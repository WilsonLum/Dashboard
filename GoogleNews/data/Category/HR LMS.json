A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization's products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful. But what if you don't work in product?\nWhat if you work in Human Resources and are in charge of learning and\ndevelopment? What if you work in the legal department and your remit is\ncybersecurity policy for the company? Do you still make a product? Do you have\ncustomers? If you believe in bringing agility to the entire organization, the\nanswer to both questions is yes.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_1162572100.jpg) Jorg\nGreuel/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/bring-product-thinking-to-non-product-\nteams?language=es)\n\nAt its most basic definition, a product is the way an organization delivers\nand captures value. For teams doing daily product work, it can feel relatively\neasy to define the words _product_ and _customer_. Whether it\u2019s a jet engine,\nan insurance policy, an online banking app, or mobile phone service there is\nan end customer who purchases and uses that product (athough, occasionally,\nit\u2019s a different person). A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization\u2019s products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful.\n\nThis is the core of organizational agility \u2014 shipping improvements to our\nproducts, observing and measuring customer behavior, determining whether we\nshould continue to improve or move on to something else. The faster we learn,\nthe faster we improve. Product teams \u2014 especially digital product teams \u2014\nunderstand this fundamentally.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t work in product? What if you work in Human Resources and\nare in charge of learning and development? What if you work in the legal\ndepartment and your remit is cybersecurity policy for the company? Do you\nstill make a product? Do you have customers? If you believe in bringing\nagility to the entire organization, the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nThe question then becomes, how do you know you\u2019ve delivered value? Or captured\nit back? In a lot of cases these teams measure success by delivering on goals\nor initiatives. Did you launch the new learning management system? Success!\nDid you deliver the new cybersecurity policy to our vendors? Great job!\n\nBut do you know if this was really the best version of that policy or\ninitiative?\n\nTo answer that question, I believe we have to apply product thinking to every\nproject, initiative, and policy we create. In doing so we begin to move our\nnon-product and tech disciplines \u2014 HR, Finance, Legal, Logistics, et al \u2014 away\nfrom an output-based mindset and closer to the agile, customer-centric view\nwe\u2019re instilling in our product teams.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: an HR business partner is charged with defining,\nevaluating, buying, and implementing a new learning management system (LMS)\nand training curriculums for the entire organization. They diligently go about\nthis task getting bids, sitting through presentations, and ultimately hiring a\nvendor to build, integrate, and deploy the LMS. Congratulations? Not so fast.\nWhat if no one uses the new system? What if staff only takes the mandatory\ncourses but never explores the additional offerings the HR business partner\nspent weeks procuring and evaluating? What if the LMS itself is unusable and\nthe email volume to the HR team triples with staff complaints?\n\nEnter product thinking. If we\u2019re going to bring our non-product teams along\nwith us on our journey to business agility we have to reframe their work with\nthe language of products and customers. This begins by rethinking the\ninitiative not as a set of boxes to tick but rather as a problem to solve for\na specific set of customers. The measure of success for that problem is not\nthe deployment of a product but instead a measurable positive change in the\nbehavior of those customers. In other words, we\u2019re working towards outcomes,\nnot outputs.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe the LMS example above in this way. Instead of asking our HR team\nto research and deploy the system, the HR Business Partner or leader should\nposition it like this:\n\nOur current professional development efforts are rarely used due to lack of\nstaff awareness, difficult to find and use systems, and a catalog of offerings\nthat are irrelevant for a modern, digital workforce. This is causing a spike\nin attrition of our most valuable employees, increasing our recruiting and\nhiring costs, and hurting organizational morale \u2014 not to mention the wasted\ncost of these systems. How might we deliver better professional development\nofferings to the entire staff and ensure they\u2019re up to date on the latest\ntrends in digital business and feel like the organization is invested in their\nsuccess? We will know we\u2019ve succeeded when we see retention rates go up by 10%\nquarter over quarter, consumption of professional development content increase\ntwofold, and cost of hiring decrease by 15%.\n\nIn reframing the work for our HR team in this way, we\u2019ve done several things:\n\n  1. We\u2019ve reframed the initiative from \u201claunch an LMS\u201d to \u201cmake our people more successful.\u201d This is inherently a customer-centric focus. In this case the customers are the employees of the company.\n  2. We\u2019ve removed any mention of a solution from the assignment. This empowers our team to generate their own ideas, evaluate those ideas and determine the best course of action to make their \u201ccustomers\u201d more successful. In turn, they are more invested in the ideas they come up with and will look more broadly for innovative solutions.\n  3. We\u2019ve set clear success criteria that ensure our teams take an active interest in understanding their customers and work to continuously improve the \u201cproduct\u201d they\u2019re putting into their hands. It\u2019s no longer enough to deploy an LMS. The HR team now has to ensure its usage and then assess whether that usage is indeed a key driver of retention, hiring costs and other metrics the organization cares about.\n\nTo reduce the risk of choosing a solution (or product) that won\u2019t achieve the\nintended results, the team now has to undertake a more iterative and\nexploratory approach. They have to generate hypotheses about how to best\nachieve the desired results articulated in their problem statement. They then\nhave to test their hypotheses, get feedback from their customers or users, and\niterate those ideas based on that feedback. Sound familiar? This is exactly\nwhat customer-facing product teams do to ensure they\u2019re always delivering and\ncapturing as much value as possible.\n\nThe odds of deploying an unusable LMS with irrelevant content decrease\ndramatically when the HR team applies product thinking to their initiative. In\nfact, the end result may not end up being an LMS at all. For some companies\nsuch systems might be replaced by tactical, high-quality. in-person trainings,\nfor example.\n\nThis idea is not limited to HR, obviously. If your legal team authors\ncontracts, then those are their \u201cproducts.\u201d Your vendors are the customers of\nthose products. If a contract is irrelevant to a particular type of vendor\nyour teams will spin multiple, costly cycles customizing their templates. To\nreduce those red-line cycles, the team needs to understand the needs of their\ncustomers and deliver the most relevant contracts for each customer type.\n\nThese concepts may not be common place yet in non-product disciplines and the\norganization may wonder where to begin. Inevitably, this kind of\ntransformation, like any major change, requires leadership support and\nunderstanding. Training a team of leaders and individual contributors to put\nthese new ways of working into action is a good place to start. Once they\nunderstand how to frame the work, explore solutions, and most importantly, let\ngo of ideas that solve the customer\u2019s problem, they can share and scale their\nlearnings with the rest of the department.\n\nProduct thinking is popular with many organizations today because it brings\nthe ideas of agility, not just a templated agile process, to the product\nteams. These ideas, however, are not limited to product and tech teams.\nOrganizational agility is a welcome transformation in every department. By\napproaching the work you do as a product with specific customers, giving your\nteams problems to solve and measuring their success with outcomes, rather than\noutputs, you create a company-wide customer-centric culture and ensure that\nwhether someone is buying a product from you, is employed by you, or contracts\nwith your organization you\u2019re always maximizing both their success and yours.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2012/05/110-Jeff_Gothelf.jpg)\n\n[Jeff Gothelf](/search?term=jeff%20gothelf&search_type=search-all) is an\norganizational designer and executive coach.

It was day four of stay-at-home orders from the\nCanadian government, in their response to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe crisis unleashed by the novel coronavirus has been unprecedented. As\nbusinesses were ordered to shutdown indefinitely, HR folks' crisis-control\nmode switched to autopilot. The responsibility of keeping businesses open by\nimplementing sustainable work-from-home strategies fell squarely upon HR's\nshoulders. They had to create safe working practices for everyone across the\norganizational spectrum - from the most senior to frontline workers who\nweren't in a position to work from home. The playing field had suddenly been\nlevelled.\n\nUnder the crisis, HR had to get creative in assigning and redeploying talent\nto the most important teams. Inevitably, many HR leaders had to navigate\nsignificant employee layoffs.\n\nFortunately, social and physical distancing have become buzzwords in an era\nwhen technology has armed us with the tools needed to stay socially connected\nbut from a distance.\n\nCompassion was the call of the day. I have seen many of my colleagues and\nclients selflessly rising to the greater need with integrity. They have been\nquick, creative, resourceful and agile in their planning and execution. If one\ncompany had to downsize, they were proactively collaborating with\norganizations that needed more people. They were also supporting each other\nthrough virtual happy hours to connect, let off steam, and check on each\nother's wellbeing.\n\nWe have all done many desktop business continuity exercises, but this is real\nlife and beyond anyone's imagination. This situation has stretched all our\ncapabilities and resilience. Through these times, character will be developed\nand revealed.\n\n**Empathy required**  \nThe first call of duty was for all leaders to become CEOs - chief empathy\nofficers. The Centre for Creative Leadership defines empathy as \"the ability\nto experience and relate to the thoughts, emotions or experience of others.\nEmpathy is more than simple sympathy, which is being able to understand and\nsupport others with compassion or sensitivity.\" It's important not to assume\nwe understand what is going on with other people and remember that this crisis\nwill affect everyone differently.\n\nSome people will be concerned about being productive while working at home and\nkeeping their children entertained and educated. Others will be concerned\nabout vulnerable relatives who they may not be able to see because of\nquarantine restrictions. With the volume of layoffs, many will be concerned\nabout their financial position and future livelihood. Gig workers will be\nconcerned about their next project.\n\nThe heroes on the front line of retail and the health sector are in vulnerable\npositions. People are anxious about the news and troubled by self-isolation\nand loneliness. The leaders I coach have had to adapt how they lead in adverse\nand ambiguous times. They need to find moments to build awareness and connect\nwith people daily. As chief empathy officers, we will listen. We will be open.\nWe will connect. We will relate. We will help. We will get through this\ntogether.\n\n**Decluttering HR**  \nAs day-10 of COVID-19's self-isolation rolled around, I was reminded of a Josh\nBersin article and the need to reset HR. I'd set myself some ambitious (and\nsomewhat unrealistic) goals to declutter my life and that got me thinking: Is\nit time to \"Kondo\" HR?\n\nThrough a period of sustained economic growth, as businesses and as HR, we\nhave become hoarders. Driven by the demand to personalize HR and the employee\nexperience, we want our organizations to have the best of everything and we\nwant to please everyone. As a result, we have layered more and more complexity\non to processes and people that were already creaking at the seams. In a bid\nto be everything to everyone, HR has suffered an identity crisis in trying to\nfind new things that work.\n\nI have found myself balancing the demands of senior leaders and the\nconflicting needs of employees. There was never a shortage of good ideas - but\nthey would not always have the buy-in to make them sustainable, so we'd\nquickly move on to the next.\n\nCOVID-19 is forcing all of us pare down our lives and, in many ways, we are\ndiscovering pleasure in the simple things that we'd taken for granted. As a\nhabitual coffee-drinker, I have now developed more of an affinity for hot\nwater! Similarly, from a job perspective, this is HR's time to discard the\nfluffy nice-to-haves and rediscover the essentials of the employee experience.\n\nWhile hoarding's nemesis, Marie Kondo, is busy decluttering her own life, HR\nhas its moment to Kondo HR. Follow the same steps. Review every process, tool,\nintervention and policy and ask your people - does it bring you joy?\n\nWork is moving online, but the HR processes need to be revisited. Back in\nearly 2019, A relatively small [survey](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-\nworkplace/digital-employee-experience-still-not-viewed-as-business-critical/)\nshowed that only 20 per cent of companies could define what they meant by\n\"digital employee experience,\" suggesting even fewer of them actually had one.\nI don't imagine things have changed much in the intervening period.\nConsequently, many companies will be seeing cracks in their digital\nenvironments, post-COVID-19.\n\nI have three simple suggestions for HR leaders to create a digital employee\nexperience to ensure they keep their people engaged and productive while\nworking remotely.\n\n  * Step back and using real insights to review your employee experience through a digital lens. Identify where you have gaps and prioritise accordingly. It will be important to focus on the items that will have the biggest impact. Onboarding people virtually will be tricky, for example, but if you don't plan to do any significant hiring, why worry now?\n  * Leverage the digital solutions that you have already, before investing in any new toys. If you have an LMS, get it out to people. Create a competition around it to generate more users and more value. Everyone is jumping on Zoom (even uninvited people apparently!) but what other platforms do you have to keep your people engaged?\n  * Monitor the sentiment of your people regularly through check-ins and leader feedback. If you continue to identify issues, I suspect most of them can be fixed by leaders taking even more time to connect with their people. If (and only if!) it still isn't working, then a very specific technology solution might be required - and there are a lot of great ones out there.\n\nIn businesses, this is the time for us to hold the magnifying glass to\npractices that no longer work and replace them with simpler, more meaningful\nones. If HR has been looking for a time to heal workforce practices, to set\nthe recalibrate button, and to reconnect with their employees, this is your\ntime.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [Building culture through the employee voice](/focus-areas/culture-and-engagement/building-culture-through-the-employee-voice/327997)\n  * [Two-fifths of millennials claim they work less compared to previous generations](/focus-areas/culture-and-engagement/two-fifths-of-millennials-claim-they-work-less-compared-to-previous-generations/328183)\n  * [After pandemic, Canadians keen to continue work-at-home options: poll](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/after-pandemic-canadians-keen-to-continue-work-at-home-options-poll/328095)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

They may be upskilled to perform better in their existing roles\nor reskilled to take on new roles in the organization and fill the skills gap\nthat is becoming common in the workplace these days.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPerformance is just one of the intended outcomes of L&D; \u2013 it also has several\nother benefits, such as employee satisfaction, future-proofing your business,\nenhanced **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)** , and increased retention. Typically, L&D; is\ncategorized as part of a company\u2019s overall talent management strategy, where\nlearning is used as a means to acquire, nurture, maximize, and retain talent.\n\nLearning and development was [Deloitte\u2019s top human capital\ntrend](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2019/reskilling-upskilling-the-future-of-learning-and-\ndevelopment.html#endnote-sup-3) in 2019. 86% of respondents to Deloitte\u2019s\nsurvey said that improving their L&D; capabilities was an \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery\nimportant issue.\u201d\n\n### **How does learning and development work?**\n\n  \nThe L&D; process can be broken down into five key steps:\n\n**1.**[ **Talent gap\nanalysis**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-gap-analysis/) **:** An assessment of your existing\ntalent landscape to identify skills shortage, improvement areas, and possible\nopportunities in line with current/future business objectives.\n\n**2\\. L &D; strategy formulation:** The selection of different L&D; components\nthat will make up the learning experience (e.g., hands-on training, executive\ncoaching, mentorships, etc.).\n\n**3\\. Procurement:** Partnerships with L&D; providers \u2013 internal and external\n\u2013 and onboarding them into the organization (could include consultants,\ncoaching organizations, L&D; technologies, etc.)\n\n**4\\. Execution:** The implementation of your L&D; strategy via the learning\npartners and technologies selected, either in groups of employees or\nindividually.\n\n**5\\. Measurement and review:** Measurement of the success of your L&D;\nprogram against the talent gap analysis initially conducted after program\ncompletion.\n\nThis five-step process encapsulates how most L&D; strategies progress. This\nprocess can be perfectly aligned with your business priorities, keeping in\nmind the budgets and timelines allocated for talent development at your\ncompany.\n\nThe last step is probably the most critical, as it reveals valuable insights\ninto which key performance indicators (KPIs) were met and which ones fell\nshort of the desired target. This will help you realign L&D; component\nselection and investment in the next learning cycle.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)\n\n### **What are the different components of learning and development?**\n\n  \nIt's essential to keep in mind the various components that make up the\nlearning experience. Typically, experts recommend following the 70:20:10 model\nwhen designing an L&D; strategy.\n\nThe 70:20:10 framework suggests that a majority of the learning happens on the\njob.\n\n  * **Employees are likely to pick up 70% of their skills through their daily jobs.**  \nThis is particularly true for young professionals who have just entered the\nworkforce.\n\n  * **Employees obtain 20% of their skills and knowledge through their peers and colleagues.**  \nThis is why it is so essential for HR to place employees in the right teams,\nassign the right managers, and ensure that the managers are trained to develop\nteam members who report to them.\n\n  * **10% of all learning happens through formal training sessions.**  \nWhile this may seem like a small number, classroom sessions continue to be\nnecessary, especially for large organizations. It helps to track learner\nparticipation and engage with large groups at the same time.\n\n  \nThe 70:20:10 framework isn\u2019t set in stone. But it is a useful rule of thumb to\nkeep in mind when evaluating and selecting the various L&D; components\navailable to you. These could include:\n\n**1.** **Mentorships:** A popular L&D; method where a dedicated mentor is\nassigned to every employee. You could also try out reverse mentoring where\nsenior professionals learn from their team members.\n\n**2\\. MOOC:** Massive open online courses (MOOC) are excellent for sharing\nshort, bite-sized content that employees can fit into their busy work\nschedules. MOOCs can be paid or free, undertaken with partial sponsorships by\nthe company.\n\n**3\\. Certifications:** End-to-end degrees that massively increase a person\u2019s\nemployability. Certifications can be transferred from one organization to\nanother, making them highly relevant across an employee\u2019s career pathway.\n\n**4\\. Hands-on training:** Domain-specific skills taught on the job or in\ncontrolled scenarios. They can be enhanced through the use of AR (augmented\nreality) and VR (virtual reality). Hands-on training is generally a mandatory\npart of the learning experience.\n\n**5.**[ **Learning management systems\n(LMS)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/) **:** A platform where companies can host\ndigitally-consumable learning material to be accessed through multiple\ndevices. The content can be created either in-house or outsourced to a\nspecialized contractor.\n\n**6.** [**Learning experience platform\n(LXP)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-your-lms/): Similar to\nan LMS, but comes with ready-to-consume content and is hosted/managed entirely\nby the L&D; partner. A good example is LinkedIn Learning.\n\n## **4 Key Objectives of a Learning and Development Program**\n\nThe objectives of employee development will vary from company to company. For\nexample, a manufacturer may want to increase the volume of items produced per\nquarter. Or a school may want to improve students\u2019 test results by upskilling\nits teachers.\n\nIn other words, the specifics of your development and learning objectives will\ndepend on the nature of your company and the area of operations. However, it\nis possible to classify these objectives into four categories:\n\n### **1\\. Business performance**\n\n  \nThe two examples we just mentioned will result in an uptick in business\nperformance through L&D.; Improved business performance is usually the top\nobjective of every development and learning activity. Essentially, it implies\nthat companies are training employees to become better at their jobs and\nmeet/exceed the business KPIs assigned to their jobs.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to business performance\ninclude:\n\n  * Increase in the volume of work completed within a stipulated time\n  * Rise in customer satisfaction scores as a result of better employee performance\n  * The ability to gain from emerging opportunities, due to new skills available in the organization\n  * Business sustainability through a period of dynamic changes (regulatory shifts, economic upheavals, digital transformation, etc.)\n\n###  \n**2\\. Employee satisfaction**\n\n  \nResearch suggests that employees value the importance of learning in the\nworkplace and would stay on with a company that invests in L&D.; [LinkedIn\u2019s\n2019 Workplace Learning\nReport](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report),\nwhich surveyed 3,000+ respondents, reaffirms this insight. A whopping 94% of\nrespondents said that they would stay on in a company that invests in their\nlearning and development.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to employee satisfaction\ninclude:\n\n  * Increase in employee retention rates\n  * Improvement in your **[employee net promoter score (eNPS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-ideas/)**\n  * Reduction involuntary turnover in the long term\n  * Lowering of employee stress, thanks to a rise in confidence and skill levels\n\n###  \n**3\\. Employer branding**\n\n  \nAnother objective to remember when formulating a learning and development\nstrategy is its impact on your employer brand.\n\nDoes your company appear to be \u201clearning-focused\u201d?\n\nDo candidates want to join your company because it will help their careers and\nlong-term growth?\n\nThese are some of the key questions that an L&D; program should answer. Most\npreferred employers in the world \u2013 the likes of Google, Amazon, and PwC \u2013\ninvest heavily in their employee\u2019s development, as it is intrinsically linked\nto their value proposition in the labor market.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to employer branding include:\n\n  * Shorter time to fill for new job roles\n  * Increase in the quality of hire\n  * Reduction in recruitment marketing costs\n  * An uptick in the number of unsolicited/inbound applicants\n\n###  \n**4\\. Individual self-actualization**\n\n  \nIn the era of new work, employees value the holistic aspects of a job as much\nas its tangible components like benefits or compensation. As a result, L&D;\nbecomes a means of self-actualization and fulfillment, allowing employees to\ntap into their full potential. And this is linked both to business performance\nas well as employee satisfaction.\n\nDevelopment and learning objectives pertaining to individual self-\nactualization include:\n\n  * The ability to reach personal improvement targets\n  * Enhanced work-life balance enabled by robust skill sets\n  * Increased employability, driving greater job security\n  * Realization of hidden potential such as leadership skills or a knack for working with data\n\n  \nCompanies should look at the above four objectives buckets before implementing\nan L&D; strategy. Let\u2019s now turn to some of the best practices that can help\nyou get it right.\n\n## **7 Best Practices for Creating a Learning and Development Strategy in\n2020**\n\nWhile the exact formula and structure for L&D; might vary based on your unique\nobjectives, several best practices can set you on the right track. Here are\nseven best practices to keep in mind when shaping your learning and\ndevelopment strategy, regardless of industry/business type:\n\n![the definitive guide to learning and development, along with definition,\nstrategies, and best practices](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

Factor in the requirements of a multigenerational workforce**\n\n  \nIn 2020, the oldest Gen-Zer turns 25, ready and qualified to take on their\nfirst job. This is also the decade when baby boomers reach their 60s,\nresulting in a spate of new learning requirements. To keep up, companies will\nhave to create multigenerational learning tracks with different learning and\ndevelopment best practices for millennials, Gen Z, Gen X, and baby boomers.\n\nTactics like reverse mentoring will be particularly useful, allowing older\nemployees to gain from the skills of digitally native millennials and Gen\nZers.\n\n### **2\\. Embrace the power of mobile learning**\n\n  \nThe mobile learning market is currently booming. By 2025, mobile learning will\ncross $42 billion, at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.5%.\n\nMobile learning strengthens the impact of that 70% of knowledge/skills\nemployees that pick up on the job \u2013 employees can quickly refer to the company\nLMS using a mobile device when they face a bottleneck at work.\n\nMobile access also gives learners the flexibility to pursue learning material\nanytime, anywhere. They could potentially turn the ideal hours spent during\ntheir commute or waiting at the airport, for example, into opportunities for\nself-learning.\n\n### **3\\. Use technology intelligently to personalize the learning\nexperience**\n\n  \nCompanies must explore how technology could enable personalized learning. With\nbusiness requirements continually evolving, and so many generations now making\nup the standard office, personalization can help you adapt to individual\nneeds.\n\nAs Jeff Freyermuth, principal research analyst at Gartner, put it: \u201cThe\ntraditional, one-size-fits-all approach to L&D; will no longer cut it in the\nnew work environment.\u201d\n\nTechnology can help create automated, intuitive, and interactive learning\nworkflows that adapt to employee behavior. This should be bolstered by regular\nsurveys to get a clear understanding of different employee personas[\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-an-\nemployee-persona/)and their diverse learning needs.\n\n### **4\\. Pay special attention to harassment and discrimination prevention**\n\n  \nIn 2020, learning and development could prove to be vital in preventing\ndiscrimination and harassment in the workplace. This, in turn, will enrich\nyour employee experience and enhance the employer brand.\n\nSome local governments such as the New York City Commission on Human Rights\nmandate companies of a specific size to conduct anti-sexual harassment\ntraining.\n\nYou can partner with specialized learning vendors in this space. You could\nalso invest in training for unconscious bias elimination, curbing the problem\nat the very roots. In these areas, tools like virtual reality are tremendously\nhelpful.\n\n### **5\\. Embed L &D; into the larger HR landscape **\n\n  \nThis best practice is all the more relevant for large enterprises. For\nworkforces with thousands of employees, L&D; is designated as a separate\nfunction, independent from HR. Over time, this could lead to an entirely\nsiloed approach, with little collaboration between HR and L&D.; As a result,\nyou have limited visibility into how your L&D; program impacts people's\noutcomes, and L&D; centers purely on business performance.\n\nTo avoid this pitfall, large enterprises should embed L&D; into their HR\nlandscape, with decision-makers such as the chief learning officer (CLO)\ncollaborating with the chief human resources officer (CHRO).\n\n### **6\\. Leverage L &D; as a tool for succession planning**\n\n  \nA rapidly aging baby boomer workforce means that there will be a wave of\nretirements in 2020, affecting thousands of senior leadership roles around the\nworld. HR must step up and action an effective succession plan. A carefully\ndeveloped learning and development strategy can help you address the gap,\nnurturing employees\u2019 latent leadership skills.\n\nTargeted measures such as one-on-one coaching and [soft skills\ntraining](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-ar-\nand-vr-are-revolutionizing-soft-skills-training-in-2019/) are suited to a\nsuccession-ready learning and development program. Further, employees who are\nassigned as mentors will acquire valuable skills, such as strategic decision-\nmaking, responsiveness, perceptivity, and conflict resolution.\n\n### **7\\. Make learning an ongoing process**\n\n  \nL&D; shouldn\u2019t be looked at as a one-off initiative. Instead, look at talent\ndevelopment as a continuous development approach by integrating learning with\neveryday workflows.\n\nThis also means that employees do not have to specifically take out time to\ncomplete their learning modules. Making learning an ongoing process, embedded\nit into the flow of work, will increase participation rates, and ensure that\nthe forgetting curve is avoided.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Future of Work: 10 Key Trends for the Next 10\nYears**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/future-of-work-key-trends/)\n\n## **Wrapping Up: Tools to Use for Learning and Development**\n\nNow that you know what learning and development is, its key objectives, and\nsome best practices, you\u2019re ready to select tools that can accelerate the pace\nof learning and strengthen its impact in your organization.\n\nSome of the top tools to look at include:\n\n  * LinkedIn Learning: An employee experience platform\n  * Moodle: A customizable open-source LMS\n  * Coursera, Udemy, and other MOOC libraries\n  * Adobe Captivate, SAP Litmos, and other cloud-based LMS\n\n  \nCompanies embarking on their L&D; journey in 2020 should keep in mind its\nvarious nuances and possibilities. There is no one-size-fits-all model \u2013 the\nunique mix of objectives, timelines, budgets, and technology dependencies at\nyour organization will determine your learning and development strategy.\n\nBut there's a clear endgame applicable across the board \u2013 making learning a\ncore element of your culture so that the company and its workforce are\nresilient to the rapid pace of transformation we are experiencing today.\n\n_Is there learning and development best practice that's proven effective at\nyour company?

Some of the main questions for HR tech in 2020 are as follows: Is it\ntime to consolidate our tech integrations or branch out? Will trends transfer\nto reality, or will they fall short of our expectations? As the owner of a\nbackground screening company, and as an expert in HR and hiring for over 30\nyears, I have five tips to see you through the decision-making process as you\nrefine your HR technology suite for 2020 and beyond.\n\n**Secure The Core Four**\n\nThere are some systems our HR teams can\u2019t live without. The \u201ccore four\u201d are\nintegral to a robust, streamlined HR strategy. HR professionals need systems\nfor recruitment, human capital management, benefits management and learning\nmanagement. Having these four systems in place will help your recruitment and\nretention strategies to succeed.\n\nUnemployment is [low](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/unemployment-rate-falls-\nlowest-level-50-years/story?id=66058946), and the labor market is\n[tight](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-employment/tight-us-\njob-market-not-attracting-new-people-to-the-labor-force-paper-idUSKCN1SQ24S).\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS), background screening systems and recruitment\nsoftware ensure you can secure top candidates quickly. My experience gives me\na unique perspective on the recruitment process. What\u2019s clear is the power of\nconnecting your ATS and screening program. This integration can move\nmountains, shaving days off your hiring turnaround time.\n\nEmployee retention is just as important as getting new employees hired and\nonboarded. All HR managers and directors understand the value of a human\ncapital management (HCM) and benefits manager, especially when the job market\nis tight and recruitment strategies are so important. Learning management\nsystems (LMS) offer discounted or free resources to your existing employees,\npromoting development that benefits both the individual and the company.\nThey're great tools to inspire loyalty and appreciation, improving your\nretention rate in the process.\n\nSecure these core four pieces of HR technology, and you\u2019ll be ready to take on\n2020.\n\n**Single Suite Or Integration Nation**\n\nThis is one of the biggest debates in HR technology. Is it better to entrust\nHR technology processes to a single provider, or should you utilize only the\nbest of each service and integrate across platforms? Celebrated HR influencer\nSteve Boese wrote on this not too long ago when he outlined [the pros and cons\nof both options](https://hrexecutive.com/single-suite-or-best-of-breed-which-\nis-better/).\n\nMy answer is to expect more from your providers\u2019 integration capabilities.\nCompanies can put in the work for your business, so don\u2019t rule out a\ncombination of the best of the best. Your partners should be willing to work\ntogether to make your processes easier.\n\n**Tried And True Or Shiny And New**\n\nI recommend selecting an experienced vendor, rather than choosing a new player\non the field, especially when it comes to HR technology. The best part about\nworking with an industry expert is that they understand when to innovate, when\nto stick with tried-and-true methods, and how to get the job done.\n\nCompanies like IBM and ADP run their prospective industries because they\ndesign new products and have the experience to back up their decisions. My\nrecommendation here is to choose a tried-and-true provider if the company is\nopen to and striving for consistent technological innovation.\n\n**Budget Versus Build It**\n\nThere are times in business when, no matter your dreams and inspiration for\nthe perfect suite of services, cost will always take priority. When it comes\nto your applicants\u2019 and employees\u2019 experiences, invest. Employees stay where\nthey\u2019re cared for; finding the right technology to assist you in taking care\nof your team should take priority.\n\nThis applies to the hiring process, benefits management, payroll, worker\u2019s\ncomp and more. It\u2019s the little things that add up, and a streamlined process\nwill elevate your company\u2019s reputation. Build your technology suite. You won\u2019t\nregret it when you\u2019re attracting top talent.\n\n**The Immediate Versus The Ultimate**\n\nPartnerships should be built to last. I\u2019ve seen how technology partners can\ncome and go after only a couple of years because they end up not being the\nright fit. Decision-makers need to consider immediate need versus ultimate\npartnerships. Prioritize partnerships over immediacy when you can. This isn\u2019t\na decision based solely on capabilities and cost, but it's a question of\ncustomer service and brand loyalty. This will be a partner you rely on in\ntimes of turmoil, and their customer service team must be able to provide for\nyour people. Cultivating the right partners keeps your company stable, your\nemployees and candidates happy, and your customers satisfied.\n\nHR tech\u2019s offerings are only going to continue to grow. Keep a keen eye on\nyour end goals and ultimate needs when the time comes to build your suite.\nIt\u2019s worth a second, or seventh, look.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Tammy Cohen](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2020/03/tammycohen_avatar_1583529502.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/tammycohen/\n\"Photo of Tammy Cohen\")\n\n[Tammy\nCohen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/tammycohen/)\n\nFounder and Chief Visionary Officer of [InfoMart](http://www.infomart-\nusa.com), a global background screening company.

This includes the\nability to capture clients' social security tax deferral options as well as\nreporting functionality for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nPaylocity also deployed new resources to educate organizations on legislative\nchanges and help employers understand and select the right aspects of the new\nlaw for the benefit of their business and employees. The company launched\ntraining sessions on the new legislation in its learning management system and\nhosted a webinar on the CARES Act with over 10,000 attendees. Paylocity also\nlooks forward to hosting a separate webinar on April 1 to discuss the critical\nways Paylocity's product suite is supporting the CARES Act and FFCRA.\n\nThe use of Community, the company's tool for improving and maintaining\nemployee engagement and communication, has more than doubled over the past\nthree weeks. Other products proving to be highly useful include Mobile,\nLearning Management System (LMS), and Surveys, all of which allow leaders to\nquickly deploy information to employees and keep them engaged.\n\nPaylocity also rolled out its Emergency Setup Dashboard to keep employees\ninformed, productive and healthy during the pandemic. Employees can use the\ndashboard to ensure employees' contact information is updated for\ncommunications, share important policy changes about remote work in light of\nsocial distancing recommendations and set up direct deposit for payroll.\n\n\"During this unprecedented time, Paylocity remains committed to our mission of\ndeeply caring for our clients and moving forward together, especially when the\nfuture of work and legislation is changing every day,\" said Steve Beauchamp,\nCEO of Paylocity. \"In addition to providing COVID-19 facts and resources,\ncommunication templates and tips on using Paylocity's solutions during this\ntime, we've also quickly enhanced our product suite to help our clients easily\ntake action on the new laws.\"\n\n**HR News:**[Capacity's New

The Answer Lies in a \u201c5M Model\u201d**\n\nIf employees get a negative impression of or face major bottlenecks in the\nworkplace in the first few months, it could drive them to leave the\norganization. So early in the employee journey, they are still not rooted in\nthe organizational culture, and this makes the separation easier. To prevent\nthis, companies need a five-step employee training plan that addresses the\nneeds of new employees head-on.\n\n![The five Ms of an effective employee training plan](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig. 1. The five Ms of an effective employee training plan**\n\n###\n\n### **1. _Mitigate_ the steep learning curve**\n\n  \nMost employees joining your company will have a steep learning curve in the\ninitial stages.\n\nThis is especially true for fresh graduates who have joined the workforce for\nthe first time. Even mid-career professionals who are transitioning from a\ndifferent field could face difficulties in acclimatizing themselves to the\nexpectations of their new roles.\n\nThese employees need to feel comfortable and confident so that they can easily\nacquire new skills/knowledge.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Conduct group onboarding:** To alleviate any newcomer anxiety, it\u2019s a\ngood idea to conduct group\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) where recruits can connect with\nother employees who are going through a similar experience.\n\nEssential employee training elements, such as compliance, workforce management\nprotocol, and HR policies, can be explained during group onboarding sessions.\n\nYou can then hold short tests, polls, and quizzes to check for knowledge\nretention \u2013 and follow up with interactive emails after one week to overcome\nthe forgetting curve.\n\n**b. Assign an \u201cearly-days\u201d mentor:** Unlike a typical mentorship program, an\nearly-days mentor wouldn\u2019t aim for outcome-focused employee training. Instead,\nthe mentor is a friend to the new employee, ready to solve queries, answer\nquestions, and assist them in their daily job.\n\nKeep in mind the 70:20:10 equation, which suggests that 70% of learning\nhappens through experience, 20% by interacting with one\u2019s immediate community,\nand 10% through formal learning. Assigning a mentor strengthens the impact of\nthat 20% in your employee training plan.\n\n**c. Allocate one week for shadowing:** By introducing employees to complex\nconcepts and theoretical knowledge, companies risk overwhelming the learner\nwhen they have just joined the organization.\n\nA designated week for shadowing allows new employees to observe their\npeers/seniors, ask questions, and gain a real-world understanding of the job.\n\n### **2. _Mobilize_ new employees\u2019 existing strengths **\n\n  \nOnce an employee has crossed the initial learning phase, it\u2019s time to nurture\nthe potential for which they were hired.\n\nAn employee may not immediately fit in with their assigned team or be able to\ncollaborate with their manager. In such situations, focus on employees\u2019\nexisting strengths so that they aren\u2019t demotivated. This is relevant\nspecifically for employees venturing into a new career path or when they have\ntaken on a new role in the organization. Several skills are inherently\ntransferable (soft skills like communication or hard skills like design) and\nshould be showcased at this stage of your employee training plan.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Adopt strength-based coaching:** Coaching is no longer limited to senior\nexecutives. Mobile platforms like Pluma make coaching sessions accessible to\nmiddle managers and frontline employees.\n\nStrength-based coaching highlights what an employee can do best and nurtures\nthis potential. This coaching tactic can also inspire employees more\neffectively than critical feedback, minimizing the risk of demotivation.\n\n**b. Find cross-department synergies:** After employees shadow their own team\nmembers in the first week on the job, allow them to shadow managers in\ndifferent departments and business units in the following weeks. This will\nhelp them understand your company's vision more clearly and help them\nfamiliarize themselves with the various departments, their roles, the bearing\nof these departments on employees' work.\n\nIn some cases, cross-departmental synergies can be leveraged at a later stage\nto address skill gaps through\n[i](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/why-\ninternal-mobility-is-key-to-building-the-workforce-of-the-future/)nternal\nmobility. That's why this step is so essential for your employee training\nplan.\n\n**c. Take a reverse-mentoring approach:** Reverse mentoring occurs when a\nsenior executive is paired with a new/junior employee to encourage a free-\nflowing, non-linear skills exchange.\n\nBy participating in a reverse mentorship, employees can forge new connections\nwith their colleagues (cutting across generational divides), and discover\nunique strengths that could add value to your company.\n\n**3. _Maintain_ a regular learning track**\n\n  \nThe first two steps focus on empowering new employees and helping them obtain\nthe soft skills needed to interact meaningfully with their teams.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to implement a formal L&D; plan that incorporates self-learning\nand classroom learning sessions in equal measure. Classroom sessions are\nvital, as they add structure to the employee learning journey and help track\ntheir progress in real-time.\n\nFor this, you would benefit from using e-learning platforms with analytics\ncapabilities.\n\nThis step comprises three further steps:\n\n**a. Offer mobile learning opportunities:** In the first few months, an\nemployee will be engaged in interactions with multiple stakeholders to find a\nfirm foothold in the organizational structure.\n\nAs a result, they may not be able to dedicate uninterrupted hours to learning\nand development. You can address this by incorporating mobile learning into\nyour employee training plan. This may prove particularly beneficial for\nmillennials and Gen Z, who are mobile-natives.\n\n**b. Ensure in-the-moment learning is available** : Coming back to the\n70:20:10 formula, 70% of all learning occurs through work experience. This\nmakes in-the-moment learning an integral component of your employee training\nplan, and even more so for employees who are new to your workflows.\n\nCoaching tips embedded in productivity applications, informative alerts, and\ntimely redirection to learning resources can help employees learn as they\nwork.\n\n**c. Leverage real-time learning data:** Employees mustn't veer from their\nlearning tracks, at least in the first few months of joining a company. You\ncan ensure this by monitoring learners' progress in real-time and sharing\nreports with the employee.\n\nThis will aid in self-motivation.\n\n### **4. _Monitor_ progress with controlled tests**\n\n  \nLearning data may not always accurately portray the progress that an employee\nhas achieved. Here\u2019s where controlled tests can make a difference. These tests\nplace the employee in real-world scenarios, urging them to try out their newly\nacquired skills for meaningful output.\n\nDo note that employees must feel like they are in a _safe_ environment when\nactioning these skills without any worries around being reprimanded.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Simulate real-world work scenarios:** Now is the time for organizations\nto incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and\nvirtual reality (VR) to test employee skills in simulated, safe environments.\nThis way, tests are decoupled from critical outcomes, but the employee still\nhas a chance to experience the impact of hands-on training memorably.\n\nYou can even embed visual cues and coaching tips into the AR/VR experience,\nacknowledging the right use of skills and alerting employees wherever they go\nwrong.\n\n**b. Hold \u201c100% ownership days\u201d:** This extends the ambit of testing a little\nfurther. On 100% ownership days, the recruit is given end-to-end\nresponsibility for a specific task, including customer interactions, decision-\nmaking, and micro-level leadership.\n\nThis component of your employee training plan allows employees to study the\nimpact of work in day-to-day situations. Of course, a manager/supervisor must\nbe present at hand to intervene if necessary.\n\n**c. Recognize learning achievements:** A significant part of monitoring\nprogress is to recognize and appreciate the milestones that an employee has\nsuccessfully crossed. This may range from a simple \u201cthank you\u201d for easing a\nteam member\u2019s workload, to a formal email announcement when the employee\nattains a mandatory certification.\n\nRecognition also allows learners to track their progress over time, motivating\nthem to accelerate their journey on the learning curve.\n\n**5. _Measure_ at increasing intervals**\n\n  \nContinuous review, along with regular fine-tuning, is essential for any\nemployee training plan, and this applies to new employees well. It is\nadvisable to increase the measurement interval on an incremental basis. The\nfirst checkpoint is every week for the first month. Then, measure learning\nprogress every month for the next quarter. Finally, move to a quarterly\nmeasurement cycle.\n\nThis will ease the learning curve we spoke about in step 1 and allow employees\nto gradually blend into your existing workforce and its culture of learning.\n\nThis step involves three elements:\n\n**a. Check for individual as well as team-wise outcomes:** Individual\nperformance can only go so far. Employees must display key traits like\nteamwork, collaboration, the ability to empathize with colleagues, and\nnecessary foresight.\n\nLearning measurement must factor in team-wise outcomes. We recommend using\npre-onboarding findings as a benchmark and assessing the value the employee\nadds to the team after joining.\n\n**b. Pay equal attention to hard and soft skills:** Too often, an employee\u2019s\nhard skills are highlighted, while their \u201csoft\u201d capabilities (which are\nequally important) pass under the radar. It can be challenging to measure\nprogress in terms of soft skills development. This is where you need peer\nreviews and 360-degree performance feedback.\n\nThe employee\u2019s team members, as well as colleagues from other teams who\ninteracted with them in the _mobilize_ stage, can rate the impact of training\nin terms of soft skills.\n\n**c. Prioritize culture fitment and add for the first year:** One cannot\noverestimate the role of culture fit, and eventually culture add in the\nemployee experience and employees\u2019 overall success in the organization.\n\nYour employee training plan must necessarily include training on the company\u2019s\nculture, from diversity and inclusion to company policies, values, and ethics.\nOnce again, use peer reviews to understand how the culture fit and culture add\nhave improved from week 1 to month 1 to quarter 1, and finally, to year 1.\n\n## **#ProTip: _Maneuver_ the New Employee Learning Experience Using the Right\nTools **\n\nTraining new employees is a multifaceted and dynamic process. No employee\ntraining plan is a set-and-forget initiative, which is why learning analytics\nis so important. Regular tests and data monitoring reveal how employees are\nprogressing across the learning track designed for them to reach their full\nproductivity potential.\n\nBy following the 5M model, companies can address both expressed and latent\nemployee expectations and streamline their learning and development path in\nthe organization.\n\nStrengthen this path further by using targeted learning tools. Here are three\nexamples of such tools:\n\n**1.**[ **SAP Litmos**](https://www.litmos.com/platform/new-employee-training)\n**:** Litmos is the learning management solution (LMS) from the global\nsoftware giant SAP. Litmos has a robust training module, which includes a\ndedicated capability for new employee training management.\n\nYou can leverage Litmos for compliance training \u2013 one of the key elements of\nany onboarding experience \u2013 as well as for knowledge dissemination in\nspecialized business, social, and technical topics. Further, Litmos is easily\nscalable based on your hiring speed and capacity.\n\n**2.**[ **Eloomi**](https://eloomi.com/) **:** Eloomi is an onboarding\nplatform that pays special attention to how you train new employees. The\nplatform has several built-in content programs that can be customized based on\nyour employee training plan.\n\nYou can reuse frequently implemented learning materials in areas such as\nsecurity and compliance. And view progress across all these paths in real-\ntime, with follow-ups via face-to-face meetings. As an additional feature,\nEloomi offers preboarding capabilities for greater candidate/employee\nengagement.\n\n**3.** [**Talmundo**](https://www.talmundo.com/onboarding-software-solution)\n**:** Talmundo\u2019s onboarding software offers an effective solution to train new\nemployees. The employee starts receiving notifications as early as 10 days\nbefore joining the company. These notifications share information on the\ncompany\u2019s overall positioning as well as job-related information.\n\nTalmundo covers the entire new-hire lifecycle \u2013 for example, at the 60-day\nmilestone, it asks onboarding employees about their specific areas of interest\nthat they would like to develop across their tenure.\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\nPlatforms like SAP Litmos, Eloomi, and Talmundo can make your employee\ntraining plan productive and successful. Coupled with the 5M model, you can\nhone a new employee\u2019s true potential and enable them to maximize their\nperformance.\n\nThe key is to anticipate initial bottlenecks, institute measures that\nstreamline the learning experience, and blend employee training with the\nworkplace experience.

With growing\nneed from clients, Paylocity saw an opportunity to \"expand the relationship\"\nby acquiring VidGrid, the press release stated.\n\nUsing videos will become more and more important for businesses as the\ndefinition of work expands, including more remote positions and other such\nchanges to the traditional office sphere. Thus, VidGrid was a choice to help\nPaylocity better respond to its customers, the press release stated.\n\nPaylocity CEO Steve Beauchamp said the implementation of videos would be\ncrucial as the world evolves.

Imbalance at Workplace\n\n![CXOtoday News\nDesk](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/698fa9b223721385ee2d50a38388d3a2?s=22&d=mm&r=g)[CXOtoday\nNews Desk](https://www.cxotoday.com/author/cxonewsdesk/) __3 weeks ago\n\n![AI](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Artificial-\nIntelligence-1.jpg)\n\nBy Prasad Rajappan\n\nAs per the research and study by the [World Economic\nForum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-\nequality#report-nav), none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and\nnor likely will many of our children. That\u2019s the sobering finding of the\nGlobal Gender Gap Report 2020, which reveals that gender parity will not be\nattained for 99.5 years. Despite several measures taken across the globe\nGender inequality remains consequential and multidimensional. We can tackle\nthe Gender Imbalance in the workplace by harnessing technologies and practices\nsuch as AI/ML, strong HR policies, capturing the female progression through\nlearning management systems and succession planning. Let us examine each of\nthese technology practices one by one.\n\n**Adopt AI/ML and Robotic Interviews in Hiring to Reduce Gender Bias**\n\nAI is disrupting every day in the life, including how organizations are hiring\ntoday. With the new technologies in the new world of AI-based hiring could\nhelp us reduce error and bias in our hiring and onboarding processes. A lot of\nresearch has highlighted an inconsistency around gender imbalance. One of the\nbiggest advantages of AI is that it is great at ignoring things. Just imagine\na scenario a person who is intellectual, ethical, and open-minded who is fair\nin the hiring practices with no intention of being gender-biased, sees a\nfemale candidate sitting in front of him. He may think that though this person\nis a woman I am not giving my evaluation with any bias in my mind. AI can be\ntrained to ignore things like anyone\u2019s gender and focus on relevant aspects\nlike experience, skills, and the potential of that person. With AI and Machine\nLearning, the algorithms can be trained in such a way that it will be blind to\ngender. Machine learning can throw up the compatible candidates who are fit\nfor the job role.\n\n**Career Progression of Female Employees through Learning Management Systems**\n\nCareer Progression is a significant tool for both organisations and their\nemployees. When any employees are confused about what are the career\ndevelopment options available to them or the Business is unclear about what\nwill be the learning path which is required to achieve the Business Outcomes,\ncareer progression delivered through learning management system can provide\nthe needed clarity. Career Progression of female employees conducted through\nLMS systems can provide the basis for an individual\u2019s learning and a guide\nagainst which they can measure their progression.\n\n**Strong HR Policies on Gender Discrimination**\n\nAt any workplace, on an average 1 out of 4 women have been either physically\nor mentally harassed. Three in ten young women (30%) said they had experienced\nsex discrimination when working or looking for work. 75% of young women and\n58% of young men said that women still face discrimination in the workplace.\nEmployers should take measures to avoid such misdemeanors to happen at the\nworkplace. It is preeminent to have a strict policy against workplace offences\nlike gender discrimination, sexual harassment, racism, bullying, and many\nmore. Each and every organization should ensure that they have strong HR\npolicies in place and for such offences they are penalized.\n\n**Accelerate Female Progression with Succession Planning**\n\nThe major reasons why succession planning and leadership development are of\nextreme importance and can help in accelerating female progression are\nrecruitment and retention of the best talent, greater leadership\nresponsibility despite the gender imbalance. With succession planning in\nplace, the progression and identification of the successor will be formal,\nSystemic, tailored, experientially based instead of the gender biases.\n\nChanges in societal attitudes have helped significantly, however, it is\nthrough harnessing the AI, machine learning, strong HR policies, capturing the\nfemale progression through learning management systems and succession planning\nin place we can remove the gender gap in business once and for all.\n\n_(_ _Prasad Rajappan is a visionary and a thought leader, who brings nearly\nthree decades of HR experience into_ reputed companies, like Reliance\nIndustries, Ernst & Young and Mahindra & Mahindra.

Stark](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/david-stark/)\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n9:20 AM\n\n[Back to Search Results]()\n\n[RSS](https://www.bicmagazine.com/departments/hr/index.rss)\n\nPrint\n\nIt's been said that if you don't have a goal, you'll reach it every time. When\nit comes to your training program, the focus is on employee education and\ndevelopment. However, the end goal for your business is to achieve a\nprofitable bottom line on your budget spreadsheet.\n\n![training.jpg](https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/12914/download/training.jpg?cb=dec26c3724014fc59d2f5beaabf05cf9)\n\nSome aspects of employee training and development will provide more idealistic\noutcomes that are practically impossible to measure. With an effective\ntraining system, you might discover that your employees perform better as a\nteam. They might be happier in their jobs and, thus, more loyal for the long\nhaul. Of course, teamwork and satisfied employees are advantageous, but they\nare not straightforward standards to measure your return on investment (ROI).\n\nThe ability to measure ROI in any business venture is vital. Here are four\nways your training program can produce returns for your employees' development\nand, ultimately, for your end goal.\n\n**Collecting data**\n\nTo measure your training program's ROI, you need to know how much time your\nemployees are spending on training. How many modules have they completed (or\nnot completed)? Are they engaging with the curriculum? Sure, your training\ndepartment can do the recordkeeping; however, consider that a computer-based\ntraining software, such as a learning management system (LMS), can easily\ncapture and track all of your data, eliminating data management issues and\nproviding quick access to current data reports.\n\n**Considering the costs**\n\nWill executing and maintaining a training program provide a desirable return?\nIs it more cost-effective to outsource your program or host it in-house? These\nare just a couple of the questions your management team will need to discuss\nwhen considering what your employee development system costs and how much you\nare willing to invest. Unless you have a highly skilled team in your training\ndepartment, taking advantage of a qualified e-learning provider is a training\nroute worth pursuing. A reliable program might include upfront costs, but the\nbenefits of its efficiency and effectiveness will pay off.\n\n**Tracking training results**\n\nBalancing the bottom line by monitoring performance, productivity and safety\nrecords will offer an undeniable measuring tool as you calculate your ROI.\nTracking the costs involved will allow you to measure your results based on\nwhat you've invested and what you gain.\n\n**Saving money**\n\nOne factor in forecasting your ROI is determining what you will save as a\nresult of investing in your training program. Saving payable work hours by\noutsourcing your training program is one way to measure the monetary value of\nyour return. You may also notice that due to longevity among your employees,\nlimiting how many employees you train will decrease your future training\ncosts. Perhaps, though, the most valuable elements in regard to monetary\nsavings are maintaining compliance and avoiding safety and legal risks.\n\nROI calculations are how you measure the monetary benefit of your investment.\nThe standard formula for computing your ROI for training is: ROI (percentage)\n= ((monetary benefits \u00e2 training costs)/ training costs) x 100. ROI may also\nbe measured in terms of decreased per-item product cost or time.\n\nThere are several paths a company can take when deciding on an employee\ntraining plan. Which approach you choose to implement is a matter of\nconviction, what your company is comfortable with and where your management\nteam finds value. Some paths, however, may not contribute to measuring the\ndistinct monetary benefits of your curriculum.\n\nWhether through increased revenue or decreased product cost and time, an LMS\nis a worthwhile and measurable investment to consider that will increase the\nmonetary return of your training program.\n\n**For more information, visit www.overnitecbt.com or call (888) 228-2473.**\n\n#### Tags\n\n[Training & Human Resources](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/tag-training-\nhuman-resources/) [BIC Alliance\nMember](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/tag-company-review/) [Inside\nIndustry](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/inside-industry/) [Current\nIssue](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/current-issue/) [OverNite Software\nInc.](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/overnite-software-inc./)\n\nby [David Stark](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/david-stark/)\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n9:20 AM\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BICMagazine1/)\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/bicmagazine)\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCIzppnXMoyKq1EqgfycklQ)\n[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/24772832/)\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bic_magazine/)\n\n![](//bicalliance.img-\nus3.com/admin/bicmagazine_logo_spot_2.png?r=0.5133610582347545)\n\nEmail*\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nCompany*\n\nBIC Magazine Newsletters*\n\nIndustry Report Weekly Enewsletter\n\nResources Monthly Enewsletter\n\nBIC & Industry Events\n\nPlease verify your request*\n\nSubscribe\n\n![](https://design1-wc.metropublisher.net/downloads/11118/download/BIC-white-\nlogo.svg)\n\nConnecting people in business and industry with one another for the betterment\nof all.

Let\u2019s take a look at the five key trends that the **[Learning\nManagement System (LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-a-learning-management-system-lms/) **space is witnessing\nand will continue to develop this year, what these trends mean for\norganizations and their employees and how these would shape the future of\nwork.\n\n### **1\\. The Rise of Multi-channel Learning**\n\n  \nWith millennials quickly becoming the predominant generational demographic at\nthe workplace, organizations need to prepare for a workforce that is not only\ntech-savvy but also tech-dependent. There is also a clearly observable shift\nin terms of the applicability of learning and training. Multi-channel learning\nallows not only access to anytime-anywhere learning but also faster\napplication of skills learned or upgraded.\n\nChanges in the format and processes of LMS mean that organizations need to pay\ncloser heed to the needs of employees in the context of business needs. When\nit comes to upgrading [**learning and development**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nlearning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)frameworks, **Skip Marshall, HCM\nTechnology Executive at DXC Technology** believes that it is essential to\nclearly communicate the immense value of upgrading L&D; frameworks and in\nthat, organizations face challenges in three core aspects:\n\n**Strategic planning** \u2013 Organizations need to start with business objectives\nin mind\n\n**Breaking down silos** \u2013 All business stakeholders must be vested and believe\nin the solution\n\n**Undergoing change management** \u2013 Change is an inevitable part of the\nbusiness. It is important to view the speed of change as an opportunity to\ntransition to more user-friendly, flexible and inclusive learning systems.\nObtain and achieve key business stakeholder support across business groups, to\nhelp drive the solution.\n\nWith the evolving format of learning, it is wise to bear in mind that the\ncontent that needs to be curated for multi-channel learning needs to be\nadapted to the changing expectations of learners on these channels. Snackable,\npage-turner content is what works best in today\u2019s fast-paced work ecosystem\nwith a seemingly diminishing attention span.\n\n### **2\\. From LMS to LXP**\n\n  \nSkip is of the opinion that the \u201cdriver for both employees and management in\nshifting from traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) to Learning\nExperience Platforms (LXPs) is the shift toward learning curation and engaging\ncontent, which has driven the industry to develop solutions and platforms that\ncan provide engaging learning experiences.\u201d\n\nLearning has evolved to focus on how such experiences can not only make\nlearning more engaging but also drive actionable knowledge that directly ties\nto the learner/worker and business performance. With this, there has naturally\nbeen a significant shift from prescriptive learning to subscription learning,\nfrom a top-down approach to learning to an essentially learner-driven model.\n\n**Shelley Osborne, Head of Learning and Development at Udemy,** points out\nthat, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing pervasive changes throughout the workforce with new\ntechnologies and increased automation impacting more and more jobs. Skills are\nthe new currency of the global economy and we all need to be in a state of\ncontinuous learning to keep up. As we\u2019re witnessing demand for online learning\nfrom organizations around the world, it\u2019s clear that the training and learning\nsolutions of the past aren\u2019t going to be what propels us into the future.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of LXPs is their platform fluidity and this ties\nin with the trend of multi-channel content. Moreover, with improved technology\nand connectivity, experts who were once unreachable are now available on-\ndemand and can create value for employees/learners.\n\nThat is where the learner experience features in the puzzle. Organizations\nneed to learn to help their employees learn better.\n\n### **3\\. A Personalized Learning Experience**\n\n  \nAn important benefit that LXPs provide is the operational value to the\norganization with micro-level reporting and the opportunity for deep\nanalytics, creating meaningful impact for both the learner and the\norganization. Additionally, LXPs provide learners with a collaborative, self-\ndriven journey that is engaging and well-circulated among peers and fellow\nlearners. Skip also rightly mentions that, \u201cToday\u2019s learners want learning\nthat is available on the go, modality agnostic and quick to consume.\u201d\n\nOrganizations are thus in the race to provide a more inclusive approach that\nis personalized, aligns with specific learning styles and incorporates micro-\nlevel reporting, deep analytics, quality content curation, peer sharing, and\ncommunity building. This is where speed and relevancy provide the best value\nfor all stakeholders. Learners, whether millennials or otherwise, are used to\na world where all communication is personalized. Learning content needs to\nspeak to them individually as well.\n\nShelley states that \u201cIn the era of Netflix and Amazon where every interaction\nis individually personalized, employees have consumer-grade expectations, and\nlearning is no exception to that.\u201d She sites the Udemy 2017 Workplace Stress\nstudy, that found that 46% of employees say they want learning that\u2019s\npersonalized to their needs. Long gone are the days of cookie-cutter, static\ncorporate trainings! Because every learning journey is different, it\u2019s\ncritical for organizations to have the ability to provide customized learning\nexperiences for every employee based on the challenges they face in their\nrole, their career aspirations, and their personal preferences.\n\nBy viewing technology as an enabler, Skip says organizations can benefit from\ninnovation in the eLearning space including advances in cloud computing, which\nhas made it easier to manage change with speed and dependability while also\nallowing the organization to add relevant personalization. Incorporating\nemployee recognition programs that reflect the organization\u2019s core values and\nmotivate learners to become more self-driven and serve as valuable coaches to\nothers is a great way to encourage learners on their individualized learning\njourneys.\n\n### **4\\. Mapping the ROI of Learning**\n\n  \nWhat once could have been dismissed as castles in the air and would have been\nan ordeal to get managerial buy-in for is now tangible, measurable and\ntransparent \u2013 the return of investment on LMS and other L&D; endeavors.\n\n**Hawley Kane** , **Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development,\nSaba Software** feels that, \u201cHands down we see the connection of learning to\nperformance as being the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here\u2019s the crux of it: For\nhigh-performing organizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the\nbehavior that drives performance. Learning and performance management do not\nmerely co-exist - they are dependent on one another.\u201d\n\nHawley adds that to deliver learning experiences that move the needle on\nperformance, talent leaders need to empower employees to drive their own\ndevelopment with learning that is aligned to individual, team and business\ngoals. By thinking in terms of business outcomes and focusing L&D; programs on\nspecific behaviors, skills, or competencies, you can solidify the learning-\nperformance connection to achieve the results that matter to your business.\n\n\u201cParticular trends that are generating a lot of client interest right now are\nthe focus on measuring the business/operational impact of learning and the\nparallel trend of Learning Experience Platforms (LXPs) and learning systems\nintegration,\u201d says **Geoffrey Bloom, Principal Consultant at LEO Learning.**\nHe adds that the combination of these trends facilitates a much deeper\nunderstanding of what training is working (and why!) and can create a much\nmore personalized learning experience too. Identifying what works and what is\nvalued also has the potential benefits of increasing quality and relevance and\nreducing waste while keeping the ROI in mind.\n\nWith technology moving the needle on the evolution of learning systems and\ne-learning thriving, organizations now have easier access to learners\u2019\nprogress, data on learning behavior as well as a deeper understanding of the\n(often real-time) impact of learning on business performance.\n\n**Learn More:** **[A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)**\n\n### **5\\. A Range of Choices**\n\n  \nA key trend for the year ahead seems to be the sheer boom of new and upgraded\nLMS solutions. What should companies keep in mind when choosing the \"right\"\neLearning solution?\n\n\u201cWhen evaluating a learning solution, it\u2019s really important for companies to\nassess what the business objectives are that they\u2019re aiming to impact\u201d, says\nShelley. She adds that by evaluating what is happening within the business and\nidentifying opportunities for improvement, implementing the right learning\ninitiatives will not only satisfy employees but can also impact the bottom\nline. There are many high-growth organizations that require content on\nfreshest tools and technology to stay competitive. Finding the right solution\nin our dynamic marketplace is thus the key to upskill and reskill quickly.\n\nWith multiple LMS offerings providing thousands of real-world experts and\nfresh content, organizations need to be able to choose wisely. Having the\nwrong LMS could prove to be costlier than not having one at all.\n\n## **Learning to Learn**\n\nAccording to a recent report by Deloitte, the half-life of skills has\ndecreased to only about five years. Shelley makes the case for reinventing our\nskills by pointing out that in a career lifespan of about 50 years, with the\nlife span of skills dipping low, we will need to reinvent ourselves about 10\ntimes. For example, if you think about something as broad as the marketing\nindustry, the skills required today look nothing like what was necessary 10 or\neven five years ago. The rate at which technology has impacted every industry\nhas made it critical for employees to constantly be ready to adapt and learn\nthe newest skillset. How can organizations enable that? Well, the difference\nbetween a successful training program and one that fizzles out, is often the\nstakeholder buy-in. While curating the right learning module and content is\nimportant, it is also imperative to create a culture of learning where\nlearning is normalized in the workplace and all stakeholders are empowered to\nlead change.\n\n**_What are key trends in LMS that you foresee?

This can undermine\neffectiveness and harm productivity.\n\n> Good decision making must be based on accurate and relevant information, but\n> firms frequently do not effectively assess their people\u2019s capabilities.\n> Instead, human resource (HR) teams rely on assessments that are just about\n> \u2018good enough\u2019, which means they do not base decisions on valid, reliable,\n> fair and defensible information.\n\nThese \u2018good enough\u2019 assessment solutions include pen and paper, basic learning\nmanagement systems (LMS) or other simple software tools. But these often\ncreate issues for HR and learning and development teams.\n\nJennifer Johnson, Chief Customer Officer, Questionmark, said: \u201cWhen you think\nabout how much financial data is used to inform decisions, it\u2019s extraordinary\nthat firms put so little premium on the management information that matters\nmost: what their people can do.\u201d\n\nQuestionmark research reveals the main problems with \u2018good enough\u2019 assessments\nthat HR teams report.\n\n**_Failing to assess what they want or need to know:_** one of the biggest\nconcerns for firms is that pen and paper or basic LMS assessments are not\nrobust. Organizations cannot be sure that the \u2018good enough\u2019 assessments they\ncreate are valid, fair or that they are even assessing what they should be.\n\n**_Vulnerability to cheating:_** with pen and paper exams, LMSs or basic and\nunsecure software solutions, candidates can easily share details of\nassessments with those yet to take a test. This undermines the credibility of\nresults and does not give organizations the insight they seek.\n\n**_Time-consuming:_** pen and paper tests take time to organize, mark and to\ndistribute results. Often these assessments mean supervised sessions need to\nbe organized which creates logistical problems for both employers and staff.\n\nJennifer Johnson, Chief Customer Officer, Questionmark, continued:\n\u201cOrganizations know they need to assess their staff, but they undermine their\nown goals by choosing solutions which are rarely \u2018good enough\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the short term they can be time-consuming and difficult to operate. In the\nlong run, organizations may not be testing the knowledge or skills to the\nscale needed to do their job properly.\n\n\u201cThey may find it difficult to take relevant action based on reliable\ninformation. Organizations that fail to use robust assessments could face\ndisputes or, in areas of regulated activity, even compliance fines.\u201d\n\n**_Why assessments need to be valid, reliable, fair and defensible_**\n\nOrganizations recognize that assessments help them to make informed decisions\nand unlock their organization\u2019s potential.\n\nBut these decisions must be based on valid, reliable, fair and defensible\nassessments. If they are, they can make a real and lasting difference to an\norganization\u2019s performance.\n\nQuestionmark enables partners to overcome the issues with pen and paper, LMS\nor other basic software assessments.\n\nJennifer Johnson, Chief Customer Officer, Questionmark, continued: \u201cCustomers\ntell us that with valid, reliable, fair and defensible assessments, we help\nthem to make informed decisions. Moreover, they tell us that those decisions\nhave a positive impact on their organization and help improve performance.\u201d\n\nThe\n[report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questionmark.com%2Fdownload-\nthe-need-to-know-report%2F&esheet=52189410&newsitemid=20200316005436&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=report&index=3&md5=befd4c74bc54b3925ed730b6c1eb9bdf) is based on\nresearch from Questionmark customers who now use the platform to gather the\ninformation that will enable them to make good decisions.\n\n[Download the full\nreport](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questionmark.com%2Fdownload-\nthe-need-to-know-report%2F&esheet=52189410&newsitemid=20200316005436&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Download+the+full+report&index=4&md5=b70cafe52db8b9f115bd90a2c30f8e53)\n\n**###**\n\n**About Questionmark**\n\nQuestionmark provides a secure enterprise-grade assessment platform and\nprofessional services to leading organizations around the world, delivered\nwith care and unequalled expertise.

is a must-have for many employees today. According to the consultant\ngroup, Guthrie Jensen, 68% of workers consider [training and development the\nmost important company benefit](https://guthriejensen.com/blog/statistics-\nemployee-training/).\n\nAnd these educational perks don\u2019t just result in more engaged employees.\n[Companies that invest in employee\ntraining](https://guthriejensen.com/blog/statistics-employee-training/) also\nhave a 24% higher profit margin than companies that don\u2019t.\n\nProviding learning and development opportunities to your employees should be a\nno-brainer, but the costs can still be a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHolding in-person classes or sending productive employees away to seminars is\nexpensive. Businesses want to train employees while staying within budget.\n\nLearning management systems (LMS) offer a cost-friendly alternative to\ntraditional training sessions. They\u2019re used by businesses to help employees\nlearn and grow in their jobs - without breaking the bank.\n\n## What is a learning management system?\n\nA learning management system delivers and tracks educational and training\ncontent online. E-learning tools include customizable content, mobile lessons\nand gamification. A LMS is used by companies to onboard and train employees,\nand it can improve engagement and retention.\n\nHere are five cost-friendly training ideas using LMS software.\n\n## 1\\. Offer on-demand training and professional development\n\nEmployees are more likely to stay with a company when they\u2019re offered\nprofessional development opportunities, such as management skills or sales\ntraining.\n\nThe cost, however, of hiring instructors, renting a physical classroom and\ncoordinating times when all employees can attend classes can often be too\nhigh.\n\nLMS software provides on-demand classes that employees can access online or\nthrough mobile devices. That means businesses save on teachers, facilities and\nlost productivity.\n\nVendors often use a software-as-a-service (SaaS) pricing model, so customers\npay a subscription fee instead of a large upfront cost. Typically, the fee is\n$5 or less per learner, per month.\n\nIn addition, having managers run training sessions isn\u2019t always a good idea.\nThey may not have the experience or time necessary to prepare course materials\nor accurately assess performance.\n\nOn the other hand, LMS software can help employees learn efficiently and\neffectively, because they\u2019re designed using teaching best practices. These\ninclude microlearning, multimedia, pre- and post-training assessments,\nconvenient access and individual learning paths.\n\n## 2\\. Onboard new employees\n\nStudies show engaged employees stay with companies longer, and engagement\nbegins with a structured onboarding program.\n\nLMS software can provide educational materials to help new hires get\nacclimated to your company\u2019s culture and the responsibilities of their role.\n\nBecause some solutions include more features than you would ever possibly\nneed, it pays to find a vendor with a per-use pricing plan. This allows\nclients to opt out of certain parts of the software and pay only for what they\nput to use.\n\nThis could mean being charged based on certain modules, the number of active\naccounts or a specific piece of content. It depends on the arrangement made\nbetween the vendor and client.\n\nPrices generally range from $1 to $10 per use. Companies that don\u2019t need to\ntrain employees regularly or only need an LMS platform to onboard new hires\nshould consider this option.\n\n## 3\\. Provide online industry certifications\n\nSome industries or jobs, such as human resources, healthcare and safety,\nrequire certifications or continuing education credits.\n\nIn the past, this meant employees had to travel and miss work to attend days-\nlong seminars and classes. Now, an LMS solution can help businesses with these\nindustry-specific requirements either by providing on-demand content available\nin its internal library or by partnering with third-parties to deliver\nlessons.\n\nAdditionally, LMS software can help administrators track which employees need\nadditional credits and when certification must be renewed.\n\nIn this situation, vendors usually charge companies per course. Compared to a\nper use pricing plan, there\u2019s a premium, since the content is specialized for\ncompliance-focused industries. However, this option should still be much\ncheaper than in-person certification classes.\n\n## 4\\. Try open-source or free versions of LMS software\n\nMany companies want the ability to deliver training and education but don\u2019t\nneed all the bells and whistles that come with advanced software. In this\ncase, open-source or free versions of LMS solutions may be a good option, as\nthey generally include basic functionality and provide access for a limited\nnumber of users.\n\nOpen-source LMS software has source code that\u2019s publicly available. Companies\ncan download, install and customize the software on their own, for free. Some\nLMS vendors also offer free versions of their software.\n\nBusinesses that choose these options will still have to consider\nimplementation, customization, integrations and maintenance. In particular,\ninstalling and customizing open-source software can be complicated for\ncompanies that haven\u2019t used an LMS before, and there\u2019s no support if something\ngoes wrong.\n\nCompanies that choose this route should also have a knowledgeable in-house IT\nteam or hire implementation consultants. But if your company already has the\ntechnical know-how, using open-source software can provide a cost-friendly\nalternative.\n\n## 5\\. Use a premade course library or build custom content\n\nOne of the difficulties of training employees is finding relevant content to\nyour business.\n\nIn response, many LMS vendors offer course libraries with premade lessons for\na variety of industries, from safety to workplace ethics to sales. Companies\nshould research vendors to see if they have content for their specific needs.\n\nBusinesses that have more site-specific requirements, such as assembly line\nprocedures, often rely on third-party professionals to create training videos.\nHowever, this can be a costly process.\n\nLMS software provides course authoring tools that can help organizations\ncreate course content using templates or from scratch. And it\u2019s not generic\ncontent either. The software can handle a range of content from site-specific\nvideos to PowerPoint slides and also make interactive quizzes and games.\n\nIf your company doesn\u2019t have the resources to create this content, some\nvendors can also create custom training courses. This service may be charged\nper hour or as a one-time fee. But the benefit of using an LMS content creator\nversus a third-party is that the content will be designed to be used in their\nspecific software.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nInvesting in an LMS solution shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. You should make sure\nto talk with potential users who\u2019ll receive training and figure out which key\nperformance indicators will be affected. If implemented correctly, however,\nthe software can significantly reduce your overall training costs.\n\nYou can find more details on expenses in this [2019 LMS pricing\nguide](https://www.betterbuys.com/lms/lms-pricing-guide/).

collaborate.\n  * **Recognition Tools** \\- Tools for employees to provide peer to peer recognition and badges to reinforce/drive organizational culture across virtual teams.\n  * **Goals/OKR -** Align key objectives, see contributions, and progress on strategic initiatives.\n  * **Ongoing Check-ins** \\- Check in with your team members periodically, keep teams aligned, and help them be productive.\n  * **Learning (LMS)** \\- Continue to develop your people with easy to use online training tools.\n  * **Survey(s)** \\- Get feedback on how people are doing and what they need to be successful in a virtual environment.\n  * **Employee Feedback** \\- Tools for employees to provide real-time feedback to drive development, call out good work, and address critical issues.\n\nFor

The execution of the gamification tool makes adapting all the more captivating and easy to understand for the clients. Gamification is finding a market in the corporate world as HR administrators know about its mechanics and results, much the same as in group building programs.  \n\n  2. **Virtual Tutoring-** Artificial intelligence in the LMS framework can make virtual tutoring tools that depend on the client's connections. The LMS makes a channel for correspondence that relies upon the extent of AI and speaks with the client through virtual mentors and they act through the voice and furthermore enable the LMS to offer physical, verbal or gestural reactions.  \n\n  3. **Highly Intuitive Content-** The content that is provided to the user is improved and almost created to their requirements with the artificial intelligence software in the learning management system. The capacity of expectation and flexibility of the AI enables the substance to take on qualities identified with the linguistic arrangement of the understudy, making a relationship of high commitment between the client and the subjects to be created. This converts into more easy to use content material, which communicates in their language and gives intelligence components as indicated by their preferences and level of information.  \n\n  4. **Talent Management-** The HR professionals and school counselors hinge on Talent Management systems in former times. This helps them to identify knowledge gaps in employees or students to bring about their progress. The advanced Learning Management System in the present times go beyond enrolling students and delivering course materials in a spur-of-the-moment. To speed the students learning with the right course material, the HR professionals are integrating Talent Management.  \n\n  5. **Mobile Learning-** Mobile technology has reshaped the LMS dynamics with numerous technology services. Get into the learning content anywhere, anytime, irrespective of the device to better allow learning at the point of requisite. Mobile apps, HTML5 sites, and other mobile functionality will be the next normal for Learning Management System.  \n\n  6. **Better Content with Artificial Intelligence in LMS-** One of the most noteworthy advances that AI brings to the LMS stage and their clients have to do with content. By methods for AI, the content previously taught can be dissected and improved to support the understudy. With the assistance of the AI, content makers can access information on understudy progress and the degree of understanding they accomplished when taking the courses and in this way, work to improve it.  \n\n  7. **Interactive video-based learning-** A long time back the digital marketers and business owners had understood the supremacies of videos. The good news attached to it is that we will witness additional reinforcement of this medium in eLearning in 2019. As videos become the overwhelming focus, an expanding number of LMS stages will be seen coordinating videos in practically the entirety of their learning frameworks. On account of the developing fame of the cloud, educators would now be able to coordinate training videos in main SaaS-based learning the board framework, and make learning simpler and engaging for students.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n##  \n**To conclude-**\n\nYou can witness numerous benefits with the influx of artificial intelligence\nin LMS. From the way content is delivered to the communication of producing a\nmassive impression on the impacts on the costs of executing a LMS platform,\nits benefits can range much.

Or could it be a warning call for businesses\nto better prepare and respond swiftly to unexpected workplace disruptions? The\nlatter seems to be the likely scenario, especially in India, where an\nunprecedented nation-wide lockdown of 21 days has sent businesses spiraling\ninto uncharted territory.\n\nHistorically, India has always trailed behind western countries in achieving a\nremote work culture, and not for a lack of inclination from employees. A\nrecent survey revealed that over one half of Indian workforce, 53%, stated\nthat they would rather choose telecommuting, while a majority of the\nworkforce, 61%, are seeking to achieve better work-life balance, less stress\nand lesser commute. Likewise, a study by global research firm IPSOS revealed\nthat 57% Indian employees frequently telecommute and almost a third of them\nwork remotely each day.\n\nTelecommuting, gig-working or remote working has gained considerable traction\nwith Indian employees, given the availability of advanced technology that\nenables the same kind of performance like it does in a brick and mortar\nbusiness; and hiring managers are already predicting that remote work will be\nthe way of the future. Essentially, employees no longer feel the need to be in\nan office setup to satisfy their KPIs and professional goals. And, India\u2019s\nfast growing economy coupled with its young and digitally literate workforce\nand the availability of high-speed Internet, the country sits favorably a step\ncloser to becoming a remote work hub.\n\nSo, how do you achieve remote working readiness to respond to potential\ndisruptions, while also rethinking the workplace as a whole? Well, while\nworking remotely, a business must operate within an entirely different set of\nrules as opposed to a traditional workplace. And, it is imperative for\nbusinesses to focus on skilling and preparing their employees to quickly adapt\nto remote working.\n\nTransforming a traditional business to remote working can certainly be\ndaunting as businesses won't have the luxury of starting all over again which\nwould allow them to plan for a remote infrastructure.\n\nHere are few smart steps that Indian businesses can take to achieve remote\nworking readiness, in the short as well as long term, without impacting\nproductivity and growth:\n\n_**Accept the situation & move swiftly **_\n\nA no-brainer for businesses in today\u2019s dog-eat-dog markets, businesses must\nquickly come to terms with the present situation, do what they need to analyze\nit and make swift decisions to adopt an effective remote working strategy.\nSimply ignoring the situation and hoping it goes away cannot be a strategy.\nUntil the unfathomable force of our combined willpowers subdues the deadly\nvirus spread, we are better off doing what we do best \u2013 plan and execute. Plan\nas if there is no hope and execute in ways that helps you remain operational,\nbe it asking as many employees to work remotely. Gather information on what is\nneeded to make this happen and rally leadership and client-facing employees\nfrom all functions, including HR, managers, IT, communications, and others.\n\n_**Assess and improve IT availability (hardware & software) **_\n\nIn a country like India, where critical governance decisions pertaining to the\npandemic happen overnight, this step proves to be extremely critical and a\nmake-or-break for any business. Start by inventorying IT availability, be it\nlaptops, licensed software, communication tools etc. While physically testing\nemployees\u2019 comfort level on certain applications, including critical\ncommunication/ messaging tools can be daunting, it is key to offer some kind\nof training to address gaps, because a client-facing team with the lack of\nknow-how can be a real reputation-killer in real-time. Inventory company-owned\ndevices that could be lent to employees or establish clear and effective BYOD\nguidelines that don\u2019t break any data privacy regulations.\n\n_**Leverage the Cloud to centralize your business**_\n\nToday, data is the most valuable commodity for any business on the planet.\nWhile transitioning to a remote work environment, businesses will need a clear\nand effective data retention and protection plan and having all your data\norganized centrally for all teams to access. While the Cloud is a must-have\nfor any business, getting critical data on to the Cloud (if not already) in\ntime can be a pressing challenge. So, for businesses waiting to host their\nsoftware, tech products, proprietary information on the cloud, now is that\ntime. In addition, leverage cloud-based platforms, including CRMs, HRMS, LMS\netc. that can be accessed anywhere, anytime and on any device, giving the\nremote workforce access to important information, files, while also engaging\nwith each other.\n\n_**Set clear remote working guidelines & expectations **_\n\nA sudden transition to remote working can be challenging for any business,\nespecially if there are no remote working guidelines in place for any employee\nhistorically. The sudden change in environment can certainly hamper engagement\nand productivity. The very first step to creating an effective remote work\nstrategy is to specify the company\u2019s policy on remote working and clarify\nrules that need to be followed. Tracking employees in a remote environment can\nbe a nagging challenge for HR pros, and calls for clear guidelines around work\nhours and accountability.\n\n_**Address the workforce & subdue panic**_\n\nLastly, while you address remote work transition challenges, it is highly\nimperative for businesses to address the employees, answer key questions,\noffer support and help subdue the panic caused, not just by the pandemic\nalone, but also the sudden disruption in their work life. Make available\npandemic awareness information and videos, leverage your partnerships to share\nimportant healthcare and hygiene related knowledge, and above all, communicate\na message of solidarity with the employees and create a sense of reassurance\nthat will ease their panic and help them work normally.\n\nThis is not the first time the entire business world has been shook by a\nhealthcare emergency, neither will it be the last time. Global pandemics like\ntoday\u2019s Covid-19 are no less than a curse, and mankind will continue to brave\nsuch emergencies and emerge, if not unscathed, but surely learned on the other\nside.\n\n_Stay home. Stay safe!_\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Life @ Work](/category/organizational-culture/life-at-\nwork?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=life-at-work \"Browse more in: Life @\nWork\"),

The many features of\nan LMS have made it a popular choice among organizations and educational\ninstitutions. Integrating HR with LMS has several benefits and here\u2019s a list\nof six such benefits.\n\n####  1.Easier and Accurate Data Entry\n\nLMS requires data entry of all employees and so does the HRIS. Integrating\nboth of them means that you only need to enter the data once which will save\nyou the time of having to enter the data twice. All employee information like\neducational background, experience etc. are required for both the systems, so\nit\u2019s better to integrate them so that you just have to enter all the\ninformation once and you\u2019re done.\n\nDual information entry also means room for error. There\u2019s a higher possibility\nof data discrepancy if you have to enter data twice. Even a minor error of a\ndigit or letter can change the data records and cause problems. So the\nintegration of both the systems is going to be highly beneficial for data\nentry purposes.\n\n####  2\\. Identify Talent\n\nLMS tracks a trainees\u2019 progress and sends regular updates and reports to the\nmanagement. This progress tracker and records will help the HR identify top\ntalent in the organization, which will further help them allocate the trainee\nto the correct work profile. After identifying the talented resources of the\norganization, an LMS will enable you to provide further training to make them\nmore skilled and resourceful.\n\nOn the other hand, those trainees who may be lacking in their progress can get\nregular feedback and intervention from the HR, which will ensure that they do\ntheir best to improve on their training and courses.\n\n####  3\\. Easier Induction and Onboarding Process\n\nWhen a new employee is hired, the HR needs to conduct their induction and\nonboarding process. Integrating this with the LMS will make it easier to train\nemployees. Each time an employee is hired, they can be trained and inducted\nwith the LMS, making the training and induction process easier, time-saving\nand diverse in terms of its teaching methods.\n\nThe feature of accessibility in an LMS is the most beneficial for the HR. An\nemployee sitting anywhere at any time can receive training and the courses and\nlessons can be managed by the organization.\n\n####  4\\. Effective Online Training\n\nWhile the online training that LMS provides makes it easier to train\nemployees, it\u2019s a more effective form of training as well. LMS provides the\nanalytics of the data of an employee to provide more personalized results,\nbased on which you can get a complete record an overview of the progress of an\nemployee. It will show you their job description, past and present\nperformances, and their training progress. This will become difficult if you\ndon\u2019t integrate your HR with LMS because then you\u2019ll have to analyze the data\nfirst and then compile the information, whereas an LMS does this for you\nautomatically.\n\n####  5\\. Analytics and Patterns\n\nIf you integrate LMS with HR, you will be able to use the LMS data and\nprogress reports to analyze patterns like training to turnovers, promotions\ndue to training, contentment with training, work productivity with training.\nThis will further help the managers in making decisions regarding promotions,\ntrack the productivity of employees which will help managers take measures to\nimprove work productivity and turnovers. All of these will help the\norganization\u2019s overall work productivity.\n\n####  6\\. Cost Saving\n\nInstead of discarding your entire HRIS because you don\u2019t like the way your LMS\nworks with it, you can simply get an LMS that you know will work for your\norganization\u2019s needs. The [LMS software selection\nprocess](https://elearningindustry.com/lms-quote) is much more affordable and\ncost effective than getting a whole new HRIS.\n\n####  Conclusion\n\nLMS integration with HR is going to be very beneficial for an organization. It\nwill save time which means cost saving and also produce higher work\nproductivity. It\u2019s important to train employees if you want them to manage\ntheir responsibilities better. Tracking their progress and performance is also\nimportant to make any changes in the training process of the company for\nbetter results. LMS makes multiple jobs possible on one platform. You don\u2019t\nneed to segregate the work of HR and training with LMS integration.\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

But as learning evolves, tried and true methods\nare becoming old hat as innovation holds the key to employee engagement.\nRobert Blain reports.**_\n\nThe biggest single change to learning and development in recent years is\ndigitisation. This is opening up wide new vistas for learning and development\npractitioners to explore as they provide more fluid, flexible and fun options\nfor the enhancement of their organisation\u2019s employees.\n\nAnother trend that is sweeping L&D is gamification, with inventive developers\ncreating business strategy games catering to specific industries that are\ntranscending the whole concept of gamification.\n\nSectors as diverse as food and beverage (McDonald\u2019s is one eager participant)\nto big finance outfits to legal are getting involved. But more on this later.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which digital learning has grown is exponential,\u201d says Gill\nWhite, director of business at HR and people development body CIPD, when asked\nabout the single biggest change in L&D programmes in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential L&D practitioners take the time to not only understand how to\ncreate great digital assets, but that they take the time to study the\nneuroscience of learning as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital we understand how people actually learn, in order that we can\ncreate great learning that\u2019s \u2018sticky\u2019 and will genuinely transform skills and\nbehaviours.\n\n\u201cFor example, we now know that social engagement while online is imperative\nfor the learning process, so if you have a learning management system (LMS)\nwithout social and collaborative tools, you\u2019re hampering your people\u2019s chance\nto learn effectively.\u201d\n\nElliot Homan, APAC managing director for professional learning provider Avado,\nconcurs, adding it\u2019s essential to reinforce what is being learnt by employees\nso that it sticks.\n\n\u201cMany organisations still use traditional classroom-based learning,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re familiar with the (Hermann) Ebbinghaus (German psychologist)\n\u2018forgetting curve\u2019, then you\u2019ll understand that most people will forget 50% of\nwhat they learn if they don\u2019t put it into practice immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you couple that with the 70:20:10 concept and you see that 70% of our\nlearning comes from job-related experience, then (the best) programmes are\nbased around real-world learnings \u2013 which are interwoven with the audience\u2019s\nroles within the organisation to make sure they take away those key points\nfrom it,\u201d he adds.\n\n> **It\u2019s vital we understand how people actually learn, in order that we can\n> create great learning that\u2019s \u2018sticky\u2019 and will genuinely transform skills\n> and behaviours.**\n\n**Business strategy games**\n\nOne of the biggest buzzwords around learning and development in the workplace\nis \u201cgamification\u201d. Clearly, classroom learning in organisations has largely\ngiven way to more interactive and playful mediums.\n\nGamification is one of the ways that organisations can engage their workforces\n\u2013 from recruitment, to employee engagement, to talent development \u2013 but it\u2019s\nimportant for HR practitioners to identify what gamification is. And isn\u2019t.\n\nAccording to Vince Siu, CEO and founder of business strategy games developer\nPress Start, there are a few misconceptions surrounding gamification.\n\n\u201cThe traditional definition of gamification is to borrow concepts from games\nto spice up a product, service or campaign, which usually takes the form of\nleader boards, badges, points and levels,\u201d he says.\n\nHe believes the definition is too simple and outdated, and that there is much\nmore that can be learned from games.\n\n\u201cIf you create a fun experience at the core, then it\u2019s that much easier to\nbuild educational programmes around it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFun and interactivity beget replayability, and if you have a game-play\nexperience that people want to come back to \u2013 even if it\u2019s designed around the\ndriest theme out there \u2013 then you increase the chance of engagement and\nretention.\u201d\n\nCIPD\u2019s White is also a passionate advocate of the crucial role gaming should\nplay in an organisation\u2019s L&D programme.\n\n\u201cThe brain learns well in gaming environments,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf the environment is stimulating, the amygdala (the part of the brain where\nlearning is thought to happen) is stimulated and if you are enjoying the\nexperience, dopamine is released, which is believed to encourage memory. So,\ngaming is a great environment for learning.\n\n\u201cHowever, the stimuli that makes games enjoyable can also often make them\naddictive \u2013 which we are now seeing more and more in the gaming world \u2013 so\nthere is a note of caution here too.\u201d\n\n> **Fun and interactivity lead to replayability, and if you have a game-play\n> experience that people want to come back to then you increase the chance of\n> engagement and retention.**\n\n**Business strategy games**\n\nThe next step in the evolution of L&D could well be business strategy games.\nPress Start is one company already getting in on the act and develops custom-\nbuilt business strategy games across a variety of sectors \u2013 from food and\nbeverages to finance and law. Siu believes this new wave of strategic game\nplaying is a much more effective way to engage employees.\n\n\u201cAt their core, games are a simplified version of a complex reality, condensed\ninto a playable experience via rules and logic. The components chosen, the\nmechanics used, the experience curated \u2013 these all reflect what elements are\nseen as important to a specific world, and how that world is perceived to\nwork,\u201d he explains.\n\nBy way of example, Press Start designed a card game focusing on fashion buying\nfor PolyU (the Hong Kong Polytechnic University) to use in its fashion\nbusiness programme.\n\n\u201cAt its core, it was a simulation of the actual fashion buying industry, and\nfrom many interviews with industry experts and practitioners we were able to\nget a sense of how it works on the whole \u2013 inventory management, budget\ncontrol, trend forecasting, VIP curation, the works \u2013 but condensing it all\ninto simple, playable rules was the main challenge,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe first tested it in a recruitment drive for its undergraduate programme,\nand it worked like a charm because it was quick to learn, fun to play, and\nmost importantly, simple, yet reflective of reality.\u201d\n\nThe reference to recruitment is interesting. Siu points out that this games\ntemplate can also be effectively deployed when hiring employees.\n\nPress Start also had a successful engagement with fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s\nlarge-scale McTalent recruitment drive, by customising a game based around an\n\u201centrepreneurship game and a role-playing adventure\u201d for candidates, with\noutstanding results.\n\n**EQ is the new IQ**\n\nAnother way that L&D is evolving is the trend towards soft skills. Emotional\nintelligence (EQ) is becoming a sought-after attribute and learning skills in\nareas such as conflict resolution with colleagues and customers alike, is a\nvaluable asset.\n\nAlthough, according to CIPD\u2019s White, the need to build soft skills through L&D\ndepends on specific scenarios.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what the learning outcomes are,\u201d White says.\n\n\u201cThere are compliance requirements that are quite simply \u2018black and white\u2019 in\nthe outcomes they need from the learner. But certainly, the more engaging,\nsocial and exciting learning is, the greater the chance for it to sink in and\ndrive genuine behavioural and skills changes.\u201d\n\nWhite cites David Rock\u2019s, _The Science of Making Learning Stick_ , as a great\nexample of some of the many new theories on putting together a great learning\nprogramme.\n\nWhile L&D is a standalone aspect of human resources management, it also\ntraverses all aspects of HR \u2013 from recruitment through to diversity and\nconclusion.\n\nAccording to Alisha Fernando, APAC head of diversity and inclusion at\nBloomberg, and featured in this issue\u2019s cover story: \u201cDiversity and inclusion\nneeds to be embedded into everything a business does, not just learning and\ndevelopment. But L&D, I think, plays a key role in shifting the dial.\n\n\u201cSo when we talk about D&I for an organisation, we\u2019re talking about doing\nthings differently. We\u2019re talking about shaping a new world where we haven\u2019t\nbeen before and the way that we do that is to continually develop our people \u2013\nand we do that through L&D.\u201d\n\nWhatever aspect of HR that L&D encompasses, one thing is clear: for the best\noutcomes, it should fire the imagination of those participating and be\nrelevant to your workplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2013 who doesn\u2019t like to have fun! in an era where experience is\nking, having that experience be fun, interactive and replayable makes it\nmemorable and engaging,\u201d concludes Siu from Press Start.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

In another recent survey, an average of 43 percent of\n[young](https://www.oecd-forum.org/users/264950-nick-\nchambers/posts/53006-young-people-don-t-feel-ready-for-the-future-of-work\n\"OECD\") people said that they were confident that they will need to retrain\nand have the ability to do so.\n\nAs revealed in the Future of Jobs Report 2018 released by the World Economic\nForum, ubiquitous high-speed mobile Internet, artificial intelligence,\nwidespread adoption of big data analytics, and cloud technology are only some\nof the drivers of change that could lead to demand for new skills and create\nthe need for continuous learning for entire workforce, irrespective of their\nindustry or domain.\n\nAs uncertain as it could get, the entire world of work has taken a hit with\n[COVID-19](https://www.peoplematters.in/tag/covid-19?utm_content=covid-19\n\"People Matters\") pandemic. Businesses across many sectors have been urged to\nnow operate remotely and quickly adapt to the new ways of working. The role of\nleaders has become most critical, they have to help the organizations and the\nentire workforce navigate through this uncertainty looming around the whole\necosystem.\n\nTo be able to navigate the complexities of the business ecosystem at present\nand in the future, as it gets more uncertain, leaders of today and tomorrow\nhave to follow the mantra of \u2018Learn, Unlearn & Relearn\u2019.\n\n### The need to learn, unlearn & relearn\n\nThe metaphor, \u2018Change is the only constant\u2019, is as real as it could get in the\nera of industry 4.0. The onus thus, comes on the business and HR leaders to\ninvest in continuous development of their workforce and ensure that they are\nalways up to date with the in-demand skills.\n\nAnurag Bansal, Senior Director and Business Head, [HUGHES Global\nEducation](https://www.hugheseducation.com/ \"HUGHES Global Education\") shared,\n\u201cIn recent times, businesses across the globe are increasingly facing complex\nproblems due to rapid changes in technology, disruptions happening through\ninnovation, turbulent market conditions and changing consumer behavior. During\nsuch uncertainty, especially, given the complexities COVID-19 pandemic has led\nto, it is very important to have leaders at the helm who can steer their\ncompanies to success in these scenarios.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that there is a need to create agile business models,\ncollaborative needs across disciplines, and the push to drive greater\nefficiency with limited resources have become critically important for the\nbusinesses. Therefore, it's essential for leaders to strategically think and\nhave required management skills to continue driving innovation to help their\norganization be ahead of the curve.\n\nBansal has further suggested some critical management skills organizations and\nthe workforce must focus on:\n\n  * Strategic Thinking\n  * People Management\n  * Leadership\n  * Business Analytics \n  * Digital Transformation\n  * Design Thinking\n  * Business Management \n\nSome of the critical technical or functional skills depending upon their area\nof work can be:\n\n  * Business Analytics\n  * Digital Marketing\n  * Supply Chain Management\n  * Sales and Marketing\n  * Blockchain\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Mobile Applications\n  * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n### India Inc realizes the need for skilling\n\nPaneesh Rao, Chief People Officer, Mindtree shared with People Matters,\n\u201cTechnology is ever-evolving and therefore, it is imperative for a progressive\norganization like ours to up skill and reskill the talent pyramid to cater to\nthe changing paradigm.\u201d\n\nHe added that reskilling as a necessity gets further manifested by the lack of\navailable lateral talent which is fully equipped with the necessary skills\nkeeping pace with the emerging technologies. For example, there are 10\npositions and one candidate for each of the new technologies. In the future,\nit will be a combination of hiring one candidate externally and creating 10\nwithin the company.\n\nIn an interaction with People Matters, Satyanarayanan Visvanathan, Senior Vice\nPresident, Head of HR (Global) and Head of Corporate Quality, CSS Corp\nreiterated the same thought about the need to skill, upskill and reskill. He\nsaid, \u201cI believe in the collective wisdom of continuous learning to ensure the\nlong-term sustainable growth of the organization.\u201d\n\nBesides automation and technological disruption, it is also the newer working\nmodels like gig economy, remote working and other aspects like increased\ngenerational diversity, among others that the leaders of tomorrow need to\nprepare for.\n\nAvesh Kumar Jha, SVP \u2013 OD & PM, Hinduja Global Solutions shared with us,\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re dealing with a workforce that constitutes five generations,\nright from recent college graduates stepping into professional spheres to\nindustry veterans. Can they be handled in one single fashion? No. They each\nhave different needs and gauging this is a skill that should be acquired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important for employees to make themselves and their team members\nrelevant to the time we\u2019re in by upskilling and reskilling continuously,\u201d Jha\naffirmed.\n\nHe further added that as the workplace narrative has changed with employees\noperating from home, remote locations, in-premise, etc., leaders need to have\nthe competencies to engage and grow them and grow with them.\n\nTo be able to maximize the opportunities the new world of work brings in\nleaders have to learn the new, unlearn the irrelevant, and relearn, for the\nlearning shall continue.\n\n### How can organizations create future-ready leaders?\n\nBansal suggests, \u201cThe first task of talent leaders is to identify which skills\nare required for which employee depending upon their current work as well as\nfuture roles and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThey need to divide employees in two categories of skill development,\nTechnical Skills and Management skills. Those employees who are individual\ncontributors, their technical skills must be developed and for people in\nsupervisory roles or leadership roles, the focus must be on management skills.\n\nHe advises that while choosing a program for skill enhancement, it is\nessential to focus on learning outcomes otherwise the whole purpose of the\ndevelopment will fail.\n\n\u201cSo, choose development programs that have live online interaction and\nrigorous assessments and not once with recorded online lectures as part of the\ntraining just as a means to save budgets,\u201d said Bansal.\n\nOrganizations, especially business leaders and HR teams have had learning and\ndevelopment on their agenda for a long time now. But its importance has only\nincreased with time. As the entire world of work acknowledges the need to\ncontinuously invest in skilling themselves and others to be prepared, it is\nalso essential to reflect on how this culture of continuous learning could be\ndriven in practice.\n\nFrom classroom training for behavioral skills to e-learning to specialized\nexecutive leadership developments and certifications for functional skills,\nthere are many ways in which organizations today can help the employees build\nthe current in demand skills and the skills identified for the future of work.\n\n**Personalized learning**\n\n\u201cAt Mindtree, we believe in personalized learning - each person should be\nlearning what is relevant to them based on their technology domain, their\nproject and their aspirations. While the credit system ensures that learning\nhappens on a continuous basis, learners are free to learn what they choose as\nper their career and work needs,\u201d shared Rao.\n\nLeveraging technology, Mindtree has a course recommendation engine integrated\non Yorbit, a digital learning platform which generates personalized course\nrecommendations for all learners. It considers the past learnings of employees\nand core skills and generates a list of courses that would be ideal for them\nto take up next. In addition to courses, Yorbit also recommends paths &\npackages. It also has mapped out \u2018learning paths\u2019 which enable a learner to\nlearn as per their career and work goals. These paths are created by bundling\ntogether various courses into a \u2018package\u2019, which allows a learner to find and\ncomplete all relevant courses in one place.\n\n**Matching the speed of change**\n\nCSS Corp, for instance, matches the speed of skilling to the change in\ntechnology through its Digital Reskilling Framework, and grooms budding\nleaders through leadership development programs and mentor-mentee sessions.\n\n\u201cIn a dynamic and fast-paced workplace, we expect leaders to visualize future\nscenarios, be digitally savvy, and provide technological interventions without\nlosing sight of the human aspect of interactions. A sense of sensitivity or\nhuman touch during interactions is of primary importance. It\u2019s a blend of all\nof these skills and traits. Our flagship skilling ecosystem equips our\nworkforce and leadership to stay at the forefront of the industry,\u201d shared\nVisvanathan.\n\n**Learning in the flow of work**\n\nRandstad has taken another interesting approach to create a future-ready\nworkforce. Anjali Raghuvanshi, CPO, Randstad India shared how the company has\nglobally created an experimentative culture for its employees to thrive. She\nshared, \u201cWe encourage people to challenge their status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cExperiment. Make your hands dirty. Learn something out of it. The focus is\nless on outcome and more on learning,\u201d added Raghuvanshi.\n\nBesides giving employees the opportunities to experiment, Randstad India also\nhas invested in leadership development programs, for instance, \u2018Leading\ntransformation in the digital age\u2019, a virtual learning program to help its\nworkforce across hierarchies to be digital-ready. It helps them focus on\nlearning aspects like strategic planning, strategic execution and people and\nstrategy. The program in itself is designed to challenge the thought process\nof the learner and look beyond the comfort zone.\n\nRealizing the huge demand for new ways of learning, [HUGHES Global\nEducation](https://www.hugheseducation.com/ \"HUGHES Global Education\") has\nintegrated the strengths of traditional methods of executive education in\nIndia with the latest technology, i.e. real-time Interactive Onsite Learning\n(IOL). With the help of new-age technology it created an ideal environment for\nemployees\u2019 learning experience.\n\nNo matter how much we progress as an organization and people, learning will\nremain an integral part and the journey must continue.\n\n_**\u201cThe illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and\nwrite, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\u201d**_\n\n_**\u2015 Alvin Toffler**_\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning & Development](/category/compensation-\nperformance/training-development?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=training-\ndevelopment \"Browse more in: Learning &amp; Development\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

Billion-dollar retraining programs and on-site corporate\ncolleges have become a reality. In a 2018 McKinsey survey, 62% of executives\nsaid they will need to retrain or replace more than a quarter of their\nworkforce before 2023.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBusiness model disruptions, demographic shifts, and automation of rote tasks\nare putting more pressure on individuals to learn, and on employers to give\npeople the right skills at the right time.\n\nThere is reason for optimism. As we cover in our [HR Trends 2020\nreport](https://hello.visier.com/hr-trends-2020-ebook/), there have been many\nadvances in learning technology. Learning content is more plentiful, cheap,\nand accessible with the rise of massive open online courses.\n\nMany organizations have also experimented with providing a personalized\n\u201cNetflix learning experience\u201d for employees, leveraging Learning Experience\nPlatform (LXPs), micro-learning systems, and adaptive learning systems.\n\n**Reskilling: Nobody is Immune**\n\nEven with a willingness to explore new avenues, many challenges remain for\nlearning leaders. While employee skills data has become more accessible, few\norganizations have mastered the art of skills data maintenance. L&D;\ndepartments often use the LMS to measure learning effectiveness, which does\nlittle to determine whether learning investments are contributing to business\ngoals.\n\nBusinesses must find ways to overcome these challenges because reskilling\ndemands will only intensify as the pace of change continues to accelerate.\nLearning will no longer be a periodic one-and-done process, but a seamless\npart of work for everyone. Critical manager skill sets will also change\nbecause span of control will be broader with the rise of automation. Nobody\nwill be immune from reskilling demands.\n\nOver the next decade, organizations will proactively:\n\n  * Hone in on learning\u2019s business impact. The availability of tools on the market that facilitate \u201cin-the-moment\u201d learning will continue to increase, but HR leaders will still be under pressure to determine whether the business is getting the ROI it needs from learning initiatives. More learning leaders will turn to a unified analytics platform that connects learning to all aspects of the employee lifecycle to business data, which will enable the C-suite to instantly see the impact of learning programs on business results. \n\n  * Evaluate immersive learning solutions. Exciting advances in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have provided organizations with a promising way to give hands-on training for scenarios that are either dangerous or difficult to replicate in the real world. Only a few visionaries have adopted VR/AR for corporate learning programs; Gartner predicts [that mainstream adoption is up to 10 years away](https://hello.visier.com/gartner-hype-cycle-human-capital-management-hcm/). In the nearer future, organizations will start to evaluate immersive learning solutions to determine whether they provide substantial business value.\n\n  * Tackle the skills data challenge. Getting up-to-date information about skills is challenging at best, if not impossible. Employees typically only update their skills profile when they are looking for work (and even then, they are making the updates on LinkedIn or to their resumes\u2013not the company skills repository). Finding ways to keep skills data current and readily available will continue to be a challenge. However, with improvements in AI and machine-learning techniques, along with new nudge engine tools, technology leaders will come up with solutions to this problem. \n\n  \n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\nIf L&D; falls under your area of responsibility at your organization, now is\nthe time to get into the driver\u2019s seat. Follow these tips to future-proof your\nbusiness with strategic learning initiatives--and elevate your own role within\nthe organization:\n\n  * Forecast the new wave of jobs and identify their corresponding skills. \n\n    * Connect with senior business leaders and line managers to determine which skills will be in demand. This process will have to be constant and flexible, as skills needs will likely change every 5-10 years.\n\n  * Determine how much of a learning investment is required to meet business goals using the time to productivity metric. \n\n    * Time to productivity is very important because it is an indicator of how much investment is required to reach your business goals. To get this metric, calculate the sum of days to productivity for the analysis group and divide that by the number of employees in the analysis group. The more aggressively you need to shorten time to productivity, the higher the learning investment.\n\n  * Monitor courses and compare learning outcomes so that they can drive the best business results \n\n    * Dig into your people data to determine whether participants from a specific reskilling program are experiencing more internal movement, flowing from low-demand to high-demand positions.\n\n  \n**Learn More:[How to Engage Generation Z in Workplace Learning &\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nto-engage-generation-z-in-workplace-learning-development/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+in+2020%3A+Reskilling+Goes+Into+Overdrive\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+in+2020%3A+Reskilling+Goes+Into+Overdrive&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR in 2020: Reskilling Goes Into\nOverdrive&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

source LMS trend, led by industry pioneers such as Moodle, has\ndominated e-learning in the last few years. However, many organizations still\nswear by proprietary LMS and its advantages over open source LMS. We assess\nthese two options and look at the factors you should consider before making a\ndecision._**\n\nOn the surface, open source Learn Management Systems (LMS) can appear to be an\nattractive value proposition, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\n(SMBs). You can get started with zero upfront costs, scale as necessary,\ncustomize as required, and easily transfer content without any vendor lock-in.\nHowever, open source LMS comes with a few critical disadvantages which are\noften swept under the rug \u2013 hosting is still done on-premise/cloud which means\nyou are spending heavily on storage. Also, open source LMS assumes a level of\ntechnical know-how which may be missing in your organization. **Learn more:**\n**[What is a Learning Management System\n(LMS)?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/)**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nSo, is it better to invest in a proprietary LMS which promises long term\nsupport and quick implementation? Or, is a cost-optimized, customizable open\nsource LMS the best-fit for you? Today, we discuss these questions in greater\ndetail so you could take the right call.\n\n## What is an Open Source LMS?\n\nThe simplest example of open source versus proprietary environments is that of\nAndroid and Apple. The Android environment lets you configure your own\napplication and you are free to run any compatible software (with an APK\nextension). Apple, on the other hand, requires developers to get their\napplication ratified, ensure that strict guidelines are met, and make software\navailable on a marketplace controlled by Apple, before deploying.\n\nOpen source LMS works in the same way: there are popular open source LMS tools\nout there such as Moodle, which give you all the features to be programmed and\nimplemented as per requirement. [Proprietary\nLMS](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/learning-\nmanagement-systems-to-look-out-for/) requires zero technical efforts and\nincludes support throughout the software\u2019s lifecycle. Of course, there is a\ncost component involved.\n\n## Three Benefits of an Open Source LMS\n\nIf you are considering an open source LMS for your organization, keep in mind\nthese possible benefits:\n\n  1. Highly customizable - Courses can be designed as per the unique objectives of your company, even according to specific quarterly targets or departmental needs. From navigation to UI, it is entirely in your hands, and you have full control over the content without being apprehensive about underlying features being changed/discontinued.  \n\n  2. Completely secure - In the post GDPR world, data privacy is a major concern for every organization, particularly those dealing with customer data. An open source LMS means that the hosted information never crosses enterprise borders, customer information can be ported into the platform to help learners, and compliance is maintained as per organizational policies.  \n\n  3. Timely updates - A proprietary LMS vendor will follow their own update schedule, and this may not be in sync with your requirements. Typically, you are left requesting a feature, following change logs, and waiting for the implementation to arrive. With open source LMS on the other hand, you can prioritize development activities and keep the platform running in alignment with your business targets.\n\n  \nDespite these benefits, however, several organizations swear by their favorite\nproprietary LMS solutions \u2013 here\u2019s why.\n\nLearn more: [Choosing an LMS \u2013 Cloud or\nHosted?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/choosing-an-lms-cloud-or-hosted/)\n\n## The Hidden Costs of Open Source LMS\n\nOpen source LMS doesn\u2019t always imply \u201cfree of cost\u201d. You will have to allocate\nfunds and efforts towards setting up the platform, arranging storage areas\n(server hardware or rented cloud), and keeping IT personnel in place to run\nthe system. Also, leading open source LMS options like Moodle offer at least\ntwo stable upgrades every year, calling for an additional round of\ndevelopment.\n\nBefore taking the plunge and deciding to adopt open source LMS (and going to\nall the trouble of transferring your precious content), keep these factors in\nmind. If the benefits outweigh the costs, there are a few highly acclaimed\nopen source LMS options available \u2013 including Moodle.\n\n## The Bottomline \u2013 Is Open Source LMS for you?\n\nAt the end of the day, the decision comes down to your organizational priority\nand workforce composition. If technical expertise is present in-house then\nchoosing open source LMS makes a lot of sense, containing costs, pushing\nadaptability, and unlocking new ways to innovate for your e-learning\ninitiatives. On the other hand, without the requisite technical talent,\npartnering with an open source LMS expert is just an additional (and often\npreventable overhead).

to just-published findings, the most in-demand HR roles for 2020 in\nHong Kong will be in business partnering, learning & development, employee\nengagement and compensation & benefits.\n\nA total of 45% of HR professionals in Hong Kong will be looking to change jobs\nin 2020 \u2013 while 64% expect to remain in a role for 3-5 years.\n\nThese are the key takeaways from a comprehensive report by Robert Walters that\nanalyses salaries across all sectors, while taking the pulse of all countries\nacross the region.\n\nScroll down for the full 2020 salary guide for Hong Kong HR professionals.\n\nThe report also revealed that the top four motivating factors for HR\nprofessionals are better C&B (73%), better company culture (48%), career\nprogression (45%) and improved work-life balance (38%).\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122406/HR-salary-guide_HK.png)\n\n\u201cHR business partners with previous transformation experience and employer\nbranding expertise are expected to be in high demand for talent attraction and\nretention,\u201d said Ricky Mui, managing director for Robert Walters, Hong Kong.\n\nOffering advice on recruitment trends for next year, Mui added: \u201cWith niche\nskills in short supply and candidates cautious about moving roles in 2020,\nhiring managers need to be decisive about the attributes they are looking for,\nensuring an efficient and well-communicated hiring process.\n\n\u201cIn a period where salary budgets are tight, companies need to demonstrate to\ncandidates, the presence of a positive workplace culture where flexible\nworking, workspace design and digital technology all play an important role.\u201d\n\nIn terms of Hong Kong\u2019s top HR earners for 2020, HR directors in a permanent\nrole in the finance sector boasted the biggest annual salary, with an expected\nrange of HK$1.2\u20131.8 million \u2013 this is up from 2019\u2019s top end figure of HK$1.6\nmillion.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122507/HR-key-findings_HK-700x410.png)\n\n\n\n**Also read: [HR

somewhat different. A total of 81% of HR\nprofessionals expect to stay in a role for 3-5 years (higher than Hong Kong),\nwhile 38% of mainland HR professionals did not feel optimistic about job\nopportunities in the sector.\n\nThe most in-demand roles in China in 2020 are tipped to be business\npartnering, change management, talent acquisition and retention & development.\n\nIn terms of the biggest earners, mainland China has gazumped Hong Kong with a\nHR director in Shanghai predicted to earn an annual salary of up to 1.8\nmillion RMB, while a HR director in Beijing will be able to earn up to an\nenviable 3.0 million RMB annually.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122537/HR-salary-guide_Shanghai.png)\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122606/HR-salary-guide_Beijing-700x406.png)\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Though the concept of learning management\nsystems is not new; it is evolving as every other technology is.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWe see that the market is predicted to grow from $5.22 billion in 2016 to\n$15.72 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 24.7%, according to a report by Markets\nand Markets. This indicates the state of flux that the LMS market is going\nthrough. A plethora of latest technologies is being applied to learning and\ndevelopment to make learning more personalized, always-on, and engaging for\nthe learner. Employees today are not happy with the occasional classroom\ntraining; they want an anytime-anywhere learning experience and one that is\ncurated to their unique needs. No wonder, the task of choosing an LMS has now\nbecome more complex than ever, what with innumerable options to choose from\nand ever-increasing employee needs. Here is what every L&D; or HR professional\nmust ask themselves and the vendors to make the right selection:\n\n1\\. **Self-Hosted or Software-as-a-Service** : This is often the first\ndecision that any L&D; professional choosing an LMS needs to take\u2014to either\ncreate an in-house system or to outsource it all as a SaaS application. Both\nhave their advantages and disadvantages. An in-house system can be developed\nright from scratch, giving you better control and the freedom to customize as\nper your needs. However, it requires significantly more time to develop and\ndeploy, and more resources to carry out ongoing maintenance and support. You\nmay need to hire LMS experts (administrators or facilitators) just to manage\nelements such as content, deployment, technical troubleshooting, etc. On the\nother hand, a SaaS application removes the headache of managing the LMS.\nHowever, you will need to consider the monthly costs that you will be paying\nthe vendor. Also, a third party SaaS application means dependence on external\nagencies, and therein, a loss of control and customization to some extent.\n\n2\\. **Training mix** : It is important to know beforehand what training\nchannels you plan to implement\u2014classroom training management, e-learning,\nmobile learning, MOOC, live event management and so on. The market is flooded\nwith all possible permutations and combinations, which meet different needs,\nand prices vary greatly depending on the number and type of training\ninterventions an LMS can support. You must consider this not only for the\npresent, but also for the future, when learning needs and medium may upgrade.\n\n3\\. **Starting from scratch** : Most organizations already have some form of\ntraining software in place. The moot question is whether to have the new LMS\nimplemented from scratch or to integrate with existing systems. Lack of\nintegration is often the single biggest hindrance to smooth functioning,\nresulting in lack of adoption of new LMS, by employees. If integrating, make\nsure smooth integration processes are set up at the outset to prevent any\nglitches later on. An interrupted learning experience can put off a learner\nforever, and make the overall LMS implementation project a hit-and-miss.\n\nChoosing an LMS is often a choice between the amount of rigidity and control\none wishes to give employees. Today\u2019s employees wish to learn as per their\nconvenience, which means logging into a bite-sized learning module for 15\nminutes on the way to work. Over and above the aforementioned basics, one must\nnot forget to enable features such as cross-device compatibility, round-the-\nclock access, and engaging content such as games and simulations.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-to-choose-a-learning-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Choose+a+Learning+Management+System\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Choose+a+Learning+Management+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-to-choose-a-learning-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-to-choose-a-learning-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-to-choose-a-learning-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Choose a Learning Management\nSystem&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-to-choose-a-learning-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

gamification doesn\u2019t mean installing PlayStations all across the\nworkplace. It means using your online training software or any other eLearning\ntool to stimulate training by converting work activity into a more game-like\nexperience.\n\nBut, why should you?\n\nBecause gamification boosts employee engagement by making training, and other\nregular tasks, more exciting and appealing.\n\nGamification taps into the same human motivations which make 'games'\nentertaining to incentivize trainees, creating a more proficient learning and\ntraining model.\n\nWhether you\u2019re using your LMS for employee training or any other kind of\ntraining, applying gamification will increase employee engagement and\nknowledge retention.\n\nHere are some stats to back that up:\n\n[Eighty-three percent](https://www.talentlms.com/blog/gamification-survey-\nresults/) of employees who receive gamified training feel driven, whereas 61%\nof those who receive non-gamified training feel uninterested and uncreative.\n\nUp to 7-times conversion rate has been attained by businesses using\ngamification.\n\n[Eighty\npercent](https://www.elearninglearning.com/gamification/statistics/?open-\narticle-id=10681320&article-title=benefits-of-gamification-in-training&blog-\ndomain=paradisosolutions.com&blog-title=paradiso) of employees in the US\nbelieve game-based learning is more appealing.\n\n[Seventy-eight percent](https://www.digitalchalk.com/resources/blog/tips-and-\ntricks/8-surprising-gamification-statistics) of employees believe that\ngamification in the [hiring process](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/make-\ngood-hires/) would make a corporation more desirable.\n\nCorporate gamification training features increase by 60% the level of employee\nengagement and improve efficiency by up to 50%.\n\n## Benefits of gamification in employee engagement & training\n\nWondering how incorporating gamification into your online learning software\ncan improve employee training?\n\nHere are eight key benefits of using gamification in LMS training.\n\n### 1\\. Employee Feedback\n\nBy means of gamification, your employees can receive constant, updated, and\nautomatic feedback. You can include different leaderboards in your online\ntraining software so that workers can observe how they\u2019re doing compared to\nyardsticks they\u2019ve set for themselves. They can even compare their performance\nto their fellow workers within the company.\n\nUndoubtedly, feedback is one of the most significant features of gameful\ndesign, as it allows learners to continuously comprehend how they\u2019re doing and\nwhat measures they can take to enhance their performance.\n\n### 2\\. Employee Recognition\n\nNearly 58% of workers believe employee recognition is how managers could do\nmore to increase employee engagement. This clearly shows that, like financial\nrewards, recognition at work is equally important.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want to feel acknowledged and appreciated? We all want to know\nthat we\u2019re doing a great job, and that our hard work is being accepted by our\nbosses.\n\nGameful training is an effective way to observe which employee is performing\nparticularly well, which one has improved drastically, and which employee may\nhave wafted off and might need a slight warning.\n\nThe best part is that it's all carried out automatically, making it stress-\nfree for supervisors to manage.\n\n### 3\\. Skill Development and Improvement\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of adding gamification elements to your online\ntraining software is to provide ample opportunities to your employees for\nlearning and self-improvement.\n\nThe feeling of learning a particular skill is a significant aspect of\naccomplishment and happiness in the office.\n\nA gameful training design allows you to discover new things, and see how\nthey\u2019re becoming easier and easier with the passage of time. And before you\neven realize, something that used to be exceptionally challenging could be\ndone more effortlessly.\n\n### 4\\. Motivation and Encouragement\n\nTo compete and to succeed are innately  human characteristics. We all want to\nwin and surpass others, don\u2019t we?\n\nBy converting boring courses into gamified sessions, you can encourage\nemployees to compete with one another.\n\nThis way, they feel more motivated to participate in training and give their\nhundred percent to appear on the top spot of the leader board.\n\n### 5\\. Employee Engagement\n\nGamification is a potent engagement tool that produces actual behavior\nvariation by working with your brain chemistry.\n\nGamified training feels awe-inspiring as it activates a strong gush of happy\nhormones. It makes your brain say, \u201cWhatever you just did, keep doing it!\u201d\n\nSo when your employees enjoy learning, they feel involved and desire more.\nBut, when learning is uninteresting, the happy aspect disappears.\n\nThis means you can use gamification to put the happiness back into your online\nlearning initiatives.\n\n### 6\\. Autonomy and Self-paced Learning\n\nUnlike customary class-based training programs, gamified learning provides\nyour employees with the option of selecting their own schedule to start a\ntraining course or module.\n\nAll thanks to technological developments, your employees can access training\ncontent from any part of the world, via any device, and at any time they want.\n\n### 7\\. Emotional Resilience\n\nDid you know, gamification can change your emotional responses and [improve\nresilience](https://shiftdesign.org/content/uploads/2016/09/BfB_RCT.pdf)?\n\nBut, why is emotional resilience important? Because it\u2019s strongly related to\nengagement in the workplace.\n\nBy incorporating a gamified training program, you can increase your employees\u2019\nresilience and poise. If they know there\u2019s a prize or the opportunity to level\nup at the end of a challenging learning task, they\u2019ll be more determined to do\nwell.\n\nRather than feeling frustrated when confronted with a difficult subject,\nthey\u2019ll rise and shine through the challenge.\n\n### 8\\. Teamwork and Shared Success\n\nOnly a few things activate that heartfelt, fuzzy sentiment more than rejoicing\nsuccess together. No matter how distant your teams are, gamified training\nallows them to rejoice their co-workers\u2019 accomplishments on the online\ntraining software.\n\nComputer-generated prizes such as badges and points appear on every user\u2019s\nprofile area and turn up on the newsfeed of their online learning software. So\nevery time somebody attains an Acclaim Badge or Experience Points, their co-\nworkers can applaud them with virtual claps or a thumbs up!\n\nPlus, you can arrange online tournaments between different departments that\nencourage teamwork among employees, along with fun-filled learning.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that gamification shouldn\u2019t be done just for the\nsake of making training entertaining.\n\nThere should be a definite aim, an objective that you want employees to\nachieve. Without any clear aim, the learning will fail to create an impact,\nwhich means no retention and waste of time, funds and energy.\n\nSetting an aim for learning and gamification will allow your employees to hark\nback to what\u2019s being conveyed. As humans, we\u2018re more likely to recollect\nactions than words. If the aim is unknown, your employees will probably get\nmuddled and lose vision.\n\n And a player who\u2019s muddled can never win the game. Similarly, your employees\nwho are confused between training purposes will fail to gain important\ntakeaways.\n\n![Ehsan Memari, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Ehsan\nMemari, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Ehsan\nMemari, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/ehsanmemari-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Ehsan Memari, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/ememarihrmorning-com/)\n\nEhsan Memari is a blogger for [SkyPrep](https://www.skyprep.com/), a provider\nof leading online training software for organizations to train employees\u2019\npartners and customers.

This $1.3+ billion deal is important to note and brings its own special characteristics. \n\n__\n\n![Image of cornerstone\nlogo](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2020-02/15D5A16B-9BB5-437C-9900-2BB7F1FA4AA1.jpeg?itok=RGduqhHP)\n\nLate last week, Ultimate Software and Kronos announced a merger. This week,\nit\u2019s Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD) and Saba. Before we do the deal review,\nhere\u2019s a prophetic point I made in [last week\u2019s\npiece](https://diginomica.com/ultimate-kronos-merger-marriage-equals):\n\n> I can see why the deal is happening and it augers a new era/wave of\n> consolidation and maturity in cloud HR solutions. I understand the financial\n> underpinnings and synergies for the deal, too.\n\nThat was true for last week\u2019s deal and I believe it will be so for this one,\ntoo. Consolidation definitely is underway in the HCM tech space.\n\n## The deal details\n\nHere\u2019s the quick CSOD/Saba deal review:\n\n  * CSOD will pay $1.395 (USD) billion for Saba\n  * The vast majority of that amount will be financed via CSOD\u2019s cash on hand and short-term debt\n  * Combined, the company should have over 7,000 customers, 75 million users and $818 million in ARR\n  * Both parties will bring a number of large enterprise and mid-market company logos to the deal\n  * Combined, the two companies will deliver approximately $838 million in revenues. Today, it appears CSOD will contribute $577 (i.e., total 2019 revenue) million and Saba would contribute approx. $243 million.\n  * Adam Miller, CEO of CSOD will be CEO of the combined firm. Phil Saunders, CEO of Saba, will become Chief Operating Officer of the combined firm.\n\n## Planned merger benefits\n\nThe new company will go for many of the same synergy benefits that most\nacquirers seek. They\u2019ll pursue economies of scale in back office functions,\ndata center operations, etc.\n\n![Image of Cornerstone OnDemand Saba\nslide](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_full_desktop/public/images/2020-02/11FBF385-A24B-4AEE-8DC8-5D170FF4A265.jpeg?itok=aeQienmx)\n\nWhat the slide above doesn\u2019t show are expansion opportunities for the combined\nfirms. We should expect CSOD to cross-sell Saba solutions into its own\ncustomer base and vice versa. Those sales should occur with substantially less\nsales and marketing expense compared to net-new deals. Those infill/cross-sell\ndeals should help grow margins and aid in rule of 40 target compliance.\n\nCEO Adam Miller told analysts he expects to better leverage the combined\nfirms\u2019 global R&D efforts. He also expects other deal dynamics including:\n\n  * More focused development around Talent Management and Talent Experience\n  * More sales successes with global marquee customers\n\n## The big goal\n\nCEO Miller wants to grow CSOD into \u2018one of the most successful cloud companies\nin the world\u2019. Doing so will take some work.\n\n**First, there are competitors.** CSOD, post-deal, will be a sub-billion-\ndollar (revenue) firm for at least another year or two. It will face larger HR\ntechnology competitors in the $3 billion revenue range. Those vendors include\nWorkday and the newly combined Ultimate/Kronos firm. Even larger competitors,\nlike SAP and Oracle, may eye a larger CSOD more warily. CSOD has maintained a\npeaceful relationship with Workday and other payroll providers for much of its\nexistence. How friendly those providers will be now remains to be seen as the\nnew CSOD will have much broader HCM/HR software footprint and will become a\nmore material global solutions provider, too.\n\n**Second, there are all of those different products, product architectures and\ndata models.** Saba bought Lumesse in 2018, Halogen in 2017 and Human Concepts\nlong before that. CSOD is no stranger to acquisitions either. They acquired\nSonar6 (a personal favorite of mine back then) about 8 years ago. Six years\nago, they acquired Evolv and two years ago, they acquired Workpop and Grovo.\nThe Saba acquisition is, in my estimation, considerably larger than any of\nthese. CEO Miller indicated that Saba was into well into the integration of\nLumesse and that prior acquisition integrations are done. CSOD has, I believe,\nintegrated all of its prior acquisitions. But, integration doesn\u2019t always mean\nthat all products are on the same architecture and share a common data model.\n\nThis will be an important matter as CSOD/Saba will be competing with firms\nlike Workday and Ceridian. Workday makes its single architecture and\narchitectural purity a key selling point (i.e., The Power of One). Ceridian\u2019s\nDayforce products have a similar singular architecture. A collection of\nacquired, but integrated, products generally will not fare as well in a\ncompetitive deal (all other things being equal). CSOD/Saba will nonetheless be\na force to contend with in deals where robust learning, learning content, etc.\nis a key deal driver.\n\n**Third, what happens to CSOD\u2019s partnerships?** For much of its existence,\nCSOD tried to be the Switzerland of software. It stayed neutral. When CSOD was\nmostly a learning solution firm, big HR suite and ERP competitors wanted to\npartner with them. CSOD had learning tech to offer and the competitors had\npayroll & HCM capabilities. Even after CSOD created a fairly complete HCM\nsuite, it still lacked a payroll module and maintained many of those same\npartnerships.\n\nBut CSOD has been growing and will get close to the $1 billion revenue mark\nbefore long. As a bigger firm, with more functionality and global coverage,\ncompetitors may be less inclined to partner with them. It will be interesting\nto see how Adam and the gang manage this.\n\nOn the other end are the partnerships with integrators, resellers, content\nproviders, technology partners, etc. that both firms possess that could become\nreal assets. These relationships can enhance functionality, extend\ncapabilities, make vertical extensions possible, introduce CSOD/Saba into new\naccounts, etc.\n\n## The deal brings additional global opportunities\n\nThe Lumesse part of Saba had a fair bit of EU customers. Saba itself had a lot\nof global accounts, too. CSOD has been implemented in much of the world. Added\ntogether, the new company should be able to better leverage its sales offices,\ndevelopment centers, data centers, etc. in an even more global and productive\nmanner.\n\nThis could be a real positive as more and more companies want a truly global\nsolution. They\u2019re so not interested in solutions that only work in U.S.\nEnglish for companies that are headquartered in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and\nAustralia. Global is so much more than multi-national and it\u2019s what businesses\nwant today.\n\n## Deal trivia\n\n  1. Vector Capital originally got involved with Saba back in 2013 but the relationship deepened in 2015 when Saba was taken private. Now, five years later, Vector may get its liquidity event.\n  2. After Phil Saunders took the helm at Saba, I told him that the culture and customer service ethos of Halogen was a major asset. A year later, he confessed that it was. I hope CSOD can find a way to incorporate some of that post-merger.\n\n## My take\n\nCompared to last week\u2019s Kronos/Ultimate deal, this one\u2019s way more digestible.\nWhile I wrote about all manner of post-merger integration issues in [last\nweek\u2019s piece](https://diginomica.com/ultimate-kronos-merger-marriage-equals),\nmany of the same concerns will apply here, too, although the degree of\ndifficulty may be less.\n\nCSOD/Saba customers will want to watch for announcements from the company over\nthe next few weeks and months. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll hear a lot about product\nroadmaps, product support plans, etc. at Cornerstone\u2019s user conference in a\ncouple of months.\n\nIt\u2019s now fairly safe to say that the era of micro- or mini-HCM suites is\ncoming to an end. Buyers want a single vendor solution, wherever possible, and\nold functional moats are going away. CSOD/Saba is way bigger than before \u2013 now\nit must create a seamless, one UX, one data model, etc. solution to sell.\n\nIs more consolidation in the offing? Well, Ceridian looks like a good target\nfor someone to snap up. And Google or Microsoft (who already owns LinkedIn)\ncould be the next big acquirers in the space. But, in the short-term, I\nsuspect we\u2019ll see a lot more tuck-in deals not large acquisitions.\n\nThis deal will likely trigger additional FUD commentary from Cornerstone\u2019s\ncompetitors \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to hear the spinning that\u2019s to come.\n\nFor more information on Saba and Cornerstone OnDemand see:\n\n  * [Cornerstone unveils

should be in alignment with the employee\u2019s long-term personal\ngoals\u2019\n\nrcnt.eu/3t8fi\n\nSeptember 6, 2019\n\n![Marc Coleman headshot](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/LAD_p06_oped_01-e1567684014947.jpg)BY MARC COLEMAN,\nchief executive, unleashgroup.io\n\nIt was reported earlier this year that around a third of UK businesses make\nabsolutely no investment in learning and development (L&D). It\u2019s a shocking\nstatistic in this day and age. By looking across the market though there are\nlessons to be learnt from big companies and education that could benefit you\nif you\u2019re looking to [develop a plan for your business or\ndepartment.](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/roi-learning-development)\n\n## Companies embracing new approaches to learning\n\nThe last few years have seen an explosion in new approaches to workplace\nlearning, especially at an enterprise level. Gone are the dry days of [dull\ntraining sessions with little to no meaning for most\nworkers](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/learner-centred-approach). Functional\ntraining designed for many aspects of health and safety has moved to digital\nsystems, reducing employee time away from being productive and providing\ncompanies with the ability to track full take-up and delegate understanding of\nthe subject.\n\nMore importantly, companies have started to adopt a programme-focused learning\nmanagement system (LMS) utilised by large education establishments. They are\ncombining them with agile, high-quality training and development to deliver\nbest-in-class experiences that are enriching the lives of the employee. They\noften far exceed the quality and range of learning that a university or\ncollege can offer. These courses and learning programmes are based on real-\nlife needs and strategic objectives of businesses.\n\nSky is one such employer that has rolled out this new L&D approach. The media\ncompany has overhauled its training programme over the last 18 months,\nbecoming more agile and tapping into the current trend for user-centric\nlearning blended with marketing techniques to ensure employee adoption stays\nhigh.\n\nIn terms of LMS, increasingly this is being extended from education to\nemployment, offering a school-to-working-life experience. Having employees\njoining a company that understands a platform on which they can develop their\nskills and record achievements can be compelling.\n\n## Using AI and data to train employees\n\nOf course, the big rush at the moment is to explore artificial intelligence\n(AI) in the context of L&D platforms. It\u2019s enabling more and more companies to\nuse the analytics and insight generated by the user to deliver personalised\nlearning experiences. These can help to progress them with minimal assistance\nand at a scale hitherto unknown. However, the current [application of true AI\nin human resources (HR)](https://www.raconteur.net/digital-transformation/ai-\nhr-pros-cons) is still quite small and we\u2019re at the very earliest stages of\nthe transformation.\n\nKatarina Berg, the chief HR officer of Spotify, who spoke to us as part of\nUNLEASH World in Paris this October, evidences this. Her role is unique in\nbeing someone having access to Spotify\u2019s internal systems for audience\nanalytics and comparing these to those on offer for HR. She has shared with\nUNLEASH how many embryonic systems there actually are within HR.\n\nThe critical aspect of designing an L&D programme is that it should deliver\nvalue for both the employee and the employer. Learning is best taken on board\nwhen it can be put into practice straight away. So within an organisation,\nwhen developing plans, you should be taking stock of what aspects you\u2019ll\nexpect to see the employee picking up, or improving in, straight away. L&D\nprogrammes should be in alignment with the employee\u2019s long-term personal\ngoals.\n\nWell-structured L&D programmes have consistently shown they can drive up\nretention, ratings, revenues and return on investment. If you\u2019re one of the 99\nper cent of small business in the UK, there\u2019s a wealth of organisations that\ncan support you with free L&D for you and your teams. Many councils support\nlocal enterprise with free resources and the Duke of York\u2019s iDEA programme is\none example of an excellent tool for self-initiated learning.\n\nAlso found in

right\ndirection. But given the advanced analytics functions now available on LMS\nplatforms, and the opportunity to integrate other HR data sources while\nmeasuring your learning metrics, this space can be hard to navigate. In this\narticle, we decode how to measure the success of your learning and development\nprograms, and share which four metrics can help with this._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nOften, it can be difficult for HR practitioners to measure if their L&D;\nprograms are working. Unlike marketing or sales, there are fewer numbers to\nreaffirm your program\u2019s efficacy. As a result, you could be investing in\nineffective L&D; tracks \u2013 or struggling to gain buy-in from the C-Suite,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t demonstrate measurable ROI.\n\nThis is why it is so critical to deploy L&D; analytics in parallel with your\nlearning programs. These analytics uncover valuable insights into\nparticipation rates, progress trends, the number of completed certifications,\ndrop-off areas, and missing links in your L&D; framework.\n\nBut unless you know exactly what to look for, it's easy to get lost in the\nlabyrinth of learning metrics, building exhaustive reports that fall short of\nvalue generation.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to first identify your learning and development\ngoals and link back analytics data for valuable insights.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Employee Training Makeover You Can\u2019t Afford to\nSkip**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/the-\nemployee-training-makeover-you-cant-afford-to-skip/)\n\n## **What Does Data Analytics Mean in the Context of L &D;**\n\nAnalytics is the first step towards getting visibility into the metrics you\nwant to measure.\n\nIn the context of L&D;, analytics takes the vast data sets available in your\nLMS and applies a layer of analysis and visualization to highlight key\nmetrics. This could include:\n\n  * Which training sessions have been completed \n  * Which teams have completed a specific\n  * How employees consume different types of L&D; content \n  * Courses that have been taken more than once\n\n  \nIf you\u2019re applying analytics to L&D;, there are few [learning\nmetrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/digital-\nlearning-metrics-you-should-measure/) to watch out for. Of course, this will\nvary according to the nature of your business and its unique requirements. For\nexample, increased positive customer feedback is an excellent indicator of\nlearning effectiveness (and an easy-to-measure metric) if you\u2019re responsible\nfor a contact center.\n\nBut apart from these company-specific nuances, your [L&D; analytics\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/the-top-\nlearning-development-questions-solved-by-analytics/)and measurement model\nshould be centered on four key learning metrics.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/five-key-\nlms-trends-2019/)**\n\n## **Measure these 4 Metrics to Evaluate L &D; Success**\n\nIn addition to standard analytics data such as course completion rates and\npace of competition, there could be other vital areas that are being ignored.\nHere are four learning metrics, as described by Ashish Rangnekar, co-founder\nand CEO of [BenchPrep](http://benchprep.com), an advanced online learning\nprogram for professional education and certification organizations, directly\nlinked to the impact of your L&D; program.\n\n### **1\\. The cold, hard cost of training your employees**\n\n  \nDid you know that per-employee training investment is a clear marker of your\npast program\u2019s efficacy? Organizations often tend to train the same employees\nfor the same skill sets.\n\nUnless your workplace is witnessing sweeping changes, the cost of L&D; per\nemployee should remain stable. It is not advisable to blindly invest simply\nbecause you have detected a skills gap. If you have provided the same training\nbefore, this could mean that the solution isn't working as expected.\n\nMake costs a vital component in your L&D; analytics dashboard, taking stock of\nchanging spending patterns every month, and realigning your L&D; modules\naccordingly.\n\n### **2\\. A rise \u2013 or a dip \u2013 in operational efficiency**\n\n  \nThis holds true specifically for production-oriented or high-volume\nbusinesses. Your learners should be able to handle higher throughput at work,\nmanaging larger volumes within the same time. That's why this learning metric\nis intertwined with [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/).\n\nData gathered from performance management systems will indicate how well a\nlearner can apply their newly acquired skill sets in the workplace.\n\nConversely, if the learning program is ineffective or irrelevant to the\nemployee\u2019s daily work schedule, you could even notice a dip in efficiency\nlevels. The learner is distracted from their workday, redirected to training\nin areas that are not relevant to their role. It is essential to nip such\ninstances in the bud, and promptly channel the employee in a different\ndirection.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is a Learning Management System\n(LMS)?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/)**\n\n### **3\\. Progress for both the company and employee**\n\n  \nL&D; isn\u2019t just meant to benefit your organization. The employee should be\nable to gain a meaningful advantage from undertaking the L&D; course. Look for\nan acceleration in their career progression pathway, movement into cross-\nfunctional roles, and an increase in compensation. HR practitioners often\nignore this aspect of L&D;, considering their job to be over once employees\nhave been certified.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really the case. It\u2019s only when an employee is able to take\ntheir learnings and convert it into a _personal_ value-addition that the\nlearning can be deemed useful.\n\nThe same idea is also applicable at the organizational level. For the dollars\nthat you invest during a particular period in L&D;, you should be able to\nwitness a corresponding jump in revenue.\n\nRemember, this won\u2019t always be in the form of a rising bottom line. Future-\nreadiness, more effortless transformation, and scalability into new areas are\nalso indirect contributors to your revenue.\n\n### **4\\. Your learner\u2019s feedback on the instructor**\n\n  \nAsk your employees to regularly evaluate their instructors as well as the\nsoftware they are using. This learning metric will indicate how satisfied your\nlearners are with the L&D; experience.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that learning in the workplace should be fun and\nengaging \u2013 not just another responsibility on a person\u2019s work schedule. That\u2019s\nwhy methodologies like [gamification in\nlearning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-will-be-the-year-of-gamification-in-corporate-learning/)\nare becoming so popular, reinventing the learning process with clear\nincentives and drivers. Leverage [pulse surveys\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/pulse-surveys-\nvs-annual-surveys-which-is-a-better-measure-of-employee-engagement/)after\nevery L&D; track to understand if such interventions are necessary.\n\n**Learn More:** **[A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)**\n\n## **Getting Started with Learning Metrics \u2013 The Way Forward**\n\nFortunately, most LMS solutions come with built-in analytics to answer common\nquestions around L&D; effectiveness. However, to gain a holistic picture of\nemployee development, you need to integrate L&D; analytics with your broader\nHR data landscape. Performance management, retention/attrition rates,\ncompensation, and employee engagement all have a role to play.\n\nHere\u2019s what we recommend:\n\n  * Take stock of your organizational goals and identify which metrics (learning as well as other areas) are contributing factors.\n  * Integrate your data sources, keeping an eye on [data quality](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/6-questions-you-need-to-ask-about-your-hr-data-quality/).\n  * Apply a visualization layer to create a comprehensive overview.\n  * Realign L&D; as per the learning metrics mentioned above, and review the results using analytics.\n\n  \nL&D; is a critical component when offering employees a refreshed value\nproposition. So, you must ensure that any L&D; program reaches its intended\ngoal without becoming part of the organizational \u201cwhite noise.\u201d\n\nYour best bet to making this happen is to link L&D; with clear learning\nmetrics \u2013 numbers, graphical representations, dashboards, and razor-sharp\ninsights, which leave no room for conjecture or abstraction.\n\nThese metrics are your secret weapon to ensure that L&D; programs are accepted\nand appreciated by both employee and employer.\n\n_Which are the top Learning & Development metrics that you measure at your\ncompany? __Let us know on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

That is, if you choose the right one.\n\nWith hundreds of LMS providers out there, it can be daunting to pick the right\none for your company. With so many different factors at play, it\u2019s important\nto understand your company\u2019s needs before jumping into the process.\n\n# How to choose an LMS\n\nChoosing an [LMS](https://www.goskills.com/Blog/What-is-an-LMS) isn\u2019t as easy\nas picking the most feature rich solution out there. In fact, doing just that\ncan backfire on you. A system that\u2019s too complex can alienate admins and\nlearners that aren\u2019t digital natives. Conversely, a system that\u2019s too\nsimplified will hinder course creators and learning admins from living up to\ntheir full potential.\n\nAside from the features, there are a number of other factors you will need to\nconsider when making your decision. In this article, we will go through the\nsteps you can take to make an informed decision.\n\n## Spell out your training needs\n\nSelecting a system is akin to Goldilocks\u2019 dilemma. There isn\u2019t a one size fits\nall solution and in order to find the perfect fit you will first need to\nfigure out what \u201cperfect\u201d means in relation to your company. Mapping out your\ncompany\u2019s training needs is a process done best with collaboration. If you\nhave an existing training solution, speak to admins and a small group of\nlearners to find out what\u2019s lacking.\n\n### Who are you training?\n\nThis might be apparent to you already, but knowing who you\u2019re training is\nessential to determining how you will train and what solution you should use.\n\n#### Age\n\nMeeting people at their digital literacy level is key to improving engagement\nrates. If your company skews older, it would be wise to opt for an LMS with\nlimited features and a friendly UX. A LMS that\u2019s difficult to use can alienate\nlearners who have only recently become digitally literate.\n\nIf there is a millennial majority, you may want to consider a system with\ngamification and social learning elements. An LMS that mimics digital\ninteractions millennials have outside of work makes learning an engaging\nexperience.\n\n#### Size\n\nHow many people do you plan on training? A team, or the entire company? If you\nplan on training a smaller group of people, you might be limited by the\nsolutions you can opt for. A number of learning management systems have\nminimum learner requirements.\n\nIf your company is growing or has a significant turnover rate, you will have\nto consider the different pricing plans as well as the mass user registration\nfeatures.\n\n**Here are some of the pricing plans you will encounter:  **\n\n  * **Pay-per-learner:** ideal if you have a stable number of learners and if training is mandatory\n  * **Pay-per-active-user:** ideal if you have one-time training (e.g. onboarding) or if you\u2019d like to train batches of learners over the year.\n  * **Pay-as-you-go:** ideal if you\u2019re unsure if there will be a stable demand for learning\n  * **License fee:** ideal for large enterprises\n\n#### Skills\n\nIs everyone starting at level one, or are some learners more advanced? If\nyou\u2019re training people with different skill sets, you should look into a\nsystem that lets you segment your audience, create learning paths, or use\nplacement tests.\n\nIf a learner is forced to complete lessons they have already mastered, they\nmay not be as inclined to continue learning, However, this won\u2019t matter if\nyour learners are starting from the same place. So if your objective is\ncompliance training, you won\u2019t have to worry about placement functionality.\nHowever, you will need a solution with a robust tracking system.\n\n### What are your goals?\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve through your learning and development initiatives?\nWhen setting your goals, use the [SMART goals](/smart-goals) format to ensure\nyou\u2019re being specific.\n\nTo refresh your memory, SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable,\nrealistic, and time limited. So instead of \u201cincrease compliance rate\u201d, your\ngoal could be \u201creduce time for certification from three months to two weeks.\u201d\nBreaking down your goals into smaller chunks betters your chance of achieving\nthem.\n\nHelp yourself with a free template to get your SMART goals in check!\n\n[![Ready to set some SMART goals? Download FREE worksheet](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/2ab72641-b175-4378-973b-6036c07b29fe.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/2ab72641-b175-4378-973b-6036c07b29fe)\n\nAs well as setting goals for the immediate future, take into consideration\nyour company\u2019s goals for the next five years. Selecting an LMS that can fulfil\nthe training needs of today and tomorrow will save you time and money in the\nlong run.\n\n### What are your technical requirements?\n\nThe key technical requirements you should be concerned with are content\n(various types), support, user management, learning models, reporting,\nsecurity, and integrations.\n\n#### Content\n\nWhat type of content do you already have? What type of content do you plan on\ncreating in the next few years? Make a list of the file types you need\nsupported (e.g. [SCORM](https://www.goskills.com/Blog/What-is-scorm), PDFs,\nexternal links, audio, video) and another list of nice-to-have supported file\ntypes for the future.\n\nAnother technical content requirement to consider is where the content is\ncoming from. Some LMS have inbuilt content editors that enable admins to\ncreate learning materials from within the platform, or a team that can help\nyou create custom courses from your existing materials.\n\n#### Support\n\nAnother green flag is a robust support service. While you want your solution\nto be intuitive and easy-to-use, you do want to be able to get help when you\nneed it. Once you have shortlisted a few providers, try contacting their\nsupport to ensure their responses meet your standards.\n\n#### User management\n\nAgain, depending on how many people you plan on training, registration will be\na factor you will need to consider. Will learners register themselves or will\nan admin do this?\n\nIf you\u2019re training a large group, look into systems that offer mass\nregistration features such as a CSV upload. If you have high turnover, an\nautomated data feed will cut down on admin workload. Do you have multiple\nadmins working on the LMS? Ensure that the system you pick allows for joint\ncontrol over the system.\n\n#### Learning models\n\nAnother way to narrow down the search is by defining whether your training\nwill be exclusively online, exclusive online, or blended. If your L&D\ninitiatives involve instructor-led training, you will need a platform that\nlets you manage schedules and locations, as well as monitor attendances.\n\n#### Reporting\n\nLearning and development initiatives are all about the results. How do you\nplan on measuring them? Look back to the goals you created in the previous\nstep and note down the metrics you need to collect in order to track their\nprogress.\n\nDo you need the data to be exportable? Are you more interested in group\nmetrics or individual reporting? Do you need the ability to customize reports?\n\n#### Security\n\nSecurity is an important part of eLearning, especially when compliance comes\ninto play. Learners shouldn\u2019t be able to log into each others accounts and\ntheir data should be kept safe.\n\n**Some factors to think about are:**\n\n  * Location of data storage\n  * User authentication\n  * Who can have access to what data\n\nIntegrations\n\nDoes your company use existing Business Intelligence or HR software? If so, is\nit essential that the LMS connects to it? Answering these questions thoroughly\nwill give you clarity when evaluating the different solutions out there. Once\nyou have a definitive list of your requirements, you can start thinking about\nthe extra features you\u2019d like to have.\n\n### What are your nice-to-haves?\n\nAt this point in the LMS search, you can also ask your mini focus group\ncomprised of learners and admins to dream up nice-to-have features. Learning\ntechnology is constantly evolving. Here are just a handful of extra features\nyou may encounter on your search for an LMS:\n\n  * **Social learning:** this can present in a number of forms, but they all involve some social aspect. (e.g. knowledge sharing, competition)\n  * **Talent management:** creation of learning paths to close skill gaps\n  * **Mobile learning:** training is accessible through an app or through an adaptive platform.\n  * **E-commerce:** the ability to sell the courses you create\n  * **White labelling:** makes training feel like a seamless part of the learning experience. Most LMS have basic white labelling features (e.g. logo or theme colours). If you want training to feel even more seamless, you can look into adding the platform to your domain.\n  * **Gamification:** like social learning, this can also take on many forms (e.g. points, rewards, leaderboards) and have a motivating effect on learners\n  * **Certificates:** the ability to upload or create certificates through the platform\n\n## Explore your options\n\nOnce you have a robust idea of your requirements, it\u2019s time to look at your\noptions. You can use sites like G2 to filter by feature in order to come up\nwith a shortlist of LMS to pick from. With so many learning management systems\non the market, this list might be quite long.\n\nOne way to narrow the list down is by asking your peers about their\nexperiences with learning management systems or reading online reviews.\nRemember to take notes while you\u2019re doing this. Evaluating different solutions\nis a long process and the different SaaS may start blending into one. Using an\nExcel sheet to evaluate the different options and keep track of the notes\nmight be tedious, but will help you out down the line.\n\n## Narrow down the list\n\nAfter you\u2019ve come up with a list of options, it\u2019s time to narrow the list down\neven further. You can do this by investigating a vendor\u2019s track record. Have\nthey won awards? How many years have they been in business? Do they have a\nhistory of iterating and advancing their product? How many businesses have\nthey worked with?\n\nAwards, years in business, innovation, and experience are all green flags to\nlook out for. Another thing to look out for is a strong knowledge base \u2013 are\nthere how to articles and video tutorials available?\n\nHow does this vendor handle updates? Will you be informed well in advance?\nWill you need to pay extra to be upgraded? Once you have further downsized\nyour list to 3-5 vendors, it\u2019s time to take the next step.\n\n### Request a demo\n\nBefore you request a demo, refer back to your needs training goals and come up\nwith a list of use cases for the LMS. Additionally, prepare a list of\nquestions to ask the vendor\u2019s representative. Use this time to find out about\nhidden costs, user data protection, customization, or any information you\ncouldn\u2019t find in the research process. Finally, gather the relevant internal\nstakeholders and let the demos commence.\n\n### Try it yourself\n\nThe demos will have given you more clarity when choosing a platform. However,\nthe real test is using the software yourself. Most learning management systems\noffer free trials for a week or a month. Take advantage of this by signing\nyourself up for the shortlisted platforms.\n\nList out possible scenarios and use cases and work your way through the\nplatforms. What does it look like for a learner trying to take a course? What\nhappens when you delete users? How easy is it to download reports? If things\naren\u2019t as easy to use, take this opportunity to contact their support. Is help\navailable right away or do you have to wait?\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulty using the platform, this is not a good sign as it\nwill likely take your colleagues more time to master using the system. After\nall this research, you\u2019re probably an LMS whiz!\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThere is no one size fits all solution. If there was, there wouldn\u2019t be so\nmany learning management systems out there.\n\nWhen choosing an LMS, your objectives need to be clear. The more precisely\ndefined your needs are, the easier it will be to select the right bowl of\nporridge\u2026I mean...LMS. Finally, pick something that can grow with your\ncompany. After all this hard work, the last thing you\u2019re going to want to do\nis repeat the process the following year, or the one after that.\n\n**Now that you know more about[LMS\nsoftware](https://www.g2.com/categories/learning-management-system-lms) than\nyou ever have before, explore all available options for your needs today \u2013\nonly on G2. **\n\n[![Find the best LMS Software on the market.

This edition of\nAI in Learning and Development will provide you with an understanding of the\nkey applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in driving learning and\ntraining initiatives, creating a culture of learning, boosting productivity\nand morale and elevating the employee experience. You will also learn about\nthe key features, use-cases, and questions to ask before investing in an AI-\npowered learning management system.**_\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * _**An Introduction to L&D; Today**_\n  * _**5 Use-cases of AI in L&D;**_\n  * _**Choosing the Right LMS**_\n  * _**Through the Looking Glass: What does the future hold for AI in L&D;?**_\n\n\n\n## **An Introduction to L &D; Today**\n\nBefore we deep dive into the latest trends in the organizational learning and\ndevelopment space, before we take stock of the changes that have been making\nus question and reinvent learning as we know it and before we analyze how to\nchoose the right [learning management system (LMS)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/)for our unique needs, let us acknowledge what\nlies at the heart of every learning process: adaptation.\n\nHow adaptive an organization is today, determines how well it can thrive (and\nnot merely survive) in the years to come. **Going back to the basics, it\nalways helps to remember that learning is a relatively permanent change in\nbehavior that is brought about by experience and maintained through practice.\nThe operational phrase to pay heed to in that definition is \" _relatively_\npermanent\".** It presupposes a certain level of dynamism and fluidity - of\nchange and possibilities. This holds true especially in our present times\nwhere stagnation and complacency have no room given the pace of change!\n\n**Hawley Kane, Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development at\nSaba Software** talked to HRT about the biggest trend to watch out for in L&D;\ntoday and said \"Hands down we see the connection of learning to performance as\nbeing the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here's the crux of it: **For high-performing\norganizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the behavior that drives\nperformance**.\" She clarifies that learning and performance management do not\nmerely co-exist - they are dependent on one another. Thus, to deliver learning\nexperiences that move the needle on performance, talent leaders need to\nempower employees to drive their own development with learning that is aligned\nto individual, team and business goals.\n\nHawley adds, \"By thinking in terms of business outcomes and focusing L&D;\nprograms on specific behaviors, skills, or competencies, you can solidify the\nlearning-performance connection to achieve the results that matter to your\nbusiness.\"\n\nTo talk about L&D; today without mentioning the impact of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), would be a hollow discussion. The\nimpact of technology on learning is crucial since it works in a loop -\nlearning and technology power each other.\n\n## **5 Use Cases of AI in L &D;**\n\nThe evolution of learning and the advancement of technology go hand-in-hand\nand this interdependence demands that we look at the impact of technology on\norganizational learning today, and the [use-cases of AI in L&D; to understand\nhow learning processes have been\ntransformed](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/3-ways-ai-will-transform-learning-and-development/) and improved.\n\n![5 Use Cases of AI in L&D](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nLet's look at the five major use-cases of AI in organizational learning and\ndevelopment.\n\n### **1\\. Deeper, Wider Analytics**\n\n  \nWith AI, L&D; managers can make better sense of the data dump that comes with\nall digital workplaces.  Deep data analysis creates new avenues for\nreassessment and redesign of courses with far greater precision. Data can thus\nbecome more than simply a repository and be looked at as a tool for\ntransformation. AI tools can help access depths of data not explored before\nwhile also enabling the organization to navigate widths that could otherwise\nbe impossible. A recent Gartner report claims that by 2020, AI will create 2.3\nmillion jobs while making1.8 million roles redundant. In an environment as\ncharged with change as that, data cannot be a mere fallback but rather, the\ntreasure of information needs to be the building blocks on which a culture of\ncontinuous change can be built. **AI-powered learning processes could thus be\nmined as the missing link between employee engagement, workforce productivity,\nand business profitability.**\n\n### **2\\. Real-time Artificial Mentoring**\n\n  \nWith AI, learning modules can now be a lot more interactive and powered by\nnatural communication. Conversational bots and engaging interfaces can\ntransform learning by making employees feel a lot more in the loop. AI\nteaching assistants enable trainers in interacting with a wider employee base\nwhile still adhering to each employee individually. Learning Management\nSystems (LMS) can, therefore, be made more responsive and the quality of\nanswers to queries improved. It is thus no wonder that digital tutors that can\nengage with employees in real-time are quackly gaining in popularity.\n**Artificial mentors come with the very real benefits of a much more engaging\nlearning experience.**\n\nRead Full Article __\n\n##### Enter your email address to unlock the full article\n\n__\n\n  I accept the [terms conditions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/terms-of-\nuse/) and [privacy policy](https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n### **3\\. Augmented Content**\n\n  \nWith the format of basic [learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/) processes\nhaving undergone an evolution, the content of learning modules need to change\nas well. While creating content with the aid of subject matter experts is\nessential, it could often be time-consuming. AI tools today are capable of\nbeing trained to skim through tons of information, take out the most relevant\npieces of information and stitch it all together in a format that is human-\nreadable. Immersive, virtual reality (VR) enabled content not only engage\nlearners better but also ensure deeper internalization and more effective\napplication of learned skills and behavior. With fresher content created\nfaster, the shelf-life of learning courses can also be extended and while AI\nstill has a ways to go before being able to organically create and curate more\ncomplicated learning programs, the journey has surely begun.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n### **4\\. Anytime-anywhere Access**\n\n  \nWe live in a world of anytime-anywhere access to information. It is only\nnatural that employees expect the same level of access in learning processes.\nThis not only applies to millennials but to employees at large \u2013 they want to\nbe able to tune into relevant courses on-demand and AI-enabled LMS are making\nthat a reality by being able to track career journeys, map career paths and\npredict learning and skilling needs at each stage of the journey. **In\naddition to individual access, a smart, future-ready LMS system also needs to\ncater to an inherently diverse workforce.** Are the systems available in\ndifferent languages, is the individual context of each employee taken into\nconsideration while tailoring the larger learning programs, how do employees\nwho have visual or auditory constraints interact with and gain from the\ncourses;, and do the L&D; program delivery and outcomes get smarter and better\nover time with AI finding patterns of learning success?\n\n### **5\\. Meaningful Personalization**\n\n  \nAI can help enhance the learning experience by creating personalized content\nand tests that speak to the individual. This goes a lot further than expecting\nyour employees to enjoy a one-size-fits-all training course. From product ads\nthat pop up on our screens to notifications and service suggestions that speak\nspecifically to us, we crave from personalized messages from our environment.\nWith learning too, **AI-enabled platforms that can engage a diverse range of\nemployees are more effective. This allows each employee to be on a meaningful,\npersonalized learning journey while growing collectively.**\n\n## **Choosing the Right LMS**\n\nSelecting the right Learning Management System (LMS) is as crucial to the\nsuccess of the organization as the selection of the right talent. With a\nplethora of options available in a market that is crowded with LMS offerings,\nhow do you ensure that you\u2019re making the right choice? Here\u2019s a step-by-step\nguide for you to keep in mind before taking the plunge. While you may already\nbe aware of these measures that help, it always helps to reiterate these\nthroughout the organization \u2013 especially to the team of L&D; managers who\nwould be taking the decision on selecting a learning management system or the\nupgrades that needs to happen on the one that already exists.\n\n![Choosing the Right LMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n## **Know Your Needs**\n\nBefore you start even window-shopping for an LMS solution, ask yourself:\n\n  1. Who is your target learner audience?\n  2. What are the learning objectives?\n  3. What are the skill-sets that need to be in focus and why?\n  4. What is your end goal (it is not limited to just improving performance)?\n  5. Would the training be imparted individually or simultaneously for the whole team?\n  6. How flexible do the learning modules and the deployment models need to be?\n\n  \nOnce you have the answer to the questions above, you are ready to embark on\nthe journey of finding a new LMS or an upgrade for the existing one. Learning\nobjectives and course logistics are always easier to ascertain before you\nstart weighing options.\n\n## **Know Your Best-Fit**\n\nTo understand what would work best for you, the next stage involves delving\ndeep into technical considerations and limitations. It is not simply about\nputting best practices to use, but rather to acknowledge the need for a best-\nfit learning strategy.\n\n**Dennis Budinich, Chief Culture Officer & SVP, Investors Bank, **shares that\n**\u201c** One of the biggest elements in identifying the right eLearning solution\nis to take the time to understand how people learn. By catering your approach\nto how an employee learns, employees are more likely to adopt these practices\ninto their daily lives. Adoption of these practices leads to behavioral\nchanges. This is something that is often missed by training and development\nleaders.\u201d\n\nHe adds \u201c **By focusing on the fundamental principles that support and enable\npeople to learn, adapt and practice, companies can set themselves up for\neLearning success for their employees.** \u201d\n\nOnce companies learn what principles work best for their employees, they know\nexactly what to look for in an eLearning solution. Focus on how and if the\nsolution moves the needle as opposed to price points, ease of use, etc.\nEmployers should be more interested in how people learn as opposed to how to\ntrain them with adoption and finding the right fit being the primary goal.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Human Resource Development (HRD)? Definition,\nFunctions, and Best Practices for Training\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nhuman-resource-development/)**\n\n## **Know Your Feature Priorities**\n\nWith technology getting upgraded every day, the LMS market is evolving as well\nas are the features that these solutions provide. But what are the features\nthat would work best for your organization? What are your \u201cfeature comforts\u201d?\nThis is where you need to have a must-have, good-to-have and great-to-have\nclassification for your desired features.\n\n**Hawley suggests that for an organization to upgrade to AI-enabled L &D; with\nease, \u201c**Personalized content/recommendations are a critical element of the\nmodern user experience for any application (think Netflix, Spotify, etc.). As\nthe corporate learning market evolves to focus more on the experience that\nmodern users expect, AI and machine learning become even more strategic for\nL&D; teams & leaders.\u201d She adds that **the need is to expand and leverage even\ndeeper people insights to create \u201cjust for me\u201d experiences, conversations and\nconnections that deliver \"one to one\" personal human interactions at a \"one to\nmany\" scale**. This is a key feature to keep in mind when shopping for new LMS\nsoftware. Your choice would also depend on discussion boards or forums,\ntest/assessment capabilities, enhanced security protocols, grading/scoring\nprocesses to track progress, data tracking, and automated user functions like\nnotifications.\n\n## **Know Your Growth Plans**\n\nWith choosing the right features and implementing a new Learning Management\nSystem, you need to know where you are headed as an organization. These are\nnot steps that you are taking just for today. For strategically sound\ndecisions, the scope of amplifying the learning and its application in\naddressing the future needs of the organization need to be kept in mind.\n\n**Skip Marshall, HCM Technology Executive at DXC Technology** lists the three\nmain challenges that organizations face today when it comes to upgrading their\nL&D; frameworks as follows:\n\n**Planning a strategy:** Organizations need to start with business objectives\nin mind.\n\n**Breaking down silos:** All business stakeholders must be vested and believe\nin the solution.\n\n**Undergoing change management:** Change is an inevitable part of business. It\nis important to view the speed of change as an opportunity to transition to\nmore user-friendly, flexible and inclusive learning systems. Obtain and\nachieve key business stakeholder support across business groups, to help drive\nthe solution.\n\nThese points are true especially when it comes to gauging how adaptive your\nchosen AI-enabled LMS will be in the future. Would it help you upgrade to the\nnext big thing after AI or be a deterrent to the next stages of evolution?\nFinding a solution that enhances fluidity while helping you make the most of\nimmediate technology is a wise move.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **Know by Experimentation**\n\n**Catie Bull, Senior Marketing Manager at Intrepid** speaks of a few questions\nthat organizations need to keep in mind when choosing the right eLearning\nsolution:\n\n  1. How easily does the technology help you reduce the time between designing and delivering training?\n  2. How much can you do directly on the platform (creation, review, etc.) versus having to keep relying on external old-school learning development processes, which cause delays?\n  3. Does this technology give you a way to help learners across multiple \u201cmoments of need\u201d or just one?\n  4. How much control does the technology give to the administrator/course creator vs. the learner themselves?\n  5. How easy is it to make changes in response to real-time feedback?\n  6. How much insight does the technology give you into learner behaviors so you can make changes based on usage and responses in real-time?\n  7. What is not just the company\u2019s level of technological expertise, but their level of expertise in learning experience design using technology?\n  8. Can they make you better learning designers through the use of their online platform?  \nA lot of these questions need to be answered in action and not in thought\nalone. That is where experimentation comes in. Yes, buying the right LMS is a\nbig investment and while you cannot buy one just to see how your organization\nreacts and adapts to it, you could do a trial run. Quite a few solution\nproviders do come with the option for a free trial.\n\n## **Through the Looking Glass: What does the future hold for AI in L &D;?**\n\nNext-generation learning tools include collaborative learning platforms, which\nare more business-centric and individual-driven. Learner Experience Platforms\n(LXP) focus closely on the quality of learner experience. Learning with next-\ngeneration tools moves from the one-to-many classroom-type model to include a\none-to-many along with a many-to-many social and collaborative interaction\nbetween learners, and moderators or subject matter experts as well. This\nstrengthens learning, heightens the sharing of insights, and surfaces tacit\ninstitutional knowledge that all can be shared and iterated upon.\n\nCatie says \u201c **By making the shift from learning to on-the-job application\nsimpler for the learner. Programs and tools which allow easy inclusion of\ncompany context\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d behind all the \u201chow\u201d\u2014bridge the gap between\nknowledge and application back on the job**. They can also allow for\napplication on the job during the learning process, with assignments applying\nconcepts to real work products, with no gap.\u201d She adds that collaborative\nlearning programs spaced out over a period of time also allow for reflection.\nThis is critical to really absorbing and synthesizing new material.\n\n**Mike Begin, VP, Chief Technology Officer at Brainier Solutions** stresses on\nthe fact that \u201cEarly adoption of new technology usually comes with a high\nprice tag. In the case of AI, look for the features that are designed to\nimprove efficiency in L&D.; Features that provide your department the luxury\nto be more strategic than tactical in their duties.\u201d If you considered\nacquiring or licensing technology and relevant content that is aligned with\nyour organization\u2019s broader goals, the road ahead becomes simpler.\n\n**The convenience of predictive search and recommendation engines make\nsearching more efficient. Also, personalized dashboards offer real-time\nanalytics of trends in your learning group to help you stay informed.**\nUltimately, these tools can help to recruit new talent and take calculated\nrisks with more confidence. By viewing technology as an enabler, organizations\ncan benefit from innovation in the learning, development and training space,\nincluding advances in cloud computing, which has made it easier to manage\nchange with speed and dependability. At the heart of it all, remains the\nability and drive to adapt \u2013 to create a culture where employees are\ncomfortably aware of the fact that technology and skills will become redundant\neven faster in the future, and are uncomfortable enough to never become\ncomplacent \u2013 to keep learning, adapting and winning together.\n\n_How are you using AI to improve learning and development at work?

expansion of the current plants as well as a new cracker complex\nplan on the five-year horizon, Chandra Asri Petrochemical Tbk is leaving no\nstone unturned to nurture its human capital for a new digital world, as Lenny\nWoen, HR Strategy & Management General Manager, shares. _\n\n### Q Having joined Indonesia\u2019s largest publicly listed petrochemical company\nin May 2016, what has been your most memorable moment since?\n\nI joined PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical Tbk (CAP) back in May 2016 as I saw\nthat there was a clear direction to transform HR from administration to\nstrategic role.\n\nStarting with shaping our performance management process to compensation &\nbenefits, to establishing organisation & development function, process\nimprovements and digitalisation. I would say that the whole journey at CAP,\nfrom the beginning until today, has been challenging yet rewarding and with\nhuge appreciation to the HR team who has been supportive and worked very hard\nduring our transformation journey.\n\n### Q Presently equipped with a workforce that spans across Cilegon and Serang\nareas, what is the top business need that CAP will be tackling in 2020? What\nrole will HR be playing in this journey?\n\nCAP has developed business strategic direction stretching over a five-year\nterm, which includes expansion of the current plants as well as building a new\ncracker complex within the next five years. For the years ahead, we will be\nfaced with tightening competition, talent war, and technology adoption for all\nof our business processes.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s mission is \"to develop and nurture our human capital\".\nThat means HR plays a critical role in terms of preparing our internal talent\nfor the changes ahead as the company expands and implements all the changes in\nbusiness processes and technologies. We will also have to make our best\nefforts to retain our talent.\n\nWith an objective to build a competent workforce, we are equipping our\nemployees with technical competencies, core and leadership competencies. We\nare also developing career path design as a platform for our employees to grow\nwith the company.\n\n### Q What are the pioneering HR initiatives you are proud of CAP undertaking,\ngiven that you have quite a large blue-collar workforce?\n\nAs the direction has been set to build a competent workforce, our People &\nDevelopment team and the line managers have spent a great deal of time and\neffort to develop the technical competencies library to identify gaps and to\nprepare development programmes.\n\nNot only focused on the hard skills, but we have also balanced these with soft\nskills by renewing our core and leadership competencies to fit into the\nexpectations of our management for the current and future business\nrequirements.\n\n> ##### Throughout our BPI journey, current processes have been mapped,\n> process waste and improvements identified, and new initiatives implemented.\n\n### Q As you\u2019re working on a project to leverage technology for greater\nefficiency, tell us about the business need that led you on this digital\njourney. What initiatives did you implement as part of your transformation?\n\nOur transformation initiatives started based on the company\u2019s business\nstrategic direction, especially in line with the new cracker complex that\u2019s\nunderway. This means we\u2019ll be doubling our workforce in the next five years.\nCoupled with industry 4.0, we saw an urgent need to review our process by\nutilising technology.\n\nWhat we want to achieve is efficient, seamless and integrated HR processes to\nattract and engage our current and future employees, or as the current popular\nterminology suggests, our 'candidate experience and employee experience'. We\nrealised that this would be a challenging process as our HR team consists of\nfive different generations, with years of service ranging from less than one\nyear to more than 20 years.\n\nTo embark on our transformation journey, we introduced the HR Business Process\nImprovement (BPI) initiative, on the basis of Lean Six Sigma concept.\nThroughout our BPI journey, current processes have been mapped, process waste\nand improvements identified, and new initiatives implemented.\n\n### Q Since the adoption of technology, what best practices and innovations\nhave you undertaken to reimagine business as well as workforce experience?\n\nOur approach to moving from manual to automation was to start with small\nprocesses before introducing any big change. We put together a digitalisation\nroadmap to ensure that our technology adoption can be rolled out to achieve\ncandidate and employee experience and our HR processes are seamless and\nintegrated. With the growing number of workforce and massive hiring in the\nnear future, we want to be the employer of choice for our current employees\nand future candidates.\n\n### Q What challenges did you face in this process, and how did you overcome\nthem?\n\nSome challenges that we encountered are in terms of the eagerness to move from\ncomfort zones to disruption mode, the willingness to have an open mindset and\naccept changes, and finally, the generation gaps.\n\nWith continuous support and commitment from the leaders, continuously\npromoting the I-CAP spirit, and BPI sharing, these barriers started to break\ndown and diminish. We want everyone to not only accept but to embrace the\nchange.\n\n### Q What considerations did you have in mind in the selection of a\ntechnology vendor \u2013 any tips to share with your peers in HR?\n\nWe believe that the vendor that helps us to implement any technology should\nnot be a mere consultant but they need to be our partner. They need to own the\ntechnology and be able to share best practices and provide solutions. Changing\nfrom manual to automation can be challenging as we may need to change our work\nprocesses as well.\n\nMoving any processes from manual to automation requires readiness from the\nprocess and also the people. Our technology selection was pretty intensive as\nwe not only needed to consider the system capabilities which are built based\non HR best practices but also to accommodate our processes.\n\n[SAP SuccessFactors (SF)](https://www.successfactors.com/index.html) was our\nchosen technology partner with Performance and Goal Management (PMGM) to\nstart, which later on expanded to other modules such as LMS, Career &\nDevelopment Plan, Recruitment system and Recruitment Marketing system.\n\nWhat\u2019s good about [SF](https://www.successfactors.com/index.html) is that\nthere are constant updates in line with market practices. We plan to leverage\nother modules in order to have an integrated HR system for our processes.\nMoving to more technology-based processes, change management is crucial to\nsuccessfully optimise the technology.\n\n> ##### What\u2019s good about [SF](https://www.successfactors.com/index.html) is\n> that there are constant updates in line with market practices. We plan to\n> leverage other modules in order to have an integrated HR system for our\n> processes.\n\n### Q Many companies admit they are still in the early stages of their digital\ntransformation initiatives. Your advice to them?\n\nAny changes is always difficult but change always happens. Start with\nsomething small, do a pilot test with a smaller group of employees or users,\nbefore implementing to the whole population. Change management is extremely\ncritical. Digital transformation is not only about changing our work processes\nbut also changing the behaviour and mindset of our people.\n\n* * *\n\nEd's note: Lenny Woen was recently awarded the HR Leader of the Year at the\nfirst-ever Indonesia edition of _Human Resources Online 's_ HR Excellence\nAwards:\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03120735/lenny-woen-hrea.jpg)\n\n_Lead photo / Provided_\n\n[Hong Kong HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03102058/sam-dec-burberry-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[Burberry\u5c07\u70ba\u6240\u6709\u54e1\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b18\u661f\u671f\u80b2\u5b30\u5047](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/burberry%e5%b0%87%e7%82%ba%e6%89%80%e6%9c%89%e5%93%a1%e5%b7%a5%e6%8f%90%e4%be%9b18%e6%98%9f%e6%9c%9f%e8%82%b2%e5%ac%b0%e5%81%87/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03112138/MOU-Signing-Ceremony-resized-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[Changi Airport Group commits S$10mn to train 2,000 staff in digital\nskills](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/changi-airport-group-\ncommits-s10mn-to-train-2000-staff-in-digital-skills/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n09/24/2018 Mon 10:33 AM in All markets by [Jerene\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/jerenea/ \"Posts by Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## [Scoot to fly cabin crew hopefuls to Athens or Berlin for epic\ninterview](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/scoot-to-fly-cabin-crew-\nhopefuls-to-athens-or-berlin-for-epic-interview/ \"Scoot to fly cabin crew\nhopefuls to Athens or Berlin for epic interview\")\n\nThis is in line with Scoot's aim to recruit about 1,000 cabin crew over the\nnext 2.5 years as it expands its fleet and network...\n\n09/23/2013 Mon 18:12 PM in Global by [Sabrina\nZolkifi](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/sabrinaz/ \"Posts by\nSabrina Zolkifi\")\n\n## [BlackBerry to axe 4,500 jobs\nglobally](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/blackberry-axe-4500-jobs-\nglobally/ \"BlackBerry to axe 4,500 jobs globally\")\n\nIs this the failing brand\u2019s last ditch attempt to stay afloat?..\n\n01/28/2016 Thu 11:15 AM in Asia by [Akankasha\nDewan](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/akankashad/ \"Posts by\nAkankasha Dewan\")\n\n## [Asia will have the lowest number of women professionals by\n2025](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/asia-will-lowest-number-women-\nprofessionals-2025/ \"Asia will have the lowest number of women professionals\nby 2025\")\n\nOnly 28% of the continent's workforce will comprise of females - lower than\nall other regions worldwide.

That number is expected to grow substantially as workplace trends,\nand state regulations increasingly emphasize workforce training. Recently,\nstates such as New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and California have\npassed laws requiring training in the areas of unlawful harassment,\ndiscrimination and/or retaliation. The trend is expected to continue or even\naccelerate as many other states, including Massachusetts, Illinois, New\nJersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are considering similar or related\nlegislation.\n\nRather than outsource the software development, ThinkHR\u2019s Learn 3.0 was driven\nby customer input and analytics, designed and developed in-house through a\nunique collaboration between the company\u2019s technology and human resources\nexperts. With its latest upgrade, ThinkHR\u2019s platform is positioned for future\ngrowth and immediately provides employers with industry-leading security and\nperformance assurance, as well as an enhanced customer experience.\n\nNathan Christensen, CEO of the newly-combined entity of ThinkHR and [_Mammoth\nHR_](https://www.mammothhr.com), commented, \u201cOur focus is clear: to help\nemployers protect and grow their organizations by delivering the most\ninnovative, trusted solutions in the market. Training has never been more\nimportant, and we\u2019re committed to helping employers not only comply with\nemerging regulations but also build and develop their teams by bringing\ntogether technology and subject matter expertise. We\u2019re excited to announce\nLearn 3.0, which delivers immediate enhancements to our customers and paves\nthe way to future innovation.\u201d\n\nThinkHR\u2019s unique approach to delivering HR solutions is to combine industry-\nleading technology with high-touch employer and partner support in a full\nsuite of people risk management solutions.

Narrow AI focuses on performing a\nspecific job or task and doesn\u2019t have unlimited learning capabilities like in\nthe movies.\n\nToday..\n\nWe use artificial intelligence in the form of Alexa, Siri, Google Home, online\nshopping, search recommendations, and more. If you\u2019ve ever been automatically\ntagged in a photo on Facebook that\u2019s Facebook\u2019s image recognition AI at work.\n\nArtificial intelligence is at work in our lives every day without even\nrealizing it. It serves to make our lives easier but still requires human\ninput to function. Considering the [increasing use of\nAI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/12/19/how-fast-is-\nartificial-intelligence-growing-look-at-the-key-bellwethers/#532f0e17474a),\none of the greatest opportunities for AI to be realized is in [learning\nmanagement systems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-a-learning-management-system-lms/).\n\n## What Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nBefore we jump into the use of artificial intelligence in learning and\ndevelopment, it\u2019s important to understand what AI is. AI or artificial\nintelligence simply refers to the capability machines have to learn and\nprocess data on their own using data sets.\n\nOnce a machine learns from the data they collect, they can make \u201cdecisions\u201d on\ntheir own, based on the data they\u2019ve collected.\n\nMachine learning is simply an extension of AI and refers to machines that are\ntrained to analyze data and trends. These machines build their own algorithms\nfrom the data they collect and use it to make \u201cdecisions\u201d without human\nintervention.\n\n## Learning Management Systems\n\nCurrently, AI plays a small role in learning and development systems through\nE-learning and learning management systems.\n\nThese systems are some of the best ways to help students learn because they\n[increase retention up to\n60%](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/301248/15-facts-and-stats-that-\nreveal-the-power-of-elearning), allow multiple students to receive instruction\nat the same time, and offer opportunities for improvements and customized\neducation in the future.\n\nData gathered by your LMS through surveys, ratings, comments, and course\nmetrics needs to be updated by human hands. And even the best artificial\nintelligence can\u2019t make up for poorly created content.\n\nKeeping learning and development up-to-date through LMS AI resources takes,\ntime and even AI needs a little human help to enhance learning and\ndevelopment.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## The Future of Learning Management\n\nToday\u2019s intelligent learning management systems help pinpoint where students\nneed additional education and training as well as where you can optimize your\ncourse content in a faster and more accurate way than you can without the\nassistance of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut AI\u2019s role is constantly expanding across every industry.\n\nPerhaps the greatest realization for AI in the future of learning and\ndevelopment is that it will help anticipate the user\u2019s learning path and\nbehaviors, predict their learning needs and provide content based on how users\nlearn best and increase the effectiveness of e-learning and LMS courses.\n\n## Anticipated Learning Path\n\nAs AI continues to improve in the future, it will become easier for systems to\ncreate customized learning paths for individual users.\n\nTransforming learning and development through an anticipated learning path\nmeans that artificial intelligence will assess user performance and determine\nwhich information path is best for the user.\n\nAI with these capabilities will provide recommendations on what kinds of\ninformation a user\u2019s needs, much like Netflix or Amazon provides\nrecommendations on what shows you should watch based on your viewing behavior.\n\nAside from helping users find better learning paths, artificial intelligence\ncan also assist in learning and development by helping teaching professionals\nunderstand what their employees need to learn.\n\n## Opportunity Highlight\n\nThrough data pattern identification, learning management systems collect data\nand statistics on students to find learning gaps and opportunities that\nteachers may not have noticed or realized.\n\nUsing pattern identification, and data, artificial intelligence can help\nidentify opportunities to merge new ideas with previous topics to create a\nwell-rounded learning experience for the user. This allows administrators and\nteachers to cover learning gaps they may not even realize exist.\n\n## Course Effectiveness\n\nArtificial intelligence can also assist learning and development efforts by\nhelping teachers find ways to make courses more effective.

Starr Conspiracy\")_ and commissioned by Paycor, this new\nresearch provides data-driven insights from more than 1,000 human resources\n(HR) and finance leaders of SMBs across the U.S. on how they currently create\nand manage their teams, the issues they face, and best practices in\nrecruiting, coaching and developing processes to build effective, high-\nfunctioning teams.  \n\nAccording to a study titled, \u201c _[Impact of Team Work on Employee\nSatisfaction](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3BKHVZurmGfNIEc7V6bpMZ0gYRjNOSHT9XN0Mb58i4NPg_cW7lWz61vpv2TOruCFcvhbN_zmNtMxATGu1GTzx6YZ3llC_94uRbjqCGN8rbHWOgGk-\ngNC0-wd5cYLFaZghBWYu6gYq_8sorRJkprsa6P6Qczs_N_exPvuCip_ZF62kRtXKA3uunpcK-\nzMeVEBPkQLsm6yD1gWQPpJTJkEZVHNUNWVTzTweLkWNMEzBeA= \"Impact of Team Work on\nEmployee Satisfaction\")_ ,\u201d employees who are part of effective teams are more\nlikely to describe themselves as \u201cfully engaged,\u201d more satisfied with their\ncareers and their company, and even more optimistic about their lives outside\nof work. In a high-pressure, competitive work environment, individuals who\nbecome valued team members are more likely to feel more effective, more\ncapable and, therefore, more engaged.\n\nPaycor\u2019s research found that while 67% of small- to medium-sized business\n(SMB) leaders agree that building teams is important, only 31% describe their\nteams as \u201ceffective.\u201d As such, it appears businesses today are struggling to\nbuild successful, high-performance teams.\n\nPaycor\u2019s \u201cHR Benchmark Report: How to Recruit, Coach and Develop Teams\u201d\nreveals core strategies for how SMBs can build \u201ceffective\u201d teams. Key findings\ninclude:\n\n**Include a Mix of Personalities**  \nEighty percent of SMBs say they try to create teams of high performers. Paycor\nfound a widespread bias toward creating the proverbial \u201call-star team,\u201d where\nindividual high performance is based on past measures of success. However,\nType-A high performers can bring a degree of competitiveness to their work\nthat can be counterproductive in a team setting, as the idea of a \u201csuperstar\u201d\npresumes that the person defines themselves by standing out from the crowd. As\nsuch, teams, especially in SMBs, need a mix of personalities, which requires a\nfine tuning of the recruiting process.\n\nSMBs can implement various tips and tools to ensure recruiting for the open\nposition ends in success for the team. Building a hiring profile document\ndescribes the ideal candidate, their role and value they would add to the\nteam, as well as ensure stakeholders to align on exactly who the team is\nlooking to hire. Additionally, interview scorecards help define and\nobjectively standardize the most important criteria for candidate evaluation,\noperationalizing the work done in the hiring profile. And investing in an\nemployee referral program empowers employees to identify and recruit the\npeople with which they most want to share their work lives.\n\n**Establish a Coaching Culture of Feedback**  \nPaycor found less than a third of SMB leaders say they manage team conflict\nwell. Conflict is inevitable, but can be used to a team\u2019s advantage; an\narticle in _[Harvard Business\nReview](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0KPHAjaiH8rNGDgcNfOZxugDqavu7xu6FEwyzGLyLQPL1jvAmnjN7uzdcHa-\ngiCf03rVIULBhBqVv-\nUdVRxBskVhjULLXDdjzPKUQ3-V4V1Beyn53SrILWNUp6XNBEGaUS5QAX24-HFaCLGUcTizOw==\n\"Harvard Business Review\")_ encourages teams to \u201cdisagree more at work\u201d\nbecause healthy conflict tends to lead to better business outcomes. To realize\nthe positive benefits of conflict, SMB leaders need to establish a coaching\nculture of feedback.\n\nA culture of feedback helps take the sting out of conflict. Normalizing\nfeedback tends to have less conflict because negative emotions don\u2019t have a\nchance to take root. Offering employees actionable and potentially life-\nchanging insights on how they can achieve their potential up front and without\ncharge, implementing 360-degree feedback into the performance review process\nfor a holistic view of a team member\u2019s performance and training managers to\ndecipher feedback and convey it in a positive, actionable way prove beneficial\nfor individual employees, healthy for teams and better for the overall\nbusiness.\n\n**Teach Collaboration and Interpersonal Skills**  \nSeventy-six percent of SMB leaders say teams are the best way to get top\nperformance from individuals. But nearly half of SMBs report communication\nbetween team members is a common obstacle to peak team performance.\nFurthermore, a Salesforce\n_[survey](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ERsdNQosJmF6BB9-Ckp3tHhvI7FUAYi1OcjG088VgwXjFEckioyFBmHjdOM-c7nMDHonH8SI5r2nh1AA9QPl_mQvkZimUjTL7odeb2mudiRLIixEjTx4Zy9gtjx9YRtN\n\"survey\")_ of larger, enterprise organizations mirrored Paycor\u2019s findings in\nthe small business world: 86% of employees cite lack of communication and\ncollaboration as a top driver of team failure. As such, SMBs should work to\nshift the focus of teams from individual performance to teaching collaboration\nand interpersonal skills.\n\nCollaboration is a skill that can be learned; it is not a personality trait.\nInvesting in a learning management system (LMS) that enables a wide range of\ncourses, including soft skills like interpersonal communication and\ncollaboration, that offers a variety of formats (online, interactive, self-\npaced) to accommodate diverse learning styles, and promoting peer-to-peer\nlearning, which enables team members to learn from each other, are just a few\nways that collaboration can be a competitive advantage in an increasingly\nknowledge-based economy.\n\nTo access the full report and learn more about how to recruit, coach and\ndevelop teams for better business outcomes, please _[click\nhere.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Lr9Z5i_v0VVBHH2awhM0SEEUDz_UWtLike7-OwWIpbwMLUelhD-\nRhZKEEI_fpGOPmdWRFea8e5jusTRV3os-\nUFk7IKiKJQHUz0JZ1ctEGUEOAkYHlsuiwaCCrK209APvc1sfJt2ftWeyBzIyYn74VhXpWYd8R-ubOlaZCfZT4MRyjalQAh_cLiRKSHVos9BMj859cSszLMA87CuuUsWIhk9awbCAtyJZENXqeQq9PlMmWKl7MUaXs2s_rJmqs52Ihjv9fvTa7OQcnmJ5TMzXSg==\n\"click here.\")_\n\n**Survey Methodology**  \nPaycor and The Starr Conspiracy partnered to produce this report based on an\nanalysis of an online survey. The survey was conducted within the United\nStates by The Starr Conspiracy on behalf of Paycor in October 2019 among 1,100\nadults ages 18 and older who are employed full-time as a finance manager,\ndirector or executive or HR manager, director or executive at a company with\n50-750 employees. Data were not weighted and are only representative of those\nwho completed the survey.\n\n**Supporting Quotes**  \n\u201cThe way organizations of all sizes conduct business today is very different\nthan it was even a year ago,\u201d said Karen Crone, CHRO at Paycor. \u201cAs such,\nbusiness endeavors no longer revolve around the individual, but entire teams\nthat are composed of diverse personalities that play to different strengths\nand offer divergent perspectives. Building an effective, high-performance team\ndoesn\u2019t stop at just hiring the _right_ people, but carries on with coaching\nand development that helps the team continue to learn and grow together, while\nsolving today\u2019s complex business challenges.\u201d\n\n**Supporting Resources**\n\n  * _[The HR Benchmark Report: How to Recruit, Coach and Develop Teams](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ejkoYv-4_eNeY8yqvjYdrMUOiCAdWMH3DO9beCWwZi20Wqsz6SjJad4P5QLlU-_bDY-bB66JqbrXl5iLu410hLsKKIICGqo3vJP2wiYO12PnWZJlygKgvq60hwAKJEp3W3D3U3TWhc8HuYbNxwvKhQFshEbiImp96Yx0p0lGWqrzzOIiX9S-LK_fqyXIOU9IgA93h3o6usqceH--mDpofRIrcs8WmhB4SDBQvUb8DYCd_7qT0DuneyK2-MxnBbp4Iq5Hv_qVnIHxpsOpbZCMwVYlAtA41o25xA-vwHdoh3cJJdJ2rFZRu3LLsL3HzLbixRRTZVcmBTSHTdPQGrF-HQ== \"The HR Benchmark Report: How to Recruit, Coach and Develop Teams\")_\n  *  _[Paycor Website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNVzlznzaXByWU-YwhPMFR9EN5HCDPBCSqSpukA1mIbohIDOvdTcbsobHVsQvOFdlujcLavseRaVKnD07Fb-KlPEA_zhmOetXKp_931UwF5vUN_OwYiqHR72rb-bz-sjahV4qZ40ClhPptApRE894_IImtaOXo-eQ75DURUDcAVRfQ2Ccv4zvaEksaTqQO6j79QKliQLN9VVghmn3PUeyA== \"Paycor Website\")_\n  *  _[Paycor Products](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNVzlznzaXByWU-YwhPMFb0wmZIDRNL46V39FHaxQq0Bu4fE0Om6CPigvxXZcQdQatHGeH7v31p1HYxChIv0E4-yDEOP2iDJl7o3M_RHqJyocdhuoziJIJjLBl-dNDmZWZ3MGgMQceUipomCztlXyP6tbDR2TrJNkzGlRr5hXyGTJkP1wudq0ZtjngoEzG_ybSPXiq-3zEjoNgbozolN0g== \"Paycor Products\")_\n  *  _[Paycor HR Center of Excellence](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNVzlznzaXByWU-YwhPMFRyH7BKdBHrRHo0mqPgmYwaHPaVbBj2WhXZZ9vwRLlizN6Ds5WTaGwXrGaB2ICiVz9Y5DEvFLWMA03zrYPU-zpiUiPfgPi97pciHzx87XYj6gTWtM3smGUlWIQIdgsXUPmz7TOKEui6HaHEJpXuFU-G0LmlqkHjp-ItH5yMO9uEbRUtrRDGzuReL3zo_kgKFU1OjuyzNqw5Z-TqUI4MfAXdfj2-jR9fqGNw5Pm1kQwq5 \"Paycor HR Center of Excellence\")_\n  *  _[Paycor Latest News](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNVzlznzaXByWU-YwhPMFfdPzrxbW4yAPBdEbui_s4TWdG6BuKfkbuftkPgdt2vL2mNMe0C9ob9SBDRW9BvU55ubo42qnsTzuda89LDJzji2y2LJIofT-gOGfwmpiGeKV_KA564kcJsVWDqVezpB_X4fN8Ho83hOxJ9LAicUIj7Ur1tf2Mr8m3uHHrV_BkXZIDM9p2OeN4TZl7wvPUWZqQ== \"Paycor Latest News\")_\n  *  _[Join the Conversation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4Cf8JMRuQ_u62Qu8qBI90M4EAuMSwPecaORPBd3bvw-QyaddGZFlGorAt8tlcNenrAVZiM7SzELH7cHM1UBzu6iNI0eppCWOHlsHpuKfNYg= \"Join the Conversation\")_\n  *  _[Join us on LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PcnNC0TAZ75hBN0gC17AsfXbim5JNSVj6acRG35j1sEw_dnCHSKr0X15OAy59mmChE5U9oLRNs8ZQp1CjPI2jXNRD3kXiabLd02R7ArFQS0= \"Join us on LinkedIn\")_\n\n**About Paycor**\n\nPaycor creates HR software for leaders who want to make a difference.

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### _By referring to people interaction skills as \u2018soft skills\u2019, L &D\nprofessionals are doing it a disservice. Here's what we could be using\ninstead, Jerene Ang shares, in this report on Learning & Development Asia\n2019, Malaysia_\n\nIt's an era where the erstwhile training function has given way to\ncomprehensive learning frameworks that pull data from every aspect of the\ntalent life cycle to create custom learning paths. We have a whole menu of\ntraining programmes to choose from.\n\nNotably \u2013 T&D is now called L&D, where learning & development represents a\nmore comprehensive approach to all types of learning experiences. Which is why\n_Human Resources Online_ chose to rebrand it\u2019s annual conference to Learning &\nDevelopment Asia \u2013 bringing a more contemporary and progressive flavour of L&D\ncontent forward.\n\nProduced by Yee Ching Low, Learning & Development Asia 2019, Malaysia edition\nwas held on 25\u201326 September 2019 at Aloft KL Sentral, Malaysia.\n\nThe two-day conference saw a host of relevant sessions, including a brand new\n90-minute interactive session - called the 'unconference' - where delegates\nhad the opportunity to curate their own content.\n\nFrom the on-site conversations, we gained five tips to upskill your workforce\nfor the future of work.\n\n### **#1 Think big, start small, scale fast**\n\nBefore forming a curriculum or coming up with an L&D programme, start with\nunderstanding the business - in particular the end customers and business\ngoals.\n\nThen, look at what is needed to help ensure customers are satisfied and the\nbusiness can achieve its goals. This can loosely be grouped into three\ncategories:\n\n  * Critical skills and tools\n  * Leadership skills and tools\n  * Customer skills and tools\n\nOnce these are in place, what you need to do to scale quickly is to implement\nmore programmes that meet the needs of different demographics of your\nworkforce.\n\n### **#2 Stop calling soft skills \u2018soft skills\u2019**\n\nWhen talking about skills, there are two very prominent segments - \u2018hard\nskills\u2019 which are very technical in nature, and \u2018soft skills\u2019 which are more\nfocused on people interaction.\n\nDespite the rise of technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) being used\nto improve productivity, the bottom line is - everyone wants to be treated as\na human being. This is in line with the [World Economic Forum\u2019s\nprediction](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/world-economic-forum-on-the-\ntop-10-skills-and-workforce-strategies-in-2020/) that the top five skills in\n2020 are in fact \u2018soft skills\u2019.\n\nHowever, by referring to such skills as \u2018soft skills\u2019, L&D professionals are\ndoing it a disservice. The reason being - when using the word \u2018soft\u2019 to refer\nto such skills, it comes across as something unimportant or good-to-have.\n\nThe L&D function should change the way these skills are referred to. Perhaps\nyou can call it \u2018critical skills\u2019, \u2018dependable skills\u2019, or \u2018vital skills\u2019.\nAfter all, the next big trend isn\u2019t AI or blockchain, it\u2019s humanity.\n\n### **#3 Ignore the 20% and focus on the 30%**\n\nTo survive, become the disruptor instead of the disrupted.\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly changing world, the onus is on L&D professionals to ensure\nthe workforce is ready for the future. However, with the introduction of every\nnew policy or learning programme comes resistance.\n\nThere will always be that 20% who will dislike you for disrupting their lives.\nBut, there will also be the 30% who will give you the buy-in from the start.\nThe remaining 50% - they are indifferent and happy to just ride along.\n\nIf you want to turn things around, ignore the 20% and focus on the 30%. The\nremaining 50% will be with you soon enough.\n\n### **#4 Don\u2019t ignore gig workers. Train them for alignment, not skills**\n\nGig workers are with you now, but may be with your competitors next month. So,\nwhy should your invest in training them? Here are two reasons why:\n\nFirst, half of rewards is not about pay, it is about learning, development,\nand experience. Given this strong correlation, L&D opportunities should be\nprovided to giggers as a means of attraction and retention.\n\nSecond, key challenges in an increasingly gigging workforce include the\ncultural and value disconnect, and risk management and governance in terms of\ncompetition and rival firms. This is why gig workers should be trained on\nalignment - not for skills, given they were hired for their skills in the\nfirst place.\n\n### **#5 Technology is the last thing L &D leaders should think about**\n\n\u201cTechnology is the last thing you should think about.\u201d While it is ironic to\nsay something like this in the era of IR 4.0, it could not be more true,\nespecially when it comes to creating a next generation learning environment\n(NGLE) or integrated learning platforms (ILP).\n\nWhile NGLEs and ILPs leverage heavily on technology, the first thing L&D\nleaders should consider isn\u2019t technology, but the context of their\norganisation.\n\nFirst, look at the purpose of implementing the NGLE or ILP. Examine the\nobjective it is supposed to serve, its context to the business and business\nvalue, as well as the challenges such a system should address.\n\nThen, look internally at the organisation\u2019s personas (leadership, aspiring\ntalent, functional experts, new hires, etc.) and their needs. At the same\ntime, understand the organisation\u2019s digital maturity and learning perception,\nas well as the culture and the ways of working.

Essentially, gathering and assessing people analytics\nleads to better decision-making through the application of statistics and\nother data interpretation techniques.\n\nSmarter, more strategic, and data-backed talent decisions are thus closer at\nhand, and this is applicable throughout the employee lifecycle \u2013 from making\nbetter hiring decisions and more effective performance management to better\nretention.\n\nPeople analytics has evolved considerably from when it was first used in\norganizations in the mid-1900s. There has been a clear transition from\nprescriptive analytics to predictive analytics, with which organizations can\nnow be better prepared to face the dynamism of their operational environment\nand be proactive rather than reactive. For example, sophisticated data\nscience, interactive data visualization, and machine learning \u2013 all integral\nparts of people analytics today \u2013 were nowhere a part of the process until a\nfew decades ago.\n\n## **The Process of People Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics today is a lot more intuitive and predictive. With that\nexpectation to live up to, the process involves the following steps.\n\n![The Process of People Analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Step 1: Dig data that matters**\n\n  \nThe core question to ask here is, \u201cWhat data is relevant to our business\ngoals?\u201d\n\nand to set the key performance indicators (KPIs) accordingly. This allows you\nto save major resources by only investigating areas that need direct\nmonitoring, such as operational tasks within the people management spectrum,\nand can lead to tangible business success.\n\nIf it does not add strategic value, digging that data could be a waste of\ntime. Knowing what to focus on also helps in applying the right statistics,\ndata mining, machine learning, survey management, and strategic workforce\nmanagement tools.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **Step 2: Experiment, explore, enrich**\n\n  \nIn a crowded and visibly fragmented market, it is imperative to choose a\npeople analytics tool by exploring the market, experimenting with different\noptions, and analyzing which option would enrich the organization the most.\nMultiple offerings include data mining, data transformation, and data\nvisualization techniques, all merged into a user-friendly self-service\ninterface.\n\nPlatforms that offer a wide range of features often require a lot of manual\nmanipulation to access important data, and these aspects can be tested only\nthrough systematic experimentation.\n\n### **Step 3: Have an action plan ready**\n\n  \nOnce you know what your end goal is, which data is relevant, and what the\navailable options are (based on clear pros vs. cons analysis), create an\naction plan. Applying big data and predictive analytics to **[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)** , leadership development, and organizational capabilities often\nhelps in fine-tuning the action plan.\n\nMoreover, having a well-defined plan of action enables a better understanding\nof why certain changes may be taking place and where the organization is\nheaded and can thus help garner more stakeholder support.\n\n### **Step 4: Avoid legal loopholes**\n\n  \nEnsuring that legal compliance is maintained in the collection of all data is\ncrucial. Before you start on the analytics project, have a legal team validate\nthe data sourcing techniques and processes. It does not end here.\n\nOnce the raw data has been gathered and treated, the results gleaned need to\nbe approved as well before they can be applied or published. In our digital\necosystem, with data protection and privacy laws still evolving, it is prudent\nto keep abreast of the changes and double-check on legal compliance.\n\n### **Step 5: Create leaner systems**\n\n  \nIrrespective of the complexity of the project at hand, the broader strategy\nthat the processes must adhere to needs to be simple and lean. The basic\nprocess of data analysis and interpretation should allow for easy application,\nupdating, and readability.\n\nFor example, create the basic outline simplified as intake and design (data\ncollection and the design of the analysis), data cleaning (removing irrelevant\nor unreliable data), data analysis (quantitative and qualitative exploration),\nand sharing insights (interpretation and presentation of the data). This can\nhelp avoid unnecessary complications such as confusion about the flow of steps\ninvolved, time wastage, or repetition of sub-processes that occur with\nunstandardized process structures, while still allowing room for tweaks where\nnecessary.\n\nThe idea is to find the right balance between the limited moving parts (people\nand the dynamism of the environment) and fluid, customizable systems and\nprocesses of people analytics. When you have the right team with the relevant\nskillset in place, it is easier to streamline the whole process and apply\nquality controls.\n\n### **Step 6: Build a fact-based, measurable HR business strategy**\n\n  \nA realistic HR business strategy avoids functional silos and can align talent\nto business seamlessly. Having clear KPIs and ROI expectations from people\nanalytics endeavors ensures that the impact is measured often and with\ntransparency. A winning strategy needs to be backed by data and an effective\nplan of action.\n\n### **Step 7: Take tech support**\n\n  \nTechnology is interspersed with every aspect of life today and more so with\nprocesses like people analytics, where often a bulk of analytical data is to\nbe treated with little or no room for error. New-age HR tech tools make real-\ntime data easily accessible. And this is an opportunity that needs to be\nmilked because today, agility and real-time intelligence can truly set you\napart from the competition.\n\n## **Four Key People Analytics Trends**\n\nSince people analytics relies heavily on evolving data-mining technologies and\ndata-interpretation strategies, the trends around people analytics develop in\ntime to the same. Here are the top 4 trends that are shaping people analytics\nin itself and how it interacts with the business. Some trends work in a dual\nloop \u2013 they affect people analytics and in turn, all other aspects of HR.\n\n![Four Key People Analytics Trends](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **1\\. Transforming what HR is and does**\n\n  \nBersin research points out that a meager 2% of HR organizations have mature\npeople analytics competence to bank on. There is thus quite a heavy first-\nmover advantage for innovative, intelligent organizations that are trying to\ntap into this space.\n\nWith people analytics changing how recruitment is conducted, how performance\nis measured, how compensation is planned or growth is mapped, and how learning\nand retention can be managed better, people analytics is quickly changing how\nHR operates.\n\nAccording to recent studies by Deloitte, increasing job offer acceptance\nrates, reducing HR help tickets, and optimizing compensation are just a few\nways in which people analytics is quickly becoming the new currency of HR.\nMoreover, with HR processes evolving to keep pace with business needs, people\nanalytics is moving from being a one-time initiative to becoming a real-time,\neasily modifiable tool that HR has immense benefits to draw from.\n\n### **2\\. Transforming HR business interactions**\n\n  \nWith recent trends in the work ecosystem, the interaction between HR and\nbusiness stakeholders (both internal and external) has been undergoing a\ntransformation as well. People analytics needs to change in keeping with the\nlatest trends in leadership. More transparency is a key trend emerging here,\nand intelligent insight is the need of the hour.\n\nBusinesses today need to be able to make sense of seemingly unrelated data\nstreams and find meaning, correlation, and maybe even interdependence between\none or more factors to predict and manage work better. People analytics has\nthe potential to provide actionable recommendations to enable strategic\nplanning and execution processes.\n\n### **3\\. Transforming the HR-employee relationship**\n\n  \nEmployee expectations today are consumer-grade. People analytics is providing\norganizations with the ramp to upgrade the **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)**. Every interaction that a candidate or an employee\nhas with an organization is a data point and could be utilized to glean\ninteresting insights. The idea is the need to transform the relationship that\nthe HR has with employees \u2013 to help HR become and be perceived as more than\njust a support function.\n\n### **4\\. Transforming the quality of insights**\n\n  \nThe quality of insights that are expected on a daily basis has changed over\nthe course of the last couple of years. People analytics can live up to these\nexpectations if you focus on two key aspects: analytics literacy and data\nsecurity.\n\nMore employees will need to become analytics literate to decrease dependence\non technical staff and to allow more perspectives to flourish. As people\nanalytics becomes a staple at organizations, data integrity and data security\nwill need to be upgraded and maintained for all listening channels and pulse\nchecks.\n\nWe discussed legal compliance, but data security should ideally go deeper than\nthat and become a cultural trait within the organization rather than being\nsuperficial check just for the sake of being compliant.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Three Key Level-based Checks to Choose the Right People Analytics Tools**\n\nWith a vast array of available vendors, options, and subscription plans,\nchoosing the right people analytics tools can often seem like a rather\ndaunting task. Here\u2019s a three-level need-based check to make the right\ndecision.\n\n### **Level 1: A working HR dashboard**\n\n  \nTo get started with people analytics, use a basic dashboard that allows you to\ncapture, aggregate, and visualize data.\n\nTools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik allow ease of use and ease of data\naccess. With a level 1 requirement, your priority should be to keep your\npeople analytics system as simple as possible.\n\n### **Level 2: An insightful HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYou may have a steady dose of relevant data and need basic insights to analyze\nbetter and make stronger decisions. Statistical tools like Excel or SPSS are\neffective as well, though they may not come with quirky visual aids and\nsocial-media style interfaces. Tools like Visier, while taking some time to be\nset up, come with holistic analytics solutions.\n\n### **Level 3: A predictive HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYour organization is at the third requirement level when you seek not only to\nanalyze data but also to make intuitive predictions based on upcoming trends.\nThese tools help you study behavior in a way that you can predict the next\ncourse of action.\n\nFor example, there might be some correlation between your employees updating\ntheir LinkedIn page, taking frequent leaves, and with them not being very\ncontent at work. While this is a very simplistic situation, predictive tools\ncould help you make connections with behavior and decision patterns that you\nmight have missed otherwise.\n\nPython or RStudio can help with advanced analyses for large quantities of\ndata, though they might require you to hire data scientists specialized in the\nfield.\n\n## **Update, Upgrade, and Upskill for Smarter People Analytics**\n\nWith the latest people analytics and workforce analytics solutions, you can\ndelve deeper into the behavioral aspects of work, understand the cause-effect\nrelationship between different human and non-human aspects at work, and make\nbetter decisions.\n\nThe three points to remember are to know what data you need to quantify and\nqualify, to understand what the latest trends are, and to know what your end\ngoals are. Enabling your HR to update, upgrade, and upskill their knowledge\nand capabilities will ensure that your organization optimizes the latest\npeople analytics offers and can ride the latest trend waves towards a smarter,\nhappier workforce.\n\n_What people analytics trends do you predict for 2020?

Since\nevery organization has unique talent needs that evolve in tandem with business\nstrategies, the ways to manage these talent requirements need to be tailored\nas well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the 4 steps in choosing the best-fit solution for your business.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze your needs for today and tomorrow**\n\n  \nTo judge whether an HCM software vendor is the right fit for your business\nneeds, you must first analyze what your needs are \u2013 at present and for the\nfuture. Furthermore, it helps to have a need-map of your must-have, good-to-\nhave, and great-to-have needs. Then, match this wishlist of sorts with the\nfeatures and functionalities that any solution offers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assess integration capabilities**\n\n  \nOnce you know what it is that you are looking for in an HCM software, it is\ntime to zone in on your SaaS options. Integrating all HR functions into a\nsingle HCM platform comes with assured cost benefits.\n\nThe task here is to understand which software components need to interact and\nshare data. For example, does your applicant tracking system (ATS) link into\nyour onboarding processes? The right HCM software offering will grow with your\nbusiness, and finding a solution that has the capabilities to integrate myriad\nfunctionalities and to grow is half the battle won.\n\n### **Step 3: Ascertain compliance risks**\n\n  \nWith local and federal regulations in a constant state of flux to incorporate\nand address the evolution of the business ecosystem, it is imperative to\nensure that your processes to manage your human capital are compliant. It\nhelps to stay updated on new laws and amendments, and thus, working with a\nvendor who is ready to evolve with these changes makes a big difference.\n\n### **Step 4: Appraise data security options**\n\n  \nA vendor that ensures data protection and cybersecurity and has a proven\nrecord of being able to manage both areas is a good bet. Since HCM software\nare basically powerhouses of data, strong security procedures need to be\napplied. These procedures also need to evolve with changes in data processes,\ntrends, and privacy policies.\n\nChoosing the right HCM software for your unique business needs is thus\ndependant on how well you understand these needs, the level of market research\nyou conduct to map out the pros and cons of viable options and the goals that\nyou have set for the future.\n\n**_What key features do you look for in your HCM solution?

Josh Bersin, president and\nfounder of Bersin & Associates (now known as Bersin by Deloitte) coined the\nterm \u201c[learning experience platform](https://www.g2.com/categories/learning-\nexperience-platform-lep)\u201d (also known as LEP and LXP) to encapsulate this\nexpansion. And the industry just keeps expanding\u2014the global [training\neLearning](https://www.g2.com/categories/training-elearning) market, including\n[corporate LMS](https://www.g2.com/categories/corporate-lms) and LEPs, is\nexpected to hit [$200\nbillion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/e-learning-market-to-\nhit-us-200-billion-by-2024-1005334047) by 2024.\n\n[![See the Highest-Rated Learning Experience Platform \\(LEP\\) Software, Free\n\u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/5cf2a4c0-c475-4b19-9349-1f38aebcb8eb.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/5cf2a4c0-c475-4b19-9349-1f38aebcb8eb)\n\nAccording to G2\u2019s [employee engagement](/2019-employee-engagement) report,\nonly 34% of non-HR employees surveyed feel more engaged than they did the\nprevious year. Meanwhile, according to a recent [Gallup\nreport](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-\nreport-2017.aspx), 51% of American workers are actively looking for a\ndifferent job or keeping an eye on job openings.\n\nCompanies that develop initiatives to engage their workforce will experience\nan increase in retention, productivity, and morale. And there are many\npossible methods to improve employee engagement; it might come in the form of\nsoftware, career management, or training and education initiatives, to name a\nfew. Investing in a thorough onboarding process and training regimen will not\nonly engage employees from Day 1 but will improve retention by continually\nmoving employees forward on their career paths.\n\nEngaged employees are those with a sense of purpose and belonging. What better\nway to engage employees than by giving them control over their learning and\nallowing them to choose how and when they learn and grow?\n\n[![Are employees as engaged as HR teams believe?

These learning technologies are often referred to as a\n\u201cNetflix for learning.\u201d Rather than administrative-driven courses sent to\nspecific departments or employees, with these programs, employees can choose\nfrom a selection of easily accessible content that\u2019s discoverable and\nshareable by all employees at a company.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Learning experience platforms vs. learning management systems**\n\n\n\n_**Choice \u2014**_ The learner gets to choose how and when to engage with\nmaterials of their choice. As referenced above,  employees have the option to\ninfluence their own learning experiences instead of taking administrative-\ndriven courses.\n\n_**Content \u2014**_ Learning platforms directly impact the amount of available\ncontent. LMS are typically closed systems, meaning only administrators can\nchoose and add content. This can result in a narrow selection of learning\ncontent, as administrators must curate the selection of materials. LEPs, on\nthe other hand, are open systems, which allow users\u2014from learning and\ndevelopment (L&D) directors to employees\u2014to select and build content that\nsuits their personal learning interests.\n\n_**Directed vs. personalized learning \u2014**_ LMS are typically used by L&D\ndirectors and HR departments to ensure employees adhere to internal standards\nas well as pertinent laws and regulations. This training is typically given to\nemployees during the onboarding process and as new processes and regulations\narise. The learning content is often presented in the style of a course and\nmay include text, video, or audio followed by a quiz to be completed by a\nspecific time and day.\n\n[![Find the best Corporate LMS Software on the market.

Meanwhile,\nLEPs are designed to provide employees with options based on the skills\nnecessary to develop in their current roles, and it provides the option of\nlearning new content outside their current position. These systems let users\nchoose content including external, internal or subject matter expertise (SME).\nThis is why LEPs are called Netflix-style systems.\n\nThere are various learning experience platform providers available and each\nhas advantages and disadvantages. Some integrate directly with corporate LMS\nto extend the reach of these training solutions, some provide microlearning\nfeatures, and on and on.\n\n## Benefits of LEPs\n\n  * Empower and engage employees\n  * Promote career development\n  * Address skills gaps\n  * Recognize employee expertise\n\nBusinesses are focusing on training and learning initiatives and empowering\nemployees to direct what, when and where they learn. Many learning experience\nplatforms integrate with LMS to enhance these systems. Depending on the size\nof the company and its training needs, LEPs can be used to engage employees\nwith enticing learning content beyond compliance- and position-related skills\ntraining.\n\n**Check out these[employee training](/employee-training) ideas create an\nengaging employee training experience.**\n\n[ ![Courtney\nMoran](https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-28%20at%2012.54.37%20PM.png)\n](https://learn.g2.com/author/courtney-moran)\n\n[ Courtney Moran ](https://learn.g2.com/author/courtney-moran)\n\n[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csmoran/)[__](https://twitter.com/G2Courtney)[__](https://learn.g2.com/employee-\nengagement-infographic?rel=author)\n\nCourtney is G2's senior research analyst for HR technologies, whose coverage\nareas include recruiting, employee engagement, and talent management.

Consumers have much higher expectations when it comes to\nspeed, convenience, and personalization, which has caused retailers to rethink\ntheir business models. And through this transformation, retailers are\nempowering their employees to learn new skills and hiring talent for positions\nthat didn\u2019t exist before, all with the goal of delivering a better customer\nexperience. This ability to redefine and upskill the retail workforce is what\nseparates retailers who will succeed from the ones who will eventually become\na distant memory.\n\nWe recently chatted with Polly Foote, head of HR operational excellence at\nFerguson Enterprises, the largest plumbing distributor in the United States.\nIn addition to plumbing parts and supplies, Ferguson also sells faucets,\nsinks, and accessories, has nine retail brands, and sells its products at\nshowrooms across the country. Foote shares insight into the company\u2019s approach\nto training and retaining their employees during a time of disruptive change.\nRead on to learn how Ferguson is partnering with Workday to create a new\nlearning strategy for its associates\u2014further developing their skill sets and\ncareers.\n\n**One of Ferguson\u2019s core values is investing in its employees. Can you tell us\na bit more about how you\u2019re doing that from a training and development\nperspective?  **\n\nFerguson stands by the saying, \u201cIf we make our associates happy, they\u2019ll make\nour customers happy.\u201d This philosophy is aligned to our approach of doing\nbusiness, which is to focus on associate and customer relationships. That\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019re continuing to invest time and extensive training in our associates\nto ensure they perform to the best of their abilities.\n\nWe had been using the same learning management system (LMS) for many years,\nwhich unknowingly got us into some ruts from a training and development\nperspective. So, we knew we needed a new learning system. At the same time, we\nwere also evaluating a new HR system. We had a separate applicant tracking\nsystem, learning management system, and a few other internal systems that we\ncould never cleanly report across. Having one system and one security model is\nhuge and saves a lot of time, and led to us selecting [Workday Human Capital\nManagement ](https://www.workday.com/en-us/applications/human-capital-\nmanagement.html)(HCM) and [Workday Learning](https://www.workday.com/en-\nus/applications/human-capital-management/learning.html). We were the first\ncompany to deploy both products at the same time.\n\n**What are some of the benefits you\u2019ve seen from having HR and learning\nmanagement in one system?**\n\nThe biggest benefit is we now have real-time access to other HCM touchpoints.\nWe no longer have to pre-plan all of the touchpoints that we\u2019re interested in\nbecause they are already available in the same system. This allows us to\nincorporate learning into our day-to-day business transactions.\n\nFor example, if one of our employees changes jobs, Workday can automatically\ndetect that the job change may require additional training. We don\u2019t have to\nsend a message to another system to trigger the learning. It also makes it\neasier for our employees to complete their training since they\u2019re already\nfamiliar with the Workday system from an HR perspective and understand how to\nnavigate its various features. It\u2019s a huge benefit when they can focus on\nunderstanding the learning versus having to learn a new system as a whole.  \n\n**How has your approach to employee learning and development changed since\ndeploying Workday?**\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the way we think about courses. When\nsetting up a new course in our previous LMS, we\u2019d first think about the course\nname, communication skills, and then the delivery method (instructor led\nversus web based). Workday has this approach flipped\u2014it has you decide your\ndelivery method first, then the topic and title come after that. That really\nshows you that Workday has the user experience in mind first.\n\nThis approach caused us to think about our learning functionality strategy as\na whole, and we recommend others do the same. It\u2019s important to have a\nstrategy in place first so you can leverage the functionality as quickly as\npossible. You also want to make sure you have established processes to quickly\ndevelop and execute on some of the quick wins, as well as processes for the\nlarger, more involved functionality you may have to set up. That\u2019s essential\nbecause you don\u2019t want to just launch a new learning program and then stay\nstagnant.\n\n**How are you continuing to mature and evolve employee learning and\ndevelopment?**\n\nOur internal conversations have shifted from course buildout to a\ncomprehensive learning strategy. Workday has taken our learning and\ndevelopment programs to new levels. This year, we\u2019re really focused on\ndeveloping integrated modes of learning, which include self-study, virtual\ninstructor-led, and in-person sessions all in one. We\u2019ve also begun using\n[Skills Cloud](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/newsroom/press-\nreleases/press-release-details.html?id=1588881) in our performance management\nprocess. We plan to integrate skills into our learning and job profiles so\nthat we can be more prescriptive with the type of learning programs that we\noffer our associates.\n\nWe\u2019re also excited for what\u2019s further on the horizon. We are looking forward\nto adding course surveys and building learning pathways, which are already\navailable but haven\u2019t been rolled out at our company just yet. Analytics will\nalso play a key role in ensuring that we\u2019re providing relevant content and\nidentifying and addressing any gaps we may have in our programs. We are also\nthrilled to begin our journey into user-generated content, allowing crowd-\nsourcing to capture the wisdom and experience from our field associates.\n\n_Check out a  _[ _recent webcast_](https://forms.workday.com/en-\nus/webinars/wb-ferguson-enterprises-and-workday/form.html) _  that we hosted\nwith Ferguson Enterprises to learn more about their learning transformation._\n\n_This story was originally published on the  _[ _Workday\nblog_](https://blogs.workday.com/reskilling-your-workforce-for-the-changing-\nworld-of-retail/) _.

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Among the various learning points derived from the on-site conversations\namong HR leaders at Talent Management Asia 2019, Malaysia,_ Jerene Ang _sums\nup seven of them here._\n\nHaving hosted [Talent Management Asia\n2019](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/talent-management/2019/my), the\nregion\u2019s leading human capital strategy conference, for seven years; this\nyear, the _Human Resources_ project team, led by Heather Ang, decided it was\ntime to breathe new life into the event.\n\nThis year, the Malaysia edition of the conference was held at New World\nPetaling Jaya Hotel on 26 to 27 March 2019. The two-day conference was\nattended by more than 150 people, and saw over 30 speakers taking the stage to\nshare trends and best practices. [[check out some of the event\nphotos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/humanresourcesonline/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2473614826003475)]\n\nFor an enhanced learning experience, various engaging and innovative session\nformats were introduced, such as the 20-20 Case Study, Knowledge Caf\u00e9,\nFishbowl Panel, Solution Room and Fireside Chat. A fun game of HR Bingo was\nalso weaved into the programme to bring up the atmosphere.\n\nTo facilitate context-relevant learning, and high interactivity, delegates had\naccess to three breakout streams: Leading Strategic Talent Management, Riding\nthe Digital Wave, and SMEs - Time to Sink or Swim.\n\nAfter starting with a few plenary sessions in the morning of day one,\ndelegates then split into the streams, where they remained for the second half\nof day one and first half of day two before grouping back together for the\nclosing plenary sessions on day 2.\n\n[[check out some of the event\nphotos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/humanresourcesonline/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2473614826003475)]\n\nAmong the innumerable nuggets of learning derived from the on-site\nconversations, we summed up our top seven below:\n\n### #1 EX = CX = ROI\n\nYour employee experience is your customer experience. If your employee\nexperience is there, your customer experience will fall in place.\n\nTo get the employee experience right, you have to know what your employees\nwant. In general, employees want 4Es - they want to be empowered, enabled,\nhave experiential opportunities, and to be engaged. But in order to have these\n4Es, you have to have the 4Rs - you have to give them a real job, real\nopportunity, real experience, and real stories.\n\nWhen creating a good employee experience, start with a high trust culture. If\nyou don\u2019t already have one, find out why and address the problem. If you\nalready have a high trust culture, make sure it aligns to your company values,\nthen sustain the experience. If your culture is not aligned to the company\nvalues, you have to make sure leaders start living the company culture from\nthe top.\n\nIn the process, one of the challenges you may face is convincing the top\nmanagement that allowing flexibility is the way to go. To do so, you need to\nstart with a pilot. The management have been running the company for many\nyears, so you can\u2019t just throw out all the old practices at one go. You also\nneed to engage the right people and get them to be your advocates.\n\n### #2 Culture or/and strategy?\n\nCulture or strategy? It\u2019s culture and strategy. Both are important. In surveys\nwe ask which one has a greater impact on business? 96% of CEOs say Culture,\nbut when we ask what they spend their time on, 74% spend their on Strategy,\nwhile only 26% spend time on Culture. Why does that happen?\n\nBecause strategy is what they learn. Nobody teaches you how to shape and build\nyour culture in MBA courses. Everyone needs to understand what the culture of\nthe organisation is.\n\nAnd when it comes to transforming organisational culture, the reason is all\nabout the top three or four key results that you want to achieve differently,\nfor example, customer experience. There have to be very specific reasons\nbehind it.\n\n### #3 Design principles for LMS 2.0\n\nThe learning management system of tomorrow would be designed with the\nfollowing principles in mind:\n\n  * Capability cannot be built adhoc, it has to be continuous. The learning starts when an employee joins, and stops only when they leave.\n  * Learning cannot be course based. It has to be based on skills and competencies needed to do the job better.\n  * Short and bite-sized learning to suit today's workplace demands.\n  * Learning must be done in the flow of work. Employees are saying, 'give me learning when I\u2019m sitting beside the customer so I can answer their questions better'.\n  * Personalised learning. The journey should be fully blended. Some should be classroom based, some online based and some micro learning.\n\n### #4 Preparing leaders for the future\n\nIn today's world where technology disruption is happening faster than ever\nbefore, the question for HR now is: Are we preparing for the new jobs?\n\nResearch have shown that 10 years from now, 40% of the world's leading\ncompanies today will not exist in any meaningful form. Learning from past\nexperiences of companies like Nokia and Kodak, in HR, it's not enough to not\ndo anything wrong - not doing anything wrong just means a slower path to\nextinction.\n\nWith the rapid advancement of technology and AI, in the future, the cognitive\naspects of the work will be taken over. It is the emotional aspects that\ncannot be taken over yet.\n\nHence, as HR, it is imperative to focus on the essential skills first - the\nsoft skills, things like persuasion, negotiation, emotional intelligence,\nleadership, and resilience.\n\nIn such an environment, there is also a need to rethink what business is about\nand how to ensure society benefits from the fourth industrial revolution. As\nthings are changing, we have to evolve, and we have to change fast, but some\nthings must stay true. In such an environment, the leader needs to play the\nanchor - they must stay true to their purpose and values.\n\n### #5 Ensuring gender parity in boardrooms\n\nWhen it comes to gender parity in the boardrooms, organisations have the key\nresponsibility to start it at the management. But it doesn\u2019t only need to be\nin the organisation. It also needs to be at the policy level in the government\nand in the society level.\n\nOn the individual level, both genders have a part to play.\n\nWomen need to speak up and own the space. Visibility and confidence should be\nwomen's best friends.\n\nMen have to play a part too. In fact, it starts with the men - how much\nencouragement and support do men give their partners? Because, without the\nsupport from men, women will continue to face pressure at work and at home.\n\n### #6 How to manage a multi-generational workforce\n\nWhen managing a multi-generational workforce, conflict may arise - especially\nin cases raised where the younger generation's hunger for career progression,\nconflicts with older employees who are uncomfortable reporting to someone\nyounger.\n\nIn such a scenario, it is essential for HR to consider why the younger\nemployee has been promoted to a higher position. If they are promoted based on\nmerit, then it is easy to justify and mitigate the problem.\n\nHowever, if they are promoted for the sake of giving them the progression they\nwant, then it's time to rethink the definition of 'career progression'.\n\nWhile career progression is usually defined as moving up the career ladder, we\nhave to remember that since the ladder is no longer relevant - it's more of a\njungle gym now - lateral moves are also considered progression.\n\nThis mindset change needs to happen especially since three generations are\nalready in the workforce with a fourth about to enter.\n\n### #7 Ensuring successful culture change\n\nYou've probably heard the saying \"people leave managers, not companies.\" But\nthat's only part of the problem. In a good company, bad managers make a\ndifference; however, in bad companies, good or bad managers do not make a\ndifference to an employee's decision to leave.\n\nHence, it is more important to focus on the organisation culture and\nbehaviours. The change needs to start from the top as the behaviour of leaders\nwill help shape the culture.\n\nHowever, you can't just put the culture there and expect people to follow it.\nYou also have to share the strategy behind it and how it can help the\nbusiness, as well as tell the individuals what is in it for them.\n\nCulture change has to start in small steps, with the key success factor being\nengagement. The more you engage, the better the results.\n\n* * *\n\nThis knowledge was shared at the _Human Resources\u2019_ conference, [Talent\nManagement Asia 2019, Malaysia](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/talent-\nmanagement/2019/my).

Learning Experience Platform attempts to create a \u2018Netflix-like\u2019 learning\nenvironment, drawing in employees through targeted content, social media\nsupport, and intelligent recommendations. We look at what is a Learning\nExperience Platform in its essence and explore how it could replace a\nstandalone LMS._**\n\nFirst popularized by leading industry analyst Josh Bersin, a Learning\nExperience Platform promises to be the next big thing in corporate upskilling,\ndelivering a holistic landscape where employees can continuously interact and\ngain insights.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nAt first glance, a Learning Experience Platform can sound similar to a\ntraditional LMS. Both are used to disseminate learning programs, both provide\noptions to track progress and certifications/achievements and finally both\nfall roughly within the same ambit of driving new skills. So, in a crowded\ntech marketplace full of MOOC courses, LMS suites, corporate learning \u2018games\u2019,\nand custom e-authoring tools, what sets the Learning Experience Platform\napart? Let\u2019s look at this in deeper detail.\n\n**Also Read:[4 MOOC Trends We Expect to See in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/4-mooc-\ntrends-we-expect-to-see-in-2019/)**\n\n## What is a Learning Experience Platform\n\nJosh Bersin _[likened](https://joshbersin.com/2017/06/a-new-world-of-\ncorporate-learning-arrives-and-it-looks-like-tv/)_ this technology to the\nNetflix of learning and development. Just like Netflix revolutionized content\nconsumption by creating an aggregated portal for on-demand content, driven by\nAI-led recommendations, a Learning Experience Platform tries to recreate\nsimilar levels of engagement and interactivity.\n\nA Learning Experience Platform isn\u2019t a standalone technology or app. Rather,\nit leverages a variety of existing learning methodologies to curate and\naggregate a holistic learning portal. According to Bersin, this entails almost\ntelevision-like experiences, suggesting the \u2018most popular\u2019 courses creating\ncustomized content channels that users can follow and recommendations on what\nto learn based on skillsets explored before. These would intersect micro-\nlearning or bite-sized content pieces (videos, podcasts, and animations) as\nwell as macro formats (long-form articles, e-books, and corporate\npresentations).\n\nUnlike a television experience, however, a company would be able to\nindividually curate the material it chooses to make available to the\nworkforce. The impact could be further amplified via branding elements and UI,\nimproving recall.\n\nOnce we are clear on what is a Learning Experience Platform, let\u2019s look at its\nadvantages over the traditional LMS.\n\n**Also read:[How Micro Learning is Transforming Workforce\nEfficiency](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nmicro-learning-is-transforming-workforce-efficiency/)**\n\n## Four Reasons Why a Learning Experience Platform Could Replace your LMS\n\n  1. **Extend Learning Opportunities** \\- An LMS, by definition, is a closed system that does not allow users to go beyond a set track or learning pathway. Learning Experience Platforms, on the other hand, are far more flexible with employees free to pick and choose their courses, watch at their leisure, and complete certifications (or not, if they so choose).\n  2. **Appeal to their Digital Side** \\- More often than not, your employees are always learning on the side, reading a vast selection of online publications or enrolling in open online courses like MOOCs, through their personal devices. With a Learning Experience Platform, you have visibility across all of these, gaining a 360-degree picture of a worker\u2019s true capabilities and interest areas.\n  3. **Empower your Learners -** A Learning Experience Platform is employee-driven, meaning your workforce enjoys greater control and can proactively choose what they want to learn. With seamless social integration, they can even share their learnings and new content discoveries with their colleagues.\n  4. **Encourage LGC Uploads** \\- Learner Generated Content or LGC could be a great way for employees to showcase their new skills/knowledge base, encouraging like-minded users to log in and participate. It also makes it easy for managers to spot errors, gaps, or outstanding performance incidences.\n\n**Also read:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\nA good example of a Learning Experience Platform is probably LinkedIn Learning\nin its newest avatar, unveiled last November. \u201cWe launched LinkedIn Learning,\nbringing together this expert-led content from Lynda.com with LinkedIn\u2019s\nprofessional insights and social experiences to create a uniquely personalized\nand interactive learning experience platform,\u201d\n_[wrote](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/learning-development/linkedin-\nexpands-learning-platform/)_ Hari Srinivasan, Senior Director Product\nManagement, LinkedIn Learning.

In this paradigm, a Learning Experience\nPlatform doesn\u2019t just mean you\u2019re a step ahead in a competitive hiring\nenvironment, it implies that you spend less on constant LMS upgrades with a\nsystem that\u2019s agile, future-ready, and \u2013 perhaps, most importantly \u2013 designed\nfor the Netflix generation.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fwhat-is-a-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-\nyour-\nlms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=What+is+a+Learning+Experience+Platform+%28LXP%29%2C+and+Can+it+Replace+your+LMS%3F\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+is+a+Learning+Experience+Platform+%28LXP%29%2C+and+Can+it+Replace+your+LMS%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fwhat-is-a-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-\nyour-\nlms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fwhat-is-a-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-\nyour-\nlms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fwhat-is-a-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-\nyour-\nlms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=What is a Learning Experience Platform\n\\(LXP\\), and Can it Replace your\nLMS?&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fwhat-is-a-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-\nyour-\nlms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

This enables\norganizations to streamline the qualification process and ensure that employee\nqualifications remain current by tracking employee qualifications, monitoring\nqualification expirations, and maintaining the qualification history of\nemployees and subcontractors. When a qualification is linked to a training\ncourse, that course can automatically be assigned to the employee or\nsubcontractor.\n\n ** _AiThority.com News:_** _[Latest Automation Trends Show Power Over\nEthernet Technology in Digital Building\nApplications](https://www.aithority.com/technology/latest-automation-trends-\nshow-power-over-ethernet-technology-in-digital-building-applications/)_\n\n\"By upgrading our LMS architecture, we are now able to offer a faster, more\nstreamlined user experience,\" said [Carl L.\nMcCauley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlmccauley/), CEO for 360factors, Inc.\n\"We've recently onboarded five new bank customers and are confident this is\nthe most unique risk and compliance platform available for banks and financial\nservices organizations today.\"\n\nTraining plans can be created at the corporate, site and group level with\ntracking and management features for online classroom, web-based training, and\nad-hoc training records. Hundreds of training content options are available\nthrough integrated content plug-ins from banking industry partners. Customers\ncan also upload their own training courses.\n\n ** _AiThority.com News:_** _[Enterprises in Germany Move Toward Smart\nFactories in Response to\nGlobalization](https://www.aithority.com/news/enterprises-in-germany-move-\ntoward-smart-factories-in-response-to-globalization/)_\n\n[360factors](https://www.aithority.com/tag/360factors/) [Financial\nServices](https://www.aithority.com/tag/financial-services/) [Learning\nManagement System](https://www.aithority.com/tag/learning-management-system/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/)\n[Predict360](https://www.aithority.com/tag/predict360/) [Qualification\nManagement](https://www.aithority.com/tag/qualification-management/) [risk and\ncompliance](https://www.aithority.com/tag/risk-and-compliance/)\n[tracking](https://www.aithority.com/tag/tracking/) 2020-02-19\n\n**[AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/ \"Posts by\nAIT News Desk\") **\n\nTags [360factors](https://www.aithority.com/tag/360factors/) [Financial\nServices](https://www.aithority.com/tag/financial-services/) [Learning\nManagement System](https://www.aithority.com/tag/learning-management-system/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/)\n[Predict360](https://www.aithority.com/tag/predict360/) [Qualification\nManagement](https://www.aithority.com/tag/qualification-management/) [risk and\ncompliance](https://www.aithority.com/tag/risk-and-compliance/)\n[tracking](https://www.aithority.com/tag/tracking/)\n\n[__\nTwitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/360factors-\nannounces-upgraded-learning-management-system-lms-for-the-predict360-risk-and-\ncompliance-intelligence-platform/\n\"360factors+Announces+Upgraded+Learning+Management+System+%28LMS%29+for+the+Predict360+Risk+and+Compliance+Intelligence+Platform\")\n[__\nFacebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/360factors-\nannounces-upgraded-learning-management-system-lms-for-the-predict360-risk-and-\ncompliance-intelligence-platform/) [__ Google\n+](https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/360factors-\nannounces-upgraded-learning-management-system-lms-for-the-predict360-risk-and-\ncompliance-intelligence-platform/) [__\nlinkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/360factors-\nannounces-upgraded-learning-management-system-lms-for-the-predict360-risk-and-\ncompliance-intelligence-platform/ \"360factors Announces Upgraded Learning\nManagement System \\(LMS\\) for the Predict360 Risk and Compliance Intelligence\nPlatform\") More\n\n###  Authors\n\n![AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Newsdesk-180-x-180-150x150.jpg)\n\nPosted by : [AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/\n\"Posts by AIT News Desk\")\n\nAIT News Desk is a trained group of web journalists and reporters who collect\nnews from all over the technology landscape.

Today, HR Technology is about how employee-centric and employee-\nfriendly the process or tool is. Tech-driven talent management has the\npotential to create a great competitive advantage. Merely institutionalizing\ntechnology will no longer work. HR systems must be centred on the fulcrum of\nan organization- its people.\n\nFor this, only a deep dive into employees\u2019 needs, wants and aspirations can\ncreate employee-friendly tools and systems. Design thinking can help bring\nchange by offering methodologies to reinvent work. Here\u2019 how:\n\n  * Enhance the employee experience by creating user-friendly IT systems and digital tools that empower the employee.\n  * Create a culture of innovation by building intuitive and interactive HR systems.\n  * Encourage collaboration and open communication through modern digital tools such as an integrated HRMS, mobile modules, multi-device etc. \n  * Create a flexible and agile work environment through anytime-anywhere systems and policies. \n  * Inspire creativity by building a culture of failing fast. \n  * Help HR transform internally in capability and outlook, from a traditional process- oriented model to a futuristic people-oriented model. \n\n### Design-thinking led HR technology\n\n  * **Data-driven hiring decisions:** Design thinking can enable recruiters with data on the ideal candidate. And how he/she evaluates and compares companies and opportunities. The employer value proposition can then be fine-tuned based on these insights, to become an \u201cemployer of choice\u201d for top talent. \n  * **Experiential learning programs:** Self-learning is the way ahead for which L&D experts must better understand learners\u2019 styles, preferences, motivations and challenges, and design learning experiences that help employees excel. This means AI-assisted learner recommendations, coaching, mentoring, crowd-sharing, knowledge-sharing.\n  * **Real-time, open communication and collaboration:** Work in today\u2019s day and age is enabled in a 24x7 environment. HR Systems must support this future reality of work by granting employees easy tech access. Chatbots, messenger and chat apps, mobile modules are the way to go to foster seamless communication. \n  * **Workplace design:** Employee productivity is influenced immensely by the immediate work environment \u2013 physical and environment-wise. Different employees may value different elements in the physical workplace design such as open spaces, ergonomic arrangements etc. \n\nArtificial Intelligence can provide useful insights, while design thinking can\nhelp translate those insights to solutions.\n\n  * **PMS:** Continuous performance management tools are fast replacing annual appraisals. HR must design the PMS to encourage open dialogue (in-person and virtual), ongoing feedback conversations, periodic check-ins, three sixty degree feedback from multiple stakeholder.\n  * **R &R:** HR systems must include peer-to-peer and instant recognition, customizable compensation and benefits, and single- view for employees to stay informed on their pay and perks. \n\nDesign thinking can help fine-tune each of these HR systems, yet, the ultimate\nsynergy can be achieved only when all HR functionalities are tightly\nintegrated into a single, holistic talent management solution. Moreover, this\nHRIS must loop into the business systems, to ensure strategic business\nalignment.\n\n### Creating the ultimate talent experience\n\nHR leaders must proactively work towards curating the ultimate \u201cEmployee\nExperience Design\u201d, by reinventing the fundamentals of how work happens. While\ntechnological and digital transformation in HR is a must, sustained change is\npossible only when a cultural change prevails.\n\nAlong every stage of the HR Technology project, HR practitioners must factor\nin any inputs from the end-users, i.e. the employees whose jobs and work\nprocesses will be impacted. For this, HR itself must embrace the design-\nthinking paradigm \u2013 Empathize-Define-Ideate-Prototype-Test. If HR leaders show\nwillingness to embed Design Thinking into HR tech design, teams will be\ninspired to build talent solutions which are relevant to the real world.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Rhucha Kulkarni](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1489129443/authors/rhucha-\nkulkarni.jpg)](/author/rhucha-kulkarni)\n\n#### [Rhucha Kulkarni](/author/rhucha-kulkarni)\n\nRhucha is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The Travel Risk Outlook 2020: How can organizations ensure safety\nof traveling employees ](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-\nrelations/the-travel-risk-outlook-2020-how-can-organizations-ensure-safety-of-\ntravelling-employees-24331?page=2 \"Article: The Travel Risk Outlook 2020: How\ncan organizations ensure safety of traveling employees &ndash;

**Is Your Onboarding Strategy on Point?**\n\nHaving a stellar [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/) is critical to\n[employee retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/).\nAccording to research by Jobvite, a significant portion of your new hires is\nlikely to quit in just 90 days after joining their role. This makes the\nonboarding experience a key differentiator in how they perceive a company,\nengage with the job, and stay involved (or not) with your business objectives.\n\nAnd here are a few more metrics that drive home the need for a smart\nonboarding experience strategy. These findings are from a SilkRoad Technology\nreport titled U.S. Trends and Applications in **[Employee\nOnboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** , published earlier in 2019:\n\n  * 65% of employees say that an onboarding program helps to prepare for the next step in their career trajectory\n  * Organizations with a clearly outlined [onboarding process](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) enjoy 82% higher new employee retention, as well as a 70% uptick in productivity\n  * The average recruit must go through 54 different activities as part of their onboarding experience, suggesting a marked degree of complexity\n\n  \nAs we approach 2020, it is time to rethink the onboarding experience with a\nfocus on candidate engagement and long-term retention. Remember, the lessons\nlearned and the impressions made during these early days will be critical in\ndetermining whether top talent decides to stay on with your company.\n\nAn intelligent onboarding experience strategy, informed by a set of key best\npractices, will help you maximize each new resource that becomes part of your\nworkforce. Let\u2019s look at how to improve the onboarding experience in 2020,\nwith trends and examples to illustrate the way forward.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **How to Improve the Onboarding Experience: 10 Strategies to Remember**\n\nThe world\u2019s leading companies are now squarely focused on delivering the best\nonboarding experiences possible. Interestingly, this goes beyond the offer\nacceptance and joining stage \u2013 from the moment a candidate seriously considers\nyour organization as a potential employer, you should focus on having a\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** strategy that\ntranslates into a stellar onboarding experience. Here are ten tips to help\nimprove your onboarding experience in 2020, minimizing early [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)and disengagement risks.\n\n![10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new\nhires](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new hires**\n\n### **1\\. Make learning & development (L&D;) central to the onboarding\nexperience **\n\n  \nOnboarding is all about equipping a recruit to bring their very best to a\nworkplace from day one. If they spend weeks or even months familiarizing\nthemselves with your company, exploring self-service capabilities, and\nfiguring out how to complete routine tasks, they are being far less productive\nthan they can be.\n\nThis is why L&D; is vital for an enriched onboarding experience \u2013 learning\nmodules on essential software, short one-on-one sessions with a line manager,\nand pre-recorded videos on company values/ethics can go a long way in helping\nrecruits overcome their teething troubles.\n\nFor example, U.S.-based Hormel Foods Corporation adopted this strategy to\nredesign onboarding experiences in 2019. It deployed a gamified platform\ncalled Discovery Map\u00ae to allow new hires to learn information about the\ncompany quickly. This earned them the Silver Stevie Award in the Achievement\nin New Employee Onboarding category in 2019 as one of the best onboarding\nexperiences.\n\n### **2\\. Find innovative ways to inspire collaboration**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s no way around it. Collaboration is the cornerstone of engagement, and\nby inspiring recruits to collaborate with the workforce from day one, you can\nsubstantially improve the onboarding experience. There are many ways to do\nthis. For example, by scheduling an \"Onboarding Day\" every month/two months\ndepending on the size of your company, you can urge recruits to talk, share\ninsights, and resolve any concerns they may have about their future workplace.\n\nFor single-recruit onboarding experiences, you can invite participation from\nvarious stakeholders across the company, including team leads, vertical heads,\nand even C-level executives. Problem-solving exercises, quizzes, and\nquestionnaires are a great way to embed collaboration into your onboarding\nexperience.\n\nOne of the best onboarding experiences that leverages this collaborative model\nis practiced by Pinterest. The company\u2019s Knit SF onboarding strategy follows\nthe principles of knitting \u2013 using the term to refer to the collaboration of\npeople across the organization during the onboarding process. Activities like\npeer-to-peer icebreakers, candid chats with cross-disciplinary team leaders,\nand joining the company\u2019s Slack thread fall under this Knit SF framework. New\nhires are taken through all the departments of the organization to understand\nhow each function.\n\nIt also helps that despite having offices across the world, all new hires at\nPinterest begin their onboarding experience at the San Francisco headquarters.\n\n**Also Read:** **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n### **3\\. Drive hiring managers to take greater ownership of the onboarding\nprocess**\n\n  \nBecause the onboarding experience involves multiple stakeholders across the\ncompany, there\u2019s always the risk that hiring managers may overlook a few key\ndetails. This challenge is compounded by the fact that onboarding is only one\ncomponent of a hiring manager's daily itinerary.\n\nAn excellent way to address this is by creating **[onboarding\nchecklists](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/)** that clearly lay out all the\nsteps required to improve the onboarding experience. Organizational leaders\ncan work together with the internal marketing team to schedule email updates\nthat inform and inspire hiring managers to take ownership.\n\nFor example, Google sends a manager \u201cjust in time\u201d onboarding checklists to\nassist with the onboarding experience. The company shares this list only 24\nhours before the recruit\u2019s arrival, ensuring a sense of immediacy and urgency.\nSome of these tasks on this list include having discussions with the new hire,\nassigning them a peer buddy, building a social network, setting up regular\ncheck-ins, and having transparent dialogues to identify how they feel about\nworking there.\n\nWith only one day to prepare, the manager is more likely to remember and focus\non each component. This small change to Google's onboarding experience\nstrategy improved results from onboarding by 25%.\n\n### **4\\. Integrate all the touchpoints on the employee onboarding journey**\n\n  \nAs mentioned, the typical employee must go through numerous activities and\nprotocols before they can complete the onboarding process. This can sometimes\nbe a fragmented experience, lowering the recruit's capability to remember and\nact on the information gained during onboarding. Integration of onboarding\ntouchpoints such as L&D;, admin, compliance, and workforce management could\nhelp to improve the onboarding experience significantly.\n\nFor example, instead of providing multiple hard copies for photographs for\ndocumentation, and then receiving an employee ID, the recruit can take a\nselfie or share a digital photo that\u2019s reused across various departments. Not\nonly does this dramatically cut down the onboarding timeline, but it also\nenhances the overall quality of experience.\n\nDell Boomi recognized the impact of this onboarding experience strategy after\nsurveying its employees last year. It found that 74% of the workforce didn\u2019t\nreceive a laptop on day one, and it took an average of 92 days before gaining\naccess to key applications and information.\n\nSo, the company developed an Onboarding Solution Accelerator that could\nresolve fragmentation in onboarding experiences by leveraging remote access,\nmobile competencies, and automation. Thanks to what is one of the best\nonboarding experiences we have seen so far, Dell saved 3.4 hours in admin\neffort per recruit and $5,600 in annual costs.\n\n### **5\\. Initiate the onboarding experience before the recruit steps into the\noffice**\n\n  \nEvery recruiter has undoubtedly come across this scenario: after a rigorous\nscreening process and negotiations, the offer is rolled out and accepted. But\nthe recruit changes their mind a few days before the joining date. This leads\nto massive sunk costs and overall inefficiency in your talent acquisition\npipeline.\n\nTo address this, it is crucial to extend the onboarding experience beyond the\noffice premises. By engaging with the recruit immediately after the offer\nacceptance, you can alleviate everyday worries (commute, career progressions,\ndiversity, etc.) and ensure that they do not look for greener pastures\nelsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s why preboarding is now among the top onboarding experience strategies\nfor employers across the globe.\n\nWhen a high-tech electronics firm saw that an increasing number of recruits\nwere dropping off after receiving an offer, they started thinking about how to\nimprove the onboarding experience for their new hires.\n\nOne of the measures it took was designing a preboarding package that was\nmailed to the employee\u2019s home address. It included a company video,\ntestimonials by future colleagues, and detailed descriptions of the benefits\nthey could expect at the company.\n\nOnboarding experience best practices like this ensure that a recruit stays\nengaged with your organization until every formality has been completed.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Do You Measure These 5 Onboarding\nMetrics?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)\n\n### **6\\. Analyze the unique needs of varying recruit demographics**\n\n  \nThis is one of the key steps to improving your onboarding experience \u2013 not\nevery recruit will come with similar expectations, and the onboarding\nexperience cannot follow a one-size-fits-all model. There may be instances\nwhere engagement and community building should be at the forefront of the\nonboarding process.\n\nIn other cases, the experience should ideally pivot around the exchange and\ndissemination of information. Employers should conduct preboarding surveys to\ndetect these requirements early on, ensuring that the onboarding experience is\nin line with the recruit\u2019s individualized expectations.\n\nKPMG Belgium demonstrated a great example of this onboarding experience\nstrategy in action. The organization hires 170 graduates every year, in\naddition to 150 experienced hires. KPMG leveraged a combination of preboarding\npractices, content delivery systems, and process automation to improve the\nonboarding experience for these two unique categories.\n\nGiven that the cost of replacing a new graduate recruit could run up to 80% of\ntheir annual salary, you must try to deliver the best possible onboarding\nexperience to these young, ambitious professionals.\n\n### **7\\. Explore onboarding models for temporary and seasonal workers**\n\n  \nThe quality of the onboarding experience is as important for your temporary\nand seasonal workers as it is for employees joining the permanent company\npayroll. For sectors such as media and entertainment, retail, and healthcare,\nthe contingent workforce takes up a large part of their onboarding\ninvestments.\n\nA more efficient and optimized experience in this segment can help to deliver\nbetter results and save costs. It isn\u2019t enough to have temporary and seasonal\nworkers sign an offer and join the job \u2013 these are individuals who will be\nadvocates for your employer brand, who can effectively promote it to hire more\nworkers \u2013 even urgently if needed.\n\nA paper-based non-experience-focused onboarding journey brings down the\npossibility of a temporary worker choosing to work for you a second time\naround.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (Denver) offers one of the best onboarding\nexperiences to its massive group of seasonal workers who join every year to\nstaff their summer camp. The company initially had a paper-driven, manual\nprocess where HR would go through every file to identify returning staff and\ncreate new folders for fresh recruits. This process took weeks to complete.\n\nBoy Scouts of America recently switched to an automated onboarding process\nthat doesn't require recruits to be physically present to furnish the\npaperwork. Owing to this new onboarding experience, the organization saved 48+\nhours in admin efforts and ensured a happier contingent workforce.\n\n### **8\\. Harmonize onboarding experiences across multiple locations**\n\n  \nProviding a consistent onboarding experience has always been a challenge for\nglobal/large-scale companies. Once the\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** process and offer rollout are over,\nregional offices follow their own practices until the recruit joins the\norganization. This could lead to a fragmented experience, dependent on the\ninterest and expertise level of local HR managers.\n\nTo achieve the same level of success across locations, it is essential to\nformulate a clear onboarding experience roadmap with strategic checks and\nbalances in place. This will also make it easier to introduce changes/upgrades\nto your onboarding model without requiring any major overhaul at each\nlocation.\n\nGlobal beverages company Bacardi provides a great example of this onboarding\nstrategy at work. Previously, Bacardi struggled with a different experience at\neach site, risking inefficient onboarding journeys at locations that were\nunderstaffed.\n\nTo improve the onboarding experience, the company now uses pulse surveys to\nshare and collect data over a 90-day welcome period. A buddy system and\nmandatory training are the other components of Bacardi\u2019s global onboarding\nprocess, which creates a seamless onboarding experience no matter where\nemployees join the company.\n\n### **9\\. Blend employee onboarding with continuous learning**\n\n  \nThe transition from the onboarding process (which can last from anywhere\nbetween two days and three months) to on-the-job practice, must be seamless.\nIt can be beneficial to measure employee skills at the time of joining and map\nhow it improves over time via onboarding as well as continuous learning.\n\nThe concept of **[strategic\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategic-onboarding-plan-2019/)** involves the \u201ccontinuous\nonboarding\u201d of employees \u2013 a long-term strategy to keep employees engaged and\nrelevant for new positions within the company. It can even prepare them for\nleadership positions in the future. This can help you boost productivity and\nhelp employees reach their professional targets faster.\n\nO\u2019Shea Builders uses this onboarding tactic to raise the quality of talent in\nthe organization over time. At O\u2019Shea, onboarding and career development are\npart of the same process, guiding each employee through organizational and\ncareer goals. This is broken down into a two-part onboarding process, where\nthe first deals with new hire training and the second ask employees to define\nspecific development goals for themselves.\n\nThanks to customizable workflows and trackable progress, 83% of employees at\nO\u2019Shea Builders reported they were very satisfied with the onboarding and\ncareer development experience at the company.\n\n### **10\\. Factor in offboarding requirements right at the time of\nonboarding**\n\n  \nWith the average employment tenure gradually shrinking, your offboarding\nnumbers are likely to go up over the years. And the impressions made during\nthis crucial part of the employee journey will determine if they return to\nyour company, refer their acquaintances, and present your employer brand on\nsocial media.\n\nIt is advisable to take the data gathered during onboarding to frame an\nindividualized offboarding strategy. Apart from standard procedures in\ncompliance and admin areas, pulse surveys, one-on-one conversations, and a\ndiscussion on future opportunities are critical to offboarding.\n\nFor example, email automation startup Mailigen places offboarding at the heart\nof its employee-centric culture. The company realized that ineffective\noffboarding could result in sizeable costs, as rehiring an ex-employee is\noften better for business than looking for a new one. That\u2019s why Mailigen\ntreats the employee journey like any other relationship, where the\norganization must take care of first impressions, regular interactions, as\nwell as the closure to ensure the employer brand is maintained.\n\nThis is in addition to following the other onboarding experience strategies\nlisted above, including integration, collaboration, and an unwavering eye on\nengagement.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)\n\n## **Avoid These Pitfalls When Onboarding in 2020**\n\nThere are still a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out when it comes to improving\nonboarding experiences. Research by ServiceNow found that nearly a quarter of\nemployees receive no clear onboarding, and the company didn't note that it was\nan employee's first day in one out of ten cases.\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to learn how to improve onboarding experiences and deliver the\nbest onboarding experience to your 2020 recruits, make sure to avoid these\ncommon pitfalls:\n\n  * No alignment between onboarding and the reality of the job\n  * Giving the recruit full ownership for the first day, with zero handholding\n  * Setting performance benchmarks that become active without a transition period\n  * Information overload and exposure to a high number of technology platforms\n\n  \nSo these are among the top onboarding experience strategies that belong on\nyour radar as you look forward to a new year, marked by hiring success and\ncontinued engagement. As exemplified by these ten companies with the best\nonboarding experiences, the early days of an employee\u2019s journey are probably\nthe most formative, setting up the groundwork for a productive tenure at your\ncompany.\n\n_What measures have you taken to improve onboarding experiences in 2020?

the right employees is important, but keeping them around and happy is\njust as essential. One way to do that is to provide opportunities for\nprofessional development and training as a way to encourage workers to improve\ntheir skills and engage further with their jobs.  \n  \nWhile you likely have a solid training program for new employees to get them\naccustomed to your organization, the training options for ongoing employees\nare often more limited.  \n\nIt's always a good idea to encourage all employees to continue learning new\nskills, perfecting old ones and developing as professionals. Having well-\nrounded workers with a range of skills boosts your business and opens up\nopportunities for their advancement.\n\nBeyond making workers happier and more productive, there are revenue benefits\nassociated with comprehensive training, too.\n\nCompanies that offer workers training programs have [24% higher profit margins\nthan those that don't,](http://businesstrainingexperts.com/knowledge-\ncenter/training-roi/profiting-from-learning/) according to the American\nSociety for Training and Development.\n\nAnd if you don't yet have a[ learning management system (LMS)\nsolution](https://www.betterbuys.com/lms/), consider investing in one. It can\nhelp streamline the training process and strengthen your entire program while\noffering a range of other benefits.\n\nWhether you already have a training program you're looking to improve, or\nyou're aiming to implement one, there are certain elements every successful\ntraining and development program has.\n\n## Short, specific sessions\n\nYou know better than anyone that employees' attention spans aren't long. No\none wants to sit through hours of training, no matter how valuable the\ninformation is.  \n\nFocus instead on short, specific bursts of information that will interest\nworkers and guarantee they retain the information.  \n\nThis strategy, called microlearning, emphasizes brief (usually three to five\nminutes) sessions designed to meet specific outcomes. You can use it for both\nformal training and informal, but it's generally more successful when applied\nto informal skills training instead of intense or complex processed-based\ntraining.  \n\nThere are four essential characteristics of microlearning to hone in on. Make\nsure your training is:\n\n    * **Lean:** It shouldn't need a mob of people to implement\n    *  **Adaptable:** There should be ways to apply the training to many employees across a range of departments and locations. Although specificity is a key component of microlearning, it can't be so specific that only one employee will benefit, otherwise it's not worth the time and resources.\n    *  **Simple:** Avoid over-complicating things and confusing workers.\n    *  **Seamless:** Use the technology at your disposal. Your solution shouldn't require in-person sit-downs, but instead should be transferable to employees' mobile devices and laptops when possible.\n\nMany LMS solutions are accessible on mobile devices and desktops and allow you\nto create your own courses to provide the exact content you want to employees.  \n\nRemember: Microlearning doesn't have to be the centerpiece of your training\nprogram. After all, there are some topics that simply can't be condensed into\nbite-sized pieces. But integrating this method can help spice up your program\nand supply a new way of doing things.\n\n## Assessments\n\n[An effective training program](https://www.betterbuys.com/lms/5-elements-of-\nan-effective-employee-training-program/) is only as good as what employees\nretain, so you'll want a way to measure where they started and how the\ntraining has impacted them.  \n\nA pre-training assessment can also shine light on what workers are looking for\nand what they still need to learn. This allows you to target specific skills\ntraining and development to the employees who need it, while not wasting the\ntime of workers who're all caught up.  \n\nPost-training assessments, meanwhile, help you see who's mastered the training\nand who still needs help. They can also show you where your training program\ncould be improved.  \n\nTo ensure assessments are as helpful as possible:\n\n    * Avoid yes or no questions, instead allowing workers to provide a variety of feedback.\n    * Look over how the training objectives line up with workers' perceptions of their professional development.\n    * Offer both task- and skill-based evaluations that look at performance and adaptation of the skill, rather than memorization ability.\n\nNote: These evaluations don't need to take the form of traditional tests. Very\nfew people enjoy taking tests, so taking the time to turn assessments into a\ngame or more fun activity encourages workers to participate and provide their\nhonest opinions without worrying about being \"graded.\"  \n\nWith some LMS solutions, assessments can be taken online with the information\nstored right where you can access it easily. Often, you can also compile the\nresults into reports that give you at-a-glance clarity on who benefited most\nfrom the training and who still needs improvement.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nProviding chances for your workers to interact and form connections has\nmultiple benefits for your training program and organization at large.  \nWhen employees have bonds with their co-workers, [they're more engaged in\ntheir tasks and more productive.](http://www.hrmorning.com/15-ways-recognize-\nreward-employees/)\n\nGetting them to collaborate during training can help convince them to take the\ncourse seriously while encouraging teamwork beyond the training.  \n\nCollaboration tools, such as built-in messaging systems and discussion boards,\nare prevalent among LMS solutions and give workers the chance to learn\ntogether and develop along the same paths.\n\n## Multimedia options\n\nYou'll also want to expand your horizons beyond basic text-based training.\nWe're living in an age with constantly evolving technology, and your training\nprogram should take advantage of the options at your disposal.  \n\nWorkers will be more engaged with the content you offer if it's more than\nwords on a page. And with LMS solutions, creating and importing multimedia\ncontent into your training is easier than ever.  \n\nThis doesn't mean you can't implement text into your training, of course, but\nrather that you should also have:\n\n    * [video](http://www.hrmorning.com/business-bares-all-for-training-video/)\n    * interactive content\n    * images, and\n    * audio.\n\nVideo and images are already extremely popular in training, and if you have a\ncurrent program it's likely there are already videos and photos in it. Don't\nforget about graphs and other diagrams that could help clarify certain\nconcepts.  \n\nInteractive content can take a range of forms, from quizzes given to workers\nafter each module to games employees play to help them retain the information\nthey've learned.  \n\nThese games can also increase collaboration during training, which helps\nparticipants stay engaged in what they're learning and form connections with\nco-workers. Bonding with co-workers is one of the benefits offered by in-house\ntraining programs and these bonds often strengthen employee engagement with\nyour company.  \n\nAnother option is audio content, like podcasts. Offering audio content allows\nworkers to train while performing other tasks, since they don't have to be in\na specific room or looking at something to follow along.  \n\nIf you're worried about carving enough time out in employees' workdays to [add\ntraining](http://www.hrmorning.com/cross-training-todays-answer-to-getting-\nthe-most-out-of-your-workforce/) or professional development, podcasts and\nother audio content are a good bridge to get them learning new skills while\nstill able to complete their jobs.\n\n## Easy access\n\n[A training program won't work if its\ninaccessible.](http://www.hrmorning.com/think-your-employees-hate-training-\nthink-again/) If workers have to show up on a specific day and time to a\ncertain conference room, it's significantly less likely they'll take you up on\nthe offer.  \n\nAnd if the training is mandatory, employees won't be excited to learn and may\nresist absorbing the info.  \n\nThis is where an LMS solution comes in handy the most. It provides a central\nlocation for training and courses to be stored and accessed. Workers can check\nout training from all of their devices and tackle the topics individually or\nin groups, depending on what works best for them.  \n\nHaving an LMS solution also helps if you employ remote workers or have\nmultiple locations, since you don't have to coordinate a time for them to come\nin or run multiple training sessions at once.\n\n## Professional development\n\nWorkers, especially younger ones, want a way forward in their careers. They\ndon't want to just learn skills applicable to their current jobs. They want\noptions and the chance to develop further and pick up skills that will serve\nthem well as they advance.  \n\nClearly define how your training program will factor in [professional\ndevelopment](http://www.hrmorning.com/professional-development-positively-\neffects-engagement-and-retention-study-says/), so employees can see what the\npayoff will be down the line. This also motivates them to stay with your\ncompany in the long run, since you're enabling them to develop and practice\nnew abilities and investing in their futures.  \n\nMost LMS solutions have the ability to create customized learning paths\ndepending on where employees are in their careers and what they're aiming to\nlearn and accomplish.  \n\nLaying out the ways forward can also help with [recruiting and\nhiring,](http://www.hrmorning.com/ats-analytical-insights-recruiting-\nsoftware/) since prospective employees can see the opportunities for\nadvancement and growth available to them.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nTraining matters for every employee, not just new hires or recent transfers. A\nstrong comprehensive training program is essential to building up your\nworkforce and keeping workers engaged in their jobs.  \n\nWhen given the chance to boost their skills and develop professionally,\nemployees are also happier and more productive, making the potential expense\nof implementing training programs worth it.  \n\nPlus, LMS solutions can help [improve your\ntraining](http://www.hrmorning.com/case-study-training-initiative-brought-us-\ninto-the-digital-age/) and offer a variety of features to employees and\ntrainers alike in a cost-effective way.  \n\nYour training doesn't have to reinvent the wheel to be helpful for your\nworkers and provide benefits for your business. It just has to work for your\ncompany and employees.\n\n[![Coronavirus & Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Coronavirus\n& Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HRM-coronavirus-\nwebinar-1.png)](https://www.learningpremier.com/product/coronavirus-influenza-\nobligations-under-fmla-ada-title-vii-\nmore/?utm_source=hrmorning&utm_medium=display&utm_content=8170&utm_campaign=coronavirus-03-31-2020)\n\n#### Keep Up To Date with the Latest HR News\n\nWith HRMorning arriving in your inbox, you will never miss critical stories on\nlabor laws, benefits, retention and onboarding strategies.\n\nSign up for a free HRMorning membership and get our newsletter!\n\n    * Email*\n\n    * username*\n\n    * formOffer\n\n    * businessUnit\n\n    * businessUnitId\n\n    * brand\n\n    * brandId\n\n    * event*\n\n    * controlCode\n\n    * Comments\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n[ ![HR Morning\nLogo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![HR\nMorning Logo](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/genesis/assets/images/logo-white@2x.png) ]()\n\n    * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4898679/)\n\n    * [ABOUT HRMORNING](https://www.hrmorning.com/about/)\n    * [ADVERTISE WITH US](https://www.hrmorning.com/advertise-with-us/)\n    * [WRITE FOR US](https://www.hrmorning.com/write-for-hr-morning/)\n    * [CONTACT](https://www.hrmorning.com/contact/)\n\n    * [Employment Law](/pbp-categories/employment-law/)\n    * [Benefits](/pbp-categories/benefits/)\n    * [Recruiting](/pbp-categories/recruiting/)\n    * [Talent Management](/pbp-categories/talent-management/)\n    * [HR Technology](/pbp-categories/hr-technology/)\n    * [Performance Management](/pbp-categories/performance-management/)\n    * [Leadership & Strategy](/pbp-categories/leadership-strategy/)\n    * [Compensation & Payroll](/pbp-categories/compensation-payroll)\n    * [Policy & Culture](/pbp-categories/policy-culture/)\n    * [Staff Administration](/pbp-categories/staff-administration/)\n    * [Wellness & Safety](/pbp-categories/wellness-safety/)\n    * [Staff Departure](/pbp-categories/staff-departure/)\n    * [Employee Services](/pbp-categories/employee-services/)\n    * [Work Location](/pbp-categories/work-location/)\n    * [HR Career & Self-Care](/pbp-categories/hr-career/)\n\nHRMorning, part of the Catalyst Media Network, provides the latest HR and\nemployment law news for HR professionals in the trenches of small-to-medium-\nsized businesses.

Read to know how Zimyo plans to utilize the recently\nraised money and spearhead the segment of HR SuperApps, which Mayank believes\nwould be the biggest trend of 2020.\n\n![Zimyo\u2019s Founder on employee experience &amp; HR tech trends\n2020](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1582462486/1582462485.jpg)\n\nWhen Kumar Mayank along with Ajay Kadyan started\n[Zimyo](https://www.zimyo.com/ \"Zimyo\") in 2017, they had just one focus \u2013\nmake HR more \u2018human\u2019 for all employees. They thought in a country that is so\nemployer-centric and hierarchy-obsessed, it is hard for employees to find\npurpose and fulfilment in work life.\n\n> Mayank shared in an exclusive interaction with People Matters, \u201cWe believe,\n> organizations who fail to care for their employees would not stay relevant\n> in an era where business thrives on \u2018experience\u2019.\u201d And by experience he\n> doesn\u2019t mean only \u2018customer experience\u2019, but also \u2018employee experience\u2019.\n\nMost recently, the Gurugram-based HR Tech startup Zimyo, _**raised an\nundisclosed amount of funding from Yatra Angel Network (YAN) **_and other\nangel investors. Zimyo was also one of the participants of the **People\nMatters TechHR Startup Program** in 2018.\n\nBack then they had shared that their aim is to provide cost-effective,\ninnovative and configurable ERP solutions for startups or small and medium-\nsized businesses. Now the scope of the vision for Zimyo has gone beyond. The\nfirm now envisions to create a world where employees are empowered for a\nbetter work life.\n\nZimyo today calls itself an Employee Experience Platform that allows employee-\ncentric organizations to offer one-of-a-kind workplace experience to their\nemployees with modern HR Solutions like \u2013 Continuous Employee Feedback,\nSurveys and Polls, Life-cycle Management, etc. and Financial benefits like \u2014\nPayday loans, Medical Insurance, Tax Saving Investments, among other.\n\nPeople Matters interviewed Zimyo\u2019s Founder Kumar Mayank after its latest round\nof funding. Here are the excerpts of the interview:\n\n### How has Zimyo's solution grown since its inception in 2017?\n\nWe started as a typical HR & Payroll SaaS, but over the past couple of years\nwe now have over more than 18 different modules that makes us one of the most\ncomprehensive HRMS SaaS companies. We have recently added our FinTech bouquet\nof solutions, that allows us to offer employee loans and insurance to all the\nemployees on our platform.\n\n### How has the traction been so far?\n\nCurrently, 32,000 employees are using the platform, and we are just getting\nstarted. There are over 40 crore employees in India, and 45 percent of them\nare from small and medium businesses (with <2,000 employees). We want to help\neach one of them. And we want to help the businesses become better versions of\nthemselves with global HR processes in place and employee focus in mind.\n\nFor a bootstrapped startup for two years in the market, I think we are doing\npretty great!\n\n### What are your thoughts on the recent round of funding? How are you\nplanning to utilize the money raised?\n\nThe funds would primarily be utilized for \u2018increasing the Product Offerings\u2019\nand expanding operations geographically. We will also focus on building the\nsales team in these different geographies.\n\n### How do you think the HR tech space will evolve in 2020?\n\n2020 would see a lot of convergence in the Indian HR Tech space.\n\n> I am assuming a lot of vertical SaaS players serving a niche domain like\n> LMS, Engagement, etc would either be acquired or offered merger as hyper\n> funded HR Tech players would be aggressive on employee acquisition.\n\nAs a big advocate of product play (rather than the service play that exists in\nthe Indian subcontinent), I am assuming service play will finally lose it\nsteam in 2020 and we will finally see product focused SaaS HR tech startups\ngaining momentum.\n\nThis could also be the year of HR SuperApps, the likes of what we see in\nmonopolies. We at Zimyo, definitely want to spearhead this segment with our\nrecently launched HR FinTech solutions.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Technology](/category/technology-\noutsourcing/technology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=technology \"Browse\nmore in: Technology\"),\n[#WorkTech](/tag/worktech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=worktech \"Browse\nmore in: WorkTech\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

The survey report reveals the reasons why managers stay\nloyal to their companies, and what makes them consider leaving.  \n\nThese are the key findings:\n\n  * 1 in 2 managers are thinking about leaving their company in the next 12 months\n  * 7 in 10 say they feel undervalued and underpaid\n  * 43% feel isolated at work after they became managers\n  * 61% say that the number one reason they stay is that they work well with the people they manage\n\nThe top factors that drive managers away, besides being underpaid, are: an\nunhealthy working environment, not being part of the decision-making process,\nand insufficient training and development opportunities.  \n\nOn the other hand, among the top reasons why managers stay at their current\ncompanies, besides compensation, are: the people they manage (61%), decision-\nmaking power (49%), work-life balance (44%), feeling acknowledged (37%), and\ntraining opportunities (36%).  \n\nThe report also looked into whether managers feel taken care of. As it turns\nout, 93% have a go-to person, while 7% say they have no one to rely on at\nwork. But Dr. Prisant raises an important point here:\n\n_\u201cShould others be taking care of managers?

Let\u2019s dive right in.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Learning and\nDevelopment**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-in-learning-and-development/)\n\n## **Soft Skills to Thrive as a Learning and Development Professional in\n2020**\n\nA learning and development career requires a smart combination of hard and\nsoft skills. Soft skills play a critical role in one\u2019s ability to aid\nworkforce learning and development.\n\nSome of the key soft skills you need in 2020 include:\n\n### **1\\. Empathy with learning clients**\n\n  \nLearning experts are often tasked with pinpointing the exact needs of their\n\u201cclient.\u201d The learning client within an organization could be a group of\ninterns, a specific department, such as sales, or individual employees in\nsenior positions.\n\nA learning and development professional must be able to empathize with the\nclient and discover learning needs that learners may not know they had.\n\nFor example, the sales team might require training sessions to boost sales\nrevenues. On the surface, a session on selling best practices could seem\nenough. But through empathy-led conversations, you may discover that the sales\nreps aren\u2019t conversant with the product\u2019s value proposition, which is holding\nback communication with the customer.\n\nThis can help you modify your training strategies and create a specific,\npersonalized program for these sales reps.\n\n### **2\\. Superior communication skills**\n\n  \nLearning experts must regularly communicate with various stakeholders across\nthe organization to pinpoint upskilling requirements, obtain buy-in, and\neliminate bottlenecks. Frequently, they must talk to employees/employee groups\nabout their skills gaps, and how they can be addressed.\n\nTherefore, a learning and development professional must be interested in and\nequipped to hold meaningful conversations about key issues.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a diverse and multigenerational workforce means that you need to\nadapt to different attitudes, perspectives, and approaches when communicating\nwith others. This makes self-confidence, communication, and heightened empathy\nessential skills to have.\n\n### **3\\. Teamwork and conflict resolution**\n\n  \nIn the course of their career, learning and development professionals will\noften have to resolve conflicts or find common ground with stakeholders with\nconflicting interests.\n\nFor example, a senior employee may be tasked with a mission-critical project\nwith a stringent deadline. But stakeholders from a different discipline may\nhave asked the employee to prioritize cross-skilling for that quarter.\n\nAs a learning and development manager, you would have to step in and resolve\nthe issue. You may have to speak to all stakeholders involved and find out\nwhat can be deprioritized.\n\nSimilarly, teamwork is a vital part of designing employee development\nstrategies. It is only by working with multiple stakeholders that you can\nformulate a learning plan that addresses every business need as well as the\nemployee's targets. ****\n\n### **4\\. Innovation/change readiness**\n\n  \nThe field of learning and development is rapidly evolving, and experts are\nexpected to keep up. From the introduction of **[learning management systems\n(LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/)** in the early 2000s to the proliferation of\nmobile learning, self-learning for career progress via MOOCs, and now the\n**[learning experience platform\n(LXP)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-your-lms/)** , the\nindustry has witnessed several changes.\n\nThe priorities and perspectives of adult learners have changed as well. Beyond\njust job-related training, people are now eager to obtain cross-disciplinary\nskills and strengthen their employability.\n\nAs a learning and development professional, you must understand and guide\nlearners/organizations through these change waves, maximizing the outcome from\neach new opportunity. Innovation-readiness will also aid in problem-solving,\nhelping to meet tricky targets and formulate out-of-the-box learning\nstrategies.\n\n### **5\\. A Shoshin mindset**\n\n  \nShoshin is a soft skill derived from Zen Buddhism that could prove\ninstrumental for your learning and development career. The word Shoshin\nessentially means \u201cthe beginner\u2019s mind,\u201d indicating one\u2019s openness to new\nideas and possibilities.\n\nEquipped with a Shoshin mindset, you will be able to identify compelling\nsolutions, articulate clearly why specific learning solutions might be\nineffective, and listen carefully to the voice of the employee. Shoshin is\nparticularly useful when adopting new technologies, as it ensures that you\nbegin with a blank slate, without any attitudinal impediments or past\ndependencies.\n\n### **6\\. Strategic vision and foresight**\n\n  \nThis is among the top soft skill requirements for any professional today, and\nit applies to learning and development careers as well.\n\nForesight can help to assess past patterns and predict how your ongoing\nlearning strategies could work out in the future. It will allow you to\nanticipate roadblocks on the way and deploy preventive/corrective actions if\nrequired.\n\nTake a simple example of a freshly graduated software developer undergoing\nsoft skills training. From previous experience, you know that this specific\nrole has traditionally relied on hard skills. The software developer may\nbecome overwhelmed by the demands of interpersonal communication after two\nmonths of the course.\n\nTo address this, you preemptively build a community of past learners who have\ntaken the course and have obtained the certification, allowing the young\nemployee to gain from more experienced peers.\n\nAs the example suggests, foresight goes hand in hand with strategic vision, so\nthat you can take the appropriate corrective action. ****\n\n## **Hard Skills You Need in Your Learning and Development Career in 2020**\n\nIn addition to empathy, communication, teamwork, foresight, change-readiness,\nand a Shoshin mindset, you also need the necessary hard skills to execute your\nlearning vision effectively. This boils down to the following four hard\nskills:\n\n### **7\\. Instructional design**\n\n  \nInstructional design was always a foundational requirement for aspiring\nlearning and development professionals. And it continues to be highly\nrelevant, especially in the early stages of your career.\n\nInstructional design is the ability to conceptualize, create, and deliver\nproducts/experiences that inform the learner. This hard skill spans\ninstructional videos, infographics, PowerPoint presentations, animations, and\na host of other visual formats.\n\nThere are several models and industry standards for instructional design, as\nwell as platforms such as Adobe Captivate and Articulate 360 geared to\ngenerate instructional content. This skill is also commonly known as\ne-learning authoring.\n\n### **8\\. Adult learning technologies**\n\n  \nAdult learning technology is a rapidly growing market, with several learning\nchannels for you to choose from. Investing in the right channel can be game-\nchanging for companies looking to upskill/reskill their workforces within a\nshort period.\n\nAn understanding of adult learning technologies, how they work, their pros and\ncons, and implementation processes can help you further your learning and\ndevelopment career.\n\nSome of the most popular adult learning technologies in use today include\nopen-source/paid LMS, blended learning (which has a human element), micro-\ncredentials, incentivized learning via digital badges, etc. Learning experts\nmust know all about these possibilities and shape the best-fit technology\nroadmap for workforce development.\n\n### **9\\. Human behavioral science**\n\n  \nWhile communication and teamwork may appear to be enough, \u201chard\u201d knowhow of\nbehavioral science and how it applies to human development is essential.\n\nEmployee learning and development is determined heavily by neuroscience and\nbehavioral science. Traits such as attention span, memory formation, and\npersonal habits play a critical role in how human beings imbibe and retain\nknowledge. By applying behavioral science theory, you can help employees\novercome the forgetting curve and make sure that your learning investments\nyield the desired results.\n\nApart from neuroscience, there is a specific field called the science of\nlearning and development, which offers useful insights into the learning\nprocess across various stages of an employee\u2019s personal and professional\ndevelopment.\n\nRooted in psychology, this hard skill can help you outline effective\nstrategies that factor in the human variance in learning experiences \u2013\nparticularly useful when combined with the study of adult learning\ntechnologies.\n\n### **10\\. Learning KPI management**\n\n  \nLearning KPI management is a branch of business analysis and basic data\nscience, which equips learning professionals to monitor, measure, and track\nkey performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nLearning KPIs can vary widely from company to company, even from one team to\nanother. Hard skills in learning data management and KPI analysis will help to\npinpoint the most relevant indices to measure learning progress.\n\nKPI skills are a useful tool in your learning and development career, as you\ncan use KPI dashboards to steer learning strategies in the right direction and\nobtain buy-in from senior leadership.\n\nKPIs convey the benefits of learning to non-HR business leaders in a tangible\nformat, clearly demonstrating its role in the overall organizational pathway.\n\nKnowledge of interpreting and analyzing data to assess, for example, where\nindividuals drop out in courses can support the skill of foresight you need to\ndevelop to prevent such situations further.\n\nMost learning and development tools available in the market today generate a\nplethora of data points, which can be analyzed with the requisite skill set.\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n## **Final #ProTip: Network at Learning and Development Events to Advance Your\nCareer**\n\nIn addition to having the right skill sets and meeting the requisite\neligibility criteria, forging meaningful relationships with industry peers can\nalso give you a leg up in your learning and development career.\n\nFortunately, social media platforms such as LinkedIn provide an exciting forum\nto exchange ideas with the world\u2019s leading learning professionals.\n\nThis paves the way to gain referrals for future positions (LinkedIn even has\nan \u201cask for a referral\" button). Interestingly, nearly half of the hires at\nsmall businesses happen via referrals, [reports\nLinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/smb-\nattracting-top-talent). This means that the right connections can give you\nearly access to learning and development career opportunities as they open up\nin your professional network.\n\nYou can also check out learning and development events held throughout the\nyear to build even more connections:\n\n  * **Australia** \\- [Learn@Work Expo 2020](https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/edutech-australia/LearnWork-2020.stm) is held by EduTECH, bringing together leaders in workplace learning and adult learning technologies across the region. It is an annual event, part of the EduTech 2020 Congress Learning Streams.  \n\n  * **U.K.** \\- [World of Learning Summit](https://www.learnevents.com/conference-programme-world-of-learning-summit-2020/) is scheduled for May 15, 2020, in London. It explores the various technology and strategic tenets of workplace learning and is now open for registration along with the full event agenda.   \n\n  * **U.S.** \\- [ATD International Conference and Expo](https://atdconference.td.org/international?) draws over 12,000 attendees from 80+ countries, making it an exciting forum for experts to network and discover new ideas. This year\u2019s event is scheduled for May 17\u201320, in Denver, Colorado.  \n\n  * **MENA** \\- [The CIPD Middle East People Conference & Awards ](https://www.cipdconference.com/)will see participation from 160+ senior HR leaders, on March 25\u201326, 2020 in Dubai. Key topics include technology, change management, employee well-being, diversity, and talent development.\n\nAs you can see, there are a range opportunities for professionals eager to\nexplore a career in learning and development, from online courses and on-site\ntraining to digital tools and networking events. By keeping an eye on the ten\nskills we discussed, you can kickstart a meaningful and lucrative learning and\ndevelopment career, taking your organization to brand new heights.\n\n_Are you interested in pursuing a career in learning and development?

Keeping them\nrequires inventive learning and development solutions (in L&D, \"development\"\nis really short for \"career development\"). Creating a total experience\npackage, from on-boarding to the C-suite, is the new focus for savvy HR\ndepartments. Employees are demanding a\n[culture](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15206-company-culture-matters-to-\nworkers.html) that fosters growth - and top employers are delivering bespoke\ndevelopment experiences as the differentiator that matters more than the\npaycheck.\n\nWhile your software firm may not compete for customers with the engineering\ncompany across town, you are both competing for the same high-tech talent.\nYour leadership training, culture and compassion are under consideration in a\ntight job market. And the need to differentiate, based on leadership growth,\nis creating a transformation across multiple industries.\n\nEmployees are hungry for the [leadership\ncoaching](https://westfallonline.com/consulting/leadership/) that can advance\ncareers, influence cultures and impact customers. Experiential learning is the\nonly way to really get that done. Because [information on\nleadership](http://bit.ly/leadershiplanguage) is everywhere - but _studying_\nleadership isn't the same as delivering it.\n\n[WDHB](http://wdhb.com) has run offsite leadership events for 30 years,\nprimarily in Europe, and they've recently been expanding in the U.S. They have\npioneered \"Learning Expeditions\" - tailored and curated events that bring\ntogether a diverse group of leaders, offering experiential learning\nopportunities to global organizations.\n\n**One Size That Doesn't Fit All**\n\n\"Taking an online e-course called 'Leadership Jazz,' isn't necessarily going\nto get you into the C-suite. Or keep you there,\" says Alana Vaughn-Phillips,\nan executive with WDHB in Denver. Not that online training is bad - she's\nmaking a careful distinction between leadership experience and skills-based\ntraining. [Annemie Ress](https://purplebeach.com/team/annemie-ress/), a former\nGlobal HR Director at Skype and founder of Purple Beach, agrees. \"New\ngenerations aren't into what is proposed in terms of e-learning, by most\nlearning management systems (LMS).\"\n\n\"We deliver programs in a shared way,\" Alana explains, \"where leaders see that\ntheir company cares about career growth firsthand.\" By bringing diverse\nemployees together in unique, bespoke environments, the company facilitates a\nnew experience around leadership. A big part of the learning, according to\nAlana, is [peer to\npeer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2019/08/25/peer-recognition-\nan-employee-engagement-secret-weapon/) collaboration. At WDHB, camaraderie and\nconnection is central to the overall experience.\n\n**Employees With Options**\n\nBut what about learning and development expense, when employees take that\nexperience and [go\nelsewhere](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/08/22/nine-\nareas-to-investigate-when-experiencing-high-employee-turnover/)? According to\n[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/195803/employees-really-know-\nexpected.aspx), 72% of Millennials report greater engagement when clear\nperformance goals are established. Those goals need to include what the\norganization is doing, as well as what the employee is doing, regarding\nadvancement. A career path has to be a two-way street.\n\n\"When you create a unique shared experience, that's what drives loyalty,\"\naccording to Vaughn-Phillips, \"even among employees who leave. Because, when\nyou create powerful and unique leadership development experiences, often those\nemployees come back. Your chances are higher [for retention] when you deliver\nprograms that inspire evangelists within your organization. These employees\nbuild your brand and your reputation - regardless of where their career might\ntake them.\"\n\nIndustry leaders like [Google](https://www.insider.com/coolest-perks-of-\nworking-at-google-in-2017-2017-7) and\n[Heinz](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultalbot/2019/08/24/kraft-heinz-\nembarks-on-a-culture-of-creativity/) offer exceptional experiences - from\nonsite massages to wellness training to free food. But you don't have to be a\nfamous-name company in order to attract the best and brightest. Investing in\ninnovative programs for experiential learning is easier than you might think -\nand facilitating these retreats can be the first step to [elevate your team\nmembers](https://3 Ways Successful People Eliminate Conflict And Inspire\nTeams).\n\n**Are You Experienced?**\n\nLeadership is something that must be experienced in order to be delivered -\nthat's why [most online leadership\ntraining](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2019/07/04/coaching-\nmatters-how-leaders-become-better-coaches-build-stronger-teams/) programs\ndon't work. The key is to create a tailored program for your employees - one\nthat's not designed around an online curriculum, but one that focuses on the\nindividual team members.\n\nTop companies realize that [leadership\ntraining](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2019/07/25/leadership-\ntraining-without-training-wheels-whats-missing-in-executive-education/) isn't\nabout the guru at the front of the room. If you want to know if your\nleadership development program is working, don't look at the sage on the\nstage. Look at what the participants are experiencing. And measure your\nprogress.\n\nSurvey the teams that work for these leaders. Track participant's promotions\nand responsibilities. Show the organization that there is a path that works\nfor people who perform. Let current and prospective employees know that you\nhave a plan for their growth. Because leadership development is the new\npaycheck. Make sure you're ready to trade in that currency.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/westfallonline) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/westfallonline).

This is enabled by Talview\u2019s AI-\npowered video interviewing, cognitive remote proctoring, and advanced\nassessment solutions that leverage the best-in-class natural language\nprocessing, machine learning, computer vision, and video analytics\ncapabilities.\n\nTalview integrates into most applicant tracking systems (ATS) and learning\nmanagement systems (LMS) to help reviewers and administrators automate\nrepetitive tasks so they can focus on selecting the right candidates. The\nplatform itself is designed to cater for the mobile-first internet user of the\n21st century who is well-versed with virtual methods of communication.\n\n_**HR Technology News:**_[Study Reveals Flextime and Remote Working Have\nBecome the \u2018New Normal\u2019 for Global\nBusinesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/mobile-workforce/study-\nreveals-flextime-and-remote-working-have-become-the-new-normal-for-global-\nbusinesses/)\n\nSo far, Talview\u2019s talent acquisition process has helped global organizations\nsuch as Amazon, Deloitte, Swiss Re, Cognizant and Sephora become equipped to\nexcel in the growing gig economy, all while increasing its own revenue by 10\ntimes in the last two years. It has also struck partnerships with big tech\ncompanies to take its solution to customers across the globe.\n\n\u201cWe believe in solving for the customer; time to hire is the North Star hiring\nmetric for enterprises and our mission is to build the fastest hiring platform\never,\u201d said Sanjoe Tom Jose, CEO of Talview. \u201cWith this fresh round of\nfunding, we are advancing our Instahiring platform with powerful artificial\nintelligence technologies and machine learning models to make recruitment\nfaster than ever before.\u201d\n\n\"Any company's ability to execute depends on their ability to hire well and\nhire quickly.\u201d said Manu Rekhi, Managing Director of Inventus Capital\nPartners, \u201c[Talview](https://www.talview.com/) has a revolutionary tech\nsolution coupled with an amazing founding team \u2013 and their customers agree.\"\n\nTime to hire is an aspect of recruitment that many enterprises struggle with.\nTaking too long to bring new employees on board directly impacts the quality\nof the hire, as well as productivity levels and revenue generation. In fact,\n57% of job hunters drop out of the hiring funnel due to a long hiring process,\nand top candidates are only available in the market for an average of ten\ndays.\n\n\u201cAs we move more to an on-demand economy, it is critical for companies to hire\nquickly and efficiently without sacrificing quality and fit.\u201d said Arun\nPenmetsa, Partner at Storm Ventures, \u201cTalview addresses precisely this need\nand offers an AI driven Instahiring platform that is personalizing the hiring\nprocess for both candidates and enterprises.\u201d\n\nDue to developments in big data analytics, AI and ML, HR Tech is expected to\n\u201cpositively impact\u201d the growth of the HR management market, which is predicted\nto reach $30 billion in valuation by 2025.

Even as\nrecently as the past few years, companies attracted workers through perks like\nfree snacks and fun office spaces complete with ping-pong tables and nap pods.\nBut according to [Dribbble\u2019s Global Survey](https://dribbble.com/global-\ndesign-survey-2019) of 17,000 design professionals, that\u2019s all changing.\nEmployees are increasingly looking for flexibility in their jobs, and the ways\nthat they\u2019re finding those jobs and growing their skill sets are changing,\ntoo. By recognizing these trends and adapting, hiring managers can attract the\nbest and brightest talent to their organizations.\n\n## **It Pays to Offer Remote and Flexible Work**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that remote work is on the rise. With advances in technology,\nit has become simpler than ever to stay connected and take care of business,\nno matter where you are. The lifestyle benefits that remote work provides its\nemployees are easy to see\u2014better work/life balance, the ability to set one\u2019s\nown schedule, and, in many cases, a more affordable cost of living. New data\nshows that there are significant financial benefits, too. Dribbble\u2019s Global\nSurvey found that 38% of fully remote employees make more than $75,000 a year,\nbut only 23% of their on-site counterparts report making that much. While\nfully remote employees currently make up only 14% of the workforce (compared\nto 46% fully on-site), we can expect the numbers to shift significantly\ntowards remote work in the coming years as demand from employees for flexible\nwork opportunities continues to grow.\n\n## **Generic Hiring Platforms Only Get You So Far**\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but the rise of generic hiring platforms has\nactually made it _more_ difficult to get hired\u2014especially for workers in the\ndesign field, where visual portfolios demonstrate talent more effectively than\na traditional resume. As a result, designers are turning to design-specific\nhiring platforms where they can showcase their portfolios in a captivating way\nand search through jobs that are relevant to their areas of expertise. And\nalthough online job boards are still an item on the hiring checklist for many\n(18% of designers said they utilize them), many designers are making a shift\ntowards more personal interactions with hiring managers. Dribbble\u2019s Global\nSurvey found that 44% of designers pursue work opportunities through in-person\nmeans (like networking events and industry conferences), working with\nprofessional recruiters, and reaching out to companies directly.\n\n**Learn More:[How Can Procurement Create a Competitive Advantage in Talent\nAcquisition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-can-procurement-create-a-competitive-advantage-in-talent-\nacquisition/)**\n\n## **Design Education is Changing**\n\nIt may be time to reexamine how heavily formal education weighs into hiring\nwhen it comes to design, too. Dribbble\u2019s Global Survey found that while 50% of\nUS-based designers report learning their skills in school, the global design\ncommunity is largely self-taught. Globally, 42% of designers report learning\ndesign on their own\u2014just 29% report learning in school, and 15% report\nlearning their skills while on-the-job. As a company that works closely with\ndesigners and the organizations looking to hire them, we\u2019ve found that\nexamining a candidate\u2019s active, current portfolio is a better barometer of\none\u2019s skills than traditional measures like education level.\n\nRecent shifts in the talent marketplace have shown that it\u2019s time to adjust\nour hiring methods in order to attract, identify, and vet potential talent,\nespecially when it comes to design. By offering remote and flexible work\n(along with building out best-in-class processes for remote employee\nonboarding and remote [company\nculture](https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/09/26/improve-remote-\ncollaboration-5-techniques-for-ux-designers)), focusing your candidate search\non design-specific hiring platforms and in-person hiring opportunities, and\nlooking beyond traditional education when assessing someone\u2019s skills can help\nhiring managers to secure the most promising candidates for their respective\norganizations.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fthe-new-age-of-design-hiring-emerging-trends-in-talent-\nsearch%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=The+New+Age+of+Design+Hiring%3A+Emerging+Trends+in+Talent+Search\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+New+Age+of+Design+Hiring%3A+Emerging+Trends+in+Talent+Search&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fthe-new-age-of-design-hiring-emerging-trends-in-talent-\nsearch%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fthe-new-age-of-design-hiring-emerging-trends-in-talent-\nsearch%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fthe-new-age-of-design-hiring-emerging-trends-in-talent-\nsearch%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=The New Age of Design Hiring: Emerging\nTrends in Talent\nSearch&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fthe-new-age-of-design-hiring-emerging-trends-in-talent-\nsearch%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

Whether it was through Christmas bonuses, health care\nbenefits, or merely ensuring comfortable chairs at work, there have always\nbeen employers (albeit unknown and uncelebrated) who have tried to drive\nengagement at work. Having been through decades of slow evolution, it is not\nsurprising then that the basic map of employee engagement ideas that work has\nnot changed much.\n\nAre you stuck in age-old ways of engaging your employees?\n\nIs your idea of employee engagement still a boring survey followed by a\ncompulsory \"team activity\"?\n\nIt could often feel like we are drowning in the background noise of the same\nideas, just packaged differently.\n\nWhether we look at reports like Aon Hewitt's Global Trends in Employee\nEngagement, Quantum Workplace's Workplace Trends, or more recent reports like\nDeloitte's [Talent\n2020](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/about-\ndeloitte/Talent2020_Employee-Perspective.pdf) series, what stands out is that\nin the last decade, there have been certain persistent trends in employee\nengagement.\n\nFor example, over the last decade, there has been a rise in the perceived\nimportance of the employee value proposition and innovation. These facets of\n**[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/)** have now been identified as key\ndrivers of engagement. How valued and supported employees feel has emerged as\nyet another metric that determines levels of engagement, as has the quest for\nmeaningful work.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)\n\n## **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020**\n\nThe trends mentioned above, along with the growing emphasis on **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand employee experience, demand not only attention but action as well. So,\nlet's look at 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020.\n\n### **1\\. Celebrate what employees achieve in their downtime**\n\n  \nHR should be mindful of an employee's 360-degree goals and targets, even\noutside the workplace. Someone may be an accomplished artist, chef, or\nmarathon runner \u2013 and recognition in these areas is as important as typical\nworkplace recognition.\n\nAn excellent employee engagement activity for 2020 would be hosting weekly\nmeetups where every employee/team shares stories of their downtime pursuits,\nwhat they have achieved and future hopes/goals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-engage-employees-impactful-\nsolutions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n### **2\\. Upgrade communications to include video**\n\n  \nYour upgraded intranets, frequent mailers, and a cake-for-every-occasion can\nonly take you so far. They will not crack the code to the ultimate employee\nexperience. To truly provide the fabled \"holistic experience for a\nmultigenerational workforce,\" you must crack the video code.\n\nEvery employee is a consumer, and if video content works better for your\nexternal customers, it would work for your internal customers too.\n\nA video is also an excellent tool for pan-company announcements and to engage\nwith your deskless workforce, your gig workers, and your remote workers.\n\nEveryone loves a bit of the limelight, and broadcasting short culture-centric\nvideos of real employees speaking about their achievements and aspirations\nhelps to build a strong connection with the rest of your workforce. For people\nwho don't come to headquarters every day, videos can help them feel connected\nwith their teams and give them a sense of belonging and engagement.\n\n### **3\\. Give your pulse surveys a makeover**\n\n  \nWith Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, you can create pulse surveys with ease and\ncustomize them to suit your needs. But who says that a survey needs to look\nand feel like a survey? Ticking through boxes of endless options and choosing\nnumbers on a Likert scale are not the only way that your employees can tell\nyou how engaged they are.\n\nYou could ask for short WhatsApp voice notes not more than 20 seconds long \u2013\nan easy investment for your employees and for you \u2013 that encapsulates how the\nweek went. You could even do the same by asking them to upload a picture a\nweek.\n\nEmployees could also take a quick mood test, or engagement analytics tools\nthat study search trends within work systems that could give you a glimpse of\nthe general mood throughout the organization.\n\n### **4\\. Implement a non-anonymized survey to measure the engagement**\n\n  \nAnonymizing the results of an **[employee engagement\nsurvey](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** has\nalways been a best practice. And this continues to hold for more formal\nsurveys, where you measure company-wide engagement/satisfaction levels. But\nyou could also implement a non-anonymized survey for small teams and employee\ngroups.\n\nMake this a fun employee engagement activity \u2013 hand out post-its after a\nmeeting where employees can jot down their feedback with a clear signature.\nThis will help them take ownership of feedback and feel like they are being\nheard as individuals, and not as an anonymized voice in a dataset.\n\n### **5\\. Enable remote working**\n\n  \nThe modern office is not a place but a function, and in our age of instant\n(and constant!) connectivity, this function could be carried out from\nanywhere. If your company policy does not allow a work-from-home option, it\ncosts you the chance to hire and engage a massive variety of diverse talent.\n\nIt is not just millennials who demand remote working tools and flexible\nculture. While they would make up 75% of the workforce by 2020, the minority\ngenerations at work would benefit as well.\n\nCreating a culture that is anytime-anywhere (by using collaborative systems\nlike Slack, easy video-calling solutions, and ensuring regular check-ins)\nmakes your mobile workforce feel valued and trusted.\n\nThat is a sure boost to engagement because then work becomes a more enjoyable\nexercise where employees' values, goals, and vision can coexist with those of\nthe organization.\n\n### **6\\. But say goodbye to the always-on culture for a week every quarter**\n\n  \nIt isn't always possible to switch off every time we step out of the office \u2013\nbut you could make it a mandate for at least one week a quarter, where\nemployees must remain unavailable outside of work hours. Convey clearly that\nno one should expect a response to an email or an instant message during this\nweek once the employee has left for the day.\n\nActivities like these are critical to reduce burnout and ensure that employees\nare adequately refreshed to maintain optimal productivity levels. They also\nhelp employees feel cared for, just like the company's customers.\n\n### **7\\. Encourage employees to become company brand ambassadors**\n\n  \nYour employer brand needs storytellers. Cultivating a band of employee brand\nambassadors serves a two-fold purpose \u2013 fostering a strong sense of pride and\nbelongingness within employees and building a credible employer brand that\ncandidates, clients, and external points of contact can believe in.\n\nWith employees being active contributors on platforms like Snapchat,\nInstagram, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor, the art of branded storytelling can be\nmore effective and is more critical than ever before. A lot of millennials\nespecially engage while engaging others and thrive in an environment that\nallows them to express their views and opinions on social platforms.\n\n### **8\\. Invest in gamification at different levels of the employee\nlifecycle**\n\n  \nWe've all heard of how gamified candidate selection or gamified corporate\nlearning has been creating ripples. But often, considerable shifts in\ntechnology and strategy are usually a \"them\" change before they become an \"us\"\nchange.\n\nWhile new-age technology can help you elevate gamification, you could put\ngamified processes to use even without futuristic tech. Game-based learning\nnot only boosts productivity levels, but also brings in a note of fun that\nencourages a bit of friendly competition, enhances collaboration, and elevates\nthe drive to succeed.\n\nYou could assign a day for some trivia quizzed on general knowledge and the\ncompany's brand or have a monthly tournament of Chess or Settlers of Catan,\nwhere teams have to collaborate strategically. Introducing relevant games such\nas these into the company culture would only enhance the overall employee\nexperience.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Employee Experience: Are They\nReally That Different?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-employee-experience-are-they-different/)\n\n### **9\\. Offer a two-way mentorship program across departments**\n\n  \nTwo-way mentorship programs are an excellent strategy for upskilling and\nemployee engagement. They open up employees to new areas of learning and can\nserve as the key to unlocking hidden talent. It also helps employees\nunderstand their role in the larger organization.\n\nFor example, consider a two-way mentorship between a software developer and a\nmarketer. The former gets to know how their product is positioned in the\nmarket, while the latter receives a hands-on idea of the product they are\nmarketing. In the long-term, this strategy also has the potential to bolster\nyour productivity levels.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **10\\. Host frequent workshops**\n\n  \nAs adults, we tend to be averse to stepping outside our comfort zones and\nlearning new things. That is where fun workshops can shake things up.\nMoreover, this does not necessarily entail having to scour the market for\nexpensive coaches. You could source expertise internally as well.\n\nFor example, similar to the mentorship program, one of the coders could take a\ntwo-day workshop on basic HTML so that everyone in the product development\nteam knows what goes on in the backend. Workshops could also be engaging\nbrainstorming sessions or fun ideas like cocktail-making or baking that help\npeople get out of their routine while making them connect the balance of\ndifferent ingredients in a cocktail or a cake to the need for diversity at\nwork, for example.\n\n![employee engagement ideas](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020**\n\n### **11\\. Check your team's alignment to the organization's vision**\n\n  \nThe why of the organization \u2013 why it exists, why we do things the way we do\nthem, or why we wish to achieve one goal before another \u2013 is something that\nevery employee needs to understand and be on board with before they can truly\nbe engaged at work.\n\nVision alignment or being in sync with the vision of the organization is an\nessential pillar of engagement, and employees need to feel that the work that\nthey do matters and adds fuels the mission of the company.\n\nThe values and vision of the organization cannot exist merely on paper and\nwall-decals \u2013 they need to be lived every day. To do this, there should be\nenough scope for every employee to internalize what the organization stands\nfor and to align their own goals with organizational goals.\n\n### **12\\. Create an annual report of employee achievements**\n\n  \nAt the end of every year, companies publish a formalized annual report that\nshares its progress, achievements, and issues with the public. You can also\ntry a similar activity to increase employee engagement in 2020.\n\nReview performance data to find areas of outstanding performance \u2013 this could\nbe hard skills leading to business results, or soft skills that positively\nimpacted the work environment. Represent this data in a visual format, using\ncharts, infographics, badges, etc. This will encourage similar results and\nhigher productivity in the new year.\n\n### 13\\. Involve the entire company when onboarding new hires\n\nThis is particularly relevant for small-to-mid-sized businesses. Even large\nenterprises and 100% remote companies can leverage digital technology to\ngarner participation from every employee when someone new joins the company.\n\nHold a monthly onboarding day where the entire workforce gathers to welcome\nnew hires. You could also initiate a Slack thread called \"Hello! Let me tell\nyou about myself,\" where current employees (from interns to C-leaders) can\ntell the new hire something interesting about themselves. This will ensure\nthat employees are primed for engagement right from day one.\n\nBesides, for remote workers, instead of sending across the link to a recorded\nonboarding session, send them shorter video messages from team leaders and\ntheir teammates to inspire them.\n\n### **14\\. Invest in wellness at work**\n\n  \nA [report by Humana](https://www.humana.com/employer/group-benefits-101/after-\nenrollment/manage-employee-benefits/the-wellness-effect-the-impact-of-\nworkplace-programs/') called \"The Wellness Effect: The Impact of Workplace\nPrograms\" found that employee engagement and wellness are closely related. 67%\nof employees in organizations that prioritize wellness said that they felt\nmore engaged with the values and vision of the organization.\n\nWellness at work does not have to be a compulsory yoga class. Wellness\nincorporates within its umbrella physical, social, emotional, and financial\nwellness. Your wellness plan needs to be able to cater to all these aspects\nthat cumulatively ensure the holistic health of an employee.\n\nThere is also a need to destigmatize mental health challenges that many\nemployees could be facing but feel uncomfortable to ask about. Building\nsystems in place for decreasing workplace stress is more than an absolute\nnecessity.\n\nThis is an opportunity to help your employees understand that you care for\ntheir well-being, not merely to gain more productivity, but because that is\nwhat the organization believes in. Better performance is often just the\nbyproduct of a healthy workplace.\n\n### **15\\. Revamp rewards and recognition**\n\n  \nUsing AI to revamp rewards and recognition (R&R;) programs based on employee\nfeedback is a good way to get them more engaged. Employee engagement award\nideas that focus on rewarding behaviors that the organization values create a\nsense of achievement for being in tune with the culture at work. The process\nfor nomination or voting for this should be fair and objective. This helps\nfurther the cause of engagement.\n\nGiving out fun awards like the messiest-desk-but-gets-the-job-done, marbles\nunder their feet award, or an award for always thinking outside the box are a\ngreat way to get people to enjoy the process while also feeling valued and\nappreciated for what they do.\n\n### **16\\. Make diversity and inclusion the norm**\n\n  \nDiversity and inclusion is yet another facet of work that needs to become more\nthan just a mandate. It would be a fresh change for your employees to see the\norganization becoming more diverse. An environment that is an amalgamation of\ncultural, gender, and [generational\ndiversity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/the-need-for-\ngenerational-diversity-in-workplace/) is perceived to be alive and\ninteresting, and employees of all stripes thrive there.\n\nMoreover, a culture that is sensitive to the needs thought patterns, and\nideologies of individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, and\ngenerations are automatically more engaging.\n\nTo truly promote inclusivity, your organizational culture needs to allow every\nvoice to be heard. This involves allowing expression to individuals from\nminority groups and those more prone to being discriminated against.\n\nWhile taking the human out of certain screening processes could do away with\nbias, installing feedback loop portals at work that address diversity issues\nlike 15Five, OfficeVibe and CultureAmp help in setting a mechanism in place\nfor employees to express their voice at work. Besides ensuring a better mix of\nideas and perspectives, inclusivity at work also makes employees feel valued\nas individuals and not just a member of a specific group.\n\n### **17\\. Encourage work-life balance**\n\n  \nWe live in a world where attaining a [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/four-\nways-ai-is-improving-worklife-balance/) is still considered a victory, whereas\nit should be the norm. A regular working day should be one in which you get as\nmuch time for yourself and your family as you do for work. The idea is to\ncreate a schedule in which you do not feel like you are at a constant tug of\nwar between your duties at work and all that you want to accomplish outside of\nwork\n\nMaking employees always put in extra time and effort at work will lead to not\nonly burnout but also a noticeable dip in engagement. This is truer now when\nwe can always be connected to work, and where it could often be a challenge to\nswitch off our internal work mode.\n\nA transparent, open, and enabling culture would allow employees to share their\nvoice out in case they do feel that managing work and life is becoming\ndifficult. Interventions should then be arranged to find out where the problem\nlies and to make employees feel that they are not alone in their struggle.\n\n[Voice-of-the-employee\ntechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-voice-of-the-employee-technology/), individualized [employee assistance\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-administration/how-\nemployee-assistance-programs-improve-workplace-mental-health/) (EAPs), and\nguided group counseling sessions are some resources that could be put in place\nto create a culture that is inherently enabling and supportive.\n\n### **18\\. Plan creative CSR programs**\n\n  \nA [2019\nstudy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283129700_Impact_of_corporate_social_responsibility_on_employee_engagement_A_case_of_Eskom_in_South_Africa/link/5a1f68e5aca272cbfbc2f166/download)\nfinds that employee engagement and corporate social responsibility (CSR) work\ntogether to achieve organizational goals. It also found that business success\nwas partly driven by employee engagement arising from CSR.\n\nA [study by Kenexa Research Institute](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2008/09/11/1225374/0/en/The-Kenexa-Research-Institute-Reveals-Exactly-\nHow-Engaged-Employees-Are-and-What-Exactly-Employee-Engagement-Means.html)\nfurther asserts that how employees rate their pride in the organization, their\nlevel of satisfaction at work, and their willingness to recommend their\norganization to others is impacted by how they feel about the kind of work\nthat the organization does to give back to society.\n\nA genuine focus on CSR and [sustainability at\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/4-tips-to-create-a-\nculture-of-sustainability-in-the-workplace/) and can help build a personal\nconnection between the organization, the employee and the society while also\nharboring a sense of gratification in being able to add value to society at\nlarge.\n\n### **19\\. Upgrade your EVP**\n\n  \nEmployee value proposition (EVP) and **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** are closely related and both fall on the employee\nsatisfaction/happiness spectrum. EVP plays a part in how the employee\nperceives the employer brand right from the first telephonic interview until\ntheir last day and their direct impact on the employees' level of engagement\nand involvement at work.\n\nNow is the time to upgrade your EVP \u2013 the promise that you make to your\nemployees. In a market as riddled with dynamism and as wrecked with the\ncompetition, it is always helpful to take a step back and analyze what sets\nyou apart.\n\nWhat is the USP of the employee experience that you are promising? How can you\ndeliver better on this promise and make your employees want to be engaged?\n\nAnswering these questions will help you move towards engagement practices that\nare more organic and less transactional.\n\n### **20\\. Empower line managers to own employee engagement**\n\n  \nIt is time to delegate the onus of employee engagement to individuals beyond\nHR. [A white paper by Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/whos-\nresponsible-for-employee-engagement/') shows that companies like Rackspace,\nAT&T;, Progressive Insurance, Intuit, and Cintas reported better engagement\nnumbers when line managers took charge of leading employee engagement instead\nof HR managers.\n\nThis is an important finding suggesting that business leads can empower\nsupervisors and hold them accountable for the engagement of their teams while\ncreating a steady feedback loop.\n\nThe onus of employee engagement should be divided between the HR, line\nmanagers, the individual employee, and senior leaders. Top-down commitment\nacross all departments is necessary to encourage employees' commitment.\n\nMoreover, employees would automatically feel more engaged if they were made a\npart of the decisions regarding employee engagement and felt that their\nopinions mattered.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-\nquestions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n## **From Theory to Practice**\n\nA [study by Gallup ](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-\nengagement-drives-growth.aspx)found that teams that are deeply engaged are 21%\nmore productive. That's not all \u2013 Other research finds that investing just 10%\nmore in employee engagement can boost profits by $2,400 per employee annually.\n\nHow do you know whether your employee engagement ideas and activities are\nworking? Here are a few KPIs and questions that would help:\n\n**1\\. Engagement beyond work:** How many employees work outside regular\nworking hours (e.g., evenings and weekends)? Is this a good indicator of their\nown initiative, or were they asked to put in extra hours?\n\n**2\\. Broader corporate-social networks:** How many network connections does\nthe average employee have? How much time is spent with people outside of the\nimmediate team or region? This is a good indicator since passively disengaged\nemployees tend to have smaller social networks.\n\n**3\\. Participation without obligations:** What is the percentage of\nparticipation in ad-hoc meetings and initiatives that are unplanned and\nunstructured as opposed to recurring meetings and group events? For example,\ndo more employees attend team meetings where they feel attendance is mandatory\nas opposed to casual team lunches?\n\n**4\\. Branded communications:** Is any time spent in collaborating directly\nwith customers or outsiders beyond the normal scope of work? How are these\ninteractions? Is the company brand upheld with pride?\n\nThe KPIs and questions above are ones that you should keep an eye on.\n\nEmployee engagement activities must blend into a broader strategy and your\ncompany's culture to be truly effective. Without this, you are left with what\nJoelle Kaufman (CMO at Dynamic Signal) calls \"fireworks and smoke.\"\n\n\"One common mistake is what I call 'the fireworks and the smoke.' When it gets\nstarted, there's a lot of excitement, swag, a party. But a few weeks later,\nthe fireworks are over and there's just smoke. This is not a program or a\ncampaign. It's a fundamental way of operating. If you want to engage\nemployees, you have to be consistently putting out content that solicits\nengagement. It can't be just fireworks and smoke,\" she\n[said](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-engagement/building-\na-culture-of-organizational-engagement-in-conversation-with-joelle-kaufman-\ncmo-at-dynamic-signal/).\n\nEmployee engagement initiatives should go beyond protecting the bottom line \u2013\nthey should be a way of life at work.\n[Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-\ngrowth.aspx) reported 37% less absenteeism, 90% less turnover, and 28% less\nsafety incidents in organizations with higher employee engagement scores.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck for new ways to improve engagement levels in your\norganization, give these ideas a shot. Remember to measure their effectiveness\nand keep modifying the concept to suit your employees' needs.\n\n**_Do you have any innovative employee engagement ideas?

It enables HR and employees to share the most meaningful,\ntimely, relevant content with coworkers in a way that today's modern workforce\nexpects. Community makes it easy for employees to collaborate on projects,\ninterests, and initiatives, enabling higher levels of productivity. It also\nallows leaders to gain valuable insights on employee engagement, attitudes,\nand needs, actively shaping and building company culture.\n\nPaylocity's LMS makes learning and development available and easily accessible\nfor everyone. The LMS democratizes workplace education, which is another need\nthe modern workforce has expressed, by making learning flexible and intuitive.\nThis in-platform module allows companies to easily select, create and share\nlearning content for employees in the same tool they use to meet their other\nHR and payroll needs. Within Paylocity's LMS, subject matter experts can\ndesign, record and share custom courses with their colleagues \u2013 facilitating\npeer-to-peer learning. This easy-to-administer solution automatically\nintegrates with employee records within the\n[Paylocity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/benefits-\nadministration/selerix-systems-announces-api-integration-with-paylocity/)\nsystem and offers an engaging, intuitive user experience that includes access\nto extensive training and compliance course library.\n\nThe new On-Demand Payment product feature offers employees financial\nflexibility by providing them access to their earned wages during the active\npay cycle, which can reduce financial stress and help employers improve\nrecruiting and retention \u2013 without any change to payroll processes. With\nemployees expecting the same on-demand access at work that they are accustomed\nto in their personal lives, they can quickly view and request their earned\nwages within the Paylocity mobile application.\n\n**HR News:[Paychex to Introduce Five New Products at HR Tech Conference &\nExpo](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-management-hcm/paychex-\nto-introduce-five-new-products-at-hr-tech-conference-expo/)**\n\nIn addition to providing live demos of the new product features at its booth,\nPaylocity's Chief Human Resources Officer, Cheryl Johnson, will also be\npresenting at the event.

There has\nbeen an explosion in vendors using the NGLE/LXP labels to appeal to modern\nbuyers scarred by bad historic LMS experiences. What they are is a mix of\ndisruptive ideas and new ways of delivering learning. What they are not is a\nsingle buying category, so the moment to re-classify has come.\n\n\u2018What we have seen in the last three years is a convergence in solutions where\ntraditional LMSs have upped their game in terms of next gen features for\nlearner experience, collaboration and gamification\u2019 explained David Wilson,\nCEO of Fosway.\n\n\u2018Meanwhile the next gen learning platforms have been forced to back-fill\ntraditional functionality around face-to-face training and compliance by\ncustomer demand. This meeting in the middle leaves everyone confused about\nwhat the terms mean and what they really need to support learning in their\norganisation.\u2019\n\nSo, as of 2020, Fosway is changing our classification for the 9-Grid\u2122 for\nLearning Systems to segment into suites and specialists.\n\n**Learning System Suites**  are platforms supporting and integrating a broad\nrange of traditional and next gen learning approaches. They aim to cover all\nthe main bases \u2013 traditional learning management, heightened learner\nexperience, old and new learning channels.\n\nThey are the evolution of LMSs that have added next gen and learner experience\ncapabilities, but also the evolution of the NGLEs/LXPs that have back-filled\nlearning management capability to become a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 for managing modern\nlearning.\n\n**Learning System Specialists**  are the opposite. They unashamedly focus on\none area of capability with a disruptive high impact agenda. Whether that is\nbeing the best at mobile learning, doing AI-managed adaptive delivery, or\nbuilding integrated learner experiences from multiple sources, specialists\nhave a focused proposition and want to lead the market in their chosen focus\narea.\n\nSpecialists will rarely be the only Learning System in an organisation. They\ncannot cover all the areas of learning that a company needs to manage or\nsupport. Instead their goal is to disrupt the suites and to deliver heightened\nimpact in a specific area of modern learning.\n\n \u2018It\u2019s been clear to us for some time that we needed to offer buyers greater\nclarity around learning systems\u2019 said David Wilson. \u2018Our goal is to help\nbuyers cut through some of the market hype and figure out what is a real\npriority for them, what is missing from their learning ecosystem, and which\nsuppliers might be best placed to help them.\u2019\n\nThe 2020 Fosway 9-Grid\u2122 for Digital Learning is also released today and\nreflects an ever-diversifying market filled with more choice of solution than\never before. From AI and personalisation to the continued dominance of video\nand the rise of learning in the workflow, the trends report reflects a dynamic\nbut increasingly complex level of choice for L&D.\n\n_Both reports can be downloaded online  [\n_https://www.fosway.com/research/2020-fosway-9grids-\nlearning/_](https://www.fosway.com/research/2020-fosway-9grids-learning/) and\nfind out more from the Fosway analysts in person at the Fosway Analyst Lounge\n(Stand P40) at Learning Technologies London on 12th and 13th February 2020\n_<https://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/>__\n\n### Share this page\n\n[![Printer-friendly\nversion](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/all/modules/print/icons/print_icon.png)Printer-\nfriendly version](https://www.trainingjournal.com/print/6989 \"Display a\nprinter-friendly version of this page.\")\n\n## Search form\n\nSearch Form\n\n __Search\n\nSearch\n\n### [Register for our\nnewsletter](http://www.trainingjournal.com/user/register)\n\nE-mail or username *\n\nPassword *\n\nRemember me\n\n  * [Create new account](/user/register \"Create a new user account.\")\n  * [Request new password](/user/password \"Request new password via e-mail.\")\n\nLog in\n\n### Need some help with your account?\n\n[![Help!](/sites/www.trainingjournal.com/files/images/xhelp.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oP6MijqOGD.jpg)](mailto:customer.service@dodsgroup.com?subject=Training%20Journal%20account%20support%20request&body=Hi%20TJ%2C%0A%0AI'm%20having%20problems%20logging%20in%20to%20my%20account....Help!)Problems\nlogging in?

software solutions, announces its commitment to helping\nemployers attract and retain the growing segment of Generation Z employees in\nthe workforce as 2020 kicks off.\n\nGen Z \u2013 defined by Pew Research as anyone born after 1997 \u2013 is often described\nas the largest and most ethnically diverse generation in American history.\nThis generation grew up in the era of technology, the internet and social\nmedia, which means their workplace experiences and expectations are vastly\ndifferent than their Millennial counterparts. By the end of this year, it's\nprojected that Gen Z will make up 24% of the global workforce. Paylocity's\ncurrent platform analytics indicate that Gen Z makes up 11% of its clients'\nworkforces today, and with this number expected to climb in the coming months,\nPaylocity will continue to monitor these insights to ensure its clients cater\nto this generation's new set of behaviors, expectations, and preferences in\nthe workplace.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a8253f6c.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n\"Over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in optimizing our\nproduct suite to appeal to the modern worker,\" said Ted Gaty, Senior Vice\nPresident of Product and Technology at Paylocity. \"At\n[Paylocity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-management-\nhcm/paylocity-to-debut-new-solutions-that-cater-to-the-needs-of-modern-\nworkforce-at-2019-hr-tech-conference/), we understand that Gen Z will demand\ngreater personalization in how they move along their career journeys and\ninteract with workplace technology. To this end, we're helping our clients\ndesign automated experiences for payroll, learning and development,\nperformance management and employee engagement that appeal to this\ngeneration.\"\n\nPaylocity recently rolled out the following product features to support this\ngrowing segment of the workforce:\n\n  * **On-Demand Payment:** On-Demand Payment offers employees financial flexibility by providing them access to their earned wages during the active pay cycle, which can reduce financial stress and help employers improve recruiting and retention. After growing up in the Great Recession, this generation is looking for financial stability and security in their jobs. In addition, with many Gen Zers shouldering the burden of student debt, this feature gives employees peace of mind for making payments on-time while also helping organizations stand out to job candidates for robust compensation packages. Along with the entire Paylocity platform, On-Demand Payment offers a seamless user experience and gives employees the opportunity to request access to wages within minutes via their mobile devices. Across generations, On-Demand Payment is already resonating with employees.  \n\n  * **Community:** A social collaboration platform designed to increase employee connection, engagement, and productivity, Community meets Gen Z's expectations for 24/7 access to the organization. The community enables HR and employees to share the most meaningful, timely and relevant content with coworkers in a way that Gen Z expects. This feature has a digital open-door policy, meaning it enables employees to collaborate in real-time while providing transparent access to the organization's larger initiatives. Gen Z wants to know that they are contributing to the business' overarching goals, and Community offers a forum for understanding how their work is tied to the bigger picture. Though a new feature, Paylocity is seeing high utilization and employee engagement in Community \u2013 clients are taking the initiative to communicate with their workforces weekly through Community announcements around company events, benefit updates, and recognition.   \n\n  * **Learning Management (LMS) System:** Gen Z is very aware that workforce needs are rapidly changing \u2013 62% believe technical hard skills are changing faster than ever and 59% don't think their job will exist in the same form 20 years from now. With this in mind, it is key that employers showcase how they are invested in learning and development and providing Gen Z opportunities for career growth. Forty-three percent of Gen Z learners prefer a fully self-directed and independent approach to learning, and Paylocity's LMS offers just that. The LMS democratizes workplace education by making learning flexible and intuitive. Gen Z grew up learning how to do basic tasks via YouTube, and [Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com) LMS mirrors this experience by providing employee experts the opportunity to design, record and share custom courses with their colleagues.\n\n  \n**HR News:[Hiretual Launches Healthcare and Tech AI Sourcing\nSolutions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-\nonboarding/hiretual-launches-healthcare-and-tech-ai-sourcing-solutions/)**\n\nPaylocity's platform also boasts additional, existing features that appeal to\nGen Z employees in the workplace:\n\n  * **Performance Reviews & Journaling:** Gen Z isn't afraid to make mistakes, especially when it's presented as a learning opportunity. In fact, 97% of Gen Z prefers to receive feedback on an ongoing basis or directly after completing a large assignment or task. Journals provide this option for Gen Z by establishing two-way, instant communication and real-time feedback \u2013 rather than making them wait for a yearly or quarterly review. Journals also give Gen Z employees the ability to share their ideas and feel heard, allowing for a better-connected organization where unique workstyles are celebrated.  \n\n  * Impressions: Traditional top-down recognition by managers isn't the only way employees want to be noticed in today's workplace. Impressions allow employees across the organization to empower one another with real-time recognition \u2013 whether they completed a small task, a major accomplishment or are carrying out their company's values. Positive feedback from peers makes a difference and Gen Z agrees, as 79% believe that an increase in recognition rewards makes them more loyal to their employer. Paylocity's Impressions creates meaningful relationships across coworkers and contributes to a more motivated organization.\n\n  \n**HR News:[Modern Health Closes $31M in Series

teachers](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/dreamstime_xxl_71524615-696x464.jpg)](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/dreamstime_xxl_71524615.jpg)\u00a9 Monkey Business Images |\n\n## Graham Glass, CEO of CYPHER LEARNING explores how secondary school teachers\ncan harness edtech resources to maximise their limited time and supplies,\nwhile delivering a more engaging, personalised experience for students\n\nThe number of secondary school teachers has fallen dramatically in the last\ndecade or so. Teachers everywhere point to high levels of stress, long working\nhours and not enough support as the main issues behind their decision to part\nways with the [education system](https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-\nresearch/the-teacher-labour-market/), with secondary school teachers leading\nthe trend.\n\nWith smaller numbers of teachers, it\u2019s easy for secondary schools to fall in\nthe vicious cycle of poor performance: fewer teachers means bigger classes,\nwhich means each student gets less teaching attention, which leads to worse\ngrades, which reflect poorly on the teacher\u2019s professional performance, which\nmakes them want to get out of the system.\n\nTo break out of this cycle \u2014 or avoid it altogether \u2014 secondary school\nteachers do need all the support they can get. This can come in various shapes\nand forms, but [education\ntechnology](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791931/DfE-\nEducation_Technology_Strategy.pdf) will always be in the mix.\n\nSo let\u2019s explore [how teachers can harness\nedtech](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/school-leaders-edtech/77226/)\nresources to maximise their limited time and supplies, while also delivering a\nmore engaging, personalised experience for secondary learners.\n\n### How an LMS can help time-poor teachers to engage older students\n\nPart of the challenge for secondary school educators is being able to motivate\nand meet the individual needs of learners at a time when abilities, interests\nand willingness to learn can vary considerably.\n\nThe use of edtech tools such as learning management systems (LMS) can help\nteachers to improve the design and delivery of instruction, as well as support\nin assessing student progress, to give a few hours back to the teachers each\nweek while providing a more personalised learning experience for each student.\n\n### Better organisation of resources\n\nA learning management system allows teachers to host various types of learning\nmaterials in one centralised location, helping them to [streamline their\nworkloads](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/teacher-workload-\nedtech/74698/) and better plan ahead for future lessons. From the all too\nfamiliar textbooks to video recordings of lectures, audio files, YouTube\nvideos and everything in between, teachers can store and organise all types of\nlearning materials, give access to students and track their behaviour within\nthe system. No lost documents anymore!\n\n### Self-paced learning\n\nA cloud-based LMS allows students to go through learning materials at their\nown pace **.** Because of their different abilities and interests, students\nachieve mastery of concepts at different times. An LMS that supports self-\npaced learning offers students some degree of agency over their own learning\nprocess, thus meeting the needs of both high achievers and those who simply\nneed more time to understand a lesson.\n\n### Game-based learning\n\nTeachers can also use such resources to increase engagement rates with\ngamification. Gathering points, collecting badges and getting trophies are no\nlonger associated just with games. A little competition can go a long way\nduring the learning process and many school LMSs include gamification elements\nthat make it easy to design engaging online lessons.\n\n### Collaboration and communication\n\nFace-to-face communication is not the only way to get a point across a\nclassroom, and an LMS offers various ways of class collaboration. Students can\nuse an LMS to ask questions when they don\u2019t understand something, as well as\noffer answers and explain what they know, both among themselves and with the\nteacher, all when it\u2019s most convenient for each user.\n\n### Improved student assessment\n\nStudent assessment is a core element of the teaching process to ensure that\npupils are fulfilling their potential and getting the support they need in\nareas where they are struggling, however, teachers often lack the time and\ntools to make such insights. An LMS encompasses different types of assessment\nto make the process more efficient. It can have even a dozen different types\nof built-in assessments, for either summative, interim or formative\nassessments, thus allowing teachers to mix and match the best type for any\nsituation. Add to this a centralised gradebook, and the teacher\u2019s\nadministrative workload diminishes considerably.\n\n### Analytics and reporting\n\nTeachers can further sort student learning data into comprehensible reports.\nData is powerful. Teachers can create standard or custom charts and reports of\ndata such as assignment grades, lesson progress, missing work, class\ncompletion, and so on. Therefore they can pinpoint exactly where one student\nmight need extra help or when others could benefit from advanced resources.\n\n### Adaptive learning\n\nImportantly, a great learning management system should come with a set of\nfeatures that supports adaptive learning so that educators can tailor their\nteaching as the student learns. This means that as each student progresses\nthrough their learning trajectory, the system makes personalised\nrecommendations of what that student needs to do next: redo the learning\nmodule, check further resources take, enrol in a different learning path, etc.\n****\n\nThere are many ways in which education technology can ease the workload of\nsecondary school teachers, while creating a better learning experience for\nstudents. A learning management system may not be the only example, but it\nsure is one of the most comprehensible solutions educators can turn to. A good\nLMS combined with targeted professional development and other types of school\nand community support may contribute to a better retention of secondary school\nteachers.\n\n  * [ __Facebook

This function has been reinvented\nmultiple times over the last 30\u201340 years, primarily in tandem with advances in\ntechnology. Today, the function is being reimagined, thanks once again to\ntechnological advances and the changes in socio-cultural norms such advances\nhave brought about.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe rise of millennials and Gen Z in the workforce means that for the first\ntime we will have a digital native workforce. Well educated and tech-savvy,\nthis workforce demands a whole new experience from their workplace. Digital\nnatives who grew up with Facebook, YouTube, and the iPhone expect their\nworkplace experience to mirror their consumer experiences. This has an impact\non learning methodologies and technologies used in an organizational context.\n\nThe other micro trend that impacts learning functions is the rise of\nautomation in workplaces. Automation, artificial intelligence, and machine\nlearning are transforming job roles and skills faster than ever. According to\na [Brookings Institution study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-\nand-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/), nearly 25\npercent of jobs in the U.S. may be automated in the near future. Organizations\nnow are looking at ways to help train and re-train their staff for just such a\ndigital future of work.\n\nThese two external forces are acting alongside an internal force within\nlearning and development functions. Traditionally, these functions operated as\ncommand and control centers, deciding on what employees would learn, as well\nas how and when. Today the department is being asked to get out of the way of\nlearning and development and make the process more inclusive and democratic.\nWith the advent of technology, employees can find what they want and can\nchoose to learn how and when they learn.\n\nThe learning solutions marketplace has started to react to these realities and\nhence what we see today is a cacophony of solutions addressing multiple needs.\nThe learning technology buyer is bombarded with multiple solutions and\napproaches. What you may have to do is actually simple. If you are clear about\nyour organizational needs and aspirations and align them with your cultural\nand demographic realities, you may start to find the answers.\n\nIn this crowded marketplace, you may not find the one solution that solves all\nyour needs, but you can build a bouquet of solutions customized to your needs\nsourced from the market. Integrations and interactions between these multiple\nlearning systems to create a seamless user experience is thus your key\nchallenge. The cost of doing this is, of course, a primary focus and sometimes\na constraint in designing what you desire.\n\nIn the midst of this disruption, we must not forget that there are five\nlearning styles that have been identified in this guide. And we still need to\nensure that our approaches meet the diverse needs of a multi-generational\nworkforce that is trying to adapt to the ever-evolving world of technology and\nwork. Therefore, the learning technologies you choose must strike a fine\nbalance between catering to your current needs and your future needs. Like\nmost other technological decisions, this is not a destination but a journey.\nWe hope this attempt at providing some direction to these efforts helps in\nyour journey.\n\n## **Why You Need an eLearning Solution**\n\nIn today\u2019s hyper-competitive economic environment, every business function is\nunder scrutiny for the value it adds to the bottom line. And corporate\nlearning is no exception. However, the challenge with traditional learning and\ndevelopment (L&D;) initiatives has been measuring their ROI in hard dollar\nterms, especially in ways that make sense to the C-suite.\n\nBut eLearning is changing that. Thanks to the rapid pace of digital\ntransformation, a widening skills gap, and the need for businesses to\nconstantly innovate, the L&D; industry in 2019 is at a [tipping\npoint.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-is-the-year-of-learning-and-development-insights-from-\nlinkedins-2019-workplace-learning-report/) The ubiquity of digital learning\nsolutions means that L&D; leaders can now track the efficacy of their learning\nprograms and measure their business impact.\n\nThe evolution of eLearning from [learning management systems\n(LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/), which are essentially vast repositories of\nlearning content hosted on-premises or on the cloud, to the more advanced\nlearning experience platforms (LXP) that focus on enhancing the learning\nexperience and the content within it, points to the changing needs of learners\nand organizations alike.\n\nBuilding on the foundations of the traditional LMS, LXPs curate learning\ncontent, develop learning/career pathways and provide learners with\npersonalized learning recommendations. Industry analyst, Josh Bersin,\ndescribes LXPs as \u201cNetflix -like\u201d platforms with multi-device content delivery\ncapabilities, AI-driven recommendations, social profiles, and an intuitive\ninterface that mirror popular video streaming apps.\n\nAs organizations embrace the promise of data-driven decision making and\ntechnologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet\nof things (IoT), preparing employees for the future of work has become a top\npriority. Business leaders have responded by [increasing L&D;\nbudgets](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report) to\nup- and re-skill the workforce at scale.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n**So, what does this mean for you as an L &D; professional? **\n\nBigger budgets and executive buy-in means L&D; professionals will play a far\nmore strategic role in the business. As the C-suite looks to L&D;\nprofessionals to help close the skills gap and improve learning outcomes, how\ndo you build the business and investment cases to show leadership a clear path\ntowards the changes that need to occur?\n\n## **The Business Case for Corporate eLearning**\n\nIf you\u2019ve determined that your organization needs a new eLearning solution or\ntechnology, here are three ways to show the C-suite that an investment in\neLearning will yield real benefits now and in the future.\n\n  1. **Closing Your Own Skills Gap to Thrive in the Future of Work**  \nWith low unemployment levels and large-scale digital disruption, employers are\nhaving a hard time finding candidates with the skills they require, even for\nentry-level jobs. \u201cThe current climate for hiring experienced candidates is\ntough, especially as we approach a more \u2018fluid\u2019 workforce. With a low\nunemployment rate, fewer people are seeking jobs because they actually need\nthem than at any time I can remember,\u201d says Jerry Cox, CEO at\n[Brainer](https://www.brainier.com/). \u201cOne study we read recently says that\nnearly 65 percent of children entering primary school today will ultimately\nend up in a job type that doesn\u2019t exist yet. I\u2019m actually surprised it\u2019s not\nhigher than that. For example, consider the fact that the learning tools we\ncurrently use online did not exist when we were starting in school. They\nweren\u2019t even thought of.\u201d According to the Harvard Business Review, only [15\npercent](https://hbr.org/2017/11/managers-arent-doing-enough-to-train-\nemployees-for-the-future) of employees report that their employers offer them\nopportunities to develop the technical skills they will need in the future.\nAnd just 8 percent say they are given the chance to expand their management\nand leadership skills.  \n  \nWith technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep\nlearning becoming essential to conducting business, regardless of the\nindustry, employers need to prepare their workforce for the future of work.\nAnd eLearning solutions help HR and L&D; professionals achieve upskilling and\nreskilling at scale.  \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about scalability,\u201d says Piers Lea, Chief Strategy Officer at\nlearning technology solutions major, [LTG](https://www.ltgplc.com/). \u201cTo quote\nJohn Hagel, founder of the Deloitte Centre for the Edge, \u2018Scalable learning is\nthe new reason for large organizations to exist.\u2019 The old concept of the\ntraining course must be replaced by channel thinking. Organizations must\nestablish channels to reach people with necessary learning right in the flow\nof work. And not just one channel, but many. Smart learning solutions are\nmultichannel, multimodal learning solutions.  \n  \nSo, for example, in addition to one-way eLearning courses, solutions must\noffer tools for collaboration and for employees to exchange knowledge and\nexperience through rich media like video.\u201d  \n  \nJerry Cox believes that the hallmark for successful organizations is\ncontinuous learning and skill development. He says, \u201cWhile a formal education\nis a good foundation, we must be prepared to teach high quality, high aptitude\nnew hires new skills and provide the knowledge they currently don\u2019t have.\nContinual skill development and refinement has been a hallmark for many\nsuccessful organizations to create a competitive edge.  \n  \n\u201cTo take it a step further, successful organizations will look to include on-\ngoing learning as an actual benefit. While it has historically been difficult\nto show straight-line ROI results from investing in L&D;, the residual effect\nof this investment is often an increased sense of loyalty to the organization.\nEmployees feel valued when their employer shows them that they have a future\nwithin the organization and are going to give them the tools they need to be\nsuccessful in the long term.\u201d\n\n  2. **Deliver a Differentiated Employee Experience to Increase Retention**  \nEmployees want to work for organizations that offer new opportunities to learn\nand grow. In fact, one of the top reasons people change jobs today is for\n\u2018career growth opportunities.\u2019 As employees perceive workplace experience\nthrough the lens of culture, L&D; opportunities, and effective leadership \u2013\nproviding them with a flexible, mobile, learning platform is not just an\neffective attraction and retention tactic, but also a forward-looking business\nstrategy.  \n  \nWith the increasing application of AI and ML across eLearning solutions,\nemployers can personalize learning content delivery to improve engagement and\nexperience. Here are five applications of eLearning technologies that can help\nyou improve the employee experience:\n\n    * **Mobile-learning:** Mobile-learning, also known as mlearning, is an L&D; concept that makes learning accessible across portable devices like smartphones and tablets. While mobile delivery is at the heart of effective mlearning, it is not solely the delivery model that makes it different from traditional learning approaches. The learning content also varies significantly for mlearning courses. The idea is to meet learners where they are and deliver an engaging learning experience to improve learning outcomes. Jodi Younes, L&D; Director at [Goodway Group](http://goodwaygroup.com/), says, \u201cMeet your learners where they are. Learners are already connected through mobile phones, tablets, and computers.   \n  \nOrganizations must create easy to consume, impactful, engaging opportunities\nthat make learning fun. As we move towards a gig-economy, this will be a\ncritical element to L&D; strategy.\u201d  \n\n    * **On-demand learning:** At a time in which we\u2019ve become so accustomed to having information at our fingertips, employee expectations from workplace learning also flows along similar lines. They want to be in control of their own learning, challenging the traditional approach to L&D; that was slow to respond to learner needs. \u201cCreate on-demand learning opportunities that are short, high quality and high impact, as well as tailored to the needs and gaps of the learner. Ditch the old ways of dictating when learners can attend a training session and give them the flexibility to access learning when, where and how they want it! It is also important to remember to offer a variety of learning formats. Some learners prefer shorter, virtual training opportunities, whereas others prefer live, face to face sessions and others may even prefer to learn from coaching, mentoring and on the job opportunities. Provide flexibility so learners can have access to tailored learning that fits their wants and needs,\u201d advises Jodi.  \n\n    * **Microlearning:** Microlearning is a way of delivering learning content to learners in small, bite-sized bursts to improve retention. Like on-demand learning, microlearning is also largely a self-directed learning experience. Jodi recommends that L&D; teams add interactive features like gamification, chat, and videos to boost engagement with microlearning. She says, \u201cLearning leaders need to continue to focus on bite-size, short training, especially taking into account the fact that so much learning can happen on a mobile device. App-based learning, quick videos, and chat features are all ways to integrate microlearning experiences.\u201d  \n\n    * **Digital Knowledge Sharing:** \u201cSocial learning is key!\u201d says Jodi. \u201cFinding ways to integrate social learning helps reinforce learning and best practices. Again, considering the gig-economy and virtual workforce, digital knowledge sharing, and social networks help employees share information, stay connected and cross-learn. When considering Millennials and Gen Z workers, they use text messaging and social networks to communicate, even more so than email or phone. Finding learners where they already spend their time is key.\u201d  \n\n    * **Curated content via a content management system:** Information overload is one of the most common problems we face as customers today. Thanks to smart digital technologies, we just have TOO many options for everything from movies on Netflix, to shoes on Amazon. Your employees face similar challenges when deciding on a learning program. There\u2019s too much learning content available and it becomes challenging to find what is of value. Content curation as an L&D; strategy can help employees navigate the sea of learning content to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for and become motivated learners.  \n  \n\u201cProvide a space for learners to easily access and find a vast amount of\ncontent. With continued reliance on the cloud, the possibilities are endless!\nThe key to having an effective content management system is structure. L&D;,\nHR, and leadership all need to have an understanding of the skills learners\nneed to grow and help them identify opportunities to develop their\ncapabilities. Employees should own their individual development and providing\nthem a space with adequate training and resources, plus leadership and\norganization support helps to increase engagement and results,\u201d says Jodi.  \n\n  3. **Contain Costs**  \nWhile both points above are equally important to the C-suite, cost containment\nmay be the star of your eLearning business case. Traditional learning and\ndevelopment programs have been resource and cost-intensive (think seminars and\ninstructor-led programs). With eLearning, you can easily save on travel\nexpenses, accommodation, and the trainer\u2019s fee. eLearning offers a flexible\napproach to employees to work towards their self-development at their\nconvenience. Also, eLearning is typically quicker and more effective than\nclassroom training. Which means quicker inductions, lower downtimes, and\nsignificant cost savings.  \n\n## **Vendor Mapping:**\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the popular eLearning platforms and their features**:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)**_Figure 1_**\n\n## **Implementation Plan**\n\nAssuming your business case for an eLearning platform has been approved, it\nwould be helpful at this point to formulate a basic implementation plan. An\nideal implementation plan should include the change management strategy,\ntimelines, and other key elements of the initiative as listed in our\nimplementation guide (figure 2).

But these methods often get overlooked or\nwritten off as too complicated to use.\n\nWhile acronyms like API, LTI, and SSO can seem intimidating at first, once you\nunderstand how they work, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d looked under the hood of your LMS\nsooner. Using these tools can expand the functionality of your LMS and may\neven save you the work of switching to a new one.\n\nThis post explores some common ways you can tap into your LMS data or\nintegrate with third-party services.  \n\n##  **Application Programming Interface (API)**\n\nAn API is a set of protocols, or a library of functions, that allow\nprogrammatic access to the features of your LMS. APIs are particularly useful\nfor writing programs that integrate your LMS with third-party systems.\n\nAPIs can be written in different programming languages, and your LMS probably\noffers a few choices. APIs typically allow you to access data about the users,\ncourses, assessments, and scores associated with your LMS.\n\nAt its simplest, an API works like this:  \n\n  * There is an encrypted API key created within the LMS.\n  * A program is written using protocols from the LMS\u2019s API library.\n  * The API key grants the program access to the LMS data.\n  * The program uses the data to perform actions, send data to a third-party system, and more.\n  * The program is \u201ctriggered\u201d by a \u201cwebhook\u201d within the LMS or is set to run at specific intervals.\n\nYou might use an API to:\n\n  * Enroll employees into specific courses from your HRIS.\n  * Report learner progress to your HRIS.\n  * Update your company database with data from your LMS.\n  * Add specific learners from your LMS to a mobile learning app.\n\nOnce you grasp the concept of how APIs work, the other tools under your \u201cLMS\nhood\u201d won\u2019t seem nearly as intimidating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **API Tips**\n\nSome LMSs take advantage of API development services like\n[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), which can help you build and test your\nAPIs.\n\nSince LMSs typically have good documentation for their APIs, hiring someone to\ncode one shouldn\u2019t be that expensive. An LMS may have a list of partners they\nrecommend.\n\nYour API programs need to be hosted on a server so they can be \u201ccalled\u201d from\nthe LMS or other service. Make sure you have control over where that server is\nlocated (typically where you host your website).\n\n## **Direct Integrations**\n\nMost LMSs have direct integrations with popular third-party services. That\nmeans they\u2019ve eliminated the need to write your own APIs to connect to them.\n\nSome commonly integrated services include Salesforce, Office 365, Google\nDrive, OneDrive, MailChimp, Slack, Turnitin, Kaltura, Zoom, Zendesk, and\nothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your LMS supports [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), your possibilities for\ndirect integration have just grown exponentially! Zapier is an integration\ntool that serves as a bridge (yes, like an API) between your LMS and hundreds\nof other services.  \n\n##  **Learning Tool Interoperability (LTI)**\n\nLTI is an initiative managed by the [IMS Global Learning\nConsortium](https://www.imsglobal.org/) to seamlessly integrate learning\napplications used by instructors into their courses.\n\nLTIs are like out-of-the-box APIs specifically for learning tools and are much\neasier to set up than custom APIs. These tools can be courses, videos, audio,\nmaps, assessments, badges, and more. And there are a lot of cool\n[too](https://www.edu-apps.org/)[ls](https://www.edu-apps.org/)!\n\n## **Single Sign-On (SSO)**\n\nSSO is an authentication process that permits a user to enter one name and\npassword to access multiple applications. Your LMS might provide SSO options\nfrom popular services like Facebook, G Suite, or Office 365 and may also offer\ncustom integration options that you can use for your own infrastructure.\n\n## **Look Under the Hood of Your LMS**\n\nTake some time to research the tools available on your LMS. You may find\nsolutions to problems you thought you\u2019d never solve.\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Emerging Tech](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Emerging%20Tech)\n  * [Learning Management Systems](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Learning%20Management%20Systems)\n  * [Learning Technologies](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Learning%20Technologies)\n  * [Tools & Platforms](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Tools%20%26%20Platforms)\n  * [xAPI](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=xAPI)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/DeltinaHay-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Deltina Hay](https://www.td.org/user/about/DeltinaHay-000001)\n\nDeltina Hay is an author, educator, developer, and the CTO of Elearning Delta.\nFor nearly 30 years, Deltina has done custom programming, database management,\nweb development, SEO, and LMS consulting for businesses of all sizes.

From cloud-based software to building entirely new\ninfrastructure, companies are investing heavily in HR technology.\n\nThe massive disruption that machine learning and automation has caused has\nforced us to reconcile all that we thought we knew about the future of work.\nEven \u2018expert\u2019 predictions are unable to fully gauge the entire scope of this\nmassive, dynamic environment.\n\nThere\u2019s no human match to the finesse and accuracy of the technical tasks that\nmachines can undertake. Technology is the central part of any job now; be it\nIT or Human Resources. The Future of jobs and skills required for them is the\nmajor agenda in many major global conferences.\n\nOut of the many ways that technology is shaping the future of work, some of\nthe most prominent are;\n\n **The Problem of Plenty**\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that technology has shaken things up in HR, for the\nemployer and subsequently the employee.\n\nChange is always an overwhelming state of mind in the beginning. But for the\ndiscerning employee and the employer, there\u2019s a \u2018problem of plenty\u2019 when it\ncomes to the many means towards an end in a technologically advanced world. AI\nhas increased options by manifold, giving employees the tools to perform\neffectively and achieve what was previously unattainable. It has also made it\neasier for employers to present myriad options for open communication,\nlearning and development and personal growth.\n\nSince the last few years, technology has made companies move forward from\ntraditional emails to sophisticated collaborative software, high-end video\nconferencing and applications that help more efficient teamwork like Facebook\nWorkplace, Microsoft Team, Slack, HipChat, etc.\n\nThere have already been a slew of innovations in the performance management\nsystem, talent management software and recruiting. Companies are now investing\nin tools that need to be as adaptable as the changing expectations and job\nroles. Transparency in performance management is a by-product of rapid\ninnovation in this sphere. From goal setting to performance reviews, companies\nare bringing in technology at every step of the way.\n\n**Freedom of Expression & Personalization**\n\nMachine learning has enabled Human Resources to move its attention from the\norganization to the team to right down to the employee.\n\nTechnology is actually bringing HR closer to the employee. It is helping de-\ngeneralize the audience and look at each employee as a customer who values the\nexperience. From anonymous feedback tools such as the popular Glassdoor and\nthe underdogs like Fishbowl, Owler, and Whisper, there are now a variety of\nplatforms for the employee to voice an opinion, participate in polls and\nopenly discuss issues.\n\nThis has made it easier for organizations to learn about what employees feel\nand drive their employee engagement initiatives aligned with that. To enable\ncontinuous listening, companies have employed a number of tools of feedback,\nmentoring and communicating in general.\n\n**AI in Learning**\n\nThe biggest achievement of Artificial Intelligence is that it has helped us\nmake sense of the information overload that stares at our faces in the\nInternet age. Organizations are experimenting with hundreds of courses, micro-\nlearning systems, books, articles, videos, etc.\n\nTechnology has also made it possible for Subject Matter Experts to become\ntrainers and make their own content like videos and programs. It has enabled\neven mid-sized and small companies to adopt sophisticated VR and AR in their\nlearning plans.\n\nIntegrated LMS and mobile phone learning have seen a big boom and we can now\nsay that we are in a renaissance of learning. Leaders like Degreed, EdCast,\nCornerstone, etc are making pathways in innovating learning experience\nplatforms to be cutting edge and interactive. Easy, mobile-friendly, simple to\nuse and scalable, these platforms have transformed the role of Learning &\nDevelopment from a sluggish, reactive function to a dynamic, proactive\nstimulus to the organization. Learners are now enjoying a Netflix-like\nexperience in learning and this is only going to get savvier!\n\nAI is helping HR professionals sort data on learning preferences and employee\nskillsets, draw useful conclusions and make better choices. It has helped\nprovide learning content tailored to the exact competencies that are needed in\nthe employee to be agile.\n\nIn a survey conducted by Dale Carnegie, 81 percent of executives consider\nagility to be the most important characteristic of successful organizations.\nMore agile companies report a 60 percent faster time to market and 59 percent\nfaster innovation.\n\nThrough the right application of technology, HR is now playing the eminent\nrole of a strategic business partner helping organizations become agile in the\nface of volatile change. By providing the workforce the chance to upskill and\nlearn in a manner that is most suitable to the employees, technology is\nhelping the HR function evolve into a catalyst of dexterity.\n\n**A Big Wide Blue Ocean**\n\nTechnology has made the world a smaller place. But for HR, it has made it a\nbig wide blue ocean that is full of a great catch. While technology has helped\nconnect employees worldwide, it has also enabled widespread outsourcing of\nwork. With that, it has also made work management systems for the contingent\nworkforce an essential factor for the HR function. As organizations realize\nthat more and more work can be outsourced, technology like ERP/Core HR systems\nwith built-in interfaces and tools to manage the gig workers will gather\nsteam.\n\nIn fact, technology is also enabling HR to provide a uniform employee\nexperience regardless of the location. With the help of data available about\nemployees, HR professionals will be able to accurately measure performance and\nprovide the right resources to even the out-of-office workforce.\n\n**Out goes the Mundane in Recruiting**\n\nFor some companies, recruiting and talent sourcing could be as simple as\napplicant tracking, collating resumes, scoring applicants, etc. But for\nfuture-focused organizations, it actually starts with creating an employer\nbrand, reaching out to the right sources, visibility on the right platforms,\nfinding ambassadors in a strong alumni network and so on.\n\nTechnology has made it easier for HR to undertake candidate marketing, job\nadvertising, identifying passive candidates, administering assessments, etc.\n\nSince recruitment is one of the most important things that an HR function\ndoes, recruitment software is one of the most dynamic and exciting spaces in\nthe HR technology space. Many ERP and platform providers have integrated\nrecruitment systems and are now integrating multiple business units at a fast\nspeed. From crowdsourcing applications that help remove bias and gender\ndiscrimination to the video-based assessment system, even smaller vendors are\nmaking great progress in recruitment technology.\n\nThe HR function is set to play a more critical role in the organization\u2019s\nsuccess with the onset of sophisticated technology. Due to the tools now\navailable at its disposal, HR can react to the needs of the organization more\nefficiently and augment the workforce abilities at the pace that is needed in\nthe disruptive business environment.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[HR Tech](/tags/HR-Tech-86338/) [disruption](/tags/disruption-53977/)\n[jobs](/tags/jobs-1747/) [skills](/tags/skills-52187/) [future of\njobs](/tags/future-of-jobs-92025/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

Are organizations\ntruly prepared for the ten major trends that would impact the work-worker-\nworkplace triad in the ten years to come?_**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nDespite the general perception of linear progression and a rapid blitzkrieg of\nchange, there is something quite comfortably cyclical about the rise and fall\nof trends. Though the future of work may often seem murky now, it is assuring\nto know that many of the present aspects of work that we are so used to today,\nwere once mere predictions\u2026or science fiction! If the world of work\ncollectively had the power to adapt, evolve and strive ahead then, it can do\nso now too.\n\n## **What is the Future of Work?**\n\nThe future of work is a ubiquitous topic of debate and discussion and not\nwithout reason. It is always important to ask \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d\nespecially in an environment as change-centric as ours.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s Global Human Capital Trends report for 2019, as you can see below,\nprovides an interesting slice of insight into trends to watch out for over the\nten years to come.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Source:_ _Deloitte\u2019s 2019 Global Human Capital Trends Report_**\n\nThe report, based on a longitudinal survey of 10,000 participants across 119\ncountries, is based on what professionals today are assigning value to and\nwhat they feel are and would be the biggest opportunities and challenges to\nrise to in the next few years.

Definition, Process and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-full-cycle-recruitment/)**\n\n## **What is the Future of Work? 10 Key Trends for the Next 10 Years**\n\nThe future of work would be born out of the present landscape at work \u2013 an\namalgamation of the need to change, the desire for speed and the demand for\naugmented experiences. Here are the ten key trends that organizations should\nprepare for.\n\n### **1\\. Learning to Learn, Unlearn and Relearn**\n\n  \nChange presupposes adaptation. With the larger environment and its smaller\nmoving parts undergoing digital and technological tectonic shifts, is it not a\nsurprise that professionals across the globe perceive learning as the most\nimportant trend to prepare for.\n\n**Hawley Kane, Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development at\nSaba Software** says, \u201cHands down we see the connection of learning to\nperformance as being the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here\u2019s the crux of it: For\nhigh-performing organizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the\nbehavior that drives performance.\u201d Hawley adds that learning and performance\nmanagement do not merely co-exist - they are dependent on one another. To\ndeliver learning experiences that move the needle on performance, talent\nleaders need to empower employees to drive their own development with learning\nthat is aligned to the individual, the team and relatable business goals.\n\n**Heide Abelli, Senior Vice President, Content Product Management at\nSkillsoft** feels that a huge trend to watch out for in organizational\nlearning is \u201cthe growing sense of urgency to address gaps in the readiness of\nthe workforce to execute on the digital agenda. With the introduction of new\nroles, the elimination of outdated roles, the increased scope of\nresponsibility in key roles and the removal of management layers, the\nchallenge around talent readiness is enormous.\u201d\n\nLearning is inextricably connected to the workings of any organization, more\nso today than ever before and the way organizations learn is changing.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/) **\n\n### **2\\. Driving Employee Experience**\n\n  \nWe live experientially. The rising importance of the user interface has\nextended to the workplace as well. At work, however, the employee experience\nis not limited to the technological interfaces alone \u2013 every interaction that\nan employee has with the organization right from the stage of candidacy to\nwhen the employee leaves or retires.\n\n\u201cAt the crux of all business transformation, there are people, not\ntechnology,'' says **Gajendra Chandel, the ex-CHRO of Tata Motors**. To enable\nany change, at any level, organizations need to keep in mind the experience\nthey offer to their employees, the relevance the transformation can and will\nhold for their people. They also need to craft strategies that enable people\nto do meaningful work (for them and for the business). The culture at work and\nhow diversity is managed becomes all the more important and the focus shifts\nto the individual.\n\nWith technology paving the way, organizations need to adapt to the kind of\nexperience employees want. All aspects of talent management and people metrics\nwould need to have not just the business goal in mind but also the goal of\nproviding engaging employee experience.\n\n### **3\\. Talent Mobility v/s Stagnation and Complacency**\n\n  \nThe Echelon Group\u2019s definition of talent mobility as, \u201cthe practice of moving\npeople within an organization, in hopes that new skills will be gained and\nsharpened through the employees' new roles and responsibilities\u201d hits the nail\non the head. In the present race for talent, engagement is the key to holding\nonto the right employees. In order to engage employees long-term, there needs\nto be a culture that fights career stagnation and role immobility. Allowing\nworkers to move within the system, find their niche, have the allowance to\nswitch and find a new niche to reinvent their skillsets is a great way to help\nemployees grow and to retain them. This holds especially true in an ecosystem\nwith a rising alternative workforce.\n\nEmployees are now choosing a job based on the level of work flexibility it\noffers. Thus, quickly becoming an important parameter for job-decisions,\ntalent mobility will drive the quality of employee engagement as well as that\nof the workforce. \u201cThis is a trend that shows no signs of stopping. Thirty-\neight percent of hiring managers predict that their employees will work\npredominantly remotely in the next ten years,\u201d says **Zoe Harte, Senior Vice\nPresident, Human Resources and Talent Innovation, at Upwork**. Allowing\nremote-work could be an effective way to communicate to present and future\nemployees the organization\u2019s openness to incorporate the individual\u2019s\npreferences and growth needs into the job role.\n\n### **4\\. The Evolution of Leadership**\n\n  \nWith the work, worker and workplace changing, leaders and styles of leadership\nneed to evolve as well. With the decrease of age-based seniority, the growing\nimportance of building relationships in building employee engagement, the\ngenerational shift in the workplace majority. Redesigned managerial structures\nand the universal culture of agility, the kind of leaders that organizations\nneed and want has changed. This is not merely because of the millennial boom\nbut rather due to a mix of all the factors stated above.\n\nSallyann Della Casa, Founder at GLEAC, points out that workplaces \u201cneed to be\nemployee-centric, there is no longer any specific size that fits all. Many\nworkforces are now virtual, work at home is a normal day at the office, teams\nassemble and dis-assemble based on projects with no fixed roles or titles but\ninstead matching competencies for project needs.\" The leaders to come thus\nneed to be able to deal with such a workforce build effective relationships\nand create a winning strategy every day. The more human-centric leadership\nskills will be the greater priority in a world that gets progressively\ndependent on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and newer\ntechnologies.\n\n### **5\\. Faster, Better, Simpler HR Technology**\n\n  \nWith AI and ML making inroads into core and subsidiary HR functions, the\nfuture demands better integration. **Prithvi Shergill, Co-Founder, Co-create\nTomorrow** states, \u201c60 to 70 percent of organizations today say that they use\nAI to enhance valuation.\u201d He adds, \u201cbeing able to adopt technology is not\nalways about a mindset shift or reluctance but rather an issue of budget and\nauthority.\u201d\n\nWith HR tech becoming a trend that organizations need to adopt and adapt\neffectively, both the enterprise mindset and budget planning needs to be in\nfavor of the smoothest transformation. This applies to the selection of the\nright human capital management (HCM) tools and suites as well.\n\nSallyann says, \u201cHCM's today have to be predictive in nature interpreting and\nmaking connections with data, easy plug and playable and competency-centric.\nBy predictive, it should have an employee engagement bot that talks to a\nlearning and development system (because one of the stickiest measures of\nengagement is how much someone thinks they are learning) and send off warning\nsignals when either one goes haywire.\u201d A good HCM system should also allow\neasy plug and play features. That is where the future of HR tech needs to lead\norganizations \u2013 towards work that is easy, smart and engaging.\n\n**Learn more:[The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)**\n\n### **6\\. Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication**\n\n  \nThe future of work demands that organizations invest in creating a culture\nwhere creativity thrives, collaboration is facilitated and communication is\nencouraged. The current trend of leading by example requires this cultural\nshift to be driven top-down with the effective involvement of C-suite\nemployees. Collaboration not only refers to the cooperation between teams and\nfunctions but also between business leaders and HR heads.\n\n**Engelbert Camasura, President & CEO of Asia Select, Inc.** pointed to the\nimportance of the role of HR in making the AI revolution and the digital\ntransformation a dual success. He says, \u201cCHROs need to take a bolder stand and\nbe true business leaders instead of being service delivery executives or even\njust business partners.\u201d The onus of business transformation thus needs not\nonly to be partnered by but also co-led by the HR.\n\nBeing a part of the AI revolution is an active decision to make and to stick\nby. Englebert also spoke of how data needs to be regarded not as a challenge\nbut rather as an enabling tool. Businesses thus need to make a shift and focus\non the resources-mindset-data triangle to reap the benefits of the revolution\nthat is near.\n\n**Learn more:[What Is HR Digital Transformation? Definition, Strategies, and\nChallenges](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)**\n\n### **7\\. From Wellness to Happiness at Work**\n\n  \n**Dr. Rajiv Kumar, President & Chief Medical Officer of Virgin Pulse, **states\nthat the three most important reasons for organizations to embrace workforce\nwellness are:\n\n  1. Employees expect and demand that their place of employment offer this benefit. Millennials, which comprise the largest share of our workforce today, choose where they work based on a company demonstrating that it cares for them. An important way to show that care is by offering a comprehensive wellbeing program.\n  2. Bottom-up wellbeing programs are an essential tool to foster workforce collaboration and cohesion, which leads to strong, vibrant corporate cultures.\n  3. When implemented correctly, wellbeing programs can save organizations a lot of money in healthcare costs, decreased absenteeism and presenteeism, and even decreased employee attrition.\n\n  \nThe importance of mental and emotional health at work is gaining increasing\ntraction and not without reason. With AI-enabled tools to monitor and guide\nemployee health better, the trend of creating a healthier and happier\nworkforce is actively guiding organizational decisions.\n\n### **8\\. The Rise of \u201cSuperjobs\u201d**\n\n  \n**Anand Shankar, Partner, Leader \u2013 HR Transformation, Deloitte,** speaks of\n\u201csuperjobs\u201d as the natural outcome of our collaborative transformation.\nOrganizations need to start preparing for the skill-requirements of tomorrow\nand ensure that their employees are ready to rise up to the challenge.\nCreating an adept and agile talent pipeline rests on an adequately skilled\nworkforce that can collaborate with the latest technology. As AI gears up to\naugment jobs, human roles need to be augmented as well. Organizations will\nneed to relook at the implications of the transactional aspects of work being\ndone away with and even strategic decisions being aided.\n\nThus, with jobs evolving to superjobs that set the context for skill-\ndevelopment, basic processes and our understanding of them would predictably\ngo through some tweaks as well. This is a trend that is separate from the more\nwidespread updating in learning and development processes because this has to\ndo with the modification of jobs, tasks, and roles as we know them.\n\n### **9\\. A Treasure Trove of Data**\n\n  \nToday, our data universe defines who we are, and every digital experience that\ncomes our way is based on and tuned to our data identity. Even companies like\nTwitter use algorithms to make precise assumptions about our gender for\nexample simply based on our activity on the platform. All, this, just to\nexperience a world that is more personalized \u2013 more us.\n\nWhat implications do innovations such as these have on the work-worker-\nworkplace ecosystem? Employees also seek individualized interactions from\nevery aspect of work. We look for immersive experiences in what is \u201cno longer\nan Internet of Things (IoT) but rather an Internet of Me (IoM)\u201d, as **Shawn\nDuBravac, Founder & President at the Avrio Institute **puts it. \u201cThe interface\nof information is changing how we interact with technology,'' adds Shawn. As\nwe move from a digitized environment to a datafied one, organizations need to\nbe able to keep up with this abundance of data in order to avoid scarcity of\ninformation.\n\nThis is what businesses of the near-future would need to mine intelligently to\ndeep-dive into a ready, on-demand pool of information to make better\ndecisions, create happier workplaces and lead to greater business success.\n\n### **10\\. Winning with diversity**\n\n  \nWith data analytics and AI-enabled tools striving to create decision-making as\nprejudice-free as possible, a mature conversation on diversity appears to be a\nquickly evolving trend. More companies today are coming forward to recognize\nthe need for proper diversity education and not just sensitization. With that,\nthe dialogue has shifted from having a laundry list for diversity and\ninclusion (DI) initiatives to more meaningful and actionable plans that could\nactually make a difference.\n\n\u201cInequity in the workplace breeds lack of consumer loyalty while inclusive\ncultures can yield a stronger customer base,\u201d says Bill Proudman, CEO of\ndiversity consulting firm White Men As Full Diversity Partners (WMFDP).\n\nTaking a DI stance on recruitment was one of the first efforts started albeit\nto score brownie points as an employer brand. Whatever the motivation might\nhave been, it was a much-needed journey to start and one that will hopefully\nonly pick up the pace till diversity becomes an organic part and parcel of any\norganization. Jill Strange, VP of Science Applications of Infor HCM warns,\n\u201cWhile candidate assessment is not a new concept, using AI to help speed up\nthe recruiting process is still in its nascent phases. As more companies\ncontinue to bet big on AI to help them overcome unconscious biases, it is\ncrucial that HR leaders work with AI throughout the hiring process, rather\nthan relying on it to solve institutional bias,\u201d\n\nWith diversity, despite the multiple strings of conversation around the topic,\nthe process has been relatively slow since stereotyping, being prejudiced and\nexercising bias are all thought and behavior patterns that are evolutionarily\nentrenched in us. That said, the trend is surely on the rise and with\ntechnology adding more impetus to it, the coming decade could hope to see the\nmomentum picking up as newer demographic compositions start working together.\n\n**Learn more:[What is Talent Pipeline? Definition, Management with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)**\n\nWhile these are the key trends we see growing to impact the workplace in the\ncoming decade, the world of work is a dynamic macrocosm where even the\nsmallest changes, lead to big differences and subsequent trend waves.

Technology is holding\na centre stage and making its way in almost everything we do. It has become\nnearly impossible to run HR without technology and that\u2019s how we are buying\ntechnology to match the pace of change. Automation is on the rise and people\nare anxious about jobs, skills and machines, putting enormous pressure on the\nHR to manage its resources. The need is to give back people simpler, better\nand more productive work experience. Josh Bersin, in his address shared some\nkey insights around the changing nature of HR technology.\n\n### Three seismic shifts in HR\n\nWorld of HR has witnessed three seismic shifts- first, during the year 2000,\nin the form of automating all the paper forms and bringing processes in a\nsingle integrated platform. Second shift, is all about moving towards \u2018cloud\nplatform\u2019 where things got little better and faster. Though, HR got rid of\nsome legacy systems, it still didn\u2019t improve the employee experience. The\nthird shift is mostly about elevating employee experience and it asks if we\ncan buy technology that actually improves employee experience and engages\nthem? Today, people are more concerned if the systems are easier to use, or\nthe technology making them more productive and connecting them with others.\nThese requirements have resulted in the emergence of employee experience\nproducts, strongly backed by technology- be it chatbots, portals, case\nmanagement tools , talent products etc. this is like the new layering of tools\nthat are being built.\n\n### Changing Architecture\n\nThe entire architecture is changing- lot of money is being spent on developing\nHR tools and on an average, large companies are having 10-13 HR tools related\nto talent application and employee experience. Recognizing its importance,\nmany big companies like Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Microsoft, Google, IBM,\nLinkedIn have entered the HR market and coming up with better learning\nplatforms, network based models and more productive applications. These giants\nare giving tough competition to the core HR vendors, compelling them to raise\nthe bar. The data based technology is changing, the way we work and manage\npeople is changing and thus organizations will need better tools to manage the\nsame. Organizations will need to decide which HR tools and technology to buy\nand use.\n\n### Emergence of new technology and experience tools\n\nNew age companies are digital savvy, innovative, creative and practise\ncontinuous learning. This has created a market for different tools for them\nlike, people analytics tools that can do organization-level network analysis,\nwell being tool that can give you direct coaching and feedback, social\nrecognition tools, goal sharing and KRs tools, agile ongoing learning tools..\nThese are much more than mere applications and should be seen as an important\nway to understand more about the employee experience. By using principles of\ndesign thinking and segmenting workforce to determine what are the important\nexperiences that matter to them in their role. Let\u2019s have a look at some tools\nand technologies which are being used to enhance employee experience.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nAI is everywhere! Vendors are building interesting applications - it is now\npossible for employees to assess themselves on coaching skills and get an\ninstant feedback. HR practitioners can facilitate talent mobility and create\njobs inside the organization so that employees can shop for the same.\n\n### Solutions for Wellbeing\n\nWellbeing industry is becoming a performance oriented part of the company.\nWellbeing tools, algorithms, recommendations are providing good insights and\nhave been hugely successful.\n\n### Employee Engagement and Feedback\n\nEmployee engagement has always been an area of interest for the HR\npractitioners from past long. The interest began somewhere in the 1900s when\nindustrial engineers floated surveys to understand how to make the\nmanufacturing plants work better. There\u2019s no looking back since then and now\naction platform are making rounds- a system that takes the data and gives out\nthe results and intelligent recommendations based on the surveys. The data\ncollected can directly be fed to the managers so that both managers and\nemployees can take action. Josh also highlighted the importance of keeping\nemployees happy because happy employees will make customers happy.\n\n### Learning\n\nThere is disruption all over the place in learning- Learning Management\nSystems (LMS) is being gradually replaced by more intuitive experience tools.\nJosh talked about the three layers, which are\u2013 1) core HR tools, 2) LMS and 3)\nLearning experience tools (LXP). Some of the LXP tools are collaborative,\nwhile some are portals and discovery, while some are having an intelligent\nsearch mechanism. Josh also mentioned about \u2018Learning and the flow of work\u2019\nwhere employees want learning to come to them. It will influence the nature of\nlearning going forward.\n\n### People Analytics\n\nPeople Analytics have moved from a science experiment to a series of\nactionable programs that people can use. Decisions can be made by analyzing\ndata around retention and engagement. Now it is also possible to analyze data\nabout your network to make better decisions about how to manage people.\n\nJosh concluded the session by reiterating the importance of trust. He said\nthat after having all the data, organizations must build the data privacy\nstandards and reassure employees about how their data is protected.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR

LMS has emerged as\none of the hottest segments in the HR technology space. With over 700 vendors\nin the learning technologies space and mounting pressure to create unique\nproducts, it is no surprise that LMS companies are looking to expand their\nbusiness through strategic acquisitions.\n\nLeapest\u2019s acquisition will provide EdCast with 1,600 business customers and\nover 5,000 learning products and instructors from around the world. This move\nwill also bolster EdCast\u2019s\n[ContentExchange](https://ed.edcast.com/contentexchange/) platform, which\nhappens to be one of the largest learning content marketplaces in the world.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to add Leapest and its team to our expanding blended learning\nand ContentExchange capabilities,\u201d said Karl Mehta, CEO and founder of EdCast.\n\u201cEdCast is weaving together the key aspects of enterprise training on one\nintegrated Knowledge Cloud platform, creating a unique, critical ecosystem for\nlearning, training and knowledge management.\u201d\n\n## **Is the LMS Market Headed for Consolidation?**  \n\nThe adoption of cloud-based SaaS LMS\u2019 since the early \u201890s across the board\nlowered the barrier to entry for vendors. The cloud-enabled vendors to develop\nlow-cost learning solutions of limited scope to target a specific business\nproblem, industry or region. With digital transformation in full-swing,\norganizations invested heavily in improving their learning and development\n(L&D;) capabilities. This led to smaller, innovative vendors bagging a larger\nslice of the LMS market.\n\nMajor players in the L&D; segment such as LinkedIn, SAP, Cornerstone OnDemand,\nand Saba Software among others have taken an aggressive growth-by-acquisition\nroute to improve market share. In 2018 alone, there were 40 significant\nacquisitions in the learning technologies space. A few notable acquisitions\ninclude:\n\n  1.

Early LMS vendors focused solely\non developing technology that would facilitate learning. The learning content\nwas typically created by in-house L&D; teams, HR teams or external L&D;\nconsultants. However, with the emergence of massive open online courses\n(MOOCs), organizations gained easy access to both \u2013 technology and content.\nFor LMS vendors it meant that in order to stay competitive and relevant, they\nnot only needed to facilitate the delivery of learning content but also create\nlearning content that would improve overall learning outcomes. LinkedIn\u2019s\nacquisition of Lynda paved the way for other L&D; biggies to follow suit \u2013\ncreate end-to-end _learning experience platforms (LXP)_ that could address\nmost learning and training needs of an organization.\n\nThe Leapest acquisition underscores this trend \u2013 it helps EdCast bring a\nunique LXP offering to its clients. There is little doubt that the LMS market\nis on the cusp of disruption as learning experiences and content become key\ndrivers of success and innovation in the years to come.

Designed with the modern learner in\nmind, Inkling Learning Pathways seamlessly guides employees through the\ntraining process in a way that improves engagement, performance and\ninformation retention, while enabling managers to easily track and verify\ntrainee skills.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d8349f69f396.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nNearly half of employees say they prefer to learn on the job and at the point\nof need, according to the LinkedIn Learning 2018 Workplace Learning Report,\nwhich examines talent development trends in the new labor market. This reality\nsignals a call to rethink employee training since classroom settings and\ncomputer-based [learning management systems\n(LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/) are proving to be largely ineffective for the\nmodern learner.\n\n_**HR Tech News:**[Paul Esselman Named President by Cejka Executive\nSearch](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/leadership-succession/paul-\nesselman-named-president-by-cejka-executive-search/)_\n\n\"Most traditional LMS applications are designed to manage compliance and track\ncertifications, and are far too transactional and complex in nature to solve\ntoday's most critical training needs,\" said Inkling CEO Jeff Carr. \"Inkling is\nshifting the focus from learning management to learning enablement and a\nbetter learner experience with Inkling Learning Pathways. Created for the\nmodern employee, the product provides training and resources \u2013 accessible\nanytime, anywhere and on any device \u2013 to bridge the gap between learning and\ndoing. Inkling Learning Pathways will help employees achieve greater success\nin less time, improving their efficiency and job satisfaction.\"\n\nInkling Learning Pathways is an all-in-one solution that enables the creation\nof flexible, media-rich courses to engage learners and help them retain\ninformation faster. With an intuitive interface similar to familiar consumer\nmobile apps, the product easily guides employees through their training\nmodules. Managers are then able to drive accountability with trainer sign-off\nto verify trainees' skills. A central dashboard also provides managers with a\nstreamlined view of employee progress and allows them to assign additional\ncourses.\n\n_**HR Tech News:**[Orange Business Services Inaugurates its HR Innovation Lab\nto Boost Co-innovation within the HR\nFunction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/orange-\nbusiness-services-inaugurates-its-hr-innovation-lab-to-boost-coinnovation-\nwithin-the-hr-function/)_\n\nInkling Learning Pathways is a complementary solution to the company's\nflagship product, Inkling Knowledge. An enterprise knowledge management\nsolution, Inkling Knowledge enables content creation, storage, distribution,\nand measurement, making reference materials easily accessible through mobile\ndevices, when and where employees need it most.

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\n[ Brought to you by ](https://www.unboxedtechnology.com)\n\nBased on what we see happening in the L&D industry, here\u2019s a look at the top\nthree trends in training and development that you need to keep your eye on for\nthe coming year.  \n\n## **Trend #1: 360-Degree Certification**\n\nWe\u2019re long past the point of a certification exam or a series of inconsistent\nclasses being enough to guarantee readiness, let alone success. The future of\ncorporate learning lends itself toward a 360-degree view of certification.\n\nBy nature, 360-degree certification is holistic. Begin by identifying a\nthreshold that learners must meet before they are considered certified. Choose\ninputs that train and test knowledge, skills, and behavior.\n\nThen, use your [learning management\nsystem](https://unboxedtechnology.com/learning-management-system-lms) (LMS) to\ncreate a unique formula of weighted inputs to automate the employee\ncertification process. Inputs may include:  \n\n  * an in-person training event\n  * video role play\n  * coaching sessions or observation\n  * mini knowledge checks.\n\nThe list could go on but each input is used in combination with the others to\ncollectively \u201ccertify\u201d your rep.\n\nDon\u2019t stop at a one-time certification. [Track employee\ntraining](https://unboxedtechnology.com/how-to-track-employee-training/) and\nrecertify reps with [refresher\ncourses](https://unboxedtechnology.com/employee-training/custom/refresher) at\nvarious checkpoints in their careers to ensure knowledge retention over time.\nReimagine how this will transform what \u201ccustomer readiness\u201d means for new\nhires and veteran employees.  \n\n##  **Trend #2: More Innovative Event Management**\n\nAn LMS that is effectively being used is an integral part of an employee\u2019s\ndevelopment. If you\u2019re not leveraging your learning platform for event\nmanagement to pulse engaging pre-work, drive community traffic, and gamify\ntraining events with ongoing opportunities to earn points and rewards, now is\nthe time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGames during training is one of those learning trends that will become more\ninfluential every year. Use games and gamification at events to educate,\nimprove the experience, and fight disengagement as well as create an\nenvironment of collaboration and healthy competition.\n\nFor example, a pharmaceutical national sales meeting is a great event to\n[impleme](https://unboxedtechnology.com/5-ways-to-utilize-e-learning-games-in-\nemployee-training/)[nt games and\ngamification](https://unboxedtechnology.com/5-ways-to-utilize-e-learning-\ngames-in-employee-training/) into. Use an LMS to award points or badges for\nvarious activities so participants can win a grand prize. Possible activities\ncan include:  \n\n  * attending various sessions\n  * tweeting what they learned using an event-branded hashtag\n  * networking with other attendees by exchanging business cards.\n\nDisengaged learners are the bane of any event\u2019s existence. The bottom line:\nCraft a learning culture that motivates and engages employees with the help of\nan LMS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **Trend #3: Personalized Learning Through AI**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is no stranger to L&D or the world at this point.\n\nAI at Work, a study conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace, discovered only\n6 percent of HR professionals are currently using AI in the workplace despite\nthat HR leaders believe AI will positively affect both L&D (27 percent) and\nperformance management (26 percent) over the next two years.\n\nWhen AI is implemented into an LMS, it creates a personalized learning\nenvironment that becomes more intelligent over time. AI can improve employees\u2019\nlearning experiences by:  \n\n  * identifying knowledge gaps in training then recommend the programs needed to strengthen that particular area.\n  * creating a [personalized course path using a blended learning](https://unboxedtechnology.com/blended-learning-the-way-it-should-be/) approach and selecting the right modality for training content.\n  * measuring training effectiveness through facial recognition to track what is being practically applied on the field.\n\nThe future of AI in the L&D space is limitless. If you don\u2019t start adopting AI\ntechnology into your training now, you\u2019ll be limiting the potential of your\nbusiness and employees later.  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [E-Learning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=E-Learning)\n  * [Emerging Tech](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Emerging%20Tech)\n  * [Games & Gamification](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Games%20%26%20Gamification)\n  * [Learning Technologies](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Learning%20Technologies)\n  * [Tools & Platforms](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Tools%20%26%20Platforms)\n\n2 Comments\n\nSign In to Post a Comment\n\n[Sign In](https://www.td.org/sign-\nin?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.td.org%2Finsights%2F2020-training-trends-whats-\nreally-worth-your-investment)\n\n[SN](https://www.td.org/user/about/SomNanda-000001)\n\nSom Nanda\n\nJanuary 06, 2020 04:27 AM\n\nExcellent article.

The LMS will dissolve and combine with Southeast\nAsia's LST toa form a new league \u2014 the SEA Tour.\n\n\"During the past several months, Garena and Riot Games have been evaluating\nthe professional competitive ecosystem for League of Legends across Southeast\nAsia and the LMS region. Our goal is to continue to increase the level of\ncompetition and create a more engaging experience for fans,\" Riot\n[said](https://www.facebook.com/lolph/photos/a.154669697885999/2758969037456039/?type=3&theater)\non the official LoL SEA Facebook page.\n\nThe development is in line with earlier reports that the LMS will cease to\nexist. Recently, Hong Kong Attitude's founder Derek Cheung [spoke in a\nvideo](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5uhu1/chawy_banned_from_taiwan_due_to_visa_issues_lms/)\nabout the state of his team and also added that \"this [2019] season could very\nwell be the last LMS season.\" The reason is mostly the rapid decline of\ncompetitiveness in the region, leading to the argument that the LMS doesn't\ndeserve its three World Championship spots anymore and should be demoted.\nCombined with the receding viewership numbers for the league, the dissolution\nof LMS seemed very probable.\n\n\"We believe that the formation of the new league, which brings the best of\nHong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Southeast Asia to a common stage, will allow\nparticipating teams to reach a broader audience and increase the\ncompetitiveness of the region while expanding the talent pool. Centralizing\nthe competitive ecosystem will also increase business and media opportunities\nfor teams,\" Riot Games added.\n\nThe new league will now feature a total of eight countries: Taiwan, Hong Kong,\nMacau, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, covering up\nthe majority of the Southeast Asian region, with the exception of Vietnam,\nwhich has its own league.

Amazon recently\nannounced it was [investing $700 million to reskill 100,000 of its\nemployees](/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-\ndevelopment/pages/amazon-commits-to-investing-millions-in-training.aspx) in\nareas like machine learning and robotics. AT&T is in the midst of a $1 billion\ninvestment to retrain its workforce as it transforms from a company focused on\nfiber-optic cables and telephone switches into a digital business. Countless\nother midsize and smaller organizations also are retraining to keep their\nworkers' skills current in the digital age.\n\nMany are turning to new digital learning technologies to help employees\nacquire skills in ways that are minimally disruptive to their daily work\nlives, to create more-personalized learning paths, and to help coach and\nmentor workers in more efficient ways.\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Developing Employee Career Paths and\nLadders_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/developingemployeecareerpathsandladders.aspx?_ga=2.27701436.1834625870.1562593227-920689375.1491920969)\n_] _\n\nReskilling Needs Grow\n\nRecent research underscores the need for reskilling. A study from the World\nEconomic Forum found that 54 percent of employees will need significant\nreskilling by 2022, largely because changing technology will add new demands\nto their roles or make current job descriptions obsolete.\n\nIn its _2019 Global Human Capital Trends_ report, consultancy Bersin, Deloitte\nfound that while some jobs are disappearing due to technology\u201438 percent of\nsurvey respondents expect to eliminate certain jobs due to automation in the\nnext three years\u2014many more roles are being transformed by technology.\n\nEighty-four percent of respondents to the Bersin study who said automation\nwould require employee retraining reported that they had increased funding for\nsuch reskilling, while 77 percent said they also were increasing the headcount\nin their learning department, making learning the second-fastest-growing role\nin HR.\n\n\"If you consider that the length of careers is increasing as people work\nlonger at the same time the half-life of job skills is decreasing, you can see\nwhy companies are focused on reskilling existing employees,\" said Julie\nHiipakka, vice president of learning research for Bersin, Deloitte Consulting.\n\"Organizations are recognizing that the best way to get the skills they need\noften is to help the people they already have evolve and adapt.\"\n\nNew Ways to Learn\n\nTraining methods of the past that relied on one-size-fits-all approaches to\neducate employees\u2014or that required workers to take significant time away from\njobs to attend courses\u2014are being abandoned in favor of digital learning\nplatforms that can deliver just the learning workers need at the right time\nand place, experts say.\n\n\"We're seeing more organizations look to technology as a significant part of\ntheir reskilling conversations, which has translated to a larger investment in\ncontent-related learning technologies,\" said Stacey Harris, vice president of\nresearch and analytics for Sierra-Cedar, a technical consulting firm in\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\nWhile the venerable learning management system (LMS) remains the backbone of\nmany technology ecosystems, its role has diminished as new content-driven\ntechnologies help organizations deliver training in more user-friendly and\nagile ways.\n\n\"Organizations are increasingly looking to complement their LMS and push it\nfurther into the background,\" Hiipakka said. \"The LMS still plays an important\nrecordkeeping and compliance role to document that certain training has been\ncompleted, but it's become a less visible part of what employees engage with\nto learn.\"\n\nMany forward-thinking companies are adopting learning experience platforms\n(LXPs) as an alternative to the LMS, experts say. Rather than specializing in\ncompliance issues or learning course catalog management, the LXP is more of a\ncontent-delivery system that can incorporate things like video-based learning\nor enable content to be integrated into mainstream work systems to offer on-\ndemand learning.\n\n\"More learning leaders we talk to today are using an LXP rather than an LMS,\"\nsaid Dani Johnson, co-founder and principal analyst for RedThread Research, a\nhuman capital research and advisory firm.\n\nCompanies are increasingly mixing and matching learning technologies from\ndifferent vendors in \"open\" ecosystems designed to capitalize on the strengths\nof disparate systems. For example, an organization might employ a mix of\nlearning vendors that includes providers like Axonify to deliver five- or\n10-minute micro-learning to front-line employees within their flow of daily\nwork; a platform like WalkMe to help employees learn new or complex software\nsystems in short timeframes; or a system like Degreed to connect employees to\ncurated learning resources like courses, videos, articles, books or podcasts.\n\nExperts say there's a renewed focus on enabling employees to learn on the job\nin small doses through micro-learning, via collaboration tools where they can\neasily pose questions to peers and through on-demand content libraries.\n\nHiipakka calls this focus \"learning in the flow of work,\" an understanding\nthat learning and work are two constantly connected sides of every job. That's\nwhy she thinks micro-learning, for example, should be integrated into\nmainstream work systems so employees aren't forced to log into a separate\nlearning system to access it.\n\nJohnson also is seeing more learning technologies geared toward creating and\ntracking certifications as well as platforms focused on coaching and\nmentoring. Sierra-Cedar's _2018-2019 HR Systems Survey_ found growth in\ntechnologies that track industry certifications as well as those that help\nemployees created personalized development plans.\n\nGiven the burgeoning number of learning options, organizations often need\nguidance in choosing the best technology platforms for their needs. Companies\nlike [Conduent Learning Services](https://www.conduent.com/hr-services/) in\nAsheville, N.C., help HR leaders sift through the choices.\n\nConduent assesses a company's regulatory climate, the demographics of its\nemployees, the technology environment, which workers have regular access to\nwhat devices\u2014along with the specific business challenges the company faces\u2014to\nprescribe a mix of learning technologies, said Leo Blankenship, vice president\nand learning offerings leader at Conduent.\n\n\"Ultimately the goal should be to help your employees learn when they want to,\nwhere they want to and how they want to, whether that training be digital or\nanalog,\" Blankenship said.\n\nThe Human Element\n\nSome learning content providers believe the human element still plays a\ncrucial role in learning effectiveness. One such company is AVADO, a London-\nbased learning content provider, which in its online courses for subjects like\ndata analytics or leadership development uses a purposeful mix of self-\ndirected and group-based techniques involving facilitators or online\ninstructors.\n\n\"Self-directed online learning alone doesn't meet learner needs in all types\nof scenarios,\" said Niall McKinney, global president of AVADO. \"Our approach\nis you need a blend of different experiences, such as combining on-demand\ncontent with some live classes that are streamed and involve group work. We\nfind many people still learn better in environments where they learn with\nother people.\"\n\n _Dave Zielinski is a freelance writer and editor in Minneapolis._  \n\n[Organization and Employee\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and Employee\nDevelopment) [Technology](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=New+Learning+Technologies+Drive+Reskilling+Initiatives&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/New-Learning-Technologies-Drive-Reskilling-\nInitiatives.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.
