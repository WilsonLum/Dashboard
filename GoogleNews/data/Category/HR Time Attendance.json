With the Virus outbreak now\nreaching over 110+ countries and affecting more than 150,000 people; the\nconcern around employee safety and health has gained paramount importance.  \n  \nThe Ramco Innovation Lab unveiled the innovation which drew upon its own\nfacial recognition-based attendance system deployed across multiple\norganizations, globally and combined it with a thermal imaging device for\ntemperature measurement as well as other associated software. This enables\norganizations to track staff or visitors with high temperatures that may\nindicate infection and build in operating procedures to avoid further\ncontaminations caused by finger/thumb based biometric scanners. Ramco Systems,\nheadquartered in Chennai, India, is a global enterprise software specialist\nwhich has pioneered many HR-related innovations.  \n  \nRamcoGEEK for Attendance with Temperature capturing can:  \n  \n\\- Detect and match the faces of staff members and mark their attendance along\nwith temperature; where facial based attendance is a privacy concern,\nenterprises can replace it with Voice to register access  \n  \n\\- System is linked to an loT sensor powered door which can restrict access in\ncase the temperature is higher than normal and auto apply leave on behalf of\nthe employee  \n  \n\\- Communicate the information to HR and management in real-time  \n  \n\\- Track the movements of a high-temperature staff in the workplace  \n  \n **RamcoGEEK for Visitors can:**  \n  \n\\- Send notifications when RamcoGEEK encounters a person with a very high\ntemperature to the Facility Manager! Facility Admin  \n  \n\\- Track the movement of that person within that premise  \n  \n **RamcoGEEK for Contact Tracing can:**  \n  \n\\- Send notifications / Alerts to all those employees, customers, vendors and\nothers interacted with in-person, in the event any person develops COVID-19\nsymptoms! diagnosed  \n  \n\\- The Track and Trace system is capable of reading Outlook calendar, Credit\ncard spend data, trip details from Uber Lyft and Grab (subject to permission)\nto identify people met, Hotels stayed, Flights taken, Taxi drivers used and\nuse this information to help identify employees at risk.  \n  \n\\- Reverse tracing can also be initiated based on data around positive\nCOVID-19 cases from external environment - for instance, a positive case of\nCOVlD-19 at a restaurant can alert all employees who have dined at the\nrestaurant to be quarantined (based on bills raised)  \n  \n\\- Help HR set up its own procedures to seek recent movements of the affected\nperson, based on the information provided by the attendance system  \n  \n\\- This piece of software could be leveraged provided RamcoGEEK could get\naccess to the data specified above. And these data could be stored in\norganization's premises or could leverage Ramco's cloud for storing the same.  \n  \n\\- Support authorities with essential information, if needed (e.g., to\nfacilitate contact-tracing)  \n  \n\"We have a major global health pandemic that has affected many. The spread of\nthe disease has brought the focus back on Hygiene and Health of Employees. We\nbuilt this application to help better address a crisis through technology.\nRobust containment through a robust attendance and access system with zero\ncontact and temperature measurement can be key to avoid easy spread of the\nvirus that may take place with Biometric access system\" said Mr. Virender\nAggarwal, CEO - Ramco Systems.  \n  \n\"The launch of the advanced facial attendance system by Ramco Systems is\ntimely, given global concerns over pandemic threats. We continue to see\ncompanies undertake a spectrum of innovation activities from Singapore, as\nthey develop new products and solutions to address the needs arid challenges\nof today,\" said Ms. Junie Fo, Director, Investment Facilitation, Singapore\nEconomic Development Board (EDB).  \n  \nComplete with chatbots, voice, and facial recognition-based workforce\nmanagement, organizations can deploy Ramco HR with Global Payroll on-cloud, on\npremise or leverage as a managed service. The multi - tenant architecture with\nembedded intelligence and device agnostics features now serves more than 500+\nclients worldwide. With innovative concepts of Artificial Intelligence &\nMachine learning, Context-sensitive Pop-ups and Chatbots to carry out self-\nservice, and Voice based HR transactions on Google Assistant & Alexa, Ramco\nhas been setting the benchmark for Innovation in this segment. With statutory\ncompliance across 45+ countries covering ANZ, Asia (including Japan & China),\nMiddle-East & Africa, UK and Ireland, Ramco's Global Payroll is available in\nEnglish, Japanese, Mandarin, Bahasa, Thai, Malay, Arabic among others.  \n  \nShares of RAMCO SYSTEMS LTD. was last trading in BSE at Rs.83.5 as compared to\nthe previous close of Rs. 87.55. The total number of shares traded during the\nday was 7204 in over 268 trades.  \n  \nThe stock hit an intraday high of Rs. 92 and intraday low of 80. The net\nturnover during the day was Rs. 627801.  \n  \n  \nSource: **Equity Bulls**  \n  \n  \n[Click here to send ur comments](mailto:feedback@equitybulls.com) or to\nfeedback@equitybulls.com  \n

cloud-based Human Resource\nManagement (HRM) solution, [EmpIX](http://www.emplx.com/) can help to\nalleviate the challenges faced by HR managers due to Covid-19.**  \n  \n**Khoo Siew Ling, CEO of MyWave Sdn Bhd** said, \u201cThese are unprecedented times\nfor those handling HR. Now and more than ever, they need to rely on technology\nto ensure smooth HR management. With the Movement Control Order (MCO) now\nenforced in Malaysia, HR managers play an important role and one of the\nimmediate challenges they face is in the areas of managing employees\u2019\nattendance and payroll.\u201d  \n  \nHR managers need to find ways to remotely fulfil their responsibilities since\nmost business premises being ordered to close during this period, without\nbeing able to access the usual systems and documentation in the office. This\ninclude tracking attendance of staff working from home, handling unpaid or\nsick leave of impacted staff, and processing payroll and claims.\n\nWith MyWave\u2019s cloud-based HRM solution, HR managers can access all the data\nthey need anytime and anywhere, with minimal interaction and data entry\nrequired. By using EmpIX\u2019 mobile attendance system, employee attendance\ntracking can be done, and staff can submit claims from home by uploading\nphotograph of receipts into the system.\n\nKhoo stressed that as the coming months are still shrouded with uncertainty\nand there may be changes in the treatment of income tax and Employee\u2019s\nProvident Fund (EPF), HR managers will need easy-to-use technology solutions\nto enable them to quickly comply to the new guidelines and rulings. For those\nin the manufacturing, food and beverage, and logistic industries where\nmanpower are mainly on shifts, digitisation of HR is crucial for business\nsurvival and can help businesses save as much as 60 percent processing time.\n\n\u201cOur outsourcing services can also aid companies in applying for the RM600\nunpaid leave allowance announced by the government as well as in handling the\nissues of staff retrenchment and pay deduction. Additionally, SMEs which are\nshorthanded, or if they do not have a dedicated person to handle HR, can\nconsider outsourcing their payroll function to us\u201d, said Khoo.\n\nMyWave is one of the HR Payroll technology solution providers listed in the\n[SME Business Digitization Grant](https://mdec.my/digital-economy-\ninitiatives/for-the-industry/sme-digitalisation-grant/) launched by Malaysia\nDigital Economy Corporation (MDEC) recently where the government will provide\na 50 percent matching grant of up to RM5,000 per company for SMEs applying to\nupgrade their systems.\n\n[Tweet](http://twitter.com/share)\n\nPRESS RELEASES\n\n  * [2020](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2020)\n  * [2019](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2019)\n  * [2018](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2018)\n  * [2017](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2017)\n  * [2016](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2016)\n  * [2015](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2015)\n  * [2014](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2014)\n  * [2013](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2013)\n  * [2012](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2012)\n  * [2011](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2011)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n# Advertisement Here\n\n## Advertisement\n\n![](https://datastorageasean.com/sites/all/themes/storage/images/logo_bottom.png)\n\n  * [Home](https://datastorageasean.com)\n  * [News](https://datastorageasean.com/news)\n  * [Features](https://datastorageasean.com/features)\n  * [Research](https://datastorageasean.com/research)\n  * [Bloggers](https://datastorageasean.com/community_vendor_page)\n  * [Big Data](/category/big-data)\n  * [Cloud Storage](/category/cloud-storage)\n  * [Storage And Virtualization](/category/storage-and-virtualization)\n  * [Network Storage](/category/network-storage)\n  * [Data Backup](/category/data-backup)\n  * [Data Protection](/category/data-protection)\n  * [Data Storage Management](/category/data-storage-management)\n  *   \n[Storage Strategy](/category/storage-strategy)\n\n  * [Privacy](https://datastorageasean.com/privacy-policy)\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Asia Online Publishing Group Sdn.

The RamcoGEEK facial recognition system uses IoT based sensor doors,\nenabling organizations to move towards 'Touch-less' attendance and workplace\naccess in the wake of COVID-19, and the focus back on 'Hygiene'. Ramco will\noffer the new system on a subsidized basis to Singapore enterprise (250+\nemployees), expressing gratitude to the city and its workforce where the\nInnovation Lab and Regional HQ are based.  \n  \n![](http://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Temperature-Recording-inner-\nbanner-600.jpg)  \n---  \n  \n  \nThe Ramco Innovation Lab introduced today's innovation based on Ramco's own\nfacial-recognition attendance system, deployed globally across numerous\norganizations, combined with a thermal imaging device for temperature\nmeasurement and associated software. This enables organizations to track staff\nor visitors with high temperatures that may indicate infection, and build\nprocedures to avoid further contamination caused by biometric scanners. Ramco\nSystems, headquartered in Chennai, India, is a global enterprise software\nspecialist which has pioneered many HR-related innovations.  \n  \nRamcoGEEK for Attendance with Temperature Capturing can detect and match the\nfaces of staff members and mark their attendance along with temperature. Where\nfacial-based attendance is a privacy concern, enterprises can replace it with\nvoice to register access. The system is linked to IoT sensor-powered doors\nwhich can restrict access in cases where temperature is higher than normal and\nauto apply leave on behalf of employees. It communicates the information to HR\nand management in real-time and tracks the movements of a high-temperature\nstaff in the workplace.  \n  \nRamcoGEEK for Visitors system can send notifications when it encounters a\nperson with a very high temperature to the facility manager/facility admin and\ntrack the movement of that person within that premise.  \n  \nRamcoGEEK for Contact Tracing can send notifications to all those employees,\ncustomers, vendors and others interacted with in-person, in the event any\nperson develops COVID-19 symptoms. Reverse Tracing can also be initiated based\non data around positive COVID-19 cases from the external environment. For\nexample, in a positive case of COVID-19 at a restaurant, RamcoGEEK can alert\nemployees who dined at the restaurant to be quarantined based on bills raised.  \n  \n\"We have a major global health pandemic that has affected many. The spread of\nthe disease has brought the focus back on Hygiene and Health of Employees. We\nbuilt this application to help better address a crisis through technology.\nRobust containment through a robust attendance and access system with zero\ncontact and temperature measurement can be a key to avoiding easy spread of\nthe virus that can take place with a Biometric access system,\" said Mr.\nVirender Aggarwal, CEO of Ramco Systems.  \n  \n\"The launch of the advanced facial attendance system by Ramco Systems is\ntimely, given global concerns over pandemic threats. We continue to see\ncompanies undertake a spectrum of innovation activities from Singapore, as\nthey develop new products and solutions to address the needs and challenges of\ntoday,\" said Ms. Junie Fo, Director of Investment Facilitation at the Economic\nDevelopment Board (EDB), which is backing the new Innovation Lab in Singapore.  \n  \nComplete with chatbots, voice and facial recognition-based workforce\nmanagement, organizations can deploy Ramco's HR with Global Payroll on-cloud,\non premise or leverage as a managed service. The multi-tenant architecture\nwith embedded intelligence and device agnostic features now serves more than\n500+ clients worldwide. With innovative concepts in artificial intelligence\n(AI) & machine learning, context-sensitive pop-ups and chatbots as self-\nservice customer support, and voice-activated HR transactions based on Google\nAssistant & Alexa, Ramco has been setting the benchmark for innovation in this\nsegment.  \n  \nWith statutory compliance across 45+ countries covering ANZ, Asia including\nJapan & China, Middle-East & Africa, UK and Ireland, Ramco's HR with Global\nPayroll is available in English, Japanese, Mandarin, Bahasa, Thai, Malay and\nArabic, among others.

The CDC estimated there were as many as 60.8 million cases of H1N1 in\nthe U.S. during the 2009-2010 timeframe. Of those cases, over 250,000 needed\nto be hospitalized, and approximately 12,500 deaths were attributed to H1N1.\nChildren and young adults were at greatest risk during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.\nMany may remember schools, day care centers, summer camps, and universities\nclosed down to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu. During that time, the federal\ngovernment\u2019s many agencies developed pandemic plans and policies, as did\nbusinesses. With what is happening now in the U.S., the time has come for\nbusinesses to update those policies for what appears to be a possible Covid-19\npandemic.\n\nThe Covid-19 virus is highly infectious, but its symptoms tend to be mild in\nmost (80 percent) of people. It does not present as a runny nose or nasal\ncongestion. Rather, 90 percent of patients have a fever and 70 percent have a\ndry cough. Those who are acutely ill usually experience shortness of breath.\nFor people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or\ncompromised immune systems, Covid-19 is causing severe illness and, for some,\ndeath. As a result, this possible pandemic is impacting the elderly more than\nchildren and anyone already suffering from a chronic illness. In fact, the\nWorld Health Organization reported that few children contracted the disease in\nChina and none of those died.

It is also important to remember public health orders can trump all\nother relevant laws, especially when they impose a quarantine.\n\n(See:\n[www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html](http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html))\n\n1\\. Actively encourage employees with respiratory illness and fever to stay\nhome until they are free of a fever for at least 24 hours. You may still\nrequire they notify their supervisor daily.\n\n2\\. Ensure that your sick leave policies are modified to be flexible enough\nthey are consistent with any public health guidance and employees are aware of\nthese modified policies.\n\n3\\. Talk with companies that provide your business with contract or temporary\nemployees about the importance of their sick employees staying home and\nencourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies consistent with CDC\nguidelines.\n\n4\\. Consider whether you really need to require a health care provider\u2019s note\nfor employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their\nillness, as health care provider offices and medical facilities may be\nextremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.\n_(One useful approach during a pandemic may be to only require notes of those\nwho have a record of excessive absences._.\n\n5\\. Employers should have flexible policies permitting employees to stay home\nto care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware more employees may\nneed to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members\nthan usual.\n\n6\\. Be prepared to separate sick employees. The CDC recommends employees who\nappear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e., cough, shortness of\nbreath) upon arrival to work, or become sick during the day, should be\nseparated from other employees and sent home immediately. Sick employees\nshould be told to cover their noses and mouths with a tissue when coughing or\nsneezing (or an elbow or shoulder if no tissue is available).\n\n7\\. Place posters in the workplace that: a) encourage staying at home when\nsick; b) explain the proper etiquette for coughing & sneezing; c) explain hand\nhygiene when entering the work place or other working areas; c) explain how to\nwash hands; d) how to use anti-bacterial gels; and e) explain employees should\nuse soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n\n8\\. Provide tissues & no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees.\nProvide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60-95 percent alcohol. Ensure\nsupplies maintained in multiple locations or in conference rooms.\n\n9\\. Perform routine environmental cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces\n- workstations, countertops, doorknobs. No additional disinfection beyond\nroutine cleaning is recommended at this time.\n\n10\\. Provide disposable wipes so commonly used surfaces (for example,\ndoorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks) can be wiped down by employees\nbefore each use.\n\n11\\. For employees who are travelling, check the [CDC\u2019s Traveler\u2019s Health\nNotices](https://www.cdc.gov/travel) for guidance on each country of travel.\nSpecific travel information for travelers going to & returning from China and\ninformation for aircrew, can be found on the [CDC\nwebsite](///C:/Users/klanning/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/5RTEA5T1/continent':%20'6255149',%20'country':%20'6252001',%20'state':%20'',%20'region':%20').\nAdvise employees to check themselves for symptoms of [acute respiratory\nillness](///C:/Users/klanning/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/5RTEA5T1/continent':%20'6255149',%20'country':%20'6252001',%20'state':%20'',%20'region':%20')\nbefore starting travel, notify their supervisor, and stay home if they are\nsick.\n\n12\\. Ensure employees who become sick while traveling or on temporary\nassignment understand they should notify their supervisor and promptly call a\nhealth care provider for advice if needed.\n\n13\\. Employees who are well but have a sick family member at home with\nCOVID-19 should notify their supervisor and refer to CDC guidance for [how to\nconduct a risk assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-\nassessment.html) of their potential exposure.\n\n14\\. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform\nfellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19, and maintain\nconfidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and\nHIPAA. Employees exposed to a co-worker with confirmed COVID-19 should refer\nto CDC guidance for [how to conduct a risk\nassessment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-\nassessment.html) of their potential exposure.\n\n15\\. Consider how best to decrease the spread of acute respiratory illness and\nlower the impact of COVID-19 in their workplace in the event of a more severe\noutbreak in the U.S. Identify & communicate objectives, which may include one\nor more of the following:\n\n  1. reducing transmission among staff _( i.e., via social distancing or working from home);_\n\n  2. protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications _(i.e,. permitting offering accommodations for higher risk individuals until pandemic situation has passed);_\n\n  3. maintaining minimum business operations; and\n\n  4. minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.\n\n16\\. Some key considerations when making decisions on appropriate responses\ninclude the following:\n\n(a) Disease severity in the community where the business is located;\n\n(b) Impact of disease on employees who are vulnerable & at higher risk for\nadverse health complications.;\n\n(c) Prepare for possible increased numbers of employee absences due to illness\n\nof employees and their family members or dismissals or closures of schools;\n\n(d) Monitor & respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to\ncontinue your essential business functions in case you experience higher than\nusual absenteeism;\n\ne) Cross-train personnel to perform essential functions so the workplace is\nable to operate even if key staff members are absent;\n\nf) Assess essential functions & reliance others place on your services or\nproducts. Be prepared to change your business practices, if needed, to\nmaintain critical operations (i.e., alternative suppliers, prioritize\ncustomers, or temporarily suspend some of your operations if needed);\n\ng) If you have more than one business location, provide local managers with\nauthority to take appropriate actions based on the conditions in their\nlocality; and\n\nh) Coordinate with state & local health officials.\n\n**C. Other Possible Suggestions Not Yet Recommended by the CDC** 1\\. If your\nemployees travel by car, consider outfitting them with supplies to protect\nthem while stopping to refuel.\n\n2\\. Encourage employees to practice the six foot rule -when in public spaces\nand they notice someone with symptoms, encourage them to keep a six-foot\ndistance to lessen their risk.\n\n3\\. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as more and more people became infected,\nthe CDC suggested screening employees when they arrived at work. Currently,\nthe CDC recommends this for employers in health care, death care, waste\nmanagement, sold waste, airline travel, border patrol, and international\ntravel businesses.\n\n4\\. Another recommendation of the CDC in 2009 was one that is available under\nthe ADA, which is making appropriate plans for changing the work duties, work\nspaces, or schedules for employees at higher risk for complications from\nCovid-19.\n\n5\\. As your business explores ways to increase social distancing at work,\nconsider the following tools: a) Cancel non-essential face-to-face meetings;\nb) Cancel non-essential business travel; c) Use conference calling; and d)\nOffer tele-work or flexible hour options.\n\n### **The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nFMLA covers employers with 50 employees or more within a 75 mile radius. To be\neligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for 12\nmonths (and at least 1,250 hours) Under FMLA, employers must provide employees\nwith up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a spouse, son/daughter, or parent\nwith a serious health condition or for the employee\u2019s own serious health\ncondition. Employers should anticipate that health care providers will likely\nview being quarantined as a result of Covid-19, or caring for someone\nseriously ill from the virus, as meeting the definition of a serious health\ncondition.\n\nEven if Covid-19 is at issue, the employer can still require employees to give\nthe employer notice as soon as practical, require the absent employee comply\nwith the employer\u2019s daily call-in procedures, and provide information to\nsupport that absence is due to a serious health condition, and the probable\nlength of absence. If your locality is particularly hard hit, employers may\nneed to consider relaxing some of FMLA\u2019s deadlines for the return of various\nmedical information if providers are simply overwhelmed.\n\nEmployers need to inform employees if leave will be FMLA protected and the\namount of leave to be counted against their FMLA leave time. If the employer\ndetermines a requested leave will not be covered by FMLA, they\u2019ll need to\ninform the employee of that as well. At option of either the employee or the\nemployer, FMLA allows substituting any accrued paid leave for unpaid leave. In\nfact, the employer can require an employee use accrued paid leave while also\ncounting the absence as FMLA leave.\n\n### **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**\n\nThe ADA generally applies if the employer has 15 or more employees. The ADA\nprotects a disabled person from discrimination in the workplace when he/she is\nqualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a\nreasonable accommodation. A disability is any physical or mental impairment\nthat substantially limits one or more of an individual\u2019s life activities.\nReasonable accommodations can include: Rearranging existing facilities or\nworkplaces; Job restructuring; part time, modified or flex time schedules;\nadjustment of policies; Reassignment to a vacant position; and/or A leave of\nabsence. However, an accommodation is not reasonable if it imposes an undue\nhardship on the employer.\n\nDetermining what is reasonable requires an informal interactive process. An\nemployer need not agree to a particular accommodation requested if it is\nunreasonable. Furthermore, if an employee refuses a reasonable accommodation\nand cannot perform the essential functions of job, he/she is no longer a\nqualified person under ADA.\n\nPersons with chronic health conditions (diabetes, cancer, coronary heart\ndisease, immune deficiency disorders, etc.) may, depending on individual\ncircumstances, qualify as disabled or be perceived to be disabled and there is\nlittle dispute they are at higher risk of complications with Covid-19. Thus,\nthe ADA will likely play an important role for employers during this potential\npandemic.\n\nThis begs the question: _If you are aware of an employee\u2019s chronic health\ncondition, may you lawfully inform others of an employee\u2019s health condition\nand their possible need for an accommodation?_ Once a person is hired, an\nemployer may inform supervisors and managers of necessary restrictions or\naccommodations. The law also allows an employer to inform first aid and safety\npersonnel when appropriate. However, the ADA says nothing about allowing the\nsharing of information with co-workers. Thus, if the employee seeks an\naccommodation, you would be able to discuss the issue with the employee and\nhis/her manager or supervisor to work out an accommodation that reduces risk.\n\n_What about taking the initiative, with the best of intentions, to ferret out\npersons with chronic illnesses ahead of time, so you can help them?_ While the\nADA allows pre-employment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to\nperform job related functions, it does not allow an employer to require\nresponses to medical inquiries for current employees unless it is job related\nand consistent with business necessity. There is some good news though, the\nADA does allow for some planning in situations like this. An employer can\nconduct voluntary medical histories, subject to confidentiality requirements.\nSpecifically, an employer can survey its workforce for personal information\nneeded for pandemic preparation but only if employer asks broad questions, not\nlimited to disability-related inquiries.\n\nAttachment A is an example of a sample ADA compliant survey acceptable in\n2009. Such a compliant survey could be prepared by a business for a possible\nCovid-19 pandemic. You can also consider whether it would be helpful to\nannounce in advance that absences for up to seven days will be excused for all\npersons who self-disclose in the survey.\n\nFinally, nothing in the ADA prohibits the employer from adopting non-invasive\ninfection control practices at work, such as: 1) Requiring regular hand\nwashing, as well as coughing and sneezing etiquette; 2) Tissue usage and\ndisposal etiquette; 3) Personal protective equipment (i.e., face mask, gloves,\ngown), although the employer may need to accommodate for allergies due to\nlatex and provide modified gowns for use with wheelchairs; and 3) Encourage or\nrequire tele-work.\n\nSeparated workspace and tele-work may also be considered reasonable\naccommodations for persons needing an accommodation during the pandemic. Note\nalso, employers must not discriminate against any protected class in\nrequiring, granting, or denying tele-work options.\n\n### **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**\n\nThe FLSA regulates hours and wages of employees engaged in interstate\ncommerce. It sets statutory minimum wages for all hours worked and requires\novertime pay for hours over 40 in a work week. Employing someone means \u201cto\nsuffer or permit to work,\u201d which becomes important in these situations.\nEmployees doing non-requested work, with the knowledge of employer, must be\npaid, and that includes \u201chomework\u201d performed with employer\u2019s knowledge, unless\nit is work done by an exempt employee.\n\nUnder FLSA, it is the employer\u2019s duty to stop an employee from doing work the\nemployer does not want done. FLSA also requires these policies to be\n\u201cpublished\u201d to employees with specific instructions on how long to work. FLSA\ndoes not require paid sick leave. As such, paid absences do not count as work\ntime under FLSA. However, on duty time spent waiting for work counts as work\ntime, and \u201ccomp time in lieu of overtime\u201d must be limited to the same pay\nperiod, which obviously restricts the future use of comp time. All of this\nrequires very careful recordkeeping. Employees are not allowed to waive their\nright to overtime or minimum wage, even in emergency or crisis situations.\nFinally, employees cannot volunteer their work time to an employer.\n\nIf an employer is going to permit non-exempt employees to work from home,\nthere must be clear instructions, in writing, about the number of hours being\nworked, including wait times. For all employees paid by the hour, since they\nwill be working in their residence, there should be clear guidelines about\nwhether mealtime and breaks will be paid while the employee is working from\nhome. Careful records of time should be kept and reviewed regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the office or plant, keep track of overtime hours for\npersons having to stay longer hours due to substantial absences of others.\nMonitor exempt employees working longer hours so they do not fall below\nminimum wage. Remember exempt employees who take over the manual job duties of\nnon-exempt employees may become subject to overtime provisions. _(Even if the\nexempt employee does not complain or seek it, a union official or disgruntled\nemployee can report the situation to the USDOL)._ Finally, FLSA does not limit\nthe types of work employees may be assigned or required to perform, except for\npersons age 17 or younger.\n\n### **Workers\u2019 Compensation Issues**\n\nState Workers\u2019 Compensation laws are designed to offer medical and financial\nbenefits to workers \"injured\" in the scope of their employment. This includes\nphysical injuries resulting from accidents on the job _(many states have\neliminated the \"accidental\" requirement)_ , as well as occupational diseases\ndue to causes and conditions characteristic of, and peculiar to, a particular\noccupation. Employees claiming on the job exposure to communicable diseases,\ntesting either positive or negative, have been awarded benefits. The typical\nemployee is usually a health care worker, prison guard, or housekeeper in a\nfacility housing persons who have communicable diseases.\n\nFor an accidental injury, an employee must prove when and where the\ntransmission occurred (i.e., on the job). For an occupational disease, the\nemployee must prove a substantial connection between the worker\u2019s occupation\nand the transmission of the disease. Employers will need to check how their\nstate handles occupational disease claims of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other\ncommunicable diseases to better understand what may happen with Covid-19.\nBecause Covid-19 may become widespread, determining specifically when & where\nit was contracted may be difficult. Expect compensable claims will be limited\nto those who have a substantial connection between their occupation and the\ntransmission of the disease (i.e., health care workers, possibly overseas\nflight attendants).\n\n### **National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) & Unionized Employers**\n\nThere will be issues unique to unionized employers, from negotiated attendance\ncontrol policies, contracting out bargaining unit work, supervisors performing\nbargaining unit work, prohibition on assignments outside job classification,\ncontractual restrictions on overtime, and restrictions on needed flexibility.\n\nIf the employer is not in a position to obtain cooperation from the union at\nthe time, it should look at what emergency provisions are in its collective\nbargaining agreement and any past arbitration decisions interpreting emergency\nsituations under its past contracts. Consider negotiating a memorandum of\nunderstanding or MOU with the union to cover possible pandemic needs to\nmaintain the business. If that does not work, anticipate allegations of\nunilateral changes and the defense of exigent circumstances. When claiming\nexigent circumstances, the burden of proof is on the employer.\n\nConsider whether to negotiate with the union about:\n\n  1. Temporary modification of absenteeism policies & procedures and\n  2. Temporary changes to workplace rules and contracting out in order to maintain business during pandemic situation\n\nEach employer\u2019s circumstances with their union is different; one size does not\nfit all. However, expect most arbitrators will be unlikely to uphold\ndischarges for excessive absenteeism when there is proof of pandemic illness\nin a particular workforce or community, despite an employee\u2019s past history.\n\n### **Occupational Health & Safety Act (OSHA)**\n\nOSHA requires employers provide safe & healthful working conditions. With this\nmandate in mind, OSHA has the authority to create standards employers must\nfollow and can issue advisory guidance, including for standards applicable to\nCovid-19 in the workplace. See\n<https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html>.\n\nFor employers whose employees are not at a high risk of exposure, OSHA has\nsimply referred employers to the CDC guidelines summarized above. However, for\nemployers involved in businesses deemed higher risk (health care, death care,\nlabs, airlines, international travel, border protection, solid waste, and\nwastewater management operations) or are working in a business with someone\nalready diagnosed with Covid-19, there is other guidance. These businesses\nshould visit OSHA\u2019s hazard recognition webpage for instructions on evaluating\nthe risk of exposure; implementing and ensuring workers use controls to\nprevent exposure; and taking various control measures that may include\nengineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and using\npersonal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n### **HIPAA Privacy Considerations for Employers During the Covid-19\nOutbreak**\n\nAt times like this, employers may wish to know if an employee who has left\nwork with a fever or cough and is not coming to work is out due to a suspected\nor diagnosed case of Covid-19 and whether they may notify co-workers who have\nbeen in close contact with that employee. To what extent does HIPAA cover this\ntype of information?\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to disclosures made by employees, volunteers,\nand other members of a covered entity\u2019s or business associate\u2019s workforce.\n\u201cCovered entities\u201d are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those\nhealth care providers that conduct one or more covered health care\ntransactions electronically, such as transmitting health care claims to a\nhealth plan. \u201cBusiness associates\u201d generally are persons or entities (other\nthan members of the workforce of a covered entity) who perform functions or\nactivities on behalf of, or provide certain services to, a covered entity that\ninvolve creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting protected health\ninformation or \u201cPHI.\u201d Employer health plans are covered by the HIPAA Privacy\nRule, but employers generally are not otherwise covered ( _unless their line\nof business qualifies them as either a covered entity or business associate_\n). However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits covered entities to disclose needed\nPHI, without the individual authorization, when the disclosure is made to\nfurther the following public health activities:\n\n  1. Disclosures made to a public health authority such as such as the CDC or a state or local health department, that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability;\n\n  2. Disclosures at the direction of a public health authority, to a foreign government agency that is acting in collaboration with the public health authority; and\n\n  3. Disclosures to notify a person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or may otherwise be at risk of contracting or spreading a disease or condition, if disclosure is authorized by law or otherwise permitted using minimum necessary standard.\n\nThe Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS), the agency responsible for oversight of HIPAA regulations and\nenforcement, has issued a bulletin regarding the ways covered entities can\nshare patient information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule in an outbreak of\ninfectious disease or other emergency situation. The OCR bulletin is available\n[here](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/february-2020-hipaa-and-novel-\ncoronavirus.pdf).\n\nIn short, the HIPAA Privacy Rule will have limited applicability in a Covid-19\nresponse planning of employers, but privacy concerns of employees are still\nimportant! The key is to ensure the employers\u2019 Covid-19 plans do not involve\nor rely on PHI obtained from the employers\u2019 health plan. For example, if an\nemployee with Covid-19 submits a request for leave along with the results of\nhis/her virus screening, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would NOT come into play. Why?\nBecause the information was voluntarily provided to the employer by the\nemployee for employment purposes entirely unrelated to the employer\u2019s health\nplan activities. This information was provided to the employer not to the\nhealth plan. Once in the possession of the employer, the HIPAA Privacy Rule\ndoes not _per se_ impose any obligation to maintain the employee\u2019s information\nconfidentially. However, regardless of good intentions, do not take this as a\nlicense to disclose this information to other employees. Why?\n\nSome will say, refer to the ADA as the reason not to disclose. But the ADA\nprohibits an employer from sharing medical information regarding an employee\u2019s\ndisability with the employee\u2019s co-workers. However, it does permits such\ndisclosure to supervisors, managers, and emergency personnel who need to know.\nA diagnosis of Covid-19 would not ordinarily, by itself, be considered a\ndisability under the ADA. That is still not a reason to make unfettered\ndisclosures. These disclosures would still likely be considered a breach of\nthe common law right of privacy or possibly support a defamation claim, and\nthese are recognized in many state jurisdictions. For this reason, it is\nbetter to avoid identifying an individual to one\u2019s co-workers. We recommend\ninstead that the HR manager train supervisors to maintain confidentiality and\nprovide guidance as to how to respond to employee questions. Consider whether\nit makes sense for the company to designate someone as the person responsible\nfor handling all Covid-19 employee information and inquiries, such as an HR\nmanager or safety manager. Provide appropriate advance written notice to the\nemployee, if it becomes necessary to disclose information about an employee\u2019s\nCovid-19 status to protect those in the workforce who came in close contact\nwith that employee, especially if the situation is going to require employees\nbeing placed under quarantine or self-monitoring at home. In fact, it may\nbecome essential to advise particular employees who were in close contact (\n_employees who worked within six feet of each other for prolonged periods_ )\nthat they should be tested for Covid-19). Check to see if your state has any\nparticular medical privacy rules for applicability as well and what public\nhealth orders have been issued.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhen written in Chinese, the word \u201ccrises\u201d is composed of two characters.

It\u2019s all very\nwell having the latest flash system in place to keep tabs on your workforce,\nbut if you as a business owner are unclear on what the resulting data means,\nor how you might best interpret it to bring benefit to your workers, then\nyou\u2019ll struggle to derive much advantage from it. When it comes to hot-button\ntopics such as absence intelligence, this is especially pertinent. Most\nbusinesses track when their employees are off unexpectedly. Some might flag\nparticularly noticeable trends to HR or make it part of a feedback session.\nBut very few understand how to access insight into day-to-day absence data\nwhich can help them provide better working experience for employees and also\nmaximize their own profitability.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nYour attendance tracker throws up that a particular employee has had four days\noff in one month. But do you have the full picture? What if you knew it was\nthe same day of the week every time? That might indicate a pattern; perhaps\nthe employee is juggling childcare on that day - you could sit down and work\nout a solution for both parties.\n\nWith proper absence reporting, you can quickly create a picture for an\nindividual employee, or even further by team, location, country or office.\nThese reports can give you clear visibility of employee absence across\ndifferent areas; interpreting that data is a different story. Here are the\nthree key ways which I\u2019d recommend every business owner and/or HR team puts\ninto practice, in order to gain stronger intelligence across the workforce:\n\n## **Put a number on it**\n\nTwo different employees may take the exact same amount of sick days across a 6\nmonth period, but this could be for completely different reasons, and the\npotential consequences for your business are markedly different too. Two weeks\noff after a medical operation, versus consistently missing every other Tuesday\n- you\u2019d be right in thinking that the long term disruption risk is very much\nfrom the second case. In this way, \u2018Bradford Factor\u2019 scoring is a useful way\nto act on absence data.\n\nThe Bradford Factor supports the principle that repeat absences have a greater\noperational impact than the long term sick. You can calculate an employee's\nBradford Factor using the Bradford Formula, which is: S x S x D = B. 'S' is\nthe total number of separate absences, 'D' is the total number of days'\nabsence and 'B' is the Bradford Factor score. The higher the number, the more\nattention you need to pay to an employee, even if their absences are in total\nnot extreme.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Measure Workplace\nProductivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\nmeasure-workplace-productivity/)**\n\n## **Look forward as well as backward**\n\nA trend businesses might not think about too deeply is this. Who\u2019s going to be\nin trouble six months\u2019 time?\u2019 By this, I mean that a worker who isn\u2019t taking\nany leave isn\u2019t a good thing. It means they\u2019re probably going to a) burn out\nand need a chunk of time off to recover, or b) stockpile their holiday to the\nend of the year and leave you with significant staffing issues.\n\nThis is where having strong absence intelligence, through understanding and\nanticipating your workers\u2019 needs down the line, can really help. If someone\nhasn\u2019t had a break for six months, it\u2019s worth raising it with them and\nrecommending some (well deserved) holiday. You can also create a holiday\nreport for your business that shows everyone who is on annual leave during a\ncertain month, allowing you to easily plan for future projects.\n\nThis also works around areas like returning to work; helping minimize the\namount of time that someone you see has had a significant amount of leave\nneeds to get back into the rhythm of your workplace is something you\ndefinitely don\u2019t want to leave too late.\n\n## **See where you can help workers help themselves**\n\nYou can point employees in the right direction to help them help themselves,\nand by extension the business, if your data can help identify who might be at\nparticular risk of frequent unexplained absence. In this case, doctors'\nappointments and sick days are a prime example. Someone who has had very\nlittle leave in a period of six months, only to take three lots of leave in a\ntwo month period, for example, could well have had something happen in their\nday to day life which is causing significant disruption.\n\n**Learn More:[Absence Isn\u2019t Hurting Your Business: Absence Management\nIs](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/absence-isnt-hurting-\nyour-business-absence-management-is-2/)**\n\nBy looking deeply into your absence data, you might see that some workers are\nrequiring frequent time off for medical reasons. The employee\u2019s needs come\nfirst, but you can help both parties by encouraging or making available the\nopportunity to work from home, take flexible hours or take phone appointments\nin the office. Additionally, you can actually preempt employees\u2019 requirements;\nproviding health-based resources via your company HR system to anyone who has\nan absence for their health so that they\u2019re better prepared for the future.\n\nTaking your absence intelligence seriously is a good opportunity to show\nemployees that you care and at the same time maximize their productivity for\nthe company.\n\n_Are you taking your absence intelligence seriously?

Follow the seven steps below\nfor an essential roadmap to planning the best retreat for your company.\n\n## **1\\. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nIt will be challenging to get buy-in from upper management without defining\nwhat constitutes a successful retreat. Bonus points if you can tie the results\ndirectly to revenue.\n\n  * **Morale Boost:** measure the turnover rate before and after the event, or even employee satisfaction with an anonymous survey.\n  * **Team Building:** breakdown barriers between departments, and have each explain their job in their own words to create inter-department bonds.\n  * **Marketing Materials:** take professional photos throughout the event to host on your social media pages or website for prospective employees to understand the [company culture.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/how-to-create-a-culture-of-growth-career-development-within-your-firm/)\n\n##  \n**2\\. Schedule the Event**\n\nConsider employee schedules. If your company is an accounting firm, April and\nmonths leading up to it would be a detrimental time to schedule the retreat.\nUse the event as an annual celebration to complement the employee work ethic\nafter the conclusion of a significant busy season.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Ways Employee Engagement Can Solve Productivity\nProblem](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/4-ways-\nemployee-engagement-can-solve-productivity-problem/)**\n\n## **3\\. Confirm Attendance**\n\nThe most successful retreats are the ones where there\u2019s buy-in from\nleadership. Confirm C-level executives will be in attendance to eliminate\nhierarchy during the event. Go one step further and have leaders come up with\nice breaker exercises or themed days throughout the retreat.\n\n## **4\\. Book the Location & Transportation**\n\nLocation, location, location. Think about the proximity of the office to the\nlocation of the event. If there will be any alcohol served, make sure\ntransportation is booked to and from the event. Some modes of transportation\nto consider include:\n\n  * **Taxis**\n  * **Busses**\n  * **Limos**\n  * **Airplanes**\n\n##  \n**5\\. Negotiate Pricing**\n\nBecause you\u2019re looking for such a large group, confirm any group discounts\nbefore charging the [company card](https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-\ncards/paypal-business-credit-card). Frequently, because you\u2019re bringing the\ntransportation company and the event space so much business, there are\ndiscounts to be had.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **6\\. Plan Events**\n\nDon\u2019t forget to plan the actual events during the retreat! These can be simple\nicebreakers or formal networking events. Think about your KPIs during this\nstage, as different activities will have more effects on the overall goal than\nothers.\n\n## **7\\. Revisit the Original KPIs**\n\nAfter the retreat is over and done with, revisit the goals set before going on\nthe resort. This is an excellent chance to elicit feedback. Understanding what\nwent well and didn\u2019t will be crucial to planning better and better retreats\nwith each passing year.\n\nWhen pitching this event to upper management, focus on the KPIs, especially\nanything that will affect the bottom line. Be an advocate for the employees\nwhile explaining the value that an event like this can have on overall morale.\n\n[![How to Plan a Company Retreat Without Losing Your Sanity](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-company-retreat)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=7 Ways to Create a Company Retreat with\nValue&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

What's worse, is there is an ever-present risk that\nsmall errors here can lead to big (and even more time-consuming) disputes and\nissues later down the track.\n\nThat's why specialised software can be such an important tool for HR\nprofessionals of all levels. Taking that difficult and risk-heavy task out of\nthe in-tray through an automated system gives HR leaders much greater\nopportunity to concentrate on building effective and productive cultures\nacross their workforce.

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\nAfter implementing tough border control measures, that include restricted\nentry for work pass holders, Singapore has also announced additional safe\ndistancing measures to reduce the risk of further local transmission of\nCOVID-19, especially for vulnerable segments of the population.\n\nAs such, [employers have been \"strongly advised\"](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-\nhighlights/details/stricter-safe-distancing-measures-to-prevent-further-\nspread-of-covid-19-cases) to put in place measures to reduce close physical\ninteractions amongst employees.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) has stated: \"All employers should facilitate\ntelecommuting for their employees to work from home. Tele-conferencing should\nalso be used in place of physical meetings wherever possible.\"\n\nFor employees undertaking job roles or functions where telecommuting (also\nknown as work from home arrangements) is not feasible, employers should take\nthe following precautions, as advised by MOH:\n\n  * **Staggered working hours:** Employers should implement staggered working hours (for both reporting and ending times) with minimally three one-hourly blocks and no more than 50% of total employees reporting to work within each one-hour block. Where possible, reporting and ending times should not coincide with peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport.\n  * **Reduce duration and proximity of physical interactions:** Employers should provide for physical spacing (of at least one metre apart) between work stations. If there is a need for physical meetings, the number of attendees should be limited and the duration shortened. Seats in meeting rooms should also be spaced at least a metre apart.\n  * **Defer non-critical events and scale down critical work events:** For critical work events that cannot be deferred, employers must limit these to no more than 250 participants at any point in time and put in place measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between participants. These include meals and mingling during the event.\n\n## Additional measures and requirements on safe distancing\n\n### **Events and gatherings**\n\n  * Between now and 30 June 2020, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants in attendance at any one time must be suspended.\n  * For events and gatherings with fewer than 250 participants, the following measures are necessary to ensure separation of at least a metre between participants: Spaced seating at events, and reducing mingling of participants such as during meal times.\n  * Events and gatherings must also comply with the existing guidance, including: \n    * Improving ventilation and advising participants to reduce contact with others;\n    * Temperature and health screening measures, and turning away persons who are unwell; and\n    * Measures to facilitate contact tracing if needed, such as obtaining contact details of participants.\n\n### Public venues\n\nOperators of public venues required to implement the necessary precautionary\nmeasures to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons. For\nexample:\n\n  * Queues (e.g. outside restaurants, at retail stores) should be kept fast-moving. This could be done by ensuring that all checkout counters are open, and encouraging self-checkout to minimise contact with counter staff.\n  * Operators are encouraged to demarcate queues to ensure patrons queue at least a metre apart from one another;\n  * F&B venues should maintain a distance of at least one metre between tables, and between seats. Where seats are fixed, including hawker centres, operators should ensure alternate seats are marked out; and\n  * Entertainment venues and attractions (e.g. cinemas/theatres, theme parks, casinos, museums and galleries) should adopt measures to ensure separation of at least a metre amongst patrons. This could include reducing operating capacity to provide more spacing, installing floor markers at queuing areas, and adopting chequerboard or alternate seating.\n\n### Measures for seniors\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals who are of older\nage or have underlying conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) have a higher\nrisk of severe COVID-19 infection. In view of this, the Multi-Ministry\nTaskforce has taken extra precautions to safeguard the wellbeing of seniors\"\n\n  * Since 11 March, all senior-centric activities at community clubs, residents\u2019 committees, Senior Activity Centres, Active Ageing Hubs, CREST Centres, Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres have been suspended for two weeks.\n  * National Silver Academy (NSA) courses and volunteer programmes administered by the Council for Third Age have also been suspended.\n  * These suspension will last till 7 April 2020.\n  * Organisers should put in place extra precautions in preparation for the resumption of organised activities after 7 April.\n\nAs affirmed by MOH on these latest measures: \"These safe distancing measures\nmust be stepped up urgently in tandem with our parallel efforts to tighten our\nborders, and to quarantine and ring-fence any infection clusters.\"\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

workers and give raises to current staff to deal\nwith coronavirus demands\n\nPublished Mon, Mar 16 20204:16 PM EDTUpdated Tue, Mar 17 202012:06 AM EDT\n\n[Annie Palmer](https://www.cnbc.com/annie-\npalmer/)[@annierpalmer](https://twitter.com/annierpalmer)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Amazon said Monday it plans to hire an additional 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers amid a surge in online orders due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n  * The company is also raising pay for warehouse and delivery workers by $2 per hour in the U.S through the end of April.\n  * On Saturday, Amazon said some brands in the \"household staples\" category were out of stock and warned that some of its \"delivery promises are longer than usual.\"\n\nAn Amazon warehouse\n\nGetty Images\n\n[Amazon](/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) is hiring an additional 100,000 employees in\nthe U.S. to meet the surge in demand from online shopping amid the coronavirus\noutbreak, the company [said](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-\nopening-100000-new-roles) Monday.\n\nThe company is looking to add extra full-time and part-time positions for\nwarehouse and delivery workers. Through the end of April, it will raise pay\nfor these employees by $2 per hour in the U.S., \u00a32 per hour in the UK, and\napproximately \u20ac2 per hour in many EU countries. Amazon currently pays $15 per\nhour or more in some areas of the U.S. for warehouse and delivery jobs.\n\nAmazon encouraged employees in other industries whose jobs were \"lost or\nfurloughed\" as a result of the coronavirus to apply, including members of the\nhospitality, restaurant and travel industries. \"We want those people to know\nwe welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past\nemployer is able to bring them back,\" the company added.\n\nThe decision comes as the coronavirus outbreak has continued to worsen. As of\nMonday afternoon, there were more than 181,000 confirmed cases of the\ncoronavirus globally, and at least 7,113 deaths. There were at least 4,281\nconfirmed cases of the virus in the U.S. and at least 74 deaths.\n\nAmazon [has been hit](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/coronavirus-amazon-says-\nitems-out-of-stock-deliveries-delayed.html) with a wave of delivery delays and\nproduct shortages. The continued spread of the coronavirus has meant consumers\nare increasingly relying on online retailers as they avoid going outdoors and\nface low inventory at physical stores.\n\nOn Saturday, Amazon [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/coronavirus-amazon-\nsays-items-out-of-stock-deliveries-delayed.html) some popular brands and items\nin the \"household staples\" categories were out of stock, while some of its\n\"delivery promises are longer than usual.\" Amazon added a notice to the top of\nits marketplace this weekend that reads: \"Inventory and delivery may be\ntemporarily unavailable due to increased demand. Confirm availability at\ncheckout.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a quick scan for in-demand items like toilet paper and bottled\nwater showed that many listings were out of stock. Amazon's normally speedy\none-day and two-day delivery options for Prime customers also showed delays of\nseveral days. After adding an item to the shopping basket, Amazon said the\norder would arrive within four days.\n\nAmazon has faced increased demand from customers on multiple fronts amid the\ncoronavirus outbreak. With shoppers stocking up online, services like Prime\nNow and the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service reported limited\navailability for several days or told shoppers they were unable to make\ndeliveries.\n\nThe company has been working to avoid disruptions in its supply chain, while\nsome factories in China and elsewhere remain offline. Third-party sellers have\nalso been working to [keep up with\ndemand](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/29/amazon-sellers-scramble-to-keep-\nproducts-in-stock-amid-coronavirus.html), with many saying their inventory is\nrunning low.\n\nAdditionally, some fulfillment center employees may not be showing up to work.\nEarlier this month, [Amazon relaxed its attendance policy for warehouse\nworkers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/amazon-tells-all-employees-to-stay-\nhome-amid-coronavirus-fears.html), allowing them to take unlimited unpaid time\noff through the month of March.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon moved to address the unique needs of fulfillment\ncenters and delivery by launching a [$25 million relief\nfund](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/coronavirus-amazon-launches-25-million-\nfund-for-drivers-seasonal-employees.html). The \"Amazon Relief Fund\" will allow\nthese employees to apply for grants that are equal to or up to two weeks of\npay if they're diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.\n\nThe company has also taken extra precautions at fulfillment centers,\nincreasing the frequency and intensity of cleaning at all of its sites and\nrequiring that employees sanitize and clean their work stations and vehicles\nat the start and end of every shift.\n\nLast week, Amazon [advised](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/amazon-tells-all-\nemployees-to-stay-home-amid-coronavirus-fears.html) global employees who are\nable to work from home to do so through the end of March. The directive\napplies to employees at Amazon's corporate offices.\n\nVIDEO2:4902:49\n\nAmazon working on delivering coronavirus test kits\n\n[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)\n\nRelated

This can leave\nthem pressed for time and sometimes without access to other HR professionals\nwith specific expertise and with whom they can discuss challenges or consider\nsolutions or approaches to the problems.\"\n\nBusiness owners, managers and employees require tools that offer support as\nthey build -- and sustain -- a resilient and successful business and team. In\nthat mindset, Payworks partnered with Arete HR to offer its clients HR\nAdvisory Services.\n\nAimed at those looking for practical human resources, legal and financial\nguidance and support from industry experts, the new product offers a wide\nrange of easily accessible resources. Clients can find information on common\nHR dilemmas, explore strategies for self-development, business essentials and\npeople management and access things like podcasts, checklists, infographics\nand links to legislation. Canadian businesses face a range of issues on any\ngiven day, and having easy access to guidance and knowledge helps leaders make\ndecisions with confidence.\n\nMyles Halliday, vice president of product management at Payworks, says the\ncompany recognized an opportunity to further serve its clients by connecting\nthem with timely support and guidance on how to best deal with HR issues.\n\nPartnering with Arete HR \"builds on and strengthens the services and support\"\nclients expect from Payworks, Halliday adds.\n\n\"Business owners or managers can often benefit from professional guidance in\nareas where they may not have the time, resources, expertise or professional\nbackgrounds to make a well-informed decision,\" he says. \"We also wanted to\nhelp our clients address other business challenges we know they face, whether\nby providing guidance around financial or legal questions or through referrals\nto real-time, short-term counselling services for employees facing personal\nchallenges.\"\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nHR Advisory Services' online library of carefully curated best-practice\ncontent can be accessed anytime, anywhere, in line with HR professionals' busy\nroles. Unlimited confidential, personalized support from Canadian subject-\nmatter experts is also accessible by phone, providing management teams with\nassistance options for unexpected HR events or clarification on legislation,\nfor example. Customizable management services offer clients the opportunity to\nchoose a mix of legal,  financial or specialized HR support, up to nine hours\nof additional guidance per year.\n\n\"HR professionals may also find HR Advisory Services particularly helpful in\nterms of access to legal and financial guidance, which may be outside their\nown areas of experience,\" adds McLean.\n\nEmployees experiencing personal issues or those affected by stress can be\nreferred by the employer for private counselling with a trained professional\nunder HR Advisory Services, with access to up to three hours of support per\nemployee per year. Not only does this help the employees who are experiencing\na hard time, but it helps the company as well by getting the workforce back on\ntrack with job performance and attendance.\n\n\"Our favourite feature of HR Advisory Services is the holistic design of the\nprogram,\" says Selena Benic, HR consultant at Payworks. \"The online resources\nare constantly evolving to meet leaders where they are, and the supports for\nemployees are both caring and solution-focused.\"\n\nWhile there may be other providers of similar products in the marketplace,\n\"most focus on offering generic templates to owners as a simple solution to\nchallenges that we know are often more complex than that,\" Benic adds.\n\nHR Advisory Service was designed to be a versatile, insightful solution that\ncan be customized to support each management team's unique needs.\n\n\"Effective, human-centered help for clients is just one click or phone call\naway,\" Benic says. \"As an organization that understands the complex and\ncompeting priorities of operating and running a business, we know just how\nimportant that truly is.\"\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "COVID-19 Outbreak: Why HRTech Is The Best Tool During These Times -

Learning can never go\nwaste and you can certainly use tools such as learning management system to\nstudy new courses, learn new domains and expand your array. With learning\nmanagement systems, you can ensure contactless knowledge and information\ndissemination with mobile-based learning. A lot of organizations can leverage\ncollaborative tools like forum discussions, wikis to improve communication and\ncollaboration within the teams. E-Learning with gamification can truly create\na rich, interactive and engaging learning experience.\n\nWe can see that the numbers are expected to rise with the dangers posed by the\nvirus outbreak. Due to this pandemic, millions of the workforce across the\nglobe are working from home and the HR function along with the businesses at\nlarge have found that HRtech is the best bet during these testing times to\nimprove the team collaboration, productivity and keep achieving the business\noutcomes.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190308060624-ENT-\nIndia-Logo-White.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntrepreneurInd\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/EntrepreneurIND\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurind/\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

including production, should still come to\nwork\n\nPublished Wed, Mar 18 202012:57 PM EDTUpdated Wed, Mar 18 20204:34 PM EDT\n\n[Lora Kolodny](https://www.cnbc.com/lora-\nkolodny/)[@lorakolodny](https://twitter.com/@lorakolodny)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * An e-mail sent to Tesla employees by the company's head of HR for North America, Valerie Workman, encouraged employees to work if they feel comfortable doing so on March 18. \n  * The email says Tesla received conflicting guidance from different levels of government amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and shelter-in-place orders in Fremont, California where its US car plant is based. \n\nPaul Jacob works on the general assembly of the Tesla Model 3 at the Tesla\nfactory in Fremont, California, on Thursday, July 26, 2018.\n\nMason Trinca | The Washington Post | Getty Images\n\nTesla's North America HR leader Valerie Workman sent an email to employees on\nWednesday morning encouraging them to come work, promising they would not be\n\"docked\" points in performance reviews if they chose to stay home, and\nexplaining why the Fremont factory and other facilities are up and running\namid a COVID-19 pandemic in and beyond California.\n\nThe email says [Tesla](/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) has received conflicting guidance\nfrom different levels of government amid the pandemic.\n\nTesla is [reportedly](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/tesla-fremont-still-\nopen-after-county-orders-basic-operations-report.html) running its Fremont,\nCalifornia car plant running Wednesday morning despite \"shelter in place\"\norders initiated across Alameda County (and other counties in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area) to curb the\n[COVID-19.coronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-live-\nupdates.html) outbreak.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alameda County [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/tesla-\nfremont-factory-not-essential-business-says-alameda-county.html) it does not\ndeem Tesla's Fremont plant an \"essential business\" and therefore expected\nTesla to run it with \"minimum basic operations\" only -- not cranking out new\ncars.\n\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly told CNBC on\nWednesday, \"Our directive was clear.\" He reiterated that Tesla's Fremont plant\nis not seen as an \"essential business\" under the health order in place in the\ncounty.\n\nTesla shares closed down 16% on Wednesday amid a major market sell-off.\n\nHere is the entire e-mail from Wednesday morning:\n\n_Hi Team!_\n\n _We still do not have a final word from the City, County, State and, Federal\nGovernment on the status of our operations. We have had conflicting guidance\nfrom different levels of government._\n\n _Until then, we are operating with Essential Employees only while all others\nare working from home, and working to incorporate all CDC guidelines into our\noperations._\n\n _There are no changes in your normal assignment and you should continue to\nreport to work if you are in an essential function: production, service,\ndeliveries, testing and supporting groups as discussed with your manager. If\nyou are not assigned to support an essential function, your manager might\nsuggest a temporary relocation to support essential functions, or you may need\nto be on call._\n\n _If you are not feeling well, please stay at home and use PTO. If your PTO\nbalance is low, you can borrow up to 80 hours (2 weeks), after you exhaust\nyour PTO balance. Please inform your manager and follow the normal procedures\nfor sick time._\n\n _If you cannot or are reluctant to come to work, you can also use your PTO.\nPlease inform your manager.

Our university's mission of\neducation, research, and patient care is more important than ever, and that\nmission is fulfilled by all of you.\n\n[![Coronavirus\nillustration](https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_thumbnail/public/covid_thumbnail.jpg?itok=mLkTHmgL)](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-\ncoronavirus-information/)\n\nWhat you need to know\n\n##### [COVID-19 information center](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-coronavirus-\ninformation/)\n\nResources and updates for the Johns Hopkins community, including travel\nguidance, information on university operations, and tips for preventing the\nspread of illness\n\nToday we are taking additional steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and\nto ensure your health and safety, following close consultation with Johns\nHopkins experts in public health, infectious disease, and emergency\nmanagement.\n\n#### Work from home\n\nWhile the university remains open, we encourage managers to develop and\nimplement telework plans for eligible employees, so that the university can\nmaintain operations while taking every precaution to reduce the spread of\ninfection.\n\n  * Eligible employees should work from home when possible, provided it does not interfere with continued vital university operations and is consistent with our [Workplace Flexibility guidelines](https://hr.jhu.edu/working-here/workplace-flexibility/).\n  * Eligible employees are those whose university duties can be completely or substantially performed at a distance or from home, as determined by their manager.\n\nThese measures are not just intended to protect the health of teleworking\nemployees. Reducing the number of employees in the workplace is also a\ncritical step to protect the health of our colleagues whose jobs cannot be\nperformed from home.\n\n#### Faculty and staff who cannot work from home (including employees\ncurrently designated for required attendance)\n\nWhile we encourage telework for eligible employees, there is some work at\nJohns Hopkins that simply cannot be done from home. For those employees whose\nduties cannot be completed at home, managers will adopt practices to minimize\nthe spread of infection and protect the well-being of our community, including\nthe following:\n\n  * Establish flexible work schedules for staff where possible to reduce the number of people working near one another at the same time\n  * Implement social distancing practices meant to reduce close contact in the workplace (e.g., maintain a distance of 6 feet from others)\n  * Consider transitioning all meetings to phone or virtual formats\n\n#### If you get sick, stay home\n\nYour health and the health of our community is our primary concern. Please\nfollow the university sick policy, and notify your manager if you are sick.\n\n  * If you are concerned that you may have contracted COVID-19, call your healthcare provider and they will help you to determine whether self-isolation or self-quarantine is needed.\n  * If you do not have a healthcare provider or cannot obtain an appointment promptly, contact Occupational Health by phone (410-955-6211 before 7:30 a.m. or after 4 p.m., or 410-955-5000 after hours; ask for the Occupational Health Nurse on call).\n  * Occupational Health will conduct a screening by phone and provide guidance on whether self-isolation or self-quarantine (or a visit to a medical provider) is needed and help determine if others may have been exposed in the workplace.\n\n#### Self-quarantine\n\nIf you are told to self-quarantine, even if you are not symptomatic, stay\nhome.\n\nIf your healthcare provider instructs you to self-quarantine, notify your\nmanager and Occupational Health by phone (410-955-6211 before 7:30 a.m. or\nafter 4 p.m., or 410-955-5000 after hours; ask for the Occupational Health\nNurse on call). Occupational Health will help determine if others may have\nbeen exposed in the workplace.\n\n#### Sick leave\n\nWith regard to sick leave, we will ensure that all employees are able to stay\nat home during the required 14-day period of self-isolation or quarantine.\n\n  * If you have been directed by Occupational Health, a healthcare provider, or a state/local public health official to self-isolate or self-quarantine--due to your COVID-19 diagnosis, your symptoms, or your exposure to a known COVID-19 case--you should stay home. You will be provided leave for the mandated self-isolation/self-quarantine period up to 14 calendar days. This means that you will be given up to 10 business days of COVID-19 leave and the time will not be charged to you.\n  * If you are not symptomatic during the period of self-isolation or self-quarantine and telework is feasible, you may coordinate with your supervisor to telework during that period.\n\nPlease reach out to your supervisor, HR Business Partner, or local HR team for\nguidance about additional issues or concerns that may emerge. Faculty should\ncontact their department chair/vice dean for faculty with any questions.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and flexibility. Please continue to watch for\nadditional communications and updates, and to check the [Hub's COVID-19\ninformation page](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-coronavirus-information/) for\nJohns Hopkins community updates.\n\nFinally, we are profoundly grateful to each of you for your support and ask\nthat you take care of yourself and your fellow members of the Johns

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nWorkers are people too, and as HR professionals, it's essential to understand\nthat employees have lives outside of the business. A flexible schedule and\ntime off are great options for any team member who needs to spend more time\nwith their loved ones, but when employee absences become excessive, that can\ntake a massive toll on the company\u2019s productivity and team morale.\n\nSimply chastising employees who miss work regularly might have been an\napproach that worked in the past, but the 21st century requires a more\ncreative and understanding approach when dealing with this issue. To help, 12\nmembers of[ Forbes Human Resources Council](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/)\nshare their insight into how an HR team can combat the problem of employee\nabsenteeism and why these methods are likely to work.\n\nMembers offer advice for HR pros looking to combat excessive employee\nabsences.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Develop An Absence Management Policy  **\n\nBusinesses should develop a policy that defines what excessive absences mean\nfor their operations. The number of absences allowed should be stated, as well\nas the number of absences that will not be tolerated. The policy should also\ncontain clear disciplinary actions or penalties for employees who violate this\npolicy. This should be applied consistently and objectively to deter future\noccurrences. - [Ochuko\nDasimaka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ochukodasimaka/),[ Career Heights\nConsulting, Inc.](http://www.careerheights.org/)\n\n**2\\. Implement Flexible Work Policies  **\n\nA flexible work policy not only impacts things like employee well-being,\nretention and attracting talent positively, but it can also impact employee\nattendance positively. With a flexible work schedule, if an employee is\nrunning late or has an appointment in the morning, the employee can arrive\nfeeling confident that their arrival time will bear no adverse impact to their\nwork day. - [Angela Persaud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-\npersaud-a0018b6/),[ G/O Media](http://g-omedia.com/)\n\n**3\\. Build A Solid Team Culture  **\n\nWhen people have a team mentality, they don't have excessive absences because\nthey know how it will negatively impact the team. Additionally, when there is\na team culture and someone actually needs the excessive absences for good\nreason, the team is more willing to pick up the slack and it does not\ninterrupt business operations. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Give Employees An Inspirational Purpose  **\n\nIt starts with the basics of communicating expectations and documenting an\nabsence policy. People work for a paycheck, but nobody lives for money. If we\nwant to boost attendance, we need to inspire them with a clear organizational\npurpose. By establishing and communicating that purpose, team members will be\nmore inspired to show up and deliver incredible work on a regular basis. -[\nSteve Lowisz](https://twitter.com/slowisz),[ Qualigence International/Lowisz\nConsulting](http://www.qualigence.com/)\n\n**5\\. Focus On Employee Engagement  **\n\nEngaged employees statistically miss work less. While some use limited paid\nsick-leave or offer incentives for perfect attendance, these can also\nadversely influence ill employees to come to work, endangering others.\nBoosting employee engagement deepens employees' emotional connection to their\nwork and co-workers, strengthening their internal motivation to be\nmeaningfully present at work. -[ Courtney Pace,\nPh.D.](https://twitter.com/RevDrMom_Pace),[ FedEx Employees Credit\nAssoc.](http://www.fecca.com/)\n\n**6\\. Institute Work-From-Home Policies**\n\nCreate a generous work-from-home policy -- oftentimes, employers take sick\ndays for reasons other than being sick. Sometimes they are caring for a loved\none, taking family members to the doctor, or other personal reasons such as a\nchild's performance, waiting for the cable guy, etc. If your employees know\nthey can work from home instead of calling in sick, you'll get happier and\nmore productive employees! -[ Yolanda Lau](https://twitter.com/yolandafan),[\nFlexTeam](https://www.flexteam.com/)\n\n**7\\. Provide Ample PTO  **\n\nGood employers understand that employees have lives outside of work. While\nwork is important, so are family, free time, hobbies, etc., and for most, one\nto two weeks of paid time off (PTO) a year doesn't allow enough time to handle\nlife's responsibilities while still providing some much-needed time off.\nEmployers that provide ample PTO will see it reflected in increased employee\nengagement and reduced absences. -[ John\nFeldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**8\\. Take A Human-Centered Approach  **\n\nThere is usually a deeper issue contributing to excess time off. Take a human-\ncentered approach to treat these employees as individuals. Show care and\nconcern for the extenuating circumstances that may be affecting attendance.\nProvide company-sponsored resources (i.e. an EAP program) where appropriate.\nTreating employees this way reinforces the relationship the company has with\nits workforce. - [Jessica\nDelorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicadelorenzo/),[ Kimball\nElectronics Inc](http://www.kimballelectronics.com/)\n\n**9\\. Create Voice-Of-Employee Programs  **\n\nIntentionally implementing voice-of-employee strategies is one of the best\nways to engage with your workforce and give them the opportunity to have their\nvoice heard. Weekly \"Do Drop In\" sessions, ERGs and other voice levers help\nyou understand what your organization's employee experience really is and\nhelps your employees feel that their voice matters. -[ Cat\nGraham](https://twitter.com/hrcatgraham),[ Cheer\nPartners](http://www.cheerpartners.com/)\n\n**10\\. Focus On Outcomes, Not Managing Time  **\n\nUtilize a complete absence management outsourcing solution. Categorize\nabsences, and identify which are \"unacceptable.\" Keep in mind that we work\nwith human beings. Seek input around what should and shouldn't be a \"permitted\nabsence.\" Offer more flex time if you want consistent presence at certain\nmeetings. Hire people who don't like to be told what to do and have a history\nof being A-players. -[ Zain Hasan](https://twitter.com/zainshasan),[ Risk\nStrategies Company](http://www.risk-strategies.com/)\n\n**11\\. Check In With Team Members Regularly  **\n\nExcessive absences that are not related to health can indicate low job\nsatisfaction or an imbalance in an employee's home and work lives. Either way,\nbusiness owners can avoid excessive absences by setting up regular check-ins\nto gauge employee satisfaction and stress levels, as well as by providing\nflexible work-from-home policies to accommodate for family issues when needed.\n- [Laura Spawn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraspawn/),[ Virtual Vocations,\nInc.](https://www.virtualvocations.com/)\n\n**12\\. Stick To The Agreements  **\n\nCulture lives in the way things get done (e.g. hiring people, managing\nperformance, rewarding people, etc.). Success as a team is a commitment to the\nright disciplines. Understand what is preventing them from being to work on\ntime. Remind them of the agreements set in their offer letter and stick to\nthose agreements they made. What has changed? Ask questions. Empathize and\nfocus on the agreements. -[ Nicole Smartt\nSerres](https://twitter.com/Nicole_Smartt),[ Star\nStaffing](http://www.starhr.com/)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Wellness Coach, the\nSoftbank-funded enterprise wellness startup offering mental and physical\nwellness tools to 200+ companies globally, today announced the findings of its\nQ1 2020 \u201cEmployee Wellness Index\u201d (EWI) and data related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 virus on employee wellness.\n\n> After a successful completion of its initial $3 million capital investment\n> led by SoftBank Capital NY and the launch of its live mediation, sleep music\n> and fitness classes last year, the company has witnessed rapid growth of\n> over 200 enterprise clients in less than a year. Since the Covid-19\n> pandemic, the company is adding 10+ companies a day to their platform and\n> has been offering companies a free, 90-day trial for new enterprise\n> customers in hopes of easing stress in the nation.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nWellness Coach analyzed a sample 100+ companies and thousands of anonymous\nemployee wellness class usage data to show overall trends. For vertical\nresults, the company looked at 10+ companies in the vertical to draw vertical\nconclusions.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n  * After seeing a normal drop-off in emotional intelligence, focus, stress and relaxation class attendance over the November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 timeframe as employees spent more time with family over the holidays, the company saw an 86% increase in fitness class attendance due to New Year\u2019s resolutions \n  * As the COVID-19 pandemic became more pronounced in March, class attendance related to stress increased 52% month-over-month, with emotional intelligence classes dropping by 32% and relaxation classes increasing by 17% month-over-month \n  * As it relates to the heavily hit Advertising and Travel sectors, \n    * Fitness classes increased by 250% (yoga, fitness and home fitness) month-over-month \n    * Relaxation Increased by 70% (working from home, listing to music while working) \n    * Stress-related classes increased 60% (more breathing exercises, anxiety exercise) \n    * Emotional intelligence classes dropped by 48%, \n    * Sleep (bedtime stories, sleep meditations and music) dropped by 25%, \n\n\u201cThe Employee Wellness Index gives companies a real-time look at the needs of\ntheir employees, based on the classes employees are attending,\u201d said D.\nSharma, Co-Founder and CEO of Wellness Coach. \u201cThe impact on COVID-19 related,\nemployee stress is significant. We are seeing a shift from more work-related\nclasses (emotional intelligence) to stress management tools. Work from home\nand the harder-hit travel and advertising sector saw a much higher increase in\nstress, as they are coping with taking care of their body and mind by working\nout, relaxing and using tools to alleviate stress.\u201d\n\n**Background**\n\nFor decades, employers have relied on archaic surveys to understand employee\nengagement and morale.

With the virus outbreak now\nreaching over 189 countries and affecting more than 730 000 people, the\nconcern around employee safety and health has gained paramount importance.\n\nOrganisations are already suspending finger/thumb-based biometric attendance.\nMost organisations are also moving away from swipe card-based attendance as\nit's equally unsafe. (We may at least wash our hands but never sanitise swipe\ncards as they are kept at all surfaces.)\n\nThe innocent-looking door handle/knobs seem to be the biggest source of\ninfection spread. Most organisations are looking for an effective **pandemic\ncontrol system** that can identify/isolate only the infected employee to drive\nemployee wellness and resume normalcy.\n\nOur partner, Ramco Systems, recently unveiled an advanced facial recognition-\nbased attendance system \u2013 RamcoGEEK, embedded with temperature recording that\ncan integrate with IOT sensor doors to enable organisations to move towards\n\u2018touch-less\u2019 attendance and workplace access, in the wake of the COVID-19\noutbreak.\n\nCombined with a thermal imaging device for temperature measurement, it enables\norganisations to track staff or visitors with high temperatures that may\nindicate infection and build in operating procedures to avoid further spread\nof infection within enclosed spaces,creating a healthy workplace.\n\n **RamcoGEEK for Attendance with Temperature Capturing can:**\n\n  * Detect and match the faces of staff members and mark their attendance along with temperature.\n  * System is linked to an IOT sensor-powered door which can restrict access in case the temperature is higher than normal and auto apply for leave on behalf of the employee.\n  * Communicate the information to HR and management in real-time.\n  * Track the movements of a high-temperature employee/person on the premises.\n  * Send notifications/alerts to all those employees, customers, vendors and others who interacted with in-person, in the event any person develops COVID-19 symptoms or is diagnosed.\n\nIn addition, you can implement a contact tracing chatbot which enables the\norganisation to trace the contacts around an infected employee or reverse\ntrace based on publicly available information to contain further spread.\n\nKeen to explore?

would have been unthinkable just months ago, quarantine and\nsocial distancing have now become commonplace globally as governments make\nconcerted efforts to fight the spiraling coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe measures, which have seen citizens from the U.S. to India either\nencouraged or enforced to stay in their homes, are deemed by medical experts\nas necessary in reducing the spread of the virus. But, the implications for\npeople's mental wellbeing cannot be overlooked.\n\nA recent [study from medical journal The\nLancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(20\\)30460-8/fulltext)\nnotes that the psychological impact of quarantine can be great, resulting in a\nrange of mental health concerns from anxiety and anger to sleep disturbances,\ndepression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, separate studies\nof quarantined patients of SARS, a previous coronavirus outbreak in 2003,\nfound [between 10%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780353/) and\n[29%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323345/) suffered PTSD.\n\nThe Lancet's report found mental health concerns could be inflamed by\nstressors associated with quarantine, such as infection fears, frustration,\nboredom, inadequate supplies, lack of information, financial loss and stigma\nassociated with contracting the disease.\n\nThat can be an issue not only for people with preexisting mental health\nconcerns, but also those in seemingly good psychological health.\n\n **Identifying mental health concerns:**\n\nThe [CDC notes](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-\nstress-anxiety.html) that people should look out for signs of distressed\nmental health in themselves and others. Symptoms may include:  \n\u2014 Fear and worry about your own health  \n\u2014 Changes in sleep or eating patterns  \n\u2014 Difficulty sleeping or concentrating  \n\u2014 Worsening of chronic health problems  \n\u2014 Increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs\n\nRecognizing the problem, the World Health Organization this week released\nguidance on how people can protect their [mental health during the\noutbreak.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059542)\n\n\"Humans are social animals,\" professor Ian Hickie at the University of\nSydney's Brain and Mind Centre told [CNBC Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/make-\nit/). \"Prolonged quarantine or social isolation (without compensatory methods\nin place) will exacerbate anxiety, depression and a sense of helplessness.\"\n\n## What governments can do\n\nThe good news is some governments have stepped up to address those mental\nhealth stressors. The report notes that should be done by communicating\nquarantine measures effectively, with an emphasis on its altruistic\njustification, while minimizing the duration and ensuring sufficient supplies.\n\n\"By addressing some of these stressors, governments can help mitigate the\nimpact that quarantine can have on mental health,\" Dr. Marcus Tan, consultant\npsychiatrist at Singapore-based Nobel Psychological Wellness Clinic told CNBC\nMake It.\n\nHowever, medical experts, including Michael Friedman, associate professor at\nColumbia School of Social Work in New York, have called on officials to do\nmore by [creating sub-groups to assist with behavioral\nhealth](https://socialwork.columbia.edu/news/addressing-the-psychological-\nfallout-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/).\n\nValentinrussanov\n\n\"For people without adequate resources, so-called 'disruptions' are\ncatastrophes. The impact on their mental health will be awful,\" Friedman told\nCNBC Make It, highlighting extended tele-medical services as one source of\nrelief for those with existing mental or substance use disorders.\n\nAlready in the U.S., [new funding\nrules](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/03/congress-funding-\ncoronavirus) are being introduced to make these services reimbursable. But\nJayashri Kulkarni, psychiatry professor at Monash University in Melbourne,\nsaid such mental health services should be made more publicly available.\n\n\"There is a prevailing belief that in any crisis you deal with the physical\nissues first, then the mental health issues much later. I challenge this view\nbecause we need the public to be robust mentally to deal with the challenges\nahead,\" she told CNBC Make It.\n\n## What employers can do\n\nAs well as governments, employers also have a role to play in safeguarding\ntheir employees' health and providing reassurances at this time, Ronni Zehavi,\nCEO of HR platform Hibob, told CNBC Make It.\n\n\"Transparency is key throughout times of distress, so workplaces and HR teams\nspecifically should practice clear communication and disseminate updates\nregarding the virus and current protocols,\" said Zehavi.\n\nHe added that companies should inform their staff of time and attendance\nmeasures so they're \"fully aware of expectations\" and aren't clocking in and\nout unnecessarily at home.\n\n## What individuals can do\n\nHowever, as more and more people face the prospects of several weeks of\nquarantine or social distancing, individuals will also have to establish their\nown ways of preserving their mental health at home.\n\nCNBC Make It compiled the advice of psychology experts, as well as several\nhealth bodies, to find out their top tips:\n\n  *  **Create a routine** \u2014 Change out of your pajamas, shower and make a to-do of all the things you want to achieve each day to create a sense of normality and productivity.\n  *  **Break up your day** \u2014 Find tasks to break up your day and, where possible, change your environment for different activities.\n  *  **Take care of your body** \u2014 Eat healthily, get plenty of sleep and exercise daily. That could include conducting indoor workout classes, stretching and practicing meditation. \n  * **Help others** \u2014 If you're not under strict isolation rules yourself, and you're in a position to do so, find ways to support those in need by offering to run errands and collect supplies for them.\n  *  **Stay connected** \u2014 Make the most of technology and stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family via phone calls, texts, social media and video conferencing.\n  *  **Limit media intake** \u2014 Stay informed about the situation via reliable sources, but limit your news and social media intake to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n  *  **Prepare medical supplies** \u2014 The [National Alliance on Mental Illness](https://www.nami.org/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-Coronavirus) advises, where necessary, asking your doctor for extended prescription supplies to tide you over for quarantine periods.\n  *  **Fight boredom** \u2014 Make the most of catching up TV series, reading and exploring projects you have been putting off to beat boredom and stay mentally active.\n  *  **Avoid burnout** \u2014 Set strict limits to your work to avoid becoming overwhelmed and make time to unwind.\n  *  **Focus on the positives** \u2014 Amplify good news stories and honor caregivers working tirelessly to resolve the situation.\n  *  **Take one day at a time** \u2014 Try not to project too far into the future. Remember that these are temporary measures and you are not alone.\n\n\"My advice? Always the same,\" said Friedman.\n\n\"Stay in contact with people \u2014 virtually \u2014 engage in activities that give you\npleasure and a sense of meaning, and do what you can to help others, which is\na remarkable antidote to depression.\"\n\n _ **Don 't miss: **_[_**How to keep your money safe as markets panic

quickly,\" he says.\n\nGroves, who previously spent seven years working with small businesses by\nproviding face-to-face coaching, says it is \"hugely frustrating\" for SMEs, who\ndon't have the time, resources or budget to access this powerful learning\nmedium.\n\nThe e-learning industry is \"stuck in its ways\", he says, resulting in SMEs\npaying up to 10 times more for content than their corporate counterparts.\n\n\"Our mission therefore is to simplify and democratise the space, and address\nthe UK-wide skills gap from the bottom up.\n\n\"The fast growth of the e-learning sector means that face-to-face training is\ntaking a hit.\"\n\nHe says most e-learning companies are focused on promoting the benefits of\ne-learning over face-to-face learning, but Training Sensei has decided to move\nin the opposite direction, actively working with professional coaches.\n\n\"We've built many strong relationships with professional trainers and coaches,\nand now in the fortunate position to help them earn an income despite the\nimpact coronavirus is having on their business.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to work with this community and have been\nhumbled by the response.\"\n\nGroves, who said he has always had an entrepreneurial spirit, previously\nstarted a ground maintenance business, an online educational game and a CRM\nsystem - all whilst in full-time employment.\n\n\"None of these really took off but they were all profitable and gave me the\nconfidence to think that if I did dedicate myself to a business full-time,\nthat I would be able to make a success of it,\" he says.\n\nGroves' says part of the success of the business is down to his attendance at\nover 200 business events. \"It almost become a joke.\n\n\"I was planning on cutting down but I'm really starting to miss them now!\"\n\nShare Article\n\n[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=1%2C000%25+growth+planned+for+%27democratising%27+e-learning+programme&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesscloud.co.uk%2Fnews%2F1000-growth-\nplanned-for-democratising-elearning-programme&via=BClouduk \"Share this post on\nTwitter\")[__](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=941656822618210&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesscloud.co.uk%2Fnews%2F1000-growth-\nplanned-for-democratising-elearning-programme \"Share this post on\nFacebook\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesscloud.co.uk%2Fnews%2F1000-growth-\nplanned-for-democratising-elearning-\nprogramme&title=1%2C000%25+growth+planned+for+%27democratising%27+e-learning+programme&summary=Manchester+start-\nup+Training+Sensei+hopes+to+reduce+cost+of+remote+employee+education+and+close+skills+gap\n\"Share this post on LinkedIn\")\n\n[<< Back to news](/news)\n\n#### Related News\n\n[ News\n\n### Clicky channels TV advertising with Sky AdSmart\n\n11th, Aug The digital agency has become the region\u2019s first to offer\u2026\n](/news/clicky-channels-tv-advertising-with-sky-adsmart)\n\n[ News\n\n### Transformation director appointed at Well\n\n23rd, Mar Chris Ellett joins the UK\u2019s largest independent pharmacy chain\nafter\u2026 ](/news/transformation-director-appointed-at-well)\n\n[ News\n\n### Deliveroo vs Uber: Is a food fight about to kick off?\n\n10th, Mar Owner of Yogberries, Matthew Agass, expects UberEATS to follow\nDeliveroo\u2026 ](/news/deliveroo-vs-uber-is-the-real-food-fight-about-to-begin)\n\n#### Upcoming Events\n\n#### News Tags\n\n[coronavirus](/tags/bc-coronavirus)[MarTech](/tags/bc-\nmartech)[obituaries](/tags/bc-obituaries)[hacking](/tags/bc-hacking)[51 Health\nTech Pioneers](/tags/bc-51-health-tech-pioneers)[cryptocurrency](/tags/bc-\ncryptocurrency)[RegTech](/tags/bc-regtech)[music](/tags/bc-\nmusic)[London](/tags/bc-london)[infrastructure](/tags/bc-infrastructure)\n\n#### Opinion\n\n[\n\n### Meet SMEs leading charge in coronavirus crisis\n\nMarcus Gibson, editor of the Gibson Index, highlights the exceptional\u2026\n06-04-2020 ](/opinion/meet-smes-leading-charge-in-coronavirus-crisis)\n\n[\n\n### Get your small business out of a visual rut\n\nTop tips for finding inspiration with visual imagery from Jacqueline\u2026\n03-04-2020 ](/opinion/get-your-small-business-out-of-a-visual-rut)\n\n[\n\n### Social media's crucial role in COVID-19 lockdown\n\nHealthy engagement can go a long way to reducing social\u2026 01-04-2020\n](/opinion/social-medias-crucial-role-in-covid-19-lockdown)\n\n#### Read digital edition\n\n[![](/images/structure/img/emagazine.png)](/magazine)\n\n#### Podcasts\n\n[\n\n### How does Open Banking work?\n\nIn this week's show host Alistair Hardaker is joined by\u2026 06-03-2020\n](/podcasts/how-does-open-banking-work)\n\n[\n\n### Is your sports team in breach of GDPR?\n\nCould your local sports team in breach of GDPR?

Find the collection\n[here](https://www.theatlantic.com/category/what-you-need-know-coronavirus/).\n\nLoress Burke, a worker at an Amazon warehouse in New York, was coughing\nthroughout our interview when we spoke recently. She tried to get tested for\nCOVID-19, but her doctors instead told her to stay home for two weeks. In line\nwith Amazon\u2019s [new policy](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-\namazon/covid-19-update-more-ways-amazon-is-supporting-employees-and-\ncontractors?tag=theverge02-20), the company said it would pay her for the\nlength of her quarantine. But there is a catch: She was told she won\u2019t be paid\nuntil after she returns to work. That\u2019s a problem, she said, because she cares\nfor her disabled sister and needs the money now. \u201cI got the idea that they\nweren\u2019t sure how this is working, because this is as new to them as it is to\nus,\u201d Burke told me.\n\nBurke\u2019s ordeal highlights the struggle some workers are facing in getting paid\nfor their sick days, even as their companies roll out new policies offering\npaid leave because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many employees are no doubt\nfortunate to be working at companies whose services are still in demand.\nNevertheless, large companies such as Walmart and Amazon have struggled to\nadapt and explain their sick-leave policies amid a fast-moving pandemic.\n\nWhere retail workers once might have received a set number of hours off, the\ncrisis has raised complicated new questions about employee absences. What\nshould happen to workers who are immunocompromised, for example? Or to those\nwho feel sick but aren\u2019t able to get a coronavirus test? Unlike white-collar\nworkers, many of whom enjoy liberal sick-leave policies, blue-collar workers\ncan\u2019t always be confident they\u2019ll be paid for their time away. While an\nasthmatic office worker can easily work from home, many retail and delivery\nworkers with underlying health conditions make agonizing calculations about\nwhether to risk their health or their income.\n\n[Read: Exclusive: Amazon confirms first known coronavirus case in an American\nwarehouse](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/amazon-\nwarehouse-employee-has-coronavirus/608341/)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t appear to be an issue of intentional malpractice by companies,\nbut rather a failure to catch up with the severity and frequency of COVID-19\ncases, and to reconcile company policies with fast-changing state and federal\nguidance that affect the lives of workers and their families.\n\nStill, even unintentional delays hit workers hard. Interviews with Amazon,\nWalmart, and Whole Foods employees painted a picture of confusion about the\nnew policies and who is eligible. ( _The Atlantic_ reached out to these\ncompanies for comment and has yet to hear back on most of our queries.)\n\nWorkers might, for example, fall ill before a new policy goes into effect. Or\nthey might embark on a lengthy process of attempting to prove they\u2019re really\nsick and wait for weeks to get paid\u2014longer than many of them can afford to go\nwithout money.\n\nWalking out of O\u2019Hare Airport on March 18 after a trip to Spain, Christian\nZamarron, an Amazon warehouse employee in Chicago, was stopped by an official\nwho told him that because he had recently visited a country with a large\ncoronavirus outbreak, he should stay home from work for 14 days. Zamarron said\nhe thought it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, because Amazon had [recently\ngranted](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/amazon-warehouse-\nemployee-has-coronavirus/608341/) two weeks of paid sick leave to workers who\ntest positive for COVID-19, or who are placed into quarantine. But several\nAmazon employees, including Zamarron, told me the process to get paid for\ntheir time in quarantine has been byzantine and, in certain cases,\nunsuccessful entirely.\n\nAs soon as he realized he\u2019d be missing work, Zamarron said, he called Amazon\u2019s\nemployee resource center, the company\u2019s HR equivalent, to make sure he\u2019d get\npaid. After an hour on the phone, he finally got through to someone and\nexplained his predicament. The person told him he was eligible for an unpaid\nleave of absence.\n\nHe asked whether he could receive paid leave instead, according to Amazon\u2019s\npolicy, and was told a case manager would reach out to him within a few days.\nBut he didn\u2019t hear from anyone for more than a week, and he wasn\u2019t paid. When\na case manager finally got in touch, it was to provide him with unpaid leave-\nof-absence forms. Zamarron, who had traveled to Spain with another Amazon co-\nworker, grappled with what to do. \u201cEither we take the hit, and we don\u2019t get a\ncheck for two weeks,\u201d he told me, \u201cor we go to work and infect our co-\nworkers.\u201d\n\nHours after I emailed Amazon about his case, Zamarron got a call from a human\nresources representative who said Zamarron and his co-worker would be\nretroactively paid for their time away from work. (Amazon denied that my email\nprompted the payment.)\n\nAnother Amazon employee, who leads an informal workers\u2019 union, told me he does\nknow of cases in which the paid-leave policy was implemented correctly. But\nthose workers either tested positive for COVID-19, or Amazon itself ordered\nthem quarantined.\n\nAmazon workers who can\u2019t prove they have COVID-19, meanwhile, find themselves\nin a more difficult situation. Nicole Jackson, who works at the Chicago\nfacility with Zamarron, hasn\u2019t been back to her job since March 9, when she\ncame down with a fever and a cough, and began to experience shortness of\nbreath\u2014telltale symptoms of the coronavirus. She told me her doctor wouldn\u2019t\ntest her for COVID-19, because the tests are in short supply. But he did tell\nJackson to stay home, so she emailed Amazon\u2019s employee resource center to try\nto get quarantine pay. She was unsuccessful and missed weeks of pay. The day\nafter I emailed Amazon, she heard from a caseworker who began to work on\nprocessing her paycheck again.\n\nLike many other companies, Amazon is allowing warehouse workers to take\n[unlimited unpaid](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/amazon-\nwarehouse-employee-has-coronavirus/608341/) time off through the end of March.\nBut workers say they can\u2019t afford to go without their paychecks, even as they\nfear returning to work. Tonya Fondren, who is also employed in Amazon\u2019s\nChicago warehouse, has been absent from work for two weeks because she has\nlupus. She\u2019s afraid to return to work, because her weakened immune system\nmakes her more susceptible to the coronavirus. But Fondren told me she will\nsoon be returning anyway, simply because she\u2019s out of money. Though Chicago\nhas a local [paid sick-leave](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/cook-\ncounty-illinois-enacts-paid-sick-leave-ordinance) ordinance, she says Amazon\u2019s\nsystem shows she has accumulated only 22 minutes of paid sick time.\n\nSome workers at Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, reported similar\nproblems getting sick pay. One employee in the New York area, who asked to\nremain anonymous to avoid potential retaliation, told me he started having\nflu-like symptoms on March 14. A doctor told him he could not be tested for\nCOVID-19, because tests were being rationed, but that he should stay home from\nwork until 48 hours after his symptoms had abated. His regional HR office told\nhim he did not qualify for the company\u2019s two weeks of quarantine pay, because\nhe did not have a positive COVID-19 test or a county quarantine order.\n\n[Read: Grocery stores are the coronavirus tipping\npoint](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/can-you-get-\ncoronavirus-grocery-store/608659/)\n\nMuch of the focus in recent weeks has, rightly, been on the safety of health-\ncare workers and other first responders. But the people who allow Americans on\nlockdown to get groceries and deliveries are, in many ways, also vulnerable\nand indispensable. And they\u2019re growing frustrated that they\u2019re not treated as\nsuch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the few essential businesses that doesn\u2019t have valorization in\nthe culture as first-responder heroes,\u201d said another Whole Foods worker in\nChicago, who requested anonymity because he feared he would be fired. He\u2019s an\nasthmatic whose sick-pay situation is still unclear. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been\ntreated as disposable, and now we have to go to work.\u201d\n\nFor some workers, it\u2019s already too late. William Elmore, a Walmart employee in\nthe Spokane area, came down with what he thought might be COVID-19 on February\n20. He told me he got in touch with his company\u2019s personnel manager and\nrequested a leave of absence, which was approved, so he stayed home from work\nfor the next two days. Once he was back at work on February 23, he said, his\nboss told him he had too many attendance \u201cpoints,\u201d and he would be let go. A\nfew weeks later, Walmart announced it would be [offering paid sick\nleave](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/03/12/companies-pressured-offer-paid-\nsick-leave-covid19/) to employees with COVID-19. Elmore said he won\u2019t be\neligible to be rehired until August, when his points reset.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

(KBTX) -** Sanderson Farms tells KBTX it is taking extra steps\nafter two employees tested positive for COVID-19 at its facility in Bryan.\n\nA spokeswoman says the company has identified and mandated employees who work\nin close proximity with the two employees to self-quarantine for 14 days with\npay.\n\n\"If they do not experience fever or other symptoms of COVID-19, they are asked\nto return to work after 14 days. We are unable to disclose any specific\ndetails related to these individuals due to privacy laws,\" said Hilary\nBurroughs, Director of Marketing for Sanderson Farms.\n\n\"While there are no known indications that COVID-19 is transferable through\nfood, our safety team is following guidance from public health organizations,\nincluding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health\nOrganization,\" said Burroughs.\n\n\"At Sanderson Farms, we believe everyone deserves access to safe, quality\nchicken \u2014 especially in times of uncertainty. Now more than ever, it is\nimportant that we do what is necessary to continue operating at the highest\nlevel possible to ensure a constant supply of safe, high-quality chicken to\nour nation,\" said Burroughs.\n\nChanges at the facility include:  \n-Installation of additional hand sanitizing stations throughout their facilities.  \n-Checking temperatures of employees before they enter facilities; if over 100\u00b0F, the employee is sent home with pay until cleared to return by a healthcare provider.  \n-Notifying and coordinating response procedures with all pertinent parties (local health officials, onsite USDA inspector, Sanderson Farms HR, and facility Division Manager).  \n-Notifying associates who were potentially exposed to the affected employee and asking them to self-quarantine for 14 days with pay.   \n-Thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the entire facility beyond the full sanitation that all of the company's facilities undergo every 24 hours, and with additional sanitization conducted in high traffic areas. These procedures strictly follow the CDC guidelines for this process. \n\nPrecautions include travel restrictions for employees, growers, contractors,\nand vendors.\n\nOn March 30, the company announced it was implementing a temporary weekly\nattendance bonus equivalent to $1 per hour for each hour worked if they have\nperfect attendance.\n\n\u201cBy offering a weekly bonus for employees, we hope to show our appreciation\nfor their hard work and contribution to maintaining the U.S. food supply\nduring this critical period,\u201d said Lampkin Butts, Sanderson Farms president,\nand chief operating officer. \u201cWhen Sanderson Farms employees come to work each\nday, they are supporting not only themselves and their families, but the\nentire nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur top priority is keeping our employees safe and healthy. Sanderson Farms\nis doing everything it can to protect its employees while they are at work,\u201d\nsaid Butts. \u201cThe company consults daily with physicians and other health\nexperts on how best to ensure employee wellbeing.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[ ](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Local-church-leaders-partner-with-\nHealth-District-to-offer-spiritual-hotline-569461261.html)\n\n#### [Spiritual hotline now available for Brazos County\nresidents](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Local-church-leaders-partner-\nwith-Health-District-to-offer-spiritual-hotline-569461261.html)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Several-Grimes-County-employees-\nincluding-county-judge-now-in-self-quarantine-569463221.html)\n\n#### [Several Grimes County employees, including county judge, now in self-\nquarantine](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Several-Grimes-County-employees-\nincluding-county-judge-now-in-self-quarantine-569463221.html)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Local-nurse-heads-to-COVID-19-hot-spot-\nto-assist-health-care-workers-569461251.html)\n\n#### [Local nurse heads to New York to assist health care workers with\nCOVID-19](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Local-nurse-heads-to-COVID-19-hot-\nspot-to-assist-health-care-workers-569461251.html)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Lake-Somerville-visitors-sent-home-\nfollowing-Gov-Abbotts-order-closing-state-parks-569460941.html)\n\n#### [Lake Somerville visitors sent home following orders to close all state\nparks](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Lake-Somerville-visitors-sent-home-\nfollowing-Gov-Abbotts-order-closing-state-parks-569460941.html)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ](https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Madisonville-Police-Sergeant-honored-\nafter-passing-earlier-this-week-569459211.html)\n\n#### [Local law enforcement officers welcome Sgt.

However,\nstrategies to make things happen are often forgotten, left under the piles of\nother tasks that need to be done to make a business run smoothly.\n\nThat's just what Microsoft Canada's chief learning officer, Magdy Karam spoke\nabout during the keynote talk at the 2020 HRD Learning and Development\nMasterclass in Toronto. More than a third of HR leaders across the globe\nbelieve one of the biggest challenges this year is developing a learning\nculture to support new skill development, according to a Gartner survey.\n\n![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637199569883493717.JPG)\n\n Karam spoke about the important of prioritizing a learning culture, how\ntechnology can help, and how organizations with strong learning cultures\nactually result in more productivity, innovation and an increase in profit.\n\nThe workshop brought close to 100 like-minded human resources leaders from\nacross Canada and from varying industries together to discuss the evolution in\nworkplace learning, as well as hear from some of the most successful leaders\nin the field.\n\nMark Thompson, president and chief engagement officer at McKinley Solutions\nmoderated a panel on creating strong middle managers and supervisors at the\nevent. The room was buzzing with excitement as he facilitated \"mini\ndiscussions\" on each table to encourage sharing ideas and workshopping issues\nwith peers. Sitting on the panel was leadership effectiveness coach David\nBurleigh who drew from his experience in leadership roles at BMO,\n[PwC](/ca/companies/pwc/120865) and Rogers, as well as Ian Daley, host of The\nNew Leader Podcast and former director of learning and development at Novo\nNordisk Canada.\n\n![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637199570515697749.JPG)\n\nWith learning and development programs and strategies taking place mostly at\nmid-level and supervisory levels, it was a great opportunity to discuss how\ncompany leaders can support their middle managers and ensure that\norganizational values are aligned.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/ca/specialization/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218773)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218773)\n\n![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637199572557160820.jpg)\n\nWith COVID-19 a growing concern across the globe, event executives and venue\nmanagement took extra precautions to ensure health standards were optimal and\nthe event can go on without concerns.

View the full release here:\n<https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200407005656/en/>\n\n![All Respondents, November 2019 to January, 2020 \\(Photo: Business\nWire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200407005656/en/783698/4/first-\nsnapshot.jpg)  \n\nAll Respondents, November 2019 to January, 2020 (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nAfter a successful completion of its initial $3 million capital investment led\nby SoftBank Capital NY and the launch of its live mediation, sleep music and\nfitness classes last year, the company has witnessed rapid growth of over 200\nenterprise clients in less than a year. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the\ncompany is adding 10+ companies a day to their platform and has been offering\ncompanies a free, 90-day trial for new enterprise customers in hopes of easing\nstress in the nation.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nWellness Coach analyzed a sample 100+ companies and thousands of anonymous\nemployee wellness class usage data to show overall trends. For vertical\nresults, the company looked at 10+ companies in the vertical to draw vertical\nconclusions.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n  * After seeing a normal drop-off in emotional intelligence, focus, stress and relaxation class attendance over the November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 timeframe as employees spent more time with family over the holidays, the company saw an 86% increase in fitness class attendance due to New Year's resolutions \n  * As the COVID-19 pandemic became more pronounced in March, class attendance related to stress increased 52% month-over-month, with emotional intelligence classes dropping by 32% and relaxation classes increasing by 17% month-over-month \n  * As it relates to the heavily hit Advertising and Travel sectors, \n    * Fitness classes increased by 250% (yoga, fitness and home fitness) month-over-month \n    * Relaxation Increased by 70% (working from home, listing to music while working) \n    * Stress-related classes increased 60% (more breathing exercises, anxiety exercise) \n    * Emotional intelligence classes dropped by 48%, \n    * Sleep (bedtime stories, sleep meditations and music) dropped by 25%, \n\n\"The Employee Wellness Index gives companies a real-time look at the needs of\ntheir employees, based on the classes employees are attending,\" said D.\nSharma, Co-Founder and CEO of Wellness Coach. \"The impact on COVID-19 related,\nemployee stress is significant. We are seeing a shift from more work-related\nclasses (emotional intelligence) to stress management tools. Work from home\nand the harder-hit travel and advertising sector saw a much higher increase in\nstress, as they are coping with taking care of their body and mind by working\nout, relaxing and using tools to alleviate stress.\"\n\n**Background**\n\nFor decades, employers have relied on archaic surveys to understand employee\nengagement and morale. Now, with the enterprise \"Employee Wellness Index,\"\nemployers have insights to their employees most basic needs, including\nFitness, Focus, Relaxation, Emotional Intelligence, Stress, Sleep and\nNutrition. Employers track these metrics month-over-month to see how internal\nenterprise factors affect the needs of employees and then take steps to\nimprove employee overall wellness. The Employee Wellness Index can be provided\nby various office locations to help companies with larger, global teams know\nthe needs of their employees, companywide.\n\n**About D.

seconds after the invention of the personal computer, people\n[predicted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221599339_The_Death_of_Distance_The_Influence_of_Computer_Mediated_Communication_on_Perceptions_of_Distance)\nthat our jobs would eventually be emancipated from the office, and home would\nbe the thrilling future of work.\n\nConsider me your correspondent from the future. And let me tell you, as\nsomeone working from home this week, it\u2019s not entirely thrilling. My desk is a\nkitchen counter, the constant cleaning of which makes for good\nprocrastination, and my cafeteria is an emergency-stocked fridge, the routine\nraiding of which makes for even better procrastination.\n\n[Read: The problem with telling sick workers to stay\nhome](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-could-\nhit-american-workers-especially-hard/607213/)\n\nJoining me this week are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people\ntaking refuge from the coronavirus. Not all, to be sure. According to the\n[Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/flex2.t01.htm),\nonly 29 percent of Americans can work from home, including one in 20 service\nworkers and more than half of information workers. So while servers are still\nmanning the restaurants, the technology sector has effectively gone remote.\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Twitter, and Airbnb have all asked at least some of\ntheir employees to stay away from the office.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has triggered an anxious trial run for remote work at\na grand scale. What we learn in the next few months could help shape a future\nof work that might have been inevitable, with or without a once-in-a-century\npublic-health crisis.\n\nEven before the pandemic struck, remote work was accelerating in the U.S. The\nshare of the labor force that works from home tripled in the past 15 years,\naccording to the Federal Reserve. Two of the accelerants are obvious: living\ncosts in metros with the highest density of knowledge workers, and technology,\nsuch as Slack and Microsoft Teams, that moves collaboration and gossip online.\n\nBut the early returns from America\u2019s home offices are mixed. In _The_ _New\nYork Times_ , Kevin Roose\n[writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/technology/working-from-home.html)\nfrom his makeshift quarantine bunker that remote work impedes the creative\nsparks that fly when we are interacting with actual people rather than their\nthumbnails on Slack.\n\nIn the 2016 paper \u201cDoes Working From Home Work?\u201d a team of economists looked\nat Ctrip, a 16,000-employee Chinese travel agency that had randomly assigned a\nsmall group of its call-center staff to work from home. At first, the\nexperiment seemed like a win-win for workers and owners. Employees worked\nmore, quit less, and said they were happier with their job. Meanwhile, the\ncompany saved more than $1,000 per employee on reduced office space. But when\nCtrip rolled out this policy to the entire company, it caused a mess. One\ncomplaint swamped everything else: _Loneliness_.\n\nBeyond lost creativity and companionship, the gravest threat to many companies\nfrom remote work is that it breaks the social bonds that are necessary to\nproductive teamwork. Several years ago, Google conducted a research project on\nits most productive groups. The company found that the most important quality\nwas [\u201cpsychological safety\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-\ngoogle-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)\u2014a confidence\nthat team members wouldn\u2019t embarrass or punish individuals for speaking up.\n\n[Read: Agoraphobia and the\ntelecommuter](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/agoraphobia-\nand-the-telecommuter/379483/)\n\nBut online communications can be a minefield for psychological safety,\naccording to Bill Duane, a former Google engineer who now works remotely as a\ncorporate consultant and researcher. \u201cWhenever we read a sentence on Gchat or\nSlack that seems ambiguous or sarcastic to us, we default to thinking, _You\nfucker!_ \u201d Duane told me. \u201cBut if someone had said the same thing to your\nface, you might be laughing with them.\u201d\n\nOffice banter, bad jokes, and even unctuous corporate talk in the hallways can\nbe dismissed as empty blather. But Duane calls these things \u201cthe carrier wave\nfor psychological safety.\u201d Almost everything that doesn\u2019t feel like work at\nthe office is what makes the most creative, most productive work at the office\npossible.\n\nRemote work might not work for many people in the future. But the status quo\nis already failing millions of people.\n\nAs jobs concentrate in downtown areas without affordable housing, workers\u2019\nhomes are pushed into the far suburbs. The American commute is a\n[psychological and environmental\nscourge](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/06/is-your-commute-\nkilling-you/239903/) that increases depression, divorce, and fossil-fuel\nemissions. The average commute in the U.S. recently hit [an all-time\nrecord](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/07/nine-days-road-\naverage-commute-time-reached-new-record-last-year/) of 27 minutes one-way.\nThat\u2019s almost an hour a day spent away from friends and family, in a machine\ncoughing fumes into the sky. Allowing people to work closer to home\u2014whether at\na coffee shop, in a co-working space, or on a couch\u2014could be a win for work-\nlife balance, for happiness, and for the biosphere.\n\nThe geographic concentration of jobs also means that the powerful industries\nare clustered in a handful of rich cities. Eighty percent of U.S. venture-\ncapital investment goes to just three states\u2014California, New York, and\nMassachusetts\u2014and about 70 percent of all internet-publishing jobs are either\nin the Acela corridor between Washington and Boston or the western crescent\nfrom Seattle to Phoenix. A future with remote work might annoy some, but that\nannoyance must be weighed against an alternative future where much of the\nmiddle class is financially barred from corporate headquarters in finance,\nmedia, and tech.\n\n\u201cWith housing shortages on the coasts, you have more extremely talented people\nliving outside those metros,\u201d said Hiten Shah, an entrepreneur and adviser to\nremote-work companies such as Automattic. \u201cAs a result, companies have to\nbuild remote-work features into their culture to get access to that talent.\u201d\n\nAnother downside of headquarter-based work is that the concentration of labor\nin high-income metros can attract people from the same socioeconomic pool, who\nshare the same ideas and blind spots. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s not talked about\nenough is that being distributed, you have a less homogenous culture,\u201d said\nGabriel Weinberg, the founder of the search engine DuckDuckGo, whose workforce\nis distributed around the world. \u201cWorking remotely, people are never forced to\nget a drink after work. You\u2019re not substituting work socialness for community\nsocialness. They are in their own communities. So you\u2019re really getting real\ndiversity of thought.\u201d\n\nI have presented two pictures of remote work. In one picture, it is a desolate\nand lonely experience that often saps creativity and collapses the narrow\ndistance between labor and downtime. In the next picture, it is a boon to\nsocial life, family life, egalitarianism, neurodiversity, and the planet\nitself. The messiness of the remote-work picture is a sign of the idea\u2019s\ninfancy.\n\n[Read: The dos and don\u2019ts of \u2018social\ndistancing\u2019](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-\nwhat-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/)\n\n\u201cRight now, remote work isn\u2019t working for most companies,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nbecause we spent the last 120 years learning how people can be productive in\nan office.\u201d The rise of the telegraph and the railroad in the late 19th\ncentury didn\u2019t just give us retail, advertising, and mass distribution; it\nalso gave us managerial capitalism\u2014middle managers, top managers, and modern\nhierarchies at corporate headquarters. The 21st-century economy has already\nchanged retail, advertising, and mass distribution. Perhaps inevitably it will\nalso change work and management.\n\nBut first, companies will have to learn that remote work is different work.\nManagers will have to get better at judging productivity by setting and\nmonitoring specific goals rather than using the proxy of office attendance.\nWorkers will have to adopt extraordinary conscientiousness when it comes to\ndividing their day into deep work, office communications, personal time, and\ncivic or family life. Employees will have to develop new habits, such as\nkeeping copious documentation of every meaningful work interaction, so that\nteams across space and time are always up to speed on what\u2019s happening \u201cdown\nthe hall.\u201d And bosses will have to normalize more video conferencing and\ncorporate retreats, because their employees will continue to crave face-to-\nface interaction.\n\nIn the current panic, Twitter is filled with rosy predictions that the virus\nwill be an inflection point in the future of distributed work. But a pandemic\nis not an appropriate time to determine what kind of labor arrangement is\noptimally productive on a per-worker basis. It is rather a moment for\ncompanies to build out the kind of technology and culture that, when the\neconomy is back to full force, could make remote work easier for those who\nwant to take advantage of it in a future where white-collar work might involve\na little less commuting and a little more home.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

[enhanced social distancing\nmeasures](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-tightens-social-\ndistancing-measures-amid-recent-spike-in-imported-covid-19-cases/) kicked in\nlast week in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19. In line with the additional\nmeasures, which will see more employees having reduced work hours, in the last\n24 hours, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry\nof Law (MOL), and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) came up with several\nadvisories and legal updates.\n\nThis includes guidelines on supporting employees with a second job\narrangement, a reminder on telecommuting, upcoming legal certainty on holding\nof meetings, and support for individuals and SMEs affected by the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nRead the full updates below.\n\n* * *\n\n### MOM: When reducing work hours, employers should support employees to take\non a second job where needed\n\nIn response to COVID-19, MOM advised employers to support affected employees\nduring this period to take on a second job such as part-time or temporary\nwork, waive contractual prohibitions against taking on a second job, and help\nemployees resolve conflicts of interest where possible.\n\nIn a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ministry-of-\nmanpower_httpswwwmomgovsgemployment-practices-\nactivity-6650560234546921472-z0wr/) yesterday, the ministry shared a [guide on\nsecond job arrangements](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/second-job-\narrangements) for employees with reduced work hours, which stated:\n\nEmployees can take on a second job, unless there are:\n\n  * Prohibitions in their current employment contract from taking on other forms of work; and/or\n  * Conflict of interest with their current employment.\n\nIf one or both of the abovementioned are present, and the employee still\nwishes to take up a second job to supplement their reduced income, the\nemployee should discuss and clarify with both employers should there be\nconflict of interest or conflict in work scheduling.\n\n**Employers should be considerate and supportive** and are **encouraged to\nwaive contractual prohibitions against taking on a second job** and help\nemployees resolve conflicts of interest where possible given that they\ninitiated the reduced work hours and reduced salaries to save costs.\n\nWhereas, employees should ensure that they are able to take on both jobs\nwithout compromising the interests of each employer and be transparent in\nterms of the requirements of both jobs to their employers. This would help to\nprevent downstream disputes over work schedules, salaries and other employment\nbenefits.\n\nThe guide also underlined key principles on sharing responsibilities between\nfirst and second employer.\n\n**First employer**\n\nIf you are the **first employer** you are responsible for **salaries** , **CPF\ncontributions** , as well as **statutory and contractual benefits** for the\nperiod employees are scheduled to work for you. All these may be pro-rated\nbased on the reduced work hours.\n\nThe **first employer is not responsible for** **any contractual or statutory\nobligations for the period when employees are working for their second\nemployer**.\n\n**Second employer**\n\nIf you are the **second employer** , for the period when employees are\nscheduled to work for you, you are responsible for **fulfilling the key terms\nand conditions specified in the employment contract**.\n\nThe **second employer is encouraged to provide employees with sick leave\nentitlement and medical benefits** even though the employment duration may be\nless than three months.\n\nThe second employer should note that under the Employment Act, employees who\nhave worked for three months or more are entitled to paid outpatient sick\nleave and paid hospitalisation leave.\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/01105455/Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-10.54.11-AM.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ministry-\nof-manpower_httpswwwmomgovsgemployment-practices-\nactivity-6650560234546921472-z0wr/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Josephine Teo: Fines and other penalties for companies that do not allow\ntelecommuting wherever possible\n\nIn a press conference yesterday, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said MOM\nis looking at levelling fines and other penalties on such companies, who do\nnot arrange for flexible work arrangements that might help to stop the spread\nof the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to\n_[CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-firms-do-not-\nallow-telecommuting-stop-work-order-12594322),_ who attended the video press\nconference held by the multi-ministry task force, the Government will,\nhowever, take a measured approach to this by looking first at the firm's\nspecific circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf the company is really not taking it seriously at all, then we have no\nchoice and will not hesitate to issue a stop-work order,\u201d she said, adding\nthat the duration of such an order would depend on factors such as the\nseverity of the case.\n\nWhile the public sector is taking the lead (with some agencies having up to\n90% of their staff telecommuting), and 80% of workers were telecommuting at\nsome private companies; MOM estimated that for companies in the Central\nBusiness District, only 40% of workers were telecommuting.\n\n\u201cSo there is a lot of scope for us to do more, especially the private sector\nfirms. I want to emphasise this, employers must allow your employees to work\nfrom home, as far as reasonably practicable,\u201d Teo said.\n\nShe added that companies in certain sectors, such as manufacturing, that may\nnot necessarily be able to implement work-from-home arrangements should\nimplement safe distancing measures for their staff when interacting with\nothers, including external parties such as customers or vendors. Companies\nshould also introduce staggered working hours, such that staff arrive and\nleave work at different times.\n\nThe minister said that MOM plans to have more than 100 officers check on\ncompanies who have not implemented flexible work arrangements, a five-fold\nincrease from the current figure.\n\nMOM would also look into enhancing the Work-Life Grant, which provides\ncompanies with up to S$70,000 over two years to offer staff flexible work\narrangements such as working from home.\n\n\u201cCompanies that need help implementing telecommuting can approach the\nSingapore Manufacturing Federation, the Employment and Employability Institute\nor the Singapore National Employers Federation for assistance on how to do\nso,\u201d she said.\n\n* * *\n\n### New legislation to be introduced next week to provide legal certainty on\nthe holding of meetings\n\nOn 27 March 2020, the Infectious Diseases (Measures to Prevent Spread of\nCOVID-19) Regulations 2020 (Regulations) came into force.\n\nUnder the Regulations, certain activities and events (e.g. conventions) are\nprohibited altogether while attendance for non-prohibited events (including\nmeetings and gatherings) is limited to 10 individuals. Safe distancing\nmeasures were also imposed for events held in public places.\n\nAll meetings must be held in accordance with the prevailing Regulations issued\nto implement safe distancing measures.\n\nA [joint press release by MOF and MOL](https://www.mof.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-\nReleases/covid-19-relief-measures-upcoming-legislative-provisions-to-provide-\nlegal-certainty-on-holding-of-meetings) noted that the Government is aware\nthat certain provisions in written law and certain legal instruments (such as\na company\u2019s constitution) provide for [personal attendance at\nmeetings](https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/default-\nsource/newsroom/annex.pdf?sfvrsn=fc68ab67_2).\n\nTo provide clarity on how to comply with both those provisions and the\nRegulations, the Government will introduce new legislation at the next sitting\nof Parliament (on or about 7 April 2020) (Proposed Provisions) to provide\nlegal certainty on the holding of such meetings.\n\nSubject to Parliament\u2019s approval, the Proposed Provisions will:\n\n  * Allow alternative arrangements to be prescribed where: \n    * Personal attendance at a meeting or class of meetings is provided for in any written law or legal instrument; and\n    * It is not suitable or not possible for the meeting or class of meetings to be convened, held or conducted in the manner provided for in the written law or legal instrument, in view of the prevailing Regulations; and\n  * Provide that meetings held or deferred, on or after 27 March 2020, in accordance with the prescribed alternative arrangements will be deemed to satisfy the relevant requirements under written law or legal instrument, despite anything to the contrary in any law or legal instrument.\n\nIf passed, the Proposed Provisions are intended to be brought into force as\nsoon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, entities that are planning to conduct meetings and are\nuncertain about how to comply with the prevailing safe distancing measures\nwithout contravening provisions in written law or legal instruments should\napproach the respective regulators for guidance on how the meeting should be\nconducted.\n\nMeetings should minimally adopt the following:\n\n  * Allow and strongly encourage attendance at meetings using tele-conferencing, video-conferencing, or other electronic means;\n  * Allow meeting attendees to appoint their proxies using electronic means, such as by e-mail;\n  * Allow meeting attendees with rights to participate, to exercise these rights to the extent possible and appropriate, such as by allowing questions to be submitted by e-mail in advance, and responses to be conveyed by tele-conferencing, video-conferencing, or other electronic means;\n  * If voting is required, strongly encourage meeting attendees to vote by proxy, or (if available) by electronic modes of voting; and\n  * Provide meeting attendees with access to meeting materials.\n\n* * *\n\n### New measures to help SMEs facing temporary cashflow difficulties\n\nThe MAS, together with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), the Life\nInsurance Association (LIA), the General Insurance Association (GIA), and the\nFinance Houses Association of Singapore (FHAS), yesterday [announced a package\nof measures to help ease the financial strain on individuals and\nSMEs](https://www.sgpc.gov.sg/sgpcmedia/media_releases/mas/press_release/P-20200331-2/attachment/MAS%20media%20release_MAS%20and%20Financial%20Industry%20to%20Support%20Individuals%20and%20SMEs%20Affected%20by%20the%20COVID-19%20Pandemic%20_31%20Mar%202020_FINAL.pdf)\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe package of financial measures complements the initiatives in the\nGovernment\u2019s Unity Budget and Resilience Budget to preserve jobs and support\nenterprises and households.\n\nThe package has three components:\n\n  * help individuals meet their loan and insurance commitments;\n  * support SMEs with continued access to bank credit and insurance cover; and\n  * ensure interbank funding markets remain liquid and well-functioning.\n\nThe relief for individuals and SMEs will be provided on an opt-in basis and\nthe financial institutions will process all applications expeditiously. MAS\ncautions that deferring payments increases future obligations and advises\nborrowers and policyholders to weigh their options carefully.\n\nZooming in on the measures for SMEs, Banks and finance companies in Singapore\nhave committed to help ease the financial strain on SMEs arising from the need\nto make principal repayments on their loans during this period, in view of the\ntemporary cashflow constraints that many may face.\n\nThree key areas SMEs will receive help on are:\n\n**#1 Defer payment of principal on secured SME loans**\n\nSMEs may opt to defer principal payments on their secured term loans up to 31\nDecember 2020, subject to banks\u2019 and finance companies\u2019 assessment of the\nquality of the SMEs\u2019 security. SMEs will also be able to extend the tenure of\ntheir loans by up to the corresponding principal deferment period if they\nwish. This relief will be available to SMEs that continue to pay interest and\nare in good standing with their banks and finance companies (not more than 90\ndays past due as of 6 April 2020).\n\nIt is estimated that more than S$40 billion of existing loan facilities to\nSMEs will likely qualify for this opt-in relief scheme. Besides secured term\nloans, banks and finance companies also stand ready to work with SME customers\nto adjust their loan repayment schedules for other types of loan facilities.\n\n**#2 Lower interest on SME loans**\n\nBanks and finance companies may apply for low-cost funding through a new MAS\nSGD Facility for loans granted under Enterprise Singapore\u2019s SME Working\nCapital Loan scheme and Temporary Bridging Loan Programme. Banks and finance\ncompanies can apply for these funds until end December 2020, provided they\ncommit to pass on the savings in funding cost to their SME borrowers.\n\nThis initiative will potentially lower the interest rates charged to eligible\nSME borrowers. Details will be provided at a later date.\n\n**#3 Assistance with insurance premium payment**\n\nCorporates, including SMEs, holding general insurance policies that protect\ntheir business and property risks may apply to their insurer for instalment\npayment plans. General insurance companies stand ready to work with their\ncorporate customers so they can pay their premiums in smaller amounts and\nenjoy coverage for the paid-up period, instead of paying a lump sum premium\nfor the entire policy period at the start.\n\n_Photo /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/sg)_\n\n* * *\n\n### Human Resources Online is on Telegram!

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation. The driver to JuzTalent's success by acquiring 50,000\nusers within three years has been due to understanding HR and complex payroll\nissues that every business will face in the different part of Southeast Asia.\n\nJuzTalent was built by professionals with deep HR understanding. It is a one-\nof-a-kind HRMS focused on the user\u2019s experience \u2013 from the effortless self-\nservice onboarding to radius clock-in and clock-out, personalised payslips,\nand not forgetting management and leaders are sent light-hearted notifications\nto keep the whole claim and leave processes moving.\n\nFurthermore, every client of JuzTalent is greeted with a realistic drawing of\nproblem-solving and results based insights. Whether it be small or mid-sized\nbusinesses, JuzTalent is able to provide an overview connecting an\norganisation\u2019s multiple entities operating under a single platform while they\nfocus and grow with autonomy.\n\n### BIPO\n\n[**www.biposervice.com**](http://www.biposervice.com)\n\n**+65 6877 6925**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-the-\nbest-1-250x141.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-\nthe-best-1.jpg)Founded in 2004, BIPO\u2019s Asia-Pacific Headquarters is in\nSingapore, with R&D Centres located in Singapore, Shanghai, Malaysia and\nIndonesia.\n\nBIPO\u2019s integrated, one-stop cloud and mobile-based HRMS platform helps\nbusinesses simplify and streamline HR processes. From payroll, leave\nmanagement, and claims to time and attendance management, each application is\ninterrelated yet easily customised to help businesses scale-up their\noperations with ease.\n\nOffering a great user-experience through its simple, user-friendly interface,\nBIPO\u2019s award-winning **time and attendance management system** uses technology\nsuch as GPS, biometrics and iris scanners to support its clocking devices,\nallowing employees who are constantly on-the-move to stay agile and connected.\n\nCompliant with local regulatory requirements across all the regions, BIPO\u2019s\nHRMS platform is LHDN-certified (PCB \u2013 Monthly Tax Deduction Calculation) in\nMalaysia and in Singapore, adheres to CPF and IRA8 online submission\nrequirements.\n\n### JUST LOGIN\n\n[**www.justlogin.com**](https://justlogin.com)\n\n**+65 6909 9217**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest-250x188.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest.jpg)In the last decade, the role of\nHRIS has shifted beyond just storing and tracking of employee data. In the new\nworld of instant gratification and everything \"on demand\", it is also about\nproviding both employees and managers the information they need when they need\nit.\n\n[JustLogin](https://justlogin.com/?utm_source=hrmasia&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=top-\nfive-hris)\u2019s shift from just an HRIS to a mobile-first, employee-centric app\nresonates with today's progressive workforce which places employees in the\ncentre of all HR decisions.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, rolled out by\nthe Department of Labor, requires employers to provide employees with\nemergency paid sick leave (EPSL) or expanded family and medical leave (EFMLA)\nfor specified reasons related to COVID-19. These new provisions will go into\neffect on April 1, 2020 and expire December 31, 2020.\n\n> AMGtime\u2019s team of developers has been working tirelessly to update its\n> software to reflect the new labor requirements regarding paid sick leave.\n> AMGtime has implemented various changes in its software as a solution to the\n> new guidance by the US DOL. The overall goal for AMGtime is to make\n> processing payroll for its users feasible and easy to maneuver if they were\n> to encounter any related situation with their employees.\n\nThe act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for up to\ntwo weeks of emergency paid sick leave (EPSL-Self) if the employee is unable\nto work because he or she is subject to quarantine by state, federal or local\ngovernment order as well as if the individual is experiencing symptoms of\nCOVID-19. If any employee, however, is unable to work because they are caring\nfor an individual who is subject to quarantine by the same entities stated\nearlier or care for a child whose school or place of care is closed, they are\neligible for up to two-thirds the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay of emergency\npaid sick leave (EPSL-Other). For employees who have been employed for at\nleast 30 days and need to care for a child whose school or place of care is\nshut down, they will receive up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded\nfamily and medical leave (EFMLA) at two-thirds an employee\u2019s regular rate.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nAMGtime is a national leader of time, attendance, and workforce scheduling. In\naddition to customizable and scalable software on both cloud and PC, AMGtime\noffers a variety of biometric devices and mobile applications. A preferred\npartner across multiple industries such as skilled nursing, staffing, and\nconstruction, due to their innovative industry specific solutions.

For compliance purposes, it\u2019s increasingly important that\nevery business has a reliable way to track employee hours as the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor prepares to revise the [federal overtime\nregulation](https://www.paychex.com/articles/compliance/proposed-overtime-\nlaw?). For business growth purposes, employee attendance provides business\nowners and HR leaders with valuable insight that helps to measure the overall\n\u201chealth\u201d of the organization. Comparing actual hours worked to scheduled\nhours, for example, allows an employer to view data that impacts the business\nsuch as the number of absences, tardiness, and sick days taken in the last\nweek, month, or year. This data can be leveraged to measure employee\nperformance as well.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d8221ab3026a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization\u2026.\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThough every business needs a time and attendance tracking solution,\ncompanies\u2019 requirements vary greatly when it comes to choosing the right tool.\nSmall companies with fewer employees don\u2019t require solutions that support\nmultiple locations, different employee types, and layers of management; but\nlarger companies may need more complex system functionality to automate manual\nprocesses and security elements to help ensure their employees are accurately\nreporting their time worked. Employees in a corporate environment can easily\nclock in and out on their computers each day, while manufacturing employees\nmay not have access to a PC or mobile device during business hours.\n\nAcross all business sizes, industries, and more, there are time tracking\nsolutions to meet everyone\u2019s needs, including:\n\n  * **Hardware Time Clocks:** Employees who work at the same location every day, do not have access to a PC, and are not permitted to use their personal device during business hours would most likely leverage a hardware time clock. Time clocks typically require an established network connection and a power source to send/receive data, so it\u2019s important that this tool have offline capabilities or battery backups to keep the system running in the event of a power outage or network issue. Hardware time clocks are commonly mounted to a wall near an area where employees begin and end their shifts.  \n\n  * **Mobile Devices** : Smartphones and tablets introduce a level of flexibility and ease of use that a hardware time clock does not. Mobile provides the convenience of a multi-purpose device that goes beyond being used solely for time tracking. Mobile devices can be easily transportable to and from multiple work locations and require little to no training for an employee to get started. Many mobile time and attendance tracking solutions offer security measures such as geolocation and geofencing, ensuring employees are recording their time from permitted locations. Mobile apps can also provide offline capabilities allowing employees to record their time when a Wi-Fi or cellular signal is not available.  \n\n  * **PCs** : Recording time worked on the web is typically done through a PC or laptop provided by the company. This option is perfect for an office environment with stationary employees but won\u2019t work as well for a company with field workers in different locations.  \n\n  * **Biometric** : Biometric clocks use an image of a hand, fingerprint, or face that is converted into a mathematical algorithm as a basis for employee identification. On the plus side, biometric time tracking helps prevent \"buddy punching,\" where one employee punches in under another employee's badge number. It also diminishes the time-consuming hassle of lost badges and cards. However, these tools have raised some privacy concerns based on incorrect perceptions that all biometric clocks may store employees\u2019 actual fingerprints or face scans. Even if not required, it\u2019s recommended to obtain consent from employees in the form of an acknowledgment as a result of your staff\u2019s understanding of the solution.\n\n  \nNo matter which format a company chooses, today\u2019s time and attendance systems\ncan provide increased functionality beyond just punching in and punching out.\nMany offer additional features for both administrators and employee users,\nincluding built-in scheduling where administrators can schedule their\nemployees and, in return, employees can view the details of their work\nschedule, such as scheduled start and end times, where they are scheduled to\nwork, and what jobs they are assigned to complete during their shifts. Both\nworked hours and scheduled hours to provide a client with variance data which\ncan be leveraged to reduce future labor expenses.\n\nAutomating time and attendance can be a big step towards ensuring employees\nare paid accurately and on time. When time tracking and payroll are tightly\nintegrated, the benefits can include time savings, far less paperwork,\nincreased security, and a reduction in errors. To get the most out of their\nsolution and optimize these benefits, employers should take care in choosing a\ntime and attendance system that enables workers to record their time in a\nmanner that is suitable for their work environment.\n\n**Also Read:**[How to Efficiently Hire Gen Z Tech\nTalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nefficiently-hire-gen-z-tech-talent/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Fchoosing-the-right-time-and-attendance-tool-for-any-\nbusiness%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Choosing+the+Right+Time+and+Attendance+Tool+for+Any+Business\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Choosing+the+Right+Time+and+Attendance+Tool+for+Any+Business&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Fchoosing-the-right-time-and-attendance-tool-for-any-\nbusiness%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Fchoosing-the-right-time-and-attendance-tool-for-any-\nbusiness%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Fchoosing-the-right-time-and-attendance-tool-for-any-\nbusiness%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Choosing the Right Time and Attendance Tool\nfor Any\nBusiness&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Fchoosing-the-right-time-and-attendance-tool-for-any-\nbusiness%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Workforce Scheduling ](/category/workforce-scheduling/\n\"Workforce Scheduling\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Key Features of Attendance Management Systems](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/attendance_management_systems_5da0835b154ee.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workforce-scheduling/features-of-attendance-management-systems/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Key Features of Attendance Management Systems\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workforce-scheduling/features-of-\nattendance-management-systems/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nLooking for a digital alternative to legacy attendance management?

If the members of this\nteam are overwhelmed or don't have the resources they need to perform their\njobs, the entire organization will suffer. Fortunately, such a thing as HRIS\nsystems exists.\n\n**What are the types of HRIS systems?**  \nHuman resource information system (HRIS) refers to a software solution used in\nmanaging employees and in the procedures for keeping them engaged and\nproductive. HRIS systems typically fall into two categories, according to\nMitrefinch:\n\n**HCM**  \nThe systems that fall under the human capital management (HCM) category are\naimed at recruiting and retaining employees throughout their life cycle. They\ncan include anything from recruitment and onboarding tools to salary planning,\nbudgeting, goal-setting, and performance assessment. These tools assist the HR\nteam in guiding employees toward success.\n\nAnalytics are also an integral part of HCM solutions and can be useful in\ntracking employee red flags and predicting growth potential. These solutions\ntend to be more detailed than HRMS solutions and are often used in an\nexecutive-type white-collar setting.\n\n**HRMS**  \nHuman resource management systems (HRMS) may contain some elements of HCM\nsolutions, but they also have several tools to help employees as well. These\ninclude an efficient and flexible way for workers to clock in and out, manage\ntheir schedules, and easily communicate with colleagues even if they are\nworking remotely.\n\nOn the HR side, these solutions can be integrated into payroll and onboarding\nprocesses to make tasks easier for the HR team. They can also lessen the\nnumber of mistakes and improve the oversight that can be made with a manual\nprocess.\n\n**What are the components of HRIS systems?**  \nHRIS typically has six components, according to Bizfluent:\n\n**Company database**  \nAn essential HRIS system component is a database where all pieces of\ninformation about employees and company HR procedures will be stored for use\nin other HRIS tools. Aside from conveniently storing all data in a central\nlocation for easy access, this database comes with features to keep your data\nsecure, updated, and free from corruption.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nAutomated backups are a common feature that HRIS systems use to prevent data\nloss. Often, there's also access to technical support in case you have trouble\naccessing your data or experience an emergency.\n\n**Financial components**  \nHRIS also includes components for handling payroll, benefits, and employee\nrecognition programs. The payroll and benefits components will maintain\ninformation such as salary rates, commission and incentive plans, payment\naccounts, and paycheck deductions (e.g., taxes, retirement plans, and\ninsurance options).\n\nUsually, there are options to automate payouts, calculate taxes, and enroll in\nbenefits. If your organization rewards employees with bonuses or gift cards\nfor great work, financial components have reporting tools that can help\ndetermine these rewards.\n\n**Time and attendance**  \nAnother key HRIS component helps with keeping track of the time during which\nemployees work and any incidents of absence or tardiness. Such information can\nbe sent to the financial components to ensure that employees are paid fairly.\n\nAlso, these tools can automate employee scheduling, send managers alerts when\nattendance problems occur, and allow for documentation of time off and\nextended leave requests. Some systems even make it possible for employees to\nclock in remotely and support biometrics options.\n\n**Recruitment and onboarding**  \nHRIS systems come with components that ease the work done throughout the\nhiring process, including posting job applications, handling employee\nreferrals, sending interview requests, and tracking applicants. Often, you can\naccess applicant profiles, record notes from job interviews, conduct\nemployment tests, perform background checks, and send job-offer letters.\n\nOnce employees are hired, there are tools that can automate onboarding\nactivities such as document signing, new employee record keeping, and\ncompliance administration.\n\n**Employee management**  \nYou can use this component to track employee performance, make changes to\nemployees' personal information, document feedback from performance reviews,\nand maintain information about salary, benefits, and disciplinary history.\n\n**Training and development**  \nMost HRIS systems provide an option to design a training path for employees\nand even integrate training courses, tests, and professional certification\npreparation in a portal that employees can easily access. They also record\nemployees' progress and can even use work performance metrics to check whether\nthe training has helped employees improve and assign additional training\nexercises as needed.\n\nSince these tools can support employee ranking, they come in handy when\nconsidering which workers to promote. It's particularly helpful when deciding\nabout succession planning within your organization.\n\n**What are the benefits of HRIS systems?**  \nHere are four ways your organization can benefit from an HRIS, according to\nNamely:\n\n**Employee self-service**  \nAn HRIS stores all your company policies, benefits information, and company\nresources in one accessible location, so employees know exactly where to look\nfor the answers to all their questions. They can connect with colleagues,\nrequest time off, enroll in benefits, and check paystubs on demand from their\nlaptops and mobile devices without interrupting you.\n\n**Centralized employee communication**  \nInternal messages can get lost easily. An HRIS can act as the central hub for\nyour organization's internal communications. Modern HR systems offer a\nnewsfeed where the HR team can post announcements, recognize outstanding\nemployees, and share updates. The platform can also boost employee engagement\nby acknowledging employee birthdays, start dates, and work anniversaries.\n\n**Increased HR automation**  \nAs your organization grows, your time might be better spent on strategic\ninitiatives - not day-to-day administrative tasks. An HRIS can help streamline\nyour daily tasks by automating simple processes such as overseeing employee\nonboarding, benefits enrollment, and tax forms - giving you time to manage\nyour employees and focus on your team's initiatives.\n\n**Powerful people insights**  \nUsing an HRIS enables you to make more strategic decisions. By storing all\nyour company and employee data in one place, you get a more holistic view of\nyour organization and can better identify areas for improvement. Aside from\nHR, payroll and benefits, HR software typically offers powerful integrations\nwith other point solutions to move data seamlessly between systems. Using your\nHR data through consistent reporting not only helps your organization achieve\nits business goals but also empowers you to make more informed decisions and\nprove impact.\n\n**How much is an HRIS system?**  \nHRIS costs can vary from as low as $1 per month per employee to thousands of\ndollars a year. As for huge enterprise HRMS systems like PeopleSoft, SAP,\nSage, and Workday, they may cost larger firms thousands or even millions of\ndollars to implement. Fortunately, newer cloud-based HR software fills the gap\nfor small businesses by offering online HRMS systems that allow employers to\npay by employee or contractor (user) with no setup fee, with price ranging\nfrom about $1 to $15 per month per employee.\n\nWhen choosing an HRIS, these are the costs that you should consider, according\nto FitSmallBusiness:\n\n  * Software - HR software for small business costs between $1 and $15 per month per employee.

Bert Blyleven,\nwho was celebrating his 22nd birthday, held the A\u2019s offense to three runs, two\nearned, in a complete game effort.\n\n![](http://twinsdaily.com/uploads/63264933bd815062e17e31d7e1fc4e76.jpg)\n\n![Attached Image:\n0406chart.png](http://twinsdaily.com/uploads/monthly_04_2020/ccs-8747-0-86325100-1586133445_thumb.png)  \n**Twins 8, Oakland 3** [Box Score](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK197304060.shtml \"External link\")  \n **Blyleven** : 9 IP, 10 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 7 K  \n **Home Runs** : Oliva (1), Holt (1), Hisle (1)  \n **Multi-hit games** : Hisle (4-for-5, HR, 2B), Oliva (2-for-4, HR), Carew\n(2-for-5, 2B)  \n **Top 3 WPA** : Hisle .182, Oliva .170, Blyleven .135  \n _Chart via[Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK197304060.shtml \"External link\")_  \n  \nThere\u2019s possibly no better poster boy for the American League\u2019s new designated\nhitter position than Minnesota\u2019s Tony Oliva, so it\u2019s fitting he became the\nfirst player to hit a home run as a DH. Oliva, 34, played just 10 games last\nseason and is still recovering from knee surgery and a twisted ankle. Had he\nbeen required to play the outfield, it\u2019s unlikely Oliva would have been\npenciled into the lineup.  \n  \nInstead, Oliva cracked a homer to put the Twins up 3-0 in the top of the first\ninning. The Twins added a pair of runs in the second, and chased Hunter, who\nwas credited with two victories in last year's Fall Classic, out of the game\nafter just three innings.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe rubber-armed Blyleven, who ranked seventh in the majors with 287 1/3\ninnings pitched last season, was the beneficiary of all that offense. He\nsuccessfully negotiated the dangerous Oakland lineup, recording a clean inning\nin eight of his nine frames.  \n  \n\u201cThe change up saved me until I could get the curve over the plate,\u201d Blyleven\ntold Minneapolis Star staff writer Dan Stoneking. \u201cEven then it wasn\u2019t a good\ncurve.\u201d  \n  \nBlyleven capped a memorable 22nd birthday by striking out Joe Rudi and Reggie\nJackson in succession to close out the game.  \n  \n **LINKS**\n\n  * [Read more on Oliva\u2019s historic home run](https://www.twincities.com/2013/05/18/minnesota-twins-first-dh-tony-oliva-hit-landmark-hr-in-1973/ \"External link\") from the man himself via the Pioneer Press\u2019 Bob Sansevere.\n  * [Choose Your MVP: Re-evaluating the 1965 MVP Race](http://twinsdaily.com/_/minnesota-twins-news/minnesota-twins/choose-your-mvp-re-evaluating-the-1965-mvp-race-r9194) | Matthew Taylor\n  * [91/19 World Series, Game 7: Metrodome Madness Goes Extra Innings](http://twinsdaily.com/_/minnesota-twins-news/minnesota-twins/9119-world-series-game-7-metrodome-madness-goes-extra-innings-r9179) | Steve Lein\n  * [Snubbed: Revisiting: Johan Santana's One and Done Hall of Fame Case](http://twinsdaily.com/_/minnesota-twins-news/minnesota-twins/snubbed-revisiting-johan-santanas-one-and-done-hall-of-fame-case-r9195) | Cody Pirkl\n  * [Twins Flashback Recap: Stewart Hits Walk-Off Homer, Mauer Shines in MLB Debut (4/5/2004)](http://twinsdaily.com/_/minnesota-twins-news/minnesota-twins/twins-flashback-recap-stewart-hits-walk-off-homer-mauer-shines-in-mlb-debut-452004-r9197)\n\n **MORE FROM TWINS DAILY**  \n\u2014 Latest[ Twins coverage](http://twinsdaily.com/) from our writers  \n\u2014 Recent[ Twins discussion](http://twinsdaily.com/forum/6-minnesota-twins-\ntalk/) in our forums  \n\u2014 Follow Twins Daily via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twinsdaily \"External\nlink\"),[ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TwinsDaily \"External link\") or[\nemail](https://us8.list-\nmanage.com/subscribe?u=9985d44703aa630068820eb4a&id=624255d36f \"External\nlink\")\n\n  \n\n  * David HK, Dave The Dastardly and Doctor Gast like this \n\n  \n\n  * Share:\n  * [![](/public/style_images/generic/facebook-share.jpg)](javascript:fbshareCurrentPage\\(\\))\n  * [![](/public/style_images/generic/twitter-share.jpg)](javascript:;)\n  * [ ![submit to reddit](/public/style_images/generic/reddit-share.jpg) ](//www.reddit.com/submit)\n\n![](/images/ads/ads-advertisement-tracker.gif)\n\nSubscribe to Twins Daily Email\n\n  \n\nSubscribe to Twins Daily Email\n\n## 5 Comments\n\n![Photo](http://twinsdaily.com/public/style_images/twins/profile/default_large.png)\n\nDoctor Gast  \n\n[Yesterday, 07:26\nAM](http://twinsdaily.com/index.php?app=ccs&module=pages&section=comments&database=1&record=9200&do=findComment&comment_id=962626\n\"Get the permalink\")\n\nThis historic feat has been unfortunately over looked & even despised by HoF\nvoters\n\n  *     * Tom Froemming likes this \n\n![Photo](http://twinsdaily.com/uploads/profile/photo-\nthumb-8747.jpg?_r=1549984053)\n\nTom Froemming  \n\n[Yesterday, 08:35\nAM](http://twinsdaily.com/index.php?app=ccs&module=pages&section=comments&database=1&record=9200&do=findComment&comment_id=962630\n\"Get the permalink\")\n\n\n\n> This historic feat has been unfortunately over looked & even despised by HoF\n> voters\n\nIt's funny to look back at how sour some of the coverage surrounding the DH\nwas.

And yes, I'm struck by how much the game has\nchanged...in 1973 Blyleven averaged over 8 innings per start, across 40\nstarts. But, I'm struck even more by how much Blyleven was underappreciated,\nespecially relative to his HoF contemporaries. I do remember that being the\ncase real-time. But, it's worse than you think...\n\n\n\nBlyleven's first six full seasons (1971-1976...'76 season being when he was\ntraded to Texas)...\n\n\n\nLead all major league pitchers in WAR (either flavor). Seaver was the only guy\nvery close. Guys behind him that pitched all six years and were healthy all\nsix years include: Seaver, Gaylord Perry, Sutton, Jenkins, Carlton, Blue,\nRyan, Palmer, Lolich, Phil Niekro, Hunter.\n\n\n\nSo, you don't like WAR that much (maybe especially for pitchers)? Can't blame\nyou. So,...\n\nof the 11 above names...names that ranged from really, REALLY good, to\nlegendary...\n\n\n\nFour had better ERA's than Blyleven over that stretch. One had a better FIP\n(Seaver) and two had better K/9. Seven had better WIP (Blyleven had the\nhighest BABiP). Three had more innings pitched, four had more complete games,\none had more shutouts (Palmer). None had better +WPA or WPA.\n\n\n\nBack to WAR (fwiw), but looking at career...\n\n\n\nBlyleven has the most career WAR of anyone to ever play for the Twins. Period.\n\n(Carew not all that close, Steve Carlton the closest).\n\nBlyleven ranks 7th all-time among pitchers in fWAR. All time.\n\n5th all-time among pitchers whose career began after 1907: Roger Clemens, Greg\nMaddux, Randy Johnson, and Nolan Ryan.\n\n\n\nNot bad for a guy named to exactly TWO all-star games (were we really that\nstupid back then?)...a guy that was never seriously considered for a Cy Young\naward until he'd already accumulated about 75 career WAR (were the writers\nreally that stupid back then?). Not to mention...a guy that's mocked and\nridiculed on a fairly regular basis by several in our TD community because\nhe's not their cup-of-tea as a color analyst.\n\n\n\nGregory H. Wolf, SABR -\n\n_Blyleven demanded that the Twins double his salary in 1974, leading to\ntensions with club owner Calvin Griffith, who was notoriously tight-fisted and\nthe last major-league owner who derived his income solely from the team.\nThough he received a substantial raise to a reported $55,000, Blyleven\u2019s\nrelationship with the front office was in a free-fall. Playing through\noccasional lower back pain, Blyleven split his 34 decisions, finished a\ndistant second once again to Ryan in strikeouts (249 to 367) and posted a\nstellar 2.66 ERA, but few saw him as the Twins finished last in attendance.\nGriffith rejected Kansas City\u2019s offer to buy the hurler for a million dollars,\nbut Blyleven\u2019s days with the Twins nonetheless seemed numbered._\n\n\n\nBy 1972, the Twins were irrelevant. Think 20-teen Twins without regional TV\nand playing in a cheap football stadium out in the suburbs. It seemed the\nlocal and national baseball conscious had room for one Twin...barely.

What is\noften forgotten is the fact that some of the best startups in the world solve\nthe simplest of problems.\n\nThis is exactly the approach that Pascal Henry, who is the CEO and cofounder\nof [HReasily](https://www.hreasily.com/), took when he identified the\nfundamental needs of rapidly growing SMEs\u2013to manage their human resources more\nefficiently.\n\nHenry launched his Singapore-based HR firm in late 2015 as a [Software-as-a-\nService](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/19/the-top-\nthree-2019-saas-trends-and-how-theyre-changing-it-management/#154f808c71bc)\n(SaaS) business that enables companies to increase productivity by using\ntechnology to streamline traditional processes such as payroll processing,\nleave management and expense claims.\n\n**\u201c** When I was running my first startup in Singapore, I had to do a lot of\nthe manual processes myself. I felt the pain and the drain of it,\u201d explains\nHenry. \u201cIt was taking up a lot of my time and energy, when I should have been\nfocusing on building my business.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Asia](https://www.forbes.com/asia)\n\n  * [\n\n### To Prevent Global Depression, Governments Must Act Soon\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yuwahedrickwong/2020/04/07/to-prevent-global-\ndepression-governments-must-act-soon/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Pandemic To Quicken Supply Shift From Mainland China, Benefit Taiwan R&D\n-- Amcham Taipei\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2020/04/07/pandemic-to-\naccelerate-supply-shift-from-mainland-china-benefit-taiwan-amcham-taipei/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Another Epidemic? Second Chinese Company In A Week Discloses Suspected\nFraud\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2020/04/07/another-epidemic-\nsecond-chinese-company-in-a-week-discloses-suspected-fraud/)\n\n **Improving productivity and efficiency**\n\nHReasily\u2019s mission is simple: To innovate and automate HR throughout the\nworld. As one of the fastest-growing cloud-based [HR SaaS\ncompanies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/07/18/the-hr-software-\nmarket-reinvents-itself/#e9e77df5d0af) in the region, their simple modules and\nfeatures aim to transform many of the legacy HR processes and automate them to\nbe accessible anytime and anywhere. Currently the company offers seven modules\nincluding payroll, staff leave, employee contracts and attendance. As HReasily\ngrows, it continues to add product lines aimed at empowering companies to\nscale faster.\n\nPreviously, many businesses used solutions that each looked after a particular\nsilo of an HR department. So you\u2019d have one system to manage your payroll\ncalculations, one for leave and others for other functions.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was you had to log in and out of many various systems, and\nthese systems cost a huge amount of money,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is\nbuild a solution that is very affordable that integrates with all the\nfunctions on a unified platform.\u201d\n\n**A simple but elegant business model**\n\nHReasily runs a [subscription-based revenue\nmodel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/12/whats-behind-\nthe-rise-of-the-subscription-model/#56543b1e35c3). Starting with payroll,\nwhich is at the core of every traditional HR office, the company offers\npremium versions that run on monthly or yearly subscriptions, with add-on\nmodules available such as staff leave and time attendance. This past summer at\nthe [RISE 2019 conference](https://riseconf.com/) in Hong Kong, Henry and his\nteam unveiled their latest benefits management module which will soon allow\ncustomers to acquire group level insurance, healthcare and even apply for\ncredit cards or loans.\n\nHReasily says its competitive advantage lies in its customer base, which is\nmostly SMEs. By initially focusing on the fundamental needs of this particular\nsegment, the company has earned the support of larger banking and government\nagencies and has become known as an \u201cSME champion.\u201d Not surprisingly, as the\ncompany has grown it says that it began to attract larger corporations,\npublicly listed companies, multinational corporations and even payroll\noutsourcing firms.\n\n\u201cAs we grew we acquired a more diverse customer base,\u201d Henry says, \u201cbecause a\nlot of larger companies are tired of the older and expensive solutions because\nthey need to be installed on premise and they require a refresher every year\nwhen rules and regulations change.\u201d\n\n**Partnerships are the key to rapid growth**\n\nBeing based in Singapore has allowed HReasily to capitalize on the rapid\ngrowth in[ Southeast\nAsia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vinnielauria/2019/05/14/big-upsurge-in-e-\ncommerce-drives-southeast-asias-online-economy/#77c08fc83309). SME\u2019s account\nfor 97% of all the enterprises in the region, and employ half of the\nworkforce, according to data from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\nHReasily\u2019s growth has been nothing short of impressive. With nearly 30,000\ncompanies on their platform and more than 100 new companies onboarding every\nday, HReasily is said to be growing rapidly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSome of HReasily\u2019s notable customers include Love Bonito (in Singapore,\nIndonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong), Sambat Finance (Cambodia), OnlinePajak\n(Indonesia) and TechInAsia. As the company looks to complete their coverage of\nAsia, the next major market they look to tackle is mainland China followed by\nTaiwan, Japan, Myanmar and Australia.\n\nInvestors have taken notice of the company\u2019s growth as well. Fresh off a pre-\nseries A [funding\nround](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hreasily-receives-\nus-5-million-investment-from-envy-capital-1028514742) of $5 million from Envy\nCapital, HReasily is currently estimated to be valued at more than $100\nmillion. Henry admits that the company\u2019s rapid growth in the region has only\nbeen possible with the early support from their key strategic partners.\n\nHReasily has been working with Citibank, Mazars and Stripe. The partnership\nwith [Mazars](https://www.mazars.co.th/Home/News/Mazars-in-the-press/Mazars-\ndevelops-its-digital-services-with-HReasily), which was a lead investor from\nthe startup\u2019s first round of funding, gives them access to a global audit,\nadvisory and payroll outsourcing firm with 300 offices in 100 countries. Henry\nsays it allows HReasily to localize its solutions to each individual market.\n\n**\u201c** Today, building a solid ecosystem of strategic partners is very\nimportant because you come from different angles, but you all serve one\ncustomer, which is the SME or the business,\u201d says Henry. \u201cBy coming together,\nwe collectively create a great end-to-end experience for them. There\u2019s\nstrength in numbers.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jaykimmer) or\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykimmer).

With this release, Cezanne HR\u2019s\ncustomers now benefit from the option to also track attendance, using\ntechnology they already have.\n\nEmployees can quickly and easily log when they start and finish the working\nday, either by logging on to their Cezanne HR system, or by tapping in and out\non a company tablet. Data is instantly updated in the core Cezanne HR system,\ncutting out unnecessary administration, improving accuracy and ensuring a\ncomplete history is maintained.\n\nAlongside real-time attendance tracking and reporting, customers benefit from\nthe option to define their own exception rules, such as how early or late an\nemployee can check in and out, and to set up different time plans for\ndifferent groups of employees.\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/1_27.png)\n\nJohn Hixon, Director of R&D at Cezanne HR explains: \u201cThe initial impetus for\nthis new functionality was the introduction of legislation in Spain, which\nmakes it mandatory for companies to keep a daily record of the hours employees\nwork.\n\nHowever, in talking with customers elsewhere, it quickly became clear that\nthere is a significant demand for a straightforward attendance tracking system\nthat integrates with core HR \u2013 and doesn\u2019t require expensive, specialist\nhardware or software.\n\n\u201cI am really happy with the solution our team has developed, and we\u2019re looking\nforward to working with customers to add in even more flexibility in the\nfuture\u201d.\n\n####  **Update to Public Holiday libraries**\n\nA real time-save for HR teams is the automatic, accurate calculation of\nentitlement to paid time off that is at the heart of Cezanne HR\u2019s Absence\nmodule. To make admin even more straightforward, the Absence events library in\nCezanne HR has been updated to include public holidays across key geographies\nin 2022.\n\nInstead of having to add these dates manually, HR administrators simply need\nto apply the relevant calendars to their system.\n\n####  **SMCR compliance**\n\nFrom recruitment and onboarding through performance reviews and succession\nplanning to managing conduct, culture and certification, the Senior Managers\nand Certification Regime (SMCR) adds a significant additional administrative\nburden for HR teams.\n\nCezanne HR already has many of the features needed to [support HR with SMCR\ncompliance,](https://cezannehr.com/hr-software-for-financial-services-firms/)\nand with this update we\u2019ve made sure that staff covered by either the Senior\nManagers Regime or the Certification requirements are easier to identify and\nreport on.\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/2_24.png)\n\nFull details of these and other new features added in this release, and all\nprevious updates, are available to customers in the support portal.\n\n* * *\n\n####  **About Cezanne HR**\n\nCezanne HR is a UK HR Software leader for

E-learning, also called distance learning, will run for two weeks\nuntil schools re-open on April 5, authorities had said earlier.\n\n[](https://youtu.be/iX3e1NnK3O0)\n\nSunday morning started with students logging into their school\u2019s e-learning\nsystem. Some classwork was already uploaded by teachers; in other cases,\nteachers and students interacted over video chat.\n\n### Tech-savvy students\n\nAlexandra Fatu, deputy head of senior school at GEMS World Academy in Dubai,\nsaid she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d to see all her students \u2013 in separate\nwindows \u2013 in her virtual classroom.\n\n![NAT Mrs. Alexandra Fatu\n1-1584887524913](https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2020/03/22/NAT-Mrs.-Alexandra-\nFatu-1-1584887524913_17102a86e31_original-ratio.jpg) Alexandra Fatu, deputy\nhead of senior school at GEMS World Academy in Dubai Image Credit: Supplied\n\nFatu, who teaches global politics and history to grades 11 and 12, added that\nstudents followed their normal schedule of classes and breaks. Whatever\nteaching notes she made on her screen were visible to students.\n\n\u201cStudents today know technology a lot better than we do. And thanks to our IT\nteam who had worked so hard over the spring break, there were no lags,\u201d Fatu\nsaid.\n\nAnother teacher, Jeffrey Wessel, who is deputy head of secondary school at\nSwiss International Scientific School in Dubai (SISD), said he had \u201ca very\nsuccessful conference call\u201d with 60 students from grade six.\n\n![NAT 200322 ONLINE LEARNING\nARAMZAN-2-1584887512896](https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2020/03/22/NAT-200322-ONLINE-\nLEARNING-ARAMZAN-2-1584887512896_17102a83f41_original-ratio.jpg) Online\nclasses from GEMS Modern Academy School in Dubai. Image Credit: Photo: Ahmed\nRamzan/Gulf News\n\n\u201cI asked them to all put their videos on mute to be able to listen to the\nlesson. They were requested to ask questions by using the comment box without\ndisturbing the lesson and I was able to answer their questions one by one. The\nlesson ran smoothly and they all did an excellent job transitioning to the new\nsystem,\u201d Wessel added.\n\nNayla D., a grade three student at SISD, said she completed two projects and\nuploaded her work. \u201cI wanted to do more than that; I miss school, my teachers\nand my friends. I was a bit stressed before the session started but now I\ncan\u2019t wait for day two,\u201d she added.\n\n### Teaching parents\n\nEsther Hunter, Principal, Raffles Starters and Raffles Nurseries, explained\nthe steps taken to familiarise children \u2013 and parents \u2014 with the transition.\n\n\u201cConsidering that these young students require active parent support to make\nthe most of distance learning, we went about this shift in a planned manner,\"\nHunter said.\n\n\"We first sent work home to a select few parents, with clear communication\nregarding signing in and accessing the work. Since students already knew what\nto do, this exercise was very simple. They directed their parents through the\nprocess.\n\n\"Once we got confirmation from these parents, we rolled the project out to all\nother parents. The last week before schools closed for spring break was our\ntrial period for online learning,\u201d Hunter added.\n\n![NAT  Swiss International Scientific School-\nFM-1584887507419](https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2020/03/22/NAT--Swiss-\nInternational-Scientific-School-FM-1584887507419_17102a829dc_original-\nratio.jpg) A student of Swiss International Scientific School conducting\ne-learning classes Image Credit: Supplied\n\n### Accessibility drive\n\nMany schools and officials had sent out surveys to gauge how many students had\ncomputers or smart devices, as well as internet access.\n\nA number of government departments, tele companies and philanthropists had\npromised families would be provided needed support at no cost.\n\nMichael Baty, Head of Primary, Raha International School, said: \u201cThe primary\nteam were well prepared helped by the fact that our children all have iPads\nand have been using [online learning platform] \u2018SeeSaw\u2019 for a few years now.\n\n\"The reports I am hearing from teachers is that at least 90 per cent of our\nstudents have been engaged with their teacher and class throughout the day.\u201d\n\n![NAT 200322 ONLINE LEARNING\nARAMZAN-12-1584887510172](https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2020/03/22/NAT-200322-ONLINE-\nLEARNING-ARAMZAN-12-1584887510172_17102a8349d_original-ratio.jpg) Online\nclasses from GEMS Modern Academy School in Dubai. Image Credit: Photo: Ahmed\nRamzan/Gulf News\n\n### Working from home\n\nHunter said: \u201cWe made sure that the work set for home was accessible through\nvarious devices and operating systems. The school gave out iPads and laptops\nto staff to work from home. Staff was given training on technical issues like\nconverting and editing video files, uploading files, conduct remote meetings\nand create sharable links.\u201d\n\n![NAT E learning\nSaachi-1584887523187](https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2020/03/22/NAT-E-\nlearning-Saachi-1584887523187_17102a86774_original-ratio.jpg) Suchi, of\nAmbassador School chats with her teacher Image Credit: Supplied\n\n### Students\n\nArvind Sethu, 16, Year 12 student of Jumeirah College (JC) said from a\nschedule perspective, it felt like studying in school. \u201cExcept that I had the\nliberty of not wearing a uniform and being in the comfort of my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been using different applications to log into our material. Google\nhangouts and several zoom meeting. Teachers either post a video or start a\nlive session. It just depends on how the teacher wants to go about it. For us,\nwe are given details in advance. Google hangouts. So we have zoom meetings.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/gulf_news/status/1241779674570567681)\n\nRichardt Schoonraad, a third year student in BSc Honours Psychology with Human\nResource Management, Middlesex University Dubai said: \u201cI have completed my HR\nclass through the online platform GoToMeeting where our lecturer conducted the\nseminar via a video conference.\n\n\"The session allowed us to post any questions we had regarding our latest\nassignment and lecture materials, and our lecturer fully supported us\nthroughout. I\u2019ve found the experience to be enriching and felt as though I was\npresent in the classroom even from the comfort of my own home.\u201d\n\n### Parents\n\nFrench\u2013American expat Sabine HAAS and her American husband Thomas Koenig are\nconcerned about the online platform for their children Zack and Margot Koenig.\nZack attends the SAFA community school, while their daughter, Margot attends\nLycee Fran\u00e7ais International LFI, a French school.\n\nSabine said: \u201cIn light of the current situation, and the UAE \u2013 for the good of\nits citizens and residents -is doing all the right things to ensure we are\nsafe. But I have to admit, I was apprehensive about the e-learning concept in\nthe beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cReason being, I am not a technology driven person. So for me this whole\nonline concept was a bit of a challenge. I was not sure if I could take up the\ngiant task of overseeing my two children work lessons online. Zack, 16 is in a\nBritish curriculum and Margot 13, in a French curriculum.\u201d\n\nBoth the schools sends parents up to date information on schedules, lessons,\nespecially passwords to Google classroom or Pronote apps. \u201cI turned to various\ngroups to help and support me.\n\n### So how was Day 1 of online learning?\n\nWe parents have been in touch with each other, sharing concepts and methods.\n\u201cSome of these came from the ministry of education (MOE) to help us along the\nway. We began the day with a yoga breathing session. The children did well on\nthat. There was a lot of video conferencing through various applications. Zack\nactually said: \u201cHey i could do this for a longer time. It is really cool.\n\nMy daughter said she was able to finish faster than her normal school day\nroutine and she did not have to travel in a bus for it. So all in all it was a\ngood day. aid: \u201cmom i am finished earlier now that i don\u2019t take the bus!\u2019\n\nIndian mother Pratibha Kabra said the first day of e-learning with her son\nwent rather well. Her son Tanush studies in Grade 10 of Indian High School.\n\u201cParents and students have a clear guideline mentioned. That is very helpful.\nI have not spent a lot of time with him during his online classes. He has\nlearnt to be study it independently.

HR departments can use the following criteria to help\nmake sure time-tracking processes are optimized for compliance and\nefficiency.**_\n\nIf you have hourly employees, you know how important it is to keep an accurate\nand compliant record of employee hours. On paper, this is challenging, and it\nhas traditionally created a significant administrative burden for the HR\ndepartment.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d8221ab3026a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization\u2026.\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nAs a result, more and more employers are taking their HR administration\nonline, including time and attendance tracking. But how do you know if you\nhave the right solution for your organization and whether your time-tracking\nprocesses are optimized for compliance and efficiency? In general, there are\nfive criteria that will help the HR department evaluate the best time and\nattendance system for their needs.\n\n## 1\\. Ability to clock in and out\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with time and attendance systems, it may surprise you\nthat many of them do not actually allow the employee to clock in and out\nwithin the system. Some are manual entry systems, which require employees to\nkeep their own record of how many hours they worked.\n\nThis raises some compliance concerns. Some organizations with this type of\nsystem find it incentivizes a culture of rounding up or \u201cjust clocking eight\nhours,\u201d regardless of how long employees actually work.\n\nIf there is ever a compliance audit, this puts the employer in a disadvantaged\nposition. If your organization intends to invest time and money in a system to\ntrack time compliantly, it is worth asking if this is the best type of\nplatform to accomplish that goal.\n\nAlternatively, a system that tracks the precise minute employees clock in and\nclock out keeps a better and more accurate record of hours, giving employers\nmore compliance confidence.\n\n## 2\\. Editing functionality\n\nAnyone who has worked in HR knows that tracking employee hours usually results\nin a lot of edits. Employees may forget to clock in, forget to clock out or\nforget to take a lunch break, requiring an edit to their timesheet.\n\nA nice feature to have in a time and attendance system is a prompt asking\nemployees if they need to request an edit at the moment they clock in or out.\nMany time and attendance systems don\u2019t have this ability, and employees have\nto send an email to their manager \u2013 or even leave a note on his or her desk \u2013\nto request an edit.\n\nThe result is an electronic system that requires managers to make lots of\nmanual edits, which isn\u2019t the most optimized solution.\n\nAn additional benefit of a system that manages edits natively is that the HR\ndepartment can track edit patterns. In the event that there are consistent\nissues regarding an employee\u2019s time tracking, management can address them.\n\n## 3\\. Location-based clock-in / clock-out\n\nAnother beneficial feature is a platform that restricts the ability to clock-\nin exclusively to devices getting WiFi from a certain IP address. In other\nwords, employees can only clock in or out on their device while present at the\noffice. This prevents the potential issue of early clock-in, also improving\ncompliance.\n\n## 4\\. At-a-glance in-and-out time board\n\nA visual representation of who is clocked in at any moment is important for\nmanagers, especially for larger organizations. This makes it easy to see who\nis present at a glance. __\n\n## 5\\. Payroll reporting\n\nReporting time tracking to payroll is a process with a lot of complexity. The\neasier it is to get hours worked out of the time and attendance system and\ninto payroll, the better.\n\nOne area of complexity is differentiating the types of hours worked. The time\nand attendance system need to be able to communicate how many total hours were\nworked, how many of those hours were overtime, how many were at a normal pay\nrate, and how many were paid time off hours if any.\n\nThis can be tricky to understand. To explain, let\u2019s look at an example.\n\nLet\u2019s say over a two-week pay period, Jane worked 78 hours at Acme Company.\nOvertime hours are any hours worked over 40 hours per week, per federal\nregulations. Is Jane eligible for overtime pay? Some might say no \u2013 she was\nunder 80 hours worked for the two-week period.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t accurate. You can\u2019t really tell if Jane is eligible for\novertime without a breakdown of the total hours worked.\n\nIf Jane worked 45 hours during week one, and then 33 hours during week two,\nshe would need to be compensated for five overtime hours. This is why you want\na system that can differentiate between the total 78 hours worked, the 73\nnormal pay hours, and the five overtime hours.\n\nTraditionally, figuring all of this out is a huge burden on the HR department.\nWithout a robust time and attendance system, tracking this requires\ncalculating all of these hours across multiple reports and platforms that\ndon\u2019t talk to one another.\n\nThis complexity is a big part of the reason many small and medium-sized\nemployers choose to have only salaried employees, even in circumstances where\nthat approach isn\u2019t the right fit for the organization \u2013 or even compliant\nwith federal labor laws.\n\nIn contrast, using a robust time and attendance system streamlines this\nprocess and allows employers to better optimize the structure of their\nworkforce. __Especially for organizations that are in growth mode, there is a\ntipping point where tracking hours becomes necessary and painful.\n\nDue to the complexity and compliance requirements of tracking employee hours,\nthis is an area employer are often eager to take online. Using the above\ncriteria to evaluate systems can ensure your organization finds a system that\nbest meets your needs.  \n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Ffive-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Five+Features+to+Look+for+in+a+Time+and+Attendance+System\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Five+Features+to+Look+for+in+a+Time+and+Attendance+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Ffive-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Ffive-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Ffive-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Five Features to Look for in a Time and\nAttendance\nSystem&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkforce-\nscheduling%2Ffive-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Workforce Scheduling ](/category/workforce-scheduling/\n\"Workforce Scheduling\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Key Features of Attendance Management Systems](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/attendance_management_systems_5da0835b154ee.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workforce-scheduling/features-of-attendance-management-systems/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Key Features of Attendance Management Systems\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workforce-scheduling/features-of-\nattendance-management-systems/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nLooking for a digital alternative to legacy attendance management?

Briefing\")\nReading Time: 8 minutes\n\n**_By[Allan Xu](https://www.dezshira.com/personnel/allan-xu.html), Dezan Shira\n& Associates_**\n\nGiven [Dezan Shira & Associates](http://www.dezshira.com/)' prominent position\nin China \u2013 nearly 30 years of experience, thirteen regional offices, several\nhundred staff on the ground, and our well-known China Briefing platform \u2013 we\nreceive numerous daily requests for advisory services across all sectors of\nbusiness operations in China.\n\nOur prompt and detailed [on-going tracking of the coronavirus\nsituation](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/managing-china-business-during-\ncoronavirus-outbreak-updates-advisory/) in China and our previous article on\nHR issues in China concerning current [HR issues and annual leave entitlements\ndue to the extended Lunar New Year](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/managing-hr-china-coronavirus-outbreak-clarity-work-\nresumption-leave-entitlements/) by my colleague Vivian Mao have prompted a\ndeluge of emails seeking clarification on various points.\n\nWe condense these into the frequently asked questions below so we may share\nour knowledge for free to businesses in China at this difficult time.\n\n## Questions for HR related to the coronavirus outbreak\n\n### Q1. If an employee is infected with the novel coronavirus pneumonia, does\nthe company have the right to terminate the labor relationship with the\nemployee?\n\nAccording to Article 42 of the PRC Labor Contract Law, \u201cUnder any of the\nfollowing circumstances, the employer shall not terminate a labor contract\npursuant to the provisions of Article 40 and Article 41\u2026during the stipulated\nmedical treatment period of an employee suffering from illness or non-work-\nrelated injury.\u201d\n\nArticle 40 clarifies three circumstances where the company is able to\nterminate the employee who does not commit a breach of internal rules and\npolicies. Article 41 stipulates details concerning economic redundancy.\nTherefore, if your employee is infected with the novel coronavirus pneumonia\nand he/she is either at home or in hospital, by law they are classed as being\nunder medical treatment, and the company is unable to terminate the labor\nrelationship with this employee.\n\n### Q2. If an employee\u2019s labor contract has expired during the medical\ntreatment period or quarantine, how do we deal with the labor relationship?\n\nAccording to Article 45 of the PRC Labor Contract Law, \u201cwhere a labor contract\nhas expired under any of the circumstances stipulated in Article 42, the labor\ncontract shall be extended and be terminated upon extinguishment of the\ncorresponding circumstances.\u201d This means the labor contract between the\nemployer and employee shall be extended automatically until the medical\ntreatment or quarantine is over.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the PRC issued a\nnotification on January 24, 2020 to emphasize that \u201cfor patients who are\ninfected with novel coronavirus pneumonia, suspected patients and close\ncontacts during the quarantine or medical observation period and the employees\nwho are unable to provide normal work to enterprises due to the isolation\nmeasures and emergency measures taken by the government, enterprises shall pay\nremuneration to employees during the above mentioned period, and shall not\nterminate the labor contract with employees on the basis of Article 40 and\nArticle 41 of the PRC Labor Contract Law.\n\nDuring this period, if the labor contract expires, it shall be extended to the\nexpiration of the medical treatment period, the expiration of the medical\nobservation period, the expiration of the quarantine or the termination of the\nemergency measures taken by the government.\u201d\n\n### Q3. What are employee obligations during the medical treatment period/\nobservation period/quarantine period?\n\nIf the employee has a medical certificate issued by the qualified institution\nunder above mentioned circumstances, the employee shall send the medical\ncertificate to the company for filing. If the employee does not have the\nmedical certificate, he/she shall inform company of their situation in a\ntimely manner.\n\nIf this is abused, insist a medical certificate is provided or obtain valid\nreasons why this is not forthcoming, prior to commencing disciplinary\nprocedures. Common sense applies.\n\n### Q4. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the company has suspended its\nbusiness operations. How can the company pay salaries and so on to employees\nunder these circumstances?\n\nAccording to Article 12 of Measures for the Payment of Wages by Enterprises in\nShanghai Municipality (Revision 2016), \u201cwhere an enterprise suspends business\nor operation during a wage payment cycle, it shall pay wages to its workers\npursuant to the agreement. Where the suspension exceeds a wage payment cycle,\nthe enterprise may pay wages to its workers based on the new agreement between\nboth parties in accordance with work rendered by the workers, but the wages\nshall not be less than the minimum wage standard stipulated by the\nMunicipality.\u201d\n\nSome other cities also follow Shanghai\u2019s legislative spirit to pay wages to\nemployees during the business suspension period, such as Xiamen. In other\nprovinces, such as Jiangsu and Guangdong, the same rule is applicable where\nthe suspension happens within a wage payment cycle. However, where the\nsuspension exceeds a wage payment cycle and company is unable to arrange\nemployees to work or employees are unable to provide normal work to company,\nliving expenses shall be paid to employees, which shall not be less than 80\npercent of the minimum wage standard.  \nThe local policy in different cities may differ, so please check and follow\nthe local requirements. Your China advisers should be able to assist, if not\nplease contact us at **[HR@dezshira.com](mailto:HR@dezshira.com)** for\nclarification.\n\n### Q5. If an employee has traveled to Wuhan or other cities in Hubei\nrecently, is it possible to ask the employee to isolate himself/herself at\nhome for several days before resuming work? How to do that in compliance with\nthe law?\n\nAccording to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and\nTreatment of Infectious Diseases (Revision 2013), infectious diseases governed\nby this Law are divided into Classes A, B, and C.\n\nBased on the latest announcement issued by the National Health Commission of\nPRC, novel coronavirus pneumonia has been treated as an infectious disease\nunder Class B, but the measures for Class A shall be taken. The medical\nagencies shall keep the persons in close contact with the patients, pathogen\ncarriers, or suspected patients in medical agencies under medical observation\nat designated places and to take other necessary preventive measures.\n\nAlthough there is no specific rule to define whether enterprises are able to\nrequest employees to isolate himself/herself at home for a certain period\nbefore resuming work, it is recommended for businesses to take the necessary\nmeasures to prevent the spread of epidemic in this way.\n\nCompanies can follow the recommendations below to ask that employees isolate\nthemselves for a certain period at home before resuming work:\n\n  1. Define the scope of work of the employees who need to be isolated at home;\n  2. We recommend discussing with affected employees about the isolation period, wages, or living expenses during this period, etc.;\n  3. If agreement is unable to be reached between the company and the employee, the company is able to request the employee to work from home \u2013 based on the legislative spirit of relevant laws and the wage shall be paid to employee as if they were in normal attendance; and\n  4. If the employee refuses to be isolated and work from home, the company may report this to the relevant administrative organization to seek assistance on compulsory isolation.\n\n### Q6. If employees refuse to cooperate with the company during the extended\nholiday or isolation period, what should the company do?\n\nShould employees refuse to cooperate with the company, for example, in\nproviding support to clients, it is not suggested to give immediate\ndisciplinary punishment as this can lead to arguments. Some suggestions on\nhandling this have been given in our article \u201c[Managing HR in China during the\nCoronavirus Outbreak](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/managing-hr-china-\ncoronavirus-outbreak-clarity-work-resumption-leave-entitlements/)\u201d.\n\nInstead, this situation should have been preempted, as every company in China\nhas the autonomy to define its own performance review system. The performance\nreview system should be designed and implemented by the HR department based on\nthe nature of business and the position. Reviews can be conducted monthly,\nquarterly, and/or annually.\n\nNormally a performance review and related stipulations shall be included in\nlabor contract, employee handbook/bylaws, or specific regulation within the\ncompany. Providing that the employees refused to cooperate with company during\nabove mentioned period, the company shall discuss with employees the\nsituation. If both parties are unable to reach an amicable agreement, the\nemployees\u2019 performance may be reviewed according to companies\u2019 internal rules\nand policies.\n\nHaving a Performance Review System should be an integral part of any Foreign-\nInvested Companies HR policy, and these should be contained within the company\nEmployee Handbook. Please see this article for further advise: [Avoiding Labor\nDisputes in China: The Importance of the Employee Handbook](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/importance-staff-handbook/).\n\nIf you need assistance with drafting an Employee Handbook, please contact us\nat **[HR@dezshira.com](mailto:HR@dezshira.com)**.\n\n### Q7. Since the central government announced the Spring Festival Holiday\nshall be extended and local municipal governments also issued notifications to\ndetermine the date of resuming work respectively, if the employee already\napplied for annual leave during what is now an extended period, how does the\ncompany classify this leave?\n\nOur understanding is that the cornonavirus is an unexpected emergency. If the\nemployee had already applied for annual leave prior to the announcement of the\nholiday extension, we recommend dealing with this situation on the principle\nof benefiting the employee.\n\nIn Shanghai, since the extended holiday shall be treated as weekly rest day,\nit is preferable to allow the employee to withdraw the annual leave\napplication and enjoy the extended holiday following the local municipal\ngovernment\u2019s announcement. In Beijing, since the local municipal government\nencourages the employees to take annual leaves during this period, it is not\nnecessary to allow the employee to withdraw the annual leave application\nduring this period. The local situation can vary. Please check for regional\ndifferences or email us at **[HR@dezshira.com](mailto:HR@dezshira.com)** for\nclarification or advise.\n\n### Q8. If my company is registered in Shanghai and it has subsidiaries in\nother cities, which policy shall be applicable to local employees?\n\nIf the company has employees based in different cities, local employees shall\nfollow their local policies of working place related to extended holiday, time\nof resuming work, remuneration, etc.\n\n### Q9. If the company needs to resume work before February 10, how does it\napply for approval?\n\nBased on the announcement issued by the Shanghai municipal government on\nJanuary 28, a special approval and filing system shall be established for\nearly work resumption in Shanghai. If it is necessary to resume operation\nbefore February 10 due to specific reasons, the company shall provide relevant\nmaterials, including information of foreign employee registrations, an\nepidemic outbreak response plan and measures, a statement of \"Negative\nOutbreak\" to the headquarters of epidemic prevention and controlling of\ntown/street or industry park for approval.\n\nOnce approval is issued, the company can resume operations and the approval\nshall be submitted to headquarters of epidemic prevention and controlling at\ndistrict level for record. In case of non-compliance the company shall be\nimmediately ordered to stop production and shall be held accountable pursuant\nto local laws and regulations. This could involve being fined or having the\nbusiness license revoked.\n\n**Revised Lunar New Year Holiday Schedules:**\n\n  * 24 provinces and cities in China have announced a further extension of the current Lunar New Year holiday. These are \u2013 Anhui, Chongqing, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanghai, Shanxi, Suzhou, Xi\u2019an, Yunnan, and Zhejiang; all have stated that non-essential businesses need not re-commence their operations until **next Monday, February 10.**\n  * Hubei province, where Wuhan is located and is the center of the Coronavirus outbreak, has stated that the holiday period will last until at least **February 14.**\n  * Beijing has stated that companies should let employees work from home from now until **February 9** , while Tianjin has urged companies to not resume operations until further notice.\n\n\n\n_[Allan Xu](https://www.dezshira.com/personnel/allan-xu.html) is a member of\nDezan Shira & Associates [Business\nAdvisory](https://www.dezshira.com/services/business-advisory) team in\n[Shanghai](https://www.dezshira.com/office/china/shanghai.html).

There are multiple advantages to\nstreamlining your HR functions:\n\n**Saves money and time:** The conventional way of implementing HR-related\ntasks, which relies completely on human efforts, consumes a lot of time and\ncalls for a large amount of money. A feature-packed payroll software system,\non the other hand, allows you to set up automated alerts to notify you\nwhenever it identifies any discrepancies. A sophisticated payroll software\nplatform not only helps save tremendous amounts of time over manual payroll\nprocesses but also eliminates human errors rampant in the manual process of\ndata entry or data collection.\n\n**Simplifies wage calculation:** Payroll software solutions replace monotonous\npayroll processes, such as writing checks by hand, calculating different types\nof payments and perusing spreadsheets. Automated payroll software is capable\nof calculating all types of payments, including bonuses, commissions and wage\ndeductions, among others. What's more, it also saves time by generating\npaychecks automatically. However, you should keep in mind that these processes\nare not completely error-free as the accuracy of the generated results relies\non the accuracy of the input.\n\n **Facilitates easy financial planning:** An automated payroll software\ntransfers funds into the payroll account immediately. Since your employees are\nnotified as soon as their paycheck gets deposited to their account, it\neliminates the need for visiting banks. Automated payroll software also\nminimizes the chances of delayed paychecks that weakens the trust of your\nemployees and may also lead to penalties.\n\n **Generates employee satisfaction:** Satisfied employees are crucial for the\nsuccess of your business and are more productive and engaged. For example,\nautomated [_attendance management\nsoftware_](https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/attendance-management-software)\nmaximizes employee productivity by making sure that leaves and other\nprivileges are properly dispensed. If a manager is unaware when employees are\napplying for PTO, poor leave planning will not only put his/her workforce\nplanning at risk, but will also end up creating manpower shortages on days\nwhen the company is understaffed, thus, overburdening employees and making\nthem dissatisfied.\n\nThe best attendance management software is the one that can be customized as\nper the modification of your business policies. For example, attendance\nmanagement software should allow you to include the different holidays your\ncompany wants to add in addition to the existing official holidays.\n\n **Facilitates accurate timekeeping:** Conventional payroll processes call for\ncalculating hourly wages manually, which is again a time-consuming affair.\nAutomated payroll software can be linked to timesheet systems for recording\nemployee attendance, as well as the total time worked. It automatically\ntransfers data about total hours worked by employees into your payroll system,\nthus simplifying your payroll calculations. It is also capable of making\nnecessary edits when an employee forgets to clock in or out.\n\n **Simplifies tax deduction calculation by minimizing errors:** Tax rules and\nregulations keep changing frequently. Automated payroll software is designed\nto seamlessly calculate taxes for each employee. Consequently, it minimizes\nerrors and saves you from penalties.\n\n **Facilitates easy recordkeeping:** With an automated payroll system, you can\neliminate the need for maintaining tax records manually. Besides generating\nbackups automatically, payroll software is also capable of storing payroll\ndata and employment tax, thus helping you save time and effort.\n\n **Make changes instantaneously:** Manual payroll modifications, such as\nadding new employee data to the system or adding or correcting employees' bank\naccount details, requires your employees to fill up multiple paper forms. With\nautomated payroll software, you can make modifications directly in the system.\nSome payroll platforms allow these changes to be made by the employer as well\nas the employees.\n\n **Maintain consistency across departments:** High-performing payroll software\nhelps you maintain consistency in different departments, thus, keeping\neveryone on the same page. Furthermore, having a centralised HR management\nsoftware keeps employees from different departments updated on your latest HR\npolicies without having to touch base with other offices individually.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of automating payroll processes is the absence\nof in-house payroll skills, compelling organizations to count on payroll\noutsourcing tailored to fit their business. Therefore, before taking the final\nplunge, you need to prepare by upgrading your skills and capabilities for this\nlarge-scale transformation.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f54321/2147483647/strip/true/crop/200x200+0+29/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe9%2F27%2F774fa2134473966449f93e78950a%2Funnamed.png)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/kiran-bajpai)\n\n[Kiran

[According to the World Health\nOrganization](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\n\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\"),\nas of March 20, 2020, there are 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 168\nterritories and countries. According to Johns Hopkins, the United States [has\n14,250 confirmed\ncases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\")\nwith reported cases in every state.\n\nAs a result of the virus, state, local, and federal government officials have\ninstituted varying degrees of voluntary and mandatory quarantines. The impact\nhas been felt immediately by businesses.\n\nIn response, Congress has proposed several bills, including the most recent\none introduced by Senate Republican leadership and dubbed the \"Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\" or the \"CARES Act.\"  Here are some of\nthe highlights:\n\nToday In: [Taxes](https://www.forbes.com/taxes)\n\n  * [\n\n### Ask Larry: Will My Social Security Benefits Be Reduced If I Earn $12,000\nThis Year?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/07/ask-larry-will-my-social-\nsecurity-benefits-be-reduced-if-i-earn-12000-this-year/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Free Money For Small Business? Beware Legal Risks Of Paycheck Protection\nLoan Program Until More Guidance Issued\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebrumberg/2020/04/06/free-money-for-small-\nbusiness-beware-legal-risks-of-paycheck-protection-loan-program-until-more-\nguidance-issued/)\n\n  * [\n\n### COVID-19 Could Bankrupt Your State\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2020/04/06/covid-19-could-\nbankrupt-your-state/)\n\n **Stimulus Checks.**  The bill would provide checks called \"recovery rebates\"\nto taxpayers. Unlike rebate checks in the past, which tended to be flat per\ntaxpayer or family, the current bill would vary according to family income.\nThe bill would allow for checks of up to $1,200 per adult - or $2,400 for\nmarried couples filing jointly - as well as $500 per child. All taxpayers must\nprovide a Social Security number or adoption taxpayer identification number.\n\nAnd here's where things get tricky: taxpayers must typically be working or\nreceiving Social Security or pension income to qualify since the amounts are\ntied to tax returns. The amount of the checks would start to phaseout for\nthose earning more than $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns) and would\ndisappear entirely for those earning more than $99,000. Those families at the\nbottom - those with no federal income tax liability - would receive less\nmoney, but no less than $600. Checks would be paid out \"as rapidly as\npossible.\"\n\nAnd since I know many folks have asked: under the bill as written, checks\nwould not be subject to reduction or offset.\n\n**Filing Deadlines.**  The bill would push off the filing (yes, FILING)\ndeadline for individual 2019 tax returns to July 15, 2020 - but that is moot\nsince the filing deadline was [officially\nextended](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/20/irs-pushes-\nfiling-and-payment-deadlines-to-july-15/#4aba9b5f23e2\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/20/irs-pushes-filing-\nand-payment-deadlines-to-july-15/#4aba9b5f23e2\") on March 20, 2020. However,\nthe bill would also extend the due date for estimated payments for 2020 to\nOctober 15, 2020, and would treat ALL estimated payments due through October\n15, 2020, as \"one installment due on such date.\" In other words, there would\nbe no need to write separate checks for the skipped April and July estimated\npayment dates if the proposal passes.\n\n**Small Business Interruption Loans.  **The bill would expand the eligibility\nfor certain small businesses (those under 500 employees) to receive a loan of\nup to $10 million under the Small Business Act. Loans could be used for\npayroll support, including paid sick, medical, or family leave, and costs\nrelated to the continuation of group health care benefits; employee salaries;\nmortgage payments and rent; utilities; and other debts. Loans used to cover\npayroll could be forgiven if businesses retain employees through June 30,\n2020. Funds used to pay tipped employees, such as bars and restaurants, may be\neligible for loan forgiveness if they are used to provide additional wages.\n\n**Special Rules for Retirement Accounts.**  The bill would allow for tax-\nfavored \"coronavirus-related\" distributions from certain retirement plans of\nup to $100,000. Qualifying taxpayers would also be allowed to repay their\nretirement plans to make up for money withdrawn to pay coronavirus-related\nexpenses (including loans and distributions).\n\n**Charitable Contributions Move Above The Line.  **In what I think might be a\nfirst, the bill would provide that certain charitable contributions be treated\nas above-the-line. That means that you would not have to itemize to claim\nthose deductions - something that [many taxpayers have grappled\nwith](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/11/14/the-gifts-that-\nkeep-on-giving-5-strategies-to-tax-optimize-charitable-giving/#449b732c26fe\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/11/14/the-gifts-that-keep-\non-giving-5-strategies-to-tax-optimize-charitable-giving/#449b732c26fe\")\nbecause of the increased standard deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(TCJA) that took effect in 2018. Under the provisions in the bill, the benefit\ncouldn't exceed $300 and wouldn't apply to donor-advised funds.\n\n**Charitable Contribution Limits.**  The bill would also temporarily suspend\nthe limits under section 170(b) and (d) on cash donations for individuals and\nmodifies limits for charitable contributions from corporations. Restrictions\napply (of course).\n\n**Corporate Tax Payment Delays.**  Corporations get extra time to file and\npay, too. The bill would extend the time to pay estimated payments (same\ntreatment as individuals) and payroll taxes through October 15, 2020. And yes,\nthe extension for payroll tax would apply to the employer portion of self-\nemployment taxes, too.\n\n**Net Operating Losses.**  Taxpayers and tax professionals weren't big fans of\nthe TCJA provision limiting net operating losses. Those provisions would be\nmodified under the bill, allowing for carry-forwards and carry-backs (!) to\n2018. Lots (and lots) of limitations and restrictions would apply.\n\n**Bailouts.**  The bill includes up to $208,000,000,0000 for loans and loan\nguarantees to severely distressed sectors of the economy. Those sectors\ninclude passenger and cargo air carriers and \"other eligible businesses.\"\nLimits apply, including restrictions on paying certain highly-compensated\nemployees.\n\n**Aviation Excise Taxes.**  Travelers could get a break, too. The bill would\nsuspend certain federal aviation excise taxes through the end of the year. You\nmay not write a separate check for those taxes, but you do pay them - just\ncheck your tickets.\n\n**COVID-19 Testing and Treatment.  **With costs for testing and treatment\nstill a concern, the bill would require group health plans and health\ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance to cover\npreventive services for the virus. It would also require diagnostic test\nproviders for COVID-19 to make the cash price for the test available to the\npublic on the internet.\n\n**Inclusion of Certain Over-The-Counter Medical Products As Qualified Medical\nExpenses.**  As a woman, I cheer this provision, but as a tax professional,\nI'm perplexed by the timing. The bill would consider amounts paid for\nmenstrual care products as paid for medical care. That would include \"a\ntampon, pad, liner, cup, sponge, or similar product used by individuals with\nrespect to menstruation or other genital-tract secretions.\" You already know\nhow I feel about this, I'm sure (you can read [my tampon-hoarding piece\nhere](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/02/13/lawmakers-\nworry-that-sales-tax-exemption-means-women-will-buy-too-many-\ntampons/#6f5f4ab6f93c\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/02/13/lawmakers-worry-\nthat-sales-tax-exemption-means-women-will-buy-too-many-\ntampons/#6f5f4ab6f93c\")), because we are certainly not buying menstrual\nproducts for kicks - it's a medical thing - but the inclusion in *this* bill\nis odd. But, here we are, so I'm not complaining. The bill would extend the\nqualifying medical expenses treatment for menstrual products to Archer Medical\nSavings Accounts, Health Flexible Spending Arrangements, Health Reimbursement\nArrangement - your basic healthcare alphabet soup: MSAs, HSAs, HRAs and the\nlike.\n\n**Current Students.  **I know many of you scrolled down just to read this bit\n(do yourself a favor and scroll back up, just in case), but several provisions\nin the bill apply to student loans. And honestly, they're the most complicated\n(yes, more than airline bailout provisions). But here's the gist. First,\ncolleges and universities are allowed to award \"emergency financial aid\ngrants\" without regard to the usual need calculation; the amount of the grant\ncan't exceed the applicable Pell grant for the same year. The bill would also\nallow some payments to be made to students with work-study arrangements if\nthey weren't able to finish their work during the year because of the virus\n(including virus-related closings).\n\nThe bill also allows the Department of Education to exclude some loans for\nstudents who were unable to remain enrolled in school as a result of a\nqualifying emergency (exceptions apply). Waivers also apply to Pell Grant\nrepayments under the same circumstances. The details will probably have to be\nfinessed, but this is clearly intended for students who were forced to\nwithdraw and did not receive credit for attendance but paid unreimbursed\ntuition and expenses with loans.\n\n**Suspension Of Student Loans.**  The bill also provides that payments due for\nstudent loans shall be suspended - without interest - for three months.\n\n**Corrections and Modifications.**  The bill also offers revisions and\nmodifications to existing paid leave bills, including the Family and Medical\nLeave Act and the spanking new Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\nWAIT! Before you run out and share, keep in mind that this is just a bill -\nand it's my first read of the bill. It's long and dense. Senate Finance\nCommittee Chair Charles Grassley (R-IA) said, \"These recommendations take bold\nsteps to curb the economic fallout as we work as a country to contain this\npandemic. These recommendations won't be the end of the congressional response\nto the coronavirus.\"\n\nBut some in Congress worry that the bill offers a lot, but is not focused on\nassisting those who need it most. Even Republicans voiced skepticism about the\nMcConnell-introduced plan. Two Senators, in particular, suggested that the\ntiming is off. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) isn't yet on board, saying that the\nchecks won't do much to help at this point; Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.)\nreportedly agrees.\n\nYou can read the [latest version of the bill\nhere](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3548/BILLS-116s3548is.pdf\n\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3548/BILLS-116s3548is.pdf\") \\- but settle\nin - it's 247 pages long.\n\nThis bill is in addition to H.R. 6201,  _Families First Coronavirus Response\nAct,_  which cleared the House last week and [passed in the\nSenate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/18/senate-\npasses-houses-coronavirus-relief-bill-president-expected-to-sign/#561b173635a8\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/18/senate-passes-\nhouses-coronavirus-relief-bill-president-expected-to-sign/#561b173635a8\") this\nweek. It guarantees free testing or health care coverage for coronavirus\ntesting, and provides paid sick leave for some workers and offers additional\nfunding for seniors, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. You can read\nmore about the highlights of the bill in our prior coverage\n[here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/14/house-bill-\nwould-allow-for-paid-leave-testing--tax-credits-to-lessen-impact-of-\ncoronavirus/#14fc94d35207\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/14/house-bill-would-\nallow-for-paid-leave-testing--tax-credits-to-lessen-impact-of-\ncoronavirus/#14fc94d35207\"). The President signed the bill into law on\nWednesday, March 18, 2020.\n\nIt's also in addition to the $8.3 billion emergency health package, which was\npassed earlier this month. This most recent bill focuses explicitly on\neconomic aid for workers.\n\nClearly, things are happening at a rapid-fire pace these days.

It was a horrible experience. In a desperate\nattempt to avoid anything like that in the future, I enrolled in a tax course.\nI loved it. I signed up for another. Before I knew it, in addition to my JD, I\nearned an LL.M Taxation. While at law school, I interned at the estates\nattorney division of the IRS. At IRS, I participated in the review and audit\nof federal estate tax returns. At one such audit, opposing counsel read my\nreport, looked at his file and said, \"Gentlemen, she\u2019s exactly right.\" I\nnearly fainted. It was a short jump from there to practicing, teaching,\nwriting and breathing tax.

Likewise, the Delhi government private companies and municipal\ncorporations to stop using biometric attendance systems, according to the\n[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-\nnation/delhi-govt-advises-hods-autonomous-bodies-municipal-corporations-to-\nsuspend-biometric-attendance/articleshow/74492948.cms).\n\nBut can facial recognition replace fingerprint identification if people are\nwearing masks?\n\nChinese company [Wisesoft](http://www.wisesoft.com.cn/) says it has developed\na 3D facial recognition system in partnership with a research team from\nSichuan University that can identify people wearing masks with 98 percent\naccuracy and collect body temperature, reports [China\nDaily](http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202003/04/WS5e5f720da31012821727c4ee.html).\n\nA hospital in Chengdu has deployed 140 units of the product already, and\nWisesoft says it plans to produce 1,000 more units over the next two months.\n\nOther companies, including\n[SenseTime](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202002/sensetime-develops-\nbiometric-identification-system-for-masked-faces-as-chinese-companies-adapt-\nto-crisis) and [Telpo](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202002/telpo-launches-\ncontactless-facial-biometric-thermometer-solution-for-disease-control) also\nclaim to have developed facial biometric technology that works despite masks\npartially occluding the faces of subjects.\n\nConstant surveillance in the name of outbreak containment presents a risk of\nnormalizing pervasive state surveillance, digital rights experts are warning.\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tech-\ntrfn/coronavirus-controls-increase-surveillance-danger-idUSKBN20S0GJ)\ninterviewed several experts in big data, governance, and digital rights. They\nexpress concern that the appropriate mechanisms for preventing emergency\nmeasures from being repurposed for political and social control are not\npresent in some countries.\n\nAccess Now Asia Policy Director Raman Jit Singh Chima says the use of facial\nrecognition for specific purposes at airports may be justified, but indefinite\nstorage of health, travel, and other data is illegitimate.\n\nAn international conference in Singapore contributed significantly to the\nspread of the coronavirus, and the country has implemented contact tracking,\nwith detailed logs of people\u2019s movements and interactions, in order to find\nundiagnosed cases and carry out preventative quarantine procedures. China and\n[Russia](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202002/moscow-rolls-out-biometric-\nfacial-recognition-to-monitor-coronavirus-infections) have also implemented\nstrict controls over personal movement.\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * [![fingerprint](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/25134809/fingerprint-large-150x150.jpg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/mumbai-introduces-biometric-attendance-system-for-hiv-patients)\n\n[Mumbai introduces biometric attendance system for HIV\npatients](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/mumbai-introduces-biometric-\nattendance-system-for-hiv-patients)\n\n  * [![iphone-3D-depth-sensing-cameras](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28154830/iphone-3D-depth-sensing-cameras-150x150.jpg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201908/analyst-says-2021-iphones-to-feature-in-display-fingerprint-biometrics-and-face-id)\n\n[Analyst says 2021 iPhones to feature in-display fingerprint biometrics and\nFace ID](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201908/analyst-says-2021-iphones-to-\nfeature-in-display-fingerprint-biometrics-and-face-id)\n\n  * [![fingerprint](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/25134809/fingerprint-large-150x150.jpg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201912/idemia-biometric-algorithm-generates-thousands-of-leads-as-fingerprint-examiner-tests-questioned)\n\n[Idemia biometric algorithm generates thousands of leads as fingerprint\nexaminer tests questioned](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201912/idemia-\nbiometric-algorithm-generates-thousands-of-leads-as-fingerprint-examiner-\ntests-questioned)\n\n  * [![Biometric hardware revenues forecast to hit $19B by 2024 on access control and camera growth](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15124528/Telpo-TPS980-face-recognition-machine-150x150.jpg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201908/telpo-targets-biometric-access-control-market-with-facial-recognition-terminal)\n\n[Telpo targets biometric access control market with facial recognition\nterminal](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201908/telpo-targets-biometric-\naccess-control-market-with-facial-recognition-terminal)\n\n  * [![Biometric facial recognition to verify dates, gamblers, car rentals, voters, and online exams](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/04160101/facial-recognition-for-biometric-access-control-housing-150x150.jpeg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/india-authorizes-roll-out-of-automated-biometric-facial-recognition-in-police-investigations)\n\n[India authorizes roll out of automated biometric facial recognition in police\ninvestigations](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/india-authorizes-roll-\nout-of-automated-biometric-facial-recognition-in-police-investigations)\n\n  * [![Fingerprint-Identification](https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/15150741/Automated-Fingerprint-Identification-System-AFIS-150x150.jpg)](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/fingerprint-cards-adds-capacitive-touch-sensors-to-biometric-access-control-portfolio)\n\n[Fingerprint Cards adds capacitive touch sensors to biometric access control\nportfolio](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202001/fingerprint-cards-adds-\ncapacitive-touch-sensors-to-biometric-access-control-portfolio)\n\n## Article Topics\n\n[access control](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/access-control)  |\n[biometrics](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/biometrics)  |\n[contactless](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/contactless)  |  [facial\nrecognition](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/facial-recognition)  |\n[fingerprint recognition](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/fingerprint-\nrecognition-2)  |  [India](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/india)  |\n[time and attendance](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/time-and-attendance)\n|  [video surveillance](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/video-\nsurveillance)  |  [Wisesoft](https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/wisesoft)\n\n## Comments\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/202003/fingerprint-biometric-attendance-\nsystems-suspended-in-india-as-impacts-of-coronavirus-considered#respond)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Will it change conservative corporate culture?\n\n![Author\nimage](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/960_540/images/live/p0/7f/sc/p07fsc3b.jpg)\n\n### By Lu-Hai Liang\n\n9th March 2020\n\nT\n\nTao Yu usually works in a stylish office in Shanghai, China's major financial\nhub, as a member of German automaker Porsche's marketing department. But since\nthe Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak the 28-year-old, like tens of millions of\nher compatriots, has been forced to work from home.\n\nTao is from Hubei, the southern province where the virus originated, and she\nis working from her family home in Huanggang, a city of 7.5 million people. It\nis the second most affected city, after Wuhan. \"I get up, have breakfast, come\nto my room and start working,\" she says.\n\nTao is not a fan of working from home, but it's what many of her neighbours\nare doing as the city is in lockdown. She worries about what her colleagues\nthink of her. \"I want to show that working at home and in the office is the\nsame, but I'm worried my colleagues will think it's not fair. They might think\nworking from home is luxurious,\" she explains.\n\n> ## Since 3 February, millions of Chinese have been experiencing the pros and\n> cons of the home office for the first time\n\nIn China, working from home is much less common than in the West. But since 3\nFebruary, when local governments and companies across the nation encouraged\nworkers to stay at home, millions of Chinese have been experiencing the pros\nand cons of the home office for the first time.\n\nWith normally busy streets in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and\nGuangzhou eerily quiet, this mass experiment in working from home has led to a\nsurge in demand for video-conferencing apps such as Tencent's WeChat Work and\nAlibaba-owned DingTalk. US company Zoom, another video-conferencing provider,\nhas seen its stocks rise, counter to overall trends as coronavirus fears drag\ndown the market.\n\nChinese workers have had mixed reactions to the experiment. Some complain of\nintrusive bosses who cannot believe their employees can be trusted to work\nfrom home; some are distracted by family members or find it difficult to\nfocus, while others are embracing the experience, enjoying improved\nproductivity; some even report improved love lives.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862fs0.jpg)\n\nWorkers queue to enter a Shanghai office on February 10 after an extended\nholiday to slow the spread of the virus. Now, many such employees work\nremotely (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n **' Forced to adapt'**\n\nSun Meng, 32, from Liaoning province, works in Beijing as a curriculum planner\nand designer for online education company VIPKid. She's been working from home\nfor a month - and doesn't miss the long trek to and from the office. \"It feels\ngreat, because normally I commute four hours there and back to work,\" she\nexplains.  \n\nShe can't move closer to work because her husband's hukou (a household\nregistration system that grants access to welfare facilities) means her three-\nyear-old son is tied to their local kindergarten. \"It's a public kindergarten\n- the only one he can go to. If he were to go to a closer one [to her office],\nwe'd have to go private and it's too expensive.\"\n\n> ## At the office, people have to clock in and out, but now they start their\n> day by sending a \u2018check-in\u2019 photo to a DingTalk group\n\nSun has applied unsuccessfully in the past to work from home two days a week\n(the company instead allowed her to shift her working hours). But since staff\nhave been forced to work from home Sun says her CEO has admitted workers are\nbeing more efficient. And internal ways of working have also changed to\naccommodate the new normal. At the office, people have to clock in and out,\nbut now they start their day by sending a \"check-in\" photo to a DingTalk group\nand fill in daily work reports through one of the platform's apps. \"Now we are\nforced to work from home, they [HR] are forced to adapt how they monitor,\" she\nsays.\n\nThe best thing about home working, Sun says, is that her son doesn't have to\nwait until late in the evening to see her. \"I can close my laptop immediately\n[after work] and start playing with him.\"\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862frl.jpg)\n\nDemand has also surged for DingTalk, which makes intelligent conference\nsystems and other tools for remote workers (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n **' Makes things harder'**\n\nIt's not clear exactly what proportion of the workforce was allowed to\ntelecommute before Covid-19 emerged. Fifty-one percent of businesses in China\nsay they have a flexible workspace policy, according to the [2019 IWG Global\nWorkspace Survey](http://assets.regus.com/pdfs/iwg-workplace-survey/iwg-\nworkplace-survey-2019.pdf); the corresponding figure for the US is 69%. Yet\nflexibility is defined differently by different organisations: to some it can\nmean simply the ability to control your hours or manage your own workload.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that Chinese workers use (or are allowed to use)\nhome working considerably less than the US, for example, where figures from\nGallup showed that by 2017 [43% of\nworkers](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/206033/america-coming-\nworkplace-home-alone.aspx) worked remotely at least some of the time.  \n\nJay Milliken, senior partner and Asia regional lead for consultancy Prophet,\nbelieves China's lower home working rate is linked to traditional workplace\nculture. \"The organisational culture of Chinese companies overall still has a\nlong way to go - with creative agencies and tech start-ups being exceptions,\"\nhe says. Many Chinese companies still adopt a highly top-down management\nstyle, with requirements such as their employees punch in and out for work,\nand their bonus and KPIs tied closely to attendance. \"The 'work-from-home'\nstyle goes against their belief of how employees should be managed,\" says\nMilliken.\n\n> ## Working from home made administration harder, due to less efficient\n> communication and employees slacking off at work doing personal things \u2013 Xin\n> Sun\n\nXin Sun, 36, a manager at Pingan Bank in Shenzhen, certainly feels he has less\ncontrol over his employees when they're not in the office. \"Working from home\nmade administration harder, due to less efficient communication and employees\nslacking off at work doing personal things,\" he says. \"When working from home,\nmy team members sometimes respond to me late, which makes me feel out of\ncontrol. Usually we have weekly meetings, but during the work-from-home\nperiod, I host daily meetings, just to make sure everyone is on the same page\nand has something to work on every day. Also, I've asked them to report to me\nevery day what they've done and what they plan to do tomorrow. I find it an\neffective way to motivate them and not fall behind,\" he says.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862fqd.jpg)\n\nUniversities have taken measures to limit exposure by switching to online\nclasses conducted by video conference (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBut requirements to check in more with managers are hitting some employees\nhard. Yang, 23, a producer at Chinese games company NetEase, says she now has\nmore conference calls each day, cutting into the time available to do her\nwork. \"Before the outbreak happened when I was at the workplace, it was not\nmandatory to report deliverables every day, but now everything you've done\nshould be carefully recorded in daily reports and sent to the boss. I'm afraid\nthat it reduces my efficiency,\" says Yang, who chose to use only one name.\n\n**Here to stay?**\n\nAlthough Chinese work culture might be more conservative, in technological\nterms it is well set up for working from home. WeChat - a [super\napp](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190719-super-apps) that combines\nmessaging, file transfer, video-conferencing capabilities, e-payment and other\nfunctions - is ubiquitous, with over a billion users in China. Matthew\nBrennan, who is writing a book about WeChat, says that for many small and\nmedium-sized enterprises using WeChat is the obvious option, given it takes\nthe place of apps like Slack (which is sometimes blocked in China) or email.\n\nAnd in many cases, working from home would help employers hit by [sky-high\noffice rental rates](https://www.theinvestor.jll/news/china/office/whats-\ndriving-chinas-high-office-rents/) and employees suffering from long commutes.\nYet it is hard to tell whether this enforced period of home working will lead\nto the practice becoming more widespread in China in the long-term.\n\n> ## People often feel stressed out, both mentally and physically. Now many\n> have tried working from home and have found it's a way of balancing work and\n> life, I believe there will be more demand \u2013 Qun Li\n\nQun Li, associate professor of enterprise culture at Beijing Jiaotong\nUniversity, believes demand from employees will certainly increase. \"They have\nlimited time spent with their families, taking care of kids or accompanying\ntheir parents. They also have difficulty coping with their personal well-\nbeing. Since working and commuting occupy almost their entire schedule, people\noften feel stressed out both mentally and physically. Now many have tried\nworking from home and have found it's a way of balancing work and life, I\nbelieve there will be more demand,\" he says.\n\nBut whether employees get what they want will depend on the type of work they\ndo and how team-oriented it is, he adds. Industries such as media and tech\nallow more flexible schedules and a higher possibility of granting permission\nto work from home. \"But traditional industries that need workers on site -\ninvolving production lines, high demand for team co-ordination - will still be\naverse to home working,\" he says.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862frk.jpg)\n\nWith more than a billion users, WeChat is a dominant super app. Demand for\nWeChat Work, its enterprise product, has surged in recent weeks (Credit: Getty\nImages)\n\nZhang Xiaomeng, associate professor of organisational behaviour at the Cheung\nKong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, points out that many companies\nhave invested in online office platforms and related training during this\nperiod, which will make them more likely to use such features in the future.\nAttitudes are changing too, she says. \"I think this 'autocratic' management\napproach is getting less popular, and more managers are caring more about\nemployees' needs.\n\n\"The Covid-19 outbreak is just another chance for companies to re-examine the\nrelationship between companies and employees, and to elevate their corporate\nculture to be mutually beneficial.\"  \n\nMilliken of Prophet points out that more flexibility could come with a\npotential downside. \"The adoption of work-from-home technology could actually\nmake the overwork culture even more widespread,\" he says, referring to the\ninfamous [\"996\"\nculture](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190718-china-996), in which\ntech and start-up employees work from nine in the morning to nine in the\nevening, six days a week.\n\nCindy Song, 29, who is a manager for PR firm Ruder Finn, is on the fence about\nwhether home working is a success. \"Our home is not big - husband and I are\nworking in the same room, we disturb each other,\" she says. She's also worried\nabout the future; her boss says this year might be hard if clients cancel\nevents due to the coronavirus and reduce marketing budgets.\n\nBut one positive has been her \"improved marriage\" due to spending 24 hours a\nday with her husband. \"Before this 'special time' we were so busy; busy\nworking and coming home very late. Now we can spend more time with each other,\nwe are closer than before,\" she says.\n\n_Additional reporting: Manyu Jiang_\n\n[Share using Email](mailto:?subject=Shared from\nBBC:How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-from-\nhome%20experiment&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.email)[Share on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-\nhome%20experiment&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.twitter&via=BBC_Worklife)[Share on\nFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.facebook&t=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-home%20experiment)[Share on\nLinkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.linkedin&title=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-home%20experiment)\n\nOpen share tools\n\n[Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCWorklife)[Follow us on\nTwitter](https://www.twitter.com/BBC_Worklife)[Follow us on\nInstagram](https://www.instagram.com/BBC_Worklife)[Sign up to our\nnewsletter](http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/)\n\n## Similar Articles\n\n[![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/nz/p085nzfv.jpg)](/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling)\n\n[The irrationality of panic buying](/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling)\n\nAround the BBC\n\n## Explore the BBC\n\n  * [Home](https://www.bbc.co.uk)\n  * [News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news)\n  * [Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport)\n  * [Weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather)\n  * [iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer)\n  * [Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds)\n  * [CBBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc)\n  * [CBeebies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies)\n  * [Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food)\n  * [Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize)\n  * [Arts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts)\n  * [Taster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster)\n  * [Local](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/localnews)\n  * [Three](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/)\n  * [About the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy/)\n  * [Cookies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/cookies/)\n  * [Accessibility Help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/)\n  * [Parental Guidance](https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidance)\n  * [Contact the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact)\n  * [Get Personalised Newsletters](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnewsletter)\n\n _Copyright (C) 2020 BBC._ The BBC is not responsible for the content of\nexternal sites.

Microsoft is advising customers to move to LinkedIn\nTalent Hub instead. At the same time, Microsoft is repackaging some of its\n\"core\" human resources capabilities in Dynamics 365 Talent and releasing it as\nDynamics 365 Human Resources on February 3, 2020.  \n  \nMicrosoft made these announcements in a couple of December 6 blog posts (one\nof which I saw thanks to [Microsoft MVP Jukka\nNiiranen](https://twitter.com/jukkan/status/1203003347235745792) on Twitter).\nMicrosoft's Dynamics web site already reflects the coming change, noting that\n[Dynamics 365 Talent has been rebranded as Dynamics 365 Human\nResources](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/talent-to-human-resources/).  \n  \nMicrosoft is telling customers who are using its core Dynamics HR capabilities\ntoday that they will be automatically transitioned to the coming Dynamics 365\nHuman Resources product. Until then, Microsoft says they will continue to\nsupport Attract and Onboard, and that current customers can renew their\ncontracts for these apps up until June 6, 2020. Microsoft will provide\ncritical bug support for Attract and Onboard until February 1, 2022, but won't\nbe adding any new features to those products.  \n  \nLinkedIn Talent Hub is an application tracking system for sourcing, managing\nand hiring. It is built on top of the core LinkedIn network. Talent Hub\nincludes LinkedIn Recruiter and Jobs together into a single platform.  \n  \nMicrosoft made [Dynamics 365 Talent, its first human-capital-management (HCM)\noffering, available in July 2017](https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-next-on-\nmicrosofts-linkedin-and-dynamics-integration-list/). At that time, it included\nintegration with LinkedIn Recruiter.  \n  \nAnother Microsoft December 6 blog post explains [what else will be included in\nthe coming Dynamics 365 Human Resources\noffering](https://community.dynamics.com/365/b/365teamblog/posts/building-a-\nmore-successful-workforce-with-dynamics-365-human-resources):  \n  \n\"In October, we announced our investments in [the rights to strategic\nsolutions from FourVision and Elevate\nHR](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-\ninvestments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence/) to accelerate HR\noperations innovation within leave and absence, time and attendance, and\nbenefits administration. These new capabilities will begin rolling out within\nDynamics 365 Human Resources in early 2020.\"\n\nIt's interesting to see Microsoft start to make greater use its LinkedIn\nassets rather than just [letting LinkedIn run basically as an independent\nentity](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-linkedin-report-card-\ntechnology-integration-continues-but-at-a-slow-pace/).

The Series B round -- which moves the\nfirm\u2019s total raise to $19.7 million -- was led by Sequoia India and saw\nparticipation from existing investors Lightspeed India Partners, Endiya\nPartners and 3one4 Capital.\n\nMore than 200 firms -- including giants such as adtech firm [InMobi,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/inmobi) fintech startup [Paytm,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/paytm) drink conglomerate Bisleri,\nautomobile maker Mahindra, Kotak group and delivery firms Swiggy and\nMilkbasket -- use Darwinbox\u2019s HR platform to serve half a million of their\nemployees in 50 nations, Rohit Chennamaneni, co-founder of [Darwinbox,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/darwinbox) told TechCrunch in an\ninterview.\n\nThe startup, which competes with giants such as SAP and [Oracle,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle) said its platform enables a high\nlevel of configurability and ease of use, and understands the needs of modern\nemployees. \u201cThe employees today who have grown accustomed to using consumer-\nfocused services such as Uber and Amazon are left disappointed in their\nexperience with their own firm\u2019s HR offerings,\u201d said Gowthami Kanumuru, VP\nMarketing at Darwinbox, in an interview.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s HR platform offers a range of features, including the ability for\nfirms to offer their employees insurance and early salary as loans. Its\nplatform also features social networks for employees within a company to\nconnect and talk, as well as an AI assistant that allows them to apply for a\nleave or set up meetings with quick voice commands from their phone.\n\n\u201cThe AI system is not just looking for certain keywords. If an employee tells\nthe system he or she is not feeling well today, it automatically applies a\nleave for them,\u201d she said.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s platform is built to handle onboarding new employees, keep a tab\non their performance, monitor attrition rate and maintain an ongoing feedback\nloop. Or as Kanumuru puts it, the entire \u201chiring to retiring\u201d cycle.\n\nOne of Darwinbox\u2019s clients is L&T, which is tasked with setting up subways in\nmany Indian cities. L&T is using Darwin's geo-fencing feature to log the\nattendance of employees. \u201cThey are not using biometric punch machine that is\ntypically used by other firms. Instead, they just require their 1,200\nemployees to check-in from the workplace using their phones,\u201d said Kanumuru.\n\n![darwinbox event](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/darwinbox_event.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, Darwinbox is largely focusing on serving companies based in Asia\nas it believes Western companies\u2019 solutions are not a great fit for people\nhere, said Kanumuru. The startup began courting clients in Southeast Asian\nmarkets last year.\n\n\u201cOur growth is a huge validation for our vision,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin six months\nof operations, we had the delivery giant [Delhivery\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/delhivery) with over 23,000 employees\nuse our platform.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, Dev Khare, a partner at [Lightspeed\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial) Venture, said,\n\u201cthere is a new trend of SaaS companies targeting the India/SE Asia markets.\nThis trend is gathering steam and is disproving the conventional wisdom that\nAsia-focused SaaS companies cannot get to be big companies. We firmly believe\nthat Asia-focused SaaS companies can get to large impact value and become\nlarge and profitable. Darwinbox is one of these companies.\u201d\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s Chennamaneni said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand\nits footprints in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other Southeast Asian\nmarkets. Darwinbox also will expand its product offerings to address more of\nemployees\u2019 needs. The startup is also looking to make its platform enable\ntasks such as booking of flights and hotels.\n\nChennamaneni, an alum of [Google ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/google)\nand McKinsey, said Darwinbox aims to double the number of clients it has in\nthe next six to nine months.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "The Top 10 Free and Open Source HR Technology Solutions - Solutions Review", "link": "https://solutionsreview.com/talent-management/2020/02/04/the-top-free-and-open-source-hr-technology-solutions/", "guid": "CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc29sdXRpb25zcmV2aWV3LmNvbS90YWxlbnQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC8yMDIwLzAyLzA0L3RoZS10b3AtZnJlZS1hbmQtb3Blbi1zb3VyY2UtaHItdGVjaG5vbG9neS1zb2x1dGlvbnMv0gEA", "pubdate": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://solutionsreview.com/talent-management/2020/02/04/the-top-free-and-open-source-hr-technology-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\">The Top 10 Free and Open Source HR Technology Solutions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Solutions Review</font>", "source": "Solutions Review", "body": ""}, {"item": "What is the best HCM software for your organization? - Human Resources Director", "link": "https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/hr-technology/what-is-the-best-hcm-software-for-your-organization/212711", "guid": "CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjYW1hZy5jb20vdXMvc3BlY2lhbGl6YXRpb24vaHItdGVjaG5vbG9neS93aGF0LWlzLXRoZS1iZXN0LWhjbS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1mb3IteW91ci1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24vMjEyNzEx0gEA", "pubdate": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/hr-technology/what-is-the-best-hcm-software-for-your-organization/212711\" target=\"_blank\">What is the best HCM software for your organization?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Human Resources Director</font>", "source": "Human Resources Director", "body": "![Human Resources Director America](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n[CONTINUE TO SITE __](javascript:dismissIntromercial\\(\\); \"Close\")\n\n![Human Resources Director America](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n[CONTINUE TO SITE __](javascript:dismissIntromercialAndGo\\(\\); \"Close\")\n\n__\n\n[ ![](/images/logo_normal.png) ](/us)\n\n[AU](/au)\n\n[NZ](/nz)\n\n[CA](/ca)\n\n[US](/us)\n\n[Asia](/asia)\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n  * [NEWS](/us/news/general)\n\n    * [News](/us/news/general)\n    * [Opinion and best practice](/us/news/opinion-and-best-practice)\n    * [Profiles](/us/news/profiles)\n\n  * [ SPECIALIZATION ](/us/specialization)\n\n    * [Benefits](/us/specialization/benefits)\n    * [Change management](/us/specialization/change-management)\n    * [Corporate wellness](/us/specialization/corporate-wellness)\n    * [Diversity & inclusion](/us/specialization/diversity-inclusion)\n    * [Employee engagement](/us/specialization/employee-engagement)\n    * [Financial wellness](/us/specialization/financial-wellness)\n    * [HR technology](/us/specialization/hr-technology)\n    * [Immigration](/us/specialization/immigration)\n    * [Industrial relations](/us/specialization/industrial-relations)\n    * [Leadership](/us/specialization/leadership)\n    * [Learning & development](/us/specialization/learning-development)\n    * [Mental health](/us/specialization/mental-health)\n    * [MICE](/us/specialization/mice)\n    * [Payroll](/us/specialization/payroll)\n    * [Workplace health and safety](/us/specialization/workplace-health-and-safety)\n    * [Recruitment](/us/specialization/recruitment)\n    * [Reward & recognition](/us/specialization/reward-recognition)\n\n  * [EVENTS](/us/hr-events)\n\n    * [US HR events](/us/hr-events)\n    * [All HR events](/us/all-hr-events)\n\n  * [JOBS](/us/jobs)\n  * [RESOURCES](/us/resources)\n\n    * [Multimedia](/us/resources)\n\n  * [SUBSCRIBE](/us/newsletter)\n  * __\n\n  1.

An HRIS is often referred to an\nHRMS (human resources management system) since it aids in effective human\nresource management and planning.\n\nAn HRIS includes under its umbrella a wide range of systems. For example, it\nincludes all aspects of managing the employee database and directory,\napplicant tracking, benefits administration, payroll processes, work\nscheduling, time and attendance, leaves tracking, electronic signatures,\ncompliance protocols, customizable insight reports, employee self-service,\n**[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , and HR processes taken care of on\nmobile apps.\n\nThis list, long as it may be, is not written in stone. It differs within both\nclient and vendor organizations based on the needs of the human capital that\nrequires to be managed, employee strength, the geographical spread of an\norganization, the basic protocols of functioning that it adheres to, and its\nmap for the future.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Human Capital Management (HCM)? Definition, Process,\nPlatforms (tools) with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS Processes and Working Components**\n\nAt present, all human resource functions are dealing with quite a data dump\nsince every interaction that a candidate or an employee has with the\norganization is captured and stored as data. A human resource information\nsystem thus becomes crucial in making sense of all this data \u2013 to not only\ncollect and store data effectively but to gather the information that would\nenable effective workflow and improve efficiency.\n\nMost HRIS solutions today offer customized systems based on the unique needs\nand growth plans of the organization. Let\u2019s take a peek into the six key HRIS\nprocesses and working components that most organizations require in some\ncombination.\n\n### **1\\. Database management**\n\n  \nThe core offering of most human resource information system solutions is a\nready-access database where all employee information can be stored and managed\neffectively. The HR team (or anyone managing the portal) can easily input all\npersonnel data into the system. The point is to be able to access all this\ndata and relevant metric from it on demand from anywhere across the globe.\n\nThe kind of data stored on the system ranges from compensation information,\nemergency contact details, and education history to present contact\ninformation, learning metrics, and performance review scores. The database\nforms the heart of all HR functions and could prove to be an effective online\nor cloud-hosted backup for a largely paperless office.\n\n### **2\\. Time and labor management**\n\n  \nMonitoring the clocking hours of every single employee is a time-intensive\ntask. With a majority of offices today allowing employees to either punch in\nbiometrically or log on to input their own hours, this daily dose of data\nneeds effective management.\n\nManagers can now approve leave requests, and the data can be directly linked\nto payroll. A non-intrusive but efficient human resource information system\ncan thus keep a close tab on punctuality and attendance.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)**\n\n### **3\\. Payroll functions**\n\n  \nPayroll is one of the most important functions of HR. With a lean human\nresource information system allowing easy download or upload of employee hours\nand attendance data, the number crunch can be made a lot simpler, and deposits\nto employees made more seamless. This also leads to fewer errors by reducing\nhuman intervention. Moreover, most HRIS payroll software lead to an\nimprovement in tax compliance, especially for organizations that deal with\nmultiple tax levels.\n\n### **4\\. Benefits management**\n\n  \nBenefits management does not pertain only to medical benefits and retirement\ninvestments, but all queries, feedback, data, and communication related to\nbenefits. Such applications provide a one-stop platform experience for all\nemployers and employees alike, add transparency, and enable smoother\noperations.\n\nEvery employee is affected by the benefits regulations and strategy, and how\nthat is managed affects the total experience that the employee has at work.\n\n### **5\\. Employee interface**\n\n  \nMost human resource information system software allows limited user access to\nemployees, but even that moderate level of employee self-service is a step\nforward in creating a culture where employees have more operational freedom.\nThe interface that allows employees to update their personal information,\nreview pay scales, change retirement benefit programs, update direct deposit\ninformation or download benefit election documents needs to provide a user\nexperience that is easy, integrated, and time-saving.\n\n### **6\\. Talent acquisition and retention**\n\n  \nAcquiring and retaining the right talent is how an organization can hope to\ngrow. With that context in mind, recruitment and retention are crucial\ncomponents of any HRIS and are ranked by most organizations as must-have\nfeatures.\n\nGetting the right talent onboard is just the first step to the talent puzzle.\nEmployees also need to be provided with the right training, career pathing,\nand reward plans to enable growth, boost morale, and create job happiness.\nHRIS tools can improve the candidate experience while also making it easier\nfor recruiters to source, track, and engage with the right talent.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **HRIS Models**\n\nNow that we have had a glance at the systems and working components that move\nthe human resource information system machinery, let\u2019s dig into the HRIS\nmodels that guide the functioning of its processes.\n\n### **1\\. Input and output model of a basic HRIS**\n\n  \nThis model enumerates the basic functioning of an HRIS \u2013 from input to output.\nBoth environmental and internal sources provide data for the input subsystems,\nwhich are then interpreted into information and used in recruiting, workforce\nplanning, workforce/[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/), compensation, benefits, and for various parts of the reporting\nchannel.\n\n![Input and output model of a basic HRIS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Input and output model of a basic HRIS_**\n\n### **2.** **Model for HRIS adoption**\n\n  \nWith a plethora of options available in the market (to the point where the\nmarket seems overcrowded), choosing the right HRIS is a big decision. But once\nthat is done, to ensure that the organization has invested in a winning\nsystem, the right adoption of the HRIS is necessary. Here\u2019s a model that\nenumerates the different aspects of adopting the right HRIS and adapting to\nnew processes.\n\n![HRIS adoption model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2.

HRIS success model**\n\n  \nThe following figure is the integrated HRIS model for success. This is to\nreiterate how the users\u2019 perception of the system is affected by the quality\nof system processes, information access and application, ease of use, and\nusefulness.\n\nThe perceived utility of the HRIS is an interesting factor since it is quite\nsubjective and must make sense to the employee. All these factors together\ncontribute to the level of user satisfaction and ultimately to the success of\nthe HRIS.\n\n![HRIS success model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 3.

We are following\nguidelines from health officials and medical experts, and are taking extreme\nmeasures to ensure the safety of employees at our site,\" Amazon spokesman\nTimothy Carter said in a statement.\n\nFacility leaders say they have made employees at the site aware of this\nconfirmed case and are alerting any associates who had close contact with the\nindividual and will as them to self-quarantine for 14 days. They will be paid\nfor their time at home.\n\nThis additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time\nthey need to return to good health without the worry of lost income. This is\nin addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the\nend of April.\n\nThe company says they have put several preventative health measures for\nemployees, delivery and transportation partners at our sites around the world.\nThese measures include:\n\n  * Increased the frequency and intensity of cleaning at all sites including regular sanitization of all door handles, stairway handrails, elevator buttons, lockers, and touch screens, to name a few.\n  * Adjusted practices to ensure social distancing within our buildings, including:\n  * No standup meetings during shifts \u2013 all business essential information will be shared via boards near main areas and through conversations with managers, or HR team members\n  * Moving chairs and spreading out tables in breakrooms\n  * Shift start times and break times are being staggered to promote social distancing\n  * Suspended exit screening until further notice to ensure ease of movement near main entrances\n  * Enabled temporary cell phone process for those who need to be in contact with their families or childcare providers\n  * Training will take place in small formats and with inapp training tools and other equipment\n  * Requiring employees to stay home and seek medical attention if they are feeling unwell and have adjusted attendance policies to support this. \n  * Requiring employees to sanitize and clean their work stations and vehicles at the start and end of every shift with disinfectant/cleaning wipes.\n  * Asked employees to defer non-essential travel.\n  * Moved to video-based interviews for the majority of our candidate interviews.\n  * Communicated to employees that everyone must wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Click

Whether it was through Christmas bonuses, health care\nbenefits, or merely ensuring comfortable chairs at work, there have always\nbeen employers (albeit unknown and uncelebrated) who have tried to drive\nengagement at work. Having been through decades of slow evolution, it is not\nsurprising then that the basic map of employee engagement ideas that work has\nnot changed much.\n\nAre you stuck in age-old ways of engaging your employees?\n\nIs your idea of employee engagement still a boring survey followed by a\ncompulsory \"team activity\"?\n\nIt could often feel like we are drowning in the background noise of the same\nideas, just packaged differently.\n\nWhether we look at reports like Aon Hewitt's Global Trends in Employee\nEngagement, Quantum Workplace's Workplace Trends, or more recent reports like\nDeloitte's [Talent\n2020](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/about-\ndeloitte/Talent2020_Employee-Perspective.pdf) series, what stands out is that\nin the last decade, there have been certain persistent trends in employee\nengagement.\n\nFor example, over the last decade, there has been a rise in the perceived\nimportance of the employee value proposition and innovation. These facets of\n**[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/)** have now been identified as key\ndrivers of engagement. How valued and supported employees feel has emerged as\nyet another metric that determines levels of engagement, as has the quest for\nmeaningful work.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)\n\n## **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020**\n\nThe trends mentioned above, along with the growing emphasis on **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand employee experience, demand not only attention but action as well. So,\nlet's look at 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020.\n\n### **1\\. Celebrate what employees achieve in their downtime**\n\n  \nHR should be mindful of an employee's 360-degree goals and targets, even\noutside the workplace. Someone may be an accomplished artist, chef, or\nmarathon runner \u2013 and recognition in these areas is as important as typical\nworkplace recognition.\n\nAn excellent employee engagement activity for 2020 would be hosting weekly\nmeetups where every employee/team shares stories of their downtime pursuits,\nwhat they have achieved and future hopes/goals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-engage-employees-impactful-\nsolutions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n### **2\\. Upgrade communications to include video**\n\n  \nYour upgraded intranets, frequent mailers, and a cake-for-every-occasion can\nonly take you so far. They will not crack the code to the ultimate employee\nexperience. To truly provide the fabled \"holistic experience for a\nmultigenerational workforce,\" you must crack the video code.\n\nEvery employee is a consumer, and if video content works better for your\nexternal customers, it would work for your internal customers too.\n\nA video is also an excellent tool for pan-company announcements and to engage\nwith your deskless workforce, your gig workers, and your remote workers.\n\nEveryone loves a bit of the limelight, and broadcasting short culture-centric\nvideos of real employees speaking about their achievements and aspirations\nhelps to build a strong connection with the rest of your workforce. For people\nwho don't come to headquarters every day, videos can help them feel connected\nwith their teams and give them a sense of belonging and engagement.\n\n### **3\\. Give your pulse surveys a makeover**\n\n  \nWith Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, you can create pulse surveys with ease and\ncustomize them to suit your needs. But who says that a survey needs to look\nand feel like a survey? Ticking through boxes of endless options and choosing\nnumbers on a Likert scale are not the only way that your employees can tell\nyou how engaged they are.\n\nYou could ask for short WhatsApp voice notes not more than 20 seconds long \u2013\nan easy investment for your employees and for you \u2013 that encapsulates how the\nweek went. You could even do the same by asking them to upload a picture a\nweek.\n\nEmployees could also take a quick mood test, or engagement analytics tools\nthat study search trends within work systems that could give you a glimpse of\nthe general mood throughout the organization.\n\n### **4\\. Implement a non-anonymized survey to measure the engagement**\n\n  \nAnonymizing the results of an **[employee engagement\nsurvey](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** has\nalways been a best practice. And this continues to hold for more formal\nsurveys, where you measure company-wide engagement/satisfaction levels. But\nyou could also implement a non-anonymized survey for small teams and employee\ngroups.\n\nMake this a fun employee engagement activity \u2013 hand out post-its after a\nmeeting where employees can jot down their feedback with a clear signature.\nThis will help them take ownership of feedback and feel like they are being\nheard as individuals, and not as an anonymized voice in a dataset.\n\n### **5\\. Enable remote working**\n\n  \nThe modern office is not a place but a function, and in our age of instant\n(and constant!) connectivity, this function could be carried out from\nanywhere. If your company policy does not allow a work-from-home option, it\ncosts you the chance to hire and engage a massive variety of diverse talent.\n\nIt is not just millennials who demand remote working tools and flexible\nculture. While they would make up 75% of the workforce by 2020, the minority\ngenerations at work would benefit as well.\n\nCreating a culture that is anytime-anywhere (by using collaborative systems\nlike Slack, easy video-calling solutions, and ensuring regular check-ins)\nmakes your mobile workforce feel valued and trusted.\n\nThat is a sure boost to engagement because then work becomes a more enjoyable\nexercise where employees' values, goals, and vision can coexist with those of\nthe organization.\n\n### **6\\. But say goodbye to the always-on culture for a week every quarter**\n\n  \nIt isn't always possible to switch off every time we step out of the office \u2013\nbut you could make it a mandate for at least one week a quarter, where\nemployees must remain unavailable outside of work hours. Convey clearly that\nno one should expect a response to an email or an instant message during this\nweek once the employee has left for the day.\n\nActivities like these are critical to reduce burnout and ensure that employees\nare adequately refreshed to maintain optimal productivity levels. They also\nhelp employees feel cared for, just like the company's customers.\n\n### **7\\. Encourage employees to become company brand ambassadors**\n\n  \nYour employer brand needs storytellers. Cultivating a band of employee brand\nambassadors serves a two-fold purpose \u2013 fostering a strong sense of pride and\nbelongingness within employees and building a credible employer brand that\ncandidates, clients, and external points of contact can believe in.\n\nWith employees being active contributors on platforms like Snapchat,\nInstagram, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor, the art of branded storytelling can be\nmore effective and is more critical than ever before. A lot of millennials\nespecially engage while engaging others and thrive in an environment that\nallows them to express their views and opinions on social platforms.\n\n### **8\\. Invest in gamification at different levels of the employee\nlifecycle**\n\n  \nWe've all heard of how gamified candidate selection or gamified corporate\nlearning has been creating ripples. But often, considerable shifts in\ntechnology and strategy are usually a \"them\" change before they become an \"us\"\nchange.\n\nWhile new-age technology can help you elevate gamification, you could put\ngamified processes to use even without futuristic tech. Game-based learning\nnot only boosts productivity levels, but also brings in a note of fun that\nencourages a bit of friendly competition, enhances collaboration, and elevates\nthe drive to succeed.\n\nYou could assign a day for some trivia quizzed on general knowledge and the\ncompany's brand or have a monthly tournament of Chess or Settlers of Catan,\nwhere teams have to collaborate strategically. Introducing relevant games such\nas these into the company culture would only enhance the overall employee\nexperience.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Employee Experience: Are They\nReally That Different?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-employee-experience-are-they-different/)\n\n### **9\\. Offer a two-way mentorship program across departments**\n\n  \nTwo-way mentorship programs are an excellent strategy for upskilling and\nemployee engagement. They open up employees to new areas of learning and can\nserve as the key to unlocking hidden talent. It also helps employees\nunderstand their role in the larger organization.\n\nFor example, consider a two-way mentorship between a software developer and a\nmarketer. The former gets to know how their product is positioned in the\nmarket, while the latter receives a hands-on idea of the product they are\nmarketing. In the long-term, this strategy also has the potential to bolster\nyour productivity levels.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **10\\. Host frequent workshops**\n\n  \nAs adults, we tend to be averse to stepping outside our comfort zones and\nlearning new things. That is where fun workshops can shake things up.\nMoreover, this does not necessarily entail having to scour the market for\nexpensive coaches. You could source expertise internally as well.\n\nFor example, similar to the mentorship program, one of the coders could take a\ntwo-day workshop on basic HTML so that everyone in the product development\nteam knows what goes on in the backend. Workshops could also be engaging\nbrainstorming sessions or fun ideas like cocktail-making or baking that help\npeople get out of their routine while making them connect the balance of\ndifferent ingredients in a cocktail or a cake to the need for diversity at\nwork, for example.\n\n![employee engagement ideas](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020**\n\n### **11\\. Check your team's alignment to the organization's vision**\n\n  \nThe why of the organization \u2013 why it exists, why we do things the way we do\nthem, or why we wish to achieve one goal before another \u2013 is something that\nevery employee needs to understand and be on board with before they can truly\nbe engaged at work.\n\nVision alignment or being in sync with the vision of the organization is an\nessential pillar of engagement, and employees need to feel that the work that\nthey do matters and adds fuels the mission of the company.\n\nThe values and vision of the organization cannot exist merely on paper and\nwall-decals \u2013 they need to be lived every day. To do this, there should be\nenough scope for every employee to internalize what the organization stands\nfor and to align their own goals with organizational goals.\n\n### **12\\. Create an annual report of employee achievements**\n\n  \nAt the end of every year, companies publish a formalized annual report that\nshares its progress, achievements, and issues with the public. You can also\ntry a similar activity to increase employee engagement in 2020.\n\nReview performance data to find areas of outstanding performance \u2013 this could\nbe hard skills leading to business results, or soft skills that positively\nimpacted the work environment. Represent this data in a visual format, using\ncharts, infographics, badges, etc. This will encourage similar results and\nhigher productivity in the new year.\n\n### 13\\. Involve the entire company when onboarding new hires\n\nThis is particularly relevant for small-to-mid-sized businesses. Even large\nenterprises and 100% remote companies can leverage digital technology to\ngarner participation from every employee when someone new joins the company.\n\nHold a monthly onboarding day where the entire workforce gathers to welcome\nnew hires. You could also initiate a Slack thread called \"Hello! Let me tell\nyou about myself,\" where current employees (from interns to C-leaders) can\ntell the new hire something interesting about themselves. This will ensure\nthat employees are primed for engagement right from day one.\n\nBesides, for remote workers, instead of sending across the link to a recorded\nonboarding session, send them shorter video messages from team leaders and\ntheir teammates to inspire them.\n\n### **14\\. Invest in wellness at work**\n\n  \nA [report by Humana](https://www.humana.com/employer/group-benefits-101/after-\nenrollment/manage-employee-benefits/the-wellness-effect-the-impact-of-\nworkplace-programs/') called \"The Wellness Effect: The Impact of Workplace\nPrograms\" found that employee engagement and wellness are closely related. 67%\nof employees in organizations that prioritize wellness said that they felt\nmore engaged with the values and vision of the organization.\n\nWellness at work does not have to be a compulsory yoga class. Wellness\nincorporates within its umbrella physical, social, emotional, and financial\nwellness. Your wellness plan needs to be able to cater to all these aspects\nthat cumulatively ensure the holistic health of an employee.\n\nThere is also a need to destigmatize mental health challenges that many\nemployees could be facing but feel uncomfortable to ask about. Building\nsystems in place for decreasing workplace stress is more than an absolute\nnecessity.\n\nThis is an opportunity to help your employees understand that you care for\ntheir well-being, not merely to gain more productivity, but because that is\nwhat the organization believes in. Better performance is often just the\nbyproduct of a healthy workplace.\n\n### **15\\. Revamp rewards and recognition**\n\n  \nUsing AI to revamp rewards and recognition (R&R;) programs based on employee\nfeedback is a good way to get them more engaged. Employee engagement award\nideas that focus on rewarding behaviors that the organization values create a\nsense of achievement for being in tune with the culture at work. The process\nfor nomination or voting for this should be fair and objective. This helps\nfurther the cause of engagement.\n\nGiving out fun awards like the messiest-desk-but-gets-the-job-done, marbles\nunder their feet award, or an award for always thinking outside the box are a\ngreat way to get people to enjoy the process while also feeling valued and\nappreciated for what they do.\n\n### **16\\. Make diversity and inclusion the norm**\n\n  \nDiversity and inclusion is yet another facet of work that needs to become more\nthan just a mandate. It would be a fresh change for your employees to see the\norganization becoming more diverse. An environment that is an amalgamation of\ncultural, gender, and [generational\ndiversity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/the-need-for-\ngenerational-diversity-in-workplace/) is perceived to be alive and\ninteresting, and employees of all stripes thrive there.\n\nMoreover, a culture that is sensitive to the needs thought patterns, and\nideologies of individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, and\ngenerations are automatically more engaging.\n\nTo truly promote inclusivity, your organizational culture needs to allow every\nvoice to be heard. This involves allowing expression to individuals from\nminority groups and those more prone to being discriminated against.\n\nWhile taking the human out of certain screening processes could do away with\nbias, installing feedback loop portals at work that address diversity issues\nlike 15Five, OfficeVibe and CultureAmp help in setting a mechanism in place\nfor employees to express their voice at work. Besides ensuring a better mix of\nideas and perspectives, inclusivity at work also makes employees feel valued\nas individuals and not just a member of a specific group.\n\n### **17\\. Encourage work-life balance**\n\n  \nWe live in a world where attaining a [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/four-\nways-ai-is-improving-worklife-balance/) is still considered a victory, whereas\nit should be the norm. A regular working day should be one in which you get as\nmuch time for yourself and your family as you do for work. The idea is to\ncreate a schedule in which you do not feel like you are at a constant tug of\nwar between your duties at work and all that you want to accomplish outside of\nwork\n\nMaking employees always put in extra time and effort at work will lead to not\nonly burnout but also a noticeable dip in engagement. This is truer now when\nwe can always be connected to work, and where it could often be a challenge to\nswitch off our internal work mode.\n\nA transparent, open, and enabling culture would allow employees to share their\nvoice out in case they do feel that managing work and life is becoming\ndifficult. Interventions should then be arranged to find out where the problem\nlies and to make employees feel that they are not alone in their struggle.\n\n[Voice-of-the-employee\ntechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-voice-of-the-employee-technology/), individualized [employee assistance\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-administration/how-\nemployee-assistance-programs-improve-workplace-mental-health/) (EAPs), and\nguided group counseling sessions are some resources that could be put in place\nto create a culture that is inherently enabling and supportive.\n\n### **18\\. Plan creative CSR programs**\n\n  \nA [2019\nstudy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283129700_Impact_of_corporate_social_responsibility_on_employee_engagement_A_case_of_Eskom_in_South_Africa/link/5a1f68e5aca272cbfbc2f166/download)\nfinds that employee engagement and corporate social responsibility (CSR) work\ntogether to achieve organizational goals. It also found that business success\nwas partly driven by employee engagement arising from CSR.\n\nA [study by Kenexa Research Institute](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2008/09/11/1225374/0/en/The-Kenexa-Research-Institute-Reveals-Exactly-\nHow-Engaged-Employees-Are-and-What-Exactly-Employee-Engagement-Means.html)\nfurther asserts that how employees rate their pride in the organization, their\nlevel of satisfaction at work, and their willingness to recommend their\norganization to others is impacted by how they feel about the kind of work\nthat the organization does to give back to society.\n\nA genuine focus on CSR and [sustainability at\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/4-tips-to-create-a-\nculture-of-sustainability-in-the-workplace/) and can help build a personal\nconnection between the organization, the employee and the society while also\nharboring a sense of gratification in being able to add value to society at\nlarge.\n\n### **19\\. Upgrade your EVP**\n\n  \nEmployee value proposition (EVP) and **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** are closely related and both fall on the employee\nsatisfaction/happiness spectrum. EVP plays a part in how the employee\nperceives the employer brand right from the first telephonic interview until\ntheir last day and their direct impact on the employees' level of engagement\nand involvement at work.\n\nNow is the time to upgrade your EVP \u2013 the promise that you make to your\nemployees. In a market as riddled with dynamism and as wrecked with the\ncompetition, it is always helpful to take a step back and analyze what sets\nyou apart.\n\nWhat is the USP of the employee experience that you are promising? How can you\ndeliver better on this promise and make your employees want to be engaged?\n\nAnswering these questions will help you move towards engagement practices that\nare more organic and less transactional.\n\n### **20\\. Empower line managers to own employee engagement**\n\n  \nIt is time to delegate the onus of employee engagement to individuals beyond\nHR. [A white paper by Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/whos-\nresponsible-for-employee-engagement/') shows that companies like Rackspace,\nAT&T;, Progressive Insurance, Intuit, and Cintas reported better engagement\nnumbers when line managers took charge of leading employee engagement instead\nof HR managers.\n\nThis is an important finding suggesting that business leads can empower\nsupervisors and hold them accountable for the engagement of their teams while\ncreating a steady feedback loop.\n\nThe onus of employee engagement should be divided between the HR, line\nmanagers, the individual employee, and senior leaders. Top-down commitment\nacross all departments is necessary to encourage employees' commitment.\n\nMoreover, employees would automatically feel more engaged if they were made a\npart of the decisions regarding employee engagement and felt that their\nopinions mattered.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-\nquestions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n## **From Theory to Practice**\n\nA [study by Gallup ](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-\nengagement-drives-growth.aspx)found that teams that are deeply engaged are 21%\nmore productive. That's not all \u2013 Other research finds that investing just 10%\nmore in employee engagement can boost profits by $2,400 per employee annually.\n\nHow do you know whether your employee engagement ideas and activities are\nworking? Here are a few KPIs and questions that would help:\n\n**1\\. Engagement beyond work:** How many employees work outside regular\nworking hours (e.g., evenings and weekends)? Is this a good indicator of their\nown initiative, or were they asked to put in extra hours?\n\n**2\\. Broader corporate-social networks:** How many network connections does\nthe average employee have? How much time is spent with people outside of the\nimmediate team or region? This is a good indicator since passively disengaged\nemployees tend to have smaller social networks.\n\n**3\\. Participation without obligations:** What is the percentage of\nparticipation in ad-hoc meetings and initiatives that are unplanned and\nunstructured as opposed to recurring meetings and group events? For example,\ndo more employees attend team meetings where they feel attendance is mandatory\nas opposed to casual team lunches?\n\n**4\\. Branded communications:** Is any time spent in collaborating directly\nwith customers or outsiders beyond the normal scope of work? How are these\ninteractions? Is the company brand upheld with pride?\n\nThe KPIs and questions above are ones that you should keep an eye on.\n\nEmployee engagement activities must blend into a broader strategy and your\ncompany's culture to be truly effective. Without this, you are left with what\nJoelle Kaufman (CMO at Dynamic Signal) calls \"fireworks and smoke.\"\n\n\"One common mistake is what I call 'the fireworks and the smoke.' When it gets\nstarted, there's a lot of excitement, swag, a party. But a few weeks later,\nthe fireworks are over and there's just smoke. This is not a program or a\ncampaign. It's a fundamental way of operating. If you want to engage\nemployees, you have to be consistently putting out content that solicits\nengagement. It can't be just fireworks and smoke,\" she\n[said](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-engagement/building-\na-culture-of-organizational-engagement-in-conversation-with-joelle-kaufman-\ncmo-at-dynamic-signal/).\n\nEmployee engagement initiatives should go beyond protecting the bottom line \u2013\nthey should be a way of life at work.\n[Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-\ngrowth.aspx) reported 37% less absenteeism, 90% less turnover, and 28% less\nsafety incidents in organizations with higher employee engagement scores.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck for new ways to improve engagement levels in your\norganization, give these ideas a shot. Remember to measure their effectiveness\nand keep modifying the concept to suit your employees' needs.\n\n**_Do you have any innovative employee engagement ideas?

He had some interesting tips and insights to share.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Identify Flight-Risk\nEmployees**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-identify-flightrisk-employees/)\n\n## **6 Useful Ideas for Retaining Employees in 2020**\n\nRecent research suggests that companies need a proactive strategy for\nretaining employees. More than three out of four employees who left an\norganization in 2019 could have been retained, according to a [Work Institute\nstudy covering 250,000 US\nemployees](http://info.workinstitute.com/retentionreport2019).\n\nThere can be several causes of\n[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/). Black shared an example: \u201cAccording to Glint\ndata, employees are six times more likely to consider leaving their\norganization if they do not rate their manager highly, compared with those who\ndo.\u201d The report suggested that 11% of employees could not be retained due to\nmanager behavior. Career development (22%), and work-life balance (12%) are\nthe two other leading causes of attrition.\n\nSo, how do you control attrition among your workforce and maintain a healthy\nretention rate? Here are six tips to consider:\n\n### **1\\. Enhance employee experience by focusing on the \u201clittle things\u201d**\n\nSatisfactory pay, sufficient leaves, and a fair workload are basic employee\nrequirements. Apart from this, your workforce could be facing other seemingly\nsmall challenges during their everyday tasks and assignments. For example, the\n[time and attendance ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workforce-\nscheduling/five-features-to-look-for-in-a-time-and-attendance-\nsystem/)mechanism could have bugs, compelling employees to manually mark\nattendance and get approvals. Or, employees may opt for a paid leave during\nthe holiday season, which wasn\u2019t registered \u2013 this hampers their work-life\nbalance.\n\nOver time, these \u201clittle things\u201d add up, impacting [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/). By implementing regular pulse surveys, you can stay\nup-to-date on employee needs, sentiment, and complaints (if any). This will\nhelp you take course corrective measures.\n\nFor example, Costco decided to give its workforce a day off on Thanksgiving \u2013\ndespite it being peak shopping period. This has helped the company achieve a\n[94% retention rate](https://fortune.com/longform/costco-wholesale-shopping/)\nfor employees who have been there for a year, a number far higher than the\nindustry average.\n\n### **2\\. Help your managers prioritize employee engagement**\n\n[LinkedIn recently analyzed ](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-\nsolutions/blog/trends-and-research/2019/3-factors-linked-to-better-employee-\nretention)32 million profiles to plot a \u201cretention curve,\u201d and it reaffirms\nthe value of good management. Companies where management was highly rated, had\na 48% chance of retaining employees even after three years. For those with low\nmanagement ratings, this number fell to 32%.\n\n\u201cManagers play a critical role in creating a high-performance organization,\u201d\nsays Black. \u201cManagers impact so much of the employee experience, from helping\ntheir teams stay aligned and on track with goals to having effective\nconversations about career development and finding opportunities for their\nteam members to grow.\u201d Ask employees to review their manager\u2019s performance and\nwork on [manager engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/are-you-taking-care-of-manager-engagement/) as well, as a key\nretention measure. You can also look at [AI-driven performance feedback\nsolutions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/ai-driven-performance-feedback/) so managers have the right data and\ninsights to engage employees.\n\n### **3\\. Offer learning and career progression across the employee journey**\n\nIn many ways, [career development and\nlearning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/skills-\nfor-a-career-in-learning-and-development/) are more valued than benefits. It\nboosts employees\u2019 overall employability and ensures that they can find\nmeaningful opportunities beyond their current role. This is of great value to\nany professional and can boost their loyalty to your company to a significant\ndegree.\n\nIn fact, the Work Institute report we cited previously, found that the\npercentage of attrition attributed to career development went up by 32%\nbetween 2013 and 2018.\n\nReimagine employee experience in 2020, from a learning and development\nperspective. For example, you can [deploy learning as part of daily\nworkflows](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nto-deploy-workplace-learning-for-maximum-productivity/), to increase\nproductivity and ensure that the lessons learned are remembered in the long\nterm. Personalized L&D; and cross-disciplinary training are other key areas\nthat deserve your attention. This can help in retaining high-potential\nworkers, as this will be the demographic most interested in developing their\nskills.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is an Employee Engagement Survey? Definition, Process,\nVendors, and Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)**\n\n### **4\\. Hold on to tried-and-tested employee engagement initiatives**\n\nTraditional engagement ideas like Casual Friday, in-office contests,\nsuggestion boxes, Secret Santa during the holiday season, etc. make a big\ndifference to employee loyalty. Such initiatives foster a sense of community,\nso your workforce feels like a connected \u201cfamily\u201d working towards a shared\nvision.\n\nYou can complement these initiatives with digital tools \u2013 for example, an iPad\npositioned in the lobby to collect candid employee suggestions or a Slack\nthread dedicated to sharing work-related memes. \u201cCreating a workplace culture\nthat fosters a sense of belonging ultimately translates to a more engaged and\nproductive workforce that advocates on behalf of the company they represent,\u201d\nsays Black.\n\n### **5\\. Laterally transition employees to new roles when they are ready**\n\nA high-performing employee might be getting restless with their current job\nrole and could be interested in new, challenging areas. It\u2019s vital that a\nchange in responsibilities is available within the company, so your top-\nperformers do not have to look elsewhere.\n\nThe LinkedIn study found that employees who changed jobs internally were more\nthan 70% more likely to stay on after two years, compared to 56% of those who\ndidn\u2019t see a change.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter whether they are promoted or it\u2019s a lateral change \u2013\neither way, it is easier to retain employees by helping them diversify than\nkeeping them contained within one role.\n\nLeverage [continuous performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-continuous-performance-management-and-4-reasons-you-need-it/) to\npinpoint the right time for a role change. This will help to detect instances\nof employees getting complacent, or poor employee-to-job fitment. By keeping\nan eye on these indicators, you can initiate a role-change and preempt\nattrition.\n\n### **6\\. Empower your workers and enable autonomy**\n\nYour employees are eager to find a sense of purpose in their work and take\nownership of tasks, decisions, and business outcomes. That\u2019s why you need to\nprovide empowerment in the workplace to retain employees successfully.\n\nThe LinkedIn study we mentioned found that empowered employees are 47% more\nlikely to stay with a company after three years, compared to 35% of employees\nat a company with low empowerment ratings.\n\nAn excellent way to enable autonomy is to implement self-service wherever\npossible; this could be [self-service\nHR,](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-self-service/4-ways-to-\nincrease-employee-self-service-adoption/) IT, and analytics. Further, benefits\nsuch as flexible hours and remote working can drive autonomy by allowing\nemployees to choose how, when, and where they work. Measures like these are\ncritical to fostering a sense of empowerment, not to mention helping to\nachieve the work-life balance your employees need.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Train New Employees: 5 Steps for\nPlanning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/how-to-train-new-employees-steps-for-success/)**\n\n## **In 2020, Look Beyond Year-Wise Milestones When Retaining Employees**\n\nWe often hear that someone who has stayed with a company for three years or\nmore is considered \u201cretained.\u201d But their contribution remains valuable beyond\nthese year-wise milestones. \u201cAn effective retention strategy focuses on\nensuring employees are happy at work, learning often, and feeling their\ncontribution to the organization. As long as these basic needs are met,\nemployees will not have to look elsewhere for them, not in one year nor in\nfive years,\u201d says Black.\n\nHR needs to make sure that companies:\n\n  * Recognize and fulfill employees\u2019 career development goals\n  * Streamline workplace experiences by removing process-based roadblocks\n  * Equip managers with the tools required for heightened engagement\n  * Strengthen internal communication so employees feel connected to senior leadership\n\nThese strategies can go a long way in retaining employees in today\u2019s\ncompetitive labor market. Take a fiercely employee-centric stance in 2020, and\nbuild a loyal, productive, and future-ready workforce.\n\n_What steps have you taken for retaining employees \u2013 particularly top-tier\ntalent?

to keep employers on the right side of the law, while\nalso empowering employees.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December 3, 2019 \u2022

compliance](https://hrexecutive.com/report-compliance-issues-\ncontinue-to-concern-employers/), a moving target within the human resource\nspace, affects employers of all sizes. And as compliance continues to grow\nmore complicated, antiquated systems for staying on the right side of the law\nare being replaced by technology-driven solutions that can simplify success in\nreducing legal exposure.\n\nOne such solution\u2014albeit, a hybrid service comprised of both technology and\nthe human element\u2014is the recently released ADP Compliance on Demand, a\nworkforce-management platform designed to help employers perform employee\ntimekeeping, scheduling, attendance and leave management in ways that simplify\ncompliance with [wage and hour regulations](https://hrexecutive.com/changes-\nare-coming-to-pay-and-wage-rules/), according to David Palmieri, DVP, general\nmanager at ADP.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that business leaders and HR professionals alike need more than\ntechnology,\u201d Palmieri says. \u201cThey need a partner with expertise that can be\nleveraged to design a solution for the unique complexities of their business.\nMore than ever, organizations of all sizes are looking for ways to manage wage\nand hour compliance.\u201d\n\nAccording to ADP\u2019s Palmieri, those specific headaches may entail fundamental\nmatters such as absorbing a change like the [new overtime\nrule](https://hrexecutive.com/dol-finally-finalizes-overtime-rule/), where\nworker classification and overtime pay are the focus, or more complex multi-\nstate and jurisdictional pay- and work-rule compliance. In an [ever-changing\nregulatory landscape](https://hrexecutive.com/wrestling-with-workplace-\npolicies-and-regulations/) at the federal, state and local levels, maintaining\na culture of compliance can be especially challenging. ADP Compliance on\nDemand, he says, will save business leaders and HR professionals time and\nallow them to more easily respond to these multi-layered changes.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nPalmieri says the new service includes a comprehensive library of federal,\nstate and local materials, a compliance helpdesk and a community forum for\ncrowd-sourcing opinions and best practices.\n\nWith Compliance On Demand, ADP teamed up with the mega-employment law firm\nLittler Mendelson to enhance the service by incorporating Littler\u2019s GPS\nknowledge repository and by offering access to Littler compliance experts\nthrough the helpdesk.\n\nSharad Gera, vice president of financial operations at Reading, Pa.-based\nPenske Truck Leasing, an ADP client, says the convenience of having one source\nthat covers federal, state and local jurisdictions is a \u201chuge timesaver.\u201d\n\nGera says Penske operates in a very complex timekeeping and payroll\nenvironment, working across 48 states with union and non-union employees,\nnoting that Compliance on Demand provides Penske with \u201ctimely, well-rounded\nperspectives\u201d from ADP Compliance on Demand.\n\n\u201cThat guidance and reassurance is extremely valuable,\u201d Gera says.\n\nScott Forman, a shareholder at Littler, explains that the combined service\nwill expedite access to compliance information and allow clients to\nproactively collaborate with their legal and HR teams.\n\n\u201cThat synergy creates a culture of compliance that will not only lead to\nbusiness growth, but also to employee satisfaction and wellbeing,\u201d he says.\n\n**Caring for the Elderly, Complying with the Law**\n\n\u201cOngoing regulatory changes make HR compliance in the U.S. particularly\ndifficult,\u201d says Ted Malley, chief customer officer at Ceridian, which offers\na compliance component within its Dayforce Payroll, Benefits, Workforce\nManagement and Performance product. \u201cIt\u2019s further complicated by the large\nnumber of jurisdictions with potentially conflicting regulations that can\ncreate uncertainty for HR when determining what is or isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Malley adds, many U.S. employers choose to turn to litigation to\nresolve disputes, an issue that increases the risk that a company will end up\nin court for a real or perceived violation of labor and employment laws.\n\n\u201cMany elements of compliance headaches could be minimized by adopting an\neffective HCM solution,\u201d he says.\n\nAt MBK Senior Living, a Ceridian customer that offers independent-living,\nassisted-living and memory-care services to seniors across six states\n(Washington, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, California and Arizona), access to data\nhelps the company maintain compliance in an increasingly complex industry.\n\nAccording to Jeff Fischer, president of MBK Senior Living, based in Irvine,\nCalif., Dayforce helps the company automate its training records so that, if\nit has to show its records to an auditor or state regulator, MBK can easily\npull them. With the fluctuations in the workforce and the high turnover that\nMBK Senior Living periodically faces, Fischer notes, it's critically important\nfor it to be organized and on top of compliance and training records.\n\n\u201cNew technologies in the HR space are crucial to our success in the coming\nyears,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the shortage of talent, and us trying to find new ways\nto make our workforce more efficient, Dayforce helps further automate our\nprocesses and find ways to improve the lives of our employees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Turning to the Reporting Channel**\n\nJuliette Gust, founder and president of Ethics Suite, an online workplace-\nmisconduct and fraud-reporting channel, says keeping current with regulatory\nchanges around sexual-harassment and discrimination-reporting requirements\nmeans employers should check with outside counsel to ensure they\u2019re complying\nwith the most current regulatory framework. At the same time, while technology\nis a great way to manage the process, the emergence of platforms like social\nmedia carry high risk.\n\n\u201cWe see instances where employees are reporting potential misconduct directly\nthrough social media. At times, these employees are circumventing an existing\nreporting program,\u201d Gust says, adding it\u2019s critical that employers have a\nmeaningful and trusted program internally so employees feel they can report to\nthe employer, and that the employer will follow up with actions necessary to\naddress concerns or misconduct.\n\nShould an issue become public via social media, employers face the additional\nchallenge of rehabilitating their program and restoring any lost confidence in\ntheir ability to manage issues internally. Gust says steps should be taken to\nhelp the rehabilitation, including reiterating a strong commitment to\ncompliance, implementing or reinvesting in an anonymous reporting platform,\ntraining employees on how to communicate issues and company policies, and\ncommunicating the steps the company will take to respond.\n\nIn fact, several surveys and studies support the benefits of providing an\ninternal reporting platform with the [ability to report\nanonymously](https://hrexecutive.com/apps-help-anonymously-report-sexual-\nharassment/), if desired, she says. The Association of Certified Fraud\nExaminers\u2019 2018 _Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse_ survey\nresults, for instance, indicated that 46% of fraud cases were detected by\nemployee tips, and those organizations with hotlines suffered losses that were\n50% smaller than those that did not offer a hotline.\n\nGust says the use of technology should be one of multiple options provided to\nemployees for reporting wrongdoing (i.e., discuss with supervisor, HR or\nlegal; or use anonymous-reporting tool via web, email or SMS). It should be\nsupported by whistleblower and anti-retaliation policies that clearly\ncommunicate to everyone (including vendors and clients or customers) that the\norganization has a zero-tolerance policy for retaliation against any person\nwho reports unethical or illegal behavior in good faith.\n\n\u201cCompliance is not a glamorous area. It is, however, an area where HR must get\nthings exactly right,\u201d concludes Ceridian\u2019s Malley. \u201cLeadership assumes HR\nwill have this issue perfectly nailed down.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Innovation](/innovation)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nMike Morini\n\nMike Morini is the CEO of [WorkForce\nSoftware](http://www.workforcesoftware.com/), the leading cloud-based\nworkforce management provider for complex, global enterprises.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nToday\u2019s HR leaders have it tough. The first half of 2019 brought with it the[\n](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)[lowest unemployment\nrate](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) we\u2019ve seen since\n[1970](https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet). That\u2019s good news for the\nU.S. economy but a challenge for HR teams fighting to attract, retain, and\nengage a more financially secure, diverse workforce. With the gig economy in\nfull force and [new Department of Labor (DOL) proposals frequently being\nintroduced](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/dols-regulatory-to-do-list-\ntackles-flsa-fmla-and-work-visa-issues/), if the first half of 2019 taught us\nanything it\u2019s that flexibility will be the key to successful workforce\nmanagement across industries. Further, as technology leaders, it\u2019s incumbent\nupon us to find smart ways to alleviate increasing pressure on HR. It\u2019s also\nin our best interest, as hiring decisions and employee engagement strategies\ncan directly impact productivity, agility, and our ability to drive the bottom\nline. As the CEO of a company that offers HR software for functions like\nscheduling, and time and attendance, here are three things I recommend you\nkeep in mind when hiring, managing, and developing talent.\n\n**Prepare to ride the regulatory rollercoaster.**\n\nThe last few months have [brought\n](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-\nlaw/pages/flsa-overtime-rule-resources.aspx)several proposed updates to the\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Back in March, the DOL\nannounced that they would be proposing an\n[increase](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20190307) in the\nsalary threshold that determines which workers are eligible for overtime.\n[Eighteen states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-\nminimum-wage-chart.aspx) went into 2019 with increased minimum wage rates,\nincluding California and Washington. As the House recently [passed\n](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-minimum-wage/house-passes-\nbill-to-raise-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour-idUSKCN1UD2DV)legislation to\nraise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and [two-thirds of\nAmericans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/two-thirds-of-\namericans-favor-raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour/) are in favor of\nthe proposal, companies should plan ahead for wage hikes and prepare to offset\nextra costs.\n\nPredictive scheduling, aka \"fair scheduling\" laws -- something my company's\nsoftware helps with but that companies can also pursue independently -- have\nalso begun to gain traction throughout the U.S. [Employees in New York,\nSeattle and San Francisco](https://www.epi.org/publication/fair-workweek-laws-\nhelp-more-than-1-8-million-workers/) are already feeling the benefits of\nprotection from unpredictable work schedules that, in many cases, can deprive\nworkers of a healthy work-life balance.\n\n**The gig is here to stay.  **\n\nThe gig economy continues to take hold both here in the United States and\nglobally. As of 2016, [over 160 million\nworkers](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-\ngrowth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy) across the\nUnited States and Europe had made the shift to contract work -- meaning that\nthey engaged in some form of independent work -- and that number will likely\ncontinue to grow. A big driver of this trend could be generational, with\nmillennials representing [35%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-\ntank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/) of the U.S.\nworkforce in 2018. As the largest segment of workers in today\u2019s economy, 2016\n[Deloitte\nresearch](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-\nDeloitte/gx-millenial-survey-2016-exec-summary.pdf) found that 16.8% consider\ngood work-life balance the strongest reason to work for an organization, and\n11% rate flexibility the strongest. That means they may be actively seeking\nhourly, contract positions that better fit their lifestyles and, in many\ncases, operate outside the typical 9-to-5 hours of salaried jobs.\n\nUnlike previous generations that may have worked one structured, salaried\nposition with set time off, I've noticed that millennials and Gen Zers\nentering the workforce are tipping the labor market toward hourly and contract\nemployment. These younger generations of employees are breaking the mold of\nsalaried employment and seeking out roles that allow for flexibility, unlike\ntheir counterparts who may be more likely to strive for consistency within\ntheir careers.\n\n**Organizations should** **  continually** **  evolve to succeed.**\n\nChange is constant. And when it comes to regulatory updates, the never-ending\nintroduction of new or updated legislation leaves organizations vulnerable to\ncompliance violations \\-- which can end up [costing\ncompanies](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/screen74.asp) thousands of\ndollars each year.\n\nTo ensure compliance with myriad regulations, companies should have a solid\ngrasp on how and where their workforce is distributed, both nationally and\ninternationally. Understanding individual state regulations as they apply to\nthe FLSA and how your own internal policies align with or extend beyond those\nrules will help ensure that your company is not dinged for non-compliance,\nwhich can lead to hefty penalties and fines. On an international scale,\nregulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation can greatly impact\nthe flow of information across companies, and HR departments should be sure\nthat the right information is being communicated -- and protected -- across\nchannels. ** ** Additionally, organizations should ensure that any adjustments\nmade to comply with regulatory changes are communicated clearly to all\nemployees. Effective change management is essential, which can include\ncompany-wide management trainings around the application of specific\nregulatory changes and updating your employee handbook to include changes to\npolicies related to hiring, onboarding and reporting.\n\nWhen it comes to predictive scheduling policies, providing advance notice of\nschedules to employees is mission-critical for success. Organizations that\nmake a conscious effort to align employee schedules and preferences with\nanticipated business needs can see greater success by ensuring that the right\nresources and employees are available at the right times to boost both the\ncustomer experience and bottom-line profits. Similarly, adjusting\norganizational teams to redistribute resources based on skills and interests\ncan lead to significant gains. I've found that companies whose internal\nculture supports open communication around these issues see the highest gains,\nboth in terms of employee engagement and productivity. As leaders, we\u2019re\nreminded that corporate brand values should be visible \\-- not just on paper,\nbut also in words and actions. To accomplish this, organizations should create\nand nurture effective feedback loops, communicate clearly and often, and relay\nresulting action steps back to the workforce.\n\nI believe success in the back half of 2019 will require companies to strike a\nbalance between the needs of the business and those of its evolving workforce.\nAs the influx of younger generations continues, which could lead to a more\ngig-centric economy, improved transparency and scheduling will likely be\ncrucial. With the changing perceptions around hourly and gig workers,\ncompanies face more pressure than ever to win and retain this new type of\ntalent. Having a connected workforce where employees at every level can\noperate at peak efficiency could be key to navigating regulatory changes,\nengaging an increasingly diverse workforce, and ensuring long-term business\nsuccess.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Mike Morini](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2019/09/mikemorini_avatar_1568212685.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/mikemorini/\n\"Photo of Mike Morini\")\n\n[Mike\nMorini](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/mikemorini/)\n\nMike Morini is the CEO of [WorkForce\nSoftware](http://www.workforcesoftware.com), the leading cloud-based workforce\nmanagement provider for complex, global enterprises.

Which case won?\n\n22 January 2020\n\nby [Mark Shumsky](/Home/Redirect/1935244?mode=author&article_id=885898 \"View\nthis authors biography on their website\")\n\nStacks Law Firm\n\n__ 0 Liked this Article\n\n[![](/images/profile/individual/1935244.jpg)](/Home/Redirect/1935244?mode=author&article_id=885898\n\"View this authors biography on their website\")\n\nTo print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on\nMondaq.com.\n\n## The Facts\n\n### Company introduces site attendance policy with biometric fingerprint\nscanning\n\nA company introduced a biometric fingerprint scanning system as part of its\nnew site attendance policy for all its employees. This measure was intended to\nprovide security, safety and efficiency benefits for the company.\n\nAfter the policy was announced during a floor meeting in October 2017, all\ncompany staff were directed to register their fingerprints over the following\nweek. Once registered, employees would then check in and out of the company's\nwork sites by using scanners provided at the start and finish of each shift.\n\n### Employee refuses to provide fingerprints\n\nOne employee was a casual general hand who had worked at the company for more\nthan three years. In November 2017 he was called in and attended a meeting,\nbut did not provide his fingerprints when asked to do so.\n\nThe following day he met his supervisors, who provided him with further\ninformation about the site attendance policy and the scanning system. They\nprovided reasons for the decision to introduce the scanners and the benefits\nthe system would bring to the company.\n\n### Employee concerns regarding third party access to fingerprint data\n\nThe employee said he was not satisfied that the company could guarantee that\nthird parties would not be able to access the electronically stored\nfingerprint data and there was no guarantee that the biometric information in\nhis prints could not be used by any other persons.\n\nThe employee then wrote to the company, setting out his concerns about privacy\nand his objection to providing his fingerprints. The company responded with\nadditional information about the nature of the fingerprint data collection.\n\nThe company provided the employee with documentation from the suppliers of the\nscanners, which said that the data collected could not be used \"for any other\npurpose other than linking your payroll number to a clock in/out time\".\n\n### Company dismisses employee after discussions and warnings\n\nThe scanners were implemented in January 2018. Meanwhile, the employee\ncontinued to check in and out of work using the sign in and out book.\n\nHe was given a verbal warning and was subsequently warned in writing that if\nhe continued to fail to comply with the policy, it would result in his\nemployment being terminated.\n\nThe employee wrote to the company that he wished to be allowed to keep his\njob, but insisted on retaining ownership of his biometric data. Further\ndiscussions did not result in any resolution.\n\nIn February 2018 a show cause letter was issued to the employee, after which\nhe was dismissed.\n\nThe employee brought an application in the Fair Work Commission for unfair\ndismissal. It was up to the commission to determine whether it was reasonable\nand lawful for the employer to require the employee to provide the biometric\ndata and if so, whether the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.\n\n### case a - The case for the employer\n\n|\n\n### case b - The case for the employee  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Our requirement that employees use biometric fingerprint scanning is lawful, reasonable and practical.\n  * This measure is part of our site attendance policy. It improves safety in the event of an emergency by avoiding the need to locate the paper sign in and out book to ascertain attendance on site.\n  * The site attendance policy formed part of the employee's contract of employment, so he was obliged to comply with its terms.\n  * The biometric data collected by the fingerprint scanners is secure and confidential, as are all employee records.\n  * There was no breach of privacy, due to the exemption in the Privacy Act with respect to employee records.\n  * We have the right to manage our affairs by requiring employees to comply with company policies.\n  * The commission should find that he was not unfairly dismissed.\n\n|\n\n  * My fingerprints and the biometric data they contain constitute \"sensitive information\" according to the Privacy Act. They are my personal and private property.\n  * Employers are not entitled to collect an employee's sensitive information without proper notice and without their consent.\n  * The company did not talk to me or to any other employees about its legal obligations and responsibilities in handling sensitive information.\n  * The company supplying the scanners also failed to provide adequate information about the collection and use of personal and sensitive information in accordance with Australian privacy laws.\n  * Once my personal biometric data is digitised, it could be difficult to contain its use by third parties, including for commercial purposes. I was never told exactly who was likely to have access to this sensitive information.\n  * The Privacy Act exemption does not apply to my records, because the company failed to issue a privacy collection notice as required by the Privacy Act.\n  * It is not true that the fingerprint scanners would improve safety, nor that their introduction was reasonably necessary. The commission should find that I was unfairly dismissed.\n\n  \n  \n# So, which case won?\n\n**Cast your judgment below to find out**  \n  \n---  \n  \n[ Case A \u2714]( https://www.stacklaw.com.au/wcw/if-a-worker-refuses-biometric-\nfingerprint-scanning-is-it-unfair-dismissal-to-sack-them-which-case-\nwon/?choice=A )[ Case B \u2714](https://www.stacklaw.com.au/wcw/if-a-worker-\nrefuses-biometric-fingerprint-scanning-is-it-unfair-dismissal-to-sack-them-\nwhich-case-won/?choice=B )\n\n[ Mark\nShumsky](/redirection.asp?article_id=885898&company_id=24376&redirectaddress=http%3A//www.stacklaw.com.au/people/mark-\nshumsky/)\n\n[ Employment\nlaw](/redirection.asp?article_id=885898&company_id=24376&redirectaddress=http%3A//https://www.stacklaw.com.au/people/mark-\nshumsky/)\n\n[ Stacks Collins\nThompson](/redirection.asp?article_id=885898&company_id=24376&redirectaddress=http%3A//www.stacklaw.com.au/location/hornsby/)\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Adopt These Cutting-edge Recruitment Software Innovations**\n  * **Choosing Wisely in a Crowded Digital Marketplace**\n\n## **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n\nRecruitment technology is defined as a set of tools used to automate the\nhiring process, connecting with a variety of data sources to access the best\nquality candidates. It performs key functions such as screening applicants,\nstreamlining follow-ups, and providing data on the efficiency of your\nrecruitment model.\n\nOver the last few years, the demand for recruitment software and tools has\nshot up dramatically as the labor market becomes fiercer and more complicated.\nCompanies are eager to hire highly skilled workers and drive business\ninnovation, even as the average tenure per employee continues to dip. In fact,\nglobal market research company Fortune Business Insights finds that the\nrecruitment software market will cross $3,000 million by 2025.\n\nInterestingly, recruitment doesn\u2019t always need to be a technology-driven\nprocess. However, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality talent that makes an\nexcellent culture fit, especially during a rapid growth phase, you will\nrequire recruitment software to achieve the right level of efficiency.\n\nRecruitment software doesn\u2019t just help you complete the formalities around\nhiring a candidate. It automates the entire recruitment pipeline right from\ncandidate sourcing and engagement to the final step of onboarding. That\u2019s why\nit has become a staple for the **[modern HR\ntoolkit](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/hr-\ntoolkit-of-the-future/)**.\n\n## **Four Features of Recruitment Software That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n\nGiven the highly crowded nature of the recruitment software marketplace, how\ndo you go about choosing one best suited to your enterprise? Are you aware of\nall the must-have features in any recruitment platform, and future trends in\nthis space?\n\nHere are a few key features that your recruitment software and tools should be\nable to perform:\n\n### **1\\. Plugging into a variety of data sources**\n\n  \nThe recruitment tool of your choice should be able to **integrate with the\nhighest possible number of data sources** , including social media, email, job\nboards, third-party staffing platforms, and several other **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** areas. It should also come with the requisite sort-and-\nfilter capabilities to help find the right talent.\n\n### **2\\. Deploying recruitment marketing initiatives**\n\n  \nToday, attracting and retaining candidates closely resembles the process of\nattracting and retaining consumers. That\u2019s why it is a recruitment best\npractice to **approach the hiring process as a sales and marketing campaign**.\n\nRemember to check if a recruitment software supports email automation, job ads\npublishing, video communication, **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** (CRM), and in-app\nmessaging to engage with applicants across the entire hiring journey.\n\n### **3\\. Shortlisting candidate profiles**\n\n  \nWith so many recommendations and leads flowing in from multiple sources, it\ncould be challenging to arrive at **an actionable list of candidates** \u2013 and\nthis is particularly true for bulk-hiring campaigns.\n\nRecruitment software should be able to build a searchable database of\napplicants, perform level-one resume screening, enable multi-channel\ncommunication within the platform, and aid your end-to-end selection process.\n\n### **4\\. Revealing insights into recruitment efficiency**\n\n  \nThis is one of the most significant advantages of using an analytics-driven\nrecruitment software versus legacy manual processes. The tool should be able\nto gather data across the recruitment pipeline to **extract useful insights,**\nsuch as which sourcing strategy is performing the best, whether your\ntime/cost-to-hire is sustainable, and key pain points in the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\nOver time, this feature will ensure your recruitment function becomes smarter,\nmore effective, and ready to stand out in a competitive hiring arena.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at the core features of recruitment software, let's turn\nthe spotlight on some of the most prominent players in this space and a few\ndisruptors that are making game-changing strides in recruitment software\ntechnology.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n## **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n\nAs technology evolves in leaps and bounds, powerful software and cutting-edge\ninnovation aren\u2019t limited to large enterprises anymore. For example, Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) has made it possible to deploy recruitment tools on a pay-\nper-use model, scaling up or down as necessary. APIs also enable easier\nintegrations without any complex back-end development.\n\nAs a result, our list of the best recruitment software for 2020 is a mix of\nenterprise-grade tools as well as smartly designed products for small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). We have tried to cover the varying needs of\nbusinesses of multiple sizes, and every software has excellent online customer\nreviews. Remember, the best recruitment software for you will depend on your\nunique business requirements \u2013 that\u2019s why the numbering on this list doesn\u2019t\nreflect the ranking of a particular recruitment tool.\n\n![The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and\nbeyond](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and beyond**\n\n### **1\\. Ascendify: With the power of predictive intelligence**\n\n  \nAscendify is a talent acquisition software that is powered by state-of-the-art\npredictive analytics, which lets you build deeper relationships with\ncandidates.

It empowers employees to give and receive feedback on\ntheir own terms, set up regular check-ins with their line manager, manage\ntheir goals and develop their career plan.\n\nAppraisd was founded by Roly Walter in his spider-infested garden shed. He had\nstarted his career as a business analyst at Goldman Sachs designing global\nonline HR tools, and it was that experience that inspired him to design and\nlaunch Appraisd, which now has hundreds of customers all over the world.

Clients\ninclude Jobsite, as well as other sectors where search is an important part of\nthe process, such as Rightmove and Zoopla.\n\nLast May iGeolise, the creators of the TravelTime platform, announced a \u00a33.2\nmillion ($4.1 million) funding from ETF Partners.\n\n**Intrro**\n\nEmployee referrals are one of the most effective ways of hiring new people, as\nthey tend to get hired faster and stay in their jobs for longer.\n[Intrro](https://www.intrro.com/ \"https://www.intrro.com/\") makes it easier\nfor companies to connect with qualified candidates in their employee\u2019s social\nand professional networks. The employee referral platform uses machine\nlearning to automatically match the relevant talent to open positions,\nenabling employees to reach out to their contacts to let them know about the\njob opening.\n\nInstead of getting another unsolicited recruiting message from a stranger,\nrelevant candidates receive a personalized message from their contact. If they\nare interested they can directly respond to the recruiter, who can take it\nfrom there.\n\nIntrro also enables recruiters to browse their employee's contacts against\nopen positions, and proactively ask for an intro, allowing them to spend more\ntime speaking to receptive candidates and less time chasing leads, whilst\ngiving hiring managers access to a broader, verified and more diverse pool of\ntalent.\n\nFounded by Neel Jamie Shah and Nasser Oudjidane in 2018, the company has\nsecured $500,000 from a range of investors, including 500 Startups, Spartech\nVentures, plus strategic angel investors such as Saif Kidwai, founder of\nDigital Gurus, a specialist recruitment technology consultancy.\n\n**Personio**\n\nHeadquartered in Munich, Germany, [Personio](https://www.personio.com/\n\"https://www.personio.com/\") is a HR, recruiting and payroll platform that is\nalready digitising the HR departments of almost 2,000 SME customers in more\nthan 40 countries.\n\nFounded in 2015 by CEO Hanno Renner, Roman Schumacher, Arseniy Vershinin and\nIgnaz Forstmeier, the company recently expanded into in the U.K.\n\nThe innovative SaaS solution combines HR core features in one digital tool,\nenabling HR managers and business leaders to manage things like attendance\ndata, absences, and salaries consistently.\n\nPersonio recently announced its latest series C funding round of $75 million,\nbringing the total investment secured to $130 million.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@alisonbcoleman) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisoncolemanfreelance/).

work\nenvironment](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/inclusive_work_environment_5dcab47acc46d.png)\n\n_**The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world,\nincluding the human resources (HR) domain. Let\u2019s take a closer look at its\nimpact, writes Suresh Sambandam, CEO, Kissflow**_\n\n## **The impact of AI on modern work environments**\n\nIt is not hard to find examples of how AI has transformed entire industries,\nfrom automating many parts of the car manufacturing industry to allowing\nautomatic decision-making based on pre-set criteria in the stock market.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nIn fact, a recent study by IBM found that 76% of operations executives felt\nthat increasing automation would have a positive impact on operational\nefficiency (IBM Corporation, 2017). This reflects the widely held view that AI\nmust work hand-in-hand with human intelligence and skills for maximum benefit.\n\nThe HR function itself is no stranger to AI. In general, the HR function has\nembraced the benefits of software to automate labor-intensive [HR\nprocesses](https://kissflow.com/hr-process/top-7-hr-process-you-should-\nautomate%E2%80%8B) within the employee lifecycle. Examples include time and\nattendance tracking and payroll processing, which many companies have\nautomated for a couple of decades.\n\nBut it is only more recently that organizations are recognizing the\nopportunities to invest in AI to further their company\u2019s HR strategy.\nCombining AI with irreplaceable employee skills and experience can offer\norganizations a competitive advantage in a crammed marketplace. A great\nexample of this is in the field of diversity and inclusion, and using\ntechnology to reduce the likelihood of bias or discrimination in an\norganization.\n\n**Learn more:[A Case for Caution with AI in Talent Acquisition and Our Fight\nfor Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/a-case-for-caution-for-ai-in-talent-acquisition-and-our-fight-\nfor-diversity-and-inclusion/)**\n\n## **The case for an inclusive working environment**\n\nBefore we consider how AI has the potential to promote a more inclusive work\nenvironment, let\u2019s discover why it matters so much.\n\nThe organizations of today\u2019s modern world operate in a global environment. No\nlonger confined to a marketplace within their geographical area, the world is\ntheir oyster in terms of engaging with new markets and potential customers,\nthanks to the internet and faster, more reliable air travel. As a result,\nsmart businesses must embrace the creation of a multi-dimensional workforce\nthat reflects the makeup of its markets in terms of gender, race, age, sexual\norientation, and other characteristics. It is quite simply the right thing to\ndo\u2014offering opportunities to individuals based purely on merit, skill, and\nhard work.\n\nOf course, there is a regulatory aspect as well\u2014many countries operate laws\nrelating to diversity, and therefore, an organization that can demonstrate\ntheir commitment to the issues confidently will ensure compliance in this\narea.\n\n## **Specific ways AI can promote inclusion**\n\nTechnology has a vitally important role to play in advancing the diversity\nagenda in an organization. One of the highest impact ways is ensuring an\ninclusive approach to recruitment.\n\nHuman bias can take different forms, whether intentional or unintentional.\nThis can have devastating effects on the inclusivity of the recruitment\nprocess. AI can help enormously with this, by implementing consistent and fair\nassessment and screening criteria using simple keyword technology to ensure\nthat candidates are shortlisted based on their skills and experience only.\n\nTechnology can also help job advertisements to appeal to a wide demographic of\npotential employees by looking at response history data, and subsequently\nwriting job descriptions that are inclusive and appeal to a diverse range of\napplicants.\n\n## **Through the looking glass: the future of an inclusive workplace**\n\nWe have come a long way in terms of embracing how AI can partner with human\ncapital to make tangible efficiency gains throughout the workplace. But there\nare so many opportunities to take this further in the future. For example,\nwork is underway to extend the use of technology that removes user bias when\nprocessing payroll or using performance appraisal matrices.\n\nAI also has the potential to use historical data within HR software systems to\ncreate profiles based on culture, using leadership and communication styles\nand giving organizations insights to help them create more inclusive and\nbetter-informed policies and [HR processes](https://kissflow.com/hr-\nprocess/top-7-hr-process-you-should-automate).\n\nAI within the workplace is not only here to stay, but is set to accelerate the\npace of change across organizations and industries as a whole. It is how it\nworks in partnership with the other part of the puzzle, human skill and\nintelligence, that will determine how successful it will be in reality.\n\n**Learn more:[3 Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) will Transform\nRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/3-ways-ai-will-transform-recruitment/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fcombining-human-and-artificial-intelligence-for-a-more-\ninclusive-work-\nenvironment%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Combining+Human+and+Artificial+Intelligence+for+a+More+Inclusive+Work+Environment\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Combining+Human+and+Artificial+Intelligence+for+a+More+Inclusive+Work+Environment&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fcombining-human-and-artificial-intelligence-for-a-more-\ninclusive-work-\nenvironment%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fcombining-human-and-artificial-intelligence-for-a-more-\ninclusive-work-\nenvironment%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fcombining-human-and-artificial-intelligence-for-a-more-\ninclusive-work-\nenvironment%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Combining Human and Artificial Intelligence\nfor a More Inclusive Work\nEnvironment&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fcombining-human-and-artificial-intelligence-for-a-more-\ninclusive-work-\nenvironment%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

2019\n\n![](https://msdynamicsworld.com/sites/default/files/talent-core-hr-\nicon.png)Microsoft has acquired the rights to advanced HR tools from two\nvendors, FourVision and Elevate HR, for use as part of the core HR module\nwithin Dynamics 365 Talent.\n\nThe new capabilities cover leave and absence, time and attendance, and\nbenefits, according to an\n[announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-\ninvestments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence/) from Dynamics 365\ngeneral manager Muhammad Alam.\n\nThe core HR capabilities (previously referred to as \"core HCM\") within\nDynamics 365 Talent work against the Common Data Service and are designed to\nintegrate with Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management\n(formerly Finance and Operations). [Talent also offers modular\napps](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-\ndynamics-365-recruiting-onboarding-apps-building-out-modular-approach) like\nOnboard and the LinkedIn Recruiter-integrated\n[Attract](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-dynamics-365-talent-\nattract-app-fully-integrated-linkedin-recruiter) (other apps have been\npreviewed, like\n[Gauge](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/dynamics-365/microsoft-\ndynamics-365-talent-adds-tech-preview-gauge-online-skills-assessment)).\n\nAlam emphasized that Microsoft customers are adding Talent's core HR\ncapabilities to their Dynamics 365 ERP solutions. He stated that the \"usage\"\nof Talent's core HR capabilities is doubling every six months.\n\nDynamics 365 for Talent core HR will be adding FourVision's leave and absence,\nsickness management, and timesheet capabilities.\n\n### FREE Membership Required to View Full Content:\n\n[Become a\nMember](/user/register?msg=1&destination=node/28074)[Login](/user/login?destination=node/28074)\n\nJoining MSDynamicsWorld.com gives you **free, unlimited access** to news,\nanalysis, white papers, case studies, product brochures, and more.

Sometime in October\n2017, it was brought to the attention of the company's management that the\nclaimant had punched in the Attendance Record Card of another employee (\"\n**Employee** \") who is also his neighbour. Upon further investigation, the\ncompany discovered that the claimant had falsified the Attendance Record Card\nof the Employee for the months of July and August 2017, i.e. the working hours\nscribbled on the Employee's Attendance Record Cards did not reflect the actual\nhours worked by the Employee.\n\nAccordingly, the company issued a Domestic lnquiry Notice for the claimant to\ndefend himself, to which he pleaded guilty to two of the three charges\nlevelled against him at the domestic inquiry hearing. Upon concluding that the\nclaimant was guilty of all three charges against him, the company terminated\nthe claimant's employment with immediate effect in January 2018.\n\nln dismissing the claimant's claim for unfair dismissal, the lndustrial Court\nheld, _inter alia_ , that:\n\n  1. Although the court was unable to accept the accuracy of the Domestic lnquiry notes in the absence of the signatures of the Domestic lnquiry chairman and secretary and there were irregularities in the domestic inquiry hearing, those irregularities were curable by _de_ _novo_ proceedings before the court;\n  2. lt is clear from the evidence that the claimant had enriched his neighbour by falsifying the working hours of the latter despite being fully aware of the company's rules and regulations;\n  3. lt is trite law that the act of falsifying the working hours of an employee is a serious misconduct that goes against the fundamental relationship of trust and confidence between employer and employee; and\n  4. Based on the claimant's disciplinary record, the court found that he was a habitual offender and his long years of service did not immunise him from dismissal, especially when allowing him to continue in service would be detrimental to the discipline or security of the company.\n\nThe company was represented by partner Shariffullah Majeed and associate\nArissa Ahrom of Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill.\n\n_This article is reproduced, with permission, from LHAG update (date of\nissue), a bulletin issued by Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill, Advocates &\nSolicitors, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia._\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

How does it differ from what we\nunderstand as traditional HR? And what are the implications of these\ndifferences? Read on to find out.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Building a Workforce to Achieve Organizational\nGoals**\n\nBoiled down to its essence, talent management is your organization\u2019s strategy\nfor attracting, recruiting, retaining, and developing people. Seriously,\nthat\u2019s it.\n\nOf course, what sounds really simple on the surface is actually incredibly\ncomplex. Everything from recruiting and onboarding, to compensation,\nperformance, and employee training is part of talent management. Making\nmatters worse, there is no blueprint for talent management success. The talent\nmanagement strategy that works for a local diner won\u2019t work for a global IT\nfirm.\n\nNonetheless, the concept is always the same: Create a strategy for the success\nof the organization, then find and keep the best people to execute on that\nstrategy. That\u2019s talent management.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Not an Alternative to HR**\n\nPerhaps the biggest misconception I see about talent management is that it is\nan evolution of HR or an alternative approach to HR for modern times, like a\nfad diet or a new workout program. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nTalent management is just one increasingly important category of HR, but one\nthat has always been there, existing alongside three other categories: HR\nadministration, HR service delivery, and workforce management. Here\u2019s how they\nbreak down:\n\n  * **HR administration covers your traditional, back-office HR responsibilities.** This includes things like payroll and benefits administration, but also compliance, safety, and grievance tracking.  \n\n  * **HR service delivery is how you deliver information to workers.** Alongside ongoing case, document, and knowledgebase management, this category of responsibilities also includes maintaining HR channels, like the HRIS or the company intranet.  \n\n  * **Talent management is how you grow and maintain a competitive workforce.** It touches on any process pertaining to the attraction, recruitment, retention, or development of people.  \n\n  * **Workforce management is the optimization of talent resources.** Budgeting and forecasting fall here, but so does anything pertaining to scheduling and time and attendance.  \n\nAs it has become harder and harder to find and keep top talent, and as more\nbusinesses have prioritized their people as their most important competitive\nasset, it was inevitable that talent management would eventually garner the\nmost attention and focus on these categories.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say those other categories aren\u2019t important. But if your HR\ndepartment is still operating in a largely back-office role and struggling\nwith talent management (looking at you, small businesses), it\u2019s time to\nrethink your approach.\n\n**Learn More:[What Is Candidate Management? Definition, Relationship\nManagement, and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)**\n\n## **3 Ways Talent Management Requires a Different Approach**\n\nTransitioning from a back-office role based on compliance to a seat at the\nleadership table-based around strategy isn\u2019t easy for an HR department. But\nwith [83% of HR\nleaders](https://content.randstadsourceright.com/hubfs/Global%20campaign/TTR/2019/report/Randstad-\nSourceright-2019-Talent-Trends-Report-190118.pdf) aiming to make a measurable\nimpact on business performance through their talent management strategy, it\u2019s\nnever been more important to make this shift if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nHere are three ways talent management requires a different approach:\n\n  1. **It takes a village**. Traditional HR is a largely siloed endeavor, but talent management is the opposite. Your CEO, your various department heads, and your IT team all play a role in talent management, which may require you to flatten your org structure or hire a chief people officer dedicated to talent management to close the distance between all of the stakeholders.  \n\n  2. **It requires thinking long-term**. Talent management requires asking big questions that don\u2019t have easy answers. How are you going to attract the best job seekers? How are you going to train people and help them grow? You won\u2019t be able to answer these questions in a week or even a month. Determine metrics for success, test different approaches, and, most importantly, be patient.  \n\n  3. **It needs updated technology.** Your core HR system can handle those day-to-day compliance needs, but what about your talent management needs? A talent management system provides more robust functionality to track data for everything from recruiting to performance management, employee engagement, succession planning, and more\u2014data that is vital to testing and making talent management decisions. These systems also automate a lot of rote tasks, like onboarding, so you can focus more time on that all-important strategy.\n\n  \nYour strategy should inform your technology needs, not the other way around.\nIf your current stack doesn\u2019t support your vision, it\u2019s time for an upgrade.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Here to Stay**\n\nIn HR, we\u2019re used to trends crashing down on us as the \u201cnext big thing,\u201d only\nto be replaced by the next \u201cnext big thing\u201d a few years later. For example,\nall the hype over employee productivity was overtaken by employee engagement,\nthen the employee experience. And remember all the fuss about blockchain?\n\nTalent management, on the other hand, is not fading away. It\u2019s the holistic\npeople strategy that will dictate the success of your business forever, and\nwill only make its impact more felt during the difficult times. If you\u2019ve yet\nto sit down with your stakeholders and map out a combination of structure,\nprocess, strategy, and technology to succeed at talent management, 2020 is the\nyear to start.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Best Talent Management Strategies for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/5-best-\ntalent-management-strategies-for-2020/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Determining+the+Difference+Between+Talent+Management+and+HR\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Determining+the+Difference+Between+Talent+Management+and+HR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Determining the Difference Between Talent\nManagement and\nHR&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.
