Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nBusiness intelligence and analytics go hand in hand. By leveraging big data,\ncompanies have managed to make more efficient systems, develop better customer\nexperience and create more opportunities to increase their bottom line.\n\nOne of the more overlooked applications of big data is the generation of\ninsights for HR teams. However, companies are coming around to the reality\nthat skillful use of analytics can help their HR teams be more effective in\nfinding and onboarding talent. These 11 experts from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) delve into what their companies have\ndone to implement workforce analytics to help their HR departments be more in\ntune with the organization\u2019s employees.\n\nMembers explain why HR teams can benefit from studying their workforce\nanalytics.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Tracking Employee Engagement** ** **\n\nOur company uses a platform called Rhonda. Rhonda allows us to check in weekly\nwith our employees via text messages. Employees are able to rate their weekly\nexperiences. The managers are held accountable to check in with employees if\nthe employee scores low on their weekly work experience. It is invaluable to\nhave information in real time, open a dialogue and stop problems before they\nblossom. - [Patricia Sharkey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciasharkey/),[\nIMI People](http://www.imipeople.com/)\n\n**2\\. Measuring The Impact Of Learning**\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of training programs has always been a challenge.\nWe know[ 96% of L&D managers](https://leolearning.com/app/uploads/2019/02/LEO-\nLearning-Measuring-the-Business-Impact-Of-Learning-2019-Results.pdf) say they\nwant to measure learning impact, it\u2019s just that L&D and HR simply haven\u2019t had\naccess to the data to do it until now. Today, it\u2019s finally possible with the\nright technology, like machine learning, to gather the depth and dimension of\ndata to tie the impact of learning to business results. - [Andrea\nVrbanac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-vrbanac-chrl-2861ba53/),[ Axonify\nInc](http://www.axonify.com/)\n\n**3\\. Identifying The Optimal Path Forward**\n\nWith talent and organization high on the C-suite's agenda, using metrics and\ndashboards produced by organizational analytics enables HR leaders to be more\nresponsive to the business. It also allows them to deploy internal human\ncapital consulting teams whose members can be flexibly assigned to critical\nprojects that affect that business's organizational health. -[ Claudy\nJules](https://twitter.com/claudy-jules-ph-d-7939a3108),[\nGoogle](http://google.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Preventing Workplace Misconduct**\n\nInvestigations and employee behavioral data can hold the key to anticipating\nand fighting issues like sexual harassment and bias. Indicators on where\nemployee issues are occurring, what kind of issues are being reported, the\nnumbers of cases and more can be analyzed to predict trends, drive strategic\nplans and take preventative action across an organization. - [Deborah\nMuller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiemuller/),[ HR\nAcuity](http://www.hracuity.com/)\n\n**5\\. Identifying Red Flags**\n\nIf you collect data on a consistent basis (e.g. monthly people reviews) and\nask the right questions of your people managers, you will be able to identify\nred flags. This will help determine if you have employees who are struggling,\nflight risks or negatively impacting the team. - [Jeff\nBuenrostro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbuenrostro/),[ Metric\nTheory](http://www.metrictheory.com/)\n\n**6\\. Determining The Right Employee Benefits**\n\nOne area where workforce analytics really shine is the area of employee\nbenefits, employers' second largest expense after payroll. Understanding the\nutilization trends and correlating them with the employee churn data can help\nprovide insights into what benefits employees resonate with the most and\nallows employers to adjust toward more optimal experience to drive employee\nrecruitment and retention. -[ Rachel\nLyubovitzky](https://twitter.com/rlyubovitzky),[\nEverythingBenefits](http://www.everythingbenefits.com/)\n\n**7\\. Addressing Knowledge Gaps**\n\nWhen properly leveraging the power of people analytics, big data can help with\ninternal resource allocation, properly identify employee performance metrics,\nand assist with organizational and team culture. Addressing process\nbottlenecks or knowledge gaps that lead to employee disengagement, burnout and\nturnover can help HR teams build a stronger culture while creating lasting\nvalue. - [Erald Minga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eraldminga/), [Kellogg\nSchool of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)\n\n**8\\. Determining Upskilling Needs**\n\nMany employers struggle to find workers who possess the skills their roles\nrequire, resulting in unfilled positions and lost revenue. By leveraging big\ndata, employers can determine the roles their growing business will require in\nthe near future, and the skills necessary to succeed in those roles, allowing\nthem to offer training to current employees in advance and minimize future\nhiring costs. -[ John Feldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**9\\. Becoming Better Business Partners**\n\nWorkforce analytics can help HR become true business partners and gain a \"seat\nat the table.\" It allows HR to align data with people solutions that will help\nthe company thrive because better people strategies equal greater customer\nsatisfaction and higher revenues. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n**10\\. Improving Process Efficiency**\n\nHR wears many hats, and executives can't always see the connection between\nprograms. Utilizing metrics helps drive stronger performance, show ROI and get\nfurther buy-in for ongoing programs. Let's take process efficiency metrics for\nexample. Look at each step in the hiring process to determine what's broken,\nwhat pages are applicants dropping off, and then use that data to improve\ncompletion rate. -[ Nicole Smartt Serres](https://twitter.com/Nicole_Smartt),[\nStar Staffing](http://www.starhr.com/)\n\n**11\\. Helping Build High-Performing Organizations**\n\nIn a workday, there are myriad touch points between ourselves, others,\nfacilities, etc., which helps understand how we interact within the workplace\nand enables us to tailor better experiences. Data helps solve everyday\nproblems about engagement, hiring or behaviors/shifts in culture. Benefits\ninclude environments in which people can thrive and more effective, high-\nperforming organizations. - [Drew\nCarter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewc/),[ H.

It\u2019s the base of\ncommunication for every culture and every society. Stories are a familiar way\nof sharing and a common language of connection. Using a narrative is, in\nshort, the ideal way to get your point across.\n\nWhen executed well, storytelling can give us a compelling reason to change our\nbehavior. In marketing, stories help to build trust or highlight the human\nelement of a product or service. For a human resource (HR) department, telling\na story connects an abstract employee benefit to a real human experience in a\nway bulleted emails and benefits booklets never could.\n\nWhen developing an employee benefits package, HR departments typically try to\nadd point solutions in order to lower their healthcare costs. These solutions\ncan be amazing at redirecting care from expensive services like the emergency\nroom. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve found that they are historically hampered by low\nutilization. Storytelling can turn this trend around.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on telemedicine, a program we offer at HealthJoy. A brochure on\nthis benefit might talk about how your employees have access to an online\nmedical provider 24/7. Good info. It might list everything that you can treat\nthrough a virtual doctor visit. That\u2019s helpful. It might even talk about the\ncredentials of the doctors on staff. Maybe that will convince potential users.\n\nUnfortunately, this bulleted list does little to strike an emotional chord \u2014\nand that means it\u2019s likely to be forgotten. I find employees are far more\nlikely to remember stories than a list of features. If your goal is to\nincrease utilization, you want to lodge telemedicine benefit details in your\nemployees\u2019 brains. For that, you need to start by telling a story.\n\nA favorite story of mine related to telemedicine comes from one of our\nmembers. She\u2019s had asthma her whole life and knows that without her inhaler,\nan asthma attack can be fatal. She\u2019s always aware of this, so she\u2019s always\nmade a point of keeping her inhaler refilled. Yet life sometimes gets in the\nway of our best intentions. Years before she was our member, she started\ngetting symptoms in the middle of the night and realized she had run out of\nher inhaler. Given the late hour, she felt she only had one option to get her\nprescription refilled: She went to the emergency room.\n\nThis cost her $1,000 in out-of-pocket spending, and her company likely paid\nover $2,000 to get a simple prescription. But she shared another story with\nus, as well. Years later, when she had access to our telemedicine service, she\nfell into the same situation again. This time, she remembered that she could\ntalk to an online medical professional in an instant and get a prescription\nsent to her local pharmacy within minutes. It was quick and efficient. In the\nend, it saved her a boatload of money.\n\nI\u2019ve written this story in marketing materials using a classic storytelling\narc, the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d (also called a monomyth). Basically, the hero goes\non a difficult journey into the unknown. After overcoming an obstacle, they\nreturn home with newfound wisdom or a reward. Some of our most familiar\nstories like _The Hobbit_ , _Harry Potter_ and _Star Wars_ were built around\nthis story arc. If it\u2019s good enough for Tolkien, Rowling and Lucas, I figure\nit\u2019s good enough to share our story.\n\nThere are a lot of storytelling frameworks you can use to build compelling HR\nstories. A few classic story structures include:\n\n**\u2022 The Mountain:** It\u2019s common to see this story structure on TV, with an\nintroduction, buildup, problem, resolution and ending within a TV season or\neven a single episode.\n\n**\u2022 Sparklines:**  Here, you\u2019ll cycle between hope and reality several times.\nIt\u2019s a great way to spark emotion in your readers by building tension.\n\n**\u2022 In Medias Res:** Meaning \u201cin the midst of things.\u201d With this technique,\nyou begin in the heart of the action and explain how you got there afterward.\nIn the case of our telemedicine story, maybe you would start the story at the\nhospital.\n\n**\u2022 The False Start:** In this structure, you start with what seems like a\npredictable story and disrupt it abruptly, restarting from the beginning. When\nyou\u2019re sharing stories about healthcare and benefits, this technique can\nreally come in handy, because these sudden changes are a part of life.\n\nOf course, there are many other storytelling structures out there. These\ncreate a great scaffolding to begin building a compelling story around\nemployee benefits.\n\nTo get started, consider some of your best employee feedback about the\nbenefits you\u2019d like to highlight. Then think of how you can write those\nstories using one of the above structures. Remember, your HR and employee\nbenefits stories don\u2019t have to be boring. After all, we are dealing with life-\nand-death situations.\n\nUnlock those stories, and share them with your employees. You\u2019ll capture their\nhearts and minds while helping them remember essential details about their\nbenefits. When it comes time to make critical decisions about their health,\nthey\u2019ll easily recall the details you shared in the common language of\nstories.\n\n[Forbes Communications\nCouncil](http://www.forbescommcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media\nstrategy, creative and advertising agencies. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbescommcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Rick Ramos](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbescommunicationscouncil/files/2020/02/rickramos1_avatar_1582831114.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/people/rickramos1/\n\"Photo of Rick Ramos\")\n\n[Rick\nRamos](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/people/rickramos1/)\n\nChief Marketing Officer at [HealthJoy](https://healthjoy.com/), a benefits\nexperience platform helping employees make smarter healthcare decisions.

furlough employees\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 7 202011:13 PM EDTUpdated 2 hours ago\n\n[Lora Kolodny](https://www.cnbc.com/lora-\nkolodny/)[@lorakolodny](https://twitter.com/@lorakolodny)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Tesla will cut all salaried employees' pay and will furlough hourly workers after health orders to curb COVID-19 have forced it to suspend new vehicle production. \n  * According to an e-mail sent to all employees, the company expects to resume production at its Fremont, California car plant on May 4. \n  * The pay reductions are expected to be in place until the end of the second quarter.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Office Elon Musk speaks at his company's factory in\nFremont, California.\n\nNoah Berger | Reuters\n\n[Tesla](/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) will cut pay for all of its salaried employees\nand will furlough hourly workers until May 4, when it intends to resume\nproduction of electric cars, according to an internal e-mail that multiple\nemployees shared with CNBC. The pay reductions are expected to be in place\nuntil the end of the second quarter.\n\n[Health orders](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/tesla-temporarily-suspending-\nproduction-at-bay-area-factory-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html), implemented to\ncurb the spread of COVID-19, forced Elon Musk's electric car company to wind\ndown production at its main vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.\n\nThe new pay cuts follow [Tesla's first-quarter vehicle production and\ndeliveries report](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/tesla-\ntsla-1q-2020-production-and-delivery-numbers.html), which pleased investors \u2014\nthe company said it delivered approximately 88,400 vehicles and produced\n103,000 in Q1. Tesla has yet to withdraw guidance it gave investors for 2020,\nsaying it should \"comfortably exceed\" 500,000 vehicle deliveries for the year.\n\nLast week, Tesla informed staffing agencies that it would be ceasing all\ncontract work until further notice. Hundreds of temps were dismissed from\ntheir Tesla gigs as a result.\n\nHere is the full email sent by the company's head of North American HR,\nValerie Workman, on Tuesday evening:\n\n _Hi Everyone,_\n\n _Thank you for your continued commitment to Tesla and our mission during this\nunprecedented time. We know that the uncertainty has not been easy, and we are\ndoing everything we can to keep you safe and informed while also navigating\nthe changes around the world._\n\n _While we are continuing to keep only minimum critical operations running, we\nexpect to resume normal production at our U.S. facilities on May 4, barring\nany significant changes. Until that time, it is important we take action to\nensure we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans._\n\n _Starting Monday, April 13, we are implementing the below actions as part of\na broader effort to manage costs. This is a shared sacrifice across the\ncompany that will allow us to progress during these challenging times._\n\n _Pay will be temporarily reduced for salaried employees._\n\n  *  _For U.S. employees, these reductions are 30% for Vice Presidents and above, 20% for Directors and above, and 10% for everyone else._\n  *  _For non-U.S. employees, there will also be comparable reductions, of which the specifics will be communicated by the local leadership team in accordance with local laws and works-councils._\n  *  _These reductions are expected to be in place until the end of Q2_\n\n _Employees who cannot work at home and have not been assigned to critical\nwork onsite will be furloughed._\n\n  *  _Under furlough, you remain an employee of Tesla (without pay) and retain your healthcare benefits. You will not report to work until the furlough ends and you are directed to return by management, which we expect to be May 4._\n  *  _A furlough notice will be emailed to you in the coming days with additional instructions on how to apply for unemployment benefits through your state agency._\n  *  _For the vast majority of furloughed employees, unemployment benefits will be roughly equivalent to normal take home pay._\n  *  _Certain employees will be assigned to critical functions and they will continue to report onsite. Those employees will be communicated to directly by their manager or HR partner._\n\n _For the merit review cycle:_\n\n  *  _Salary and hourly rate adjustments will be put on hold._\n  *  _Equity grants will be on hold as well._\n\n _If you would like to take a voluntary leave of absence, as some have reached\nout to request, please discuss with your manager and HR partner._\n\n _We continue to monitor the situation closely, and our top priority is to\nensure the safety of our employees. As usual, for those who are onsite, if you\nare sick or are uncomfortable coming to work, please contact your manager and\nstay at home._\n\n _We respect your decision and you will not be penalized. For HR-related\nquestions, contact your HR partner or email [address redacted]_\n\n _Thank you all so very much for everything you do to ensure the success of\nour company.  \n_\n\n _Valerie Capers

the [coronavirus pandemic](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)\nchanges workplaces all over the country, employees find themselves stressed\nout about their new reality, questioning their health coverage, financial\nsecurity, job security and much more.\n\nAs a result, smart employers are reevaluating policies and offerings, putting\na spotlight on employee benefits in a way that is more needed than ever,\nexperts say.\n\n\u201cWhat we are finding is that employers are looking at their benefits packages\nto ensure they know everything offered to employees in detail, so that they\nare ready to answer the influx of questions employees are having,\u201d says Bill\nGimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Benefits, a national insurance and employee\nbenefits brokerage firm.\n\n\u201cEmployers need to be assessing their short-term disability, paid-time off\npolicies, layoff provisions and medical coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cMore than\nanything, right now employers are making sure that their employees are safe\nand healthy.\u201d\n\nPerks that are already part of an employers\u2019 benefits package should be\nactively communicated to employees now to address their concerns. Others can\nbe expanded or added in the wake of the country\u2019s crisis.\n\nHere are 8 benefits employers should zero in on in wake of the coronavirus\npandemic.\n\n[**Healthcare benefits = >**](http://hrexecutive.com/healthcare-benefits-\ncoronavirus/)\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference.

new era for employee benefits. A tightened job market, higher employee\nexpectations and a diverse workforce are causing a shift in the offerings that\nworkers want\u2014and employers provide. While table-stakes benefits like health\ninsurance and retirement accounts are still among the most important and high-\nvalue offerings, the workplace shift is putting the onus on HR leaders to go\nfurther in their efforts.\n\n\u201cLow unemployment, more choice in benefits and societal changes have a huge\nimpact on employee expectations about what they want\u2014both from their workplace\nand their career more broadly,\u201d says Kimberly Bowen, vice president of talent\nmanagement at Unum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter a range of high-value benefits that are helping employers better attract\nand retain talent, improve the wellbeing of their employees and get the most\nvalue for their money.\n\nAlthough 2020 is seeing an influx of vital perks, here are 10 of the most\nimpactful benefits that offer employers the most bang for their buck,\naccording to _HRE_ editors and industry experts.\n\n_*Editor 's note: This feature was written for our April issue prior to the\n[coronavirus outbreak](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)._\n\n[**Student loan repayments = >**](http://hrexecutive.com/benefits-to-bet-on-\nstudent-loan-repayment/)\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference.

Because you will deliver the\nmessage remotely, you must take extra care to break the news with empathy and\ncompassion. Your aim is to treat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\nOffer a short explanation about the economic conditions that led to the\nlayoff. Stress that the dismissal is not the employee's fault. Rather, it's\nthe result of a global circumstance none of created. Even if you're worried\nthat you, too, might lose your job, don't make the situation about you. Find\nsomeone to vent to--a peer or mentor perhaps, and an outlet for your stress.\nBut don't allow your personal pressures to creep into your interactions with\nyour team. As a manager, you need to be there for your people.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_MaxwellHolyoke-\nHirsch.jpg) Illustration by Maxwell Holyoke-Hirsch\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/how-to-manage-coronavirus-layoffs-with-\ncompassion?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.

Managers are not only dealing with\nthe stress and sadness of having to let go of a large number of their workers,\nmany of them are also feeling underlying anxiety about their own positions.\nEven if laying off employees is the only way to keep the organization running,\nhow do you handle your feelings of guilt and sadness? How should you deliver\nthe news when you can\u2019t meet face-to-face? What should you say to your\nemployees who remain? And what can you do to manage fear about your own\nfuture?\n\n### **What the Experts Say**\n\nLaying off employees is difficult in normal times; but amidst the Covid-19\nglobal health crisis, the task is \u201cemotionally and cognitively overwhelming,\u201d\naccording to Joshua Margolis, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThis\nexperience for most of us is unfathomable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of\nuncertainty and people\u2019s minds are whirring.\u201d As a manager charged with\ndismissing a wide swath of employees, \u201cyou\u2019re pulled in different directions:\nYour heart goes out to people, but you have a responsibility to the\norganization.\u201d That tension is magnified when you\u2019re also worried about your\nown fate, says Kenneth Freeman, Dean Emeritus at Boston University\u2019s Questrom\nSchool of Business. \u201cYou\u2019re human and you\u2019re going to have a lot of those 2 AM\nmoments,\u201d he says. But the key is to try as best you can to separate your\npersonal worries from the task at hand. \u201cIn your role as a manager, you need\nto be there for your people.\u201d Here are some recommendations.\n\n### **Leaders: Reflect on whether layoffs are needed**\n\nIf you\u2019re the one making the decisions about layoffs, Margolis recommends\nasking yourself one question: [is downsizing your workforce truly\nnecessary?](/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-layoffs)\nThe impulse to cut costs is understandable, but \u201cthis is not a periodic\nrecession.\u201d Rather, this pandemic represents \u201can exceptional historic moment\nthat will end up being pivotal for the economy and for people\u2019s communities,\ncareers, and lives,\u201d and it might \u201cwarrant a different response.\u201d As a leader,\nyou need to spark \u201cresourceful, creative thinking about how your organization\ncan save as many jobs as possible.\u201d Freeman suggests gathering your management\nteam and asking, \u201cCan we make sacrifices elsewhere? What are our other options\nto [reduce costs](/2020/03/a-5-day-plan-to-keep-your-company-afloat?ab=hero-\nsubleft-3)?\u201d Your goal is to think broadly about how you distribute the\nwidespread negative consequences of Covid-19. \u201cLaying off people should be the\nlast resort,\u201d he says. And if you must do layoffs, make every effort to \u201cavoid\nmultiple rounds\u201d of cuts.\n\n### **Gather information**\n\nIf you decide layoffs are necessary or others have made that decision for you,\nthen make sure you\u2019re prepared before you reach out to the affected employees.\nFigure out \u201chow and when you will deliver the news to your employees on an\nindividual basis\u201d and what the message will consist of, says Freeman. People\nare likely going to have [a lot of questions about the timing, their benefits,\nand severance](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-\noff). These conversations may need to happen fast, but you\u2019ll have a better\nchance of easing your own and the employee\u2019s anxiety if you can provide them\nwith answers about what happens next. Reach out to HR, your legal department,\nand any other senior leaders who might be able to help you prepare answers to\nquestions such as \u201cWhen will I get my last paycheck?\u201d and \u201cWhat happens to my\n401K?\u201d\n\n### **Understand your limitations**\n\nEven if you\u2019ve presided over layoffs in the past, overseeing them during the\ncoronavirus outbreak will be different for one key reason: they won\u2019t take\nplace in person because of social distancing measures. What\u2019s more, you need\nto have a highly private conversation at a time when privacy is difficult to\nachieve. \u201cWe all have families under foot and lots of things going on,\u201d says\nMargolis. He suggests asking your employee, \u201cIs there a time when I can get 15\nminutes of your full attention?\u201d Be forewarned: you may get pushback. They may\nanticipate what\u2019s coming and \u201csome people aren\u2019t going to have the\npsychological wherewithal to deal with it,\u201d he says. In this case, he\nrecommends saying something like, \u201cCan you let me know when you\u2019re ready to\nhave this conversation so I can tell you the next steps?\u201d\n\n### **Set the right tone**\n\nBecause you will deliver the message remotely, Freeman says that you must\n[take extra care to break the news \u201cwith empathy and\ncompassion](/2016/02/a-guide-to-being-compassionate-during-layoffs).\u201d Your aim\nis to \u201ctreat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\u201d Even though you may\nworry that you, too, might get laid-off, this particular termination is not\nabout you. \u201cThis is not a time for you to take up space,\u201d says Margolis. Don\u2019t\nsuccumb to your insecurities by saying something like, \u201cThis is really hard\nfor me.\u201d At the same time, don\u2019t \u201ctotally detach from your humanity\u201d so that\nyou \u201cbecome a mechanical robot.\u201d Instead, find a way \u201cto engage your emotion\u201d\nand cultivate a \u201ccalm and low-key\u201d manner. Ideally, you will have the\nconversation via video link so that you can \u201cmake eye contact\u201d with the other\nperson. If the conversation takes place on the phone, free yourself of all\ndistractions. \u201cBe fully present and listen.\u201d\n\n### **Be direct and human**\n\nYour message should be \u201cclear, concise, and unequivocal,\u201d says Margolis. For\ninstance, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but at end of next week we are terminating your job.\u201d\nImparting an \u201cexpeditious, direct message can feel cold, but it allows the\nother person to process what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he says. Express gratitude for\ntheir hard work and dedication. Then offer a short and simple explanation\nabout the economic conditions that led to the layoff. \u201cStress that this is not\nabout a specific job performance,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cThis is not the employee\u2019s\nfault. [This is about a global circumstance](/2020/03/understanding-the-\neconomic-shock-of-coronavirus) that none of us created.\u201d Acknowledge, too,\nthat one of the difficult things about being laid off during this crisis is\nthat coworkers won\u2019t get a chance to say goodbye in person. For a lot people,\n\u201ccolleagues are part of their extended family.\u201d Try to convey the message, \u201cWe\nall care about you.\u201d\n\n### **Offer assistance \u2014 but don\u2019t overpromise**\n\nFreeman recommends \u201cbeing readily available\u201d and willing to provide \u201csupport\nand counsel\u201d to your employee even after the initial conversation. Recognize\nthat this person may need time to process the news and [may have\nquestions](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-off) for\nyou later. \u201cThey might come back to reconnect or seek your advice.\u201d Be\nhelpful. Provide information on where your employee should go for government\nbenefits. Offer ideas about job opportunities at other organizations. Offer to\nserve as a reference. But, cautions Margolis, \u201cdon\u2019t overcommit to things you\ncan\u2019t deliver.\u201d For instance, \u201cyou may feel tempted to say, \u2018As things get\nclearer, and the economy improves, you\u2019re on our list to come back,\u2019\u201d he says.\nBut no one has that kind of foresight. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat and don\u2019t give false\nhope.\u201d\n\n### **Be transparent**\n\nIn times like these, your remaining employees will look to you for comfort \u2014\nand an explanation, says Freeman. \u201cThe survivors are going to be worried about\ntheir jobs,\u201d he says. The fact is, \u201cno one knows where this is going to end,\u201d\nso the \u201conus is on you to be as transparent as possible.\u201d He recommends you\nhold an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session \u2014 an open forum of sorts \u2014 so that \u201crumors\ndon\u2019t take over.\u201d You will need \u201ca succinct explanation for why the layoffs\nwere necessary,\u201d says Margolis. He recommends something like, \u201cThe\norganization is facing a challenge unlike anything it has ever faced. Let me\ntell you what we did, why we did it, and how we can move on.\u201d Then it\u2019s up to\nyou to \u201cabsorb their tension and agitation\u201d and listen to their concerns. You\nneed to \u201cexude a commitment to continue to move forward,\u201d he says.\n\n### **Vent (selectively)**\n\nThis is an [excruciatingly stressful time for everyone](/2020/03/coping-with-\nfatigue-fear-and-panic-during-a-crisis), and managers often bear an extra\nburden, says Freeman. \u201cYou feel responsible for the livelihoods of your team\nand for the health and wellbeing of their families,\u201d says Freeman. One of the\nmany ways that people \u201ccope with turbulence\u201d is by going to [routines and\nrituals](/2020/04/the-restorative-power-of-ritual), says Margolis. But because\nof widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders, our routines \u201chave been\ndisrupted.\u201d It\u2019s critical, therefore, that you have \u201ca place where you can\nvent, release tension, and where you deal with your worries.\u201d Find someone\nelse you can talk to \u2014 a peer perhaps, a mentor, or a colleague at a different\norganization. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to articulate in certain circles that you don\u2019t know\nabout your own future and that unleashes worry.\u201d But be selective and cautious\nabout how much stress and emotion you show to your team. \u201cAll eyes are on you\u201d\nto provide a path forward.\n\n### **Focus on your wellbeing**\n\nFinally, take care of yourself, says Margolis. \u201cHopefully, this is the only\ntime you face something of this magnitude. But it\u2019s unlikely to be the only\ntime you face a challenge during a period of great uncertainty.\u201d The best\ncoping mechanism for when you can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s in store for you is\n[self-care](/2017/06/6-ways-to-weave-self-care-into-your-workday).\u201d Eat\nhealthy, wholesome food; get regular exercise; [try meditating](/2020/03/why-\nleaders-need-meditation-now-more-than-ever); get plenty of sleep at night;\nread a good book. [A little perspective helps too](/2020/03/youre-not-\npowerless-in-the-face-of-uncertainty). After all, \u201cyou are not alone,\u201d says\nFreeman. Unfortunately, \u201cthere are a lot of supervisors going through this.\u201d\n** **\n\n### **Principles to Remember**\n\n**Do:  **\n\n  * Think carefully about whether layoffs are necessary and reflect on ways your organization can save as many jobs as possible.\n  * Show compassion for your employee and stress that the layoff is not their fault.\n  * Seek out a peer or a colleague outside your organization to whom you can vent and ask for help in coping with your own uncertainty.\n\n**Don\u2019t:  **\n\n  * Overcommit. Provide support and counsel to the people you\u2019ve laid off, but don\u2019t promise things you can\u2019t deliver.\n  * Make this about you. Avoid saying things like, \u201cThis is really hard for me.\u201d\n  * Neglect your wellbeing. Make a concerted effort to eat well and get enough sleep, and take time for self-care, including exercise and meditation.\n\n_The cases below are from people who have presided over layoffs in the past.\nWhile the circumstances today are unique, hopefully the previous experience of\nleaders provides some helpful lessons._\n\n### **Case Study #1: Part of your job is to absorb the emotion**\n\nLeah Solivan, the founder and former CEO of TaskRabbit, the online marketplace\nthat lets people hire freelancers for odd jobs, says the recent rash of\nlayoffs due to the coronavirus crisis is giving her ugly flashbacks. \u201cI feel\nlike I have PTSD,\u201d she says. \u201cI know exactly how these founders and managers\nfeel.\u201d\n\nLeah founded TaskRabbit just a few months before the global financial crisis\nthat began in 2008; and she oversaw several rounds of layoffs before her\ncompany was acquired by IKEA.\n\nThe year 2014 sticks with her. The economy was improving, but TaskRabbit faced\nan uncertain future. Customers were shifting toward mobile technology and\ncompetition for the platform was intensifying.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/coronavirus_cover.png)\n\n###### [Coronavirus + Business: The Insights You Need from\nHBR](https://store.hbr.org/product/coronavirus-and-business-the-insights-you-\nneed-from-harvard-business-review/10440?sku=10440E-KND-ENG?referral=02560)\n\nLeadership & Managing People FREE EBOOK\n\nAdd to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nLeah realized she couldn\u2019t hold on to the company that she had worked so hard\nto build unless she made big changes. After many agonizing conversations with\nthe company\u2019s five-member executive team, Leah came to the conclusion that she\nneeded to eliminate 20 employees, about 25% of the workforce.\n\n\u201cI knew it was best for the company in the long run, but at the time I was\nliving my worst nightmare,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was letting people down.\u201d\n\nBut Leah understood that these layoffs were not about her. \u201cHowever difficult\nit was for the team and I to make the decision, I knew it was going to be more\ndifficult for the people I had to let go.\u201d\n\nHer first order of business was to craft a message to the affected employees\nthat was short and succinct. She said something like, \u201cWe are not on a\nsustainable path. In order for the company to be healthy and move forward, we\nneed to reorganize the team and unfortunately not everyone can stay.\u201d\n\nLeah met with each employee individually and offered compassionate support,\nincluding a generous severance package. She also worked her network to help\ndeparting employees find new job opportunities. \u201cI wanted to take care of\nthese people so they could make a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nAfter, she talked with her remaining team members and offered to answer any\nquestions. \u201cAt the end of that day, we had a companywide meeting where people\ngot up and said what was on their minds. Some said, \u2018I feel sad,\u2019 or \u2018I feel\nangry,\u2019 or \u2018I feel disappointed.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to hear those things, Leah admits. \u201cMy job was to absorb it,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cAnd I felt like a failure.\u201d\n\nPreserving her own mental health and resilience was a challenge. She recalls\nventing to her executive team. The camaraderie helped. \u201cWe were all in the\ntrenches together.\u201d\n\nToday Leah invests in startups as a VC at Fuel Capital. Lately, she has been\noffering guidance to companies as they face similar challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s no\nway around it: layoffs are hard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the most difficult thing I\nhad to do.\u201d ** **\n\n### **Case Study #2: Offer compassionate support and express gratitude**\n\nAs a longtime veteran of the HR industry, Carla Yudhishthu has overseen\nseveral corporate downsizings over the course of her career. It never gets\neasier. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to be as honest as you can and treat people with\ndignity, but you have to manage your own emotions and your own fears, too,\u201d\nsays Carla.\n\nShe remembers a round of layoffs early in her career that was particularly\ndifficult. The year was 2003. She was working for a publicly held medical\ndevice business in the Bay Area that had already underwent a round of layoffs\nin 2001.\n\n\u201cWe hoped we would only have to do it once, but the company was facing a lot\nof problems and we needed to have multiple iterations,\u201d she says.\n\nAs an HR manager, Carla was tasked with laying off dozens of employees \u2014\nincluding several people on her team. \u201cI had to tell my colleague who was 20\nyears older than me and had a family that he no longer had a job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Who am I do to this? Will I be ok?\u2019\u201d\n\nCarla remembers [practicing what she would say](/2015/06/how-to-tell-someone-\ntheyre-being-laid-off). \u201cYou need to get through the pragmatic details,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cBut it\u2019s emotional and when someone reacts emotionally you can lose\ntrack of what you have to say.\u201d\n\nCarla says she approached the layoffs with humility and honesty. She also\nwanted to offer as much help and support as she could. Before breaking the\nnews, she and her colleagues gathered information on to how to access\nunemployment and the limitations on COBRA benefits. \u201cWe put a lot of thought\ninto what the message should be,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we tried to anticipate any\nquestions that people might have.\u201d\n\nShe received reassurance from her unit\u2019s leadership that her job was safe. But\nher cortisol levels remained high. To cope, she compartmentalized the task at\nhand. \u201cFrom 7:30AM to 5:30PM, I needed to think about the organization; I\ncould worry about myself after that,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI remember doing lots of deep breathing, and lots of running and yoga.\u201d\n\nCommunicating the news to the remaining employees was another challenge. She\nand her colleagues in HR were transparent. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make promises because\nwe knew our company needed get out of the woods,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted to give\neveryone confidence that everything was going to be ok. But we couldn\u2019t. No\none was secure.\u201d\n\nThat company eventually closed and today Carla is the VP of People Operations\nat Mammoth HR and ThinkHR. Her advice for managers overseeing layoffs today:\n\u201cTry to create a personal connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite your employees a thank you note to express your gratitude and\nappreciation and say goodbye,\u201d she says. \u201cAt a time [like this], it\u2019s a\ngesture that will be remembered.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[Rebecca Knight](/search?term=rebecca%20knight&search_type=search-all) is a\nfreelance journalist in Boston and a lecturer at Wesleyan University.

Under this additional initiative,\nall companies with local employees earning a monthly salary each of RM4,000\nand below will receive wage subsidies according to the size of their\nworkforce.\n\n  * Companies with a workforce of more than 200 people will receive a wage subsidy of RM600 per month for every retained worker; the maximum number of workers that a company is eligible to claim for will also be increased from 100 to 200.\n  * Companies with between 75 to 200 employees will receive a wage subsidy of RM800 per month for every employee.\n  * Finally, companies with less than 75 employees will receive a wage subsidy of RM1,200 per month per employee. Through this enhancement, companies will receive more benefits and assistance.\n\nThis assistance will be for three months, and is specifically for employers\nregistered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) or local\nauthorities before 1 January 2020, and are registered with the Social Security\nOrganisation. It is estimated that 4.8mn employees will benefit from this\ninitiative.\n\nEmployers opting to accept this assistance are required to retain their\nemployees a minimum period of six months, i.e. three months during the period\nof assistance and three months thereafter.\n\nSecond, a Special Prihatin Grant amounting to RM2.1bn will be established for\neligible micro-enterprises, with RM3,000 allocated to each company. This will\nbenefit almost 700,000 micro-enterprises, and these firms will have to\nregister with LHDN to receive this assistance.\n\nThird, PM Muhyiddin urged registered money lenders who offer credit facilities\nunder the Money Lenders Act 1951, to provide moratoriums to SMEs on loan\nrepayments for six months starting April 2020, similar to what banks are\nproviding. He added: \"hope that these money lending organisations are equally\nsympathetic to the hardship faced by their clients and together helping to\nease their financial burden.\"\n\n**The government has also undertaken a series of initiatives for SMES to fully\nbenefit from the assistance measures announced. These include:**\n\n  * First, the abolishment of the 2% interest rate under the Micro Credit Scheme amounting to RM500mn under Bank Simpanan Nasional. The soft loan scheme for micro-enterprises is also extended to TEKUN Nasional with a maximum loan limit of RM10,000 at 0% for each enterprise. A total of RM200mn will be allocated in funds for this purpose. Applicants are given an option to choose either scheme to ensure more beneficiaries of this facility.\n  * Second, waiving or providing discounts for rentals to SMEs in the retail sector, which are operating on premises owned by Government-Linked Companies (GLCs). \"I would like to thank GLCs such as MARA, PETRONAS, PNB, PLUS and UDA as well as several State Governments who have agreed to give either discounts or rental waivers on their premises to SME tenants,\" PM Muhyiddin shared. He also urged owners of private premises to provide similar assistance to their tenants, in reducing their rental rates.\n  * Third, reducing foreign worker levies by 25%, to all companies with work permits expiring between 1 April to 31 December 2020. This reduction will not apply to the domestic help sector.\n\nMoving on, PM Muhyiddin noted that employers would currently be facing\ndifficulties retaining employees. \"In this regard, the Government encourages\nemployers to actively engage with their employees on employment terms\nincluding the options of pay cuts and unpaid leave during the MCO period.\n\n\"Employers and employees may refer to the Department of Labour to seek advice\non solutions for issues raised. Any negotiations should be subjected to\nemployment laws currently being enforced. What is important is that the rights\nand welfare of both sides are taken care of.\"\n\nApart from the above, companies will be given a three-month extension for the\nlodgement of financial statements, for firms whose financial year ended\nbetween 30 September to 31 December 2019. These companies are required to\napply for the extension with SSM, with no fees imposed.\n\nLastly, to ensure all Prihatin and Prihatin Plus initiatives are implemented\npromptly and smoothly, a unit, LAKSANA, has been established under the\nMinistry of Finance to monitor and report the progress of implementation of\nall initiatives to both the Finance Minister and the PM.\n\nPM Muhyiddin also added that a [portal](http://IMSME.COM.MY) managed by Credit\nGuarantee Corporation in collaboration with BNM, has been established to\nsupport the execution of the Prihatin initiatives, and is ready to accept\napplications from SMEs on all the initiatives announced.\n\n\"So, other than applying for loans directly from the banking institution, all\nSMEs have an option to apply for loans through the [IMSME\nportal](http://IMSME.COM.MY). This portal provides myKNP services, that is\nfinancing advisory services for SMEs.\"\n\n* * *\n\n### Human Resources Online is on Telegram!

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nAs the focus of the modern world pushes for higher productivity, there is an\nunsettling trend for businesses to force employees to work past the end of the\nworkday. Some even offer higher payment or days off as incentives to keep\ntheir employees productive after the company has closed its day's operations.\nWork-life balance suffers when this happens, and it's not uncommon to see\nemployees experiencing burnout as a result.\n\nKnowing when to pack it in for the day is as important as knowing when to\nstart working. Below, eight associates of[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) examine the benefits that come with\nencouraging employees to disconnect after a long day's work, and how this\ncould help both the business and the employee in the long run.\n\nMembers share the best ways to encourage employees to disconnect from work at\nthe end of the day.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Avoiding Employee Burnout**\n\nIt is too easy for employees to feel the need to answer every email. One\npractice is to ensure managers are not contacting employees after hours. An\neasy fix is for managers to schedule emails to be delivered during work hours.\nEncourage employees to take vacation time -- you can deactivate their service\nduring their vacation and reactivate when they return. - [Patricia\nSharkey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciasharkey),[ IMI\nPeople](http://www.imipeople.com/)\n\n**2\\. Promoting Work-Life Balance**\n\nEncouraging employees to disconnect after work promotes work-life balance.\nWork-life balance enables employees to rest, perform their hobbies and spend\nquality time with their friends and family members. Promoting a culture of\nwork-life balance will lead to increased employee engagement, enhanced\nemployee productivity, reduced attrition and improved company brand\nperception. - [Ochuko Dasimaka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ochukodasimaka),[\nCareer Heights Consulting, Inc.](http://www.careerheights.org/)\n\n**3\\. Improving Efficiency**\n\nResearch shows that humans need downtime and brain breaks for maximum\nefficiency. We've found that our staff is more productive and eager to work\nwhen they're well-rested, healthy and have taken some time for themselves.\nThat's why at our weekly all-hands we do a green/yellow/red check-in to be\nsure we're all in a good headspace to start the week. -[ Yolanda\nLau](https://twitter.com/yolandafan),[ FlexTeam](https://www.flexteam.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Higher Productivity Levels**\n\nShort answer: your workforce will be more productive. While leaders should\nencourage work-life fluidity, an important aspect of that is taking the\nappropriate amount of time to truly be \"offline.\" When people are happy in\ntheir personal lives, they'll be motivated to succeed at work. And, when\npeople have time to disconnect, they are given more mental capacity to bring\ncreativity into their work. -[ Lisa\nSterling](https://twitter.com/lisamsterling),[\nCeridian](http://www.ceridian.com/)\n\n**5\\. Increased Creativity And Engagement**\n\nThe workplace has changed dramatically! Employees demand better balance than\nprior generations experienced at work. We find that when employees are given\nthe opportunity to unplug at night and on weekends, they are recharged and\nrefreshed and come back to work with higher levels of creativity and\nengagement. When employees are more engaged they are more innovative and\nproductive! - [Diane Strohfus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianestrohfus),[\nBetterworks.com](http://www.betterworks.com/)\n\n**6\\. Higher Retention Rates**\n\nWhen employees are encouraged to disconnect at the end of the workday and on\nweekends, they come back to work with increased creativity, higher job\nsatisfaction, and increased retention rates because they aren't burned out.\nEmployees who can take time off to unwind also tend to feel more valued by the\ncompany as an individual, rather than feeling like a replaceable piece of the\nbusiness. - [Laura Spawn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraspawn),[ Virtual\nVocations, Inc.](https://www.virtualvocations.com/)\n\n**7\\. Building Respect And Loyalty**\n\nRespecting boundaries like weeknights and weekends builds employee loyalty. If\nworkers know that they are treated as whole humans, then they will return the\nfavor by committing to their employer. Retention of refreshed, productive and\nenergized employees will result in successful execution of goals and will\ncreate impactful careers. Both employees and companies benefit from protected\ndowntime. - [Jessica\nDelorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicadelorenzo),[ Kimball Electronics\nInc](http://www.kimballelectronics.com/)\n\n**8\\. Honoring Employees As People**\n\nEmployees need a chance to recharge. Using evenings and weekends as personal\ntime empowers employees to pursue personal interests, spend time with their\nfamilies and rest. During work hours, they can be fully engaged in their work,\nand perhaps even more creative because their brains and bodies are refreshed.\nIt's also a way of honoring employees as full people rather than as cogs in a\nmachine. -[ Courtney Pace, Ph.D.](https://twitter.com/RevDrMom_Pace),[ FedEx\nEmployees Credit Assoc.](http://www.fecca.com/)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

Remote work encourages greater self-empowerment. There\u2019s no manager\nbreathing down employees\u2019 necks. It\u2019s really up to the individual to get the\njob done, which breeds a sense of accomplishment and pride. The more a person\nfeels like they\u2019re achieving something worthwhile, the more connected they\nfeel to a business,\" said Katy Stevens, vice president at Culture Amp APAC.\n\nAmid COVID-19, apart from leaning into apps and drop-in sessions, the employee\nsurvey startup's CEO and co-founder Didier Elzinga also produces a short daily\nvideo to update everyone on the situation and market trends.\n\nIn the survey, the only area where remote workers fall slightly below their\nnon-remote counterparts in Hong Kong is respect (-3). Stevens said the lack of\n\u201cface-to-face\u201d time or lack of insight into the habits/productivity of remote\nworkers could be the potential reason why employees might feel less respect\nfrom their managers while working from home.\n\nEmployees may sense their managers perceiving them as \u201cslacking off\u201d, which\ntranslates to slightly less respect \u2013 especially in a place like Hong Kong\nwhere burning the midnight oil remains an ingrained cultural measure of an\nemployee\u2019s commitment to their job.\n\n\"It\u2019s really important for employers to make a mindset shift. Presenteeism is\nnot an accurate measure of a person\u2019s performance. Instead, consider an\napproach that includes employee feedback, goal attainment and skill growth as\nmeasures of an individual\u2019s contribution and overall performance,\" Stevens\nsaid.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Integrated Benefits Institute finds the staggering cost of\nsick leave and short-term disability as a result of the pandemic.\n\nBy: [Kathryn Mayer](https://hrexecutive.com/author/kathryn-mayer/

from work due to COVID-19 could cost employers more than $23 billion\nin benefits for absent workers, impacting up to 5.6 million employees, new\nresearch finds.\n\nThe staggering figure comes from the Integrated Benefits Institute, which\nassessed potential sick leave wages, short-term disability payments and\nspending on employee benefits for absent workers. IBI used employment, wage\nand leave benefit data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and lost workday\nexperiences contained in IBI\u2019s dataset of employer-sponsored STD claims to\nmodel lost work time impacts for low-, mid- and high-range scenarios depending\non the total COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\nIn terms of the costs of COVID-19 absences, \u201cwhat we might see play out are\nthe implications of employers\u2019 decisions about emphasizing care management and\nsupport for healthy lifestyles as part of their overall benefits strategies,\u201d\nsays Brian Gifford, research and analytics director for IBI. \u201cThat could turn\nout to be important not only for leave payments, but for some people the\ndifference between whether or not they needed scarce resources such as\nventilators in order to pull through. We may not know the answer to that until\nwe are able to get a look at employees from different companies with different\nbenefits policies and see how they fared during and after the pandemic.\u201d\n\n[**Read all of _HRE_ \u2019s coronavirus coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)\n\nUp to 5.6 million employees could be impacted by coronavirus-related leave,\nIBI notes, with nearly 3 million workers at firms with fewer than 500\nemployees entitled to paid leave per the Families First Coronavirus Response\nAct that went into effect April 1.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things to keep in mind is that this analysis\nassumes a pretty low rate of very serious, ICU cases\u2014about 8% of the total.\nThat keeps absence durations relatively short,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cBut at least\nfor younger workers, those serious cases are driven by complications such as\ncardiovascular conditions and diabetes\u2014things that unfortunately are not\nuncommon in the workforce, and which impose productivity burdens under the\nbest of circumstances.\u201d\n\nIBI\u2019s analysis follows other research that indicates the significant cost\nCOVID-19 is having on benefits. [Willis Towers\nWatson](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/), for instance, recently found that\nemployer healthcare costs could increase up to 7% this year due to coronavirus\ntreatment and testing costs\u2014on top of the 5% increase companies had already\nprojected before the pandemic. That analysis finds that a 30% infection rate\ncould increase medical and prescription drug costs between 4% and 7%,\ndepending on how sick COVID-19 patients become.\n\n**Related:** [Here\u2019s how much employer healthcare costs could increase due to\ncoronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/)\n\n\u201cDespite employers and employees taking the right precautions at this perilous\ntime, the coronavirus continues to spread and place enormous pressure on our\nnation\u2019s healthcare system,\u201d says Trevis Parson, chief actuary at Willis\nTowers Watson. \u201cThis spike in the demand for care is likely to lead to a\nsignificant jump in employer healthcare costs beyond previous expectations.\u201d\n\nGifford adds that the best benefits cost control strategy for employers is\n\u201cminimizing exposure to infections by enforcing social distance policies where\npossible and operating safely when the work has to continue for essential\nservices.\u201d\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference. She has covered benefits for the better part of a\ndecade, and her stories have won multiple awards, including a Jesse H. Neal\nAward and honors from the American Society of Business Publication Editors and\nthe National Federation of Press Women.

Well-\nconstructed solutions including free benefit administration, plus proven\nintegrations for services and benefits, result in excellent outcomes with more\nflexibility and lower cost. These solutions continually improve, increasing\ntheir value.\n\nWith a free benefits administration solution, each party profits from\ncollaboration. Brokers and their clients can save a lot of money and enjoy\nhigh-quality benefit administration, or obtain benefit administration for a\nwide range of situations. Comparisons from independent sources such as\nCapterra bear this out.\n\nLet\u2019s challenge additional misconceptions stated in Burkett\u2019s article:\n\n1\\. \u201cFree benefits administration solutions are often difficult to integrate\ninto existing HR systems and, as a result, may do little to improve\nprocesses,\u201d she writes.\n\nFree solutions have been available for more than 20 years. The software can\ncoordinate with dozens of HRIS platforms. However, eliminating the benefit\nadministration module typically saves $5 to $7 per employee per month. Clients\nreceive a payroll file (often automated) instead _._\n\n2\\. \u201cAn employer may give up a significant amount of control over employee\ndata and strategic management of benefit plans,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nFree solutions can provide HR total control of all plan design and access.\nClients can schedule automated payroll file transfer to both HR and broker,\nwith confirmations for both sent and failed transfers.\n\n3\\. \u201cAn employer that relies on a free benefits administration solution also\nmay struggle to sever ties with the owner of the technology if a decision is\nmade to partner with other carriers or even change consultants in the future.\nSince a consultant or carrier in such an arrangement owns the technology, the\ncompany can lose electronic access to their benefits administration solution\nand all the current and historical data, requiring an employer to collect all\nnew data from employees,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nContractual solutions exist, eliminating this concern. These contracts include\n\u201cflexible but standard\u201d free data transfer on termination. If a client wants a\ncustom export, there is a reasonable fee, typically not more than $600.\n\n4\\. \u201cAutomated data file feeds between payroll/HR systems and the free\nbenefits administration solution are not widely available or often limited,\nwhich can impact data integrity,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nSolutions provide robust export tools. When asked to compare the renewal\nprocess from a well-known competitor, the free system did in one minute what\nthe other program required a full hour of tedious data reentry to accomplish.\n\n5\\. \u201cWhile the data can be shared between systems with manual bulk imports and\nexports, these processes are challenging to adopt, and many HR teams end up\nentering the data by hand,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nA free solution has sophisticated tools, including the ability to build and\nmaintain 834 EDI files. The solution is hosted in the cloud (Azure), a HITRUST\nenvironment, and the vendor has its own SOC1SAE18 Type II certification.\n\n6\\. \u201cAn organization that receives benefits administration at gratis from\nanother party has no ownership control over the employee data and is at a\nmajor disadvantage if it decides to terminate the relationship,\u201d Burkett\nwrites.\n\nThe contract is with the employer.\n\nThe free solutions offer collaborations including:  \n\n  * Integration with any payroll system (including automated data feeds).\n  * Collaborations with any medical carrier.\n  * Selection from more than 100 voluntary benefits.\n  * Administrative services (FSA, HSA, COBRA).\n  * Wellness strategies (both physical and financial).\n  * Single, side login with health assessment.\n  * Dependent and claim auditing.\n\nIn addition to the huge portfolio of discounted collaborating services\navailable, some free solutions can integrate with any system (insurance\ncarrier, payroll, third-party administrator, etc.).\n\nHR enjoys more options with each vendor (ACA, FSA, voluntary benefits) rther\nthan packages with expensive alternatives. That is because the core of the\nsystem, benefit administration, is free. In my view, the savings an employer\ncan realize using free benefit administration is significant. There is no\nsacrifice of control or capability, and the free system, with a bilingual\nself-service platform, improves engagement, an essential but often overlooked\ncomponent.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba08200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/91x91+0+15/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fb9%2F14%2F5047ec634484927223f99cffb23b%2Fdfreund.jpg)\n](https://www.employeebenefitadviser.com/author/daniel-freund)\n\n[Daniel

is an inevitable result of the digital era. When you can track anything\nand everything, there\u2019s an inherent opportunity within the resulting\ninformation. It\u2019s an area which companies are investigating and actioning;\nalongside anecdotal evidence from our own clients\u2019 feedback, one of the key\ntrends uncovered in Aon\u2019s [latest UK Benefits and Trends\nsurvey](https://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/employee-\nbenefits/resources/benefits-and-\ntrends/default.jsp?utm_source=Personnel+Today&utm_medium=Content&utm_campaign=EB-Q1-BensTrends-20&utm_content=PT-\nArticle) is an increased interest in collating and using this data across\nmultiple areas.\n\n**The steady rise of online benefits**\n\n## Aon's UK Benefits and Trends survey looks at the key benefits trends for\n2020\n\n**[Download now](https://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/employee-\nbenefits/resources/benefits-and-\ntrends/default.jsp?utm_source=Personnel+Today&utm_medium=Content&utm_campaign=EB-Q1-BensTrends-20&utm_content=PT-\nArticle)**\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, online benefits have continued their upward trend; 50%\nof companies now offer them to their employees (up from 45% last year).\nUtilising an online benefits platform has numerous advantages when it comes to\nmeasuring employee engagement \u2013 the 2020 Benefits and Trends survey showed\nthat most companies measure benefit take-up rates and portal clicks. This data\ncan then be used to assess the popularity of certain benefits \u2013 and help build\na wider picture of user behaviour and interests. It can also help you identify\npotential discrepancies between interest and actions \u2013 ones which would have\notherwise remained hidden from view. Perhaps there\u2019s a high level of click-\nthroughs for a particular benefit, but low real-world uptake \u2013 indicating that\nthere is an interest, but the solution isn\u2019t quite the right fit or there\u2019s a\nlack of understanding. Digital data can shine a light on areas which would\notherwise remain in the dark.\n\n**The emergence of apps**\n\nCompanies are also turning to apps to deliver a streamlined experience when it\ncomes to offering and communicating benefits. The survey showed that 14% of\nbusinesses currently have an app in place, with 32% planning to introduce them\nto their workforce. As with online platforms, the opportunity for data is\nendless. Employee wellbeing apps \u2013 such as Well One, or Well One Money \u2013\nprovide further opportunity to gain actionable insights on your workforce.\nAnonymised and aggregated data from these types of platforms can be used to\npinpoint problem areas, develop a tailored benefits strategy, and measure the\nimpact in real-time.\n\n**Metrics and measuring**\n\nThe Benefits and Trends report also showed that there\u2019s been a noticeable\nincrease in companies measuring against their objectives \u2013 91% of companies\nare now measuring their performance \u2013 in comparison to 86% in 2019 \u2013 with over\nhalf rating themselves as \u2018somewhat successful\u2019 at achieving their goals. This\nactivity is underpinned by the need for data; without baselines, KPIs, goals\nand metrics, nothing can be tracked effectively. Technology is a core enabler\nof data generation; the automated collecting and processing of data delivers\ninsights which would be otherwise time-consuming to collate. With the vast\nmajority of companies assessing performance (and presumably return-on-\ninvestment) the need for accurate, reliable data is key. The right insights at\nthe right time will inevitably help businesses reach their goals \u2013 or\nhighlight areas where goals might need adjustment.\n\n**Smarter, targeted strategies**\n\nData can inform and drive your benefits strategy and beyond. It can help you\ncreate a full picture \u2013 from information about your employees\u2019 demographics\nand their life events, to benefits they\u2019re interested in or even how they\u2019d\nprefer to be contacted about the schemes your company run. Surveys, focus\ngroups and opt-in preferences can all create a well-informed data picture.\nThis information can help companies offer more relevant benefits (ones\nemployees value and appreciate), and run targeted communications (ones\nemployees may actually pay attention to). Better communications can lead to\nbetter engagement \u2013 and potentially happier, healthier employees too. It\u2019s a\nwin-win.\n\n**The VIP EVP**\n\nData doesn\u2019t just drive value for employers \u2013 it should also reinforce value\nfor employees. The 2020 Benefits and Trends survey showed an increase in\ncompanies communicating their Employee Value Proposition (EVP). Of course, an\nEmployee Value Proposition is far more than just employee benefits \u2013 it forms\nthe wider employee experience \u2013 but they can play an integral role. Total\nReward Statements can be an impactful way of communicating the full value of\nan employees\u2019 package. Informed by an individual\u2019s benefits choices, they\nprovide a data-led overview personalised to each employee. Sharing this\ninformation in one place can drive further engagement and help boost retention\ntoo.\n\nWhatever your benefits strategy or goals, data is likely an omnipresent factor\nin achieving success. Relevant and actionable data has the potential to\ntransform your benefits programme, your business performance, and \u2013 most\nimportantly \u2013 the lives of your employees. Good, actionable data can do more\nthan simply evaluate effectiveness. It can \u2013 and should \u2013 lead the way.  \n\n| [Download now

Olson/Getty Images)\n\nTarget is changing up its employee benefits as the coronavirus pandemic\npresses on.\n\nThe retailer said this week it will give all its employees access to a backup\nfamily care benefit\u2014a plan that was previously offered to some Target\nworkers\u2014to help employees through the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn the face of school and other care-facility closures, backup care will be\navailable to all, including frontline team members who are doing so much right\nnow,\u201d Target CEO and Chairman Brian Cornell said in a statement.\n\nTarget rolled out a backup daycare benefit last fall, providing workers with\n20 days of \u201cin-center childcare or in-home child- and eldercare\u201d through a\npartner network. In light of [coronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/a-daily-\nshot-your-covid-19-update/), the retailer is waiving eligibility requirements,\ncopays and other program details.\n\nChildcare benefits are getting more attention in recent days, as schools\nthroughout the country have closed, leaving employees who must go to work\nstruggling to find care for their children.\n\nCornell also said this week that the company is encouraging all employees who\nare able to work remotely to do so.\n\nThe updated family care benefits join other changes Target made late last\nweek. Those include temporarily waiving the absenteeism policy for employees\nwho experience flu-like symptoms or who are affected by school or daycare\nclosures; and implementing quarantine pay and confirmed illness pay, both\nlasting 14 days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also continue to offer benefits like paid family leave and free\ncounseling services for the range of challenges our team might be facing,\u201d\nCornell said.\n\nTarget is one of several companies making changes to their employee benefits\npackages as coronavirus changes workplace dynamics. Darden Restaurants, which\nowns popular eateries like Olive Garden and Yard House, expanded its paid sick\nleave policy to include hourly workers across its different restaurant brands.\n\n**Related** : [Paid leave at the center of the coronavirus\nconversation](https://hrexecutive.com/paid-leave-at-the-center-of-the-\ncoronavirus-conversation/)\n\nAmazon, DoorDash, Instacart and Lowe\u2019s said they would provide up to 14 paid\ndays off to any employee quarantined or diagnosed with the coronavirus.\nMeanwhile, several employers are implementing and encouraging remote work\nbenefits.\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference.

Many require an\nindividual to be in status or authorized to work in order to collect benefits.\nHowever, most nonimmigrant visas only allow a foreign national to work for the\npetitioning employer. Therefore, when the employment relationship is\nterminated, the foreign national usually falls out of status. Some foreign\nnationals (H-1B, E-2, L-1, and some others) are allowed a 60 day grace period\nto find new employment. Arguably, those individuals are in status and may be\nsubsequently authorized to work.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Health)\n\nCVS Health is expanding and adding benefits for its employees as a result of\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJoining other retailers that remain open during the coronavirus pandemic and\nare eager to keep workers, the company says it\u2019s expanding sick leave for\npart-time employees, handing out bonuses and adding a daycare benefit for all\nemployees.\n\n**Related:**[8 benefits employers should zero in on during the COVID-19\npandemic](https://hrexecutive.com/8-benefits-employers-should-zero-in-on-\nduring-the-coronavirus-pandemic/)\n\nThe company now offers 24 hours of paid sick leave to part-time employees for\nthe duration of the coronavirus pandemic. That\u2019s in addition to the 14-day\npaid leave the company will provide to any employee who tests positive for\nCOVID-19 or needs to be quarantined as a result of potential exposure. CVS\nHealth already offers full-time employees [paid sick\nleave](https://hrexecutive.com/paid-leave-at-the-center-of-the-coronavirus-\nconversation/), the company notes.\n\nEmployees at CVS locations across the country will receive bonuses between\n$150 and $500. The bonuses have been earmarked for pharmacists and healthcare\nprofessionals on the frontlines, store associates and managers, and other\nsite-based hourly employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the company is rolling out a childcare and eldercare benefit\nthat will give employees up to 25 fully covered days of backup care. The\nbenefit\u2014offered through provider Bright Horizons\u2014kicks in in early April for\nfull- and part-time employees.\n\n[**Read all of _HRE_ \u2019s coronavirus coverage\nhere**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/) **.**\n\nChildcare and caregiving benefits are getting more attention in recent days,\nas schools throughout the country have closed, leaving employees who must go\nto work struggling to find care for their children.\n[Target](https://hrexecutive.com/target-updates-benefits-in-wake-of-\ncoronavirus/) also recently said it will give all its employees access to a\nbackup family care benefit\u2014a plan that was previously offered to some of its\nworkers\u2014to help employees through the pandemic.\n\n**Related:** [The new reality of remote work and\ncaregiving](https://hrexecutive.com/the-new-reality-of-remote-work-and-\ncaregiving/)\n\nEmergency COVID-19 sick leave and employee bonuses have also been embraced by\nother employers as a response to the pandemic.\n[Kroger](https://hrexecutive.com/kroger-handing-out-bonuses-adding-\ncovid-19-leave/), for instance, is providing a one-time bonus to every hourly\nfrontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing and customer service associate,\namounting to $300 for full-time associates and $150 for part-time associates.\nKroger also will give employees up to 14 paid sick days if they are either\ndiagnosed with or placed under quarantine due to COVID-19, or for symptoms as\nverified by an accredited healthcare professional.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is handing out bonuses of $300 to full-time employees and\n$150 to part-time employees for a total payout of more than $365 million.\n\nHR organization WorldatWork said last week that about a quarter of the 267\nemployers it surveyed planned to provide hazard pay for employees who are\nrequired to work on-site during the pandemic. Of those, 9% said they will\noffer a cash incentive that is a flat dollar amount, 8% will give cash\nincentives tied to hours and shifts worked, and 9% will give cash incentives\nthat are based on a different formula, such as a percentage of salary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployers turning to bonuses and other benefits say they are a way to help\nemployees through unprecedented times, as well as show appreciation for their\nwork.\n\n\u201cOur colleagues have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to providing\nessential goods and services at a time when they\u2019re needed most,\u201d CVS Health\nPresident and CEO Larry Merlo said in a statement. \u201cAs they continue to be\nthere for the individuals and families we serve, we're taking extra steps to\nprovide some peace of mind and help them navigate these uncertain times.\u201d\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference.

The reality is that almost everyone is struggling to get\nthrough this unanticipated and unprecedented situation. Many businesses are\nfaced with a situation where they cannot afford to pay their staff but they\nmay not have the right to lay them off temporarily; they are stuck between the\nproverbial rock and hard place, and something has got to give.\n\nAll levels of government have announced various measures in order to assist\nbusinesses, individuals, and families during the pandemic. Recently, there\nhave been some significant developments, including the Canada Emergency Wage\nSubsidy and the Work-Sharing Program. The Wage Subsidy is a federal program\noffering a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of wages and may prevent or end a\nsignificant number of layoffs if it can be implemented quickly. We know that\nmany of our clients believe that it will change their situation significantly.\n\nThe purpose of this blog post is to provide an overview of some of the key\nsupports that are currently available in order to help employers avoid layoffs\nand help employees keep their jobs. Given that the information is constantly\nbeing updated, it can be difficult to keep up with the changes, and we\nencourage readers to access our firm's running blog on COVID-19 workplace\nissues on a regular basis to get the latest information.\n\n**Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy**\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced that qualifying businesses\ncould receive a wage subsidy of up to 75 per cent in order to help them to\nkeep and return workers to the payroll. The key details are outlined below,\nalthough there will be further updates in the coming days.\n\n**Who?** The temporary wage subsidy is available to employers of all sizes and\nacross all sectors of the economy, including non-profit organizations and\nregistered charities. However, public sector entities are excluded.\n\nIn order to be eligible, the employer has to show that the company's sales\nhave decreased by at least 30 per cent on a monthly basis when compared with\nthe same month in the prior year (for example, if the wage subsidy is for\nApril 2020, then the sales for April 2020 have to be at least 30 per cent less\nthan April 2019). Refer to [the section on Eligible\nPeriods](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-\nplan/wage-subsidy.html) for further details. It sounds as though there may be\nsome flexibility in the approach to this calculation, and obviously employers\nthat have been in operation for less than a year will have to find a different\nway to satisfy this requirement.\n\nOrganizations that do not qualify for this wage subsidy may qualify for the\npreviously announced wage subsidy of 10 per cent of remuneration paid from\nMarch 18 to before June 20, 2020.\n\n**What?** The temporary wage subsidy will provide up to 75 per cent of gross\nregular wages to a maximum of $847 per week or $58,700 annually. There is no\nlimit on the total amount an employer can claim, as there is no limit on the\nsize of an employer which can benefit from this program.\n\nEligible remuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration for\nwhich employers would generally be required to withhold or deduct amounts on\naccount of the employee's income tax obligation. Notably, it does not include\nseverance pay or items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a\ncorporate vehicle.\n\n**When?** The temporary wage subsidy will apply for or up to 12 weeks,\nretroactive to March 15, 2020 and ending on June 9, 2020 unless it is\nextended. Employers will have to reapply each month for the subsidy.\n\nFunds are expected to be available to be paid to the employer in about six\nweeks from April 1, 2020 (around the middle of May 2020), which is\nsignificantly different from the 10 per cent wage subsidy announced earlier.\n\n**Why?** This program is designed \"to help employers hardest hit by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to keep and retain workers.\" This wage subsidy aims to\nprevent further job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously\nlaid off as a result of COVID-19, and help better position employers to more\neasily resume business-as-usual following the crisis.\n\nWhile the government has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide support\nto employers, it was done with the expectation that employers will do their\npart by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the health and well-being\nof their employees.\n\n**How?** Employers can apply online through the CRA portal which will be\navailable soon.\n\nThere have been indications that anyone who abuses the system would face\nsevere penalties, although it remains unclear what the penalties would look\nlike. There have also been indications that businesses must show that they are\ndoing everything they can to pay the remaining 25 per cent, but how this would\nbe applied remains unclear.\n\n**  Interaction with Canada Emergency Response Benefit **\n\nAn employer would not be eligible to claim the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy\nfor remuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a four-week\nperiod for which the employee is eligible for the Canada Emergency Response\nBenefit (CERB).\n\nEmployers that are not eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would\nstill be able to furlough employees who will receive the CERB of up to $2,000\na month. Accordingly, it appears that at any given time, for any specific\nemployee, either the CERB or the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy may be\napplicable, but not both.\n\n**Work-Sharing Program**\n\n**Who?** The Work-Sharing (WS) Program is for eligible employers and employees\nwhere the employer can demonstrate a recent decline in business activity of at\nleast 10 per cent that is directly or indirectly related to the impact of\nCOVID-19, and a temporary decrease of employee hours of work in the range of\n10 to 60 per cent.\n\nThere are multiple eligibility criteria that must be met for both the employer\nand the employees. To be eligible for a WS agreement, a business must:\n\n  * be a year-round business in Canada for at least one year,\n\n  * be a private business, a publicly held company or a not-for-profit organization\n\n  * have at least two employees in the WS unit.\n\nTo be eligible for WS, employees must:\n\n  * be \"core staff\",\n\n  * be eligible to receive EI benefits (see below)\n\n  * agree to reduce their normal working hours by the same percentage and to share the available work.\n\nThe eligibility requirement for WS is the same as for regular employment\ninsurance (EI) benefits, and employees must have 420 to 700 hours of insurable\nemployment during their qualifying period which is the 52 weeks prior to the\nstart of their EI benefit period.\n\nEmployers should consult the detailed eligibility criteria as well as the non-\neligibility criteria to determine whether or not their business or certain\nemployees qualify.\n\n**What?** The WS program provides EI benefits to eligible employees who agree\nto reduce their normal working hours and share the available work while their\nemployer recovers from the impact of COVID-19.\n\nFor most people, the basic rate for calculating EI benefits is 55 per cent of\ntheir average insurable weekly earnings, up to a maximum amount. As of Jan. 1,\n2020, the maximum yearly insurable earnings amount is $54,200. This means that\nthe employee can receive a maximum amount of $573 per week.\n\n**When?** COVID-19 temporary special measures are effective March 15, 2020 to\nMarch 14, 2021. The temporary special measures extend the qualifying weeks for\nthe WS program from 38 weeks to 76 weeks. The minimum duration is six weeks.\n\nAn application for a WS agreement must be submitted a minimum of 10 calendar\ndays prior to the requested start date, which is a significantly shortened\nperiod from the pre-COVID-19 30-day rule. All agreements must begin on a\nSunday.\n\nEmployees do not have to serve a waiting period for WS benefits. The EI\nbenefits are processed through the EI payment system.\n\n**Why?** The WS program is intended to help employers and employees avoid\nlayoffs when there is a temporary decrease in business activity beyond the\ncontrol of the employer. In particular, the WS program allows employers to\nretain talent, and allows employees to keep their jobs and maintain their job\nskills.\n\n**How?**  If you are applying for a new agreement, you must submit the\napplication 10 calendar days prior to the requested start date. Applications\ncan be sent to Service Canada by email at: [ESDC.ON.WS-\nTP.ON.EDSC@servicecanada.gc.ca](mailto:ESDC.ON.WS-\nTP.ON.EDSC@servicecanada.gc.ca).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the coming days, there will be further information regarding the various\ngovernment measures to support employers and employees. We will continue to\nmonitor the situation and encourage you to do the same. The bottom line is\nthat this situation was entirely unexpected and everyone is scrambling to\nadapt to it - businesses, individuals, and governments alike. Things are\nchanging rapidly; for example, many layoffs that seemed to be inevitable a\nweek ago have now been cancelled or at least postponed while everyone assesses\nthe options for support that are available.\n\nToo many businesses and individuals are making decisions without understanding\nthe legal implications. Know your rights so that every decision is an informed\none. Stay safe, and stay informed.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [This is all very frustrating, but is it frustration of contract?](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/this-is-all-very-frustrating-but-is-it-frustration-of-contract/328138)\n  * [Temporary layoffs not always allowed](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/temporary-layoffs-not-always-allowed/327849)\n  * [You can't wear that](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/you-cant-wear-that/327542)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

Learn how working with a PEO can help you provide\nthem with the best perks and benefits.\n\n  * Choosing a PEO solution with robust employee perks can help small businesses attract and keep valuable employees.\n  * Companies with the best benefits usually have comprehensive health insurance and retirement plans for their employees, and can PEOs generally offer better plans than those that small businesses could otherwise afford.\n  * In addition to employee benefits, PEOs provide small business owners with HR support and technology, including employee recruiting and trainings, payroll, and regulatory guidance. \n\nEnticing good employees to work for you can be challenging. While competitive\npay is important, so, too, is having an appealing benefits package. This is\nwhere a [professional employer\norganization](https://www.business.com/categories/best-peo-services/) (PEO)\nbecomes a great option for small businesses.\n\nPEOs serve small businesses that don't have substantial human resources teams\nby performing most of the standard HR responsibilities and tasks. They also\noffer top-notch benefits plans. This allows small business owners to focus on\ngrowing their companies by hiring top talent and building a solid workplace\nculture.\n\nThe perks that small businesses can offer their employees through a PEO can\nimprove employee morale, company culture and instill a better work-life\nbalance for employees. Creating a great place to work for employees can result\nin higher retention rates and positive employee reviews, which, in turn, can\nlead to a broader, stronger workforce.\n\n**Editor's note: Looking for the right PEO for your business? Fill out the\nbelow questionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you about your\nneeds.**\n\n## How PEOs help companies offer the best benefits\n\nPEOs can provide small businesses with benefits packages typically only\noffered by Fortune 500 companies. Employee benefits may include medical,\ndental, and vision insurance; hospital and accident insurance policies; life\nand group life insurance; a 401(k) retirement plan; tuition reimbursement;\nshort-term and long-term disability insurance; commuter benefits; and the\nability to work remotely.\n\nSmall businesses often can't afford to independently provide their employees\nwith the benefits that larger companies offer. However, they can work with a\nPEO that is affordable, according to Matt Diggity, CEO of [Diggity\nMarketing](https://diggitymarketing.com/).\n\n\"A PEO works with many small companies, so it becomes easy for them to help\n[a] small business's employees access medical, dental and vision coverage at\naffordable rates,\" Diggity told business.com. \"The collective number of\nemployees of different small companies is \u2026 equal to the employees of a big\nfirm, so PEOs harness the buying power generally reserved for much larger\nenterprises.\"\n\n## PEOs help employees understand their benefits\n\nIn addition to offering employees quality benefits, PEOs save harried business\nowners and staff time and cut through mountains of paperwork. For example,\nwhen it comes to annual enrollment alone, PEOs save business owners hours they\nwould otherwise spend researching benefit options, explaining those benefits\nto employees and then fielding employee questions.\n\n\"Employees no longer need to turn to overworked HR departments to get a\ncomprehensive understanding of what they're signing up for,\" said Gary\nStevens, front-end developer and founder of [Hosting\nCanada](https://hostingcanada.org/). \"Instead, any questions employees may\nhave can be turned directly to the PEO. Since one of their main functions is\nfinding the best plans available, employees no longer need to worry that\nthey're making a mistake during their yearly enrollment.\"\n\nChoosing a PEO solution that has high-quality employee perks can help boost\nemployee satisfaction. When your employees know they're receiving quality\nperks, they can focus on being productive members of your team.\n\n## Other HR benefits of using a PEO\n\n[A PEO](https://www.business.com/articles/peo-services/) performs many HR\ntasks, which can ease pressure on a company's internal HR staff and free up\nthe business owner's time to focus on more pressing matters within the\ncompany.\n\nShraga Jacobowitz, managing partner of [ARC PEO\nConsultants](https://www.arcpeo.com/), says small businesses can benefit from\nusing a PEO in four ways:\n\n  1. A PEO reduces employee-related costs, such as discounted employee benefit costs, workers' compensation costs and sometimes taxes.  \n  \n\n  2. It reduces a company's employee-related liability.  \n  \n\n  3. A PEO provides additional HR support and technology to its clients, including employee handbooks, training, and performance   \nmanagement; job descriptions, recruiting, and applicant tracking systems;\ngovernment compliance and regulatory guidance.  \n  \n\n  4. A PEO can provide an [HRIS](https://www.hrpayrollsystems.net/hris/), or human resource information system, to help small businesses manage their employees. \n\n## PEOs offer small businesses greater options with health insurance plans\n\nThe companies with the best benefits usually have comprehensive [health\ninsurance plans](https://www.business.com/categories/best-health-insurance-\nemployee-benefits/) for their employees. PEOs generally allow small businesses\nto offer their workers better health benefits than what they could otherwise\nprovide from standard employer-sponsored health insurance plans.\n\nAn additional advantage of having your health insurance sponsored by a PEO is\nthat the PEO is responsible for compliance related to administering health\ninsurance plans, according to Michael Roloson, founder of [PEO\nFocus](https://www.peofocus.com/).\n\n\"Most PEOs will offer access to master health plans or association health\nplans that allow for more cost consistency and predictability when it comes to\nhealth insurance costs and renewals each year,\" Roloson said. \"Other perks\ninclude offering multiple health insurance plan options, tiering employer\ncontributions by employee responsibility or tenure, and coupling options with\naccess to FSA and HSA plans without incurring additional costs or\nadministrative burden.\"\n\n## PEOs help small businesses offer good retirement plans\n\nThe companies with the best benefits generally have great [retirement\nplans](https://www.business.com/categories/best-employee-retirement-plans/),\nsuch as 401(k) plans that include profit-sharing contributions and\n[vesting](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-\nemployee/retirement-topics-vesting), which encourage employee retention. A PEO\nhelps small businesses provide good 401(k) plans to employees.\n\nPEOs assume fiduciary liability and sign all necessary compliance forms, which\ncan shield your company from potential legal issues associated with employee\nretirement plans.\n\n\"PEOs allow access to a multiple employer plan (MEP), which shifts compliance\nresponsibility to the PEO as a co-employer,\" Roloson said. \"In the event the\nfunds that employees have access to underperform in a way that severely\nimpacts retirement balances negatively, it is the PEO [that] would be\nresponsible in the event of litigation.\"\n\n## How does working with a PEO affect employee child care leave benefits?\n\nWhen an employee gives birth, fosters, or adopts a child, child care leave\nprovides them with a certain period of time in which new parents can\nrecuperate from childbirth and care for new family members. The best child\ncare benefits usually include maternity or paternity leave, sick leave, onsite\nchild care and [backup child care](https://workplace.care.com/what-is-backup-\ncare).\n\nUnder the [Family and Medical Leave\nAct](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla), eligible employees can take\nunpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical reasons with continuation\nof group health insurance. Being a federal law, this is not to be confused\nwith specified state laws or requirements regarding parental leave.\n\nFor example, New York's [paid parental\nleave](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/2020) benefit provides most New York\nState workers, including part-time employees, the right to take paid time off\nwithout losing their job or health insurance so they can welcome a new child\nor care for an ill family member.\n\nUsing a PEO that offers child care benefits for your employees gives them a\nsignificant reason to stay and work for your company, according to Simon\nHansen, founder of [HomeBrewAdvice](https://homebrewadvice.com/).\n\n\"As working parents no longer need to worry much about their children, they\nare more emotionally and mentally healthy,\" he said.\n\n## PEOs can streamline payroll processing and HR compliance\n\nA PEO can administer your\n[payroll](https://www.business.com/categories/online-payroll-services/), pay\npayroll taxes, maintain workers' compensation insurance and manage the regular\ncompensation of your employees.\n\nWhen a company uses a PEO for payroll processing, the PEO becomes co-employer\nand assumes the duties of managing the client's payroll-related tasks, such as\npaying wages depositing taxes and issuing employee W-2s.\n\nBelow are three advantages of using a PEO when it comes to managing payroll,\naccording to Nidhi Joshi, business consultant for [iFour Technolab Pvt\nLtd](https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/):\n\n  * **PEOs help your business stay current with regulations**. A PEO ensures that your company is always compliant. They do this by keeping tabs on ever-changing rules and regulations, and providing you with an action plan to help you stay in compliance.  \n  \n\n  *  **They handle compliance paperwork**. PEOs are experts on employment-related regulations. They know the paperwork you need to file, and, in certain cases, they can file it for you.  \n  \n ****\n\n  *  **PEOs help reduce your risk of liability**. A PEO gives you access to licensed HR professionals and attorneys who can help you lower your employment-related risks.\n\nWant more advice for your business?\n\nGet free tips from experts in our small business community.\n\nEnter your email address below.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA.

now\n\nBenefits can be a powerful tool to help you attract and retain the employees\nyour organization needs to succeed, especially in a tight job market and in\nfields where the competition for employees is particularly fierce, like\nnursing, skilled trades and software development.\n\nBut while employees still want robust health insurance plans and other\ntraditional benefits such as paid time off and retirement savings options,\nthey\u2019re also seeking newer benefits like financial wellness programs, help\nmanaging student loan debt, transit reimbursement and remote work options.\n\nBefore you decide to add to or change your benefits plan, consider several\nissues. Investing the time upfront to answer these questions from the\nperspective of the organization you are and the one you want to be can help\nyou build a better plan, one that will attract the employees you want and\nbuild loyalty towards your organization.\n\nA 2019 Met Life [_study_](https://www.metlife.com/employee-benefit-\ntrends/ebts-thriving-in-new-work-world-2019/) found that when benefits are\ncustomized to fit employee needs, not only are employees happier, they\u2019re also\nsignificantly more satisfied with their jobs, loyal to their employers, and\nengaged and productive at work. In addition, the study notes that better\nbenefits are a top employee desire \u2014 the third highest ranked request after\nsalary and a positive work environment \u2014 and six in 10 employees say benefits\nwere one of the deciding factors when taking a job.\n\n **Set your goals**  \nBefore making any decisions, think about your goals. What are you trying to\naccomplish by revamping your benefits plan? Are you trying to attract younger\nworkers or retain high skill employees? Cut turnover? Address employee\nconcerns or dissatisfaction with your current benefits? Change the perception\nof your organization in the marketplace and with potential employees? The\nanswers to these questions can help you decide which benefits make the most\nsense and which will be the best investment within your benefits budget.\n\n **Gather current employee input**  \nOnce your HR and leadership team have mapped out goals, get your employees\u2019\ninsights on current benefit offerings, offerings you\u2019re considering adding and\nbenefits that are on their wish list. You can gather this information several\ndifferent ways \u2014 informal surveys via email, benefits assessment\nquestionnaires and one-on-one or team conversations with employees are a few\noptions. The data you gather can be particularly helpful if the budget is\nlimited and you need to choose which benefit additions or changes will have\nthe greatest positive impact on morale, loyalty and recruiting.\n\n **Consider benefits that differentiate your organization**  \nWhile big tech companies have expanded the spectrum of benefits by adding new\nofferings like pet insurance and free food at work, that doesn\u2019t mean those\nwill resonate with your workforce. In addition to the benefits your current\nemployees are interested in, you may also want to think about adding benefits\nthat address some common employee issues and concerns and would make your\norganization stand out from the competition. Those benefits could include the\nfollowing:\n\n  *  _Increased access to virtual medical care_ : Virtual access is not only a convenient way for employees to get care for common problems like sore throats and colds, it can also be an effective way to expand and simplify access to second opinions for serious diagnoses and surgery recommendations and mental health care. \n\n  * _Support for healthcare decision making_ : The National Business Group on Health (NBGH) identified greater access to medical decision support tools as one of six benefits trends for 2020, noting that 78% of large employers plan to offer these as part of their benefits plan. In addition to second opinion programs, decision support tools can include access to medical specialists who gather and review medical records, provide objective information on the full range of appropriate treatment options, as well as access to medical billing specialists who can check bills for accuracy and advocate for employees with healthcare providers when billing errors are found. NBGH notes that 73% of the employers who provide these services will offer virtual access while 60% will provide full-service, concierge-style programs designed to help employees navigate the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system.\n\n  *  _Help caring for aging parents_ : While it\u2019s still not a widely adopted benefit, data gathered by the Society for Human Resource Management found approximately 10% of organizations offered eldercare benefits in 2019. This percentage is likely to increase as more employees in their prime earning years are called on to help aging parents and relatives.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee46f47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2358x2358+0+38/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F91%2F3c%2F07be6d3c4c7b82675e972ef04580%2Fmiles-\nvarn.jpg)

AI can not only make the\nenrollment process seamless, but provide the most personalized options for\nyour employees.\n\n\u201cMoving away from traditional once-a-year benefits selection to a year-round\nprocess ensures timely access to benefits as they are needed,\u201d Malme says. \u201cAI\nallows employers to engage with employees more regularly without adding\nadministrative burden to the HR or benefits administration team.\u201d\n\nAs benefit plans continue to adapt to the [diverse needs of the\nworkplace](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/benefits-plans-are-adapting-to-\nthe-demands-of-a-diverse-workplace), using data and technology to personalize\nthese options can simplify what is typically an extremely confusing process\nfor employees, Malme says. [Utilizing\ndata](https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/what-to-consider-when-changing-your-\nemployee-benefit-offerings) can help educate employees on the benefits that\nwill best suit their individual needs, so that their health, wealth and\nlifestyle are all incorporated into their benefit choices.\n\n\u201cAI can simplify benefits selection, purchase and use and effectively engage\nconsumers and improve their lives with benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are numerous\nlife events that can trigger AI-powered smart moments and present relevant\noptions.\u201d\n\nMalme discussed how AI will play a role in benefits selection and how making\nenrollment more fluid and year-round can ensure financial well-being for\nemployees.\n\n**Why should healthcare benefits be a year-round discussion in the\nworkplace?**\n\nThe simplest answer is individuals don\u2019t live life two weeks out of the year\nduring open enrollment. Life happens every day, and the business of benefits\nhas to evolve to be employee and consumer friendly and a year-round engagement\nto help them through planned and unexpected life moments.\n\nWe live in an on-demand society, and we need to transform how benefits are\nbought, sold and used. The benefits industry operates in a decades-old\nparadigm where benefits are imposed on consumers or not offered at all. For\nthose who do have options, the open enrollment process has them make 15 to 20\nor more complex financial decisions once a year. Making those decisions\nrequires significant knowledge and insight. To get it right, consumers need to\nunderstand their budget, remember the past, predict the future, calculate\nrisk, all while navigating industry jargon. It\u2019s no wonder employees and\nfamilies struggle with the process.\n\n**How can these ongoing considerations benefit an employee\u2019s financial\nhealth?**\n\nWith a consumer-driven benefits strategy, employers have the opportunity to\nprovide new benefits and valuable options in those moments that matter.\nEmployees have the choice to increase their life insurance and add a\nbeneficiary with the birth of a child. They have the choice to select and\ninvest in a 529 Plan versus buying an Xbox. They have a choice to spend a few\ndollars on pet insurance to avoid the financial stress that would otherwise\ncome with pet illness.\n\nOne of the most important things for an employee is to have the resources they\nneed to manage their health, wealth and lifestyle. Four out of 10 Americans\nwould not be able to cover a $1,000 emergency expense and 1 out of 4 adults\nskipped necessary medical care in 2018 because they could not afford the cost.\n\n**How can AI help personalize benefits for these specific employee needs?**\n\nAI can assist and guide employees as they analyze and make decisions to ensure\nthey are choosing benefits that are personally relevant for their life stage\nand lifestyle. BenefitSAIGE, our AI-powered platform, leverages the\ndifferentiated data integrated into our platform to deliver a hyper-\npersonalized benefits experience. This experience is designed to better\neducate employees to ensure effective benefits selection and usage. As an\nexample, an employee about to go on maternity leave may be prompted to\nconsider grocery delivery to spend more time with her new baby. Finally, AI\ncan eliminate and automate mundane manual tasks so HR leaders and\nadministrators can focus their time on what matters most: employees.\n\n **How is AI currently being used when it comes to enrollment and healthcare\nutilization?**\n\nBenefitfocus integrates AI throughout our entire consumer benefits platform\nfrom open enrollment and year-round communication to analyzing selection and\nclaims data throughout the year to offer benefits that employees really need\nand want.\n\nAI and analytics enable benefits administrators to make more accurate, data-\ndriven decisions in their benefits strategy, while monitoring plan utilization\nand member health. In addition, these tools may be used to identify, compare\nand customize plans to deliver optimal employee coverage at the best possible\nprice. Finally, AI improves communication between employees and an employer by\nproviding a singular point of control.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e061e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x1200+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F5f%2Fee%2F450d602848d39d4a92b4b6010219%2Funnamed-1.jpg)\n](https://www.employeebenefitadviser.com/author/alyssa-place)\n\n[Alyssa

Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nIn view of the evolving COVID-19 situation, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM),\nthe National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and the Singapore National\nEmployers Federation (SNEF) have jointly\n[updated](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/0311-tripartite-\npartners-update-advisory-on-managing-excess-manpower-and-responsible-\nretrenchment) the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and\nResponsible Retrenchment (Advisory).\n\nWith businesses suffering sharp declines in volume and revenue in some\nsectors, some employers have started to implement cost-saving measures. The\nnew update aims to provide clearer guidance to affected employers on the\nappropriate measures to manage excess manpower.\n\nSharing the Advisory in a [Facebook\npost](https://www.facebook.com/PatrickTayTG/posts/2716345621733835), NTUC\nAssistant Secretary-General Patrick Tay said: \"In short, we urge companies to\nleverage on the various training and skills upgrading initiatives and funding\nto send workers for these programmes if there is excess manpower or downtime.\n\n\"Likewise, there are various measures such as a flexible work schedule for\nemployers to adopt. Together with the Budget 2020 support measures, I hope\nemployers will cut costs to save jobs and not cut jobs to save\ncosts\u2026.retrenchment(s) should only be the last and final option and if needed\nbe done fairly, responsibly and in a progressive manner.\"\n\n### Here are the key things to note:\n\n**Instead of retrenchment, implement a Flexible Work Schedule (FWS)**\n\nA FWS would allow companies to optimise the use of manpower when they go\nthrough cyclical troughs and peaks, and employees are assured of a stable\nmonthly income.\n\nAs businesses slow during this period, consider creating a \u201ctimebank\u201d of\nunused working hours by reducing weekly working hours and using them to offset\nfuture overtime pay when working hours increase in subsequent periods.\n\nIn offsetting future overtime pay, the employee (or union if company is\nunionised) and employer may agree on the rate at which the accrued hours are\nto be valued. Employers who wish to implement FWS need to seek the support of\nthe employees (and union if company is unionised) and thereafter apply to the\nCommissioner for Labour.\n\n**Employers required to inform MOM on any cost-saving measures from 12 March**\n\nWith effect from today (12 March 2020), employers are also required to notify\nMOM if they implement any cost-saving measures during this period that affects\nthe employees\u2019 monthly salaries, and indicate that they have done so fairly.\nThe new requirement applies to employers with 10 or more employees and is\nintended to be a temporary measure until the economy recovers.\n\n**Focus on training and upskilling to benefit both employees and the\nbusiness**\n\nThe Advisory also highlights that during a business downturn, focusing on\ntraining and upskilling greatly benefits both employers and employees.\nEmployers will be able to retain skilled employees to enable the company to\nmeet business demand when demand rebounds. Employees can also take the\nopportunity to update themselves with better skills and knowledge to improve\ntheir productivity.\n\nThe Government provides significant support to employers who are prepared to\ninvest and develop capabilities in their employees. Employers can tap on\ntraining support schemes under the SkillsFuture movement, redeployment\nprogrammes under the Adapt and Grow initiative, and other government grants.\n\nDuring the announcement of [Budget\n2020](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-budget-2020-key-\ntakeaways-for-hr-leaders-and-employers/) last month, Deputy Prime Minister\nHeng Swee Keat rolled out a Stabilisation and Support Package which aims to\nstabilise the economy and support workers and enterprises, by helping workers\nto stay in their jobs and enterprises with cash flow. The government will\nprovide additional help to sectors more directly affected by the outbreak.\n\nJust yesterday, he shared that a second stimulus package is in the works, with\na key aspect being to help workers keep their jobs. According to a [_CNA_\nreport](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/second-stimulus-\npackage-in-the-works-as-global-economy-covid-19-12527974), the new package\nwill also include specific measures to help those who are retrenched, as well\nas ways to better support self-employed people who have been affected by the\nnovel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nCommenting on the [updated Advisory](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2020/0311-tripartite-partners-update-advisory-on-managing-excess-\nmanpower-and-responsible-retrenchment), Koh Juan Kiat, Executive Director,\nSNEF, noted that the updated Advisory offered useful options for employers to\ncope with the current business downturn arising from COVID-19. He said:\n\"Businesses will differ in their operation and financial circumstances. As\nsuch they should evaluate the options and notify MOM after their adoption.\nThis information will help the tripartite partners to better appreciate the\nground and decide on further targeted support for employers and employees.\u201d\n\nThen Yee Thoong, Divisional Director of Labour Relations and Workplaces\nDivision, MOM, added: \"In sectors affected by COVID-19, tripartite partners\nrecognise that businesses may need to implement cost-saving measures as they\nstrive to keep afloat. I strongly encourage employers to study the Advisory,\nincluding the Annex of the Advisory that lays out the measures ordered in\nterms of severity of impact on employees\u2019 livelihood, and work with their\nunions and employees on a set of mutually agreeable measures. Working\ntogether, we will be able to save jobs and overcome the impact of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe [updated tripartite\nadvisory](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/employment-\npractices/guidelines/tripartite-advisory-on-managing-excess-manpower-and-\nresponsible-retrenchment.pdf) reiterates that retrenchment is always the last\nresort.\n\nInstead, employers should try these alternatives (arranged by severity of\nimpact on employees' livelihood and work):\n\n  * Send employees for training to upgrade their skills and employability.\n  * Redeploy employees to alternative areas of work within the company.\n  * Implement a flexible work schedule, flexible work arrangements, a shorter workweek, or temporary layoff.\n  * Adjust wages in line with tripartite norms.\n  * Implement no-pay leave.\n\nIn the event where retrenchment is inevitable, companies should implement\nretrenchment exercises in a responsible and sensitive manner bearing in mind\nthe impact on the affected employees.\n\n**Here are the six key points to keep in mind when carrying out a retrenchment\nexercise:**\n\n**#1 Selection of employees for retrenchment should be conducted fairly**\n\nAn objective criteria should be used, such as the ability of the employee to\ncontribute to the company's future business needs. There should be **no\ndiscrimination** against any particular group on grounds of age, race, gender,\nreligion, marital status and family responsibility, or disability. Employers\nshould abide by the [Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment\nPractices](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/fair/tripartite-\nguidelines). Complaints of discriminatory practices will be investigated and\nenforcement actions will be taken for substantiated complaints, such as\ncurtailing work pass privileges of the employer.\n\n**#2 Notify the MOM and unions of the retrenchment exercise**\n\nIf the company is unionised, the relevant union(s) should be consulted as\nearly as possible, and at least one month before notifying the employee.\nEmployers must comply with the Mandatory Retrenchment Notifications\nrequirement under the Employment Act.\n\n**#3 Communication to employees:**\n\nEmployers should communicate the intentions of retrenchment to their employees\nearly and before the public notice of retrenchment is given. This may include:\n\n  * Explaining the business situation faced by the company resulting in the need for a retrenchment exercise.\n  * Outlining how the retrenchment exercise will be carried out.\n  * Elaborating on the factors that will be considered.\n  * Specifying the assistance being offered to those affected.\n\nWhen issuing the retrenchment notice, employers should be sensitive to the\nemotional needs of affected employees. Where necessary, counselling support\nshould be considered and offered.\n\n**#4 Retrenchment notice period to affected employees**\n\nEmployers should provide a longer notice period, to the extent practicable, to\ngive the affected employees time to prepare for and look for alternative\narrangements. According to the Employment Act, the following notice periods\nare a minimum requirement:\n\n  * Less than 26 weeks in service: 1 day\n  * 26 weeks to less than 2 years in service: 1 week\n  * 2 years to less than 5 years in service: 2 weeks\n  * 5 years and above in service: 4 weeks\n\nHowever, the guideline encourages employers to adopt a longer retrenchment\nnotice period when compared to the normal termination of an employment\ncontract, or to pay in lieu of such notice. This should be worked out with the\nunion(s) in the collective agreement concerned, with employees in their\ncontracts of service, or codified in their company HR handbooks.\n\nEmployers should also pay all wages due and retrenchment benefit to the\naffected employees by the last day of work.\n\n**#5 Provide retrenchment benefit**\n\nEmployees with 2 years\u2019 service or more are eligible for retrenchment benefit\nwhile those with less than 2 years\u2019 service could be granted an ex-gratia\npayment.\n\nThe amount of retrenchment benefit depends on what is provided for in the\nemployment contract. If there is no provision, it needs to be negotiated\nbetween the employees (via their union in the case of a unionised company) and\nthe employer concerned.\n\nThe prevailing norm is to pay a retrenchment benefit varying between 2 weeks\nto one month salary per year of service, depending on the financial position\nof the company and taking into consideration the industry norm.\n\nHowever, in unionised companies where the amount of retrenchment benefit is\nstipulated in the collective agreement, the norm is one month\u2019s salary for\neach year of service.\n\nIf the retrenchment exercise follows shortly after a salary cut, the salary\nprior to the cut should be used to compute the retrenchment benefit, so that\ncuts are not implemented just to reduce retrenchment payments.\n\n**#6 Provide employment facilitation **\n\nEmployers are also encouraged to help affected employees find alternative jobs\nin associate companies, in other companies, or through outplacement assistance\nprogrammes.\n\nEmployers are urged to go beyond advisory assistance and make practicable\nefforts to place affected employees in their next jobs, possibly with the help\nof intermediaries such as employment/placement agencies.\n\nSupporting documentation (such as referral letters, service records and past\ntraining certificates) should also be provided where relevant to facilitate\nthe job search of affected employees.\n\nTo provide employment facilitation services for affected employees, employers\ncan work with the unions, SNEF and agencies such as WSG, NTUC\u2019s Employment and\nEmployability Institute (e2i), Job Security Council and U PME Centre.\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com/)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

With employers facing the prospect of\ngovernment-mandated business closures and employees who need time off to care\nfor children unexpectedly home for multiple weeks due to school closures,\nCOVID-19 presents numerous employee benefit-related questions and challenges.\nThis _Alert_ will provide employers with a roadmap for addressing COVID-19\nconcerns that affect health insurance plans (including potential HIPAA privacy\nobligations thereunder), welfare benefit plans and retirement plans.\n\n### Health Insurance Plans\n\n### _Applicable Large Employers Under the Affordable Care Act_\n\nApplicable large employers under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (ACA)\u2015 _i.e._ , employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent\nemployees\u2015must ensure compliance with the ACA's rules regarding the continued\noffering of coverage during stability periods. Employees who were deemed to be\neligible for health insurance coverage during the employer's measurement\nperiod\u2015due to meeting the ACA's 30 hours per week threshold\u2015must remain\neligible for coverage during the subsequent stability period, even if hours\nare reduced. This would include a reduction in hours in response to the\ncoronavirus.\n\n### _Small Employers Under the Affordable Care Act_\n\nFor employers who are not applicable large employers under the ACA\u2014 _i.e._ ,\nemployers with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees\u2014these rules will\nnot be applicable. Whether coverage will continue during a business closure\nfor smaller employers will depend on the terms of the employer's individual\ninsurance contract. For example, if the insurance contract provides for\ncoverage during a leave period, the employee will remain eligible during the\nbusiness closure (up to the maximum period specified in the insurance\ncontract).\n\n### _Premiums_\n\nAll employers\u2015whether they are subject to the ACA's stability period rules or\nnot\u2015will need to determine how best to collect premiums from employees during\nany period of business closure. To the extent the employees continue to be\npaid during the business closure, payroll deductions can continue for\nemployees that have previously elected coverage. However, if the leave is\nunpaid, then the employer will need to communicate with employees regarding\nthe need to pay the required portion of their premiums. Employers generally\nhave three options: (1) have employees prepay the required premiums; (2) have\nemployees \"pay-as-they-go\" with respect to the required premiums; or (3) have\nemployees pay the required premiums upon their return to work.\n\n### _COBRA_\n\nEmployers should be mindful of their obligations under the Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). To the extent that there is no loss\nof coverage as a result of the business closure, there will be no obligation\nto provide employees with the ability to elect COBRA. However, to the extent\nthat there is a loss of coverage as a result of the business closure\u2015for\nexample, due to a termination of employment or a reduction in hours\u2015then the\nimpacted employees should be provided with the required COBRA notice. Small\nemployers that are not subject to COBRA should also be mindful of any mini-\nCOBRA obligations in their state or jurisdiction.\n\n### HIPAA Privacy Obligations\n\nIn the context of the coronavirus outbreak, employers should continue to\nfollow their existing HIPAA privacy policies and procedures. However,\nemployers are reminded that the HIPAA privacy rules apply to \"covered\nentities.\" With respect to an employer offering health insurance to its\nemployees, the covered entity is the employer's group health plan and not the\nemployer itself. As a result, the disclosure of a positive coronavirus\ndiagnosis from an employee would not be \"protected health information\" under\nHIPAA because the information did not originate from the group health plan.\nTherefore, the employer's decision to inform other employees of the positive\ndiagnosis would not raise HIPAA privacy issues.\n\n### _Further Considerations_\n\nEmployers should be aware that while HIPAA will not be implicated by such a\ndisclosure by an employee, the employer must consider its obligations under\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable local, state\nand federal privacy laws when making a decision about the scope of its\ndisclosure to others in the workplace about the diagnosis. By way of example,\nthe CDC states in its published [Interim Guidance for Businesses and\nEmployers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-\nbusiness-\nresponse.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-\ngroups%2Fguidance-business-response.html \"Interim Guidance for Businesses and\nEmployers\") that if an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers\nshould inform other employees of their possible workplace exposure to\nCOVID-19, but maintain confidentiality ( _e.g._ , not identify by specific\nname) as required by the ADA.\n\n### Welfare Benefit Plans\n\nEmployee eligibility under other welfare benefit programs may also be impacted\nduring a business closure related to the coronavirus. This may include (among\nother offerings) eligibility under an employer's short-term disability, long-\nterm disability or life insurance contracts.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to review their existing contracts and policies with\nrespect to such welfare benefit programs to determine the impact of any\nbusiness closure. For example, if an employee remains employed during the\nbusiness closure on a designated leave, the employer should become familiar\nwith the impact of such a leave in terms of eligibility for short-term\ndisability benefits.\n\n### Retirement Plan Benefits\n\n### _401(k) Deferrals_\n\nTo the extent that an employee is paid during any period of business closure,\nthe employer should continue to withhold elective deferrals under its 401(k)\nplan and timely remit those contributions.\n\nTo the extent that employees are not paid during a period business closure,\n401(k) plan contributions (both employee and employer) would cease as there is\nno underlying compensation for purposes of the plan.\n\n### _Suspension of Discretionary Contributions_\n\nEmployers may also be contemplating a suspension in their employer\ncontributions as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. If employer\ncontributions are entirely discretionary, then employers have the ability to\nsuspend employer contributions at any time.\n\n### _Suspension of Fixed Contributions_\n\nFor employers with fixed employer contributions, it is important to consider\nthe individual 401(k) plan's provisions regarding eligibility for the employer\ncontributions. If an employee has already satisfied the requirements to\nreceive an employer contribution, that right cannot be eliminated\nretroactively. In other words, the employer may not remove contributions from\nparticipants who have already qualified for the contribution.\n\n### _Suspension of Safe Harbor Contributions_\n\nEmployers sponsoring a safe 401(k) harbor plan face additional restrictions on\ntheir ability to suspend employer contributions. Employers are only permitted\nto suspend or reduce nonelective or matching safe harbor contributions if the\nemployer is operating at an economic loss or a supplemental safe harbor notice\nis provided. The supplemental notice must be provided at least 30 days before\nthe suspension or reduction takes effect and provide eligible employees with\nthe opportunity to change their contribution elections.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs with all issues related to the coronavirus, those outlined in this _Alert_\nare in constant motion and employers are encouraged to seek legal counsel to\nensure that all applicable rules and regulations are followed. This is\nparticularly important in light of any future legislation from Congress that\naddresses the coronavirus and its impact on employers and employees.\n\n### About Duane Morris\n\nDuane Morris Benefits and Executive Compensation attorneys are available to\nassist employers in any way with respect to the novel and unique issues\narising with respect to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nFurthermore, the Duane Morris [COVID-19 Strategy\nTeam](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/coronavirus_covid_19Roster.html\n\"Team Roster\") is advising clients on all aspects of the [legal implications\nof\nCOVID-19](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/coronavirus_covid_19.html\n\"legal implications of COVID-19\"), including contractual, employment,\ninsurance and healthcare issues.\n\nWe are also offering the following\n[webinar](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=http://duanemorrisinstitute.com/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-what-employers-should-do-now-and-business-continuity-planning/\n\"COVID-19 webinars\") through the Duane Morris Institute:\n\n  * [Coronavirus (COVID-19): Business Continuity Planning for a Pandemic](https://university2.learnlive.com/University/DMI/CatalogItem/2324640/2952205#Overview \"Duane Morris Institute webinar registration\")\n\n### For Further Information\n\nIf you have any questions about this _Alert_ , please contact any of the [\nattorneys](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/employeebenefitsandexecutivecompensationRoster.html\n\"Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation Group attorney roster\") in our\n[Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation\nGroup](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/employeebenefitsandexecutivecompensation.html\n\"Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation Group\"), any of the [\nattorneys](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/employmentlaborbenefitsandimmigrationRoster.html\n\"Employment, Labor, Benefits and Immigration Practice Group attorney roster\")\nin our [ Employment, Labor, Benefits and Immigration Practice\nGroup](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/practices/employmentlaborbenefitsandimmigration.html\n\"Employment, Labor, Benefits and Immigration Practice Group\"), any member of\nthe [COVID-19 Strategy\nTeam](/redirection.asp?article_id=906674&company_id=21358&redirectaddress=https://www.duanemorris.com/site/covid-19_coronavirus_disease_2019.html#tab_DuaneMorrisCOVID19StrategyTeam\n\"COVID-19 Strategy Team\") or the attorney in the firm with whom you are\nregularly in contact.\n\n**_Disclaimer:_** _This Alert has been prepared and published for\ninformational purposes only and is not offered, nor should be construed, as\nlegal advice.

Many offices and work sites\nare increasingly uninhabited as a result of \"stay at home\" orders such as\nthose issued in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,\nLouisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio,\nOregon, Washington and West Virginia; orders directing all nonessential\nbusinesses to close such as those issued in Maryland, Nevada, Kentucky and\nVirginia; Georgia's order requiring \"medical fragile\" employees to shelter in\nplace; Kansas' mandatory quarantine for its residents who recently traveled to\ncertain identified states; and similar measures taken by local governments. As\na result, many employees are now working from home.\n\nThis article describes key employment laws and measures that employers need to\nconsider while their employees are working from home.\n\n### Make sure employees record time worked.\n\nTo comply with the wage-and-hour requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA) and your state's applicable wage-and-hour laws, it is imperative that\n_most_ (if not all) employees record their hours worked. Specifically,\nnonexempt hourly employees ( _i.e._ , those who are entitled to minimum and\novertime pay) need to track the time they spend performing compensable work so\nthat the amount of regular and overtime pay to which they are entitled can be\ncalculated.\n\nThe\n**[regulations](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2018-title29-vol3/pdf/CFR-2018-title29-vol3-sec516-2.pdf)**\npromulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) require that employers\ncovered by the FLSA maintain records for each nonexempt employee, which\ninclude but are not limited to hours worked each day and total hours worked\nduring each workweek.\n\nThe DOL's regulations do not require covered employers track the hours worked\nby exempt employees; nor does federal law prohibit employers from tracking\nexempt employees' hours. In fact, in its **[preamble to the 2004 final\nregulations](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-04-23/pdf/04-9016.pdf#page=42)**\n, the DOL states that employers may require exempt employees to record and\ntrack hours and to work a specified schedule.\n\nState law, however, may require employers to record hours worked by all\nemployees, including those who are exempt. In Illinois, for example, the\n**[Illinois Department of Labor's Administrative\nCode](http://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/056/056003000C06300R.html)**\ngoverning the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act (IWPCA) requires that\nevery employer maintain records for all employees, irrespective of their\nstatus as exempt, including the hours they work each day and in each workweek.\nEmployers should review their applicable state laws to determine what record-\nkeeping obligations exist at the state level.\n\nEven if not required by law, there may be valid reasons for tracking exempt\nemployees' hours worked on, for example, client billing, determining Family\nMedical Leave Act (FMLA) eligibility, or calculating 401(k) plan accounts,\nhealth insurance hours-based benefits and paid time off (PTO) benefits, among\nothers.\n\nAlso, time records may be necessary to manage particular exemptions. For\nemployees who are exempt only from overtime requirements but not minimum wage,\nrecords of hours worked are necessary to ensure employees were paid minimum\nwage. As another example, the overtime exemption for commission-paid employees\nof a retail or service establishment requires that the employee's regular\nhourly rate of pay in a workweek must be more than 1.5 times the FLSA's\nminimum wage.\n\nFinally, not all employers' time-keeping systems are accessible by employees\nworking from home. In this circumstance, employers should implement a policy\nthat requires employees to track their time using another reliable method.\n\n### Make sure nonexempt employees do not perform work off the clock.\n\nThere are new challenges for employers in not having direct oversight of\nemployees working from home, many for the first time. Employers must therefore\ntake action to ensure that nonexempt employees are not performing work off the\nclock and not working overtime without authorization.\n\nEmployers must count as hours worked the time employees perform work, even at\nhome, if the employer knows or has reason believe that the work is being\nperformed. Therefore, if an hourly, nonexempt employee is sending work emails\nto his or her supervisor while off the clock, the employer may be charged with\nknowing the employee performed work for which he or she was not compensated.\n\n### Ensure employees take meal and rest breaks as required under applicable\nlaw.\n\nMany states have laws mandating meal and rest breaks, along with requirements\nfor breaks for women who are breastfeeding. Employers should consult with\ntheir applicable state laws to ensure their employees are adhering to meal and\nrest break laws while working from home. Indeed, the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act enacted in 2010 amends the\n**[FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/73-flsa-break-time-\nnursing-mothers)** requiring certain employers to provide nursing mothers with\nreasonable break time to express breast milk.\n\nThe **[FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/breaks)** does not\nrequire employers provide meal or rest breaks to employees; however, under the\nFLSA, employees must be paid for rest breaks that last 20 minutes or less, and\nthese short breaks are to be included when determining if employees work\novertime. Employers do not need to pay employees for meal breaks that last 30\nminutes or more provided employees are relieved of all work duties during the\nmeal break.\n\n![913404a.jpg](/images/article_images/913404a.jpg)\n\n### Depending on applicable state law, employees may need to be reimbursed for\nbusiness expenses incurred while working from home.\n\nEmployees who moved from working exclusively or primarily in an employer-\nprovided office to working at home may incur expenses in connection with their\nwork.\n\nMany states, including\n**[California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2802.&lawCode=LAB)**\n,\n**[Illinois](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/082001150K9.5.htm)**\n, **[Iowa](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ico/chapter/91A.pdf)** ,\n**[Massachusetts](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section148)**\n, **[Montana](http://www.mtrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?RN=24%2E16%2E2519)** ,\nNew York and Pennsylvania, as well as the **[District of\nColumbia](https://does.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/does/publication/attachments/DOES_wage_hour_rules.pdf)**\n, have enacted laws requiring employers to reimburse employees for all or\ncertain necessary expenditures or losses incurred in the discharge of the\nemployee's duties that primarily benefit the employer.\n\nSpecific business expenses that employees may incur while working from home\ninclude home office expenses, cell phone/data plan expenses and wireless\ninternet expenses \u2013 in addition to expenses not unique to work from home\narrangements during this pandemic, such as mileage, business travel and\ncustomer or client entertainment.\n\nEmployers should review the business expense reimbursement laws in their\njurisdiction and update their policies as necessary so that they are compliant\nwith applicable state law and address their current business practices.\n\n### Employers need to consider whether work-related injuries or illnesses\nsustained by employees while working from home are recordable or reportable\nunder OSHA.\n\nIn addition to the DOL's OSHA **[Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for\nCOVID-19](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf)** , as more\nemployees may be required to work from home, it is a good time for employers\nto review OSHA's regulations as they relate to worked-related injuries or\nillnesses sustained by employees working from home.\n\nOSHA's **[regulations](https://www.osha.gov/laws-\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.7)** require many employers with\nmore than 10 employees to record any work-related injury or illness on an OSHA\n300 Log if it results in death, days away from work, restricted work or\ntransfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid or loss of\nconsciousness, or if it involves a significant injury or illness diagnosed by\na physician or other licensed health care professional.\n\nOSHA also requires employers to record work-related injuries involving\n**[medical removal](https://www.osha.gov/laws-\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.9)** , **[occupational hearing\nloss](https://www.osha.gov/laws-\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.10)** and **[work-related\ntuberculosis](https://www.osha.gov/laws-\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.11)**. In addition, employers are\nrequired to report work-related incidents that result in death within 8 hours,\nand to report work-related incidents resulting in amputation, loss of an eye\nor hospitalization within 24 hours.\n\n**[OSHA's regulations](https://www.osha.gov/laws-\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.5)** provide that injuries sustained\nby employees while working from home are work related \"if the injury or\nillness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation\nin the home, and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance\nof work rather than to the general home environment or setting.\"\n\nThe regulations provide the following examples:\n\n![913404b.jpg](/images/article_images/913404b.jpg)\n\nEmployers require employees to immediately report all injuries or illnesses\nsustained in connection with the furtherance of their job duties at the\nworksite _and_ at home. Such requirement ensures that employers are in a\nposition to comply with their OSHA recording and reporting obligations, and\nmay protect employees' rights under their states' respective workers'\ncompensation laws.\n\n### Employers should document when employees are unable to perform all of the\nessential duties of their job while working from home.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), qualified individuals with a\ndisability are entitled to reasonable accommodations that will enable them to\nperform the essential duties of their job provided the accommodations do not\ncause an undue hardship on their employers. Based on the facts and\ncircumstances, working from home may be a reasonable accommodation.\n\nDuring this pandemic, many employees are working from home even though they\nare not able to perform all of the essential duties of their job. In these\ninstances, it is advisable that employers make it clear in writing that they\nare permitting employees to work from home to assist in fighting the spread of\nthe COVID-19 virus, even though the employees are unable to perform all of the\nessential duties of their job.\n\nThis caveat will assist employers in the event any employees seek\naccommodations under the ADA to work from home after the pandemic is over, and\nrefer to the fact that the employer permitted them to do so during the\npandemic.\n\n### When nonexempt employees are \"on call\" while at home, employers need to\ndetermine if the \"on call\" time is compensable.\n\nThere may be situations where employers require their employees who are at\nhome to be \"on call\" to respond to specific business needs.\n\nThe DOL's\n**[regulations](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2009-title29-vol3/pdf/CFR-2009-title29-vol3-part785-subpartC-\nsubjectgroup-id1890.pdf)** provide, \"An employee who is not required to remain\non the employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at his home or\nwith the company officials where he may be reached is not working while on\ncall.\" An employee in this scenario is waiting to be engaged and does not need\nto be compensated under the FLSA.\n\nDuring instances when employees are completely relieved from their duties for\nperiods of time that are long enough to enable them to use the time for their\nown purposes are not hours worked. Employees are not completely relieved from\ntheir duties and cannot use the time effectively for their own purposes unless\nthey are definitely told in advance that they may leave the job and they will\nnot need to commence work until a definitively set time. Whether the time is\nlong enough to allow the employee to use the time effectively for his own\npurposes depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\nEmployers should give consideration to whether the particular facts and\ncircumstances of an employee's work arrangement is such that the employee is\n\"waiting to be engaged\" \u2013 time for which he/she does not need to be\ncompensated. However, if employees are prevented from using time at home for\ntheir own purposes, they would need to be compensated. This may involve an\nexamination of the frequency of phone calls or emails that need to be\naddressed, and whether they interfere with the employee's ability to spend\ntime performing nonbusiness tasks of his or her choice.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Here are five ways to make\norganizing a wellness program easier, writes Paul O\u2019Reilly-Hyland, CEO of\nZeamo**_ \u200b.\n\nThe benefits of offering employee wellness programs have been well proven in\nresearch and practice. Not only have they become a [must-\nhave](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/08/27/win-\nwith-wellness-attract-and-retain-\ntalent/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9WG7Zd7UxHe5P3KozmYvWMkaSi_5mLCxOfuyisRNC-\nFnDEqvItCVF_cyL7JDD0hqkpH_kL#42823a1a1648) for attracting and retaining\ntalent, but wellness programs also have a measurable impact on employee work\nperformance, productivity, motivation, and focus.\n\nOf course, all of this can translate into substantial benefits for the company\nwhen it comes to helping to reduce turnover, absenteeism, and\n[burnout](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/battling-\nburnout-4-ways-healthcare-companies-can-reduce-burnout/), and [lowering the\ncost of healthcare](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/09/take-the-\nmoney-and-run?fsrc=scn/li/te/bl/ed/takethemoneyandrunbartleby), potentially\nsaving U.S. companies as much as $6 billion a year in healthcare expenditures\nby 2025.\n\nThe problem is, offering and administering [wellness\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/untapped-\npossibilities-of-corporate-wellness/) can be cumbersome and time-consuming.\nAlong with all the other things HR is tasked with, wellness is often piled on\ntop. Of course, it makes sense, given the relationship to performance,\ncompensation, benefits, etc. But, that doesn\u2019t make it any less work,\nespecially as ever-changing compliance mandates and new policy implementations\nput increasing strain on resources that are already stretched thin.\n\n**Learn More:[2 Ways AI is Transforming Wellness in the\nWorkplace](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/2-ways-\nai-is-transforming-wellness-in-the-workplace/)**\n\nFortunately, technology can come to your rescue. Rather than fiddling with\nspreadsheets and manual reimbursement plans, implementing an employee wellness\nmanagement platform can help any size organization deliver excellent [wellness\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-\nwellness/strengthen-your-company-wellness-programs-with-wearables/) that\nattract, engage and retain employees while alleviating the stress and workload\nfor HR. Here\u2019s how:\n\n  1. **Anywhere gym access:** With today\u2019s distributed, mobile, and remote workforce, offering a membership discount at a single local gym or fitness facility isn\u2019t enough. Employees need more choice and flexibility, or they simply won\u2019t take advantage of the program. Partnering with a platform can open up an extensive network of facilities to your employees, saving you the hassle of enrollment fees, negotiating with multiple gyms and contract management. Employees can simply walk into any member facility wherever they live, work, or travel.  \n\n  2. **Streaming on-demand classes:** Sometimes physically going to the gym isn\u2019t an option, and some may just prefer to work out in the privacy of their own home or hotel room. Using a platform that provides streaming on-demand workout classes can give employees the freedom to work out when and how they want, with the added benefit of being able to try new things. All it takes is launching an app on their mobile device, and they\u2019re ready to get fit.  \n\n  3. **Built-in rewards:** Offering incentives for participation is a strong motivator for employees to take advantage of [wellness benefits](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/employees-are-looking-for-more-how-to-meet-heightened-benefits-expectations/). Offering tangible [rewards](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/how-to-make-unbiased-meritbased-employee-promotion-decisions-with-data/), like concert tickets, travel discounts, and other perks, has been proven to triple employee participation. But, managing that in-house would be a nightmare. Instead, working with a wellness platform provider can streamline the process by allowing the provider to do all the heavy lifting necessarily. Employees use the platform to check-in at the gym; the platform records their progress, negotiates with award suppliers, and automatically issues the bonuses when employees meet the designated milestones. This way, employees get the incentives they want, without the headaches for HR.  \n\n  4. **Participation metric:** Aside from tracking participation for rewards purposes, companies may also want to stay up-to-date on participation data to measure the ROI of their programs. Some may also want to tie the involvement to other benefit incentives, such as reduced healthcare premiums. Using a platform that automatically tracks and reports employee wellness participation can be constructive, saving HR a tremendous amount of time in figuring out who\u2019s in and who\u2019s not.  \n\n  5. **Built-in subsidy processing:** Manually reimbursing employees for individual gym members is exceptionally time-consuming. And, it\u2019s a headache that may deter some employees from participating in subsidized [fitness](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/how-wearable-technologies-will-drive-workplace-wellness-in-2019/). Using a platform that offers built-in processing of fee subsidies can take a lot of work and pressure off the HR and benefits management team. The company sets the requirements and rules, and the processer handles the task.\n\n  \n**Learn More:[The New Era of Corporate Wellness\nInitiatives](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/the-\nnew-era-of-corporate-wellness-initiatives/)**  \n  \nOffering great[ employee wellness\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/untapped-\npossibilities-of-corporate-wellness/) can deliver a measurable ROI for\ncompanies, but only if the management of those programs isn\u2019t so cumbersome,\ncostly, and time-consuming. Partnering with a technology provider to handle\nthe management and logistics of your wellness program can not only make it\neasier and cheaper but also incentivize and raise employee participation.\nBoosting program efficiency through the use of technology ensures your program\ndelivers a strong ROI that makes it worthwhile for both employees and the\ncompany.\n\n_**Do you have any wellness program in your company?

Services at Ascender_**\n\nOrganisations are constantly dealing with change. Especially across Asia,\nconducting business can be a little more complicated sometimes, due to the\nrichness of and variety in cultural and social norms, economic systems,\nbusiness practices and governmental focus areas. Unlike in Europe where\nstandardisation is the goal between countries, Asia Pacific will remain\ndiverse and different for the foreseeable future, but that makes doing\nbusiness here far more interesting!\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)\n\nInna Wahlberg is the General Manager of Asia Services at Ascender.  \n---  \n  \nThis year, we can expect to see a similar pace of regulatory and technical\nchange as we have grown accustomed to in previous years, but we also expect to\nsee a heightened focus on employee wellness and engagement as an emerging\ntrend in the region. The continuously evolving regulatory landscape will keep\ncompliance on the forefront businesses in this region as well.\n\nTo help organisations prepare for upcoming changes, we will shed some light on\nwhat to expect in 2020, and why.\n\n**Enforcing accurate, timely pay**\n\nEmployees care deeply about their pay. This is fundamental. Getting pay right\nhas still proven quite difficult for organisations to achieve. We also see an\nemerging interest in pay equity across the region. Employees are starting to\npay more attention to the notion of equal pay for equal work, and they are\nbecoming more open to talking about this in the workplace.\n\nTo accomplish pay transparency, HR and payroll managers first need to\nestablish trust. In a \u2018gig economy\u2019 with a more contingent workforce\nconsisting increasingly of part-time or freelance team members, each\ncompensation package is unique, which means clear communication about the set-\nup of the total compensation package is critical.\n\nGiven the transformation in the way we work, legislators will also watch this\nspace closely, applying more scrutiny and stricter legislation to affected\nindustries in an effort to protect the workforce from adverse effects, such as\nwage theft. While more precise practices can add complexity to payroll,\ncompliance will ultimately help build employee confidence and enhance the\norganisation's reputation.\n\n**The importance of employee wellness**\n\nEmployee Health and Safety has been a key focus area in many organisations for\na number of years. However, in 2020, we are seeing a subtle but important\nshift towards focus on Employee Wellness. Wellness as a trend encompasses both\nphysical but also mental wellbeing and employees are starting to think more\nholistically about what this means for their workforce.\n\nWe now experience a growing emphasis on agile working across Asia. According\nto results from Randstad Workmonitor, 87% of Singaporeans said that having the\nautonomy to work at an offsite location increases their productivity,\ncreativity, and job satisfaction. Similar trends can be seen in other Asian\ncountries too. This puts more pressure on employers to provide better\nfacilities in support of such ways of working, and focus on personal health\nand flexible work arrangements. We also see many companies are already\nembracing the trend by incorporating more meaningful perks and employee\nbenefits to their portfolio.\n\nLast year, Microsoft in Japan implemented a four-day work week initiative,\nwhich, according to the company, led to a 40% boost in productivity. With\nglobal organisations leading the way with such policies, these discussions are\npoised to have a broader impact for businesses.\n\n**Impact of legislation**\n\nIn 2020 we expect the volume of statutory and legislative changes across Asia\nto continue to gradually increase, as the drive for increasing transparency\nfor employees with regards to payroll and HR policies grows, which in turn\nwill add complexity to businesses operating in the region. Additionally,\ndiverse local statutes are supplemented by additional cross-border regulation\nsuch as most notably the EU\u2019s GDPR, which will have an impact on how companies\noperate in the region.\n\nA sampling of key legislative changes that have already taken effect include\nSingapore, where the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions for workers\nover 55 years of age will steadily increase each year to a new maximum level\nin 2030. In China, the government recently completed a significant overhaul of\nthe income tax system introducing more complexity in payroll management\nlocally. In Malaysia, when the Minimum Wages Order 2020 comes into effect, two\ndifferent sets of minimum wage rates will start to apply.\n\nWe expect similar changes to continue to occur in 2020 and beyond.\n\n**What does this mean for organisations in APAC in 2020?**\n\nIn 2020, organisations operating in APAC must increasingly start to shift\ntheir attention from merely managing the complex and continuously evolving\nregulatory landscape into topics like employee wellbeing and engagement.\nEngaged employees are likely to be much more productive and loyal. This is\nimportant because there is a clear linkage between a happy team and improved\nclient satisfaction. Happy employees provide great service, and that in turn\nboosts the company's bottom line.\n\nRegardless of where your business is based, it is imperative to remain\ncompliant both from legal, social, and individual perspectives. Those who can\nadapt quickly will thrive in this market over time.\n\n|  \n\n* * *\n\n  | [![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)  \n---|---|---  \n|\n\n**Ascender** is a Premium Sponsor of the upcoming  \n[HR Tech Festival Asia\n2020](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post)\n(29 \u2013 30 September, Singapore),  \nthe region\u2019s largest HR technology conference and exhibition.  \nLearn more about their solutions at the event.\n\n| [**Register to attend the event today!\n__**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/registration?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post%20Register)  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png) |  |  \n|  |  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  \n|  |  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=2020+Payroll+and+HR+Trends+in+Asia&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

The leak went viral and sent benefits counsel and other retirement\nplan providers into a tizzy. Well it seems that the whistleblower may have\ngotten it wrong._\n\nOn February 25, a story hit the Internet that an anonymous IRS whistleblower\nreported that the IRS had informed its agents that in order to clear the\nbacklog of VCP submissions, agents were instructed to enforce deadlines and\nautomatically refer submissions for examination (e.g., IRS audit) if other VCP\nrequirements were not timely met. For example, if an IRS deadline to provide\nadditional information was not met or if the plan sponsor and IRS could not\nagree on an acceptable correction method, the plan would automatically be\nreferred for IRS examination.\n\nThis put all of us into a real dither. The VCP was established almost 30 years\nago and was a welcome relief to plan sponsors who discovered operational or\nplan document mistakes. Before the VCP was established, a plan sponsor faced\nthe difficult choice to either sweep the mistake under the rug and hope for\nthe best, or to apply to the IRS for a \"closing agreement.\" Given that\nobtaining a closing agreement was no certainty, might be costly and corrective\nmeasures and sanctions were very much uncertain, it should be no surprise the\napproach many sponsors took \u2013 sweep, bury, hope and pray.\n\nSo when the IRS established what eventually evolved into the VCP, good-\nintentioned plan sponsors now had a way to bring plan mistakes out into the\nlight of day and fashion a correction without all the uncertainty of seeking a\nclosing agreement. This is why everyone reacted strongly to the news that\nagents were encouraged to refer submissions for examination when a\ndisagreement arose or delays ensued. Threatening plan sponsors with referral\nfor an IRS audit seemed a bit of a \"throwing the baby out with the dirty\nbathwater\" approach to the problem.\n\nIt looks like the whistleblower's interpretation of the directive may have\nbeen misguided. At the recent Tax-Exempt Entity/Governmental Entity (TE/GE)\nNational Meeting in Washington DC, a senior TE/GE official clarified that the\nVCP was not being changed, and that agents were only reminded that they\nalready had discretion to seek examination of an underlying plan if inquiries\nand requests for additional information were ignored or if the negotiation of\nan appropriate correction became deadlocked. The senior TE/GE official also\nstated that the cooperative attitude of the IRS was not changing, although it\nis hard to know how this might play out if, for example, the IRS makes a\nrequest than cannot be answered timely.\n\nSo it seems the IRS does not want the VCP to go the way of the do-do bird, and\nis painting the whistleblower as misinterpreting the internal discussions. Or\nperhaps it was just a hoax intentionally perpetrated to distract from the real\nnews in the employee benefits world \u2013 the SECURE Act will require plans and\nplan sponsors to consider the numerous changes required or available to their\nretirement benefit plans? We doubt that Congress will open an investigation to\nfind the truth, so we'll all be left to wonder!

This\ncould be based on age, parental status or location \u2013 among other factors \u2013 to\naccount for the differing needs of each employee. For smaller companies with\nsmaller budgets, this may mean allowing staff to pick and choose from a\nlimited range of benefits. However, for larger companies this can mean having\nentirely different options on offer, and packages for their employees based on\nwhat stage they\u2019re at in life.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cv.jpg)\n\nIf you\u2019re an employer and you\u2019ve not previously heard of personalised flexible\nbenefits, or have never felt it worth implementing them, this could be the\ntime to rethink that decision for one simple reason: over 90% of your\nemployees want them. If you don\u2019t, then you may find yourself joining the\never-growing ranks of CEOs wondering why their staff turnover is so high.\n\n  \n**So, why offer personalised flexible benefits?**\n\nThe reason your employees want personalised flexible benefits is that they are\nindividuals who need to feel valued in the workplace. This is easily addressed\n- offer them choice and treat them as an individual with unique needs.  \n  \nThis is especially true given that you are more likely than ever to be\nemploying five different generations at once, including Gen-Z and the\nmillennial generation. These generations in particular grew up with\ncustomisation available on tap \u2013 from coffee to technology. As a result, they\nexpect employees to offer customisation of their benefits.\n\nSo what are the top five personalised flexible benefits that employees want?\n\n**Flexible/remote working**\n\n  \nNot every employee can physically get to their workplace every day, whether\nthat\u2019s due to disability, injury or caring responsibilities for children or\nelderly relatives. By offering flexible or remote working to your employees,\nyou can retain their services when otherwise they may have been forced to\nleave the workforce.\n\nFlexible working\n\nFlexible hours allow employees with responsibilities or a busy social life to\ncome and go when they need to, and then catch up on lost hours when they have\nthe free time, for instance after their children are in bed. Of particular\nnote is the fact that in a 2017 MetLife report, 75% of respondents were\ninterested in flexible working. As such, it\u2019s highly likely that  your\nemployees are interested in flexible working, even if they haven\u2019t told you so\nyet!\n\n**Remote working**\n\nNot every employee functions best in a crowded or noisy office. Making remote\nworking an option recognises this fact. While not necessarily viable every day\ndue to the risk of loneliness, simply having the option can boost employee\nproductivity. Importantly, this boost to employee productivity is tangible,\nwith one Stamford University study showing up to a 30% improvement in\nproductivity as a result of the option being available.\n\nWorking from home can also be vital for carers or those with long commutes,\nand can even allow you to retain those who need to relocate. Offering the\nchance to work from home can make all the difference when you are trying to\nreduce staff turnover.\n\n**Pensions top-up**\n\n  \nEven among younger workers, there\u2019s serious anxiety about retirement age \u2013\nmost of those entering employment today expect their career to last until at\nleast their 70th birthday. This anxiety is backed up by government statistics:\na Department for Work and Pensions report shows more than 1 in 10 individuals\npast retirement age to be still employed. This has also translated into an\n11.8% increase among the workforce who are saving for retirement according to\na report by Scottish Widows. Given that your employees believe their normal\npension alone cannot support them for the full duration of their lifespans, a\npension top-up is likely to be a very appealing prospect.\n\n**Extra holiday**\n\nIn 2019, the New Economics Foundation \u2013 a UK based think tank \u2013 released a\nreport that recommended the best way to increase productivity is to increase\npay and the available holiday of employees. Given that the UK has one of the\nworst rates of productivity among international advanced nations, increased\nproductivity is certainly desirable.  \n  \nIt is also widely acknowledged that by increasing the amount of leave\navailable to your employees, they feel more relaxed at work, safe in the\nknowledge that if they require time off they can take a few days out. As such,\nit should come as no surprise that staff greatly appreciate the option of\ntaking additional holiday as part of their benefits package.\n\n**Gym memberships and cycle to work schemes**\n\nWhile a somewhat traditional option, access to gym memberships or cycle to\nwork schemes as part of a benefits programme is something that many employees\nstill really appreciate. They feel like you, as their employer, genuinely care\nabout their health and wellbeing. Helpfully, the government agrees that\ncycling to work is a good idea, and offers you tax exemptions on the creation\nof cycle to work schemes. While the government does not provide tax incentives\nfor gym membership, they do strongly recommend offering exercise-related\nbenefits to employees, citing cuts in sick days, and boosted productivity.\n\n**Education opportunities**\n\nOne surprisingly effective way to help your employees feel more valued is to\noffer them learning and development opportunities. This has the benefit of\nhelping the employee feel like you are choosing to invest in them as an\nindividual, allowing them to feel more secure, while also providing you with a\nmore productive business asset in the long-term. Importantly, this training\ncan also provide long-term benefits as these motivated employees often suggest\nimprovements to streamline processes and systems based on their new knowledge.\n\n  \nThere is, however, an important additional side to this desire for training.\nResearch by Totaljobs has shown that 2 in every 3 UK workers has quit a job\ndue to lack of development, so offering training and room for personal growth\nis clearly of vital importance to your employees. As an employer, offering\nfree or subsidised education opportunities seems like an elegant solution to\nyour problem.  With the potential to gain a better-trained employee, who feels\nhappier and more productive, what possible reason could you have to say no?\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-personalised-flexible-\nbenefits%2F&linkname=The%20importance%20of%20personalised%20flexible%20benefits\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-personalised-flexible-\nbenefits%2F&linkname=The%20importance%20of%20personalised%20flexible%20benefits\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-personalised-flexible-\nbenefits%2F&linkname=The%20importance%20of%20personalised%20flexible%20benefits\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-personalised-flexible-\nbenefits%2F&linkname=The%20importance%20of%20personalised%20flexible%20benefits\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-personalised-flexible-\nbenefits%2F&linkname=The%20importance%20of%20personalised%20flexible%20benefits\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-importance-of-personalised-flexible-benefits/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-importance-of-personalised-flexible-benefits/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cv-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=The importance of personalised flexible benefits)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-importance-of-personalised-flexible-benefits/&text=The importance of personalised flexible benefits)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

One of the main ways\nto ensure this is by encouraging all faculty, staff, and student workers to\nstay home if they are sick. Additionally, we are focused on keeping pay and\nbenefits whole for our employees who may find their work disrupted by\nCOVID-19.\n\n##\n\n## Paid Leave\n\n### Emergency Paid Leave\n\nThe [University Emergency Paid Leave for\nCOVID-19](https://policy.umn.edu/operations/uemergency-appc), an appendix to\nthe Administrative Policy: [University State of Emergency: Human Resources\nImplications](https://policy.umn.edu/operations/uemergency), took effect on\nMarch 23, 2020. The goal of this interim benefit is to provide emergency paid\nleave for COVID-19 related reasons in order to maintain the health and\nwellbeing of our University community.\n\n**University Emergency Paid Leave**  \nEffective March 23, 2020, the University will provide emergency paid leave of\nup to a total of 80 hours to faculty, staff, and student workers. This leave\nis intended only for situations when employees are unable to work or work\nremotely due to COVID-19 related illness, the need to quarantine or isolate as\na result of exposure to COVID-19, to care for someone who is ill with\nCOVID-19, to care for a child whose school or childcare is closed or\nunavailable, or to assist with the relocation of a college-age child due to\nCOVID-19. If you work less than 100% time, paid leave hours will be\nproportionate to the percentage of time you work. For example, someone who\nworks 50% time will receive a total of 40 hours of University Emergency Paid\nLeave or a student who works an average of 15 hours per week would qualify for\nup to 30 hours of paid leave.\n\n**Using Emergency Paid Leave**  \nYou can use this leave beginning March 23, 2020 and this leave will be tracked\nby the unit's time and absence administrator. If you need to use this leave,\nemployees should request it in the same manner that they request and utilize\nother paid leaves. You will not need to provide medical documentation.\nHowever, if you are ill with COVID-19 for an extended period and you want to\nuse your employee-elected short-term disability insurance, you will need to\nprovide documentation to the University\u2019s provider, UNUM, regarding your\nillness. Your use of your short term disability coverage can run concurrently\nwith emergency paid leave.\n\nIf additional time away is needed beyond what is provided in the [University\nState of Emergency: Human Resources\nImplications](https://policy.umn.edu/operations/uemergency), you can use\nregular available sick leave or paid medical leave plus comp time, if\neligible.\n\n**Change to Leave Use for March 16\u201322, 2020**  \nEmergency-leave eligible employees will be paid for their regularly scheduled\nhours between March 16 and 22, 2020, with the exception of pre-approved\nvacation, personal holiday, or leave of absence without pay. This means those\nwho were sick or used sick time to quarantine, isolate, or care for someone\nwho was ill, do not need to enter an absence request or use paid leave and\nwill be paid their regular wages. Employees will not need to accrue a negative\nsick balance during this period. This approach is different from what I shared\nin my email on March 12. Given the tremendous changes happening across the\nUniversity at that time, this approach is simpler and more consistent over\ntime.\n\nBeginning March 23, 2020, any leaves not qualifying for emergency paid leave\nwill be processed using the guidelines provided in the Administrative Policy:\n[Campus and Building\nClosure](https://policy.umn.edu/operations/emergencyclosing) in the appendix\n[Pay Provisions During Emergency Closings or Reduced\nOperations](https://policy.umn.edu/operations/emergencyclosing-appd).\n\nThe Office of Human Resources routinely updates our website regarding the\n[impact of COVID-19 on our workplace](https://humanresources.umn.edu/home/hr-\nand-covid) with [FAQs](https://humanresources.umn.edu/faq-covid) and\nresources. In the future, I will share updates on the Federal Emergency Paid\nSick Leave Act of 2020 when details become available.\n\n### Those Who Are Uncomfortable Being in the Workplace\n\nEssential employees who are healthy and must work on campus all or part of the\ntime and who are uncomfortable being in the workplace can use vacation time,\nunpaid time if their vacation balance is exhausted, or comp time (for Labor\nRepresented and Civil Service) to be absent from the workplace. Please follow\nthe current policy requiring supervisor approval for time away.\n\n_A chart that shows which types of leave can be used in specific circumstances\ndue to COVID-19 is being updated to reflect changes in policy and will be\navailable shortly._\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nBenefits, including the employee health plan, will continue for employees\nwhile on Emergency Paid Leave related to COVID-19. UPlan Medical Plan\nparticipants using Medica will have COVID-19 tests covered. If you are ill due\nto COVID-19 for an extended period and have [short term disability\ninsurance](https://humanresources.umn.edu/disability/short-term-disability-\ninsurance), contact UNUM.\n\n### Physical, Mental, and Financial Health Care from Home\n\nResources are available that you can use from home if you need some help.\nLearn about the [virtual services for physical health, mental, health,\nfinancial health, and wellbeing\nresources](https://humanresources.umn.edu/virtual-care-during-covid-19). These\nservices are available to employees, undergraduate and graduate students,\nfellows, residents, and interns.\n\nBack to top\n\n## COVID-19 in the Workplace\n\nIf you think you may have COVID-19, contact your primary health care provider.\nAs with any illness, stay home and report your absence using the standard\nprocess for your unit. Whether you are working from home or on campus, notify\nyour supervisor and human resources staff if you believe that you have\nCOVID-19 so your time away is tracked as Emergency Paid Leave related to\nCOVID.\n\nSupervisors, administrators, and HR staff members are obligated to respect the\nprivacy of University employees health conditions.

But despite the\ngrowing demand, the majority of companies are lagging behind in their benefit\nofferings.\n\nJust 18% offer in vitro fertilization support, and about 19% of employers\noffer fertility benefits other than IVF, according to data from the Society\nfor Human Resource Management. Those figures declined from 26% and 24%,\nrespectively, when compared to 2017. With the average cost of fertility\ntreatments between $11,000 and $12,000, providing financial assistance can\nfoster a culture of equality and fairness and lower health care costs, says\nTammy Sun, CEO of Carrott Fertility.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about the kind of workplace we want to create and what we stand\nfor, we want to work with employers who support employees who want to create\nequal access to how people are able to pursue parenthood,\u201d Sun says.\n\nCarrot Fertility is revamping their own benefits platform to ease the\nfinancial strain of paying for treatments with their latest program, Carrot\nCard. The debit card allows employees to use allocated funds to pay for\napproved services directly, so employees don\u2019t have to reach into their own\npockets.\n\nPreviously, employees would pay for their treatments \u2014 egg freezing, IVF,\nadoption donor and gestation services \u2014 and then be reimbursed through their\nemployer via the Carrot platform.\n\nSun shared her thoughts on why providing financial assistance with fertility\nbenefits is so crucial in a one-on-one interview.\n\n **Why should employers offer fertility benefits?**  \nOur most motivated employer is one that is hearing from their employees.\nEmployers and HR people in particular want to know how they can be of service.\nThey want to know what is the best allocation of healthcare spending in a way\nthat employees value and will have the highest impact. So the impact could be\nin that the ROI is measured through the reduction of medical costs related to\nunmanaged IVF. We also see that there is a high concentration of employees who\nuse Carrot that are still with the company months later.\n\nOne of the biggest value propositions of flexibility in a fertility benefit is\nthat opposite sex couples and LGBTQ+ people can have access to this kind of\nheathcare. There are a lot of aspects of LGBTQ+ healthcare that are excluded\nfrom the traditional healthcare system even outside of fertility.\n\nHR and benefits have been struggling to figure out how to deal with this issue\nof equal access to fertility care, and they haven\u2019t had asolution. There\u2019s a\nvery deep cultural aspect around equality and around fairness that comes up in\nthese conversations at a very human level.\n\n**What do you think caused the drop in coverage SHRM reported?**  \nThe decline could be attributed to the fact that the insurance solution can be\na little bit bumpy or that people who don\u2019t have an infertility diagnosis\ncan\u2019t access coverage.\n\nIncreasingly, benefits leaders really want global solutions and insurance\ncan\u2019t offer that. So the decline may be attributed to the fact that there is\njust less utilization or less value being extracted from existing insurance\nsolutions. We\u2019ve seen very healthy adoption among our client base and we\u2019re\nexcited by the growth we\u2019re seeing in both the fully insured employer group\nand the self funded employer group.\n\n**Why did you decide to launch Carrot card?**  \nWe really wanted to make it much more seamless to use Carrot. This is a new\nfeature on our payments platform that does two things. First, the Carrot\nprovider network is dynamically coded onto the card. That means the card can\nonly be used at a Carrot approved care provider. The technology also has the\nemployer\u2019s custom plan design on the card. So that could be $5,000 of flexible\nfertility spending, $10,000, $20,000 etc. This way, the employee swipes and\npays and it\u2019s as easy as that. The employer has more data and insight into how\nthe benefits are being tracked.\n\nBefore the Carrot card the only version of the product was through\nreimbursement and that means the employee pays for fertility care upfront.\nThey use the app and we provide all of the features around adjudication,\nsecurity and resiliency. Essentially the employee would be reimbursed through\nCarrot from the employer, but there are only some employees who can afford to\ndo that.\n\nWe thought it was important that members could have a better experience. The\nemployers could have more insights into the benefit and the ROI of the\nbenefit, but also more people who can't afford to do reimbursements are\ngetting access to fertility benefits.\n\n**Where is interest growing when it comes to offering fertility benefits?**  \nWe\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in media and professional sports. We\u2019re seeing\ncontinued interest from financial services consulting as well. It\u2019s pretty\ndiverse, as retail and manufacturing are coming online.\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to respond to employer demand by bringing more countries into\nour roadmap. We are a global benefit and work with nearly 40 countries around\nthe world. And we\u2019re going to continue to double down on member features to\nmake sure the member experience is as high quality as possible.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b4c165/2147483647/strip/true/crop/195x195+7+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcb%2Fb0%2F9f870dfd44e19e452df9fe002101%2Fsourcemedia.brightspotcdn-1.jpg)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/amanda-schiavo)\n\n[Amanda

In a recent field survey1 of healthcare Chief Experience\nOfficers (CXOs), about a third\n[indicated](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/whitepapers/2020-employee-care-report) they were responsible for\nOrganizational Culture, a quarter oversaw both Employee and Patient\nExperience, yet less than 12% had any sort of formal relationship with Human\nResources.\n\nCulture, Team Member Experience (TX) and Human Resources (HR) are imperative\nto a positive Patient Experience. In order to be effective, the CXO should\nhave a clearly formalized relationship with the CHRO.\n\n# Importance of Experience\n\n## Building the Foundation\n\nTeam member engagement is a foundational pillar, upon which rest several\norganizational objectives, irrespective of the industry and mission of the\norganization. It is even more relevant in industries such as healthcare, where\nan error can result in multiple deaths. The relevance gains momentum in times\nwhere healthcare is [experiencing high\nburnout](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-burnout-in-2020) with suicide rates double that\nof other industries, and a time where employers are competing for skills, the\nnumbers retiring exceed those entering the workforce and an industry turnover\nof about 20% 2. This significance grows exponentially when we place this\nagainst the backdrop of skyrocketing costs of healthcare in the US3, uncertain\nfederal funding programs and increasing competition from non-traditional\nplayers 4.\n\nTeam member engagement directly impacts Patient Experience (PX) and Safety\noutcomes. The top quartile of engaged healthcare teams exhibit 70% lower\nsafety incidents than those in the bottom quartile 5. A 5-point change in\nEngagement score impacts 1% profitability 6.\n\nIn my second week as the Chief Experience Officer (CXO) at Parkland, Judy\nHerrington, Vice President of Nursing made it very clear to me that the\n\"plate\" of the leader on the frontlines overflows with priorities marked\nurgent and more urgent, with new initiatives added daily, and few taken off.\nWe conduct various surveys, and each survey ends up producing another set of\n\"action items\". These action items are then pushed down from the C-Suite\nthrough the chain of command to the front-line leader. When the front-line\nleader attempts to implement, they can receive resistance from the team\nmembers as they are already busy. This results in two phenomenon: the burnout\nof the front line leader who is under pressure from above and below, and\ndisengagement of the frontline team. The engine of senior leadership driving\nfor results is pushing the train of the many hierarchical leaders down the\ntrack, where the last coach, the front-line team member, is against the blocks\nat the end of the track. Further pushing from leaders only leads to the train\nbuckling - more misalignment, turnover, cost over runs and safety issues.\n\nWhile it seems logical that Team member Experience and Patient Experience\nshould be aligned, yet, in the survey of CXOs in the US Healthcare Industry1,\nonly 24% of the CXOs indicated ownership of Team member Experience.\nInterestingly, another 28% suggested they would be more effective in their\nrole if Team member Experience was included in their scope. Furthermore, 36%\nof the CXOs indicated they were responsible for Organizational Culture while\nan additional 28% suggested they would be more effective if this was included\nin their scope.\n\nTX and PX initiatives can be, or in fact, _should_ be actioned together.\nSafety & Quality initiatives need to be clinician led to ensure buy in and\nsustainability, while being closely coordinated with TX & PX. Various\npermutations of this model are being used in various healthcare systems and\nare organization and leader dependent. While that is the case, 8% of the CXOs\nsurveyed were responsible for Safety & Quality, half of whom were actively\nattempting to divest themselves of that function.\n\nAligning TX and PX is also logical from a Financial perspective - for\nreimbursement and for customer retention and acquisition.\n\nExamining the [financial logic](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-experience-the-business-case) from a\nreimbursement perspective: TX impacts Communication of Nurses which is a key\ndriver for \"Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems\"\n(HCHAPs) scores. TX also impacts safety outcomes. HCAHPs, and safety outcomes\nare utilized in the Value Based Purchasing (VBP) model to calculate\nreimbursement for Medicare services provided by the organization. For the sake\nof simplicity, I am only demonstrating HCAHPs in the diagram below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_1.jpg)\n\nCustomer retention and acquisition are also impacted by TX. From a marketing\nperspective, TX impacts the experience of the Patient and their family, and\nthis impacts the customer churn. Positive team member experiences will\ndecrease the Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA) and the Cost of Customer\nRetention (COCR) substantially, thus making the financial case again for\naligning TX and PX.\n\nVolunteer Services also play a major role by not only providing some man hours\nat no cost, but more importantly, by engaging the community. They are an\ninformal and more effective means of communicating the image, mission, vision\nand values of the organization into the community from first hand experiences.\nThis is heightened in the age of social media and impacts COCA and COCR.\nActive volunteers are crucial for effective Patient Family Advisory Councils\n(PFACs) and provide valuable insights from a Voice of the Consumer (VOC)\nperspective. They are also excellent ambassadors to patients and their\nfamilies, in allaying any fears as a true third party that may have\nexperienced or seen a positive outcome of a similar procedure at the\norganization. While 28% of the CXOs surveyed managed volunteer services,\nanother 20% were working on bringing them into the experience fold to maximize\nsuch opportunities.\n\nThe dynamics of the factors impacting Team member & Patient Experience that\nare influenced by HR and Culture of the Organization are examined in the\ncontext of the data from Parkland (inclusive of both Parkland staff and UT\nSouthwestern providers primarily assigned to Parkland). The top factors were:\n\n  * Teamwork, Recognition, Leadership cares about \"me\", and factors impacting burnout (time to do my job (staffing), meaningful feedback, compensation, recognition, influence over decisions) \n\nThe interplay of these variables, when layered on top of the financial model\ndiscussed earlier, can be represented in the diagram as below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_2.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe system dynamics model above depicts that the primary drivers for HCAHPS\nare Team member Engagement, Communication with Nursing and Trust in Provider.\nIf we examine Patient's Trust in Provider (PTP), it is dependent upon Time\nspent with provider (staffing) and provider Burnout, both of which lead us\nback to other variables leading to HR and Culture. Other variables are mapped\nin a similar manner. Note the number of variables that are in the purview of\nthe HR team.\n\nWhile other support initiatives are required, such as those in the realm of\nProcess Improvement and Technology, to affect a meaningful change in TX & PX\nmetrics; HR is the key.\n\n> REPORT:  [The Interesction of Employee Engagement and Business\n> Success](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/reports/the-\n> intersection-of-employee-engagement-and-business-success)\n\nWhen we set up the CXO role at Parkland, our CEO, Dr. Fred Cerise and our then\nChief Talent Officer,\n\nDr. Jim Dunn saw in their wisdom the logic of placing both Team member and\nPatient Experience under the CXO. It is important to note that while we have\nhad leadership changes at Parkland, this structure has not changed and is now\nbeing reinforced even further by our current CTO, Felicia Miller. Leveraging\nthis strategy continuously over the past three years has helped achieve the\nfollowing metrics:\n\n  * HCAHPS scores for the Quarter ending December 2019 saw us in the 90th percentile for the National Database and in the 93rd percentile for University Health Systems Consortium. (Moving from the 79th and 75th percentiles respectively since Sep 2017).\n  * We achieved our Annual HCAHPS 2019 target of 89.3, a statistically significant improvement.\n  * Mean Employee Engagement score rose by 17 percentile ranks; nearly 6% over three years.\n  * Number of Tier 1 leaders rose from 32 to 122 over three years.\n  * Turnover decreased from 18.5% to 15.1% in 2018, representing savings of $9 million and is annualized at 14.8 % for 2019.\n  * Employee engagement survey participation grew from a flat 59% in 2014 and 2016 to 79% in 2017 and 88% in 2018. \n\nThe theory of combining TX and PX, its practical application at Parkland and\nresultant outcomes - all point to the benefits of having TX & PX under one\nleader, the Chief Experience Officer.\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n  1. \"CXO Structure Survey\", Vishal Bhalla, February 2020.

Emond](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=148145) and Ellyn Maese\n\n![COVID-19 Strategies and Policies of the World's Largest\nCompanies](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/rfpjezg9o0kd1bqawrhuca.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * New teams are critical for developing policies and providing information\n  * Learn COVID-19 protocols and business contingency plans\n  * Monitor impact and conduct assessments to sustain business function\n\n> _Gallup Managing Director Larry Emond_ _gathered the strategies and policies\n> of 100_ _members of the CHRO Roundtable, an organization that includes the\n> CHROs of more than 650 of the world 's largest companies, for their\n> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in this sampling average\n> $27 billion in revenue with 80,000 employees and most are global\n> organizations. This is what Emond found._\n\n### **Crisis Management Teams**\n\nMost organizations have created crisis management teams, task forces or\ncommittees with a response tailored to specific geographic regions. These task\nforces meet regularly to develop policies and provide information to leaders,\nmanagers and front-line employees regarding COVID-19 awareness, prevention,\nmanagement and hygiene practices.\n\nThese teams are also focused on management protocols and business continuity\nplans to guide current actions and forecast possible responses to future\nevents. In general, their protocols and plans include:\n\n  * developing succession contingencies for all major executives\n  * conducting business using virtual, video or audio capabilities\n  * restricting travel\n  * reducing to business-critical operations only\n  * moving critical operations to unaffected regions\n  * cross-training team members to perform critical functions in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of another team member\n  * documenting business-critical functions, processes or procedures in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of a team member\n  * distributing call center scripts and agent communications\n\nIf an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, many companies have established\nprotocols like these:\n\n  * Require employees to report confirmed cases -- either of self or family member -- of COVID-19 to HR or management. The affected are typically required to stay home for 14 days and/or until cleared by a doctor to return to work with confirmation that there is no diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  * Isolate employees diagnosed at work; immediately disinfect objects they've touched; trace their contact with other employees, customers, and clients; and notify those who may have been exposed without releasing the diagnosed employee's name.\n  * Ask employees to log all contact with other employees or visitors in case they become symptomatic so that others can be informed of potential exposure.\n\n### **Travel Requirements**\n\nMost companies have recommended limiting personal and professional travel, and\nsome have assured workers they could decline professional invitations without\npenalty. Generally called soft bans, these partial travel restrictions have\nbeen issued with requests to inform HR of travel and avoid air travel, public\ntransportation and large gatherings, as well as 14-day self-quarantines\nfollowing travel to affected areas.\n\nHowever, hard bans are in effect in many companies, and travel to China,\nItaly, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan has been prohibited.\nIndeed, most intercontinental travel -- and, more recently, even travel in\ngeneral -- has stopped for the time being, unless it's mission-critical.\n\n### **Business Impact**\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions. Many companies with facilities in\naffected areas have closed them and are canceling their own -- or their\nemployees' presence at -- conferences, events and face-to-face meetings. Some\nhave been able to move operations to unaffected locations.\n\nSimultaneously, CHROs are:\n\n  * monitoring supply chains or providers for potential impacts\n  * conducting ongoing supply chain risk assessment and operation impact assessment\n  * considering alternative suppliers\n  * preparing for shortages, transportation delays or communication delays\n  * approving additional budget for supplies or additional paid time off\n  * reducing or suspending bonuses for top earners\n  * analyzing and forecasting potential market impacts\n\n### **Wellbeing**\n\nCompanies are also assessing risks to their [employees' physical and financial\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-\nwellbeing-high.aspx). Their mitigation efforts include:\n\n  * instituting mandatory work-from-home or [remote work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288956/covid-teams-working-remotely-guide-leaders.aspx) policies where possible\n  * closing on-site facilities such as gyms, cafeterias and common areas\n  * making revisions to employee compensation and benefits policies\n  * granting paid time off for symptomatic employees, employees who must care for family members who are diagnosed with COVID-19, and/or employees with diagnosed cases of COVID-19\n  * using standing sick leave, extended sick leave, vacation time, paid time off or flex-time policies\n  * increasing sick leave or paid time off for all or on a case-by-case basis\n  * utilizing short-term disability, family leave (FMLA) or other existing benefits\n  * recommending available Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n  * reminding employees about mental health services for [stress management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257501/charge-work-stress-starting-managers.aspx)\n  * using back-up care programs, childcare subsidies or other dependent care benefits\n  * refraining from penalizing time off of any kind\n  * permitting unlimited unpaid time off without penalty\n  * providing travel/international SOS (medical and travel security) services\n  * paying for time spent under quarantine\n  * [offering work-from-home options](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/263510/manage-remote-employees.aspx) or adjusting schedules due to school closures\n  * communicating employer-sponsored insurance and other relevant benefits\n  * advising employees to avoid public transportation\n  * staggering shifts to help employees avoid busy commutes\n  * advising employees to avoid visiting high-traffic events or locations on personal time\n  * reconfiguring meeting rooms, break rooms and other common areas to promote social distancing\n  * expanding the time of meal service to avoid congestion, and asking employees to consider alternate meal times to reduce crowds\n\n### **Technology**\n\nThese companies are testing technological (e.g., remote work) capabilities,\nemergency notification systems and updating employee contact information.\nThey're advising employees to take their laptops or other portable equipment\nhome each night, and they are devoting IT staff to help employees set up\nremote connections at home, sometimes on employees' personal computers.\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions.\n\nMany companies have required or are encouraging video or audio-conferencing\nmeetings (e.g., Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) or phone calls in lieu of face-\nto-face meetings. They also recommend conducting collaborative projects by\nvideo or audio-conferencing, Google Docs, emails or other online channels.\n\n### **Communications**\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols. Many are issuing FAQ guides, and many are including\nlinks to authorities and external organizations such as the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), The World Health Organization (WHO),\nJohns Hopkins University, local governments and outbreak maps.\n\nAlong with expert advice, these messages often include a genuinely personal\nelement, i.e., reminding workers to get information from credible\norganizations, assuring them that none of their fellow employees have tested\npositive for the virus (where applicable) and urging employees not to panic or\nspread rumors. They will also often encourage employees to obtain enough food,\nwater, medicines and other essentials for their families in case of quarantine\nor scarcity.\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols.\n\nCommunications are usually tailored to the recipients -- whether leaders,\nmanagers, employees or clients/customers, respectively -- and methods include:\n\n  * social media for public messages\n  * email, mail, text messages, hotlines and internal systems (i.e., intranet) to propagate pertinent information\n  * signage to reinforce hygiene, screening and other organizational policies\n\nMembers of the CHRO Roundtable are conscious of the effects of their\ncommunication, particularly on customers. To that end, many have:\n\n  * Proscribed responses from managers/leaders if contacted by the media. Many have designated media relations personnel who address all questions from the media.\n  * Asked employees not to violate the privacy of diagnosed employees or clients/customers in social media messages.\n  * Deployed social media and marketing messaging about customer policies and alternative commerce/services.\n\n### **Training**\n\nBusinesses are rapidly expanding training opportunities. Much of it concerns\nmanagers, who are being tasked with assisting in coronavirus containment,\nresponding to employee needs or concerns, and communicating disease-management\npolicies and preventative measures, such as hygiene practices. But CHROs are\nalso creating COVID-19-specific training programs for security professionals,\ncleaning crews, maintenance and groundskeeping staff.\n\nThese protocols and responses, we're told, will be operational as long as is\nneeded -- the end of May is the current long-term projection -- and all are\nsubject to revision. Gallup will continue to report on our findings as the\nsituation evolves.\n\n### **Discover these crucial resources to better prepare your company during\nthis disruption:**\n\n  * [Watch our live webinar \"COVID-19: Managing Your Workforce Through Disruption\"](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2227447/9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B?parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy) to get everything Gallup knows about disruption and other crises.\n  * Read about how to [manage the loneliness and isolation of remote workers in this article](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268076/manage-loneliness-isolation-remote-workers.aspx).\n  * Read about \"The Changing Place and Space of Work\" in Gallup's [_State of the American Workplace report_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx), which includes research on remote work trends and best practices.\n\nLarry Emond is Managing Director of Global Leadership Advisory at Gallup.\n\nEllyn Maese is a Research Associate at Gallup.\n\n_Jennifer Robison contributed to this article._\n\n[\n![](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/SPEEDBUMPS/jfrv8v85vegptqw9if7wcw.png)\nDeep Dive  What Is Employee Engagement, Really?

This outside\nthe box experience rewards employees for their hard work with a relaxing but\n[productive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\nfight-the-productivity-epidemic/) retreat. Getting out of the office as a team\ncan inspire creativity, build stronger bonds, and provide direction for the\nremainder of the quarter.\n\n[Planning a successful retreat](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-\ncompany-retreat) isn\u2019t rocket science, but it does take some critical thinking\nand pre-booking to get the most out of the event. Follow the seven steps below\nfor an essential roadmap to planning the best retreat for your company.\n\n## **1\\. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nIt will be challenging to get buy-in from upper management without defining\nwhat constitutes a successful retreat. Bonus points if you can tie the results\ndirectly to revenue.\n\n  * **Morale Boost:** measure the turnover rate before and after the event, or even employee satisfaction with an anonymous survey.\n  * **Team Building:** breakdown barriers between departments, and have each explain their job in their own words to create inter-department bonds.\n  * **Marketing Materials:** take professional photos throughout the event to host on your social media pages or website for prospective employees to understand the [company culture.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/how-to-create-a-culture-of-growth-career-development-within-your-firm/)\n\n##  \n**2\\. Schedule the Event**\n\nConsider employee schedules. If your company is an accounting firm, April and\nmonths leading up to it would be a detrimental time to schedule the retreat.\nUse the event as an annual celebration to complement the employee work ethic\nafter the conclusion of a significant busy season.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Ways Employee Engagement Can Solve Productivity\nProblem](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/4-ways-\nemployee-engagement-can-solve-productivity-problem/)**\n\n## **3\\. Confirm Attendance**\n\nThe most successful retreats are the ones where there\u2019s buy-in from\nleadership. Confirm C-level executives will be in attendance to eliminate\nhierarchy during the event. Go one step further and have leaders come up with\nice breaker exercises or themed days throughout the retreat.\n\n## **4\\. Book the Location & Transportation**\n\nLocation, location, location. Think about the proximity of the office to the\nlocation of the event. If there will be any alcohol served, make sure\ntransportation is booked to and from the event. Some modes of transportation\nto consider include:\n\n  * **Taxis**\n  * **Busses**\n  * **Limos**\n  * **Airplanes**\n\n##  \n**5\\. Negotiate Pricing**\n\nBecause you\u2019re looking for such a large group, confirm any group discounts\nbefore charging the [company card](https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-\ncards/paypal-business-credit-card). Frequently, because you\u2019re bringing the\ntransportation company and the event space so much business, there are\ndiscounts to be had.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **6\\. Plan Events**\n\nDon\u2019t forget to plan the actual events during the retreat! These can be simple\nicebreakers or formal networking events. Think about your KPIs during this\nstage, as different activities will have more effects on the overall goal than\nothers.\n\n## **7\\. Revisit the Original KPIs**\n\nAfter the retreat is over and done with, revisit the goals set before going on\nthe resort. This is an excellent chance to elicit feedback. Understanding what\nwent well and didn\u2019t will be crucial to planning better and better retreats\nwith each passing year.\n\nWhen pitching this event to upper management, focus on the KPIs, especially\nanything that will affect the bottom line. Be an advocate for the employees\nwhile explaining the value that an event like this can have on overall morale.\n\n[![How to Plan a Company Retreat Without Losing Your Sanity](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-company-retreat)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=7 Ways to Create a Company Retreat with\nValue&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

The CDC estimated there were as many as 60.8 million cases of H1N1 in\nthe U.S. during the 2009-2010 timeframe. Of those cases, over 250,000 needed\nto be hospitalized, and approximately 12,500 deaths were attributed to H1N1.\nChildren and young adults were at greatest risk during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.\nMany may remember schools, day care centers, summer camps, and universities\nclosed down to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu. During that time, the federal\ngovernment\u2019s many agencies developed pandemic plans and policies, as did\nbusinesses. With what is happening now in the U.S., the time has come for\nbusinesses to update those policies for what appears to be a possible Covid-19\npandemic.\n\nThe Covid-19 virus is highly infectious, but its symptoms tend to be mild in\nmost (80 percent) of people. It does not present as a runny nose or nasal\ncongestion. Rather, 90 percent of patients have a fever and 70 percent have a\ndry cough. Those who are acutely ill usually experience shortness of breath.\nFor people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or\ncompromised immune systems, Covid-19 is causing severe illness and, for some,\ndeath. As a result, this possible pandemic is impacting the elderly more than\nchildren and anyone already suffering from a chronic illness. In fact, the\nWorld Health Organization reported that few children contracted the disease in\nChina and none of those died. For comprehensive information on the coronavirus\ngo to: [www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov/).\n\n### **Summary of CDC Recommendations for Employers**\n\nRemember, as you review these CDC\u2019s recommendations, it does not relieve an\nemployer of obligations they may have under the American With Disabilities Act\n(ADA), the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA), the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), or other applicable federal\nor state laws, some of which are discussed below in the context of pandemic\nplanning. It is also important to remember public health orders can trump all\nother relevant laws, especially when they impose a quarantine.\n\n(See:\n[www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html](http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html))\n\n1\\. Actively encourage employees with respiratory illness and fever to stay\nhome until they are free of a fever for at least 24 hours. You may still\nrequire they notify their supervisor daily.\n\n2\\. Ensure that your sick leave policies are modified to be flexible enough\nthey are consistent with any public health guidance and employees are aware of\nthese modified policies.\n\n3\\. Talk with companies that provide your business with contract or temporary\nemployees about the importance of their sick employees staying home and\nencourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies consistent with CDC\nguidelines.\n\n4\\. Consider whether you really need to require a health care provider\u2019s note\nfor employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their\nillness, as health care provider offices and medical facilities may be\nextremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.\n_(One useful approach during a pandemic may be to only require notes of those\nwho have a record of excessive absences._.\n\n5\\. Employers should have flexible policies permitting employees to stay home\nto care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware more employees may\nneed to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members\nthan usual.\n\n6\\. Be prepared to separate sick employees. The CDC recommends employees who\nappear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e., cough, shortness of\nbreath) upon arrival to work, or become sick during the day, should be\nseparated from other employees and sent home immediately. Sick employees\nshould be told to cover their noses and mouths with a tissue when coughing or\nsneezing (or an elbow or shoulder if no tissue is available).\n\n7\\. Place posters in the workplace that: a) encourage staying at home when\nsick; b) explain the proper etiquette for coughing & sneezing; c) explain hand\nhygiene when entering the work place or other working areas; c) explain how to\nwash hands; d) how to use anti-bacterial gels; and e) explain employees should\nuse soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n\n8\\. Provide tissues & no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees.\nProvide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60-95 percent alcohol. Ensure\nsupplies maintained in multiple locations or in conference rooms.\n\n9\\. Perform routine environmental cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces\n- workstations, countertops, doorknobs. No additional disinfection beyond\nroutine cleaning is recommended at this time.\n\n10\\. Provide disposable wipes so commonly used surfaces (for example,\ndoorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks) can be wiped down by employees\nbefore each use.\n\n11\\. For employees who are travelling, check the [CDC\u2019s Traveler\u2019s Health\nNotices](https://www.cdc.gov/travel) for guidance on each country of travel.\nSpecific travel information for travelers going to & returning from China and\ninformation for aircrew, can be found on the [CDC\nwebsite](///C:/Users/klanning/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/5RTEA5T1/continent':%20'6255149',%20'country':%20'6252001',%20'state':%20'',%20'region':%20').\nAdvise employees to check themselves for symptoms of [acute respiratory\nillness](///C:/Users/klanning/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/5RTEA5T1/continent':%20'6255149',%20'country':%20'6252001',%20'state':%20'',%20'region':%20')\nbefore starting travel, notify their supervisor, and stay home if they are\nsick.\n\n12\\. Ensure employees who become sick while traveling or on temporary\nassignment understand they should notify their supervisor and promptly call a\nhealth care provider for advice if needed.\n\n13\\. Employees who are well but have a sick family member at home with\nCOVID-19 should notify their supervisor and refer to CDC guidance for [how to\nconduct a risk assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-\nassessment.html) of their potential exposure.\n\n14\\. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform\nfellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19, and maintain\nconfidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and\nHIPAA. Employees exposed to a co-worker with confirmed COVID-19 should refer\nto CDC guidance for [how to conduct a risk\nassessment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-\nassessment.html) of their potential exposure.\n\n15\\. Consider how best to decrease the spread of acute respiratory illness and\nlower the impact of COVID-19 in their workplace in the event of a more severe\noutbreak in the U.S. Identify & communicate objectives, which may include one\nor more of the following:\n\n  1. reducing transmission among staff _( i.e., via social distancing or working from home);_\n\n  2. protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications _(i.e,. permitting offering accommodations for higher risk individuals until pandemic situation has passed);_\n\n  3. maintaining minimum business operations; and\n\n  4. minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.\n\n16\\. Some key considerations when making decisions on appropriate responses\ninclude the following:\n\n(a) Disease severity in the community where the business is located;\n\n(b) Impact of disease on employees who are vulnerable & at higher risk for\nadverse health complications.;\n\n(c) Prepare for possible increased numbers of employee absences due to illness\n\nof employees and their family members or dismissals or closures of schools;\n\n(d) Monitor & respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to\ncontinue your essential business functions in case you experience higher than\nusual absenteeism;\n\ne) Cross-train personnel to perform essential functions so the workplace is\nable to operate even if key staff members are absent;\n\nf) Assess essential functions & reliance others place on your services or\nproducts. Be prepared to change your business practices, if needed, to\nmaintain critical operations (i.e., alternative suppliers, prioritize\ncustomers, or temporarily suspend some of your operations if needed);\n\ng) If you have more than one business location, provide local managers with\nauthority to take appropriate actions based on the conditions in their\nlocality; and\n\nh) Coordinate with state & local health officials.\n\n**C. Other Possible Suggestions Not Yet Recommended by the CDC** 1\\. If your\nemployees travel by car, consider outfitting them with supplies to protect\nthem while stopping to refuel.\n\n2\\. Encourage employees to practice the six foot rule -when in public spaces\nand they notice someone with symptoms, encourage them to keep a six-foot\ndistance to lessen their risk.\n\n3\\. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as more and more people became infected,\nthe CDC suggested screening employees when they arrived at work. Currently,\nthe CDC recommends this for employers in health care, death care, waste\nmanagement, sold waste, airline travel, border patrol, and international\ntravel businesses.\n\n4\\. Another recommendation of the CDC in 2009 was one that is available under\nthe ADA, which is making appropriate plans for changing the work duties, work\nspaces, or schedules for employees at higher risk for complications from\nCovid-19.\n\n5\\. As your business explores ways to increase social distancing at work,\nconsider the following tools: a) Cancel non-essential face-to-face meetings;\nb) Cancel non-essential business travel; c) Use conference calling; and d)\nOffer tele-work or flexible hour options.\n\n### **The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nFMLA covers employers with 50 employees or more within a 75 mile radius. To be\neligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for 12\nmonths (and at least 1,250 hours) Under FMLA, employers must provide employees\nwith up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a spouse, son/daughter, or parent\nwith a serious health condition or for the employee\u2019s own serious health\ncondition. Employers should anticipate that health care providers will likely\nview being quarantined as a result of Covid-19, or caring for someone\nseriously ill from the virus, as meeting the definition of a serious health\ncondition.\n\nEven if Covid-19 is at issue, the employer can still require employees to give\nthe employer notice as soon as practical, require the absent employee comply\nwith the employer\u2019s daily call-in procedures, and provide information to\nsupport that absence is due to a serious health condition, and the probable\nlength of absence. If your locality is particularly hard hit, employers may\nneed to consider relaxing some of FMLA\u2019s deadlines for the return of various\nmedical information if providers are simply overwhelmed.\n\nEmployers need to inform employees if leave will be FMLA protected and the\namount of leave to be counted against their FMLA leave time. If the employer\ndetermines a requested leave will not be covered by FMLA, they\u2019ll need to\ninform the employee of that as well. At option of either the employee or the\nemployer, FMLA allows substituting any accrued paid leave for unpaid leave. In\nfact, the employer can require an employee use accrued paid leave while also\ncounting the absence as FMLA leave.\n\n### **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**\n\nThe ADA generally applies if the employer has 15 or more employees. The ADA\nprotects a disabled person from discrimination in the workplace when he/she is\nqualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a\nreasonable accommodation. A disability is any physical or mental impairment\nthat substantially limits one or more of an individual\u2019s life activities.\nReasonable accommodations can include: Rearranging existing facilities or\nworkplaces; Job restructuring; part time, modified or flex time schedules;\nadjustment of policies; Reassignment to a vacant position; and/or A leave of\nabsence. However, an accommodation is not reasonable if it imposes an undue\nhardship on the employer.\n\nDetermining what is reasonable requires an informal interactive process. An\nemployer need not agree to a particular accommodation requested if it is\nunreasonable. Furthermore, if an employee refuses a reasonable accommodation\nand cannot perform the essential functions of job, he/she is no longer a\nqualified person under ADA.\n\nPersons with chronic health conditions (diabetes, cancer, coronary heart\ndisease, immune deficiency disorders, etc.) may, depending on individual\ncircumstances, qualify as disabled or be perceived to be disabled and there is\nlittle dispute they are at higher risk of complications with Covid-19. Thus,\nthe ADA will likely play an important role for employers during this potential\npandemic.\n\nThis begs the question: _If you are aware of an employee\u2019s chronic health\ncondition, may you lawfully inform others of an employee\u2019s health condition\nand their possible need for an accommodation?_ Once a person is hired, an\nemployer may inform supervisors and managers of necessary restrictions or\naccommodations. The law also allows an employer to inform first aid and safety\npersonnel when appropriate. However, the ADA says nothing about allowing the\nsharing of information with co-workers. Thus, if the employee seeks an\naccommodation, you would be able to discuss the issue with the employee and\nhis/her manager or supervisor to work out an accommodation that reduces risk.\n\n_What about taking the initiative, with the best of intentions, to ferret out\npersons with chronic illnesses ahead of time, so you can help them?_ While the\nADA allows pre-employment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to\nperform job related functions, it does not allow an employer to require\nresponses to medical inquiries for current employees unless it is job related\nand consistent with business necessity. There is some good news though, the\nADA does allow for some planning in situations like this. An employer can\nconduct voluntary medical histories, subject to confidentiality requirements.\nSpecifically, an employer can survey its workforce for personal information\nneeded for pandemic preparation but only if employer asks broad questions, not\nlimited to disability-related inquiries.\n\nAttachment A is an example of a sample ADA compliant survey acceptable in\n2009. Such a compliant survey could be prepared by a business for a possible\nCovid-19 pandemic. You can also consider whether it would be helpful to\nannounce in advance that absences for up to seven days will be excused for all\npersons who self-disclose in the survey.\n\nFinally, nothing in the ADA prohibits the employer from adopting non-invasive\ninfection control practices at work, such as: 1) Requiring regular hand\nwashing, as well as coughing and sneezing etiquette; 2) Tissue usage and\ndisposal etiquette; 3) Personal protective equipment (i.e., face mask, gloves,\ngown), although the employer may need to accommodate for allergies due to\nlatex and provide modified gowns for use with wheelchairs; and 3) Encourage or\nrequire tele-work.\n\nSeparated workspace and tele-work may also be considered reasonable\naccommodations for persons needing an accommodation during the pandemic. Note\nalso, employers must not discriminate against any protected class in\nrequiring, granting, or denying tele-work options.\n\n### **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**\n\nThe FLSA regulates hours and wages of employees engaged in interstate\ncommerce. It sets statutory minimum wages for all hours worked and requires\novertime pay for hours over 40 in a work week. Employing someone means \u201cto\nsuffer or permit to work,\u201d which becomes important in these situations.\nEmployees doing non-requested work, with the knowledge of employer, must be\npaid, and that includes \u201chomework\u201d performed with employer\u2019s knowledge, unless\nit is work done by an exempt employee.\n\nUnder FLSA, it is the employer\u2019s duty to stop an employee from doing work the\nemployer does not want done. FLSA also requires these policies to be\n\u201cpublished\u201d to employees with specific instructions on how long to work. FLSA\ndoes not require paid sick leave. As such, paid absences do not count as work\ntime under FLSA. However, on duty time spent waiting for work counts as work\ntime, and \u201ccomp time in lieu of overtime\u201d must be limited to the same pay\nperiod, which obviously restricts the future use of comp time. All of this\nrequires very careful recordkeeping. Employees are not allowed to waive their\nright to overtime or minimum wage, even in emergency or crisis situations.\nFinally, employees cannot volunteer their work time to an employer.\n\nIf an employer is going to permit non-exempt employees to work from home,\nthere must be clear instructions, in writing, about the number of hours being\nworked, including wait times. For all employees paid by the hour, since they\nwill be working in their residence, there should be clear guidelines about\nwhether mealtime and breaks will be paid while the employee is working from\nhome. Careful records of time should be kept and reviewed regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the office or plant, keep track of overtime hours for\npersons having to stay longer hours due to substantial absences of others.\nMonitor exempt employees working longer hours so they do not fall below\nminimum wage. Remember exempt employees who take over the manual job duties of\nnon-exempt employees may become subject to overtime provisions. _(Even if the\nexempt employee does not complain or seek it, a union official or disgruntled\nemployee can report the situation to the USDOL)._ Finally, FLSA does not limit\nthe types of work employees may be assigned or required to perform, except for\npersons age 17 or younger.\n\n### **Workers\u2019 Compensation Issues**\n\nState Workers\u2019 Compensation laws are designed to offer medical and financial\nbenefits to workers \"injured\" in the scope of their employment. This includes\nphysical injuries resulting from accidents on the job _(many states have\neliminated the \"accidental\" requirement)_ , as well as occupational diseases\ndue to causes and conditions characteristic of, and peculiar to, a particular\noccupation. Employees claiming on the job exposure to communicable diseases,\ntesting either positive or negative, have been awarded benefits. The typical\nemployee is usually a health care worker, prison guard, or housekeeper in a\nfacility housing persons who have communicable diseases.\n\nFor an accidental injury, an employee must prove when and where the\ntransmission occurred (i.e., on the job). For an occupational disease, the\nemployee must prove a substantial connection between the worker\u2019s occupation\nand the transmission of the disease. Employers will need to check how their\nstate handles occupational disease claims of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other\ncommunicable diseases to better understand what may happen with Covid-19.\nBecause Covid-19 may become widespread, determining specifically when & where\nit was contracted may be difficult. Expect compensable claims will be limited\nto those who have a substantial connection between their occupation and the\ntransmission of the disease (i.e., health care workers, possibly overseas\nflight attendants).\n\n### **National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) & Unionized Employers**\n\nThere will be issues unique to unionized employers, from negotiated attendance\ncontrol policies, contracting out bargaining unit work, supervisors performing\nbargaining unit work, prohibition on assignments outside job classification,\ncontractual restrictions on overtime, and restrictions on needed flexibility.\n\nIf the employer is not in a position to obtain cooperation from the union at\nthe time, it should look at what emergency provisions are in its collective\nbargaining agreement and any past arbitration decisions interpreting emergency\nsituations under its past contracts. Consider negotiating a memorandum of\nunderstanding or MOU with the union to cover possible pandemic needs to\nmaintain the business. If that does not work, anticipate allegations of\nunilateral changes and the defense of exigent circumstances. When claiming\nexigent circumstances, the burden of proof is on the employer.\n\nConsider whether to negotiate with the union about:\n\n  1. Temporary modification of absenteeism policies & procedures and\n  2. Temporary changes to workplace rules and contracting out in order to maintain business during pandemic situation\n\nEach employer\u2019s circumstances with their union is different; one size does not\nfit all. However, expect most arbitrators will be unlikely to uphold\ndischarges for excessive absenteeism when there is proof of pandemic illness\nin a particular workforce or community, despite an employee\u2019s past history.\n\n### **Occupational Health & Safety Act (OSHA)**\n\nOSHA requires employers provide safe & healthful working conditions. With this\nmandate in mind, OSHA has the authority to create standards employers must\nfollow and can issue advisory guidance, including for standards applicable to\nCovid-19 in the workplace. See\n<https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html>.\n\nFor employers whose employees are not at a high risk of exposure, OSHA has\nsimply referred employers to the CDC guidelines summarized above. However, for\nemployers involved in businesses deemed higher risk (health care, death care,\nlabs, airlines, international travel, border protection, solid waste, and\nwastewater management operations) or are working in a business with someone\nalready diagnosed with Covid-19, there is other guidance. These businesses\nshould visit OSHA\u2019s hazard recognition webpage for instructions on evaluating\nthe risk of exposure; implementing and ensuring workers use controls to\nprevent exposure; and taking various control measures that may include\nengineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and using\npersonal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n### **HIPAA Privacy Considerations for Employers During the Covid-19\nOutbreak**\n\nAt times like this, employers may wish to know if an employee who has left\nwork with a fever or cough and is not coming to work is out due to a suspected\nor diagnosed case of Covid-19 and whether they may notify co-workers who have\nbeen in close contact with that employee. To what extent does HIPAA cover this\ntype of information?\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to disclosures made by employees, volunteers,\nand other members of a covered entity\u2019s or business associate\u2019s workforce.\n\u201cCovered entities\u201d are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those\nhealth care providers that conduct one or more covered health care\ntransactions electronically, such as transmitting health care claims to a\nhealth plan. \u201cBusiness associates\u201d generally are persons or entities (other\nthan members of the workforce of a covered entity) who perform functions or\nactivities on behalf of, or provide certain services to, a covered entity that\ninvolve creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting protected health\ninformation or \u201cPHI.\u201d Employer health plans are covered by the HIPAA Privacy\nRule, but employers generally are not otherwise covered ( _unless their line\nof business qualifies them as either a covered entity or business associate_\n). However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits covered entities to disclose needed\nPHI, without the individual authorization, when the disclosure is made to\nfurther the following public health activities:\n\n  1. Disclosures made to a public health authority such as such as the CDC or a state or local health department, that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability;\n\n  2. Disclosures at the direction of a public health authority, to a foreign government agency that is acting in collaboration with the public health authority; and\n\n  3. Disclosures to notify a person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or may otherwise be at risk of contracting or spreading a disease or condition, if disclosure is authorized by law or otherwise permitted using minimum necessary standard.\n\nThe Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS), the agency responsible for oversight of HIPAA regulations and\nenforcement, has issued a bulletin regarding the ways covered entities can\nshare patient information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule in an outbreak of\ninfectious disease or other emergency situation. The OCR bulletin is available\n[here](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/february-2020-hipaa-and-novel-\ncoronavirus.pdf).\n\nIn short, the HIPAA Privacy Rule will have limited applicability in a Covid-19\nresponse planning of employers, but privacy concerns of employees are still\nimportant! The key is to ensure the employers\u2019 Covid-19 plans do not involve\nor rely on PHI obtained from the employers\u2019 health plan. For example, if an\nemployee with Covid-19 submits a request for leave along with the results of\nhis/her virus screening, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would NOT come into play. Why?\nBecause the information was voluntarily provided to the employer by the\nemployee for employment purposes entirely unrelated to the employer\u2019s health\nplan activities. This information was provided to the employer not to the\nhealth plan. Once in the possession of the employer, the HIPAA Privacy Rule\ndoes not _per se_ impose any obligation to maintain the employee\u2019s information\nconfidentially. However, regardless of good intentions, do not take this as a\nlicense to disclose this information to other employees. Why?\n\nSome will say, refer to the ADA as the reason not to disclose. But the ADA\nprohibits an employer from sharing medical information regarding an employee\u2019s\ndisability with the employee\u2019s co-workers. However, it does permits such\ndisclosure to supervisors, managers, and emergency personnel who need to know.\nA diagnosis of Covid-19 would not ordinarily, by itself, be considered a\ndisability under the ADA. That is still not a reason to make unfettered\ndisclosures. These disclosures would still likely be considered a breach of\nthe common law right of privacy or possibly support a defamation claim, and\nthese are recognized in many state jurisdictions. For this reason, it is\nbetter to avoid identifying an individual to one\u2019s co-workers. We recommend\ninstead that the HR manager train supervisors to maintain confidentiality and\nprovide guidance as to how to respond to employee questions. Consider whether\nit makes sense for the company to designate someone as the person responsible\nfor handling all Covid-19 employee information and inquiries, such as an HR\nmanager or safety manager. Provide appropriate advance written notice to the\nemployee, if it becomes necessary to disclose information about an employee\u2019s\nCovid-19 status to protect those in the workforce who came in close contact\nwith that employee, especially if the situation is going to require employees\nbeing placed under quarantine or self-monitoring at home. In fact, it may\nbecome essential to advise particular employees who were in close contact (\n_employees who worked within six feet of each other for prolonged periods_ )\nthat they should be tested for Covid-19). Check to see if your state has any\nparticular medical privacy rules for applicability as well and what public\nhealth orders have been issued.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhen written in Chinese, the word \u201ccrises\u201d is composed of two characters. One\nrepresents danger and the other represents opportunity.

[\nover 745,000 people have been infected and over 35,000 have\ndied](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).\nAnd physicians in Hong Kong have discovered that [ those who recover from\nCOVID-19 may have long-lasting lung\ndamage](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-recovery-damage-lung-\nfunction-gasping-air-hong-kong-doctors-2020-3).\n\nBut there are secondary effects, too.\n\nMore people than ever are working from home, including [ Ford's global\nworkforce of more than 50,000\npeople](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-ford-employees-work-home-\nuntil-further-notice), [ NASA's 17,000\nemployees](https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-coronavirus-most-employees-\nmust-work-from-home-2020-3), and [ Google's North American\nteam](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-google-north-america-\nemployees-work-from-home-2020-3), which is tens of thousands of people (though\n[ their 135,000 contractors are still going to the\noffice](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-coronavirus-employees-\ncontractors-work-from-home-2020-3) because they lack remote access).\n\nSeveral US states and cities - such as Hoboken, NJ, and Washington state -\nhave [ imposed curfews](https://www.businessinsider.com/states-cities-\nshutting-down-bars-restaurants-concerts-curfew-2020-3), and [ six counties in\nthe San Francisco Bay Area are sheltering in\nplace](https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-lockdown-coronavirus-\ndisease-bay-area-2020-3) for three weeks, meaning people should do whatever\nthey can to stay inside.\n\nThough these decisions make sense, as they can (hopefully) [ help slow the\nspread and flatten the curve](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-one-week-\nenforce-social-distancing-flatten-curve-coronavirus-2020-3), they're having an\nincredibly detrimental impact on many businesses.\n\nBecause with these curfews comes the closing of bars and nightclubs. And in\nsome states, [ like Maine](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/number-maine-\ncoronavirus-cases-rises-42-mills-issues-executive-order-new-restrictions),\nrestaurants are no longer allowed to serve people (but they can do curbside\ntakeout), and Governor Janet Mills has strongly encouraged other \"non-\nessential public-facing businesses,\" like gyms, theaters, and hair salons, to\ntemporarily close.\n\nEven if all of these places were open, business would likely be slow, if not\nnon-existent, as so many people are barely venturing outside, if at all. And [\nthe current state of the stock\nmarkets](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/coronavirus-\nrecession-worst-wwii-economic-recovery-global-deutsche-bank-2020-3-1029012757)\nsurely doesn't help either.\n\n6.64 million people [ filed for unemployment last\nweek](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-\nfilings-record-labor-market-coronavirus-2020-4), doubling the previous week's\nrecord.\n\nCompass Coffee, a coffee shop chain in Washington, DC, said they've [seen\ntheir business plummet 90% in the past two\nweeks](https://www.instagram.com/p/B91v7UXp5Q9/). As a result, they shut down\nall of their locations for the next few weeks and [ laid off 90% of their 200\nemployees](https://www.popville.com/2020/03/dc-coronavirus-coffee-closures/).\n\nThey won't be alone in making tough decisions. Hundreds of thousands of\nbusinesses will have to make substantial adjustments in an effort to come out\non the other side of all of this, an especially tough undertaking given we\nhave no idea where the tunnel ends or what it'll look like once we emerge.\n\n[ Layoffs like the one at Compass are steadily increasing across many\ndifferent industries](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-layoffs-\ncompanies-laying-off-employees-list-2020-3), but some companies are choosing\nto furlough their employees instead, [ such as\nMarriot](https://www.businessinsider.com/marriott-withdraws-2020-outlook-as-\ncancellations-mount-due-to-coronavirus-2020-3) and [\nMacy's](https://www.businessinsider.com/macys-furloughs-most-employees-amid-\ncoronavirus-closures-2020-3).\n\nWhich begs the question, what exactly _is_ a furlough, and how does it work?\n\n#  What is an employee furlough?\n\nTo put it simply, an employee furlough is when employers require their staff\nto take unpaid leaves of absence. In other words, they won't work, they won't\nget paid, but they'll still technically be employed.\n\n![Adam\nCalli.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73adecc485400d9e4e4be2.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Adam Calli.\nsource\n\n    Adam Calli\n\n\"The employer does this to drastically cut costs in times of economic\ndifficulty, [whether for] the economy overall, or specific to a particular\nindustry, company, or location,\" explained Adam Calli, founder and principal\nconsultant at Arc Human Capital, a human resources consulting firm. \"For many\norganizations, labor costs (payroll tax and employee benefits) can be 70% of\ntheir operating cost! That's why this is where they look first to save money\nthe fastest.\"\n\nIt's important to note that these are different from layoffs. Furloughs are\nmeant to be temporary - employees are expected to return to work full time\nwhen the organization is ready - whereas layoffs are permanent.\n\nMany people might associate furloughs with government shutdowns, [ like the\n35-day one that started in late 2018 and extended through early\n2019,](https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-federal-workers-\nget-zero-dollar-paycheck-furlough-backpay-2019-1) but private companies can\nfurlough employees, too. Like manufacturing giant [ Honeywell, which\nfurloughed employees in response to the 2008\nrecession](https://hbr.org/2013/06/honeywells-ceo-on-how-he-avoided-layoffs).\n\nAnd some businesses, like landscaping and construction companies, practice\nregular furloughs during seasons when business is typically lower (it's hard\nto break ground in freezing temperatures). These, of course, are easier for\nemployees to prepare for because they know they're coming up every year.\n\n#  How do employee furloughs work?\n\nWhen facing tough financial times, leadership will identify which jobs they\ncan temporarily eliminate and when the mandated unpaid time off should begin.\n\n\"Sometimes, it's for a set period and the staff will know when they're\nexpected to return to [their normal work schedule],\" Calli shared. \"Sometimes,\nit's open-ended.\" In a case such as COVID-19, where there's still so much\nunknown, the latter is more likely.\n\n![J.R.\nSkrabanek.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73ae1fc485400dae0b66e5.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    J.R. Skrabanek.\nsource\n\n    J.R. Skrabanek\n\nThe main purpose of furloughs is for businesses to be able to save money by\nreducing staff and labor costs. This means they could put employees off work\n\"until further notice,\" or they could just cut back in certain ways. For\nexample, they could require employees to take unpaid leave one day per week or\none full week per month.\n\nBut, of course, it's not that simple, as employees are classified in different\nways. One of the main ways is exempt vs. non-exempt. Exempt employees are\nsalaried - they receive the same pay on a recurring schedule regardless of how\nmany hours they worked. Non-exempt employees are paid hourly.\n\nWhen it comes to furloughing, \"non-exempt employees can simply have their\nhours reduced and continue to be paid for those reduced hours,\" explained\n[J.R. Skrabanek](https://www.ts-firm.com/jrs), a partner at Thompson &\nSkrabanek, PLLC, which provides legal services for small businesses, startups,\nand freelancers.\n\n![Mikaela\nKiner.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73ae50c485402b3d3cf365.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Mikaela Kiner.\nsource\n\n    Mikaela Kiner\n\nFor exempt employees, it's different. \"[The Fair Labor Standards\nAct](https://ofm.wa.gov/state-human-resources/compensation-job-\nclasses/compensation-administration/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa) (FLSA)\nrequires employees to be paid their full salaries for any week in which any\nwork is performed,\" Skrabanek explained. If a full week goes by and the\nfurloughed worker hasn't done any work, then the employer doesn't have to pay\nthem their salary for that week. But, even if they just do one or two hours of\nwork, they must receive their full weekly paycheck.\n\nAccording to Mikaela Kiner, founder and CEO of\n[Reverb](https://reverbpeople.com/about/), a people operations consulting\nfirm, each company also needs to take into account the following legal\nconsiderations:\n\n  * Employees should be selected for furlough based on job responsibilities, without regard for race, gender, age, pregnancy, or other protected classes. \n  * Employees with a written contract or unionized employees may have terms that prevent furloughs. \"The employer and union must reach an agreement on the conditions of the furlough, and employers must be careful to ensure they meet all terms of the agreement,\" explained [Steven Katz](https://kpdfirm.com/steven-m-katz/), attorney at Katz, Pryor, and DiCuccio, LLP. \n\n![Joey\nPrice.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73aecfc4854074e3100a93.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Joey Price.\nsource\n\n    Joey Price\n\n  * Companies with a high volume of furloughs or layoffs may be subject to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. \"The WARN Act is a rule that applies to employers of 100+ and provides guidelines on how to inform and roll off employees in coordination with resources from the government,\" said [Joey Price, CEO of Jumpstart:HR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeyvprice), an HR outsourcing and consulting company for small businesses. This Act can be tricky, though, Katz added, as there are many exceptions. For example, it may not apply in a case such as coronavirus, since it was a circumstance that wasn't \"reasonably anticipated 60 days before termination.\"\n\n#  The pros and cons of furloughs\n\nThere are \"many advantages for the employer because the workforce can adjust\nto the needs of the business,\" said [Kay Van\nWey](https://www.vanweylaw.com/meet-the-team/), a medical malpractice attorney\nat Van Wey, Presby, and Williams Trial Law Firm.\n\n![Kay Van\nWey.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73af22c485405e9b294593.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Kay Van Wey.\nsource\n\n    Kay Van Wey\n\nThese pros for the business are quite obvious. They can save a ton of money by\ncutting down on labor costs and, hopefully, these measures will lead to them\nsurviving the difficult economic times. And, when conditions improve, they can\nbring back the same staff without having to recruit, hire, and onboard an\nentirely new set of employees.\n\nBut, one major downside for employers is \"business interruption,\" Van Wey\nsaid. \"If an employee in an office setting, for example, was furloughed, they\nleft everything right where it was and it will take time for them to catch up\nand get back on track.\" Plus, other employees who weren't furloughed will\nprobably have to take on their work, which can be overwhelming and slow things\ndown.\n\nWhile being temporarily terminated from a job is daunting, the main pro for\nemployees is that, should the business survive, they'll have a job to return\nto.\n\nAnd, \"a general rule is that [this] does not affect employee benefits,\" Katz\nsaid. \"All eligible employees are still entitled to benefits while on\nfurlough.\" So, that's a big positive when you compare it to a layoff.\n\n![Steven\nKatz.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/5e73ae8ac485400e0622014a.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Steven Katz.\nsource\n\n    Steven Katz\n\nBut, of course, there's a lot of uncertainty here. And, no matter which way\nyou spin it, employees are missing out on pay, though it's possible they can\nseek alternative sources of income while they're furloughed. \"The terms of the\nfurlough are specific to each employer,\" Skrabanek explained. \"Unless the\nemployee signs a furlough contract that explicitly forbids them from seeking\nadditional work elsewhere, they are free to do so.\" Price explained that\nemployees should be upfront with their secondary employer about their furlough\nstatus and when their primary organization plans to resume operations (if they\nknow). And, he and Skrabanek both emphasized that all employees should closely\nreview any noncompete policies their employer has. They also might be able to\n[ file for unemployment benefits](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-file-\nfor-unemployment-benefits-2020-3), though this [ varies by\nstate](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/find-\nunemployment-benefits.aspx). It's also important to note that some states\nallow people to work part time and receive unemployment benefits\nsimultaneously while others do not, so that's something to pay attention to as\nwell. Regardless, this uncertainty and the need for income may cause them to\ncompletely leave their current full-time job, which is an added downside for\nthe employer.\n\n_This article was originally published on Business Insider March 20, 2020.

Birx, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator speaks\nduring a press conference with members of the coronavirus task force in the\nBrady Press Briefing Room. The bill would mandate telework by any employee\ndeemed eligible and make those contracting the virus eligible for FECA\nbenefits.\n\nHouse Democrats have unveiled a Coronavirus relief bill that would provide or\nguarantee several financial benefits for federal employees while also\ntargeting Trump administration initiatives regarding federal employee unions.\n\nThe measure generally would mandate telework by any employee deemed eligible\nand require agencies to set new telework participation goals and explain to\nCongress any reduction in teleworking.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  \n\nIt also would mandate payment of weather and safety leave (administrative\nleave) for employees prevented from going to their regular work locations but\nwho cannot telework; require payment of hazardous duty pay for employees\nexposed in the line of duty to persons with COVID-19 or who have been exposed\nto it; and pay up to $2,000 a month to employees who are required to work and\nincur expenses related to the care of a child or relative who has COVID-19.\n\nAlso, there would be a presumption that \u201cany employee carrying out duties that\nrequire substantial contact with the public\u201d and who contracts the virus would\nbe eligible for FECA benefits.\n\nThe bill also would prevent enforcement of the three 2018 Trump administration\nexecutive orders limiting union rights and employee appeal rights as well as a\nrecent memo granting DoD broad powers to avoid dealing with unions by invoking\nnational security.\n\nThe bill further would wipe out the Postal Service\u2019s debt to the Treasury,\nmostly related to a requirement that it pre-fund health insurance for its\nretirees, while providing it a $15 billion line of credit for operating money.\n\nThe measure (HR-6379) was offered as the Senate continued to negotiate with\nthe White House over a separate relief measure (HR-748) differing in many\nways, leaving a potentially difficult task of resolving the two. One area in\nwhich they agree would be to suspend for 2020 the \u201crequired minimum\ndistribution\u201d from accounts such as the TSP affecting retirees age 72 or\nolder.\n\n[Agencies Can Change

The following are common questions regarding employee benefits\nissues that employers may face sooner rather than later. We will update this\nlist of questions and answers as the situation unfolds.\n\n### **Q1: IF AN EMPLOYER FURLOUGHS EMPLOYEES, ARE THEY STILL ELIGIBLE FOR\nGROUP MEDICAL PLAN COVERAGE?**\n\nIt depends. The terms of the group medical plan document or applicable\ncertificate of coverage will dictate whether employees who are no longer\n\u201cactively at work\u201d may continue active coverage. Most plans provide that an\nemployee who is not \u201cactively at work\u201d may only continue coverage for a\ndesignated period of time. After the expiration of this designated period,\nactive coverage will be terminated and the covered employee will be eligible\nfor COBRA.\n\nEmployers that maintain \u201cself-funded\u201d plans may have more flexibility, as they\nmay amend their plans to waive eligibility conditions and allow furloughed\nemployees to continue active coverage. (Note that some employers with fully\ninsured plans may be able to work out similar arrangements with their\ninsurance carriers.) Employers with self-funded plans that want to waive\nactively at work requirements or extend coverage while employees are on leave\nor furlough need to obtain the consent of their reinsurance carriers to avoid\nany coverage issues.\n\nFinally, employers utilizing an Affordable Care Act (ACA) lookback and\nstability approach to determine full-time status for health plan purposes\nshould consider whether affected employees are in a stability period that\nwould result in continued eligibility for the duration of the stability\nperiod. Reduced hours in 2020 might impact such employees\u2019 full-time status\nfor the next stability period (e.g., 2021 for plans using a calendar year\nstability period). Employers should also consider whether to provide relief\nfor such employees in future stability periods.\n\n### Q2: IF AN EMPLOYEE IS ON LEAVE BECAUSE HE OR SHE IS EXPERIENCING\nCORONAVIRUS-LIKE SYMPTOMS, IS THE EMPLOYEE ELIGIBLE FOR GROUP MEDICAL\nCOVERAGE?\n\nIt depends on whether the employer sponsoring the plan is subject to the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). If so, then the leave is likely protected\nby the FMLA, meaning that continued group medical coverage must be provided\nfor the period of FMLA leave, and the employer\u2019s policies regarding payment\nfor coverage during FMLA-qualifying leaves will apply. For employers that are\nnot subject to the FMLA, applicable policies and procedures regarding\ncontinued coverage during periods of sick leave will apply, as well as the\nplan terms and ACA full-time measurement and stability issues noted in Q1\nabove.\n\n### Q3: IF EMPLOYEES ARE FURLOUGHED WITHOUT PAY AND GROUP MEDICAL COVERAGE IS\nCONTINUED, HOW SHOULD THE PREMIUMS BE PAID?\n\nThere are a few options. First, an employer can cover the premiums for the\nfurloughed employees in order to keep coverage in place. When the employees\nreturn, the employer may attempt to recover the employee\u2019s share of the cost\nof the continued coverage from the employees. Alternatively, an employer may\nsend an invoice or coupon to covered employees during the period of leave,\nasking the employees to remit premium payments on an \u201cafter-tax\u201d basis. Other\npotential arrangements that employers may think about include \u201cpre-payment\u201d of\npremiums on a pretax basis or automatic deductions from pay upon return from\nleave. Relevant state law needs to be reviewed as well before making any\ndecisions about automatic deductions from pay.\n\n### Q4: IS TESTING FOR COVID-19 COVERED BY AN EMPLOYER\u2019S GROUP MEDICAL PLAN?\n\nIt depends. If an employer sponsors a fully insured plan, then the terms of\nthe plan will determine whether diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is a covered\nbenefit and what the participant must pay. Recently, a number of states have\nrequired fully insured plans to cover 100% of the cost of COVID-19 testing for\ncovered participants. In addition, several large insurers have announced they\nwill cover the cost of testing without cost-sharing and state and federal\ngovernments are rolling out no-cost drive-through testing locations.\n\nIf an employer sponsors a self-funded plan, then the plan is not subject to\nstate cost-sharing mandates, though such employers may want to consider\nwhether to provide coverage for COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing. Of\ncourse, they should check with their reinsurance carriers before making such\nchanges.\n\nOn a related note, the IRS recently released guidance clarifying that a high-\ndeductible group medical plan that waives cost-sharing requirements for\nCOVID-19 testing will not run afoul of rules that apply to health savings\naccounts that are paired with high-deductible plans. Therefore, employers\nsponsoring a high-deductible plan paired with an HSA will not face compliance\nissues if they waive cost-sharing for tests.\n\nNote: The US House of Representatives passed a bill on March 14 that requires\nall private \u201cgroup medical plans\u201d to provide testing for COVID-19 with no\ncost-sharing. We will monitor the status of this bill as it moves through the\nlegislative process. Technical corrections to the bill were approved by the\nHouse on March 16.\n\n### Q5: CAN EMPLOYEES TAKE HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS FROM A 401(K) PLAN IF THEY ARE\nFURLOUGHED WITHOUT PAY?\n\nIt depends on the standard that the 401(k) plan uses to determine whether an\nemployee is eligible for a hardship distribution. If the plan incorporates the\ntraditional regulatory \u201csafe harbors\u201d for determining whether an employee\nqualifies for a hardship distribution, then it is unlikely that a period of\nprolonged unpaid leave will constitute a covered hardship. (Note however that\npayment for medical expenses incurred in connection with treating COVID-19\nwill qualify under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d standard). If, on the other hand, the\nplan incorporates a different standard based on relevant facts and\ncircumstances, then prolonged financial instability may qualify. Most\nemployers utilize safe harbor hardship rules, and shifting to a facts and\ncircumstances approach should only be done if the employer has the\nadministrative capacity to handle reviews of each participant\u2019s financial\nsituation. Finally, many plans have outsourced hardship distribution reviews\nto their recordkeeper/trustee, and any changes should be coordinated with\nproviders.\n\n### Q6: ARE THERE HIPAA CONCERNS FOR EMPLOYERS WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19?\n\nHIPAA concerns come into play in an employer\u2019s role as a sponsor of a group\nmedical plan. If an employee presents with symptoms consistent with the\ncoronavirus, any medical information that the employer learns by virtue of\nsponsoring the group medical plan will be considered \u201cprotected health\ninformation.\u201d Such information can be disclosed only to the employee\u2019s family\nmembers and other individuals involved in the patient\u2019s care or to public\nhealth authorities. Information that is learned by an employer through means\nother than the group medical plan is considered \u201cconfidential\u201d and should be\ntreated accordingly, even though such information is not \u201cprotected health\ninformation\u201d under HIPAA. Therefore, we recommend that employers limit sharing\nany information learned about an employee\u2019s symptoms, regardless of the source\nof the information.\n\n### Q7: WILL EMPLOYEES BE ELIGIBLE FOR SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM DISABILITY\nPLANS DURING A PERIOD OF LEAVE?\n\nEmployees will only be eligible for these benefits if they personally are\nexperiencing medical difficulties relating to the coronavirus or some other\nillness. Employees who are furloughed without pay will not generally be\neligible for these benefit plans.\n\n### Q8: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DEPENDENT CARE ACCOUNTS DURING PROLONGED PERIODS\nOF LEAVE?\n\nIn order to be eligible to access dependent care funds, an employee must be\ngainfully employed. The general rule is that employees who are on leaves of\nabsence longer than two weeks are no longer gainfully employed, and therefore\ncannot submit expenses for covered expenses while on prolonged leaves of\nabsence. Given the cancellation of many child care arrangements, employees may\nwant to change their dependent care elections to reduce or cease\ncontributions. Employers should check their plan document regarding midyear\nchanges to determine whether such changes are allowed.\n\n\u00a9 2020 Jones Walker LLP\n\n  *   * [Printer-friendly](/print/article/employee-benefits-issues-coronavirus \"Display a printer-friendly version of this page.\")\n  * [Email this Article](/printmail/article/employee-benefits-issues-coronavirus \"Send this page by email.\")\n  * [Download PDF](/printpdf/124072 \"Display a PDF version of this page.\")\n  * [REPRINTS & PERMISSIONS](/reprints-and-permissions \"REPRINTS & PERMISSIONS\")\n\n## TRENDING LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n[COVID-19: Guide to Australia Taxation Measures\n(updated)](/article/covid-19-guide-to-australia-taxation-measures-updated)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[Indiana Governor Issues Updated Stay-at-Home Order Due to Continued Spread of\nCOVID-19](/article/indiana-governor-issues-updated-stay-home-order-due-to-\ncontinued-spread-covid-19)\n\nBy\n\n[Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C.](/organization/ogletree-\ndeakins-nash-smoak-stewart-pc)\n\n[COVID-19: System Security With a Remote Workforce](/article/covid-19-system-\nsecurity-remote-workforce)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[Coronavirus and Social Distancing Related Job Loss: Child Support and\nChildcare Related Issues](/article/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-related-\njob-loss-child-support-and-childcare)\n\nBy\n\n[Anderson & Boback](/organization/anderson-boback)\n\n[A Phishing Pandemic \u2013 Part II](/article/phishing-pandemic-part-ii)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[FAQ: Paycheck Protection Loans and Economic Injury Disaster\nLoans](/article/faq-paycheck-protection-loans-and-economic-injury-disaster-\nloans)\n\nBy\n\n[Ward and Smith, P.A.](/organization/ward-and-smith-pa)\n\n[Interim Rule Issued \u2013 Paycheck Protection Program](/article/interim-rule-\nissued-paycheck-protection-program)\n\nBy\n\n[Vedder Price](/organization/vedder-price-pc)\n\n[The Effects of COVID-19 on Support Orders](/article/effects-covid-19-support-\norders)\n\nBy\n\n[Varnum LLP](/organization/varnum-llp)\n\n[Underestimated Risks: M&A and German Employee\nInventions](/article/underestimated-risks-ma-and-german-employee-inventions)\n\nBy\n\n[Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP](/organization/squire-patton-boggs-us-llp)\n\n[Court Holds That A Deceased Testamentary Trust Beneficiary Can Still Be A\nBeneficiary](/article/court-holds-deceased-testamentary-trust-beneficiary-can-\nstill-be-beneficiary)\n\nBy\n\n[Winstead](/organization/winstead)\n\n[Take Caution with Filing Deadlines During COVID-19 Crisis](/article/take-\ncaution-filing-deadlines-during-covid-19-crisis)\n\nBy\n\n[Davis Kuelthau](/organization/davis-kuelthau)\n\n[The Importance of Reviewing and Complying with Performance\nBonds](/article/importance-reviewing-and-complying-performance-bonds)\n\nBy\n\n[Ward and Smith, P.A.](/organization/ward-and-smith-pa)\n\n[Too Much Time on Their Hands \u2013 New Executive Order Limits Time Period for\nTeam Telecom Reviews](/article/too-much-time-their-hands-new-executive-order-\nlimits-time-period-team-telecom)\n\nBy\n\n[Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP](/organization/sheppard-mullin-\nrichter-hampton-llp)\n\n[Judicial Council of California\u2019s Emergency Orders Affecting Employment\nActions](/article/judicial-council-california-s-emergency-orders-affecting-\nemployment-actions)\n\nBy\n\n[Jackson Lewis P.C.](/organization/jackson-lewis-pc)\n\n[Supreme Court Update: Citgo Asphalt Refining Co. v.

The new face of HR should not be faceless.\n\n![HR is a contact sport](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586178442/1586178441.jpg)\n\nThe factory looked like a war-zone. Much company property had been destroyed.\nThere were serious injuries. I won\u2019t reveal the nature of the injuries or when\nthis episode took place to prevent the organization where it happened from\nbeing identified. Besides, such explosions are frequent enough for us not to\nprobe the specifics of a particular instance. In nine out of ten cases of\nviolence at the workplace, the management is taken totally by surprise and has\nno time to plan counter-measures, leave aside preempt the conflagration. While\nmany people have analyzed the fundamental causes of industrial violence, my\nlimited purpose here is to understand why early warning systems, which could\nhave prevented the worst excesses, failed and how we can prevent such failures\nthat repeatedly catch us with descended lower-garments.\n\nThe single thread that is common to almost all workplace violence is a break\nin the chain of face-to-face communication between people at the Bottom of the\nPyramid and HR/ER people whose reports reach top decision-makers. The greater\nworry is that the newer models we are adopting for organizing and managing HR\nmake catastrophic failures in feedback channels more rather than less likely.\n\n> The height of fashion nowadays is to find a tech solution to every issue.\n> For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of naturally\n> intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared to be\n> the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots\n\n### Losing touch\n\nThe example at the start of this column illustrates the most prevalent reason\nfor HR losing personal touch with its most important constituency \u2013 people.\nWhile ever greater proportions of value-add have been shoveled into the hands\nof contract workers, the redirection of HR attention to what has, in many\norganizations, become the larger part of the workforce, is not just inadequate\nbut negligible. Rare is the ER/IR manager who actually meets with members of\nthe precariat even occasionally, and with a grievance resolution mindset.\nSmall wonder then that embers of discontent smouldering in that part of the\nworking population are overlooked till they burst into uncontrollable flames.\nYet, even if Indian industry gets over its addiction to contracted1 or\nuberized workers (I hope I have sufficient rebirths left to see either happen)\nor learns to give them the same ER care and support as it extends to its\nregular workforce, there are other fast-growing fashion trends that are\ndrastically reducing face-to-face communications with employees.\n\n> HR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\n> conversations with HR can be more practically beneficial are the skills the\n> HR practitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a\n> more realistic perception of their problems\n\nFirst comes the noble-sounding (but actually lazy) program to push HR tasks\n(especially the ones that can\u2019t be done in air-conditioned comfort behind the\nprotection of a computer monitor or in the luxury of a posh training centre)\nto line managers. The first casualty of the offloading drive is the messy but\nessential need to meet employees at all levels regularly. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\nIt is important for line managers also to be in touch with their teams through\nnon-task interactions. But there is no law that prevents a second channel of\ncommunication from being set up via HR. The value of such a parallel path\nbecomes blindingly obvious when the channel through the chain of command\nbecomes blocked or distorted, as it can all too easily in times of churn or\nstaffing by inexperienced supervisors. Even worse is the situation when the\nproblem to be reported lies somewhere within the same reporting hierarchy or\nwhen that channel is mis-utilized to message what suits an ambitious manager\u2019s\nagenda. If HR has given up its own eyes and ears, its people are reduced to\nbeing dumb Myrmidons, powerless to confirm or contradict faulty reports\nemanating through the line conduit, and simply carrying out their demands.\n\nAnother surefire recipe to lose touch with one\u2019s own people is to outsource\nthose activities of HR that yield a large volume of interactions across\nlevels. What is sneeringly called HR operations and considered untouchable by\nthe upper caste business partner elites is actually a treasure trove of\ninformation about what is truly happening and of all the corns and callouses\naffecting employee satisfaction. What is an extremely valuable by-product of\nproviding an employee service in-house, by the HR business partner, evaporates\nwithout a trace when it is outsourced and almost to the same extent when it is\ncentralized.\n\nThe height of fashion nowadays, of course, is to find a tech solution to every\nissue. For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of\nnaturally intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared\nto be the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots.\nWhile much of the debate in the community today is about whether chatbots can\ndo what a human HR professional does (and of the dangerous snafus they can\ncause)2, my concern here is the loss of face-to-face contact such a\nsubstitution brings. Bot solutions are doubly disadvantageous in this context.\nIn the first place, they leave employees feeling shortchanged that the\norganization doesn\u2019t deem them worthy of a person listening to their concerns\n(surely top management doesn\u2019t get bottled up like this). Even if employees\u2019\nproblems are solved, it is unlikely that they will feel grateful and indebted\n\u2013 those are not sentiments that can easily be felt towards bots or\ntransferred, from them, to organizations. Secondly, it will be very difficult\nfor bots to extract information of the preemptive type we have been discussing\nout of standard service requests and day-to-day grievances. Information that\ncan be used to forestall IR breakdowns, formulate policies or identify\nindividuals for progression or observation are by nature equivocal.\n\"Equivocality means ambiguity, the existence of multiple and conflicting\ninterpretations about an organizational situation\u2026 Equivocality means that\nasking a yes-no question is not feasible\u2026 The key factor in equivocality\nreduction is the extent to which structural mechanisms facilitate the\nprocessing of rich information.\"3 At the top of the ranking for dealing with\nrich communication is our humble, age-old accessory: face-to-face\ncommunication. Bots don\u2019t even enter the rankings.\n\n### Know your people\n\nUncovering or predicting disruptions in industrial harmony are certainly not\nthe only, or even the most important, benefits of Human Resources having\nregular human-to-human contact at all levels in the organization. Let\u2019s look\nat some more significant and hard-to-replace gains from this contact sport.\n\nCases abound of major transformation initiatives in highly regarded companies\ncoming to grief simply because they had no process in place for sounding out a\ncross section of employees before embarking on a major policy change affecting\nthem. Ongoing face-to-face contacts are not just invaluable for anticipating\nreactions to substantive people policy revisions (and possibly tweaking them\nin the direction of greater acceptability). They are equally useful for\nevaluating reactions on the ground once changes are announced and making quick\ncourse corrections before reactions and resistances reach the point when they\ncan only be assuaged by the bathwater, the baby and the baby\u2019s father, all\nbeing thrown out.\n\n> Listening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part\n> of an HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\n> flawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded\n\nAnother of the great advantages of face-to-face communication is that it is\ntwo way. Apart from using the opportunity to understand what is bothering\nemployees or gauging their reactions to impending policy pronouncements, such\ncontacts provide the perfect setting for credible communication of what is\nimportant to the company. There are plans and responses to competition that\nare difficult to explain believably in writing or through other one-way\nchannels. Moreover, when disaffected employees, hostile unions or unfriendly\noutsiders are spreading disinformation and it is deemed unwise even to\nacknowledge it by giving a documentary response, these meetings are among the\nfew ways in which employee opinion can be kept firmly favorable.\n\nOver the decades I have been privileged to observe the performance of hundreds\nof young men and women in HR/ER. One characteristic that distinguished those\nwho had a natural flair for dealing with people (and, hence, their outstanding\nsuccess in HR) was their insistence on spending most of their time with the\npeople they were supporting rather than at their tables in their offices.\nToday, those tables carry colorful computer screens with all the attractions\n(strictly professional, of course) the cloud has on offer and the offices are\nairconditioned. But if youngsters find it more difficult to tear themselves\naway from their work stations now, the need to meet with people in person has\nalso become more acute because transitory tenures demand more frequent\nmeetings if trust has to build before individuals move on. It is not only the\ndevelopment of young HR professionals that is assisted by constant people\ninteractions. It remains one of the few ways by which senior leaders\n(including CHROs) can keep their feet on the ground and retain a feel for what\nis happening at the grassroot level.\n\n### Help your people\n\nAs important as keeping HR aware of the reality on the ground and equipping it\nto craft successful policies and processes is the way in which regular face-\nto-face interactions with people can resolve issues troubling individual\nemployees before they fester into disaffection, destruction or departure. On\nthe positive side, there is also no substitute for such individual meetings by\nHR in the recipe for building commitment and belongingness among employees at\nlarge. By just listening to the problems, concerns and aspirations of\nindividuals, HR is signaling its commitment to the welfare and happiness of\npeople. No friend, however patient and available, can reaffirm the\nindividual\u2019s worth to the organization in this manner. It needs the commitment\nof a HUMAN Resource by HR to substantiate its stated intent of caring for\npeople. Of course, this requires that HR professionals are trained in active\nlistening4 so that the impact is positive even in those instances where they\ncannot provide useful counsel or more direct help.\n\nHR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\nconversations with HR can be more practically beneficial than talking things\nover with a friend or even a line supervisor are the skills the HR\npractitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a more\nrealistic perception of their problems while tapping their internal reservoir\nof strengths in coping with them. In addition to counselling is also the\nknowledge-base HR professionals should have about which policy or avenue of\nappeal is likely to be most efficacious. This should be supplemented by case\nknowledge of how employees in other parts of the organization have been aided\nin similar situations.\n\nWhile not always possible, there are a significant number of opportunities for\nHR practioners to intervene directly and solve problems. These interventions\nmay take the form of talking things over with the line manager (especially if\ns/he is the origin of the problem), championing the employee\u2019s case where\nthere is discretion in the hands of a senior HR or line decision-maker or\nproviding some limited coaching in overcoming an internal barrier to the\nproblem resolution. An external shared-service provider is hardly ever in a\nposition or sufficiently motivated to provide such help and an AI-bot is\nobviously much less so. Even if they were capable, the gratitude and\nconsequential commitment would not flow back to the company or to HR and\nwould, therefore, not be available for future 'drawal' when individual\nemployee support (aggregated over many instances) can make all the difference\nin managing a crisis or a transformation program.\n\nA competent HR professional with a well-tuned antenna should also be able to\nprovide secondary guidance to an employee. The initial contact may arise from\nan internal job interview, an employee approaching with a grievance or an\nemployee contact program but, as part of the dialogue, the HR interlocutor may\ndiscover an employee\u2019s talents, contact networks or side interests that could\nbe useful in another assignment or as a member of a task team or a voluntary\nactivity \u2013 something that may have never come to light otherwise.\n\n### Actively reaching all\n\nListening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part of\nan HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\nflawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded. Those seemingly\ntrivial interruptions by individual employees, far from being distractions,\nare HR\u2019s special moments of truth5 which demonstrate, employee by employee,\nwhether the knowledge, skills and empathy with which we claim to be so well-\nstocked, can actually be converted to practical problem resolution which, in\nturn, builds good will towards HR and the organization at large.\n\nOf course, employees feeling the need and having the trust to approach HR with\ntheir problems are just one source of opportunities for interaction. There are\nmyriads of others which fall into the laps of HR practitioners without any\neffort on their part. They can come from processes as varied as Q&A during\ntraining programs, counseling for late-coming, absenteeism or indiscipline\nhandling and even from exit interviews. Regardless of the process of origin,\neach of these opportunities for face-to-face interaction can help employees\nsolve problems and get developmental aid while yielding valuable feedback to\nand positive affect for the organization.\n\nRich as the yields may be from the interactions initiated by employees or\nother people processes, they cannot possibly cover all employees. In my bible,\nunless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on a regular\nbasis, HR is failing in one of key roles \u2013 knowing and solving people problems\nboth individually and systemically. To achieve this goal, organizations need\nto institute programs for reaching out to every single employee on multiple\noccasions each year. Every HR person from the CHRO down and including the ones\nworking in back office or routine clerical roles should spend between half to\na full day every week on this activity. For those HR people who do not meet\ncross-sections of employees as part of their job, these meetings would yield\nthe secondary benefit of knowing the reality and reactions of the ultimate\ncustomers who their policies or back office work support. To prevent the\nexercise from being threatening or perfunctory, those unused to employee\ninteractions would need to be given a brief orientation and everyone would\nutilize a basic checklist for the meeting followed by a brief on-line report.\n\n> In my bible, unless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on\n> a regular basis, HR is failing in one of key roles - knowing and solving\n> people problems both individually and systemically\n\n### Drop by drop\n\nCan such simple meetings really add up to much? Should they take us away from\nthe killer schemes that win us awards and get our names plastered all over the\nmedia? Thought leadership and pioneering projects are immensely fulfilling and\nperiodically essential. However, they cannot substitute the most fundamental\nand frequently used tool in the HR person\u2019s kit: the face-to-face meeting. At\nsuch times it is useful to remember (a slightly tweaked version of) Julia\nCarney\u2019s poem6 for children,\n\n_Little drops of water  \n_ _Little grains of sand,  \n_ _Make the mighty ocean,  \n_ _And the pleasant land.  \n_ _\u2026.  \n_ _Little deeds of kindness,  \n_ _Little words of cheer,  \n_ _Make our people happy,  \n_ _And drive away their fear._\n\n_Notes:_\n\n_1.[Visty Banaji, Udta Udyog \u2013 Industry\u2019s addiction to contract workers,\nPeople Matters, 15th September\n2016.](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/temporary-and-contract-\nstaffing/udta-udyogindustrys-addiction-to-contract-workers-14090)_\n\n_2\\.

This email discusses general information\nand should not be considered legal advice.\n\n### Employment Insurance:\n\nAnnouncements from the federal government on March 18, 2020, of proposed\nchanges give us some broad guidelines, without all of the details. The goal is\nto encourage people who are sick to stay home to flatten the curve. The new\nmeasures still have to be passed by Parliament (or a smaller subset for\nquorum) to become law \u2013 which is being arranged for next week but here is what\nwe know:\n\n  * **Sick Leave Benefits [EXISTING]:** For those ill, injured, or quarantined (including sent home by employer based on public health warnings), up to 15 weeks of Employment Insurance (E.I.) benefits. The normal one week wait period is waived and medical verification will not be required.\n  * **Regular Employment Insurance Benefits [EXISTING]:** Unchanged - employees laid off for shortage of work would be eligible. Currently, no specific announcement on waiving the waiting period. ** **Please note: In normal circumstances, unless it is a term of the employment contract (written/policy/practice), sending an employee home for shortage of work without pay is a breach of contract resulting in constructive dismissal. A short lay off may be forgiven under these circumstances, but if the interruption in pay is prolonged, employers will face this long term liability.**\n  * **Emergency Care Benefit [NEW]** \\- Designed for people who would not normally qualify for E.I. benefits (e.g. self-employed/part-time/not meet the minimum hours). We understand that this would provide up to $900 every 2 weeks for up to 14 weeks of benefits if the worker cannot work because of quarantine, self-isolation, or the worker has to care for loved ones who are sick.\n  * **Emergency Support Benefit [NEW]** \u2013 Designed for workers who lose their job due to the COVID-19 but who would normally be ineligible for E.I. benefits. This is also up to 14 weeks of benefits of an amount similar to E.I. benefits.\n\nWe understand that individuals will be able to apply for these benefits online\nwith a simple attestation instead of having to have independent medical\nevidence. And the hope is to have this available for direct deposit by\nearly/mid April.\n\n### Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Program\n\nThis program allows employers to establish a supplemental unemployment benefit\nplan (\"SUB\") to top up employees' E.I. benefits during a period of\nunemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work for in this case, COVID-19,\nor an illness, injury, or quarantine. Normally, any wages paid to an employee\nwould have to be reported and deducted from any E.I. benefits. With a\nregistered SUB, wages are not deducted from an employees' E.I. benefits and\nare not considered insurable earnings. As a result, this increases the total\nweekly amount that eligible employees receive. SUB payments are generally\nsubject to Canada Pension Plan and income tax deductions.\n\n### Requirements:\n\nWe highlight some of the key components of such a plan:\n\n1\\. It identifies the group(s) of employees covered by the plan (i.e. all\nemployees, hourly paid employees, employees at a certain location, etc.);\n\n2\\. It covers a period of unemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work,\ntraining, and/or an illness, injury, or quarantine;\n\n3\\. It requires employees to apply for and be in receipt of E.I. benefits in\norder to receive payments under the plan unless the employee is not in receipt\nof benefits because they:\n\n  1. Are serving the waiting period;\n  2. Have insufficient hours of insurable employment to qualify for E.I. benefits, or\n  3. Have received all of the E.I. benefits to which they are entitled;\n\n  \n  \n\n4\\. The combined weekly payment received from the plan and the E.I. weekly\nbenefit rate must not exceed 95% of the employee's normal weekly earnings;\n\n5\\. The plan must indicate the maximum number of weeks for which payments\nunder the plan will be payable and it must identify the start date and end\ndate of the plan;\n\n6\\. The payments under the plan must be financed by the employer and the\nemployer must keep a separate account for those payments;\n\n7\\. The plan must be registered with Service Canada prior to its\nimplementation and Service Canada must be given written notice of any change\nto the plan within 30 days of same; and\n\n8\\. The plan provides that payments received under the plan do not reduce or\nincrease any guaranteed annual remuneration, deferred remuneration, or\nseverance pay benefits.\n\nWe were hoping to see the loosening of the process but this has not been\naddressed yet. It should be noted that, until a plan is registered, any\namounts paid will be treated as earnings and may be deducted from the\nemployee's E.I. benefits.\n\nTo see the full article click [here]( http://www.mindengross.com/docs/default-\nsource/publications/federal-programs-for-workplaces-re-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=9)\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

The wage subsidy is intended to support and motivate business owners\nto keep their employees employed during the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged companies to rehire or recall\nemployees that they laid off over the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe Prime Minister stated that all companies \u2013 large, medium, small, and non-\nprofits \u2013 that have had a reduction in revenue of 30% will be eligible for the\n75% wage subsidy, regardless of their number of employees. Prime Minister\nTrudeau announced the following key points:\n\n  * The subsidy will apply to 75% of the first $58,700 earned, which could amount to payments of up to $847 per week;\n\n  * Employers are encouraged to top up their employees' wages with the remaining 25% of their salaries; and\n\n  * Payments will be backdated to March 15, 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister warned companies not to abuse the program, as there will be\nconsequences. A system of checks and balances will be implemented.\n\nIt is understood that the program will be based on the honour system, with the\nassessment of reduction in revenue to be measured after-the-fact. Companies\nthat cannot demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in revenue will be required\nto pay back the subsidy.\n\nAdditional details were provided on April 1, 2020 by Finance Minister Bill\nMorneau, the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International\nTrade, Mary Ng, and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Navdeep\nBains.\n\n  * The 75% wage subsidy is now referred to as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.\n\n  * There will be no overall limit on the subsidy amount that an eligible employer may claim.\n\n  * In addition to being available to taxable corporations and non-profits, the subsidy will also be available to individuals who are employers and to partnerships. Eligible employers will include employers of all sizes and across all sectors of the economy, with the exception of public sector entities. Public sector entities include municipalities and local governments, Crown corporations, public universities, colleges, schools and hospitals.\n\n  * The subsidy will be available for up to a 12-week period from March 15 to June 6, 2020, and it will be retroactive to March 15. When asked if it might be extended beyond this period, Minster Morneau stated that the situation will be evaluated as it unfolds. \n\n  * The following claiming periods apply:\n\n**Period 1** : March 15 \u2013 April 11 (reference period for eligibility will be\nMarch 2020 over March 2019)\n\n**Period 2** : April 12 \u2013 May 9 (reference period for eligibility will be\nApril 2020 over April 2019)\n\n**Period 3:** May 10 \u2013 June 6 (reference period will be May 2020 over May\n2019)\n\n  * For eligible employers established after February 2019, eligibility will be determined by comparing monthly revenues to a reasonable benchmark.\n\n  * Applications for the subsidy will be required to be made each month.\n\n  * In applying for the subsidy, employers will be required to attest to the decline in revenue, _i.e._ , revenue from its business carried on in Canada earned from arm's-length sources.\n\n  * The employer's normal accounting method to calculate revenue should be used, and would exclude revenues from extraordinary items and amounts on account of capital.\n\n  * The government will work with non-profit organizations and registered charities affected by a loss of revenue to ensure the definition of revenue is appropriate to their circumstances.\n\n  * The government is considering additional support for non-profits and charities, particularly those involved in the front line response to COVID-19. Details will be announced in the near term.\n\n  * Further guidance with respect to how to define pre-crisis weekly remuneration for a given employee will be provided in the coming days.\n\n  * For existing employees, employers may be eligible for a subsidy of up to 100 % of the first 75% of pre-crisis wages. Employers will be expected where possible to maintain existing employees' pre-crisis employment earnings.\n\n  * Employers will also be eligible for a subsidy of up to 75% of salaries and wages paid to new employees.\n\n  * Eligible remuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration: amounts for which employers would generally be required to withhold or deduct amounts to remit to the Receiver General on account of the employee's income tax obligation. It does not include severance pay, or items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle.\n\n  * A special rule will apply to the subsidy amount for employees that do not deal at arm's length with the employer. That amount will be limited to the eligible remuneration paid in any pay period between March 15 and June 6, 2020, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75% of the employee's pre-crisis weekly remuneration.\n\n  * Employers will have to keep records demonstrating their reduction in arm's-length revenues and remuneration paid to employees. More details about the application process will be made available shortly.\n\n  * Applicants will be able to apply for the subsidy on the Canada Revenue Agency's _My Business Account_ portal, as well as a web-based application.\n\n  * Employers must first pay their employees' wages and, after proving these payments, they will be reimbursed with the subsidy by direct deposit 6 weeks from the date when their application is made.\n\n  * All employers will be expected to make their best efforts to top up salaries to 100% of the maximum wages covered ( _i.e._ , to pay the remaining 25% of their employees' wages). There will be flexibility based on an understanding that some applicants may be unable to do so.\n\n  * An eligible employer's entitlement to this wage subsidy will be based entirely on the salary or wages actually paid to employees.\n\n  * It was again emphasized that there will be severe consequences for bad actors that abuse this \"high trust system.\" \n\n  * Penalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims, and anti\u2011abuse rules will be proposed to ensure that the subsidy is not inappropriately obtained and to ensure that employees are paid the amounts they are owed. The government is considering proposing to create new offences that will apply to individuals, employers or business administrators who provide false or misleading information to obtain access to this benefit or who misuse any funds obtained under the program. The penalties may include fines or even imprisonment.\n\n  * On March 18, 2020, the Prime Minister announced a temporary 10% wage subsidy. When an employer is eligible for both the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the 10% wage subsidy for a period, any benefit from the 10% wage subsidy for remuneration paid in a specific period would generally reduce the amount available to be claimed under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy in that same period.\n\n  * An employer would not be eligible to claim the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy for remuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a 4-week period for which the employee is eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).\n\n  * Employers that are not eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would still be able to furlough employees, who will receive up to $2,000 a month.\n\n  * The wage subsidy received by an employer will be considered government assistance and it will be included in the employer's taxable income.\n\n  * Government assistance received under either wage subsidy would reduce the amount of remuneration expenses eligible for other federal tax credits calculated on the same remuneration.\n\nAlthough the cost of this subsidy will be $74 billion, it will lower the cost\nof the CERB to $21 billion. Organizations that do not qualify for the 75% wage\nsubsidy may continue to qualify for the previously announced wage subsidy of\n10% of remuneration paid from March 18 to before June 20, up to a maximum\nsubsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer. Minister Morneau\nemphasized that Canadians should take into account the totality of the\nbenefits being offered by the federal government, which include:\n\n  * Deferral of GST and corporate tax payments until September;\n  * A $40,000 interest free loan for one year, at the end of which $10,000 will be forgiven if the loan is paid back;\n  * The continued existence of the previously announced 10% payroll deduction for small businesses; and\n  * The CERB, which is available immediately until the wage subsidy is in place (although Minister Morneau encouraged employers to rehire their employees without delay).\n\n### Bottom Line for Employers\n\nThe objective of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy is to prevent further job\nlosses, encourage employers to re-hire workers they have already laid off due\nto the COVID-19 crisis, and make it easier for Canadian companies and other\nemployers to resume normal operations when the crisis ends.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Layoffs are often reflexive first measure to reduce costs. This is a\nmistake. Instead, leaders should take several steps before cutting headcounts.\nFirst, be clear about the challenge with staff; second, brainstorm ideas for\nhow to reduce costs while saving jobs; third evaluate other options like four-\nday work-weeks, unpaid time off, and son. Finally, have \"ice in the belly,\"\nwhich means you should keep your cool as a decision maker while also remaining\ncompassionate and empathetic with your staff.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_19_1206948532-3.jpg)\nSanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-\nlayoffs?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.

For weeks, our corporate clients and contacts waved off concerns\nabout a potential economic impact from the Covid-19 outbreak. Then something\nchanged around March 9. First, our contacts told us they were restricting\nvisitors to their offices and encouraging remote work. Now, only a few days\nlater, we are hearing that many them are considering layoffs to ensure they\nmake it through the crisis \u2014 and a recent\n[survey](https://www.pwc.com/us/covid-19-survey?WT.mc_id=CT1-PL52-DM1-TR1-LS4-ND30-PRG6-CN_CFOPulseSurvey-&eq=CT1-PL52-DM1-CN_CFOPulseSurvey)\nfound that a vast majority of corporate leaders are considering some sort of\nfinancial action as a result of the pandemic.\n\nTo be sure, a cost-cutting reflex is understandable. Leaders are obligated to\nmake responsible decisions to keep their companies afloat. But those who\nmanage the economic effects of this crisis in a clear and compassionate way\ncreate more value for their companies and will come out of this pandemic\nstronger than ever before. So before announcing deep layoffs, we recommend\nthat you consider these measures first.\n\n**Communicate Openly**\n\nMany leaders assume that if they admit that the company is facing turbulent\ntimes it will scare away its best employees. The assumption is that these\nemployees will worry less if management holds their cards close to their\nchest. Nothing could be further from the truth. Everyone knows that we are\ngoing through a global pandemic. Everyone knows certain sectors of the economy\nare already getting hit hard by changes in consumer behavior as a result of\nthis virus. And everyone knows a slowdown in parts of the economy and\nincreased uncertainty might impact their company as well.\n\nInstead of forcing your employees to second-guess what might be in store for\nthem, be utterly clear with them about the financial health of your firm and\nwhat goals you will prioritize. These goals will not be the same for every\ncompany, and you shouldn\u2019t communicate empty statements you don\u2019t believe in,\nsuch as \u201cwe put our employees first.\u201d These statements can be confusing and\neven counterproductive when people are worried about their jobs. It\u2019s better\nfor you to be specific. For example, if your goal is to save jobs while\nmeeting your bank covenants, say that. If it is to make a series of changes\nswiftly to shore up job security, clarify that you are prioritizing that\ndecision over other, slower changes.\n\n**Share the Pain**\n\nIf you are doing cut backs to save job losses, you must lead by example and do\ncut backs that impacts your own day-to-day as well. If you don\u2019t, there is a\ndanger that your staff will feel like saps, doing sacrifices while the C-suite\ncontinues unaffected. Get a commitment for a pay cut from your senior leaders.\nAs CEO, you should take the largest salary cut yourself. Several airline CEOs,\nfor example, are temporarily [forgoing\nsalaries](https://www.hcamag.com/us/news/general/more-airline-ceos-take-pay-\ncut-amid-outbreak/216929) or taking pay cuts amid looming cutbacks for the\nindustry.\n\n**Consider Crowdsourcing Ideas with Employees**\n\nIt can be overwhelming to open the floor for ideas from employees on what the\ncompany should do. You might fear that employees will be resentful if their\nideas are not selected. You might also fear that asking your employees for\nideas means that you will appear to have less control. We know one CEO who\nslapped down the idea of such open consultation, saying, \u201cParticipation is one\nthing, pandemonium is another.\u201d But crowdsourcing doesn\u2019t have to be\nequivalent to chaos. In our experience, it is critical that you ask your\nemployees to voice their ideas. By showing them, not just saying, that you\ncare about what they think, you will have stronger buy-in for the initiatives\nyou eventually prioritize.\n\nFor example, when Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) undertook a\ncrowd-sourcing  approach to cost-cutting following the 2008 financial crisis,\nmost of the comments were positive; indeed, employees appreciated the openness\nso much that they defended the moves to disgruntled colleagues who wanted to\nlash out or sabotage the process.\n\nTo begin the crowdsourcing process, leaders should offer structure by\narticulating that you intend to prioritize initiatives with lower capital\nrequirements, lower risk profiles, proven positive impact on cash flow, higher\nchances of saving jobs, and so on. Then truly demonstrate that you are open to\nthe ideas of the staff.  You might even present the final packages to the\nstaff and let them indicate their preferences between the various options. The\nbottom line is, you lose no control by this kind of approach. You enhance your\nstanding as a leader.\n\n**Review All the Options (Even the Less Conventional Ones)**\n\nBefore layoffs, consider all your non-obvious options for reducing cost. A\nfour-day work week for roles where you have excess capacity will reduce staff\ncost by nearly 20% (assuming some costs will remain due to overhead and\nbenefits). Some employees might agree to working half-time if they know that\ndoing so will save jobs.\n\nYou can also offer employees the opportunity for unpaid leave if they so wish\n\u2014 framing this leave as a \u201csabbatical\u201d can help take some of the stigma of the\nabsence away. In fact, you might find that some employees welcome these\noptions and wish they could have had them all along. By making it clear that\none of your overriding goals is to avoid layoffs, you might find that\nemployees are amenable to the personal sacrifices inherent in salary-increase\nfreezes, halting bonuses, bans on overtime, pausing of payments into\nretirement funds, reduction of vacation days, and other cost-saving measures.\n\nConsider decelerating pay decreases for lower salary ranges to protect\nemployees who are the most vulnerable. For example, you might reduce salaries\nof your highest paid employees by 10%, mid-range salaried employees by 5%, and\neveryone else above a certain threshold by half of that. This is what was done\nat BIDMC during its cost-reduction\u2014and employees appreciated that senior\nleaders tried all sorts of creative approaches to minimize head-count\nreduction.\n\n**Have \u201cIce in the Belly\u201d**\n\nBeing a leader in turbulent times can be nerve wracking. If you act too fast,\nit might turn out that you overreacted. If you act too slow, the business\nmight go under. It would be wise to have what in Swedish is called _Is i\nmagen_ , \u201cice in the belly,\u201d roughly translated as your ability to keep your\ncool in a critical situation.\n\nFirst, recognize that as bad as things look, government assistance may be\nforthcoming. Many business leaders recall that there was resistance toward\neconomic stimulus packages in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Part\nof that resistance was due to public resentment towards bailing out financial\ninstitutions that had caused the crisis. The public is more likely to be\nsupportive of economic stimulus packages in the current case where the\ndownturn is hard to blame on one particular industry. And economic aid might\nalso be targeted towards companies that can prevent layoffs.\n\nFurthermore, don\u2019t treat all negative indicators for your business the same.\nIf your client is a movie theater and they need to pause your project, you\nhave reason to believe they will not be able to pick the project back up\nanytime soon since the theater industry is taking a big financial hit.\nHowever, if your client is a hospital that says they\u2019d like to pause your\nproject so that they can focus on the high volume of patients at the moment,\nit\u2019s worthwhile showing their management team that you understand their\ncurrent priorities.\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to explain to them that you are trying to understand what\nthe economic impacts of this pandemic will be on your firm and ask them if\nthey can have an open discussion with you to help you understand how likely it\nis that they will continue the project once things calm down.\n\nBut _Is i magen_ does not mean that you are cool to the needs of your staff.\nThis is a time to show empathy, rather than maintaining an emotional distance\nfrom your people. Lead with compassion, especially for the most vulnerable\nmembers of your company. One common misconception is that most people\nprimarily look out for themselves in turbulent times. On the contrary, our\nexperience is that during a crisis, individuals overwhelmingly prefer to make\nsacrifices if it means that their company can help more of their colleagues\nkeep their jobs.\n\nGoing through a downturn and making tough decisions to keep your company\nafloat is hard. However, if you lead with compassion you will touch the lives\nof your employees in an extraordinary way and come out of this potential\nslowdown stronger than ever before, enhancing the shared values of your staff.\n\n* * *\n\n[Atta Tarki](/search?term=atta%20tarki&search_type=search-all) is the founder\nand CEO of specialized executive-search and project-based staffing firm\n[ECA](https://eca-partners.com/).

Romeo ](/Author/1967182/Littler-Mendelson-Michael-R-\nRomeo?article_id=913162) and [ Sarah Bryan Fask\n](/Home/Redirect/1109046?mode=author&article_id=913162 \"View this authors\nbiography on their website\")\n\nLittler Mendelson\n\n__ 0 Liked this Article\n\n[ ![](/images/profile/individual/1967182.jpg) ](/Author/1967182/Littler-\nMendelson-Michael-R-Romeo?article_id=913162)\n\nTo print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on\nMondaq.com.\n\nThe City of Philadelphia launched the COVID-19 Small Business Relief Fund to\nassist businesses that are struggling as a result of city- and state-wide\nmandated business closures. According to city representatives, over $9 million\nin economic assistance is available in the Fund.\n\nAimed at mitigating the economic impact of COVID-19 on Philadelphians, the\nFund offers a mix of grants and zero-interest loans for select Philadelphia\nbusinesses that generate less than $5 million in annual revenue. The city\nhopes that these grants and loans will assist small businesses survive the\neconomic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis. Critically, money from the fund can\nbe used by small businesses to cover payroll during financially difficult\ntimes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Fund includes three tiers of possible financial assistance. The\nMicroenterprise Grant provides $5,000 per business, and is available for\nbusinesses with less than $500,000 in annual revenue. The Small Business Grant\nprovides up to $25,000 per business, and is available to businesses with\nannual revenue between $500,000 and $3 million. Finally, Small-Business Zero-\nInterest Loans, which provide up to $100,000 per business, are available to\nbusinesses with annual revenue between $3 million and $5 million.\n\nBusinesses can apply for assistance from the Fund through a\n[link](https://phila-\nuyims.formstack.com/forms/philadelphia_covid_19_small_business_relief_fund) on\nthe City of Philadelphia's website. The review committee, which reviews\napplications on a rolling basis, will consider the following criteria when\nawarding grants and loans:\n\n  * The number of jobs the business sustained prior to the effects of the COVID-19 economic impact;\n  * Whether the business can demonstrate that it has lost more than 50% of its revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n  * Whether the business can demonstrate a high likelihood that it can remain open when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides;\n  * Whether the business has experienced loss of revenue as a result of other situations (water main breaks, utility repairs, and street closures) prior to COVID-19;\n  * Whether the business provides jobs to low-income individuals, or is located in a high-poverty area;\n  * Whether the business has operated consistently for over 2 years; and\n  * In the case of sole proprietors and independent contractors, priority is given to those individuals located in high-poverty zip codes and/or individuals who kept in business multiple sub-contractors prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese criteria, however, are subject to change based upon the applications\nreceived.\n\nSmall businesses in Philadelphia are urged to review the details of the\nprogram and apply for relief if it would be beneficial.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Coming into January much of life\nseemed positive; how rapidly reality can change. I am reminded of Charles\nDickens\u2019 novel, \u201cA Tale of Two Cities.\u201d The novel opens with, \u201cIt was the best\nof times, it was the worst of times.\u201d That sums up the last three months.\n\nThe world has changed in just a few months. These have become dangerous and\nuncertain times for each of us, our families, our clients and their employees,\nand prospects. We\u2019ve all had to get used to a new reality, one that is filled\nwith daily updates regarding the number of infections and deaths around the\nworld and where we live. We seemingly overnight have learned a new vocabulary:\n\u201csocial distancing,\u201d \u201cself-quarantine\u201d and \u201cshelter in place.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve had to adapt to various restrictions on our mobility, access to products\nand services, supply-chain shortages, and personal isolation. Gathering places\nlike restaurants and bars have been shuttered; millions of hard-working people\nare suddenly unemployed through no fault of their own; and 75% of hotels\nnationally are vacant. Part of the very soul of our lives has been temporarily\nsevered: weddings have been indefinitely postponed; funerals have been put on\nhold; worshipping at church services has moved online; and family gatherings\nhave become virtual. That\u2019s a lot to absorb in a matter of weeks. And yet, we\nare doing it. We have adjusted our business and social behaviors and together\nwe will emerge from this a stronger and better society. We all must persevere.\n\nIn the meantime, while your employees are sheltering and you are somewhat\nhunkered down, we still have businesses to run and our clients need us now\nmore than ever in our lifetimes. Think about it: your clients and prospects\nare concerned, anxious, scared, or worse. They need a trusted adviser to help\nthem get through this crisis. You need to rise to the occasion; that\u2019s what\nbusiness leaders do to help the customers they serve during difficult times.\n\nSo what strategies can you and your team implement? These unprecedented\ncircumstances require some creative, out-of-the-box thinking. It\u2019s not\nbusiness as usual. Let\u2019s face it, your clients and prospects do not want to\nmeet with you in person. For that matter, you and your employees are likely\nworking from home at least part of the week. So where does that leave you?\n\nConsider immediately developing a marketing and communications campaign to\nmaintain regular contact with existing clients, prospective clients, and\nimportant business relationships. Elements can include:  \n\n  * Twice weekly or weekly email campaign to your entire database providing updates, commentary on changes in laws, regulations and restrictions\n  * Regular blog content on pertinent topics that can be archived in a library on your website\n  * Periodic webinar series, including PPT presentations, regarding relevant issues such as cost-containment strategies, sources of business financing, best practices in HR, labor law concerns, new voluntary or lifestyle benefits, etc. \n\nYou may have to reach out to some of your important business relationships\n(attorney, accountant, banking relationship) and ask them to collaborate with\nyou. That\u2019s fine; they are in the same boat as you are right now anyway, and\nshould welcome the opportunity to maintain positive contact with the market\nplace. And they can include their clients in your campaign which can\npotentially lead to more business for your firm, as well for their\norganization.\n\nRight now your clients and prospective clients have the time to spend learning\nnew approaches to managing their business operations and they have a very\nactive interest in hearing from a valuable and trusted adviser. You cannot be\nfrozen like a deer in the headlights. It\u2019s time to be proactive. Your business\nand family relationships are counting on you. Now more than ever before, you\nneed to leverage telephonic and electronic communications to stay connected\nwith your community. This is a winning strategy. I know, because we have\nhelped any number of advisers over the years to create these kinds of\ncommunication campaigns, and that was long before the current crises. Consider\nthat with the current working environment, you have a much more receptive\naudience to your message that also has time to absorb what you are\ncommunicating. And most of all, they need your advice and counsel. Step up and\nmake a difference. Everyone will be better for it.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51daefa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/100x100+0+17/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F2e%2F12%2F834c02ea4cfa99f1fda1ae48784a%2Fkwicien1.jpg)\n](https://www.employeebenefitadviser.com/author/jack-kwicien)\n\n[Jack

By the end of 2019, more\nthan 600 cannabis employees got pink slips. Industry experts expect more of\nthe same in 2020 as investigations, lawsuits and slumping valuations plague\nthe industry.\n\nUnfortunately for employers, layoffs are where the issues begin - not end.\nEspecially for those without established policies and procedures. Without\nrules and regulations governing employment practices, business owners and\noperators are at considerable risk.\n\nThe 11 states where cannabis is legal for recreational use and the 33 where\nit\u2019s medically legal tend to have more onerous employment practices liability\n(EPL) laws, where liability is often assumed by the employer for mistakes like\npoorly handled layoffs. This is further compounded by the fact that HR\ndepartments at fledgling cannabis companies tend to be small or non-existent\nand often ill prepared to deal with the legalities that come with termination.\n\nEnsuring the right practices are in place prior to any layoffs is critical. Is\nyour company facing employee terminations? Are you knowledgeable of how to\nhandle it? Consider the following best practices:\n\n  1. **Document problematic employees.** Create a folder for each employee and document the details when problematic situations escalate to the point they need to be addressed. Should employees of a protected class engage in an EEOC, class action or personal lawsuit after they\u2019re terminated, you\u2019ll need this documentation to support your actions.\n  2. **Create a formal termination procedure.** Make sure the procedure includes well-thought-out details of your review process, including how employee performance is evaluated and what happens when those standards aren\u2019t met. Spell out which behaviors are grounds for dismissal. When talking to the employee about a termination, have another employee or manager in the room to avoid claims of mishandling later on, typically their direct manager, someone from HR or your in-house attorney. Determine how the distribution of final compensation such as medical insurance or PTO will be handled so you\u2019re prepared to answer those questions. These procedures should be spelled out in an employee handbook given to all at onboarding so there are no surprises.\n  3. **Retain a qualified EPL attorney.** Create a relationship with a qualified EPL attorney (not your cousin who does divorce law) to help you set policies and procedures initially and to consult with when a unique or particularly difficult situation arises.\n  4. **Get the right EPL coverage.** An EPL policy will defend a business from claims of breach of employment contraction, negligent evaluation, failure to employ or promote, wrongful termination, deprivation of career opportunity and mismanagement of employee benefits plans. Your EPL coverage will be determined by your location, clientele, employee profile and what you see as your biggest risks. When discussing the policy with your broker, weigh the following considerations to EPL coverage: \n    * Reimbursement coverage versus pay on behalf. Should the policy pay your defense costs directly, or will you lay out the money and they\u2019ll reimburse?\n    * The definition of a claim and wrongful act will be different for each EPL policy.\n    * EPL policy\u2019s limit structure. Do you want defense limits to be outside or inside the coverage?\n\nHaving to lay off employees is never an easy choice for an employer. Make sure\nyou and your business do everything right before and during the process so\nthat the aftermath isn\u2019t even more difficult, filled with lawsuits and\nliability claims.\n\n### Share

The BC\ngovernment is working on legislating job protections for employees, which may\nchange the landscape, but there are currently a few common approaches to\nbusiness closures.\n\nOne option is to consider temporary layoffs. There has been much commentary\nlately on educating employees about their right to refuse a temporary layoff,\nbut the uncertainty around the pandemic has changed some of the risks\nassociated with this option.\n\nAnother option can be terminations. This option is drastic and may create\nfuture issues as well as immediate liabilities. Careful consideration should\nbe given before proceeding with terminations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty of how long the current measures may last, some\nbusinesses are continuing to pay their employees who are off work due to a\nclosure. For practical reasons, this may not be financially possible, but can\nhave significant long-term advantages.\n\nLastly, the government has programs in place to support businesses, which are\nexpected to be rolled out in April. These programs include limited payroll\nsupport of up to 10% with certain applicable maximums for qualifying\nbusinesses and a streamlining of the application process and eligibility\ncriteria for the federal Work Share Program.\n\nDetermining the best option involves considerations specific to your business\nand a careful weighing of the risks and benefits.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific\ncircumstances._\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\n[![](/images/profile/individual/1748310.jpg)](/Home/Redirect/1748310?mode=author&article_id=913696\n\"View this authors biography on their website\")\n\nAndrea Raso\n\nClark Wilson LLP\n\n[ ![](/images/Author-Details.png) ](/Author/1748310/Clark-Wilson-LLP-Andrea-\nRaso?article_id=913696 \"More from Andrea  Raso\")\n\n[![](/images/profile/individual/1852360.jpg)](/Home/Redirect/1852360?mode=author\n\"View this authors biography on their website\")\n\nAnne Amos-Stewart\n\nClark Wilson LLP\n\n[ ![](/images/Author-Details.png) ](/Author/1852360/Clark-Wilson-LLP-Anne-\nAmos-Stewart?article_id=913696 \"More from Anne  Amos-Stewart\")\n\n[![](/images/profile/individual/1657898.jpg)](/Home/Redirect/1657898?mode=author\n\"View this authors biography on their website\")\n\nCatherine Repel\n\nClark Wilson LLP\n\n[ ![](/images/Author-Details.png) ](/Author/1657898/Clark-Wilson-LLP-\nCatherine-Repel?article_id=913696 \"More from Catherine  Repel\")\n\nARTICLE TAGS\n\n[Canada](/7/39/0/0) [Employment and HR](/7/39/5/0) [Employee Benefits &\nCompensation](/7/39/5/116) [Redundancy/Layoff](/7/39/5/117)\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES ON: Employment and HR from Canada\n\n[COVID-19 And The Workplace: Employer Obligations](/canada/health-\nsafety/907086/covid-19-and-the-workplace-employer-obligations)\n\nTorys LLP\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 across the world\u2014and the resulting calls for social\ndistancing\u2014raise a number of unique issues for employers.

with company cars who are unable to use them because of the\ncurrent lockdown are to be granted some relief on the tax they pay on their\ncar benefit.**\n\nHM Revenue and Customs will not see cars as \u201cavailable\u201d for benefit-in-kind\ntax purposes if employees are able to \u201cvirtually\u201d hand the car back to their\nemployer \u2013 by posting their keys, for example.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by law firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, which had\nbeen lobbying HMRC to relax benefit-in-kind taxation on staff with company\ncars. However, it has urged the government to go further to ensure employees\nwith this benefit are not penalised while they are unable to use their\nvehicles.\n\n\u201cHMRC\u2019s decision that company cars won\u2019t be seen as available for benefit in\nkind tax purposes where they are \u2018virtually\u2019 handed back, by returning keys\nand fobs, was a positive move,\u201d said Nigel Morris, employment tax director at\nMHA MacIntyre Hudson. \u201cHowever, it perhaps does not go far enough in dealing\nwith the associated issues of having a car that can\u2019t be accessed, moved in an\nemergency situation or maintained \u2013 which the industry and HMRC may need to\nconsider.\u201d\n\nMorris told Personnel Today that adjustments were usually made to the benefit-\nin-kind tax deductible from an employee\u2019s salary if the company car was not\navailable; if they were in for repair, for example. However, this relief is\nnot offered if the period the car is unavailable is less than 30 days.\n\nThe law firm is now urging HMRC to lower this 30 day period to 21, to allow\nthe relief to kick-in earlier.\n\n\u201cOtherwise even handing back may not save benefit in kind tax for drivers, or\nNational Insurance Contributions for employers if the car is reinstated within\n30 days [if the lockdown lifts],\u201d Morris said.\n\nMorris advised that employers should also consider revising their policies\naround private fuel benefit \u2013 for example, if they received funds for personal\nfuel use via company fuel card \u2013 if employees were unable to drive their\ncompany vehicles. This would prevent employees from being taxed on a benefit\nthey cannot use.\n\n\u201cEven if a car is not withdrawn the private fuel benefit can be, as this does\nnot need a physical return of the fuel card. It will, however, need a change\nof policy and employee agreement to proportionally reduce their benefit while\nthe car remains unavailable. Companies wishing to make this decision need to\ntake action by 6 April and should speak to their advisers urgently for the\nappropriate guidance,\u201d he said.\n\n## Compensation and benefits

organizations keep employees engaged during\nlockdown\n\nOrganizations cannot afford to put a hold on their employees\u2019 capability\nbuilding in these uncertain times.\n\n![How remote learning can help organizations keep employees engaged during\nlockdown](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586161051/1586161050.jpg)\n\nWith many governments directing people to stay at home as they fight the\nCovid-19 pandemic, organizations have resorted to remote working. While this\nmay not be feasible across all industries, the ones that are able to apply a\nwork-from-home policy are faced with challenges to ensure their employees stay\nengaged, motivated and productive during this downtime.\n\nAs employees embrace this change in the workplace, organizations must reassure\nthem that, apart from safety, their personal and professional development is a\ntop priority. By highlighting the importance of learning, reskilling and\nupskilling on the skills of tomorrow, organizations will instinctively keep\nemployees engaged and motivated in these uncertain times.\n\n### Remote Learning for everyone\n\nWhile some industries are more readily able to transition smoothly into remote\nworking, many are at the starting line of adapting to such changes. The\nexperience may also vary by generation as the younger and tech-savvy\ngeneration will embrace it with open arms. Regardless, employees are\nencouraged to make the best of the time at hand and dedicate specific learning\nhours to undertake digital learning programs. These courses are part of their\ndevelopment process and help employees acquire new perspectives and skill sets\nwhich are essential in today\u2019s dynamic business environment.\n\nThere are many people who have little or no experience of working from home.\nFor such first-time remote workers, self-paced learning programs on how to\nwork remotely, use digital collaboration tools, maintain productivity levels\nand working in virtual teams will be of immense help as they ward off feelings\nof loneliness and social distancing.\n\n### Building an effective digital learning culture\n\nDigital learning programs will come in handy especially for those who work in\nthe field and get little or no time to upgrade their skills. It\u2019s a perfect\nopportunity for them to undertake certifications and enhance their existing\nskillset which could emerge as a positive long-term benefit in their careers.\nManagers, on the other hand, need additional resources on how to manage\nvirtual teams, deal with their team\u2019s well-being while continuing to be a\nleader the team looks up to.\n\nManagers also need to consider the emotional and social factors of their team\nmembers as they hone on their supervision skills via these learning programs.\nBy providing digitally enabled experiences to their workforce across all\nsegments, from frontline executives to managers and senior leaders\norganizations can reap the benefits of digital learning and continue to build\nthe foundation for an effective digital learning culture.\n\nBy expanding learning opportunities, providing various resources for\ncontinuous professional development and keeping employees engaged during this\ndifficult period, organizations can enable a digital workforce prepared for\nthe future.\n\n**_As Alvin Toffler, the futurist rightly said, \u2018The illiterate of the future\nwill not be the person who cannot read. It will be the person who does not\nknow how to learn\u2019._**\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

The bill now goes to the United States\nSenate, and if passed, thereafter reconciled with the House version and then\npresented to the President for his signature.\n\nIn short, the bill, among other things: (1) extends and expands the\nprotections of FMLA job-protected leave for certain coronavirus-related\nabsences, including requiring paid FMLA leave benefits; (2) provides a new\npaid sick leave entitlement for similar absences; and (3) provides tax credits\nto help employers defray the costs of paying these benefits. Importantly, the\nbill is drafted such that these new entitlements would remain in effect for\n2020. We outline key portions below and will continue to provide updates as we\nawait further legislative developments.\n\n  1. #### **The bill expands the FMLA\u2019s reach to provide job protection and partial wage replacement for impacted employees.**\n\nThe Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act would amend the Family\nLeave and Medical Leave Act of 1993 by permitted eligible employee to use FMLA\nleave related to a public health emergency. Below are key considerations for\nemployers related to these amendments:\n\n  * This new leave entitlement would apply to employers with _fewer than 500 employees_ and employees working for at least 30 days for a covered employer would be eligible immediately to use leave. It may also exclude employers with fewer than 50 employees where a hardship exemption applies.\n\n  * Eligible employees make take up to twelve (12) weeks of job-protected FMLA leave for the following reasons:\n\n  1. To comply with a recommendation or order by a public official or health care provider to quarantine due to exposure to or symptoms of coronavirus and the employee could not perform the essential functions of the job while also complying with such recommendation or order;\n\n  2. To care for a family member who is in quarantine based on a recommendation or order due to exposure to or symptoms of coronavirus; and\n\n  3. To care for a child if the child\u2019s school or place of care has been closed, or the child-care provider is unavailable, due to coronavirus.\n\n  * The first 14 days of FMLA leave is _unpaid_ , but employees may _elect_ to substitute accrued vacation, personal leave, or sick leave for leave under this section. An employer may not require such substitution.\n\n  * After the 14 days are exhausted, employers must pay the employee not less than two-thirds of an employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for each day of FMLA leave taken thereafter. There are separate provisions regarding this paid leave benefit for employees subject to a multi-employer collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  * For the most part, this is job protected leave. Employers can still take actions that will not provide any greater right to employment than those not on leave, and further, there are some additional limitations to job protection rights for employees working at an employer with fewer than 25 employees. \n\n  * The law would go into effect just 15 days after passage and would remain in effect until December 31, 2020. \n\n  2. #### **The bill provides a new paid sick leave entitlement to impacted employees.**\n\nThe Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act would permit employees to use sick leave\nrelated to the Coronavirus, the key components of which are set forth below.\n\n  * Like the FMLA expansion, this would apply to employers with _fewer than 500 employees._\n\n  * All full-time employees (subject to limited exceptions) regardless of their length of employment would be entitled to take 80 hours paid sick leave immediately. Part-time employees would get a pro-rated amount. \n\n  * These new sick leave amounts are in addition to and not in lieu of any other statutorily provided or employer-provided paid sick leave benefits, and further, employers must permit employees to use Coronavirus-related sick leave before other sick leave. \n\n  * These amounts cannot be carried over into the new year, nor are they paid out at termination.\n\n  * Employees could use this sick leave to: \n\n  1. self-isolate because the employee is diagnosed with coronavirus;\n\n  2. obtain a medical diagnosis or care if such employee is experiencing the symptoms of coronavirus;\n\n  3. comply with a recommendation or order by a public official or health care provider to quarantine due to exposure to or symptoms of coronavirus;\n\n  4. care or assist a family member who is self-isolating because of a coronavirus diagnoses or who is experiencing symptoms of coronavirus and needs to obtain medical diagnoses or care;\n\n  5. to care for a child if the child\u2019s school or place of care is closed or the child-care provider is unavailable.\n\n  * Employers are required to pay employees at their regular rate of pay during the sick leave period regarding their own coronavirus-needed leave, and at two-thirds of their regular rate of pay if they are taking leave to care for a family member or because of school closure or child-care related issues. \n\n  * Employers must post a notice related to this section in a conspicuous place in the workplace. A model notice will be provided by the Department of Labor within 7 days of enactment of this bill.\n\n  * The law would go into effect just 15 days after passage and would remain in effect until December 31, 2020. \n\n  3. #### **The bill provides tax credits to employers paying out leave benefits.**\n\nThe Tax Credits For Paid Sick And Paid Family And Medical Leave provides a\nrefundable tax credit equal to 100% percent of qualified paid leave benefits\npaid by an employer subject to certain caps and offset against social security\ntaxes paid by the employer.\n\n  4. #### **What\u2019s next and what to expect.**\n\nPresident Trump has signaled, via tweet, his approval of the bill, and the\nSenate may vote on some version of it very soon. Because these benefits will\nbe available to employees almost immediately after enactment, employers should\nplan to the following:\n\n  * Confirm employee headcount, taking into account part-time employees and any planned layoffs, to determine which provisions of the bill would apply;\n\n  * Think about drafting a stand-alone emergency leave policy that outlines these FMLA and sick leave rights, with an eye for ensuring that this policy aligns with the company\u2019s leave of absence, sick leave, and PTO policies;\n\n  * Prepare to account for the new paid FMLA and sick leave entitlements from a financial/accounting perspective;\n\n  * Consider potential fluctuations in staffing levels in anticipation of employees taking advantage of these leave entitlements this calendar year; and\n\n  * Be mindful of parallel or overlapping leave and PTO requirements under applicable state and local laws.\n\n\u00a91994-2020 Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C.

The following Frequently Asked\nQuestions (FAQs) are designed to address some of the more common questions\nthat employers with operations in South Korea currently face, including how to\nhandle safety and health rules, travel restrictions, privacy of employees'\nhealth information, compensation, and other employment issues. Employers are\nalso encouraged to consult relevant guidance and FAQs put forth by the [World\nHealth Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-\ncoronavirus-2019) (WHO), the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) (links in\n[English](https://www.moel.go.kr/english/main.jsp)/[Korean](http://www.moel.go.kr/index.do)),\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\n\n### TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\n**_1\\. Should an employer restrict travel to all \"affected areas\" where there\nhave been confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections, as reported by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO)?_**\n\nThe [Ministry of Employment and\nLabor](https://www.moel.go.kr/english/main.jsp) (MOEL) highly recommends\nrestricting employee travel to areas affected by COVID-19. As employers have\nan obligation to safeguard employees' health, it is advisable for employers to\nimpose such restrictions on business travel.\n\nNotably, the MOEL has not expressly prohibited business travel to affected\nareas. Accordingly, if an employer has a business necessity to send an\nemployee on business travel to an affected area, the employer should ensure\nthe employee works from home for 14 days after returning from such travel to\navoid contact with other employees and therefore fulfill its duty to protect\nthe well-being of its employees.\n\n**_2\\. What should an employer do if an employee shares that they plan to\ntravel to an affected area?_**\n\nAn employer should warn the employee that such travel may adversely affect the\ngeneral health of other employees in the workplace and that the employee will\nbe quarantined at home after the travel. An employer may further warn that the\nresulting quarantine may impact the employee's wages.\n\n**_3\\. How should an employer handle employees who have family members who\nhave traveled to affected areas?_**\n\nAn employer may require such employees to work from home, following MOEL's\nsafety guidelines that exposure to the virus poses a risk for infection and\ntransmission to others.\n\n**_4\\. Can we prevent employees from traveling to affected areas for personal\nreasons?_**\n\nNot directly, but an employer can reduce the likelihood of such travel by\nreminding the employee that the resulting quarantine may be unpaid.\n\n### DISCRIMINATION LAW\n\n**_5\\. What discrimination issues should employers address/be aware of?_**\n\nTaking measures solely based on the impact of COVID-19 would not likely be\nconsidered discriminatory. Still, employers in Korea must remember to treat\nfixed-term and part-time employees with the same benefits and working\nconditions as full-time permanent employees. Otherwise, this could lead to\nunlawful discrimination.\n\n**_6\\. What are the employer 's obligations to prevent harassment of those\nsuspected of being infected?_**\n\nKorea recently adopted a workplace anti-harassment scheme to prohibit\nbullying. An employer must make sure that an employee is not harassed or\nbullied for any reason, including any reason arising out of the coronavirus.\n\n### DISABILITY LAW\n\n**_7\\. Can employers take the temperature of employees who are coming to\nwork?_**\n\nUnder a MOEL guideline, issued on February 24, 2020, temperature screening is\nlikely to be allowed in light of the concerns for public health and safety.\nAlso the Personal Information Protection Act does recognize an exception to\ndata privacy restrictions for public health and safety reasons. Employers,\nnonetheless, must protect employee's right to the privacy of their medical\ndata and to use such data to a minimum extent.\n\n**_8\\. Are there any rules on what employers are allowed to do concerning\nsubjecting employees to medical examinations or health-related tests that\nwould apply to an emergency situation involving a communicable illness such as\nCOVID-19?_**\n\nDuring a phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea reportedly was testing\nover 20,000 people per day. Given the government's focus on testing as a\nmeasure to curb the spread of the virus, employers' measures to subject\nemployees to temperature testing during this outbreak likely would be\npermitted under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Infectious\nDisease Control and Prevention Act. Employers should work with counsel to\nimplement a testing program that still safeguards employees' rights.\n\n### SAFETY & HEALTH RULES\n\n**_9\\. Are non-healthcare employees required to wear respirators or other\npersonal protective equipment?_**\n\nThere is not yet an express provision in the Occupational Safety and Health\nAct or other relevant statutes that generally requires an employer to have\nnon-healthcare employees wear masks, although such a requirement might be\nimposed in certain limited areas/industries (e.g., daycare centers, nursing\ncenters, prisons, military facilities, etc.).\n\n**_10\\. Can an employer with a public-facing business, prevent employees from\nwearing a surgical mask or respirator?_**\n\nKorean law does not address this point in general (except for limited areas\nsuch as daycare centers, nursing centers, prisons, etc.), so an employer could\ntechnically prohibit employees from wearing surgical masks or respirators.\nBut, wearing such masks is common in South Korea, and could be considered a\nvalid social distancing measure to help protect an employee's health.\nTherefore, it would be prudent to allow employees to wear masks.\n\n**_11\\. What if an employee requests to wear some type of mask as an\naccommodation?_**\n\nIt would be prudent and common to allow it in Korea, although there is no\nexpress statutory requirement to allow it as an accommodation.\n\n**_12\\. For employers that have events for large gatherings scheduled, should\nthey cancel them?_**\n\nThe South Korean government has in general urged cancellation of mass\ngatherings. It is generally prudent to cancel large gatherings, though such a\ndecision could lead to contract disputes with vendors or suppliers.\n\n### IMMIGRATION\n\n**_13\\. Has your country 's government issued travel advisories? (If so,\nplease summarize the guidance and provide a link to the government's website\n(if applicable))._**\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Health and Welfare provide\n[information on the countries](http://www.0404.go.kr/dev/newest_list.mofa)\nthat have limitations for entering South Korea. This generally includes anyone\nflying from the Hubei province in China, those who have visited the province\nand are returning to Korea, and Japanese nationals who do not hold a visa\nissued after March 9, 2020\\.\n\nAdditionally, as of March 19, 2020, all people (including South Koreans)\nentering Korea must go through special entry procedures that include a\nscreening process to check for COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n**_14\\. An employee who recently traveled to an affected area (in another\ncountry) is having difficulty re-entering your country:_**\n\n**_(a) How can an employer help the employee get back into your country?_**\n\nIt would be wise to communicate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to secure\nsupport for the employees' return.\n\n**_(b) In the case of a foreign employee, will the government 's travel\nadvisories affect an employer's ability to get the foreign employee back into\nthe country? (Discuss if there are visa-related issues)_**\n\nThis is a fast-developing area, so travelers should check the advisories\nbefore and during any travel. As noted, effective March 9, 2020, Japanese\nnationals were required to secure a visa to enter Korea, though previously\nJapan was part of a no-visa entry program.\n\n### UNEMPLOYMENT & OCCUPATIONAL RISK LIABILITY\n\n**_15\\. Do employer-instituted quarantines or temporary shutdowns or mass\nlayoffs entitle workers to unemployment benefits or severance?_**\n\nGenerally, an employer will be required to pay a business suspension allowance\nof at least 70% of \"the average wage\" if the employer, on its own initiative,\ntemporarily suspends business. However, if the business suspension was done to\nprevent the spread of the disease, then an employer may not have to pay\nallowances (though MOEL strongly recommends doing so). The standard of whether\nany allowance must be paid depends on whether such a suspension could be\nattributable to the employer and is a very fact-specific question.\n\nThe government plans to provide subsidies based on individual daily wage (up\nto KRW 130,000 per day) to employers that grant paid leave to employees who\nare quarantined, and the offices of the National Pension Service have been\naccepting applications from employers since February 17, 2020.\n\nIf an employer receives subsidies from the government for paid leave pursuant\nto the above process, the employer is required to provide paid leave, and if\nthe daily wage of the employee at issue exceeds KRW 130,000, the employer is\nrequired to pay the difference.\n\n**_16\\. What are an employer 's workers' compensation obligations if an\nemployee traveled to an affected area for work and contracted COVID-19?_**\n\nIf the employee becomes ill as a result of work travel, the employee would\ngenerally be entitled to paid leave for the work-related illness or injury.\n\nIf an employee violates the recommendations of the government agency or the\nemployer and travels to an affected area, it is unlikely that an employee\nwould be able to demand any wages in this situation. One may use paid annual\nleave during the 14 days of quarantine, otherwise it would be unlikely that an\nemployee would be able to claim any part of the wages (although one can\nrequest to work from home if there is such a system and be eligible for the\nwages).\n\n### WORKS COUNCIL/INDUSTRIAL UNIONS\n\n**_17\\. In the event of a government-declared quarantine or state of\nemergency, does your country 's law override contractual provisions and allow\nfor actions that might contradict a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)?_**\n\nAs a matter of general law, any mandatory statutory provision supersedes the\nCBA or rules of employment.\n\n### PRIVACY\n\n**_18\\. According to your government 's health department, what are the steps\nthat employees should follow to notify the authorities that they suspect or\nare confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection?_**\n\nThe MOEL guideline issued on February 24, 2020, urges the public to promptly\nreport to the center of the disease control and obtain necessary guidance.\nClick\n[here](http://www.moel.go.kr/local/andong/news/notice/noticeView.do;jsessionid=mJyN1SqD6kD2FRmHKMet2zFRtP1DfogWV9faAJM4a5OmqSdk4yfcny8d7iMIpSfc.moel_was_outside_servlet_wwwlocal?bbs_seq=20200300301)\nfor the relevant page on MOEL's website providing information on how to report\nsuch cases.\n\n**_19\\. Can an employer require employees to self-report having a COVID-19\ninfection?_**\n\nUnder the relevant statute (Personal Information Protection Act), it would be\nsafe to obtain the consent of the employee to disclose the information\nregarding the infection. (There is a stronger degree of protection when the\nemployee is reporting their own health condition). There is a general\nexception to privacy law restrictions when the matter concerns the public\nhealth and safety, but it is much-debated whether such an exception can be\napplied in the given situation, so care should be taken.\n\n**_20\\. If one of our employees is quarantined, what information can we share\nwith our employees? Who can we share it with?_**\n\nAn employer may only share the minimum amount of information needed in\nsecuring the general health and safety of other employees. Sharing information\nwhere the infected personnel visited, and the date when it occurred, would\nlikely be permissible (though some degree of privacy concerns remain).\nHowever, an employer must not include name or other information that would\nidentify the infected personnel.\n\n**_21\\. What privacy concerns do we need to be aware of when we are asking for\nthe health information of our employees in order to evaluate whether they need\nto be quarantined?_**\n\nAs discussed above, information about a COVID-19 infection is sensitive\ninformation that requires an employee's consent to be processed. Though the\ngeneral exception regarding public safety and health can provide an exception,\nthe scope of application of such exception is unclear. An employer will need\nto exercise care in this regard.\n\nAs this is a fluid and rapidly changing situation, please keep in mind that\ndifferent or additional facts may warrant re-assessment of policies and\npractices so they can serve the best interest of employees, employers and the\ncommunity at large.\n\n_*_ _Tae Eun Lee is an Associate at Yulchon LLC in Seoul._\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

This measure, which is a part of the COVID-19 Economic\nResponse Plan, would support businesses that are hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\n\"We are helping businesses keep their staff on payroll so that businesses will\nbe better positioned to rebound when the current challenges have passed,\" says\nBill Morneau, minister of finance. \"We will continue to do whatever it takes\nto ensure that workers and businesses are supported through the outbreak, and\nthat our economy remains resilient during these difficult times.\"\n\nThe Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would apply at a rate of 75 per cent of the\nfirst $58,700 normally earned by employees, representing a benefit of up to\n$847 per week from March 15 to June 6, 2020. It will be available for three\nmonths, retroactive to March 15.\n\nThe funding is available for all private employers whose gross revenues\ndropped by at least 30 per cent in March, April or May this year compared to\nthe same months in 2019. Eligibility will be based entirely on the salary or\nwages actually paid to employees. All employers would be expected to at least\nmake best efforts to top up salaries to 100 per cent of the maximum wages\ncovered.\n\nOrganizations that do not qualify for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy,\nmeanwhile, may continue to qualify for the previously announced wage subsidy\nof 10 per cent of remuneration paid from March 18 to June 20, up to a maximum\nof $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer.\n\n**Emergency response benefit**  \nThe government has also launched the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB),\nwhich will provide Canadian workers who have lost their income because of\nCOVID-19 $2,000 per month for up to four months.\n\nThose covered by the benefit are:\n\n  * workers who must stop working due to COVID-19 and do not have access to paid leave or other income support\n  * workers who lost their employment, as well as workers who are sick, quarantined or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19\n  * working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children that are sick or need additional care because of school and daycare closures\n  * workers who still have their employment but are not being paid because there is currently not sufficient work and their employer has asked them not to come to work.\n\nThe application period will start on April 6. Direct deposit payments will be\ndelivered into accounts within three business days of applicants being\neligible to receive it, and cheques within 10 days, says the government.\n\n\"No one should have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage, or\nsupporting their families,\" says Carla Qualtrogu, minister of employment,\nworkforce development and disability inclusion. \"The design of the CERB is\nbeing kept as simple as possible to make it quick and easy to access for all\nCanadian workers.\"\n\n[Nearly half (44 per cent) of Canadians say that they or someone in their\nhousehold have lost hours due to the economic\ndownturn](https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-areas/compensation-and-\nbenefits/nearly-half-of-canadian-households-have-lost-work-due-to-\ncovid-19-survey/327971), according to a study from the Angus Reid Institute.\n\nMeanwhile, [18 per cent of employers have eliminated or reduced seasonal\nworkers and 16 per cent have reduced the use of contract workers or other non-\nemployee populations](https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-areas/compensation-and-\nbenefits/almost-one-fifth-of-employers-planning-or-making-workforce-\nreductions-amid-pandemic/328181), according to Willis Towers Watson.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [Quebec offers incentives to low-income, essential services workers](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/quebec-offers-incentives-to-low-income-essential-services-workers/328429)\n  * [1 in 5 employers rewarding front-line workers amid pandemic: survey](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/1-in-5-employers-rewarding-front-line-workers-amid-pandemic-survey/328347)\n  * [Half of small employers in U.S. can't afford payroll for month of lockdown](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/half-of-small-employers-in-u.s.-cant-afford-payroll-for-month-of-lockdown/328343)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

Ensuring the right technology is in place is key to the success of\nthis \"new normal.\"_\n\n_Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-essential personnel have been asked to work\nfrom home, creating a new remote workforce that most companies weren't\nprepared for. And employees who are suddenly working from home -- often in\nchallenging circumstances and without the right technology -- are likely to\nface social isolation and experience a drop in productivity._\n\n![Brian\nKropp](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/kropp_brian.jpg)Brian Kropp\n\n_In this Q &A, Brian Kropp, __chief of research for Gartner HR, discusses how\nto ensure the success of this newly remote workforce by turning to new\nprocesses and using workplace communication tools._\n\n**What are some of HR's most pressing challenges in dealing with the COVID-19\npandemic?**\n\nBrian Kropp: We've worked through a couple of different phases during this\ntime period. The first phase was protecting people's health and safety; get\npeople out of the office and get them home. The second big thing is making\nsure people know how to work in a remote environment.\n\nA lot of companies are really focusing on new communication strategies and\ntrying to be really innovative about helping employees understand what's going\non. And what we're finding is that they just can't send out more emails or put\nmore stuff on company sites. People are overwhelmed by all that and not even\nlooking at it anymore.\n\nSo [HR needs to] come up with interesting ways to [communicate to\nemployees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-tips-for-HR-\nEmployee-communications-during-coronavirus-outbreak).\n\n**How should HR and IT work together to facilitate remote work productivity?\n**\n\nKropp: There are a lot of interactions between HR and IT, especially early on,\nto understand the technology that employees have. The initial set of questions\nare really around assessment of basic capabilities.\n\nSo much has moved so fast, and [companies] feel like they have to buy all new\nsoftware applications and technologies to actually be productive. HR and IT\nhave to work incredibly closely at this point to make sure that the technology\ninvestment decisions, in terms of [enabling remote\nwork](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/4-ways-to-implement-HR-\nsupport-for-remote-employees) and monitoring employees, is actually able to be\nused in the industry in the right way.\n\nThere's a lot of companies that are trying to sell products to IT executives\n[that] can track and monitor employees that are working remote.\n\nBut if IT and HR aren't working through how to [implement that\ntechnology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252479594/As-remote-\nwork-tools-deploy-next-task-is-behavioral), [and they] don't manage\ncommunication in the workforce correctly about that technology, you run the\nrisk of spending a lot of money on it, alienating your workforce and not\ngetting any benefits.\n\n**How should HR be working with managers to help newly-remote employees beat\nisolation and stay productive?**\n\nKropp: One of the important things that companies can do [to really engage\nemployees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-response-to-\nCOVID-19-can-kill-or-boost-employee-experience) at this point in time is to\nfocus on recognition. There's a lot of employees who feel like they're working\nreally hard, but the manager doesn't realize it anymore. During periods of\nstress and disruption, the action of recognizing employees matters a lot. That\nis one of the most important things that you can do to help them become re-\nengaged and be as productive as possible.\n\n**How can workplace communication tools boost productivity and engagement?**\n\nKropp: [Many] employees who work from home report feeling more socially\nisolated and feel like they've got fewer social connections. By [promoting the\nuse of] certain communication tools -- and not just for work, but for\nfriendship -- is a really important way to help drive employee engagement.\nEmployees just started naturally using [workplace communication tools] for\nsocial things since [newly-remote employees] aren't getting the chance to get\na cup of coffee with someone or go grab lunch.\n\nSo [HR and IT] can really trying to think about interesting ways from a\ncommunication perspective to try and build a social connection.\n\nThese workplace communication tools help employees actually do the work. It\ncan create a social connection and give employers a better sense of what's\nactually going on with those employees and how they're feeling.\n\n**What specific workplace communication tools can help coworkers and teams\nconnect when they are feeling isolated?**\n\nKropp: Companies have been using communication tools like Slack and Teams and\nthose have largely become the communication channels of choice for most\norganizations.\n\n**Are these tools enough to keep employees productive?**\n\nKnopp: The problem is a lot of these online tools are really designed for\ncommunication, not work.

Satter**](/author/profile/Marlene-Satter/) | April 06, 2020 at\n04:44 PM\n\n________[__](http://www.almreprints.com \"ALM Reprints\")\n\nX\n\n## Share with Email\n\nSend\n\nsending now...\n\n## Thank

Shutterstock)\n\nEmployers will need to \u201cwin with empathy\u201d as the uncertainty wrought by the\n[coronavirus ](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/03/10-questions-employers-\nhave-about-covid-19/)pandemic and its aftermath not only change how people\nwork now, but will work in the\n[future](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/06/how-the-pandemic-will-impact-\nthe-trump-backed-lawsuit-against-the-affordable-care-act-412-96109/). That\u2019s\naccording to a Mercer [study](http://www.mercer.com), 2020 Global Talent\nTrends.\n\nIt  points out that the accelerating changes in the workplace forced by the\ncoronavirus are causing\n[employers](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/06/covid-19-and-the-workforce-\nemployers-must-take-a-long-range-view/) to focus on employee health and\nfinancial wellness, and on providing training for future workforce disruptions\nsuch as AI. They have plenty of good reasons to focus more on employees,\naccording to the study, including the fact that 34 percent of employees expect\ntheir jobs to be replaced in three years. In addition, only a little more than\nhalf\u201455 percent\u2014trust their organization to reskill them if their job changes\nas a result of automation.\n\nBut even though 85 percent of executives agree that the organization\u2019s purpose\nshould extend beyond shareholder primacy, says the report, only 35 percent of\ncompanies actually do that now. As employers themselves have to transform to\nmanage such changes, the report says that they also need to reconsider their\ncompany\u2019s purpose and their responsibilities to employees and employees\u2019\nfuture earnings.\n\nIn addition, workers have to be supported to be able to grow and shape a\nsustainable business\u2014something 68 percent of executives say they want to do.\nAnd there are plenty of other gaps\u2014not supporting older employees, failing the\n63 percent of workers who say they\u2019re at risk of burning out, not providing\nfinancial education for employees (just 23 percent of companies do this,\nalthough 78 percent of employees want long-term financial planning).\n\nThe road ahead won\u2019t be easy for workers, with 63 percent of HR leaders\npredicting stagnant wage growth\u2014something that won\u2019t go over well with\nemployees. And there\u2019s a probability that the global economy could weigh on\nany changes they may intend to impose on their workforce.\n\n\u201cBalancing economics and empathy in all people decisions is important, even\nmore so now as we face questions, concerns and the uncertainty of a global\npandemic,\u201d Ilya Bonic, president, career and head of strategy at Mercer, is\nquoted saying.\n\nBonic adds, \u201cOrganizations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset\nthat enables them to prepare for and invest in the future. This rethinking of\npurpose and priorities is vital across the organization, but especially for\nHR. The findings from this year\u2019s study make it clear that transformation of\nthe HR function is a key component to creating a sustainable organization.\u201d\n\n_**READ MORE:**_\n\n  * **[Coronavirus guts pension funding levels](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-guts-pension-funding-levels/)**\n  * **[Small businesses already showing effects of COVID-19 on hiring](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/02/small-businesses-already-showing-effects-of-covid-19-on-hiring/)**\n  * **[How to help your clients understand the CARES Act: Paycheck Protection Program](https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/03/31/how-to-help-your-clients-understand-the-cares-act-paycheck-protection-program/)**\n\n__share on facebook __share on twitter\n\n## Marlene Satter\n\n[ ]( /author/profile/Marlene-Satter/)\n\nMarlene Y.

[Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nIf you've been hearing more about wellbeing of late - you may be on to\nsomething. In fact, it has appeared in the list of the top four priorities of\nabout 100 Singapore employers when it comes to their employee benefits\nstrategies from now till 2022.\n\nIn specific, these priorities, as provided in Willis Towers Watson's [latest\n_2019/2020 Benefit Trends Survey_](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-\nsg/Insights/2019/10/the-evolution-of-benefits-in-asia-pacific-from-\ntransactional-to-transformational), include:\n\n  * A focus on aligning their benefits provisions with both the market norms and their employees' needs and wants (69%);\n  * Incorporating wellbeing into the organisation's overall benefit strategy (62%);\n  * Enhancing work policies (57%); and\n  * Incorporating diversity and inclusion into their benefits programmes (56%).\n\nIn line with the above, the survey found that employers in Singapore are now\nexpanding their focus to address emotional, financial and social wellbeing,\napart from simply focusing on physical wellbeing.\n\nThese initiatives include identifying and managing behavioural health, stress\nand issues to maintain stability of mind and body of employees across the\nworkforce; implementing solutions to improve the financial health of the\nworkforce; and introducing ways to promote a sense of involvement around\nhealth and financial issues.\n\nAt the same time, two in five employers are also looking to add or enhance\nchronic disease management and mental health programmes in their\norganisations.\n\nThese priorities come on the back of three primary challenges that employers\nsee on the horizon (over the next three years).\n\nFirstly, a majority foresee rising benefit costs as a key challenge (73%).\n\nFurther, nearly seven in 10 (66%) cited the differing needs and wants of a\nmulti-generational workforce, while just under half (46%) expect to see a lack\nof employee engagement with their benefits programmes.\n\n![Priya-Nov-2019-WTW-benefits-cost-survey-provided-\nscreengrab-2](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/04112723/Priya-Nov-2019-WTW-benefits-cost-survey-\nprovided-screengrab-2.jpg)\n\n\n\nElaborating on this, **Cedric Luah, Managing Director, Head of Health &\nBenefits for Asia and Australasia, Willis Towers Watson**, noted on the\ndiffering expectations that the five generations comprising the workforce\ntoday have, and how they would like to receive or consume their benefits.\n\nThus, he said this calls for a flexible approach to benefit strategies that\nreflects the needs of all employees, maximises inclusivity and engagement,\nwhile ensuring the employee population feels valued.\n\n\"While controlling costs remains their top challenge, employers are\nincreasingly focused on a broader benefit strategy that goes beyond their core\nhealth and retirement offerings.\n\n\"In addition to the traditional emphasis on plan design and cost management,\ncompanies are now looking for ways to better connect with employees to meet\nthe benefit needs of a diverse workforce and get the most value for their\nbenefit spend.\"\n\nGoing forward, **Audrey Tan, Head of Health & Benefits for Singapore, Willis\nTowers Watson**, commented on all of these factors presenting a challenge for\nemployers when modernising their benefits, as they need to create a portfolio\nof benefits that is relevant across a variety of employee groups and ages,\nflexible yet strong enough to be a significant attraction and retention factor\nfor employees.\n\nShe added: \"Highly effective organisations should incorporate a more holistic\ncommunication strategy as part of their benefits review. This will ensure that\nthe value of benefits is being brought across more effectively to employees. \"\n\n### _Bonus snapshot: Key priorities in selected APAC countries_\n\n![Priya-Nov-2019-WTW-benefits-cost-survey-provided-screengrab-\nlead](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/04112339/Priya-Nov-2019-WTW-benefits-cost-survey-\nprovided-screengrab-lead.jpg)\n\n\n\n**About the _2019/2020 Benefit Trends Survey_**  \nThe survey was conducted in May and June 2019.

[Jim Probasco](https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/53825/)\n\nUpdated Mar 27, 2020\n\nWith passage and signing of the [CARES\nAct](https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-\nsecurity-cares-act-4800707) into law, Congress and President Trump have set\ninto motion a massive $2.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill and the largest\nsingle economic rescue plan in the history of the U.S.\n\nAt this point, you likely wonder how much of this and previous coronavirus\nlegislation applies to you and your financial well-being. It turns out these\nlaws impact you in a big way.\n\n##  Phases I, II, and III\n\nThere are three parts to COVID-19 legislation so far, Phases I, II, and III.\n\nPhase I, H.R. 6074, known as the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response\nSupplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, was enacted into law March 6, 2020 and\nprovides $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to ensure\nvaccines developed to fight the coronavirus are affordable, that impacted\nsmall businesses can qualify for Small Business Administration\n([SBA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-business-\nadministration.asp)) [Economic Injury Disaster Loans\n(EIDLs)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-\nfinance/091514/expanding-your-small-business-sba-loan.asp), and that Medicare\nrecipients can consult with their providers by telephone or teleconference, if\nnecessary or desired.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPhase II, H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, became law\nMarch 18, 2020. This $100 billion package includes provisions for paid sick\nleave, free coronavirus testing, expanded food assistance, additional\nunemployment benefits, and requirements that employers provide additional\nprotection for healthcare workers.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPhase III, H.R. 758 (116), the CARES Act, signed into law March 27, 2020,\nrepresents the[ largest stimulus bill in the history of the U.S. at $2.2\ntrillion](https://www.investopedia.com/what-s-in-the-usd2-trillion-\ncoronavirus-stimulus-bill-4800882). The legislation provides direct payments\nto individual taxpayers and their dependents, a huge expansion to unemployment\nbenefits, including the self-employed, student loan forbearance, and much\nmore.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * Coronavirus legislation affects your wealth as well as your health.\n  * Legislation falls into three parts - Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III.\n  * These new laws cover everything from the cost of vaccine to small business loans to direct payments to U.S. citizens and more.\n  * Experts as well as members of Congress say more will eventually be needed. Keep checking for updates.\n\n##  Impact on Your Financial Life\n\nTo help you better understand how COVID-19 legislation affects your financial\nwell-being, the list that follows includes provisions that may apply to your\nsituation. Expect the list to change in the days and weeks to come as new\nideas become law. In other words, check back. Here are the key points, tied to\nthe laws they're part of.\n\n##  Free Vaccines (Phase I and III)\n\n(I) H.R. 6074, now Public Law 116-123, provides that \u201cvaccines, therapeutics,\nand diagnostics\u201d funded by this law will be \u201caffordable.\u201d While the definition\nof \u201caffordable\u201d is unclear, there is a commitment on the part of government to\nensure no price gouging when it comes to coronavirus treatment.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) The CARES Act further declares that access to testing and any future\nvaccine will be available \"without cost-sharing.\" In other words, the vaccine\nand testing to find out if you have the coronavirus are free.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Small Business Relief (Phases I and III)\n\n(I) Phase I law establishes a $20,000,000 \u201cDisaster Loans Program Account\u201d to\nprovide money to small business owners in the form of low-cost [SBA\nloans](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-\nfinance/091514/expanding-your-small-business-sba-loan.asp) to help overcome\nthe economic impact of COVID-19 on their business. Needless to say, this\naffects employees as well, since a closed business has no employees.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III offers $349 billion to provide tax credits to small businesses\nand allows them to defer paying payroll taxes so they can continue paying\nemployees. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees can receive a \u201cSmall\nBusiness Interruption Loan\u201d so long as they continue to pay workers. The loan\ncan be used to cover 100% of six weeks\u2019 payroll (capped at $1,540 per week per\nemployee). The law calls for the loans to be forgiven if the money is used to\nretain workers or cover basic operational expenses.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Medicare Telehealth Waiver (Phase I)\n\n(I) Another Phase I provision with the somewhat clumsy name \u201cTelehealth\nServices During Certain Emergency Periods Act of 2020\u201d directs Medicare to let\nyou confer with medical professionals by phone, including FaceTime, Skype, and\nother telehealth services, even if you don\u2019t meet the requirement that that\nyou live in a rural area or have some other qualifying condition.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  HSAs Used for Telehealth and OTC Products (Phase III)\n\n(III) The CARES Act provides that HSAs paired with HDHPs can offer pre-\ndeductible coverage for Telehealth and other types of remote services. The Act\nalso extends the use of HSAs to non-prescription over the counter (OTC)\nmedicines and certain menstrual care products.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Paid Sick Leave (Phase II)\n\n(II) H.R. 6201, known as the \u201cFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d\nmandates that your employer provide you with two weeks paid sick leave if you\nare isolated due to COVID-19, have been advised to self-quarantine, are\nexperiencing symptoms and seeking medical help, or are caring for someone\nunder quarantine. You get up to 12 weeks' paid leave if you are caring for a\nchild who is home because school is closed or your childcare provider is not\navailable because of coronavirus.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Free Coronavirus Testing (Phase II and III)\n\n(II) Phase II provides free FDA-approved COVID-19 testing for everyone\u2014even\nthose who are uninsured. Testing, without deductibles or copayments, includes\nthe cost of a trip to the doctor or emergency room to get the test. The\nlegislation does not cover additional tests or treatment. That will be up to\nyour current healthcare plan, including Medicare and Medicaid.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III expands on the provisions of Phase II to include testing\nprovided by labs on an emergency basis, state-developed tests, and any other\ntests authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Expanded Food Assistance (Phase II)\n\n(II) If you have food security issues\u2014something more likely to be the cas as\nmore and more people lose jobs due to workplace shutdowns\u2014Phase II offers\nhelp. This includes almost a billion dollars for the Special Supplemental\nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC).\ufeff\ufeff There's\nalso $400 million for emergency food assistance, help for those with children\neligible for free or reduced price school lunches whose school is closed, and\nemergency SNAP benefits including temporary suspension of the SNAP three-month\ntime limit on funding adults under 50 with no children.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III provides $450 million for the Emergency Food Assistance\nProgram, to supply food banks and provide operational assistance. An\nadditional $200 million will go to food assistance for Puerto Rico and other\nU.S. territories plus $100 million for food distribution at American Indian\nreservations. Nearly $16 billion will be added to the Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program (SNAP) and another $8.8 billion made available to Child\nNutrition Programs.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Protections for Healthcare Workers (Phase II)\n\n(II) If you are a healthcare worker, Phase II protects your medical and\nfinancial stability by requiring the [Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occupational-\nsafety-and-health-act.asp) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS)\nwithin 30 days that requires healthcare sector employers\u2014or other employers\ndesignated to be at elevated risk,\u2014\u201cto develop and implement a comprehensive\ninfectious disease exposure control plan to protect health care workers from\nexposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID19.\u201d In addition, OSHA must\nissue a permanent health and safety standard six months after the ETS has been\nissued.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Expanded Unemployment Benefits (Phase II and III)\n\n(II) Phase II provides nearly $1 billion in additional funding to states to be\nused to process and pay unemployment insurance. Assistance is also available\nto provide additional payments for those who have exhausted their benefits.\nCheck with your local unemployment office for details in your state.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III provides an unprecedented boost in [unemployment\nbenefits](https://www.investopedia.com/federal-pandemic-unemployment-\ncompensation-fpuc-definition-4802039) including $600 per week per worker for\nfour months on top of state benefits. The stimulus package includes an\nadditional [13 weeks of extended\nbenefits](https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-emergency-unemployment-\ncompensation-peuc-definition-4802046), paid for by the federal government. The\nlist of workers who qualify for unemployment benefits expands to include\n[independent contractors, the self-employed, and gig economy\nworkers](https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-unemployment-assistance-pua-\ndefinition-4802064).For specifics check with your local unemployment office.\n\n###  $1,200\n\nThe amount to be sent to each adult with income of $75,000 or less.\n\n##  Direct Payments to Families (Phase III)\n\n(III) The latest legislation directs the U.S. Treasury to send most U.S.\nadults a check (or direct deposit) of $1,200 ($2,400 for couples filing\njointly). Each child age 16 and under will receive an additional $500.\nIndividuals with adjusted gross income (based on 2018 or 2019 tax returns) of\n$75,000 ($150,000 for couples filing jointly/$112,500 for head of household)\nor less will get the full amount. Your direct payment will be reduced five\ncents ($0.05) for every dollar you earned the amounts listed above until it\nhits zero at $99,000. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated most people\nwill get their payment within three weeks.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Suspension of Student Loan Payments (III)\n\n(III) The Department of Education will automatically suspend payments on\nDirect student loans without penalty through Sep. 30, 2020. Check with your\nloan servicer to make sure your payments have been suspended. You will receive\nmultiple notices after Aug. 1 letting you know about the end of the payment\nsuspension program.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Wages and Benefits for Airline Workers (III)\n\n(III) Included in the Phase III package is $32 billion in grants to cover\nwages and benefits for workers employed by passenger airlines, cargo airlines,\nand contractors. Companies that accept these funds and other assistance in the\nform of loans or loan guarantees are barred from making furloughs, pay cuts,\nstock buybacks, or issuing dividends to investors through Sep. 2020.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Public Health Fund (III)\n\n(III) The law creates a $100 billion public health and social emergency fund\ndesigned to reimburse providers for expenses and lost revenues during the\ncrisis. Most of the funds will go to hospitals with the rest earmarked for\ndoctors, nurses, suppliers, and others.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Protection Against Foreclosure and Eviction (III)\n\n(III) Phase III codifies protections for homeowners against foreclosure and\nrenters against eviction. If you are experiencing financial hardship due to\nthe coronavirus, you will be granted forbearance on your federally backed\nmortgage loan for up to 60 days, with the potential for up to four 30-day\nextensions. Foreclosures may not begin for 60 days from Mar. 18, 2020.\n\nNo fees, penalties, or added interest may be charged on delayed payments. If\nyou are a landlord with a mortgage on a multifamily home you have similar\nprotection that allows a 30-day forbearance on payments and up to two 30-day\nextensions.\n\nIf you are a renter in a multifamily home with a federally backed mortgage\nloan, you may not be evicted solely for failure to pay rent for a 6 months.\nYou also may not be charged fees or penalties for not paying rent.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Special Rules for Retirement Funds (III)\n\n(III) The CARES Act effectively waives the 10% tax penalty for early\nwithdrawals from retirement funds if those withdrawals are related to the\ncornonavirus. The waiver is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2020. Also, you are not\nsubject to a[ required minimum\ndistribution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/02/121002.asp)\n(RMD) from your retirement account in 2020.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Guarantee Money Market Mutual Funds (III)\n\n(III) If you are an investor, Section 4015 of the CARES Act that temporarily\nsuspends the restrictions of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008\nmight be of interest. The legislation permits the temporary use of the\n[Exchange Stabilization\nFund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangestabilizationfund.asp) to\nguarantee money market mutual funds. The guarantee will terminate December 31,\n2020. \ufeff\ufeff\n\n###  Article Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.\nThese include white papers, government data, original reporting, and\ninterviews with industry experts.

you had a knee-jerk reaction to a surprise? Maybe you\nwere startled (in a good way) when a friend you hadn\u2019t seen recently walked in\nthe door unannounced. Perhaps you were less pleasantly jolted by water gushing\nfrom a ceiling leak or a snake that had camouflaged itself to mimic a tree\nroot you were stepping over on a trail.\n\nThe world is experiencing a collective knee-jerk reaction as effects of the\ncoronavirus spread through society, drastically affecting businesses and\ndriving people into their homes to try to stay safe.\n\n## What will happen to the employees?\n\nMany manufacturers have temporarily closed or are changing production.\nRestaurants, hospitality providers and retail stores are [facing tough\ntimes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/20/us-industries-being-\ndevastated-by-the-coronavirus-travel-hotels-food/111431804/). The risk of\n[mass bankruptcies](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-just-doubled-the-risk-\nof-mass-bankruptcies-123827521.html) could double.\n\nDespite the dizzying contractions taking place in the business world, the\ncoronavirus will eventually be brought under control. People will need to eat;\nroads, offices and buildings will need to be constructed; appliances and\nautomobiles will need to be made.\n\nHaving a knee-jerk reaction to the coronavirus now will only hurt business\noutcomes in the long run. It\u2019s not the easiest time to think long-term about\ncompensation and benefits, but it\u2019s necessary to force yourself to look beyond\nthe immediate crisis toward a total rewards strategy.\n\n## Wage and benefit continuity matter\n\nTalk of the pandemic is unavoidable these days, but it\u2019s important to\nrecognize where your employees\u2019 biggest fears lie, says [Amanda\nWethington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandawethington/) of Korn Ferry.\n\nAn [Emerson College/Nexstar poll](http://emersonpolling.com/2020/03/19/march-\nnational-poll-70-of-americans-worried-about-catching-coronavirus/) found that\n42% of Americans surveyed were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about personal finances,\ncompared to 26% about personal health. Combine that with the fact that 60% of\nthe working population has less than $1,000 in savings, and it\u2019s clear that\nreward systems are an issue that existed before coronavirus descended (and one\nthat will be around long after).\n\n**Existing challenges to wage continuity**\n\nSome challenges to wage continuity predate the coronavirus pandemic, such as:\n\n  * 70% of US hourly workers don\u2019t have sick leave\n  * Staffing shortages and absenteeism issues\n  * The gaps created by gig economy pay arrangements\n  * Poor communication and decision-making in some businesses \n\nHere are some actions being taken given the disruption of the coronavirus:\n\n  * Sick leave policies are being reviewed and reassessed\n  * Shift policies are being reconsidered, as are compensation rates for hourly workers\n  * Processes and equipment allocations are under review, especially for positions where remote work is not an option, such as health care\n  * Catastrophe pay is being mulled\n  * Supplemental payments and benefit continuation arrangements are becoming more of an option\n\n## Different industries face different reward system hurdles and opportunities\n\n[Mark Quinn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-quinn-8853396/) of Korn Ferry\nnotes that reward systems considerations faced by human resources vary by\nindustry.\n\nManufacturing must lead from the top regarding pay reductions, Quinn notes,\nand be timely about entering into negotiations with unions.\n\nThe service industry, on the other hand, should make employee safety a primary\nfocus. The industry should also seek to structure temporary layoffs, taking\nadvantage of any state support that is available. This industry is also\nuniquely positioned to take advantage of hiring increases as organizations\nsuch as [CVS, Amazon and Tesco](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/hiring-\ncompanies-seek-thousands-employees-amid-coronavirus-\npandemic/story?id=69767851) seek to meet heavy demand.\n\nFinancial services can implement staff rotations and defer salary increases\nand bonus payments. This sector should also provide mental health support (as\nshould all sectors).\n\nFor health care, which has shouldered the brunt of this crisis, the front line\nworkers have to be supported, says Quinn. The public and private sectors\nshould unite to ensure services can be provided. The sector must pare down\noperationally to the priority at hand, putting aside nonemergency business\nmatters.\n\n## Regardless of the industry, some common principles apply\n\nEach industry has its own difficulties to navigate, but communicating well can\nfortify an organization to get through the problems brought on by this\npandemic. Following a four-part framework can turn \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d into a\ncalmer, more methodical plan, says Wethington.\n\nFirst, make the immediate changes that will provide support to the continuity\nof labor while also addressing the realities of such an abrupt shift. It\u2019s\ntempting to immediately resort to across-the-board salary or job cuts. This is\nnot always avoidable, but it is smart to consider other options that are less\ndamaging to employee morale and less likely to make the business look panicky.\n\u201cLook at your reward strategy and involve the team of leaders to determine the\nwhat, the why and the how of labor cost management programs,\u201d she recommends.\n\nSecond, develop a \u201cmulti-pronged approach\u201d to managing labor costs. Layoffs\nare the traditional choice, says Wethington, but there are multiple other\noptions. These include reducing hours, unpaid leaves/sabbaticals, reducing\nreliance on contractors, doing away with overtime, delaying bonuses or\nsuspending benefits such as retirement savings.\n\nThird, weigh the effects of your cost management choice against the risk to\nemployee relations, \u201cnot just to the employees being affected, but to the\norganization as a whole.\u201d\n\nFinally, incorporate care and empathy when applying whatever reward change you\nmake.\n\n## Communication always matters\n\nThis is a time that calls for gut-wrenching decisions on the part of leaders.\nEven when you have to deliver bad news, keep employee well-being at the\nforefront, says Don Lowman of Korn Ferry. Take a balanced perspective, because\nthere will be a turnaround, he says. This pandemic will pass, and when it\ndoes, the effects of your discipline in avoiding a knee-jerk reaction will\nshow.\n\nFinally, lead by example. [John\nMurdock](https://www.smartbrief.com/branded/77F8DA5B-9982-431B-9E20-444163A3CF79/D027BAE8-D557-4A3C-9FB7-F7F679C28753)\nbecame the CEO of Centage virtually overnight when his predecessor (and dear\nfriend) passed away. He was coping with the expectations of employees who were\nshocked and grieving at a time when he was too. \u201cEven though on any given day\nI have a million things to attend to, I make time to walk the floor, talk to\npeople and generally let people know I\u2019m available. It\u2019s disingenuous to state\nyou want a collaborative and transparent environment but then have no time to\nconnect with people,\u201d says Murdock.\n\nThis is a difficult time for almost every business. It\u2019s tempting to leave\nquestions about reward systems for calmer moments. Take the time now to\naddress them, and you\u2019ll find your post-pandemic world much more rewarding.\n\n(Concepts in this post are adapted from \"[Employing Agile Reward Strategies\nfor a Volatile\nWorld](https://infokf.kornferry.com/REG_WBR-2020-03-24-Coronavirus-Webinar-\nSeries-5_CHALL_GBL_GL_Other_MoFu_On-demand-Employing-agile-reward-\nstrategies.html?utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=20-03-covid),\"\na Korn Ferry webinar.)\n\n_Paula Kiger edits SmartBrief's nonprofit sector newsletters and co-\nmanages[@SBLeaders](https://twitter.com/SBLeaders) on Twitter.

This\nSeptember, the national unemployment rate fell to\n[3.5%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianweller/2019/10/08/even-amid-low-\nunemployment-many-workers-still-struggle-finding-a-job/#6d8327fa4de2), the\nlowest it\u2019s been in 50 years.\n\nTo [attract and\nkeep](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/21/three-keys-\nto-attracting-and-retaining-top-talent/#429c8d95be22) top talent on board,\nemployers are building out their benefits offerings. Although perks like paid\ntime off remain popular, business leaders are also turning to new-age HR\nbenefits to help them stand out.\n\n![Want to bring new talent to your team? You may need to shake up your\nbenefits package.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc03af9b4d505000678d7d2/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nWant to bring new talent to your team? You may need to shake up your benefits\npackage.\n\nGetty\n\n## **Why HR Benefits?**\n\nEmployee benefits cost money. So why do employers offer them rather than boost\nworkers\u2019 pay? Because giving workers a break in certain areas also benefits\nthe company:\n\n  * Health insurance ensures workers can get the care they need, which makes them more productive.\n  * Disability insurance gives them peace of mind when tackling dangerous tasks. \n  * Sick days keep workers from bringing their bugs to the office. \n\nHR benefits also help employers differentiate themselves. Does a $39,000\nsalary really stand out when competitors are offering $36,000? No, but a\n$36,000 salary with fully funded health insurance might. Ensuring employees\nknow they\u2019ll be cared for if they get sick makes more of a splash than padding\ntheir paychecks.  \n\n## **Which HR Benefits Do Workers Want?**\n\nNap pods and free haircuts might sound fun, but they don\u2019t bring workers in\nthe door. These HR benefits do:\n\nToday In: [Entrepreneurs](https://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs)\n\n  * [\n\n### Meet Patricia Bright: Social Media Maven And Founder Of The Break Platform\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommywilliams1/2020/04/08/meet-patricia-bright-\nsocial-media-maven-and-founder-of-the-break-platform/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Bangladesh\u2019s New Generation Of Women-Led Labor Unions Confronts The\nPandemic\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2020/04/07/bangladeshs-new-generation-\nof-women-led-labor-unions-confronts-the-pandemic/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Coffee With A Black Guy: This Social Entrepreneur Is Keeping His Community\nTalking, Despite Social Distancing\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2020/04/07/coffee-with-a-black-\nguy-this-social-entrepreneur-is-keeping-his-community-talking-despite-social-\ndistancing/)\n\n###  **1\\. Health Insurance**\n\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance may be getting tougher to find, but it\nremains one of the most popular HR benefits. Medical emergencies and chronic\nconditions can easily wipe out workers\u2019 savings. In fact, [two-\nthirds](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/this-is-the-real-reason-most-\namericans-file-for-bankruptcy.html) of bankruptcies trace back to medical\nexpenses.\n\nWhat if your company can\u2019t afford to pay premiums for the entire team and\ntheir families? Rather than pass on this employee benefit altogether, find\nways to cut costs. High-deductible health plans can reduce premiums by\nhundreds of dollars per month. Wellness challenges with small prizes can\nencourage workers to practice healthier habits.\n\n### **2\\. Remote Work**\n\nIn the digital age, most office work can be done from anywhere. For solo jobs,\nsuch as writing and coding, HR perks like remote work can actually make people\nmore productive.\n\nAs enterprises like [IBM and Aetna](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-\nnews/why-are-big-companies-calling-their-remote-workers-back-office-n787101)\nend their remote work programs, build out yours to create a competitive\nadvantage. Talented workers want the flexibility to choose their own work\nenvironment. Remote work makes it easy to stay home with a sick kid or meet a\ncontractor for household repairs.\n\nIf you add remote work to your HR benefits, trust your team. They know the\nspaces where they\u2019re most productive. Set core hours to facilitate\ncollaboration, but allow employees to otherwise choose when and where they\nwork. Use tools like Slack to help everyone stay in touch.\n\n### **3\\. Healthcare Payment**\n\nEven if you provide health insurance to your employees, healthcare isn\u2019t free.\nDeductibles commonly top $1,000, and\n[40%](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-\nfinances/index.html) of Americans don\u2019t have the funds to cover a $400\nemergency expense.\n\nSooner or later, everyone gets sick. When that happens, some workers face a\nhard choice: Go to the doctor at an unknown cost or delay care and hope they\nget better. With an extended illness or financial stress, their productivity\nplummets.\n\nSo workers don\u2019t need to make a devil\u2019s choice, employers are offering\ndeductible credit though firms like [Paytient](https://www.paytient.co). In\naddition to healthcare expenses, employees can use this HR benefit to pay for\nveterinary, dental, and vision expenses. Those expenses are then payroll\ndeducted at 0% interest, according to the payment terms each employee selects.\n\n### **4\\. Retirement Savings Plans**\n\nPensions are all but gone from the private sector. Still, top talent expects\nemployers to offer some sort of retirement savings plan.\n\nProvide HR benefits like 401(k) plans to help workers [prepare for\nretirement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcarlson/2019/09/29/how-the-curse-\nof-the-average-leads-to-failed-retirement-plans/#11f9e6744ac3). Match a\npercentage of the funds to encourage them to contribute. At a minimum, match\ncontributions up to 3% of workers\u2019 pay; if you can afford it, scale your match\nto 10% or more.\n\nOne low-cost way to enhance this employee benefit? Let employees customize\ntheir portfolios. Veteran employees who are just a few years from retirement\nwon\u2019t want to invest if their only options are high-risk. Most younger workers\nprefer more aggressive investments, given that market downturns even out over\nthe long haul.\n\n### **5\\. Tuition Reimbursement**\n\nTalented employees are lifelong learners. Encourage them to build their\nprofessional skills and explore relevant interests with HR benefits like\ntuition reimbursement.\n\nTuition reimbursement isn\u2019t just for employers popular with young people,\neither. [Bank of America, BP, and\nAnthem](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/companies-offer-tuition-\nreimbursement-4126637) all chip in thousands of dollars per year for workers\nwho want to go back to school. Those employees then bring back new knowledge\nto share with the team. Educational HR benefits pay for themselves.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to set boundaries if you add this to your list of HR benefits.\nRequire that employees receiving the perk maintain a certain GPA. Ensure the\nschools they select are accredited. Limit the program to courses of study that\nactually benefit the business. You may even want to ask employees to stay on\nfor a certain amount of time after completing their coursework so you absorb\nmore of the talent benefit.\n\nTalented workers know they have options, especially when unemployment is so\nlow. Rather than worry about paying more than the competition, beat them in a\nway that boosts productivity and morale: with standout HR benefits.\n\nCheck out my [website](http://www.naacp.org/).\n\n[![Serenity Gibbons](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/serenitygibbons/files/2018/05/Serenity-\nGibbons_avatar_1525181923-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/\n\"Photo of Serenity Gibbons\")\n\n[Serenity Gibbons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/)\n\nSerenity Gibbons is a former assistant editor at The Wall Street Journal.

Faragher](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/jofaragher/ \"Posts\nby Jo Faragher\") on 6 Apr 2020 in\n[Furlough](https://www.personneltoday.com/employment-law/furlough/),\n[Coronavirus](https://www.personneltoday.com/wellbeing/coronavirus/),\n[Information & consultation](https://www.personneltoday.com/employee-\nrelations/information-consultation/), [Latest\nNews](https://www.personneltoday.com/ct/latest-news/),

have been forced to close at least temporarily due to\ncoronavirus\n\n**This weekend, the government updated its guidance on the Coronavirus Job\nRetention Scheme or furlough. How will the scheme work in practice?**\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most commonly used words in our expanding coronavirus lexicon,\nbut perhaps also one of the more confusing. Furlough, the term used to\ndescribe the government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, now attracts more\nthan 23 million results in a Google search and makes a daily appearance in the\nbusiness headlines.\n\n## Coronavirus employment issues\n\n**[Webinar: Coronavirus- measures to protect your business\n](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/podcasts-and-webinars/webinar-coronavirus-\nmeasures-to-protect-your-\nbusiness/165062/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[How to consider alternatives to redundancy during the coronavirus\ncrisis](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/how-to/how-to-consider-alternatives-to-\nredundancy-during-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis/165030/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nThis weekend (4 April), the government announced [updated\nguidance](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-employers-may-re-employ-\nstaff-who-left-after-28-february/) to the scheme, clarifying that\norganisations can re-employ people who were made redundant after 28 February\n2020 so they will be eligible to receive 80% of their former salary. This also\nmeans that those who left to start a new job after this date can ask their\nprevious employer to re-employ them so they can qualify for furlough support.\n\nBut despite some clarification, many employers remain confused about how the\nscheme will work in practice \u2013 from the situations in which furlough is\nappropriate to how the money will be reclaimed from HMRC. Below we outline\nsome of the key elements of the scheme and what is known so far:\n\n## What is the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?\n\n[Announced on 20 March](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/chancellor-\nannounces-massive-wage-support-plan-to-counter-coronavirus-damage/) by\nchancellor Rishi Sunak, the scheme offers a grant from HMRC to cover 80% of\nsalaries, up to \u00a32,500 a month. The scheme is scheduled to last for three\nmonths backdated from 1 March 2020, but may well be extended.\n\nSunak said the grants would be available from 1 April, and the scheme aims to\nensure that businesses impacted by the virus can furlough employees with\nfinancial support from the government rather than making redundancies.\nFurlough must be for a minimum of three weeks.\n\nThere is nothing to stop employers \u201ctopping up\u201d the difference between the\namount they are reimbursed by the government and full salary, but this will\nnot be funded through this scheme.\n\nThe online service employers can use to claim furlough is not ready yet, but\nthe government estimates this will be up and running by the end of April.\n\n## Who has used it so far?\n\n[Thousands of staff have been placed on\nfurlough](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-coronavirus-british-\nairways-marks-spencer-disney-and-more/) since the scheme was announced:\nBritish Airways announced it would furlough 80% of its staff (equivalent to\naround 36,000 employees) last week, while construction company Sir Robert\nMcAlpine said it was preparing to do the same with around 50% of staff. Among\nthe latest employers to announce it would be using the scheme is [newspaper\npublisher Reach](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/mirror-and-express-owner-\nto-furlough-thousands-of-staff/).\n\nDiane Gilhooley, global head of employment, labour and pensions at law firm\nEversheds Sutherland, has described the amended scheme as more like an \u201cincome\nprotection scheme\u201d rather than something to avoid redundancy, as its remit\nseems to be widening.\n\n## What if someone left after 28 February?\n\n\u201cThe initial guidance on the scheme suggested that only employees made\nredundant since 28 February 2020 could be re-engaged by the employer and put\non furlough,\u201d explains Charles Wynn-Evans, a partner at law firm Dechert. \u201cOn\nthis basis the scheme would not cover those who had resigned in the normal\ncourse \u2013 who of course could not be furloughed for the purposes of the scheme\nby their new employer as they would not have been on the new employer\u2019s PAYE\npayroll as at 28 February 2020.\u201d\n\nThe updated guidance from the government means that workers can be re-engaged\nand put on furlough even if they had not been made redundant, provided that\nthey were still on PAYE on 28 February.\n\n## Can someone still work while on furlough?\n\nIf someone has more than one employer, they can be furloughed separately by\neach one. This also means that they can continue to work for another employer\nand receive usual wages if they have been furloughed by a different employer.\n\nEmployees can also sign up to volunteer while on furlough, as long as the\norganisation they\u2019re working with does not generate revenue for that business.\n\n## What about employees who have caring responsibilities or who are sick or\n\u2018shielding\u2019?\n\nAnyone who needs to stay at home because they are following public health\nguidance to self-isolate can still be furloughed if they are unable to work\nfrom home and \u201cwould otherwise have been made redundant\u201d, says Wynn-Evans. The\nsame applies for employees who cannot work because they have caring\nresponsibilities (as children are no longer attending school and nurseries\nhave closed).\n\nEmployees who are receiving sick pay while self-isolating cannot be\nfurloughed, but can be furloughed once their isolation period is over,\naccording to government guidance.\n\n## Does there need to be a consultation process?\n\nEmma Ahmed, a professional support lawyer at Hill Dickinson, says that because\nmost UK employment contracts will not contain provisions where an employer can\nforce an employee to take a period of furlough leave, placing an employee on\nfurlough will generally involve a temporary change of contract. If the\norganisation intends to pay less than full pay (ie 80% from the government\ngrant and a top up from its own payroll), it\u2019s recommended to get express\nagreement for the change.\n\nShe advises: \u201cEmployers should make sure any process followed is fair and\ninvolves consultation with employees; furlough leave should not be\nunilaterally imposed without consent.\u201d Where a trade union is recognised, she\nadds, it should be consulted about the proposals.\n\nJulian Cox, head of employment at iLaw, agrees that employees\u2019 agreement must\nbe sought as it involves a change in employment status. However, whether the\ntypical collective consultation arrangements apply is unclear. He adds: \u201cThe\nguidance says that this process may be bound by the usual rules of collective\nconsultation, which require an employer to consult with their team if more\nthan 20 workers are affected,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the language used in the government guidance is far too\nambiguous and it is leaving some employers uncertain of their\nresponsibilities, which prevents them from taking the action they need.\nCompanies want to take action on this now, but if they do not undergo the\nnecessary process for consultation they may risk being found in breach of the\nregulations at a later date.\u201d\n\n## Which aspects of pay are covered?\n\n\u201cWhat is and what is not going to be paid must be made clear at the time that\nfurlough is offered to staff so that there is clear consent as to the terms of\nfurlough and to avoid arguments about deductions from wages at a later date,\u201d\nadvises Linky Trott, head of employment at Edwin Coe. Employers can claim (up\nto the \u00a32,500 cap) salary, past overtime where it is compulsory or \u201cforms part\nof usual remuneration\u201d, and compulsory commission payments, she says.\n\n## Furlough latest\n\n**[Research: Furlough is curtailing job\nlosses](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-coronavirus-job-losses-\nxperthr/)**\n\n**[Treasury urged to look again at coronavirus scheme\nloophole](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/treasury-looks-again-at-\ncoronavirus-scheme-loophole/)**\n\nNot included are discretionary bonuses, tips, commission payments and benefits\nin kind such as company cars or health insurance. \u201cFees\u201d have also been\nexcluded from the scope of the scheme, although the government does not\nprovide detail on what this term means. Furthermore, while many employers will\nchoose to top up the 80% government grant to full salary, this is not\ncompulsory. Ahmed adds: \u201cIt may also be possible to justify [topping up] for\nonly part of your workforce, such as critical workers, but care should be\ntaken to ensure selective top-ups are not discriminatory.\u201d\n\n## What if an employee refuses to go on furlough?\n\nAcas\u2019s advice if an employer cannot reach an agreement on furlough is that\nthey may consider changing the written terms in employees\u2019 contracts. \u201cIf\nthere are more than 20 employees affected, employers will need to consult\nstaff representatives (\u2018collectively consult\u2019),\u201d the conciliation service\nsays.\n\nAhmed at Hill Dickinson explains: \u201cIf more than 20 employees are involved, and\na dismissal and re-engagement process might be followed if voluntary consent\nto the change is not forthcoming (to force the change through without\nagreement), then the employer will have a duty to inform and consult\nappropriate representatives (which may require an election to select\nrepresentatives).\u201d Because time is of the essence at the moment, it would be\nreasonable to shorten the typical consultation period of 30 or 45 days.\n\n## What about non-employees such as agency workers?\n\nIf agency workers are paid through PAYE, furlough arrangements should be\nagreed with the agency, who is the \u201cdeemed employer\u201d. The updated guidance\nsays that agency workers should not perform any work through that agency\n(including for other clients) while they are on furlough.\n\nWorkers operating through umbrella companies should contact their umbrella\ncompany for further guidance. The Freelance & Contractor Services Association\nis lobbying for the government to treat contractors who operate through\numbrellas as \u201cemployees whose pay varies\u201d (the same way as agency workers are\ncategorised).\n\nThe government has now also clarified that those with the legal employment\nstatus of \u201cworker\u201d rather than employee are eligible for furlough support.\nThis does not include self-employed independent contractors, who are instead\nable to apply for the chancellor\u2019s self-employment support package.\n\nCompany directors can take furlough and continue to undertake their statutory\nduties \u201cprovided they do no more than this would reasonably be judged\nnecessary for that purpose\u201d, according to the updated guidance.\n\n## What about annual leave?\n\n[According to Acas](https://www.acas.org.uk/coronavirus/using-holiday), if an\nemployee is furloughed, they can still request to take their holiday in the\nusual way. For those who are still working, the government recently announced\nthat they could carry over up to four weeks\u2019 paid holiday over a two-year\nperiod, providing they were not able to take holiday due to the coronavirus\n(they were sick, on furlough or had to continue working as they were a key\nworker).\n\nWhen it comes to holiday that has already been booked by employees on\nfurlough, the guidance is less clear, according to Simon deMaid at law firm\nHowes Percival. He says: \u201cThe current government guidance on the scheme states\nemployee rights are not affected by being on furlough leave, suggesting\nholiday entitlement would continue to accrue as normal. However, the guidance\nis silent on whether holiday can be taken during a period of furlough leave\nand if so, what rate of pay the employee is entitled to receive while on\nholiday: their normal salary or the 80% furloughed rate.\u201d\n\nWith Easter coming up this weekend, employers may well be wondering about how\n[bank holiday](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/bank-holidays-five-things-\nemployers-need-to-know/) pay arrangements will apply. Acas says that employees\nmay still be required to use a day\u2019s paid holiday if they are on furlough over\nthe bank holiday. Those who are still employed, meanwhile, should get their\nusual pay for bank holidays.\n\n## Can we rotate furlough?\n\nThe updated guidance confirms that employees can be rotated on and off\nfurlough, for example for a period of annual leave, to help employers avoid an\naccumulation of untaken leave. Wynn-Evans at Dechert says: \u201cIt is now clear\nthat furloughing can be rotated across a group of employees.\n\n\u201cThe updated guidance confirms that employees must return to work at the end\nof a furlough period and can be furloughed multiple times provided that each\nperiod of furlough is for a minimum period of three consecutive weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that furloughing can be rotated across a group of employees.\u201d\n- Charles Wynn-Evans, Dechert\n\n## What about apprentices?\n\nApprentices are eligible for furlough in the same way as other employees. The\nupdated guidance says that employers \u201cmust pay apprentices at least the\nApprenticeship Minimum Wage, National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage as\nappropriate for all the time they spend training\u201d.\n\nThis means employers must cover any shortfall between the amount they can\nclaim for their wages through this scheme and the appropriate minimum wage.\n\n## What is still unclear?\n\nAs with any legislation or policy put together in such fast-changing\ncircumstances, it is likely that some finer details remain unclear. Employment\nlawyers have pointed to the following remaining questions:\n\n  * HMRC is yet to clarify what happens to staff that have been transferred to another business under TUPE after 28 February 2020. Can a new employer claim for reimbursement under the scheme for an employee who was furloughed at point of transfer?\n  * It is not clear what happens to someone who becomes ill while on furlough (particularly if this is before the required three-week minimum): do they come off furlough and apply for sick leave?\n  * What happens if employers decide to wait and see if they really need to place staff on furlough? Cox at iLaw argues that the legislation needs to be clearer on when the scheme can start and end. He says: \u201cBusinesses may wish to keep this scheme in reserve as a last option, but the rules are clear, the [scheme] is only currently open for three months, starting from 1 March. This may mean that those who wait may be penalised for trying to continue on as usual, while those businesses that decide to furlough earlier could be better off. This area of guidance could do with clarification and possible amendment to make it fairer for all.\u201d\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/work-and-time-pressures-\nleave-occupational-health-professionals-exhausted-and-undervalued/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/apprentices-furlough-\ncontinue-learning/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Furlough: what the updated guidance clarifies, and what it\ndoesn\u2019t_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f4625e9cb64877c05513a341fd46bf60?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAndy 6 Apr 2020 at 10:53 pm [#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-\nupdated-guidance-cjrs/#comment-88827 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nCan employees be put on a Furlough with a deferred redundancy?

to win the employees' trust amid the pandemic**_\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent uncertainty are accelerating changes in\nthe ways organizations around the world are working and will continue to work\ninto the future. Particularly in challenging times, leading employers are\nfocusing on their workforce, specifically fostering healthy lifestyles,\nsupporting financial wellness, and providing skills and training as careers\nchange due to AI and technology developments. The reasoning is clear:\nAccording to [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com/)\u2019s _2020 Global Talent Trends_\nstudy, 34% of employees expect their jobs to be replaced in three years, 61%\nof employees believe their employers are preparing them for the future of work\nand 55% trust their organization to reskill them if their job changes as a\nresult of automation. As employers transform to tackle these matters, they\nshould reconsider their company\u2019s purpose and their responsibilities to\nemployees and employees\u2019 future earnings, since 63% of HR leaders predict\nstagnant wage growth. And, they need to do so while facing unforeseen\nchallenges like COVID-19 and a likely economic softening that could impact the\nadoption of new workforce strategies.\n\n**HR News:**[Espressive Raises $30 Million Series B to Gain AI-Leadership in\nEnterprise Service Management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/ai-in-\nhr/espressive-raises-30-million-series-b-to-gain-aileadership-in-enterprise-\nservice-management/)\n\n\u201cBalancing economics and empathy in all people's decisions is important, even\nmore so now as we face questions, concerns and the uncertainty of a global\npandemic. Organizations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset\nthat enables them to prepare for and invest in the future,\u201d said Ilya Bonic,\nPresident, Career, and Head of Strategy at\n[Mercer](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/mercer-\nintroduces-mercer-digital/). \u201cThis rethinking of purpose and priorities is\nvital across the organization, but especially for HR. The findings from this\nyear\u2019s study make it clear that the transformation of the HR function is a key\ncomponent to creating a sustainable organization.\u201d\n\n### **Mercer\u2019s study identifies four trends for 2020:**\n\n  \n**Focus on Futures:** Work together to ensure people thrive now and in the\nfuture. With a new mandate for business, 85% of executives agree that the\norganization\u2019s purpose should extend beyond shareholder primacy, yet only 35%\nof companies deliver on this today. Meanwhile, one in three employees says\nthey would prefer to work for an employer that shows responsibility towards\nall stakeholders, beyond just shareholders and investors. Furthermore, much of\nan organization\u2019s success depends on whether it can support its talent to grow\nand shape a sustainable business. This is on the executive agenda \u2013 with 68%\nwanting to focus more on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.\nWhile 61% of employees trust their employer to prepare them for the future of\nwork, 63% feel at risk of burnout. Career pipelines have tightened as 72% of\nexperienced workers say they plan to work past retirement age, and 55% of Gen\nXers say opportunities to advance are limited because of longevity in the\nworkplace. Better management of older workers is part of creating shared\nvalue. More than three-quarters (78%) of employees want long-term financial\nplanning, yet just 23% of companies say they provide financial education for\nemployees today. \u201cEach organizational stakeholder has a crutch. For HR it\u2019s\ntechnology, for employees it\u2019s trust, and for the C-Suite it\u2019s HR. When those\ncrutches are strong it\u2019s amplifying; when they\u2019re weak it jeopardizes the\nability of all stakeholders to create sustainable futures,\u201d said Kate Bravery,\nPartner and Advisory Solutions & Insight Leader at Mercer.\n\nIn most regions, employees\u2019 most valued career support is personal and\nprofessional growth opportunities (73%). This is the same for the US (78%),\nfollowed by the company has a good sense of employees\u2019 current skills,\ninterests and skill gaps (73%). \u201cTo attract and retain talent, companies need\nto offer and deliver futures with ample and equitable opportunities to grow\nand develop, health and retirement savings strategies that make a difference\nin their physical and financial wellness, and a climate of trust born out of\ncollective responsibility for shared futures,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n\n**Race to Reskill:** Transform the workforce by reskilling for a new world\neconomy. Reskilling is the talent investment most capable of driving business\nsuccess, and 99% of all organizations are embarking on transformation and\nreport significant skill gaps. Workforce capability and lack of future skills\nwere the top reason transformations failed. Although 78% of employees say they\nare ready to learn new skills, 38% claim they do not have enough time for\ntraining. Moreover, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in workforce learning\nand reskilling as part of their strategy to prepare for the future of work and\n40% do not know what skills their workforce has today. \u201cTransformation is not\na question of whether to adopt, but about how best to adapt. To stay ahead,\norganizations need to reskill at scale, with speed, and across all generations\nin their workforce,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n\nAcross regions, employees say innovation will be the top in-demand skill in\nthe next 12 months. HR leaders in the US agree with their employees. Moreover,\nin the US, this in-demand skill is followed by digital marketing and customer\nexperience for HR leaders and complex problem solving and advanced\ninterpersonal/relationship skills for employees.\n\n**Sense with Science:** See ahead by augmenting AI with human intuition.\nAdvances in machine learning continue to permeate across industries and ways\nof life: Use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years (from\n10% in 2016 to 39% today). Yet, only 43% of organizations use metrics to\nidentify employees likely to leave, 41% know when critical talent is likely to\nretire, 18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance, 15% can\ndetermine if it is better to buy/build/borrow employees and 12% are using\nanalytics to correct inequities and prevent them recurring. Other forms of\nemployee engagement data gathering are on the rise too; 62% of companies are\nusing pulse surveys today, and 33% plan to invest in this in 2020. While\nmachines outperform humans at tasks related to scale and speed, humans outpace\nmachines at sense-checking and judgment, which are critical elements of\nethical decision-making. Yet while 67% of HR leaders are confident they can\nensure AI is not institutionalizing bias, ethics codes about the collection,\napplication, and implications of people analytics are still in their infancy.\nTalent assessment is equally an area in which human intuition is needed along\nwith the digital assessments \u2013 today only one in two employees (52%) had a\npositive assessment experience and found it useful. \u201cCompanies know more today\nabout human behavior and cognition than ever before. How they gather and act\non this information demands a greater focus on moral and equitable ethics,\u201d\nsaid Ms. Bravery.\n\nAcross regions, disconnects exist between the analytics the C-suite\nprioritizes and those HR leaders provide. In the US, 62% of HR leaders provide\nanalytics on the C-suite\u2019s top priority as to what are key drivers of\nengagement in the organization. Yet, only 40% are providing analytics for how\ndifferent retirement options impact older workers' behavior, which is also a\ntop priority of the C-suite.\n\n**Energize the Experience:** Inspire and invigorate people by redesigning\ntheir work experience. Delivering on the employee experience is HR\u2019s top\npriority, and 58% of organizations are redesigning to become more people-\ncentric. Yet, only 27% of executives believe employee experience will yield a\nbusiness return. And, even though 61% of employees trust their employer to\nlook after their well-being and 48% of executives rank it as a top workforce\nconcern, only 29% of HR leaders have a health and well-being strategy. This is\nnot an area to be missed as employees whose company is focused on employee\nhealth and well-being are four times more likely to be energized. Energized\nemployees are essential to realizing organizations\u2019 transformation agenda:\nthey are more likely to stay, more resilient, and more ready to reskill. HR\ntransformation is high on organizations\u2019 agenda and delivering on the employee\nexperience requires HR to step out of its functional silos, yet only 40% of HR\nleaders say they have an integrated people strategy. \u201cInteractions with\nemployees matter and all interactions from progressive care practices to fair\npay to flexible working make up the employee experience,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n_\u201c_ More than twenty years of transforming HR have yielded moderate success.\nCompanies need to upgrade their thinking about what drives people and\nperformance and step away from typical HR models.\u201d\n\nImproving the employee experience tops HR\u2019s future of work priorities in\nEurope, North America, and the Middle East, while Asia and Pacific put\ntransforming talent practices (recruitment, performance management, and\nsuccession) in the top spot. Other priorities for HR in the US include\nmeasuring skills gaps against business objectives, implementing a compelling\ntalent value proposition and developing an integrated people strategy.\n\n**HR News:**[GigSmart's Partners With Stride to Provide Extended Benefits to\nWorkers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/compensation-benefits/gigsmarts-\npartners-with-stride-to-provide-extended-benefits-to-workers-3/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Employers+Focus+on+Health%2C+Financial+Wellbeing+and+Careers+of+the+Employees%2C+Surveys+Mercer\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employers+Focus+on+Health%2C+Financial+Wellbeing+and+Careers+of+the+Employees%2C+Surveys+Mercer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Employers Focus on Health, Financial Wellbeing and\nCareers of the Employees, Surveys\nMercer&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Workplace Wellness ](/category/workplace-wellness/\n\"Workplace Wellness\")\n\n  * [ ![Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your Employees](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/how_to_offer_effective_open_enrollment_benefits_5db1af6eea03b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-enrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your\nEmployees ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-\nenrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nOpen enrollment season is around the corner.

It\u2019s ridiculously intuitive \u2013 no one needs a half-day training to\nstart chatting, and with features like custom emojis and GIFs, it echoes how\nusers communicate in other parts of their lives. It\u2019s easy to understand \u2014 all\nthe information users need is accessible in clear channels that are easy to\nnavigate and keep people coming back everyday, creating stickiness. And\nlastly, it\u2019s available where people use other platforms \u2014 on the web, on their\ndesktop, and on mobile. It\u2019s because it got these basics right that Slack\nbecame what it is today, despite not having a sales team in its early days:\nemployees took the platform from job to job and evangelized about it to their\nnew teams.\n\nNow, think about the usual healthcare benefits platforms, and how employees\nfeel when they first encounter them. The experience is clunky and confusing,\nand it doesn\u2019t help users access the right information to make informed\ndecisions about their health \u2013 the very reason for addressing healthcare\nbenefits in the first place. You won\u2019t find many people who get so excited\nabout their health and wellness platforms that they talk them up to their\ncolleagues or ask HR to deploy them like they did with Slack.\n\nThe fact is, employee healthcare needs its own Slack. According to a recent\n[Harvard Business Review Analytic survey](https://league.com/ca/benefits-\nexperience-hbr-report/), more than half (58%) of organizations report that\nemployees are unaware of the health benefits to which they are entitled, and\njust 28% of respondents say that employees actively engage with all of the\nhealth benefit programs they are offered. In a society where people spend\n[one-third](https://www.gettysburg.edu/news/stories?) of their lives at work,\nand health concerns like obesity and anxiety are on the rise, how do we bridge\nthe engagement gap between health benefits and the people they are meant for?\n\n**Learn more:** **[What Is an Employee Engagement Survey? Definition, Process,\nVendors, and Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)**\n\n## **One solution to rule all health needs**\n\nEmployee engagement with benefits is on every HR manager\u2019s must-have list,\nwhich is why today\u2019s health platforms are all vying for employee eyeballs, on\nan everyday basis. But the reality is that employees often need to log in to\nmultiple platforms to get a simple benefits question answered, making their\nexperience disjointed and cumbersome. The same HBR survey also found that\nnearly 70% of respondents use between three and five benefits systems! To\nreduce employee confusion and integration headaches, HR and benefits managers\nmust create an easy-to-use health benefits experience in a single technology\nsolution \u2013 not a bunch of point solutions that employees need to ramp up on\nand log into daily.\n\nHR is also waking up to the fact that before any of the cosmetic changes on\nthe design, or a flashy mobile app, employees want their benefits to be more\nthan about plans and deductibles. They want a health benefits experience that\naddresses their health holistically \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t mean a 40-page manual\nthat informs you about your co-pay when you go to the dentist.\n\nSo how should companies go about thinking about their health experience? Here\nare some questions they should ask themselves when vetting technology\nsolutions.\n\n**Smart service with a human touch.** Our health is a sensitive, private\nmatter that cannot be left completely up to technology \u2014 the human touch is\ncritical to ensure a safe and comfortable experience for employees while using\na health platform, even if it uses the latest and greatest technologies like\nAI and machine learning. That means high-touch features like live\nconsultations with qualified healthcare professionals who can address a wide\nrange of issues \u2014 from answering questions about deductibles to offering\nadvice on how to manage anxiety.\n\n**Data-fueled personalization.** If employees want a more personalized view of\ntheir health and wellness goals, the players in this market have to marry\nhealth data to recommendations. Employees will become more regular users of\nplatforms that offer suggestions on nutrition, mental health, and quitting bad\nhabits like smoking \u2013 but they must be suggestions that map back to a person\u2019s\nunique health profile, not just generic guides. Additionally, these platforms\nmust have features \u2014 backed by behavioral psychology \u2014 designed to keep users\nmotivated and invested in breaking bad health habits and building new good\nones. That guidance on their overall health is what will keep them coming back\nto use the platform day after day, even when they\u2019re not at work. Which takes\nus to our next point\u2026.\n\n**Accessible everywhere.** In keeping with the experiences that consumers have\nbecome used to within tools like Slack and social media, the high-touch\nservices should be accessible via chat or text (no waiting on hold on the\nphone for a half-hour). Mobile access is, of course, essential for adoption;\nthere\u2019s no faster way to scare employees away from digital health tools if\nthey can only be used on desktops or while in the office. More importantly,\nour health is not just a 9-5 concern, and the tools we use to manage it should\nreflect that.\n\n**Inclusive design.** Increasingly diverse workforces demand that health\nbenefits experiences \u2014 more than any other tools, due to the sensitive nature\nof one\u2019s health information \u2014 welcome everyone. A good example of this is\nensuring a platform offers thoughtful gender options when asking employees to\nsign up, so they not only have a place to be honest about a critical health\nfactor but also so that marginalized gender identities feel included and\nwelcome in the experience, just like their cis colleagues.\n\nTechnology has the power to change how we engage with our healthcare \u2014 and\nmake our workplace, and consequently, our communities much healthier than they\nare today. But to become as much of a daily habit as Slack \u2014 not just be\nsomething we think about during open enrollment \u2014 our health benefits\nexperience needs relevancy along with ease of use. We\u2019re not on Slack all day\nbecause of the emojis (although that helps). We\u2019re there because the\ninformation we get and share from coworkers matters to our day-to-day work\nlife. A health benefits experience that is similarly loved by workers will be\njust as meaningful, personal, and human.\n\n**Learn more:[5 Tips to Communicate Benefits Enrollment with\nEmployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/tips-\nto-communicate-benefits-enrollment-with-employees/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Fwant-better-employee-benefits-engagement-what-hr-can-learn-from-\nslack%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Want+Better+Employee+Benefits+Engagement%3F+What+HR+Can+Learn+from+Slack\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Want+Better+Employee+Benefits+Engagement%3F+What+HR+Can+Learn+from+Slack&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Fwant-better-employee-benefits-engagement-what-hr-can-learn-from-\nslack%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Fwant-better-employee-benefits-engagement-what-hr-can-learn-from-\nslack%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Fwant-better-employee-benefits-engagement-what-hr-can-learn-from-\nslack%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Want Better Employee Benefits Engagement?\nWhat HR Can Learn from\nSlack&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Fwant-better-employee-benefits-engagement-what-hr-can-learn-from-\nslack%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Workplace Wellness ](/category/workplace-wellness/\n\"Workplace Wellness\")\n\n  * [ ![Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your Employees](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/how_to_offer_effective_open_enrollment_benefits_5db1af6eea03b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-enrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your\nEmployees ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-\nenrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nOpen enrollment season is around the corner.

In HR circles, 2019 was a year when\ncompetition and a new generation rose up. Amid the increasingly fierce talent\nwar, shifting demographics and lifestyles prompted employers to offer a richer\nnew menu of benefits types, from pet insurance and identity protection to\ntelemedicine.\n\nBut 2020 will be a year when change kicks up a gear.\n\n## **1\\. Millennials in the boardroom**\n\nPeople still talk about \u201cmillennials\u201d as though they were some still-emergent\nclass. But the group, born roughly between 1981 and 1996, already represents\nthe majority of employees. By 2030, 75% of the workforce is expected to be\nmillennial,[ according](https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/08/the-rise-of-\nthe-millennial-workforce/) to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThat is what has been driving new-wave perks. But, more than merely catering\nfor younger employees, we will now start to see a more profound shift - a\nstrategic change that is led by millennials.\n\nWe are about to see one of the largest generational replacements of the\nexecutive class ever. When millennials are in leadership seats, a new\ngeneration of managers, we will see some very different approaches to\nsolutions and [employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/) \\- approaches that are\nmuch more in-tune with our diverse world and with the pressures and needs of\nmodern lifestyles.\n\n## **2\\. Radical transparency for health costs**\n\nWhen employees need hospital treatment, suddenly they are hit with a shock - a\nsurprise bill for standard procedures whose costs are always known to\nproviders but often hidden in patients\u2019 employer insurance documentation.\n\nNext year, the veil may be lifted. The president instructed federal agencies\nto develop rules that will require disclosure of actual hospital prices in\nconsumer-friendly electronic form. Furthermore, the Lower Health Care Costs\nAct, developed out of a Senate committee during the summer, would outlaw \u201cgag\nclauses\u2019 that forbid insurance providers from revealing those fees, creating a\nnew body to pool nationwide health insurance price data.\n\nLikely to pass in 2020, the new measures will be a big deal. If employers can\nadequately adopt the technology infrastructure that will be required to make\ndisclosure happen, this is going to bring health insurance costs out into the\nsunlight.\n\n## **3\\. Elder-care benefits go mainstream**\n\nAging parents present a new level of anxiety for millennials who have often\nleft their hometowns to make it in the big city. Many larger enterprises have\nalready begun to offer care assistance plans for employees\u2019 parents or respite\ncare for busy, caregiving employees. Now we will begin to see more mid-market\ncompanies follow suit.\n\n## **4\\. Mental health as a benefit**\n\nToday, the benefits of good mental health are pleasingly obvious. In 2020,\nthat will drive more insurance providers to add mental health services to\ntheir list of employer benefits.\n\nSome providers began adding therapy and talking services already this year,\nfinding it to be a big hit. That suggests more widespread availability would\nbe welcomed.\n\nThankfully, more workers than ever are much better in touch with their own\npsychology and are happy to reach out or receive a helping hand to rebalance.\nOffering that hand isn\u2019t just a nice gesture - a happy employee is also a\nproductive one.\n\n**Learn More:[The Hidden Benefits of Cultivating a Strong Culture Through Team\nBuilding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/the-hidden-benefits-\nof-cultivating-a-strong-culture-through-team-building/)**\n\n## **5\\. Regulatory**\n\nThe Affordable Care Act now compels employers with as few as 50 staff to\nprovide minimum coverage and to report to the IRS, whilst COBRA requires those\nwith as few as 20 provide coverage to transitional workers.\n\nThe regulation will continue to force change in entitlements, with tweaks at\nboth federal and state levels. For example, in California, legislation has\nproposed that gig-economy workers like those for Uber and Lyft be considered\nemployees, thereby making them eligible for basic insurance, whilst the[\nEmployer Participation in Repayment Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/1043) would allow employers to reimburse $5,250 against an\nemployee\u2019s student debt each year.\n\nSmart employers need to stay ahead of the legislation, and budget accordingly.\n\n## **6\\. Systems**\n\nTo do so, companies are going to need to get their infrastructure in order.\nFor many of the kinds of changes we will see next year, the systems which run\ninsurance administration, which are now around 20 years old, are just not fit\nfor purpose.\n\nSo, pretty soon, we are going to see a large replacement cycle, as employers\nsearch for newer back-end software designed for the modern workplace, with\nbetter integration, mobile accessibility, instant access to carrier offerings\nand tools that can surface the information new regulation dictates.\n\nWeaning yourself off familiar practices is never easy. But then, those of us\nin HR administration are, by now, also familiar with perpetual change.

Flexible and yet strong enough to be a\nsignificant attraction and retention factor for employees.\n\n\"Highly effective organisations should incorporate a more holistic\ncommunication strategy as part of their benefits review.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nChris Renz\n\nChris Renz is a Partner and Co-Founder at [Nua Group,\nLLC](https://www.nuahr.com/).\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nIn an attempt to entice and keep top talent, organizations are anticipating\nemployees' needs and offering more comprehensive benefits packages and\nperquisites to complement the salary and other financial compensation.\nHowever,  [data shows](http://www.ifebp.org/bookstore/benefits-communication-\nsurvey-results/Pages/benefits-communication-survey-results.aspx) that the\nmajority of employees do not understand their benefits or even read benefit\nmaterials: Up to 80% of companies reported that their employees do not open or\nread benefit materials. But before you open your employee engagement playbook\nto address this issue, take a moment to understand why this is happening.  \n\nInvestigating the main reasons why employees struggle with the benefits plans\ncan help companies redesign their benefits and help employees take advantage\nof the programs that are offered. So why don't employees understand the\nbenefits?\n\n**1\\. Benefits are not top of mind for most employees** **.**\n\nAs human resources professionals, we think about these things every day, while\ntypical employees are focused on their jobs, their family and friends, and\ntheir daily lives. The major benefit plans are insurance programs that are\nused infrequently because they are exactly that: insurance that can protect us\n_in case_  something happens in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to medical benefits, in my observation, an average of 20-40% of\nemployees will have no claims or will use preventive care, keeping them away\nfrom a doctor\u2019s office, and less than 10% of employees will file a disability\nclaim (including maternity leave) in a year.\n\nWith medical plans, most costs and uses are concentrated in a minority of\nindividuals, and these are the people who tend to understand their health\nbenefits very well. Retirement involves a benefit not accessed until a future\ndate that, especially for millennial employees, might feel like an eternity\naway, and therefore is something that they don\u2019t need to even think about at\nthis point.\n\nVacation and paid time off policies (PTO), on the other hand, are the most-\nunderstood employee benefits, and that\u2019s not because they are easy to\nunderstand or they are communicated better. Employees care about paid time\noff, and just about everyone uses some each year.  \n\nOne way to address this issue is to analyze the employee populations and\nadjust benefit communications depending on what matters most to employees.\nThen educate the employees about the programs that might not be priorities for\nthem now but could and should be in the longer term. It\u2019s important to\nremember, however, that even with great educational material, people won\u2019t pay\nattention or remember the details unless the plans are used regularly, so you\nreally need to make a case about why this information is relevant for a\nparticular employee group.  \n\n**2\\. Benefits are complicated.**\n\nMany benefit plans involve complex rules and jargon driven by the IRS code or\ninsurance companies that are confusing and complicated to employees.\n\nFor example, changes to benefit elections or amounts to contribute to a\nflexible spending account (FSA) and health savings account (HSA) are governed\nby the IRS. Benefits professionals and administrators consult with advisors\nand legal counsel to comply with these rules. In the meantime, employees are\nexpected to manage this benefit while having much less understanding of what\napplies to them. The available information can be overwhelming, even for those\nwith the interest and patience to reach through it. No surprise that the\nreaction to comprehensive benefit materials is\n\u201c[TL;DR](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/tldr).\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the benefits you offer, ask yourself these questions: Are you\noffering a true choice, and is there a way for you to make the offer simpler?\nAnd, is the choice easy for employees to make? When it comes to communicating\nthe benefits, is there a way you could explain it in simple terms so that\nanyone could understand it? Simplifying the benefits and communicating the\ncomplex terms in a simple and clear manner are the most efficient ways to\naddress this barrier.\n\n**3\\. Employees are overwhelmed with benefits tools and resources.**\n\nAs companies work with different vendors to deliver employee benefit programs,\nin most cases there is more than one point of contact for employees to get in\ntouch with when they want to use a benefit. Each provider has its own means of\ncontact, a platform to book an appointment or manage their data, and other\nrules and requirements.\n\nFor this very reason, employers are increasingly offering navigation or\nadvocacy services to help employees navigate this process, find the best\nprovider and check whether the provider\u2019s services are covered.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not always realistic to manage to a small panel of benefit vendors,\nemployers can address this challenge by streamlining the employee experience\nand guiding employees toward the right resource in a user-centric manner.\nWhether it\u2019s creating a benefits website, hosting benefit fairs or setting up\nan infobot to answer the frequently asked questions, you can help employees\nnavigate the complicated world of employee benefits.\n\nThe benefits experience is always complicated, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that\nway. Understanding the barriers that prevent employees from using the benefits\nis a crucial first step in adjusting and redesigning employee benefits\nprograms.\n\nBy embracing simplicity by design and streamlining employee experience,\ncompanies can create benefit programs that truly matter to employees, and are\nboth easy to understand and use. As Leonardo Da Vinci is credited with saying,\n\u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u201d It\u2019s time you bring this to your\nemployee benefit experience.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Chris Renz](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/06/chrisrenz1_avatar_1561731815-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/chrisrenz1/\n\"Photo of Chris Renz\")\n\n[Chris\nRenz](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/chrisrenz1/)\n\nChris Renz is a Partner and Co-Founder at [Nua Group,\nLLC](https://www.nuahr.com/).\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Chris Renz&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Only Half Of Employees Understand Their Benefits.

Mayer](https://hrexecutive.com/author/kathryn-mayer/ \"Posts by\nKathryn Mayer\") | October 29, 2019 \u2022 4 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/536.png)\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference. She has covered benefits for the better part of a\ndecade, and her stories have won multiple awards, including a Jesse H. Neal\nAward and honors from the American Society of Business Publication Editors and\nthe National Federation of Press Women. She holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s\ndegrees from the University of Denver. She can be reached at kmayer@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-columnists/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/columnists/) |\n[Healthcare](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/healthcare/)\n|\n[Wellness](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/wellness/)\n| [Work/Family](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/work-\nfamily/)\n\nI\u2019ve been covering employee benefits for the better part of a decade, but I\nhave to say that things have never seemed more interesting than they do right\nnow. A decade ago, we were in the midst of the Great Recession, and generous\nperks weren\u2019t necessary as employers had their pick of candidates. Now, in an\nemployee-driven market, there\u2019s a slew of interesting and new benefit\nofferings (and thank goodness, because it makes my job more interesting!).\n\nA host of employers have made additions to their benefits packages this\nyear\u2014from boosting paid parental-leave programs and other family-friendly\nperks to rolling out student-loan benefits. As we approach the end of the\nyear, now is a good time to reflect on some of the biggest benefit trends of\nthe year\u2014and see how those might continue to shape the industry in 2020.\n\n**Popular today:[McDonald\u2019s names interim to replace departed\nCHRO](https://hrexecutive.com/mcdonalds-chro-leaves-in-the-wake-of-ceo-\nouster/)**\n\n**Financial wellness.** Employers turning to financial programs and\ninitiatives to help employees achieve financial security is finally hitting\nthe big time. In fact, more than twice as many companies offer workplace\nfinancial-wellness programs to employees today compared to four years ago,\naccording to [recent research from Bank of\nAmerica](https://hrexecutive.com/employers-are-doubling-down-on-financial-\nwellness-is-it-helping/). Just over half of employers (53%) now offer\nprograms, compared to 24% that did so in 2015, according to the company\u2019s\nreport, which is based on a nationwide survey of 800 employers and 1,000\nemployees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nIt\u2019s an important and encouraging step, especially as we hear more depressing\nstatistics (like that 40% of Americans would struggle to come up with even\n$400 to pay for an unexpected bill, according to the Federal Reserve) and\nemployers witness the toll that [financial\nstress](https://hrexecutive.com/employees-are-stressed-about-finances-heres-\nhow-employers-can-help/) is having on their employees\u2019 personal and\nprofessional lives. Employers that can help their employees with this, through\nautomatic savings programs, budgeting tools and other money-management\nefforts, are not only making a wise impact on their employees, but for\nthemselves as well.\n\n**Paid parental leave.** Scores of companies this year\u2014among them, the [J.M.\nSmucker Company](https://hrexecutive.com/smuckers-sweetens-leave-benefits-for-\nemployees/), Hilton, _[The Washington Post](https://hrexecutive.com/the-\nwashington-post-to-offer-20-weeks-of-paid-parental-leave/)_ and Hannaford\nSupermarkets\u2014have boosted or rolled out paid parental-leave programs for\nemployees, especially as a hot job market makes it more imperative than ever.\nWhy is this important? Because the U.S. is the only developed country that\ndoes not mandate paid maternity leave, leaving it up to employers to make\nmeaningful changes for employees. Without paid parental leave, employees often\nuse unpaid time off to take care of a new child, and many struggle with the\ndecision to return to their employer.\n\nDespite an increase in the percentage of employers offering paid time-off\npolicies for new parents, still only 27% do, according to the Society for\nHuman Resource Management, showing a lot opportunity for other companies to\nfollow suit.\n\n**More personalization and digitalization.** You can\u2019t talk to many HR experts\nwithout hearing the term \u201cemployee experience.\u201d And that certainly applies to\nbenefits. A growing number of employers are tailoring voluntary benefits and\nhealthcare options to their employees as individuals. Generations are taken\ninto account, as are preferences on how benefits information is delivered.\nIt\u2019s a way to engage employees and make sure they are getting the most\nvaluable benefits that fit their needs. And technology\u2014in the form of apps,\nenrollment sites and so on\u2014is helping deliver these personalized options.\n\n**Student-loan assistance.** This is still a relatively new and rare perk, but\nit\u2019s one that saw enough movement in the past year to make it noticeable.\nEmployees are drowning in student debt to the tune of $1.5 trillion, according\nto the Federal Reserve, and smart employers are realizing it\u2019s in their best\ninterest to help. The percentage of employers offering a student-debt benefit\ndoubled in the past year, jumping to 4% from 8%, according to SHRM. Employers\nincluding Sotheby\u2019s,[ the Hartford](https://hrexecutive.com/the-hartford-to-\nadd-student-loan-benefit-adding-to-growing-trend/) and [Montefiore St. Luke\u2019s\nCornwall](https://hrexecutive.com/how-one-employer-is-getting-creative-to-\nreduce-student-debt/) started offering student-debt-repayment assistance this\nyear. Others, including Fiat Chrysler, rolled out a student-loan-refinancing\nbenefit that allows employees to replace existing loans with a new loan at a\nlower interest rate. Student-loan benefits have been one of the hottest trends\nof the year, but there is lots of room for growth.\n\n**Employers taking healthcare into their own hands.** Perhaps one of the most\nimportant trends of the last year has been employers taking charge of\nhealthcare. No shock here, but healthcare costs are growing each year\u2014annual\nfamily premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance [grew 5% to average\n$20,576 this year](https://hrexecutive.com/employer-sponsored-healthcare-\ncosts-top-20k-a-year/), according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2014and have\nreached unsustainable levels. As a result, more employers are stepping up to\naddress the problem, realizing that employees who are dealing with stress over\nthe high cost of care are likely to be less productive at work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nFrom virtual care and tech solutions to centers of excellence and direct\ncontracting, the opportunities are endless for employers trying to cut costs\nfor their organizations and for their employees. It\u2019s a smart and needed move.\nEmployers are in the power position to lead the charge and to come up with\nstrategies that not only help lower healthcare costs, but also reinvigorate\ntheir workforce.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about all these trends is there\u2019s room for\ngrowth for each. And of course, there are plenty of other perks ready to take\nthe spotlight in the coming year. I can\u2019t wait to see what will happen next.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fkathryn-\nmayer-top-5-benefit-trends-of-2019%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kathryn+Mayer%3A+Top+5+benefit+trends+of+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fkathryn-\nmayer-top-5-benefit-trends-of-2019%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fkathryn-\nmayer-top-5-benefit-trends-of-2019%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

[Staffers\nclaim](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820228854/former-staffers-sue-bloomberg-\ncampaign-alleging-they-were-promised-pay-through-n) he **** promised to offer\npay and full benefits until November, regardless of whether he was the\nnominee. But a few days later, on March 9, [_Bloomberg campaign staff across\nthe country were laid\noff_](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/09/bloomberg-aides-fired-\nyear-124741). Two weeks later, on March 20, he changed his plans again,\nannouncing he'd transfer rented offices [_to the Democratic National\nCommittee_](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-\ndnc.html) and state Democratic parties, which would then hire their own staff\nusing money from Bloomberg. In total, [_1,500 staffers in battleground\nstates_](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-\ndnc.html) were laid off as the country sank deeper into the coronavirus\ncrisis.  \n\nOne email sent to staffers, which ELLE.com has seen, offered no reason for the\nlayoffs. One section said, \"As a token of our appreciation, we are offering\nyou the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone.\"\n\nFormer campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told ELLE.com in an emailed statement:\n\"Hundreds of former Bloomberg campaign staff have been contacted and are in\nthe hiring pipeline to join the DNC organizing efforts, which would not have\nhappened without this campaign's transfer of funds. This process is moving\nquickly, but until that process is complete, we have also created a fund to\nensure that all staff, whether in process with the DNC or those who opted\nthemselves out, will have uninterrupted healthcare coverage from the time our\ncampaign ended in early March through the end of April. This is something no\nother campaign has done. And throughout our campaign, we were proud to pay our\nstaff wages and benefits that were much more generous than any other campaign\nthis year. Staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several\nweeks of severance.\"\n\nFormer Bloomberg staffers who were laid off on March 9 were [reportedly\ntold](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-\ndnc.html) they would be paid through March 31. For those laid off on the 20th,\n[the campaign said](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-\ncampaign-layoffs-\ncoronavirus-139362https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-campaign-\nlayoffs-coronavirus-139362) their health insurance benefits would end April\n30. Four former campaign employees, who spoke to ELLE.com on the condition of\nanonymity due to nondisclosure agreements, shared in their own words how their\nlives have been affected.\n\n **** _Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity._\n\n ~~~~\n\n* * *\n\n### \"To sum it up in one word, I feel betrayed.\"\n\nI was one of the organizers from the field operation. I did take the job\nbecause they said, \"Even if [he's] not the candidate, you will have a position\non team Bloomberg through November with pay and benefits.\" But I was laid off\non Friday, March 20. In a separate email that day, I was given notice that I\nwould get paid through the first week of April, and at the end of April my\nhealth insurance would be unenrolled.\n\nI was stunned. I was one of the few people that was there because I truly\nbelieve Mayor Bloomberg would have been a good president. But most important\nto me is the health insurance. I have preexisting conditions and appointments\nevery week. I turn 26 [soon], so I'll have a few weeks of coverage before I\nget kicked off. I'm looking [into] COBRA gap coverage until the fall when my\nwife's work starts. But that's over $1,000 a month. Unemployment may be my\nonly option.\n\n[Bloomberg] spent over $900 million on the failed run. Staff only ever\ncomprised around $28 million of that total. Obviously he has the capacity to\npay for these things. I've worked on a lot of campaigns, and the goals of the\norganization can change. But you need to uphold your end of the bargain.\n\nTo sum it up in one word, I feel betrayed--1,500 lives have been drastically\nchanged overnight. I can't imagine a worse time to leave your employees out to\ndry.\n\n* * *\n\n### \"During the middle of a global pandemic, we're out of work and won't have\nhealth insurance.\"\n\nI left my full time, salaried job to take this [position] with the offer of\nfull benefits. [I was laid off] on Friday, [March 20], on a less than\n10-minute conference call. I was shocked. We worked tirelessly on this\ncampaign. We worked seven days a week, [usually] between 12 and 16 hours. Our\nregional organizing director was adamant that we should always work through\nlunch.\n\nThe lack of communication on this campaign was ridiculous. I found out on\nsocial media [that Bloomberg was dropping out]. There were incidents of racism\nthat were covered up by my regional director, all the way up to our state\norganizing director. (A spokesperson for the campaign told ELLE.com in an\nemailed statement: \"The campaign had a zero-tolerance policy regarding\nharassment or discrimination of any sort. We had a clearly articulated process\nfor escalating complaints to managers and HR. Any concerns that were raised to\nthe campaign HR were handled promptly and appropriately, and any failure to\nhave escalated a concern to HR would have been a clear and unacceptable\nviolation of our policy.\") One day during Get Out The Vote, when it was\npouring rain outside, one of my co-workers called our organizing director and\ntold him he had a fever. He was really sick and had been out canvassing all\nday. Our deputy said, \"Go take a 10-minute break and then get back to it.\"\n\nIt was devastating to find out that during the middle of a global pandemic,\nwe're out of work and won't have health insurance. I need to go to the eye\ndoctor. I need to go to the dentist. But most practices aren't accepting\nappointments [because of the coronavirus]. By the time I'm able to make an\nappointment, I won't have health insurance. I'm looking for other jobs, but\nright now people aren't hiring. I will be applying for unemployment.\n\n* * *\n\n### \"I have medication I'm supposed to take daily... It costs around $5,000 a\nmonth.\"\n\nI have a chronic health issue. I don't qualify for Medicaid, so I just won't\nhave health insurance. I have medication I'm supposed to take daily that was\ngetting covered. It costs around $5,000 a month. I don't know what I'm going\nto do. I'm applying for unemployment, but I need HR to give me the FEIN\n[Federal Employer Identification Number, [_which you need to\napply_](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-file-for-unemployment-\nbenefits-online-2064123) for unemployment]. And now, in the midst of the\ncoronavirus, nobody's hiring.\n\nI felt like it was [all] pretty shitty. We worked 90 hours a week. When we\nwere tired and overworked, they were like, \"Don't worry about it. Just keep\nworking hard. You'll have a job till November.\" It'd been like a rallying cry\non the campaign, to push us to work harder.\n\n* * *\n\n### \"The anger I felt is for my staff.\"\n\nI was an organizing director. After Super Tuesday, we were supposed to have \u2026\nan overview call of how Super Tuesday went. After they made the announcement\non March 4 that we were going to be dropping out, that changed, and they made\nit an all-staff call. [On the call] they said, \"We don't know what this looks\nlike. We are guaranteeing you pay until the end of March. You will have health\ninsurance until March 31st. Your last paycheck will be March 31st.\" They never\ncalled it severance. The language they used was, \"Sit tight while we figure\nthis out.\" They gave very little details. To me, it seemed like they had no\nplan in place for if we did lose Super Tuesday.\n\nThe anger I felt is for my staff. I was the one who'd interviewed them. HQ\ntold me to tell them they would have employment through November. I had to\nsay, \"I am deeply, deeply apologetic for this.\"\n\nThe vast majority of organizers are under the age of 25. These are their first\njobs. A lot of them have relocated, they don't have families in these states,\nand now they're sheltering in place.\n\nOne of my co-workers from 2016 is in the ICU right now. He was a Bloomberg\nemployee, and he has coronavirus. He was part of HQ staff. It's unconscionable\nthat they're going to end health coverage for the majority of employees in the\nmiddle of this COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n[ Jo Yurcaba ](/author/225344/Jo-Yurcaba/) Jo Yurcaba is a North Carolina-\nbased freelance reporter who covers politics, abortion access, and LGBTQ+\nrights.\n\n[](/culture/career-politics/a31895253/kerri-walsh-jennings-olympics-\ntokyo-2020-coronavirus/)\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMore From [Political News 2020](/culture/career-politics/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nCan I Get an Abortion During the Pandemic? ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a31931414/abortion-coronavirus-ohio-texas-mississippi-louisiana/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nAmani Al-Khatahtbeh Is Running For Congress ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a32040892/amani-al-khatahtbeh-first-muslim-woman-new-jersey-run-\nfederal-office/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nYou Can Have Some Good News...As a Treat ](/culture/career-\npolitics/g32036978/good-news-stories-april-3/)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nI'm Terrified For My Incarcerated Father's Life ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a32009519/coronavirus-jail-texas/)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nHow Has COVID-19 Affected the 2020 Elections? ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a31903790/how-to-vote-coronavirus-election-dates/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nThe 2020 DNC Has Been Moved to August ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a28264162/democratic-national-convention-2020-election/)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nWhat It's Like to Be an OB-GYN Nurse During COVID ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a31976642/obgyn-covid-19-nyc-hospitals/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nYour Guide to the 2020 Democratic Primary Debates ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a26992483/democratic-candidates-primary-debates-2020-election/)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nIsolated New Yorkers Clap for Essential Workers ](/culture/career-\npolitics/a31965743/isolated-new-yorkers-clap-essential-workers-coronavirus-\npandemic/)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nGood News That Happened This Week ](/culture/career-politics/g31945229/good-\nnews-stories-this-week/)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [Political News 2020](/culture/career-politics/)\n  * [Culture](/culture/)\n  * [The Best Laid Plans](//www.elle.com/fashion/news/a121/the-best-laid-plans-4579/ \"The Best Laid Plans\")\n  * [Ask E.

I\u2019m getting plenty of work done, but I\u2019m starting to get unnerved by\nthe lack of stimulation. It\u2019s been hours (days?) since I interacted face to\nface with a human who is not related to me, and cabin fever is setting in.\n\nAmong the coronavirus\u2019s many effects is a boom in people like me: office\nworkers, shooed away from the office, trying to acclimate to a work-from-home\nlifestyle.\n\nWhile the outbreak has already created inconveniences (and much worse) for\nmillions of people in the form of travel restrictions, health scares and\n[stock market turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/stock-\nmarket-today.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage), it has been\nan exciting time for some fans of remote work. They argue that quarantined\nworkers are getting a glimpse of our glorious, office-free future.\n\n\u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d\n[wrote Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/), chief\nexecutive of Automattic, the software company that owns the WordPress blogging\nplatform.\n\nMr. Mullenweg, whose company\u2019s work force is fully distributed, sees a silver\nlining in the coronavirus. In his blog post last week, he wrote that it \u201cmight\nalso offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that\nallows long-overdue work flexibility.\u201d\n\nI get where he\u2019s coming from. I was a remote worker for two years a while\nback. For most of that time, I was a work-from-home evangelist who told\neveryone within earshot about the benefits of avoiding the office. No commute!\nNo distracting co-workers! Home-cooked lunch! What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBut I\u2019ve been researching the pros and cons of remote work for my upcoming\n[book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617763/futureproof-by-kevin-\nroose/) about human survival in the age of artificial intelligence and\nautomation. And I\u2019ve now come to a very different conclusion: Most people\nshould work in an office, or near other people, and avoid solitary work-from-\nhome arrangements whenever possible.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: Working from home is a good option for new parents, people\nwith disabilities and others who aren\u2019t well served by a traditional office\nsetup. I don\u2019t think we should ignore health guidelines and force people to\nwork in an office during a pandemic. And I\u2019m sympathetic to the millions of\nteachers, restaurant workers and other professionals for whom working from\nhome has never been a viable option.\n\nBut for those of us lucky enough to be able to work from home, coronavirus or\nno, a few words of caution are in order.\n\nFans of remote work often cite studies showing that people who work from home\nare more productive, like a [2014\nstudy](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/1/165/2337855) led by the\nStanford professor Nicholas Bloom. The study examined remote workers at a\nChinese travel agency and found that they were 13 percent more efficient than\ntheir office-based peers.\n\nBut research also shows that what remote workers gain in productivity, they\noften miss in harder-to-measure benefits like creativity and innovative\nthinking. Studies have found that people working together in the same room\ntend to solve problems more quickly than remote collaborators, and that [team\ncohesion suffers](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/when-\nworking-from-home-doesnt-work/540660/) in remote work arrangements.\n\nRemote workers also tend to take shorter breaks and fewer sick days than\noffice-based ones, and in studies, [many report finding it hard\n](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273761672_Work-\nLife_Balance_and_Working_from_Home)to separate their work from their home\nlives. That\u2019s a good thing if you\u2019re a boss looking to squeeze extra\nefficiency out of your employees, but less ideal if you\u2019re someone trying to\nachieve some work-life balance.\n\nWorking in isolation can be lonely, which explains the popularity of co-\nworking spaces like WeWork and The Wing. Even in Silicon Valley, where the\ntools that allow for remote work are being built, many companies are strict\nabout requiring their workers to come into the office.\n\nSteve Jobs, for one, was a famous opponent of remote work, believing that\nApple employees\u2019 best work came from accidentally bumping into other people,\nnot sitting at home in front of an email inbox.\n\n\u201cCreativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions,\u201d Mr.\nJobs said. \u201cYou run into someone, you ask what they\u2019re doing, you say \u2018Wow,\u2019\nand soon you\u2019re cooking up all sorts of ideas.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll grant that office work has its downsides, even in healthy times.\nCommuting has been shown to make us less happy, and the open-plan office, a\n[truly cursed workplace design\ntrend](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html)\nthat emphasizes airy spaces with rows of desks and little privacy, has made\ndistraction-free focus nearly impossible.\n\nBut being near other people also allows us to express our most human\nqualities, like empathy and collaboration. Those are the skills that can\u2019t be\nautomated. And they\u2019re what produces the kind of meaningful interpersonal\ncontact we miss out on when we\u2019re stuck at home.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an element of social interaction that\u2019s really important,\u201d said\nLaszlo Bock, the chief executive of\n[Humu](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/human-resources-\nartificial-intelligence-humu.html), a Silicon Valley human resources start-up.\n\nMr. Bock, who was previously Google\u2019s top human resources officer, said that\nfor most people, balancing office work with remote work is ideal. His\ncompany\u2019s research has found that the ideal amount of work-from-home time is\none and a half days per week \u2014 enough to participate in office culture, with\nsome time reserved for deep, focused work.\n\n\u201cThe reason tech companies have micro-kitchens and free snacks is not because\nthey think people are going to starve between 9 a.m. and noon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nbecause that\u2019s where you get those moments of serendipity.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, some companies with sizable remote workforces have\nexperimented with ways to create office culture over a distance.\n\nAutomattic, Mr. Mullenweg\u2019s all-remote company, holds an annual weeklong staff\nretreat called the \u201cgrand meetup,\u201d at which workers gather in the same place\nto socialize and work on group projects. At GitLab, an open-source\ncollaboration platform, remote workers are [encouraged to\nschedule](https://qz.com/work/1147877/remote-work-why-we-put-virtual-coffee-\nbreaks-in-our-company-handbook/) \u201cvirtual coffee breaks\u201d \u2014 purely social video\nconferences \u2014 with colleagues they don\u2019t know well.\n\nIf the coronavirus continues preventing people from going to the office, more\ncompanies may need to try tactics like these to help keep their workers happy\nand connected.\n\nBut some people may never be content with virtual water coolers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very personal decision that works for some and doesn\u2019t work for\nothers,\u201d said Julia Austin, a former tech executive and professor at Harvard\nBusiness School. \u201cSome people are more productive and happy and find other\nways to get social contact if they work from home. And some people aren\u2019t\nhappy working alone.\u201d\n\nAs a white-collar millennial, I\u2019m supposed to be cheering on the remote work\nrevolution. But I\u2019ve realized that I can\u2019t be my best, most human self in\nsweatpants, pretending to pay attention on video conferences between trips to\nthe fridge.\n\nI\u2019ll stay home as long as my bosses and the health authorities advise. But\nhonestly, I can\u2019t wait to go back to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * [\u00a9 2020 The New York Times Company](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792127-Copyright-notice)\n\n  * [NYTCo](https://www.nytco.com/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015385887-Contact-Us)\n  * [Work with us](https://www.nytco.com/careers/)\n  * [Advertise](https://nytmediakit.com/)\n  * [T Brand Studio](http://www.tbrandstudio.com/)\n  * [Your Ad Choices](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Privacy](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Terms of Service](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service)\n  * [Terms of Sale](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale)\n  * [Site Map](https://spiderbites.nytimes.com)\n  * [Help](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us)\n  * [Subscriptions](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=37WXW)\n  * \n\n"}, {"item": "Fun Friday: Top 5 employee benefits for 2020 | HRD Asia - Human Resources Director", "link": "https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/fun-friday-top-5-employee-benefits-for-2020/194038", "guid": "CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjYW1hZy5jb20vYXNpYS9uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwvZnVuLWZyaWRheS10b3AtNS1lbXBsb3llZS1iZW5lZml0cy1mb3ItMjAyMC8xOTQwMzjSAQA", "pubdate": "Fri, 06 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/fun-friday-top-5-employee-benefits-for-2020/194038\" target=\"_blank\">Fun Friday: Top 5 employee benefits for 2020 | HRD Asia</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Human Resources Director</font>", "source": "Human Resources Director", "body": "![Human Resources Director Asia](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n[CONTINUE TO SITE __](javascript:dismissIntromercial\\(\\); \"Close\")\n\n![Human Resources Director Asia](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n[CONTINUE TO SITE __](javascript:dismissIntromercialAndGo\\(\\); \"Close\")\n\n__\n\n[ ![](/images/logo_normal.png) ](/asia)\n\n[AU](/au)\n\n[NZ](/nz)\n\n[CA](/ca)\n\n[US](/us)\n\n[Asia](/asia)\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n  * [NEWS](/asia/news/general)\n\n    * [News](/asia/news/general)\n    * [Opinion and best practice](/asia/news/opinion-and-best-practice)\n    * [Special reports](/asia/news/special-reports)\n    * [Profiles](/asia/news/profiles)\n\n  * [ SPECIALISATION ](/asia/specialisation)\n\n    * [Benefits](/asia/specialisation/benefits)\n    * [Change management](/asia/specialisation/change-management)\n    * [Corporate wellness](/asia/specialisation/corporate-wellness)\n    * [Diversity & inclusion](/asia/specialisation/diversity-inclusion)\n    * [Employee engagement](/asia/specialisation/employee-engagement)\n    * [Employment law](/asia/specialisation/employment-law)\n    * [Financial wellness](/asia/specialisation/financial-wellness)\n    * [HR technology](/asia/specialisation/hr-technology)\n    * [Immigration](/asia/specialisation/immigration)\n    * [Industrial relations](/asia/specialisation/industrial-relations)\n    * [Leadership](/asia/specialisation/leadership)\n    * [Learning & development](/asia/specialisation/learning-development)\n    * [Mental health](/asia/specialisation/mental-health)\n    * [MICE](/asia/specialisation/mice)\n    * [Payroll](/asia/specialisation/payroll)\n    * [Workplace health and safety](/asia/specialisation/workplace-health-and-safety)\n    * [Recruitment](/asia/specialisation/recruitment)\n    * [Reward & recognition](/asia/specialisation/reward-recognition)\n\n  * [EVENTS](/asia/hr-events)\n\n    * [Asia HR events](/asia/hr-events)\n    * [All HR events](/asia/all-hr-events)\n\n  * [JOBS](/asia/jobs)\n  * [RESOURCES](/asia/resources)\n\n    * [White papers](/asia/white-papers)\n    * [Multimedia](/asia/resources)\n    * [Exclusive features](/asia/exclusive-features)\n\n  * [SUBSCRIBE](/asia/newsletter)\n  * __\n\n  1.

In fact, four in five workers would\neven turn down a job if it lacked the option for remote work, according to\nworkspace specialist IWG.\n\nIf the past year is anything to go by, 2020 will see employers competing for\ntalent by offering meaningful (and unique!) benefits. Here are the top\nemployee perks that will continue to make headlines in 2020:\n\n**Student loan repayment**  \nIn 2019, the student debt crisis in the US ballooned to more than US$1.5tn,\nthe highest it has ever been. Employers are thus using student loan repayment\nas a way to [attract Millennial and Generation Z\nworkers](https://www.hcamag.com/au/business-news/want-to-hire-millennials-\nbetter-help-repay-student-debt/174839) to their team. Companies typically\noffer a fixed amount - $100 a month, for instance - which goes directly into\ndebt repayment.\n\n**Fertility benefits**  \nWith more workers prioritizing their career and choosing to have children\nlater in life or through alternative means, employers are starting to provide\na more extensive range of fertility benefits as part of their health plans.\n\nThese perks include egg freezing and in vitro fertilization, as well as\nsurrogacy and adoption support services. This year, global banks [JP\nMorgan](https://www.hcamag.com/au/news/general/jp-morgan-to-offer-fertility-\nbenefits-to-lgbtq-staff/170730) and [Goldman\nSachs](https://www.hcamag.com/au/news/general/goldman-sachs-offers-staff-\nfertility-treatment-benefits/190747) expanded their fertility benefits to help\nemployees plan their family amid the demands of their career.\n\n**Pawternity benefits**  \nPet-friendly offices often allow employees to [take their fur-babies to\nwork](https://www.hcamag.com/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/pet-\nfriendly-offices-what-you-need-to-know/170292) during special occasions, but\nthere's more to the pawternity benefit than just letting staffers introduce\ntheir pets to the team.\n\nSome companies pattern this incentive after some of the more traditional\nparental benefits, which allow working mothers/fathers to take leave and be\nwith their child if they are in need of urgent care. Pawternity is the same -\nonly this time it's for their fur-babies.\n\nSome employers have begun offering paid time-off to workers who are welcoming\na new pup or kitten into their home, while others also provide bereavement\nleave to 'hoomans' who suffer the loss of their pet.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n**Telehealth services**  \nEmployers are beginning to subscribe to holistic health and wellness services\nthat are accessible to workers across digital platforms. [Telehealth or\nvirtual health care](https://www.hcamag.com/au/news/general/health-comes-of-\ndigital-age/159809) enables employees to consult with a medical professional\non a range of physical and mental health matters, either online (video), by\nphone or through a mobile app. Support services are available on demand and in\nthe privacy of their own home.\n\n**Transportation and fuel allowance**  \nThe daily commute to the workplace can be costly and exhausting, but employers\nare lending a helping hand either by shouldering the cost of public transport\nor by handing out fuel cards. Giving your staff fuel cards, for one,\neliminates the need for them to file reimbursement claims periodically.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Employees value 'meaningful work' ahead of

After all, with the city\u2019s low unemployment rate, ageing\npopulation and disengaged younger generation, securing the right person for\nthe job is an increasingly tricky proposition.\n\n\u201cFrom an attractiveness standpoint, it\u2019s getting more and more interactive,\u201d\nsaid Bianca Wong, global head of rewards and VP, HR North Asia, at\nprofessional construction company Hilti, when asked by _Human Resources_ about\nthe importance of a finding the right compensation package when try to secure\nthe ideal person for a role.\n\n\u201c(Candidates) don\u2019t necessarily come to you about money, but they come to you\nabout what the conditions are like. \u2018Do I need to work long hours? Do I need\nto travel a lot? What reward to I get for my family if I need to move\noverseas?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI consistently get asked these questions when I recruit people. So I think\nthese sort of personal needs are becoming more of a priority. People are\ngetting more proactive about asking for what they want,\u201d she added.\n\nThe concept of wellness and mental health in the workplace is also getting\nincreased traction, with healthcare benefits getting more focus in C&B\npackages.\n\n\u201cI also see something very interesting in health benefits. Many companies\noffer health benefits already. Previously when I\u2019ve been recruiting it\u2019s been\nlike \u2018I know what the company is offering and that\u2019s about it,\u201d said Wong.\n\n\u201cThese days \u2013 particularly in Asia \u2013 I am seeing candidates more particularly\nask about the details of the health benefits. It seems to me that there is no\nofficial survey (anecdotally) but that healthcare benefits are important for\ncandidates to attract them. And I think goes part and parcel with the well\nbeing and so forth. It is becoming a serious consideration factor.\u201d\n\nEePing Yeoh, APAC Head of Talent Acquisition at New York-based professional\nlearning firm Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG) concurs, pointing out that an\nadequate healthcare component is essential to a good benefits package.\n\n\u201cIt really depends on the seniority of the positions but in summary we are\ntrying to reward top performers by giving very generous healthcare benefits, a\nperformance-driven bonus (and) a flexible working arrangement,\u201d said Yeoh.\n\nShe added that some other sweeteners such as a company-wide summer party,\nFriday happy hour and year-end party could also make the package more\nappealing.\n\nWhile being a strong band can be an inducement to some candidates, every\ncompany can\u2019t be a Google \u2013 a strong and appropriate employee benefits package\nremains crucial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally key to provide an overall package that\u2019s on par with what the\nmarket is offering. We hire a lot of young talent and it\u2019s key to think\ncreatively and provide something more than what the competitors are providing\nto attract and retain top talent,\u201d adds Yeoh.\n\nA 2017 study by Robert Half estimates that by 2020, more than half of the\nglobal workforce will be millennial-aged. With the bulk of the modern-day\nworkforce about to consist of millennials, engaging this demographic with a\nseductive C&B package is crucial.\n\n\u201cMillennials are ambitious and expects fast career growth. We need to meet\ntheir expectations otherwise we will lose them to our competition,\u201d said\nCecilia Leong VP for Human Resources, Greater China at hotel and hospitality\nfirm Marriott International.\n\n> ##### **There will be more unique packages offered, more specific to the\n> employee\u2019s needs rather than following an industry standard. This whole\n> concept of benchmarking is going to go away.**\n\n**Riffing on the gig economy  \n**Another consideration for HR to factor into the mix is the rise of the gig\neconomy. While this has largely evolved on the back of ride-hailing companies\nlike Uber and Didi and food delivery outfits like Deliveroo and foodpanda \u2013\nemploying a relatively low-skilled or intransient workforce \u2013 this is\nchanging.\n\n\u201cRight now, the gig economy is a headache for a lot of HR professionals,\u201d said\nWong from Hilti.\n\nThe gig economy now includes a pool of highly skilled professionals with a\nsought-after area of expertise seeking short-term assignments \u2013nursing\nmothers, retirees and those on a career break, for example.\n\nThis new band of \u201cgiggers\u201d is also given rise to trend in so-called portable\nbenefits.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the gig economy, people will embrace these portable packages,\u201d\nsaid Wong.\n\n\u201cPensions are always a good example where you only get the full thing when\nyou\u2019ve been with the company for 10 years \u2013 I think that sort of idea is going\nto fade away. If you can offer portable benefits then people can basically\nmove from one place to another. That attracts the person to come to you\nbecause they know it gives them some sort of flexibility,\u201d added Wong.\n\n\u201cSo I think on that front more companies are going to collaborate (on this)\nbecause portable benefits don\u2019t work if just one company does it.\u201d\n\nVendor platform in the United States are already embracing this concept in\nlocations such as Silicon Valley, with platform sharing between tech\ncompanies. Microsoft is one that has already apparently signed up. So in this\nway, when an individual moves to the next company, hopefully they are also\nsigned up with the platform \u2013 then the longevity of the benefits will be held\nthrough the platform.\n\n\u201cI hope that this will also catch on in Asia. Especially as we have a large\nnumber of SMEs who would benefit from it. SMEs often struggle to offer a\ncompetitive package compared to the multinationals. But for example in a\nfintech company, say about 30 people, they do great business and they need\ngreat talent \u2013 and these sorts of platforms would really help them,\u201d said\nWong.\n\nWong believes such initiatives are going to become mandatory as the workforce\nbecomes increasingly fluid.\n\n\u201cIn future it\u2019s going to be a much smaller pool of regular staff and a much\nlarger pool of giggers,\u201d she added.\n\n> ##### **In future it\u2019s going to be a much smaller pool of regular staff and\n> a much larger pool of giggers. Right now, the gig economy is a headache for\n> a lot of HR professionals**\n\n**Horses for courses  \n**Of course, employee benefits are differentiated across sectors \u2013 what\u2019s\npass\u00e9 in one sector may be highly prized in another. What works in one\nindustry might be a flop in another.\n\n\u201cIn Hong Kong, we focus on hard-to-fill positions which dictates that there is\na level of price elasticity. So total compensation inclusive of both basic\nremuneration and bonus is what is important for most of our candidates,\u201d said\nAbimanu Jayakumar, Head of Selby Jennings, Hong Kong \u2013 a recruitment firm\nspecialising in finding roles for banking professionals working within Hong\nKong.\n\nWhile employee benefits demands in a supply chain / manufacturing industry\nrecruitment firm bringing professionals to Hong Kong for a role has a\ndifferent focus.\n\n\u201cThe amount of annual leave, short- and long-term incentive plan, signing\nbonuses, the relocation package (housing, transportation, schooling, meals,\netc) and gym memberships\u201d are all key components in the compensation package,\nsaid Randy Chan, head of supply chain recruitment firm DSJ Global, APAC.\n\nAccording to Jamie Thorpe, head of Phaidon International, Hong Kong, who hires\npeople to join the firm as recruiters, \u201cAs we are a sales firm, the commission\nis a key pull factor, however over the last few years more graduates are\nconcerned with flexibility and health benefits.\u201d\n\n**Where to next?  \n**With such a varied and dynamic landscape, human resources will need to keep\non their toes to continue to deliver the best employee benefits package when\nsecuring talent for a new role.\n\n\u201cThe best trend for me is evolving away from the one-size fits all program.\nIt\u2019s becoming much more customised, personalised, individualised. I think in\nHong Kong the concept of benchmarking, seeing what other companies are doing \u2013\nthat concept will go away.\u201d said Wong from Hilti.\n\nAnd while companies, and the individuals that make them up, are very different\n\u2013from manufacturing, to retail sales, to a fintech start-up \u2013 the one\nconsistent aspect for HR pros is that they will need to become more creative\nwith their compensation packages.\n\n\u201cThere will be more unique packages offered, more specific to the employee\u2019s\nneeds rather than following an industry standard. That to me is the biggest\ntrend. And I think because of this, this whole concept of benchmarking is\ngoing to go away,\u201d concluded Wong.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**ALSO READ**\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/08095323/Q2-135x180.png)](https://issuu.com/humanresourcesonline/docs/hrhk_q219)\n\nHuman Resources magazine, Hong Kong, Quarter 2, 2019\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

It\u2019s no longer a one-size-fits-\nall benefits marketplace and to retain top talent, leading companies are using\ntechnology to improve benefits via personalization, flexibility and\nempowerment, writes Rob Whalen, CEO of PTO Exchange.**_\n\nToday\u2019s workplace is constantly evolving -- and technology is helping to usher\nin advances in just about every area of work. When it comes to employee\nbenefits, technological advances are changing how employers provide benefits\nand educate employees about the variety of choices available to them.\nAdvancements in technology also make benefits and HR managers\u2019 work more data-\ndriven, which helps employers develop employee benefits packages that cater to\neach workforce and help retain top talent in return. Leading companies are\nusing technology to improve the benefits landscape in three key ways:\npersonalization, flexibility, and empowerment.\n\n## **Personalizing benefits improve engagement**\n\nTechnology enables employers to create more customized benefits programs that\nbetter appeal to each employee\u2019s specific needs. Personalization also allows\nemployers to better educate employees about the many benefits choices\navailable. The result is often increased employee participation in important\nbenefits such as HSA plans. Signing up for a new health plan can be\noverwhelming to many employees. However, when employers personalize the\nprocess via an online portal with a series of questions to help identify needs\nand then provide recommendations that specifically fit those needs, the\nprocess is streamlined and the employee walks away feeling better about their\nchoices. For instance, if an employee enrolls in a high deductible health plan\n(HDHP), the online portal can be configured to send the employee a\npersonalized email with information about HSA plans. Once the employee\nunderstands the financial benefits of an HSA plan, they more often than not\nwill enroll in the plan to save money. Personalization is opening up doors for\nnew levels of engagement in employee benefits and companies invested in\nproviding a better employee experience will reap the benefits.\n\n**Learn more:** **[Employee Engagement vs. Job Satisfaction: Key Differences\nand Metrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-job-satisfaction-differences/)**\n\n## **Flexible benefits help employees choose what matters most to them**\n\nTechnology also enables employers to offer flexible benefits designed to fit\nthe needs of each employee at any given time. Flexible benefits are just\nthat\u2026flexible, meaning employees get to choose how to use their earned\nbenefits. For example, if an employee has an unexpected emergency and doesn\u2019t\nhave enough in savings to cover it, employers can transfer the value of their\nunused paid time off (PTO) to a specific need -- instead of resorting to\ntaking out payday loans or draining their 401(k) plans. In this way,\ntechnology allows employees to have the flexibility to use their earned\nbenefits for what matters most to them at any given time. Not all employers\noffer flexible benefits yet but the shift is gaining momentum as employers\nbecome more concerned about the overall wellbeing of their employees and the\nbottom-line benefits associated with engaging employees in this way. Studies\nhave shown that when employees are free from financial stress, their job\nperformance improves. Companies that offer flexible benefits will undoubtedly\nsee an increase in employee[ job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/),\nproductivity, and even creativity.\n\n## **Empowering employees to take charge of benefits decisions creates better\noutcomes**\n\nTechnology is also empowering employees to take charge of their benefits\ndecisions -- increasingly important both as the workforce turns to gig workers\nand as the working middle class in America continue to overwhelmingly live\npaycheck to paycheck. Virtual healthcare is an area that is empowering\nemployees to take more control over their healthcare needs and costs. Instead\nof making a doctor\u2019s appointment whenever a health issue arises, employees can\nuse their employer\u2019s or healthcare provider\u2019s telemedicine solution to ask a\ndoctor for guidance. Employees also feel empowered when they have options such\nas the ability to redirect their hard-earned PTO to priorities that matter\nmost to them -- such as paying down school loan debt, funding their 401(k)\nretirement plans or going on a vacation.\n\nTechnology enables employers and employees to change the benefits landscape\nfor good. Today, employers and employees have the ability to work together to\ndefine which benefits work best for each individual employee. It\u2019s no longer a\none-size-fits-all benefits marketplace. Technology has pushed us to reconsider\nand redefine how benefits -- the #2 job consideration factor -- can better\nserve employees and employers alike. Transforming how we administer and\ndeliver benefits will impact our ability to effectively engage talent in 2020.\n\n**Learn more:[The Value of Comprehensive Benefits for Small\nBusinesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/the-\nvalue-of-comprehensive-benefits-for-small-businesses/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2F3-ways-technology-is-transforming-\nbenefits%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Ways+Technology+is+Transforming+Benefits\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Ways+Technology+is+Transforming+Benefits&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2F3-ways-technology-is-transforming-\nbenefits%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2F3-ways-technology-is-transforming-\nbenefits%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2F3-ways-technology-is-transforming-\nbenefits%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Ways Technology is Transforming\nBenefits&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2F3-ways-technology-is-transforming-\nbenefits%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Compensation & Benefits ](/category/compensation-\nbenefits/ \"Compensation & Benefits\")\n\n  * [ ![Employee Benefits Trends 2020: 5 Ways to Benefit](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/five_employee_benefits_trends_for_2020_5e15b8a64ea0e.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/employee-benefits-trends-2020/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Employee Benefits Trends 2020: 5 Ways to Benefit\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/employee-\nbenefits-trends-2020/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nIs your benefits catalog 2020-ready?

employers are coming up with\ngame changing employee benefits to cater to their lifestyles.\n\nBy: [Daniel Teo](https://hrmasia.com/author/daniel/ \"Posts by Daniel Teo\") |\nDecember 30, 2019\n\nTopics: [Compensation and\nBenefits](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Employee Experience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-\nexperience/) | [News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/84127827_l.jpg)\n\nIf you're thinking annual leave, sick leave and insurance coverage, it's time\nto get ahead of times.\n\nWith the competition for talents especially among the millennial and Gen Z\nworkforce showing no signs of slowing, employers are cracking their heads in\ncoming up with innovative and never-heard-before employee benefits to cater to\nand attract new talents.\n\nWhile the traditional benefits such as annual, sick and paternity leave and\ninsurance remain the bread and butter of employee benefits, there is an\nincreasing need for employers to keep up with the modern and evolving\nlifestyles of the younger workforce today.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the latest and game-changing employee benefits\nfor the upcoming year.\n\n**1) Paid babysitters**\n\nAs part of their health and wellness initiatives, [PayPal and Microsoft have\nteamed up with a provider of employer-sponsored childcare to hire and pay for\nbabysitters](http://hrmasia.com/the-gift-that-gives-back-this-christmas/). The\nidea is to free up time so their employees can attend the holiday party or\nwork during the break when their kids are off school. While this trend is\ngrowing in the US, it hasn\u2019t been introduced in Asia yet. Parents in Asia will\nbe crying out for this to catch on in their region.\n\n**2) Pawternity benefits**\n\nWhile employees' kids are taken care of by the babysitters, the furkids are\nnot forgotten as well. With pet ownership at an all-time high and pets\nconsidered as part of the family for many employees, employers are coming up\nwith pawternity leave. It's the same way it works for the traditional\npaternity leave - but this time for their furkids. Employees whose pets are\nunwell or are welcoming a new puppy or kitten can take paid time-off to spend\nmore time with them.\n\n**3) Egg freezing**\n\nWith more female workers delaying their family planning as they prioritise\ntheir careers, companies such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are recognising\ntheir sacrifices by including perks such as egg freezing, in vitro\nfertilization (IVF), as well as surrogacy and adoption support services as\npart of their employee benefits.\n\n**4) Student loan r** **eimbursement**\n\nIn a bid to attract younger talents, companies like Burger King are\nintroducing benefits such as Student Loan Reimbursement to help those that are\nfresh out of school and laden with student loans. Companies usually offer to\npay a fixed amount (e.g. $100/month) to help pay off their loans.\n\n**5) 4-day work week**\n\nIt might be a trial by Microsoft Japan, but the positive results that came out\nof it might encourage more employers to give a serious thought to it. There\nwas a 40% increase in sales compared to the same month last year. On top of\nthis, there was a 23% drop in electricity usage and 59% fewer pages printed,\npartly due to the telecommuting initiative run during the same period. After\nthe trial month, 92% of employees approved of the shorter working weeks. Soon\nit might be TGIT instead of TGIF!\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftop-\nemployee-benefit-trends-of-2020%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+employee+benefits+to+look+out+for+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftop-\nemployee-benefit-trends-of-2020%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftop-\nemployee-benefit-trends-of-2020%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Indeed,\nemployees are forcing the issue by becoming more vocal about the life issues\nthey are having \u2014 and how they expect their employers to help.\n\nUsing specialized programs\n[organizations](https://www.benefitnews.com/list/employers-that-added-new-\nbenefits-this-year) are now expanding the traditional definition of wellness\nto include a host of offerings. These progressive companies are implementing\nbenefits that help employees take on [_student loan\ndebt_](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-of-\nmassachusetts-takes-steps-to-ease-employee-student-debt), launching [_expanded\nEAPs_](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/healthjoy-expands-with-launch-of-eap),\nand [_offering savings vehicles_](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/metlife-\nadds-hsa-fsa-and-commuter-account-options) beyond the traditional 401(k). But\nthere is more that can be done.\n\nAll of these offerings fall under the umbrella of employee wellness, which is\ngoing to be at the top of mind for HR and benefits professionals in 2020,\naccording to top HR [_experts forecasting the most important benefits for the\nnew year_](https://www.benefitnews.com/list/experts-predict-2020s-most-in-\ndemand-benefits). Going into 2020 employers may want to consider beefing up\ntheir wellness benefits to be more holistic, experts say.\n\nWhen it comes to wellness benefits, employers tend to focus on one aspect of a\nperson\u2019s well-being, be it financial, mental, or physical. But the key to a\nmore well-rounded wellness benefit is to take a wider approach and recognize\nthe impact stress can have on every aspect of a person\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThe link between mental and physical health has been increasingly recognized\nin the clinical world,\u201d says Dr. Tista Ghosh, senior director of impact\nevaluation at healthcare company Grand Rounds. \u201cAs the clinical realm shifts\nto a more holistic view of the patient, employers should similarly model their\nbenefits under the same mindset when it comes to wellness benefits. Financial,\nphysical and mental health are all intertwined.\u201d\n\n **See also:**[ _Experts predict 2020\u2019s most in-demand\nbenefits_](https://www.benefitnews.com/list/experts-predict-2020s-most-in-\ndemand-benefits)\n\nThe issues employees face in their daily lives can impact their physical and\nemotional wellness, causing a decline in productivity and increased\nabsenteeism at work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to invest in benefits that impact employees\u2019 overall\nenvironment,\u201d says Heather Lavallee, president of tax exempt markets and head\nof the Voya Cares team at Voya Financial. \u201cOutside-the-box benefits provide a\nsense of caring on behalf of your organization, which generates loyalty and\ncommitment. It also helps reduce stress for employees and, therefore,\nincreases productivity across the company.\u201d\n\nAbout two-thirds of professionals say their stress levels at work are higher\nthan they were five years ago, according to research by the Korn Ferry\nInstitute, a leadership and talent consulting firm. Of the nearly 2,000\nprofessionals surveyed, 76% say stress at work has had a negative impact on\ntheir personal relationships, and 66% say they have lost sleep due to work\nstress. Sixteen percent said stress made them quit a job. Stress can have a\nphysical reaction on the body including headaches, muscle pain, chest pain,\nfatigue and mood swings, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nMore than half (58%) of organizations offer their employees a general wellness\nprogram, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. Wellness\nbenefits have been heavily discussed and marketed to employees over the last\ndecade. Yet, wellness programs didn\u2019t show any changing trend in the last\nyear, SHRM says. In fact, five year trends show moderate declines in more\ntraditional wellness activities. Preventative programs specifically targeting\nemployees with chronic health conditions have decreased to 24% in 2019 from\n40% in 2015, according to SHRM.\n\n**Student loan burden**  \nA major financial stressor for many employees is student loan debt. The U.S.\nstudent debt balance has ballooned to more than $1.6 **** trillion, according\nto the Federal Reserve. While employees will appreciate a debt repayment\nbenefit, that one offering only addresses a single part of the problem.\n\nIndeed, 53% of high debt borrowers have experienced depression because of\ntheir loans and nine in 10 borrowers experienced significant anxiety as a\nresult, according to a survey by Student Loan Planner, a debt management\nservice. More disturbing, one in 15 of the loan borrowers surveyed said they\nhad considered suicide as a result of their debt.\n\nThis stress \u2014 which may not be alleviated with the addition of a single\nbenefit \u2014 can result in a loss of productivity and increased turnover. But, if\nan employer were to couple that student debt repayment plan with access to\nmental health services, they\u2019d have taken a real step in improving an\nemployee\u2019s overall wellness.\n\n\u201cCoupling student loan benefits with mental health benefits is going to be a\nburgeoning trend with employers in 2020,\u201d says Greg Poulin, CEO of student\nloan benefits provider Goodly. \u201cAn emerging trend we saw from employers in\n2019 was recognizing the impact such an astronomical amount of student debt\ntakes on the productivity and mental health of employees.\u201d\n\nOne of the main drivers of the stress and anxiety that go along with student\nloan debt is that employees don\u2019t know where to turn for help, Poulin says.\n\n\u201cMany employers are recognizing this and adding student loan benefits and\nmental health programs to their benefits packages, which is a trend we expect\nto continue throughout 2020 based on the demand we've seen from employers,\u201d he\nadds.\n\n**Parental Stress**  \nAnother tactic employers can take is to offer a paid parental leave benefit\ncoupled with a [_backup child care\nbenefit_](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/how-one-organization-wants-to-\nchange-child-care-benefits). Child care benefits are uncommon, and have shown\nlittle change in the past five years, despite a steady increase in services\nsupporting new mothers, according to SHRM.\n\nBecoming a new parent and then trying to navigate returning to work can be\nanother factor that contributes to an employee\u2019s physical, mental and\nfinancial stress \u2014 especially for women. About 40% of women will exit the\nworkforce after they have their first child, says Shadiah Sigala, CEO of\nKinside, a child care benefit provider. About 75% of them say the top reason\nthey leave has to do with child care needs, she says.\n\n\u201cOnce paid parental leave is over and you\u2019re back in the office, there\u2019s an\nexpectation that all goes back to normal,\u201d Sigala says. \u201cOf course, nothing\nfeels normal about placing a six-week-old child in the hands of a stranger,\npaying 20% of your annual salary to do it and a good amount of your mental\nfortitude to withstand it.\u201d\n\nMore than half (52%) of new moms surveyed by OnePoll say one of their top five\nconcerns while at work is if their baby is safe. Women\u2019s labor force\nparticipation has stagnated and reversed since 2000, according to The\nBrookings Institution, a public policy research organization. The cost of\nchild care can make center-based care and even employment itself difficult for\nworking mothers, Brookings says. The average center-based program for infants\ncan cost more than $16,000 per year. By offering a back up child care benefit,\nemployers are uniquely positioned to help alleviate this financial and\nemotional burden.\n\n\u201cAmerican businesses are losing $12.7 billion every year because of employee\nchildcare challenges \u2014 complementing paid leave with child care is a benefit\nduo that pays back,\u201d Sigala says.\n\nCompanies that offer benefits that target multiple stressors in their\nemployees\u2019 lives will see an increase in employee loyalty and productivity.\nBut more than that, employees are truly grateful when their employer shows\nthem they care.\n\nWhen Danielle Moore, director of communication at Noodles & Company, started\nher career with the restaurant organization three years ago, she was nervous\nto tell her new employer that she was expecting her first child.\n\n\u201cI was really hesitant about what becoming a new mom and being a director at a\ncompany would look like for me as far as lifestyle and balance,\u201d Moore says.\n\u201cI was completely surprised by how easy Noodles has made this adjustment for\nme and the other new moms.\u201d\n\nNoodles offers its employees an array of family and wellness benefits designed\nto help them get a better handle on their work-life balance, including a\nhealth and wellness reimbursement program known as balance bucks.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of stressors that I wasn\u2019t anticipating as a new mom,\u201d Moore\nsays. \u201cHaving access to the balance bucks and our company being really\nflexible with how we exercise those is really helpful.\u201d\n\nMoving into 2020 employers should consider beefing up their wellness benefit\nofferings as a way to fully invest in their employees\u2019 overall well-being,\naccording to Kate Ryder, founder and CEO of Maven Clinic.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, by prioritizing wellness programs in 2020 and beyond,\nemployers can demonstrate their commitment to employees\u2019 overall health and\nwell-being, while driving satisfaction and productivity, improving health\noutcomes, and lowering costs,\u201d Ryder says.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b4c165/2147483647/strip/true/crop/195x195+7+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcb%2Fb0%2F9f870dfd44e19e452df9fe002101%2Fsourcemedia.brightspotcdn-1.jpg)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/amanda-schiavo)\n\n[Amanda

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nRick Ramos\n\nChief Marketing Officer at [HealthJoy](https://healthjoy.com/), a benefits\nexperience platform helping employees make smarter healthcare decisions.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nThe focus on customer experience (CX) has been gaining popularity in recent\nyears. The term CX refers to the experience a person has with a brand or\ncompany at every touch point along the buyer\u2019s journey. A touch point is\nconsidered to be any interaction a company has when dealing with a brand. It\ncan be pre-sale (e.g., social media or an ad), purchasing (e.g., salesperson\nor packaging) or post-sale (e.g., customer service or billing).\n\nAt its core, you can think of CX as what someone feels about your brand when\nthey are interacting with it. An outstanding CX makes everything easy and\nenjoyable.\n\nTo look at benefits through the same lens, think about the experience your\nemployee has while they use their company-sponsored benefits.\n\nSome companies depend on an open enrollment meeting where they distribute\nprinted benefit booklets, provide lunch, explain the benefits over the hour\nand then leave their employees to navigate their benefits on their own. With a\npoor CX like this, it\u2019s no wonder healthcare costs are nearly [$15,000 per\nemployee](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/pages/employers-adjust-health-benefits-for-2019.aspx) for\ncompanies. The system is complex; prices aren\u2019t transparent, and most people\n(thankfully) use their health benefits infrequently.\n\nFor the last five years, I\u2019ve been part of the team at HealthJoy, working to\ncreate a benefits experience platform. Throughout that process, I\u2019ve used many\nCX techniques to simplify the experience year-round. Human resources can use\nsome of those same techniques to make the benefits experience better. If you\nare working with benefits, improving your employee experience can start with\nthinking about CX. Here are some things to consider:\n\n**Employees\u2019 Benefit Journey**\n\nYour most fundamental information will be a holistic understanding of your\nemployees\u2019 benefits journey. You need to dig in and experience every step\nalong the way. From there, you can build a map of the journey as a whole.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to just guess at what the employee experience looks like. It\u2019s\nessential to put yourself in the shoes of your employees as they try to\nnavigate the complicated web of benefits we\u2019ve built.\n\nMost benefits packages have 10-20 different vendors, but I\u2019ve seen as many as\n100. At the same time, we\u2019re dealing with a \u201ccustomer\u201d who has a really low\nlevel of benefits awareness. In fact, a\n[survey](https://www.policygenius.com/health-insurance/health-insurance-\nliteracy-survey/) found that 96% of Americans can\u2019t define the four most\ncommon health insurance terms.\n\nIf you have a lot of benefits, your map of the employee experience can become\nunwieldy, but the process is worth it. Our ultimate goal is to anticipate an\nemployee\u2019s needs so you can remove friction. You can\u2019t remove friction from a\nprocess you don\u2019t understand.\n\nThe employee benefits experience falls into three distinct categories:\n\n**1\\. Onboarding:** The first experience your employee has with their benefits\nis critical. After they attend an open enrollment meeting and select their\nbenefits, what happens? Are your vendors emailing your employees? Are people\ndownloading their app? Do they need to go to your benefits website for more\ninformation? Are they reading the emails you are sending?\n\n**2\\. Maintaining And Using:** Signing up for company benefits is one thing.\nOutside of open enrollment, how many steps do employees have to take to use\nthem? What is customer service like for all your different benefits? What is\nthe support experience like when something goes wrong? What are the hold times\nfor your carriers? How are their websites?\n\n**3\\. Renewal:** The benefits plan renewal step is an important one to map\nbecause it can often be complicated and confusing for employees. It will\nprobably look different for every vendor. Are the costs going up for some of\nyour plans? Are you using a benefits admin tool? Consider each step in the\nrenewal process from the employee\u2019s viewpoint.\n\n**Review Employee** **Touch Points**\n\nNext, you need to look at all the different touch points provided by you and\nyour vendors. This includes apps, websites, advertising, brochures, etc. You\nalso should understand the support they receive through their journey, call\ncenters, chat, etc.\n\nTouch points can be a source of friction for users, and understanding them\nwill give you a lot of insight into your employee experience. A vendor telling\nyou they \u201chave an app\u201d is different than downloading, and using it. Read the\nreviews to see what users think of it. Scan through their release notes and\nsee how often their app is updated.\n\nMany companies produce their own benefits websites. As you might already know,\nit can be an incredible undertaking to make a genuinely engaging benefits\nwebsite. Creating a static website with WordPress or another content\nmanagement system is relatively simple, but creating a personalized website\nthat only delivers relevant information to an employee is a daunting task. It\nrequires integration with third-party vendors and constant updating and\ntesting throughout the year. There might be hundreds of touch points for your\nemployees to deal with, but it\u2019s important to review, map and understand the\nmost important ones.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nI\u2019ve worked on creating a streamlined benefits experience for the last five\nyears, and I can say that fully understanding the problem is the first step in\nmaking it better. Once you understand the potential employee journey, you\u2019ll\nreally appreciate the daunting task we are asking them to undertake. An\nalphabetical listing of vendors in a benefits booklet with phone numbers and\nwebsites isn\u2019t a functional customer experience. It certainly isn\u2019t the answer\nto lowering your healthcare costs or increasing employee satisfaction.\n\nYou\u2019ll find that many of the touch points you identified are under vendor\ncontrol, and you\u2019ll have no way to change the experience. By mapping the\nentire customer journey, you can focus your efforts on eliminating friction in\nareas that are under your control: what you present your employees during\nonboarding, which specific touch points you highlight and the messages you\npresent throughout the year. Improving your employee benefits CX will take\ntime, but I think this discipline holds incredible potential for HR.\n\n[Forbes Communications\nCouncil](http://www.forbescommcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media\nstrategy, creative and advertising agencies. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbescommcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Rick Ramos](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbescommunicationscouncil/files/2020/02/rickramos1_avatar_1582831114.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/people/rickramos1/\n\"Photo of Rick Ramos\")\n\n[Rick\nRamos](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/people/rickramos1/)\n\nChief Marketing Officer at [HealthJoy](https://healthjoy.com/), a benefits\nexperience platform helping employees make smarter healthcare decisions.

This week\nis National Simplify Your Life Week in the U.S., and you can help employees\nsimplify their lives by offering them some unique employee benefits.\n\nFrom health and wellness solutions to others that give them more time in their\nworkday, here\u2019s how some simple offerings can turn employees\u2019 lives around.\n\n## **1\\. Flexibility at Work**\n\nNo prizes for guessing that workplace flexibility tops our list. It may not be\nentirely unique, but a flexible work environment is not as common as you would\nthink. [Four in five U.S. small businesses have no formal remote working\npolicy in place](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/mobile-workforce/four-in-\nfive-us-small-businesses-have-no-formal-remote-working-policy-in-place/).\nCompanies continue to impose arbitrary working hours in the office and offer\nlittle flexibility in working remotely.\n\nHowever, there are several [best practices followed by successful remote-\nworking companies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-\nworkforce/4-best-practices-for-successful-remote-companies/), and by the\nfollowing suit, you can reap the benefits of improved engagement with your\nworkforce. Some companies also implement test runs such as Work From Home\nWeek, during which all employees are made to work from home. Companies then\ntest the output from working remotely versus working on-site and then making\nan informed decision about what works for their organization.\n\nIn an exclusive with HR Technologist, Grant Christofely, Senior Strategist,\nAssociate \u2013 Certified Scrum Master at [M Moser\nAssociates](https://www.mmoser.com/en/), says, \u201cYou see a revolution by\nemployees demanding greater flexibility in how, when, and where they do their\nwork. There has been a shift in the way people see their lives that at a daily\nscale manifests itself in demanding more flexibility at work.\u201d\n\nAnd while a lot of organizations offer flexibility when asked for it, not all\nemployees feel comfortable telling their bosses they would like to work from\nhome.\n\nFor instance, the Head of Learning and Development of Bynder, Ruben Vermaak,\nshared an example with us in an [exclusive\ninterview](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/mobile-workforce/ruben-\nvermaak-interview-benefits-of-working-remotely/). \u201cOur founder and CEO was\ntalking to an employee who expressed if she could work remotely on a nice\nsunny day, but didn\u2019t feel like she had the liberty to leave the office to do\nso. The fact is, there\u2019s never a great time to be out of the office \u2013\nespecially in a fast-moving work environment. But that doesn\u2019t mean employees\nshould feel tethered to their desks, especially if that\u2019s not where they work\nbest.\u201d\n\nGiving employees such freedoms at some level makes them more committed to\ndoing their jobs well. They want to ensure that these freedoms remain in\nplace.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Why AI is the Future of Benefits\nPersonalization**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-\nadministration/why-ai-is-the-future-of-benefits-personalization/)\n\n## **2\\. Health and Wellness Benefits**\n\nOverall wellness \u2013 physical, emotional, and mental \u2013 is integral to employee\nhealth, productivity, and engagement. Organizations that show interest in\nemployee and workplace wellness make employees feel cared for. Here\u2019s what\ncompanies can offer:\n\n### **i) Tests to measure stress levels**\n\n  \n[Workplace stress](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/decreasing-\nworkplace-stress-advice-from-tech-leaders/) is no small matter, and everyone\nwho works in an organization big or small can vouch for that. In addition,\nthere have been numerous studies on the impact of stress on physical and\nmental health. Organizations can deploy stress tests to help employees\nidentify and then manage their stress levels.\n\nWe spoke to Zeynep Ilgaz, CEO of [Confirm\nBioSciences](https://www.confirmbiosciences.com/products/healthconfirm-health-\nand-wellness-test/), a company that offers corporate health screening\nsolutions, about their new offering. HealthConfirm\u00ae tests help assess the\nstress levels of employees.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns that arise from workplace health screenings is the\nprivacy of the findings. Ilgaz confirms that they keep employee privacy at the\ntop of mind when administering these tests.\n\n\u201cThe tests are conducted at home and sent directly into the lab. Employees\nhave sole access to and retain control of their data, and all individual data\nremains anonymous,\u201d she assures. \u201cWhile employers are not able to see\nindividual results, HealthConfirm\u2019s aggregated wellness data provides unique\ninsights into the overall health of a company or given department, so\nexecutives can move forward in customizing their health and wellness programs\naccordingly.\u201d\n\nThis two-pronged approach to employee wellness helps both employees and\norganizations, allowing them to take appropriate measures where applicable.\nWhen organizations get insights into employees\u2019 stress levels, it empowers\nemployees to initiate the conversation about how the company can help them\nmanage their stress levels. Reducing the number of hours worked or offering\nflexible work options can significantly simplify employees\u2019 lives.\n\n### **ii) Benefits platforms that simplify benefits communications**\n\n  \nThere is often a gap between the benefits offered to employees and the\nbenefits they are aware of. [Benefits\ncommunication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-\nadministration/6-ways-technology-can-help-effective-benefits-communication/)\nis a challenge, and using platforms that offer a consolidated view of what is\navailable can help bridge this gap.\n\nPlatforms like MaestroEDGE by [Maestro Health](https://www.maestrohealth.com/)\nallow HR to choose wellness benefits most suitable for their employees. In\naddition, it keeps communication about benefits transparent.\n\nNancy Reardon, Chief Strategy and Product Officer at Maestro Health, tells us\nin an exclusive conversation, \u201cMaestroEDGE offers continual and simplified\ncommunication to make sure employees are engaged and informed about their\nbenefits as early and as accurately as possible. We integrate technology,\nservices, and on-staff registered nurse coaches to engage with the workforce\nand catch at-risk employees before they have costly claims. This level of\nreal-time communication support establishes transparency and support in\nnavigating the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nAdvanced healthcare facilities accessed through a benefits platform can help\nemployees feel cared for and give them that extra motivation to perform even\nbetter at work. And when needed, it can give them exact insights into the\nbenefits they are eligible for, saving time and consequently, simplifying\ntheir lives.\n\n### **iii) Workplace wellness that extends to employees\u2019 children**\n\n  \nWorking parents tend to experience a different kind of stress. And with soon-\nto-be/new mothers, the challenges are more pronounced as they struggle to\ncreate a balance between work, their own health, and the health of their\nchild.\n\n[March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/index.aspx), the leading\nnonprofit for the health of moms and babies, in July 2019, announced a new\ninitiative for employee health called [Healthy Babies, Healthy\nBusiness](https://www.marchofdimes.org/professionals/healthy-babies-healthy-\nbusiness.aspx)\u00ae. This program is designed to help employers support their\nemployees before, during, and after pregnancy.\n\nThis platform offers resources to and a forum for working mothers, where they\ncan find information about health during pregnancy and share their own\nexperiences with other working to-be moms.\n\n[Mercer\u2019s Global Talent Trends 2019](https://www.mercer.com/our-\nthinking/career/global-talent-hr-trends.html#contactForm) states that women\nvalue health benefits more than men do. By catering to this need, you can\nsimplify your female employees\u2019 lives significantly, reducing the additional\nstress that arises from pregnancy and associated health concerns. You will\nalso secure the loyalty of your female workforce \u2013 including those in\nleadership positions \u2013 and keep your most prized talent engaged.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Value of Comprehensive Benefits for Small\nBusinesses**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-\nadministration/the-value-of-comprehensive-benefits-for-small-businesses/)\n\n## **3\\. Provide Insights to Simplify Commuting**\n\nCommuting takes up a lot of time for a lot of employees. So, wouldn\u2019t a tool\nthat offers them insights into what the traffic situation is at any given time\nhelp them plan their commute better?\n\nEnter [TransitScreen](https://transitscreen.com/products/transitscreen), a\nsmart city solution designed for companies to do just that. TransitScreen\nprovides location-based up-to-the-second information on the availability of\nUbers, dockless bikes, public transport, and corporate shuttles.\n\nHow does this simplify your employees\u2019 lives? It gives employees the\nopportunity to plan their work and their commute to the second, allowing them\nto create time for their other endeavors. This includes spending time with\ntheir families or focusing more on their personal health.\n\nMatt Caywood, CEO of TransitScreen, in a conversation with us, said,\n\u201cCompanies that use TransitScreen have found that employees are able to easily\nknow which options are coming and if there are any delays they should be aware\nof, meaning they aren\u2019t as frustrated overall during their commute. This also\nallows employers to showcase other offerings, like private shuttles \u2013 examples\ninclude the World Bank, LinkedIn, Amazon, Reebok, and McDonald's. This can be\nparticularly helpful for companies who have recently moved offices and are\ntrying to retain existing employees, such as Reebok or McDonalds.\u201d\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employees Are Looking for More: How to Meet Heightened\nBenefits Expectations**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-\nadministration/employees-are-looking-for-more-how-to-meet-heightened-benefits-\nexpectations/)\n\n## **What Unique Employee Benefits Are You Offering This Year?**\n\nThe Mercer report referenced earlier also found that low or declining employee\nengagement was second in the list of concerns among those surveyed.\n\nWhile unique employee benefits can contribute significantly to employee\nengagement, do remember that high [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/) is the result of a well-planned strategy that\nencompasses all the drivers of engagement, such as learning and development,\ncareer-pathing and leadership planning, and good management.\n\nHaving said that, focus on the benefit of offering meaningful workplace\nbenefits to your employees. For instance, Ilgaz affirms that: \u201cThe benefits of\nimplementing a data-driven health and wellness program are plentiful, but a\nfew notable advantages include increased employee engagement and productivity,\nbecoming equipped with strong decision-making skills based off actionable\ndata, increased two-way communication and meaningful conversations regarding\nreal workplace issues, and more efficient wellness program spend.\u201d\n\nSo when deploying new benefits for employees, keep a few things in mind:\n\n  1. Ensure that your employees engage with the benefits you offer them. Communicate all the benefits available and check in regularly to see if they use the benefits. \n  2. [Measure employee engagement ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/hr-experts-on-how-to-measure-employee-engagement/)metrics before and after you roll out any unique employee benefit to check how they are doing.\n  3. Be strategic about the benefits you offer.

Since its\nfounding, Neil has grown Corestream into the leading HR technology platform\nprovider for voluntary benefits, managing voluntary benefits deductions for\nover 1.5 million employees and working with Fortune 500 companies including\nADP, CVS, L3, Pfizer and Quest Diagnostics. Prior to founding Corestream, Neil\ninstalled and managed voluntary benefits solutions for international\norganizations including Citigroup, GlaxoSmithKline, Applebee's, and Wachovia.\nNeil graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurship and Finance from\nBabson College.\n\nWe\u2019re working on getting more articles from this author!\n\nWe\u2019re working on getting more articles from this author!\n\n![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/close-button.png)\n\n![Top HR Predictions for\n2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/top_hr_predictions_for_2020_5e42ce0500358.jpg)\n\n_**As a new decade takes shape, companies will be looking at new technologies\nand trends to keep up with the changing HR market. In this article, we look at\nfive trends Neil Vaswani, CEO and Co-Founder of Corestream predicts will take\ncenter stage in the voluntary benefits space in 2020.**_\n\nIn 2019, we\u2019ve seen voluntary benefits like pet insurance and student loan\nrefinancing grow more popular and I believe that trend will accelerate as we\nbegin the next decade, especially as millennial and Gen Z employees continue\nto upend the workforce.\n\nBelow are five trends I believe will be at the forefront of the very dynamic\nvoluntary benefits industry in 2020.\n\n1\\. **It\u2019ll be about the money (as usual).** The state of the economy will be\nfront and center, especially as we go into a presidential election year.\nVoluntary employee benefits with a financial focus will become increasingly\npopular as individuals seek to strengthen their financial condition. The cost\nof public college rises each year, and unfortunately, student loan debt is\naccelerating at an unprecedented rate. According to\n[debt.org](https://www.debt.org/students/), total student loan debt today is\nan estimated $1.4 trillion - and that only keeps rising. For many employees,\nlow-cost loans and student loan refinancing options are voluntary benefits\nthat provide great relief. Their offerings enable employees to access\nliquidity and cash, allowing them to avoid alternatives like predatory lending\nvehicles.\n\n2\\. **Pets will likely be family in more ways than one.** With more\nmillennials choosing to raise pets than have children, pet insurance will\nclimb as one of the most popular and widely requested voluntary benefits in\n2020. In fact, [a recent study from Global Market\nInsights](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2019/10/14/1928923/0/en/Pet-Insurance-Market-value-to-hit-10-billion-\nby-2025-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html) shows the pet insurance market value\nwill likely hit $10 billion by 2025. The reason for this? If your pet gets\ninto an accident or acquires a severe illness, pet insurance could mean the\ndifference between a $600 bill and a $7,000 bill.\n\n3\\. **The Amazon model is coming for benefits too.** As benefits are\nincreasingly offered in an eCommerce or online marketplace model, more\ninsurance brokers will work with HR tech platforms to dodge disintermediation\nand better serve their client companies. Brokers and tech platforms working\ntogether creates a win-win scenario and here\u2019s why: Introducing more products\ngives employees more options and better access to a vast array of benefits\nwhile simultaneously creating more revenue for the broker. Employees,\nespecially millennials and Gen Z, are tech-savvy and very resourceful when it\ncomes to finding information and making decisions. The idea of a marketplace\nfor benefits, where employees have the information and freedom to choose plans\npersonalized for their lifestyles, will become part of the HR process in a\nbigger way very soon.\n\n4\\. **We\u2019ll see the \u201chuman\u201d put back in HR.** Employers, especially at the\nexecutive level, will realize the value of greater employee engagement. HR -\nnot \u201cemployee comms\u201d - will become the leading source and channel for this\nincreased engagement. Transparency and frequency is going to be very important\nin 2020 for employees to feel comfortable communicating with HR about\nanything, including benefits.\n\n**Learn More:[The Elusive ROI of Financial\nWellness](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/the-\nelusive-roi-of-financial-wellness/)**\n\n5\\. **Benefits will be one way employers show they \u201cget\u201d their employees.**\nMore and more employers will experiment with different benefit strategies to\ncreate a more holistic experience for employees that goes beyond their medical\nwellbeing, offering so-called lifestyle benefits to demonstrate an\nunderstanding of the employee\u2019s needs inside and outside the workplace. [The\nunemployment rate has dipped to 3.5%](http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-\nemployment/national-employment-monthly-update.aspx), matching a half-century\nlow. With today\u2019s workforce more empowered than ever, the need to show support\nfor the employee makes a big difference in the ability to attract and retain\ntop talent.\n\nIn 2020, the variety of voluntary benefits will continue to rise alongside\nincreasing adoption rates.

In fact, when Human Resources Online asked HR leaders to rate the\nimportance of employee health and wellbeing on a scale of one to 10, we\nreceived an average rating of nine.\n\nBut, today, health and wellness goes beyond physical wellbeing. It also\ninvolves mental, financial, career, and social aspects.\n\nMohamad Roslan Bin Mohamad Nasir, Senior General Manager \u2013 Corporate, Denso\nMalaysia, reveals that his company, the supplier of advanced automotive\ntechnology, systems and components, is in the midst of planning for a full\nemployee wellness package.\n\n\u201cThe management is very supportive to embark on employee health and\nwellbeing,\u201d he said. Even though the firm is still at the benchmarking stage\nof the programme, Denso has various employee engagement initiatives that aid\nin staff wellness. For instance, a stress management programme for mental\nwellbeing and a consistent sports programme that helps with physical wellness.\n\nFor career and social wellness, the firm has a strong engagement programme\nthat looks at employee career movement within the company, and regionally, as\nwell as CSR programmes related to sustainable development. With many more\nelements of wellness to consider, in the following pages, we uncover how\norganisations are designing truly holistic wellbeing programmes through a\nseries of case studies.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-icon-\noffshore-is-achieving-employee-wellbeing-by-doing-more-with-less/): How Icon\nOffshore is doing more with less\n\nOn a scale of one to 10, employee wellbeing is a 10 for offshore support\nvessel provider, Icon Offshore. Despite being faced with financial constraints\ndue to a slowdown in the oil and gas industry, when it comes to health and\nwellness programmes, Kamarunnihar Abdul Samad, General Manager, Human\nResources, Icon Offshore, reveals a holistic view is taken.\n\nWhile Icon Offshore does not tick all five boxes of mental, physical,\nfinancial, career, and social, the initiatives it has introduced are very\ninterlinked, combining two or more aspects of wellness.\n\n> ##### With the slowdown in the oil and gas sector in recent years, with all\n> our staff activities, we are trying to do more with less.\n\nFor instance, to encourage financial wellbeing, a financial talk was held in\nJuly 2019 where staff were given practical financial advice and were able to\nask questions.\n\n\u201cBecause of the overall downturn in the global oil and gas sector, we are\nunable to pay very competitive salaries. So, we embarked on this talk to help\nour staff by giving them someone who can advise them on how best they can save\nfor the future.\u201d\n\nThe HR team is also working on a talk on how to prevent falling victim to\nfraud, which will be launched in Q3 2019.\n\nApart from improving financial wellbeing, the talks also help with mental\nwellbeing, she says, noting that \u201cif a person has issues with their finances,\nit\u2019s probably going to affect their mental health as well\u201d.\n\nThe initiative she is most proud of is the staff activities, which include\nindoor and outdoor games that not only get staff moving, but also provides an\nopportunity for them to socialise within the organisation.\n\n> ##### The outdoor games include badminton, futsal, and walk-a-hunt \u2013 a\n> treasure hunt that involves walking around town. While the indoor games\n> include charades, darts, and board games such as Scrabble.\n\n\u201cFor these games, the staff are divided into three groups. Each group has\nabout 20 to 25 people and includes a number of departments, a gender balance,\nand various levels. Even the big boss has to play. We encourage the younger\nstaff to be the leaders of the group so we can share leadership advice with\nthem informally,\u201d she says.\n\nThe first time the games were rolled out 2017, a town hall was held to explain\nto employees how the games would work. The second time, a general announcement\nwas made and the team leaders were contacted to disseminate the information.\n\nTo encourage participation, the game rules are that each person has to play at\nleast one game. Otherwise, points will be deducted from the team. At the end\nof the set of games, the winning team will get a monetary reward which they\ncan use to buy lunch or something else for each team member.\n\nWhile the returns on wellness are difficult to quantify, Kamarunnihar has a\npositive anecdote to share.\n\n> ##### The first time the games were introduced, two people actually changed\n> their mind about resigning, despite being offered a much higher salary at\n> the other organisation. When I asked why, they shared that the activities\n> had helped them feel like the company (here) is a family and that they might\n> not get the same experience there.\n\nThe number one thing HR should keep in mind when implementing such programmes?\n\u201cSafety is always number one.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-fostering-an-\nenvironment-that-prioritises-wellbeing-at-aberdeen-standard-investments/):\nFostering an environment that prioritises wellbeing at Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments (Asia) is fully committed to providing employees\nwith a work environment that supports their overall wellbeing.\n\nTay Kheng-Guet, Head of Human Resources \u2013 Asia Pacific, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments, says: \u201cWe have a corporate wellness strategy which is part of the\nAPAC HR strategy on diversity and inclusion. The strategy emphasises fostering\na work environment that prioritises employee wellbeing, valuing diversity, as\nwell as building inclusion and social engagement. Broadening the perspective\nof wellness, there is also a talent and career development strategy which\nguides the development of employees.\u201d\n\nThe APAC strategy has three prongs which include workplace support initiatives\nthat aim to protect employees\u2019 holistic wellbeing in the midst of changes and\nchallenges through three aspects:\n\n  * Agile working and flexible work arrangements which provide employees with flexible autonomy, allowing them to work smarter and more efficiently, which helps them to achieve a work-life balance.\n  * Work-life coaches (employee assistance programmes) which is a confidential service aimed at assisting employees on issues that are work-related, personal, legal, financial, as well as in transitions. Employees can have access to five work-life coaching sessions per year across 10 APAC locations. Coaches can support the diverse language requirements in all locations as well.\n  * Wellness initiatives that go beyond the usual health screenings.\n\nOn the wellness initiatives, Tay says:\n\n> ##### We have a comprehensive wellness calendar in place for the whole year\n> \u2013 covering monthly talks and activities in accordance with quarterly themes\n> of heart (emotional wellness), mind (personal effectiveness), body (physical\n> wellness) and spirit (mental wellness).\n\nApart from the monthly activities, on 31 July 2019, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments held its inaugural ASI Health & Wellness Day where a whole day was\ndedicated to celebrating employees\u2019 wellbeing. Activities for the event\nincluded terrarium building, ergonomics awareness, aromatherapy sessions, and\nmass yoga conducted across three countries.\n\n\u201cThe event is a summer interns-led wellness project aimed at supporting our\nongoing effort to promote health and wellness. Our goal is to encourage all\nemployees to prioritise and take charge of their health amid their busy\nschedules and achieve a work-life balance.\u201d\n\nA variety of activities were planned to educate and cater to individuals\u2019\ninterests and needs \u2013 from an ergonomics talk addressing the importance of\nproper posture in alleviating common aches and pains resulting from prolonged\nsitting, to a yoga hour to help employees achieve mental wellness through\nmindful meditation.\n\n\u201cWe also had a terrarium-making workshop with MINDS to reduce stress and\nsharpen mental focus; as well as an aromatherapy session to help employees\nunderstand the tremendous benefits in helping one to relax and improve their\nmood,\u201d she adds.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-british-\namerican-tobacco-singapore-reduced-absenteeism-by-23/): How British American\nTobacco Singapore empowers staff to take charge of their wellbeing\n\nHaving been established for more than a century, British American Tobacco\n(BAT) is well-known for taking care of employee welfare. It constantly\nmeasures itself against the market and adapts practices to cater to employees\nthrough time and demographic-relevant solutions.\n\nMausami Arora, Head of HR, British American Tobacco Singapore, says: \u201cAt BAT\nSingapore, we are very diverse, with 24 nationalities, a multi-generational\nworkforce and functional breadth. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a\nholistic approach centred around our employees that has both buy-in and\nimpact.\u201d\n\n> ##### We take employee feedback very seriously and we continue to push the\n> envelope to make BAT Singapore a great place to work.\n\nThe organisation has a spectrum of programmes covering the five key aspects of\nwellness. This includes workshops to raise awareness on mental wellness and\nstress management, as well as those focused on savings and retirement\nplanning.\n\nApart from the mental and financial aspects, on the social front, BAT has an\nemployee-led and run sports and social committee which organises events such\nas Family Day, Durian Day, Sports Day, Dinner and Dance, and more. For the\ncareer aspect, the firm strongly believes in growth from within and invests\nheavily in employee development across all grades.\n\nFalling largely under the physical area of wellness, BAT launched an Active360\nhealth and wellness programme in January 2019. The programme seeks to appeal\nto different generations, empower them to take charge of their wellbeing\nthrough various preventive initiatives, and encourage a healthy lifestyle\namong employees.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind this new programme, Arora says: \u201cWhen we\nanalysed our inpatient and outpatient data, we realised the trend was\nreflective of national health concerns around hypertension, diabetes and\ncholesterol. We tend to spend 75% of our waking hours at work and there is a\nconstant blurring between work and life. Hence, at BAT Singapore, we wanted to\ncreate a preventive culture of health and wellness.\u201d\n\nAfter obtaining buy-in from top management and senior stakeholders, the health\nand wellness programme was rolled out with a wellness party to coincide with\nthe launch of the National Corporate Steps Challenge, Season 4.\n\n> ##### An activity plan for the entire year was mapped out, with weekly\n> recurring activities that are relatable, meaningful, impactful, and\n> amplifying.\n\n\u201cActivities include Yoghurt Mondays, Fruity Tuesdays, Salad Wednesdays and De-\nStress Thursdays which are intended to continuously engage the employees and\nraise awareness on healthy eating and mental wellbeing.\u201d In the middle of the\nyear, BAT followed up with a super healthy buffet day where employees were\nable to sample healthy and delicious dishes during lunch.\n\n\u201cA role model was also appointed to share how she achieved her desired weight\nand BMI by persevering with healthy eating habits. Overall, the event was very\nwell-received, and we got lots of positive feedback from the employees.\u201d\n\nTo measure programme success, BAT monitors the emerging trends across medical\nbills, absenteeism, health & safety, employee engagement scores, and employee\nuptake ratios.\n\n> ##### We are already seeing some early success, with absenteeism dropping by\n> 23% to date in 2019 versus the same period last year.\n\nRather than focusing on fixed targets which may end up killing the programme\nin its infancy, BAT looks to create a culture where employees are empowered to\nmake conscious choices towards their health goals, she concludes.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-taiyo-\nnippon-sanso-holdings-singapore-reduces-work-related-stress/): How Taiyo\nNippon Sanso Holdings Singapore reduces work-related stress\n\nWhile employee health and wellbeing is typically considered HR\u2019s\nresponsibility, the responsibility is shared between HR and the business at\nindustrial gas manufacturer, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore.\n\nWith health and wellbeing being an underlying foundation for an effective\ntalent management strategy at the firm, Pauline Loo, Vice President, Human\nResource & Admin, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore, says: \u201cIt is a shared\nresponsibility between HR professionals and business leaders to actively\nengage employees in a holistic manner, going beyond physical wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe organisation has a plethora of initiatives covering the five aspects of\nwellness. In the area of physical wellness, it has the health and wellness\nclub (H&W) which started in April 2018. Comprising employee representatives\nfrom various divisions, including engineering and HR, the club rolls out\nmonthly health and wellness activities ranging from badminton sessions to\nbowling sessions, and even ice-skating sessions.\n\n> ##### \u201cThis year, starting from July and ending in September, for a period\n> of three months, the H&W club organised sports tournaments for our\n> employees,\u201d Loo adds.\n\nIn the area of financial wellness, as part of its HR Cares \u2013 Keep Our People\nInteractive quarterly seminar, speakers are invited to speak with employees on\nvarious wealth education series, ranging from will-writing to lasting power\nattorney.\n\nOn the social front, the company leverages on its Unity in Diversity campaign\nwhich started on 8 August 2018. The firm identified its first Unity in\nDiversity ambassador to promote D&I in social activities within the company\nand among the group\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cA Unity in Diversity video was produced in June 2019 to showcase the spirit\nof embracing unity despite differences between the Japan head office and the\nSingapore regional headquarters. We are also working on a Unity in Diversity\nvideo for the Southeast Asia region.\u201d\n\nIn the area of career wellness, it has implemented two competency models \u2013 the\nManaging Self and Leading Others model and a Human Resource competency model.\nThe two models were designed and developed from April 2019 to ensure\nconsistent talent management practices across Southeast Asia, and India. \u201cThis\nhelps integrate talent practices, for example, ensuring that rewards are tied\nto performance, and performance is tied to development.\u201d\n\n> ##### To ensure mental wellness, one of the 10 core general competencies in\n> the Managing Self and Leading Others competency model is around time and\n> stress management.\n\n\u201cIncorporating \u2018time and stress management\u2019 as one of the ten core general\ncompetencies helps create awareness among the employees that effective time\nmanagement enables them to deliver their work assignments in an efficient\nmanner and reduce unnecessary work-related stress. \u201cIn this way, the employees\nmanage themselves better in terms of striking a better work-life balance and\noverall mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Loo shares that time and stress management was the first core general\ncompetency shared with employees in the inaugural run of HR Cares Brown Bag\nseminars.\n\nAsked about measuring the ROI on wellness, Loo reveals she plans to measure it\nthrough employee engagement analytics.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-fave-\nkeeps-employee-health-wellness-in-check/): A range of wellness activities at\nFave\n\nWhile online-to-offline commerce platform Fave does not have special\ninitiatives parked under each aspect of wellness, the organisation organises a\nrange of activities, says Anisha Sasheendran, Regional Head of People, Fave.\n\nTo promote physical wellness, the firm organises post-work exercise classes\nthroughout the week.\n\n> ##### \u201cWe have Yoga Mondays, Futsal Tuesdays, Badminton Wednesdays, and\n> Zumba Thursdays. We also have free health checks and talks from time to\n> time,\u201d she says.\n\nOn the financial front, with the average age of Fave\u2019s employees being 27,\nmany are interested in wealth and financial management, she observes. In line\nwith that, the organisation hosts talks and workshops with external partners\nfrom time to time.\n\nIn an effort to support employees\u2019 mental wellness, while Fave does not have\nexperts within the company, it provides contacts to organisations/ experts\nthat are trained to help individuals who need assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have also given time off to some employees that were pre-\ndiagnosed/diagnosed with some sort of mental condition. This really helped\nthem rejuvenate. Some are back now and doing great stuff within the\norganisation.\u201d\n\n> ##### On the career front, Fave has mentorship programmes, internal job\n> rotation opportunities, and one-to-one career chats for employees who are\n> keen to know more about their career growth.\n\nTo provide opportunities for employees to socialise, Fave has various social\nevents in and out of the office which employees are occasionally able to bring\ntheir family and friends to attend.\n\nApart from that, she says: \u201cWe host external events at the office and\nencourage our employees to attend networking and external sessions outside the\noffice as well. We also established a learning fund which employees can use to\nlearn something new \u2013 from attending conferences abroad to even taking a\nKorean class.\u201d\n\nThe initiatives are communicated to staff via Fave\u2019s monthly/quarterly all-\nhands sessions as well as via email, and effectiveness is gauged through pulse\nsurvey scores.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-urbanfoxs-\nbroad-spectrum-of-health-and-wellness-initiatives/): UrbanFox\u2019s broad spectrum\nof health and wellness initiatives\n\nEmployee wellbeing is of utmost importance to UrbanFox, a B2B2C logistics\nenabler that is a subsidiary of Keppel Logistics.\n\n**Abeline Kok, HR Team Lead at UrbanFox** , shares that the organisation\nundertakes a broad spectrum of health and wellness initiatives to support the\nphysical, mental, financial, career, and social wellbeing of its employees.\n\nOn the physical aspect, she says: \u201cWe have mobile massages for our employees\nat least once a month. Employees register for the massages; each session lasts\nabout 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n> ##### The massages are also part of UrbanFox\u2019s CSR efforts as the firm\n> engages the mobile massage team from the Singapore Association of the\n> Visually Handicapped.\n\nOther initiatives for physical wellness include high intensity interval\ntraining workshops once to twice a month, and complimentary health screenings\nfor employees.\n\nOn the mental aspect, UrbanFox organises lunchtime talks on mental wellness,\nas well holds staff engagement sessions.\n\n\u201cThe engagement sessions support mental wellbeing by providing employees with\na platform for them to share their feelings and provide feedback.\u201d\n\nIn addition, lunchtime talks are also held to promote financial wellness.\nTopics for the talks include personal financial planning as well as sharing on\nCPF and MediSave policies and schemes.\n\nTo ensure career wellness, UrbanFox has career discussions with high potential\nemployees. \u201cDuring these sessions, we will discuss their career goals,\u201d Kok\nsays. She adds that mentors are also assigned to high potentials.\n\nElaborating on other employee development and growth initiatives, she notes:\n\n> ##### We work with Workforce Singapore to conduct skills profiling workshops\n> for our employees. We also have quarterly appraisals where supervisors speak\n> to teams about their performance and careers.\n\nOn the social front, UrbanFox has a plethora of initiatives to encourage staff\nbonding. The firm organises family day events, festive celebrations, as well\nas team building sessions every year.\n\n\u201cWe also have activities which are staff-initiated. Employees with similar\ninterests will create a chat group on Google Hangouts and organise get-\ntogether sessions. We have chat groups for bowling, rock climbing, board\ngaming, KTV, and more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe initiative under the social umbrella which she is most proud of, is the\nFoxlympics, a sports and games event that runs across the entire year. The\ninitiative started in 2018 and is now in its second run.\n\nIt comprises competitions in foosball, table tennis, darts, Jenga, and\nScrabble. Staff are grouped into divisions which compete against each other.\nEach division will consist of a few departments to facilitate inter-department\ninteractions. At the end of the year, a trophy will be given to the division\nwith the most points.\n\n> ##### Senior management is supportive because it sees that sports and games\n> contribute to the physical and mental wellness of the employees.\n\nIn addition, bonds between colleagues have strengthened over the friendly\ncompetitions.\n\n\u201cThe turnout for the event has been good and there has been positive feedback\nthrough various channels, including employee surveys and monthly round tables\nwith the Managing Director. We also encourage staff to share feedback on\nGlassdoor. Since it is anonymous, the feedback should be pretty honest,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10115352/HRSG-Sep-Oct-2019-Health-Wellness-feature-\ninfographic.jpg)\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources\u2019 September-October 2019\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine._\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/03161518/hrsg_sep-oct19.jpg)\n\n_Photos / provided  \nImage/ [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/)_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

The same proportion (22%) of employees also rated the current support\nas poor.\n\nWhen it came to support for stress, while 43% agreed that existing support is\nadequate, even more employees (37%) rated access to direct support as poor.\nSimilarly, about a third (34%) of employees rated their company's current\nmental health support as poor.\n\nA different picture was painted when HR directors and employers were surveyed,\nwith almost two thirds (60%) of HR directors rating the availability of health\nand wellness benefits as good, highlighting the gap in perception between HR\nand employees.\n\nFurther, a majority of employers (68%) felt that enough is being done to\nsupport stressed employees and only 12% of employers rated access to direct\nsupport for stress as poor. Similarly, only 18% of employers rated the\ncompany's current mental health support as poor.\n\nDerek Goldberg, Managing Director of Aetna International, APAC, said: \"We are\nseeing a clear gap emerging both globally and in Singapore between the level\nof corporate health and wellness support that businesses believe they are\nproviding, and the perceptions of their workforces. This misalignment may be\nhaving an impact on employee well-being and business productivity.\"\n\n### Employees in Singapore most concerned about stress and mental health\n\nWhen asked about their concerns regarding their future health, stress was\nranked as their top concern, with 88% of employees indicating some level of\nconcern that it could one day impact their ability to work.\n\nThis was followed by mental health issues (85%), and serious physical\nillnesses such as cancer (84%).\n\nThe same top three concerns extended to the physical and mental health of a\nclose family member, with 87% of employees believing that family ill health\ncould impact their ability to work.\n\nSignificantly, two-thirds (67%) of workers stated that they would not join a\ncompany if it did not have a clear policy on supporting those with mental\nhealth issues, including stress, anxiety or depression, reflecting the\npriorities of today's jobseekers.\n\n### A key benefit Singaporean employees want is flexible working hours\n\nOf the benefits and policies employees felt will help improve their health and\nwell-being, flexible working hours is cited as the top benefit by 65% of\nworkers. Yet only 13% of HR directors believe this benefit has a positive\nimpact on employee attraction and retention.\n\nApart from flexible working hours, employees cited stress reduction programmes\nand services as their second preferred benefit (45%), followed by access to\ngym at work (44%).\n\nOverall, a comprehensive health package was seen to have the biggest positive\nimpact on the ability to attract (32%) and retain (33%) employees by\nbusinesses, outside of salary and job role specifics. This is followed by:\n\nEmployee recruitment:\n\n  * Annual leave entitlement (27%)\n  * Flexible working policies (10%)\n  * Geographical location (8%)\n  * Positive work culture (6%)\n\nEmployee retention:\n\n  * Annual leave entitlement (20%)\n  * Flexible working policies (13%)\n  * Geographical location (4%)\n  * Positive work culture (9%)\n\nGoldberg said: \"Offering tailored health and wellness benefits and support in\nthe workplace are becoming as vital as policies around sick leave, major\nillnesses and holiday time. Data from this report indicates that Singapore-\nbased companies can benefit from reviewing their current corporate well-being\nprogrammes, and doing more to better understand the needs of their evolving\nworkforces.\n\n\"In supporting a future-ready economy, it is imperative that we look beyond\nthe physical well-being, and emphasise the importance of a healthy mental and\nemotional state of mind. By giving employees the tools to be successful in\nachieving their well-being goals, organisations stand to benefit from improved\nperformance and ensure that they\u2019re equipped to keep pace with tomorrow\u2019s\ndemands.\"\n\n**Other findings from Aetna International 's report were: **\n\n  * Over half (54%) of employees thought they don\u2019t get enough sleep. While the average number of hours of sleep per night is 7.3 hours, this reduces to 5.3 hours for quality sleep.\n  * The top five reasons employees were not getting enough sleep are job stress (34%), long working hours (30%), usage of electronics in bed (24%), financial concerns (21%), and not doing enough exercise (19%).\n  * 74% of HR directors thought it difficult to keep benefits packages current.\n  * 40% of HR directors were unsure of what employees want from the company.\n  * 44% of HR directors were concerned about the cost implications of employee health and wellness.\n  * 71% of HR directors felt they are increasingly expected to do more with less time.\n  * 91% of HR directors believe that compliance with new laws and regulation is an ongoing challenge.\n\n_Photo /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/sg)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

This year's results were [presented in a\nseries of online reports](https://shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-\nforecasting/research-and-surveys/Pages/Benefits19.aspx).\n\nEnsuring Health  \n\nEighty-six percent of employers that responded to the survey believe health-\nrelated benefits are very important or extremely important to their workforce,\nwhich may explain why only 3 percent have reported a decrease in these\nbenefits, the survey revealed. But with health care costs continuing to\noutpace general inflation\u2014and with the estimated cost of employer-sponsored\nhealth benefits [approaching $15,000 per employee](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/pages/employers-adjust-health-benefits-\nfor-2019.aspx)\u2014employers remain cautious about spending in this area.\n\nAmong survey respondents:\n\n  * 20 percent indicated that their organizations' health-related benefits have become more generous in the last 12 months.  \n\n  * 70 percent indicated that their health benefits have stayed the same.\n\nThis year, 20 percent of respondents offered one health care plan, while the\nmajority (79 percent) offered two or more types of health care plans to\nemployees. Many employers have opted to offer a high-deductible health plan\n(HDHP)\u2014either linked or not to a health savings account (HSA) or health\nreimbursement arrangement (HRA)\u2014instead of a traditional health plan or as an\nadditional choice.\n\nPreferred provider origanzation (PPO) plans continue to be the most popular\nhealth insurance option, available in 85 percent of organizations, followed by\nHDHPs linked to an HSA or HRA, available in 59 percent of organizations.\nOfferings of high-deductible health plans that are not linked with an HSA or\nHRA decreased by 10 percentage points since last year.  \n\n(Click on graphics to view in a separate window.)\n\n[![2019 EB - health plans.jpg](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20health%20plans.jpg)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_health_plans_bh1t2j?_ga=2.236108225.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n\"As the cost of health care continues to rise, employers will likely need to\nkeep a close eye on the plans they are making available to employees to ensure\nthey are offering their workforce what is most needed without breaking their\nbudget,\" said SHRM Chief Knowledge Officer Alexander Alonso, SHRM-SCP.  \n\n\u201cHealth care costs are eating up a good portion of employer benefits budgets,\nso employers aren\u2019t choosing to make many new changes,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s\nreally about incorporating the higher health care costs and doing what you can\nwith the rest of your benefits budget to meet employees\u2019 needs.\u201d  \n\n[![2019 EB - health accounts - 2.png](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20health%20accounts%20-%202.png)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_health_accounts_tzr1hr?_ga=2.231985631.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n  \n\nTelemedicine (or telehealth) is one of the fastest-growing health care\nbenefits, the survey showed. Telemedicine increased by 10 percentage points\nwithin the past year, and grew from 23 percent in 2016 to 72 percent this\nyear.  \n\n[ ![2019 EB - telemedicine-2.jpg](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20telemedicine-2.jpg)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_telemedicine_wy0asw?_ga=2.205166800.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\nKeeping Fit  \n\nIn general, 64 percent of organizations that responded to the survey offer\nemployees wellness resources, programs and events. The largest increase in any\nwellness benefit over the past five years has been the purchase of standing\ndesks. Five years ago, only a quarter of employers that participated in the\nSHRM survey offered them. Now, 60 percent of respondents said they provide or\nsubsidize the cost of switching from a sitting desk to a standing desk.  \n\nFitness programs are a popular benefit. Around one-third of organizations are\nproviding benefits\u2014whether onsite or offsite, through a center, a class, a\nsubsidy or reimbursement for fitness center fees\u2014to help support employees'\nphysical well-being. Offsite offerings remain slightly more common (32\npercent) than onsite (29 percent).\n\nRewards or bonuses for completing certain health and wellness programs were\noffered by 38 percent of organizations this year and have been paid by between\n38 percent and 41 percent of respondents since 2015.\n\nAlthough the survey showed a decline in preventive programs specifically\ntargeting employees with chronic health conditions, dropping to 24 percent of\nrespondents, down from 40 percent in 2015, there\u2019s a possible explanation for\nthe falloff. \"More insurers now integrate chronic disease management into\ntheir health plan services,\" so employers may not need to provide disease\nmanagement as a separate benefit, said Liz Supinsky, SHRM\u2019s director of\nresearch products.\n\nSaving and Investing  \n\nNearly all of the employers surveyed offer employees one or more retirement\nplans to help them save for their financial future. Defined contribution plans\nremain the most common; 93 percent offer a traditional 401(k) or similar plan\n(with contributions in pretax dollars and withdrawals taxed during retirement)\nand 59 percent offer an optional Roth 401(k) or similar plan (with\ncontributions in after-tax dollars and withdrawals tax-free during\nretirement.)  \n\n[ ![2019 EB - retirement plans-2.jpg](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20retirement%20plans-2.jpg)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_retirement_plans_ob7hcr?_ga=2.209443282.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n\"Every single 401(k) plan should have a Roth option\" because for most plan\nparticipants tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals during retirement will\nmore than offset contributions made with after-tax dollars, said Jeanne\nFisher, senior 401(k) advisor at ARGI Financial Group in Bowling Green, Ky.\nAdding a Roth account feature \"doesn't cost anything beyond the cost of a plan\namendment,\" Fisher noted, during a presentation at the 2019 SHRM annual\nconference.  \n\nEmployer matches for 401(k) plans held steady, with about 75 percent of\nsurveyed organizations offering a match over the past five years.  \n\nAutomatic features, requiring employees to affirmatively opt out of plan\nenrollment or contribution increases, are more common. The survey found that\nthis year:\n\n  * 42 percent of organizations **automatically enrolled new employees** into a defined contribution plan, up from 38 percent last year.  \n\n  * 22 percent **automatically enrolled current employees** who were not participating in the plan, up from 20 percent.  \n\n  * 19 percent **automatically escalated employees' salary deferral contributions** , up from 18 percent.\n\n\"Design enhancements that leverage behavioral finance insights such as\nautomatic enrollment, coupled with generous employer-matching contributions,\nare helping build a more financially secure retirement for American workers,\"\nsaid Hattie Greenan, director of research and communications at the Plan\nSponsor Council of America, an association of benefit plan sponsors.  \n\nHowever, \"auto enrollment without auto escalation is a double-edged sword,\"\nsaid Fisher, because automatic enrollment default savings rates are commonly 3\npercent to 6 percent of employees' pay\u2014\"significantly lower than what the\naverage American needs to be saving for retirement,\" which is typically at\nleast 10 percent to 15 percent of pay throughout their careers, and often 20\npercent or more if employees have delayed saving for retirement.  \n\nAnother key component of financial fitness is advice about money matters. This\nyear, the survey showed that:\n\n  * 57 percent of respondents offered **retirement planning or investment advice** to employees online, in a group classroom or one-on-one.  \n\n  * 36 percent offered **nonretirement financial advice**.  \n\n  * 18 percent offered **credit counseling services**.  \n\n_[SHRM members-only toolkit : _ [ _Designing and Managing Flexible Benefits\n(Cafeteria) Plans_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/managingflexiblebenefitsplans.aspx) _]_\n\nPaying Off Student Loans\n\nEmployer-provided student loan repayment as a benefit has doubled since 2018\nfrom 4 percent to 8 percent.  \n\n[ ![2019 Student loan graph.png](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20Student%20loan%20graph.png)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_student_loans_lan1ih?_ga=2.139645171.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n  \n\n\"As of December 2018, more than 44.7 million borrowers owed $1.5 trillion in\nstudent loans\u2014a sum that exceeds the gross domestic product of all but a dozen\ncountries around the globe,\" Alonso said. \"In a competitive labor market,\nstudent loan repayments can be a valuable tool to recruit highly qualified\ncandidates and to keep talented employees.\"\n\nSHRM's director of policy engagement, Chatrane Birbal, explained, \"While more\nemployers could offer student loan debt repayment as a benefit, an obstacle is\nthat the payments are considered taxable income for the recipients, and\nemployers can't claim a deduction for these payments.\"\n\nIn February, members of Congress reintroduced the Employer Participation in\nRepayment Act, which would let employers give tax-free student loan assistance\nof up to $5,250 a year per employee\u2014the same amount that Section 127 of the\nU.S. tax code now treats as tax-exempt for employer-provided tuition\nassistance. SHRM supports enacting this legislation.\n\nIn an indication of how shielding benefits from taxes might affect employers'\nwillingness to offer them, more than half of the survey respondents (56\npercent) provide tax-free tuition assistance to employees, up from 51 percent\nlast year.  \n\nTaking Time Off\n\nThe vast majority\u2014over 90 percent\u2014of respondents offer some type of paid leave\nto employees. In 2019, most organizations are doing this through a paid-time-\noff bank that combines both vacation and sick-leave time.  \n\nEmployers continue to offer generous paid leave for new parents, with about a\nthird (34 percent) of organizations offering paid leave to mothers and\nslightly fewer (30 percent) to fathers.  \n\n[![2019 EB - paid leave-2.png](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20paid%20leave-2.png)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_paid_parental_leave_cqyln8?_ga=2.40538466.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\nOne organization in five reported offering family leave, paid or unpaid,\nbeyond what is required by both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and\nstate mandates.\n\n\"Organizations with workforces made up primarily of adults under 40, or those\nlooking to recruit greater numbers of younger workers, will likely see even\nstronger pushes for paid parental and family leave,\" said Alonso.\n\nAs remote work becomes more popular, telecommuting is increasing.  \n\n[![2019 EB - telecommuting-2.jpg](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20telecommuting-2.jpg)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_telecommuting_impn5r?_ga=2.238664896.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n  \n\nOther benefits promoting work/life balance, including compressed and four-day\nworkweeks, saw minor increases in 2019. \"With heavy workloads, long and\nunpredictable work hours and limited time with family and friends, alternative\nschedules could be an attractive option,\" Alonso said.  \n\nPhasing Retirements  \n\n**I** nformal phased retirement programs are now offered by 15 percent of\nrespondents, up from 10 percent in 2015, while formal phased retirement\nprograms fell to 6 percent, down from 8 percent. over the same period  \n\nOne reason employers are more likely to offer informal programs is that they\n[prefer to limit phased retirement opportunities to high-\nperformers](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/phased-retirement-\nchallenges.aspx) and those with in-demand skills, and believe that an ad hoc\napproach makes that easier.\n\nAn informal approach, however, could pose legal issues regarding\nnondiscrimination based on who is offered the right to shift to part time,\nalthough this hasn't been tested in the courts, benefits advisors have noted.  \n\nBeing Family-Friendly\n\nAs organizations look to recruit and retain younger workers, HR leaders are\nexpanding other benefits for new parents. For example, more employers are\nproviding lactation or mothers' rooms for breastfeeding, which are separate\nareas that go beyond Affordable Care Act requirements that employees be\n\"shielded from view\" and \"free from intrusion\" during their breaks. Support\nservices, such as lactation consulting and education, have also been\nincreasingly offered, although shipping breast milk home for mothers who are\non business travel hasn't yet become mainstream.  \n\n[ ![2019 EB - lacation-2.png](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/PublishingImages/Pages/employers-boost-benefits-to-win-and-\nkeep-\ntalent/2019%20EB%20-%20lacation-2.png)](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/v1/Benefits/2019_SHRM_-\n_lacation_benefits_yu9rr9?_ga=2.140565618.1915223933.1561641390-632952977.1507689615)  \n\n\"Dignified lactation spaces and the cultural support needed to continue\nbreastfeeding after maternity leave is still a challenge for the majority of\nworking women,\" said Sascha Mayer, CEO and co-founder of Mamava, the inventor\nof the first lactation pod and expert in lactation space design.  \n\nDeclining Partner Benefits  \n\nSince a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalized same-sex marriages in all\n50 states, there has been a [decline in offering benefits to employees'\nunmarried partners](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/domestic-\npartner-benefits-poll.aspx). Many employers had offered partner benefits as a\nway to treat all employees equally when in many states same-sex marriage was\nnot recognized. Having offered benefits to the same-sex partners of employees,\nmany felt it was only fair to do the same for unmarried opposite-sex partners.\n\nThis year, 10 percent of survey respondents offered domestic partner benefits\nother than heatlh care to same-sex or to opposite-sex partners, down from 15\npercent last year.\n\nAmong the reasons some organizations have given for continuing to offer\ndomestic partner benefits is a desire to recognize all types of families.  \n\n  \n\n|\n\n**Benefits : What's Hot and What's Not**\n\nFrom 2015 through 2019, many employers added or dropped the following\nbenefits.*  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Benefits on the Rise** \u2191\n\n|\n\n**Benefits on the Decline** \u2193  \n  \n**Telecommuting, on an ad hoc basis** (from 56% to 69%)  \n|  **Mail-order prescription program** (from 87% to 78%)  \n  \n**Standing desks** (from 25% to 60%)  \n|  **Chiropractic coverage** (from 81% to 75%)  \n  \n**Flextime during core business hours** (from 52% to 57%)  \n|  **Long-term disability insurance** (from 80% to 71%)  \n  \n**Health savings accounts** (from 43% to 56%)  \n|  **Short-term disability insurance** (from 74% to 61%)  \n  \n**Onsite lactation rooms** (from 35% to 51%)  \n|  **Dependent care flexible spending accounts** (from 66% to 59%)  \n  \n**Part-time Telecommuting** (from 36% to 42%)  \n|  **Health fairs** (from 40% to 33%)  \n  \n**Paid maternity leave** (from 21% to 34%)  \n|  **Onsite health screening, e.g., glucose and cholesterol tests** (from 43%\nto 31%)  \n  \n**Paid personal leave** **separate from vacation or sick leave** (from 27% to\n32%)  \n|  **Accident insurance** (from 51% to 27%)  \n  \n**Health insurance premium discount for participating in wellness programs\n**(from 25% to 31%)  \n|  **Laser-based vision correction coverage** (from 30% to 24%)  \n  \n**Paid paternity leave **(from 17% to 30%)  \n|  **Domestic partner benefits for same-sex partners** (from 17% to 10%)  \n  \n**Informal phased retirement programs** (from 10% to 15%)  \n|  **Domestic partner benefits for opposite-sex partners** (from 16% to 10%)  \n  \n**Onsite stress-management programs** (from 5% to 13%)  \n|  **Company-provided fitness bands/activity trackers** (from 13% to 8%)  \n  \n**On-ramping programs for parents re-entering the workforce** (from 2% to 12%)  \n|  **Formal phased retirement programs** (from 8% to 6%)  \n  \n**Elder care referral services** (from 6% to 10%)  \n|  **Indemnity health plans** (from 9% to 5%)  \n  \n**Student loan repayment assistance** (from 3% to 8%)  \n|  **Defined benefit cash balance plans** (from 8% to 5%)  \n  \n  \n|  \n  \n  \n*Only benefits that the survey has tracked for the past five years are listed.  \nSource: Society for Human Resource Management, 2019 Employee Benefits survey.  \n  \n  \n\nBeing Socially Conscious\n\nEmployer-provided charitable donations are down over the past five years, but\nmore than one-quarter of organizations now provide paid time off for\nvolunteering to meet the demands of workers who value corporate social\nresponsibility.\n\nOffering the Right Benefits Mix\n\nCompanies are conducting extensive research on their specific employee\ndemographic to find a unique benefits package that resonates with the majority\nof their employees\u2019 needs and stage of life.\n\n\u201cFinding the right combination of benefits that appeals to a multigenerational\nworkforce can be a challenge,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cBut if you know a good portion of\nyour workforce are Baby Boomers with aging parents, you might choose to beef\nup your caregiving benefits and flexible scheduling policies.

The study noted that between 2003 and 2013, more\nthan 70% of the Fortune 1000 companies changed and were replaced by nimbler\nfirms.\n\nMost HR executives or chief people officers, or CPOs, will need to reskill to\nstay relevant \u2014 and do so quickly, according to [_HR People +\nStrategy_](https://www.hrps.org/pages/default.aspx), the group\u2019s network of\nbusiness and thought leaders in human resources.\n\n\u201cAs the pace of innovation and technology in the workplace accelerates, CPOs\nwill need to reinvent themselves,\u201d says the study\u2019s co-author Suzanne\nMcAndrew, the global head of talent of Willis Towers Watson. \u201cWith disruption\non the horizon, organizations will require strong, visionary people leaders\nwho can think through the people and talent strategy, and work with management\non the business strategy.\u201d\n\nMost executives \u201care not prepared,\u201d McAndrew says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only going to get things done if we have the right people, the right\ntalent in the right functions with the right goals,\u201d Upwork CEO Stephanie\nKasriel says in the study. \u201cThat to me is the role of HR, to ensure that we\nhave the right people strategy in order to inform the business strategy.\u201d\n\nThe study reviewed key changes shaping HR functions for human resources\nleaders and also found:  \n\n  * Virtually all respondents (99%) believe HR executives must have the agility and courage to change, yet only 35% said today\u2019s leaders are prepared to respond.\n  * More than nine in 10 respondents (94%) say it\u2019s important to explore the development of future HR leaders, but only about a third (35%) agree that future staff are receiving the training they\u2019ll need to succeed. \n  * Only one-third of respondents (36%) are prepared to think about how technology can be used to execute work in the future; only a quarter (26%) say they have the technical acumen to evaluate new technologies.\n\nHR leaders can do five things to help drive change, including acting as an\nadvocate for change and agility, developing digital technology to improve HR\nfunctions, using automation to foster new skills and reinvention for staff,\nfocusing on workplace culture and leadership and elevating HR decision-making\nto include more analytics, the study found.  \nAlexander Alonso, chief knowledge officer at SHRM, noted that HR executives\nhave the greatest potential to foster the evolution of enterprises by building\nup their own expertise to meet future workforce demands.\n\nRespondents also recognize much progress is still needed with digital\nenablement and understanding how to apply digital technology and automation in\nthe workplace. Only 42% had a favorable opinion of their organization\u2019s\nprogress when it comes to embracing technology that builds a consumer\nexperience for employees.\n\n\u201cWhile CPOs don\u2019t need to be technology experts, they must understand how\nchanging technology can impact work and the workforce,\u201d says Ravin Jesuthasan,\na managing director at Willis Towers Watson and co-author of the study.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a93dd1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/196x196+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F42%2F49%2F55fd155c4b7f8e3675188de5bf6d%2Fdownload.jpg)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/walden-siew)\n\n[Walden

According to a 2019 medical trends report, in 2018, Asia saw\nmedical costs increase by an average of 10.4% \u2013 compared to the global average\nof 9.7%. What\u2019s more, the report, which surveyed 204 insurers across 59\ncountries, predicted a similar increase for 2019.\n\nAs the cost of health benefit programmes continues to rise globally, employers\nhave the opportunity to contain costs through smarter plan designs, and\nproviding employees with access to quality-focused healthcare. In line with\nthis, and with the rising costs of healthcare, many companies have found that\nprevention (that is, keeping staff healthy) is cheaper than cure (that is,\nhealing them when they\u2019re sick).\n\nAt the [HR Vendors of the Year\n2019](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-2019/),\n[Singapore](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/), the\nwinning companies in the Best Employee Insurance Provider category have\nproducts/services that help reduce spend on doctors and hospitals, while\ncurbing the cost of absenteeism and low productivity by more than the cost of\nprevention; with the end result of keeping clients\u2019 workforces healthy.\n\n### [**Best Employee Insurance Providers \u2013\nSingapore**](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/)\n\n**Winners:** **  \nGold:** AIA Singapore  \n**Silver:** FWD Singapore  \n**Bronze:** Howden Insurance Brokers\n\n* * *\n\n_**Want to know more about HR Vendors of the Year awards?**_\n\n  * _View all winners across[Malaysia](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/winners-and-photos-hr-vendors-of-the-year-2019-malaysia/) and [Singapore](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/winners-and-photos-hr-vendors-of-the-year-2019-singapore/)_\n  * _Photo gallery of the awards dinners held in[Malaysia](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-my-2019/post-event-gallery) and [Singapore](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/post-event-gallery)_\n  * _To participate in the 2020 awards or find out more, email:[event.info@humanresourcesonline.net](mailto:event.info@humanresourcesonline.net)_\n\n_Lead photo / HR Vendors of the Year 2019, Singapore_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.
