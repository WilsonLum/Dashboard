Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nBusiness intelligence and analytics go hand in hand. By leveraging big data,\ncompanies have managed to make more efficient systems, develop better customer\nexperience and create more opportunities to increase their bottom line.\n\nOne of the more overlooked applications of big data is the generation of\ninsights for HR teams. However, companies are coming around to the reality\nthat skillful use of analytics can help their HR teams be more effective in\nfinding and onboarding talent. These 11 experts from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) delve into what their companies have\ndone to implement workforce analytics to help their HR departments be more in\ntune with the organization\u2019s employees.\n\nMembers explain why HR teams can benefit from studying their workforce\nanalytics.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Tracking Employee Engagement** ** **\n\nOur company uses a platform called Rhonda. Rhonda allows us to check in weekly\nwith our employees via text messages. Employees are able to rate their weekly\nexperiences. The managers are held accountable to check in with employees if\nthe employee scores low on their weekly work experience. It is invaluable to\nhave information in real time, open a dialogue and stop problems before they\nblossom. - [Patricia Sharkey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciasharkey/),[\nIMI People](http://www.imipeople.com/)\n\n**2\\. Measuring The Impact Of Learning**\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of training programs has always been a challenge.\nWe know[ 96% of L&D managers](https://leolearning.com/app/uploads/2019/02/LEO-\nLearning-Measuring-the-Business-Impact-Of-Learning-2019-Results.pdf) say they\nwant to measure learning impact, it\u2019s just that L&D and HR simply haven\u2019t had\naccess to the data to do it until now. Today, it\u2019s finally possible with the\nright technology, like machine learning, to gather the depth and dimension of\ndata to tie the impact of learning to business results. - [Andrea\nVrbanac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-vrbanac-chrl-2861ba53/),[ Axonify\nInc](http://www.axonify.com/)\n\n**3\\. Identifying The Optimal Path Forward**\n\nWith talent and organization high on the C-suite's agenda, using metrics and\ndashboards produced by organizational analytics enables HR leaders to be more\nresponsive to the business. It also allows them to deploy internal human\ncapital consulting teams whose members can be flexibly assigned to critical\nprojects that affect that business's organizational health. -[ Claudy\nJules](https://twitter.com/claudy-jules-ph-d-7939a3108),[\nGoogle](http://google.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Preventing Workplace Misconduct**\n\nInvestigations and employee behavioral data can hold the key to anticipating\nand fighting issues like sexual harassment and bias. Indicators on where\nemployee issues are occurring, what kind of issues are being reported, the\nnumbers of cases and more can be analyzed to predict trends, drive strategic\nplans and take preventative action across an organization. - [Deborah\nMuller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiemuller/),[ HR\nAcuity](http://www.hracuity.com/)\n\n**5\\. Identifying Red Flags**\n\nIf you collect data on a consistent basis (e.g. monthly people reviews) and\nask the right questions of your people managers, you will be able to identify\nred flags. This will help determine if you have employees who are struggling,\nflight risks or negatively impacting the team. - [Jeff\nBuenrostro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbuenrostro/),[ Metric\nTheory](http://www.metrictheory.com/)\n\n**6\\. Determining The Right Employee Benefits**\n\nOne area where workforce analytics really shine is the area of employee\nbenefits, employers' second largest expense after payroll. Understanding the\nutilization trends and correlating them with the employee churn data can help\nprovide insights into what benefits employees resonate with the most and\nallows employers to adjust toward more optimal experience to drive employee\nrecruitment and retention. -[ Rachel\nLyubovitzky](https://twitter.com/rlyubovitzky),[\nEverythingBenefits](http://www.everythingbenefits.com/)\n\n**7\\. Addressing Knowledge Gaps**\n\nWhen properly leveraging the power of people analytics, big data can help with\ninternal resource allocation, properly identify employee performance metrics,\nand assist with organizational and team culture. Addressing process\nbottlenecks or knowledge gaps that lead to employee disengagement, burnout and\nturnover can help HR teams build a stronger culture while creating lasting\nvalue. - [Erald Minga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eraldminga/), [Kellogg\nSchool of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)\n\n**8\\. Determining Upskilling Needs**\n\nMany employers struggle to find workers who possess the skills their roles\nrequire, resulting in unfilled positions and lost revenue. By leveraging big\ndata, employers can determine the roles their growing business will require in\nthe near future, and the skills necessary to succeed in those roles, allowing\nthem to offer training to current employees in advance and minimize future\nhiring costs. -[ John Feldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**9\\. Becoming Better Business Partners**\n\nWorkforce analytics can help HR become true business partners and gain a \"seat\nat the table.\" It allows HR to align data with people solutions that will help\nthe company thrive because better people strategies equal greater customer\nsatisfaction and higher revenues. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n**10\\. Improving Process Efficiency**\n\nHR wears many hats, and executives can't always see the connection between\nprograms. Utilizing metrics helps drive stronger performance, show ROI and get\nfurther buy-in for ongoing programs. Let's take process efficiency metrics for\nexample. Look at each step in the hiring process to determine what's broken,\nwhat pages are applicants dropping off, and then use that data to improve\ncompletion rate. -[ Nicole Smartt Serres](https://twitter.com/Nicole_Smartt),[\nStar Staffing](http://www.starhr.com/)\n\n**11\\. Helping Build High-Performing Organizations**\n\nIn a workday, there are myriad touch points between ourselves, others,\nfacilities, etc., which helps understand how we interact within the workplace\nand enables us to tailor better experiences. Data helps solve everyday\nproblems about engagement, hiring or behaviors/shifts in culture. Benefits\ninclude environments in which people can thrive and more effective, high-\nperforming organizations. - [Drew\nCarter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewc/),[ H.

In a\nworld where drowning in information is easier than actually pinpointing the\ndata we need, Priya Sunil covers all stages of the people analytics journey\nthrough conversations with leaders who walk the analytics talk.**\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the one-liner about numbers hiding as much as\nthey reveal, I\u2019m hoping you haven\u2019t heard this one yet: \u201cStatistics is the art\nof never having to say you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Perhaps the one-liner has some truth to\nit, as decisions today have become impossible without the right data.\n\nIn a world where information is easy to access, and in fact, available in a\ndeluge, having the right data at your fingertips is the difference between a\nslow and uncertain decision versus a prompt and 90%-sure decision.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, people analytics has become a hot topic among industry\nleaders today, with more businesses recognising the need for this approach.\nWherever you are in your people analytics journey \u2013 be it in the awareness\nstage, the early stage of implementation, or at the later stage where you\u2019re\nlooking to revamp your existing model \u2013 this feature is for you.\n\nThrough conversations with leaders who walk the talk in the industry, this\nfeature delves into the key questions you may have such as, does people\nanalytics need a big team? Not necessarily, as you\u2019ll learn through a chat\nwith **Daniel Kusmanto, ASM\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics**. What challenges can\nyou anticipate in the process? **Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and\nProjects, Brenntag Asia Pacific** , tells us. But before all that, what do you\nneed to first ask yourself before embarking on this journey, or revamping it?\nWe find out from **Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay**.\n\n**How people analytics turns data into meaningful insights**\n\n**_Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay, believes before implementing a\npeople analytics model, leaders need to ask the \u2018why\u2019 before working on the\n\u2018what\u2019. He shares his take on how companies are taking this approach today, in\nan interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nHaving the right talent gives companies a competitive advantage. Much of the\nresearch on what worries CEOs is around having the right talent in the\norganisation and the skills to do critical jobs. If so, then getting the right\ntalent, managing and engaging them will have a massive impact on companies\u2019\nability to not only do well and grow, but to also sustain for the long term.\n\nEvery decision around people becomes important, especially when we think about\nthe constant challenge around acquiring the best people for your organisation.\nA lot of decisions we make on people are based on data and facts \u2013 so, the\nbetter we get at decisions based on insights, the better the outcomes.\n\nIf people are a company\u2019s biggest asset, then companies need to make sure what\nthey do will have the best impact on both the company and their employees.\n\nThe adoption of people analytics arises from **the need to do what is right\nfor the business and its people** ; **increase fairness and transparency** ;\nand **looking at factors and variables that sometimes we, as humans, normally\ndo not think about or appreciate**.\n\n> ##### After all, if we base our business decisions on business analytics,\n> why shouldn\u2019t we make people decisions based on people analytics?\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ntend to face?**\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all. Each company is unique and in different stages\nof maturity in its journey. While there are some standard analytics models\nthat I think every company should look at, I do believe that each company must\nevaluate what kind of insights it needs to drive business performance through\nits talent, that is, the kind of talent management problems they have and what\nthe key HR challenges are. The analytics model and framework need to then\nensure they are meeting these needs.\n\nThere are two fundamental challenges that can come your way. First, the\n**availability and accuracy of data**. If we think about the availability of\ndata, we assume that companies have data but, what about the quality of data?\nIf the data going in is poor, incomplete and inaccurate, you cannot expect\ndeep insights to come out of it.\n\nSecond is **technology and the expertise to convert this data into insights**.\nWe have plenty of amazing tools and technology now that allow you to convert\nmassive data sets into easy-to-understand visual tools. Thus, if you don\u2019t\nhave people with expertise in understanding data and technology, it will be a\nstruggle. That is why you see this exponential increase in demand for data\nscientists and engineers, and numerous companies now coming up with analytics\ntools, given the high demand for such tools.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\n**My first advice is to ask yourself this: What exactly am I looking to solve\nthrough the use of people analytics?** There is no point in having a very\nfancy framework that gives 100 amazing visual reports if you don\u2019t know how\nthese reports will solve your business and HR challenges. Companies need to\nlink the business strategy to the HR strategy, identify the issues, and then\nsee what kind of data and insights will help them solve those.\n\n> ##### You cannot solve all problems through data, but you can still get a\n> lot out of it. The analytics approach has to be proactive rather than\n> reactive.\n\nYou also need to **ask the \u2018why\u2019 before you work on the \u2018what\u2019**. Get people\nwho understand data and can help create meaningful insights from the millions\nof data points.\n\nBased on my personal experience, you can look at one data set in a variety of\nways, which allows room for creativity \u2013 this field is not limited by any\nmeans. Ultimately, regardless of what model you choose, it must lead back to\nthe original challenge you are trying to solve.\n\nLast, as this is an evolving field, more technology and tools mean more data\nis created. **You need a framework that allows companies to constantly\nmonitor, adapt and evolve their analytics capability and reach**. What works\nnow will not work in two years\u2019 time, even in how companies are thinking\nthrough their approach and constantly linking their analytics models to solve\nbusiness and people challenges.\n\n* * *\n\n**People, process, and system: ASM\u2019s three pillars to a successful people\nanalytics transformation journey**\n\n**_At the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit\nby bit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the\n\u2018aha\u2019 moments daily, affirms Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR\nAnalytics, in this interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\nASM, a supplier of semiconductor process equipment for wafer processing,\nfounded in the Netherlands, believes in the importance of starting right. So\nwhen it started a people analytics team in 2017, the team comprised just one\nfull- time person \u2013 Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics.\nWhy? He explains: \u201cThere are companies that come in with a big bang; you\u2019ll\nsuddenly see in the newspaper they hired a head, and a bunch of analysts. But\nat ASM, we believe people analytics is more like a transformation journey that\ngrows organically. It\u2019s a bit hard when you\u2019ve started off big, and then you\nkeep measuring the ROI. You might even lose the idea of people analytics being\na journey and not a destination. After all, it is always good to travel light\nfor a long journey, right?\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, it is never easy to start off something that transforms the way\ndecisions about people are made in an organisation. In line with that, he\nhighlights the three key pillars of transformation \u2013 people, process, and\nsystem, emphasising the importance of HR and IT collaborating towards a common\nvision and moving forward as one in the analytics journey. \u201cWithout this\nalignment, it is an uphill battle to make progress.\u201d\n\nOn this journey, people are the hardest to transform. How was this challenge\ntackled? \u201cAs in marketing, we started off by segregating our target population\nand transforming them progressively, starting with the HRBPs who were\nconsidered one of the most important allies and important stakeholders that\ncan bring data and analytics to the discussion table with senior business\nleaders.\u201d\n\n> ##### In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should become more\n> like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and recognising\n> opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe next equally important segment is the HR leadership team,\nfollowing which, we should move beyond HR to people managers and eventually\nall employees.\u201d In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should\nbecome more like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and\nrecognising opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the midst of a casual talk or regular meeting with\ncolleagues, they may mention an issue they are facing \u2013 it can be in retaining\ntalent, recruitment or compensation. In these instances, it\u2019s important to\nidentify any opportunity where people analytics can help with. Something where\ndata can give them an insight into what is happening and what they can\npossibly do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit by\nbit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the \u2018aha\u2019\nmoments daily.\u201d Overall, he shares the transformation journey and the growth\nof people analytics at ASM has been \u201cquite successful\u201d and that although ROI\nis yet to be established in dollar-terms, there is still an impact on the\nbusiness. \u201cLooking back at where we started with HR data still scattered and\nnot much opportunities to retrieve insights, to today, where the results of\npeople analytics are being discussed at the highest level in the organisation,\nthus triggering cross- department initiatives \u2013 it is indeed great progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is quick to point out the firm is \u201cnot there yet\u201d. In fact, he\nbelieves there are many more uncharted territories in the organisation where\npeople analytics can play a more significant role, such as workforce planning,\norganisational effectiveness, and so on.\n\nMoving forward, he emphasises that people analytics leaders, as disruptors to\nHR\u2019s traditional way of working, are being disrupted as well by ready-made\nanalytics capabilities that come with HR technology platforms.\n\n\u201cHence, we need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\nbusiness knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down a\ngeneric business question on people (e.g. if we have more headcount, why are\nthe machines still producing the same amount and how can we boost this?) to\nmany granular questions that, in the end, can be answered (perhaps not at 100%\nconfidence and it will be in terms of probability) with people data and\nanalytics.\u201d\n\n> ##### We need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\n> business knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down\n> a generic business question on people\n\n* * *\n\n**How to create enriching career conversations through data**\n\n**_For Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and Projects, Brenntag Asia\nPacific, people analytics is about the ability to gather and combine data to\ntell meaningful stories and gain insights about a specific situation and about\npeople. He shares more in this short interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nThe needs vary, and include: boosting sales revenue; penetrating a new market;\nstudying customer buying trends; measuring customer satisfaction levels;\nenhancing the current supply chain and distribution network; hiring and\ndeveloping talent; succession planning; career management; reducing staff\nattrition; driving performance and company culture, and engaging a\nmultigenerational workforce.\n\nAt Google, for instance, the firm\u2019s Project Oxygen uses people analytics to\nuncover the practices of its best managers and provides coaching sessions for\nlow performers. While at Dell, analytics is used to increase the success of\nits sales force.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) uses people analytics to\nidentify the traits of great managers, and leverages that for their\ndevelopment. RBC also uses internal and customer data to diagnose reasons for\nthe performing and non-performing branches, regions or product innovation.\n\nBack home, Singapore is investing in becoming a SMART nation. The key pillars\nto support this are a digital economy, digital government, and digital\nsociety. Our people, our companies and our public agencies all have a role to\nplay in this transformation by becoming a value-creating nation going forward,\nversus a value-adding one.\n\nOverall, it is about the ability to gather and combine data to tell meaningful\nstories and gain insights about a specific situation and about people, while\nallowing you to plan interventions that will solve key organisational\nchallenges and, ultimately, drive business outcomes.\n\n**Q Based on your experience across industries, what key factors form the\nbasis of each industry\u2019s needs?**\n\nPeople make things happen. It is an opportunity to create self-awareness for\nthe organisation and employees around people analytics and what it can do for\nthem, and, in doing so, engage them to play their part. It is also about\nunderstanding and gaining insights, for example, about people\u2019s behaviours,\nforecasting trends and predicting events for better decision-making, to name\nsome.\n\nUnderstanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\nconversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations. This is\nstrategic in developing talent initiatives to achieve organisational goals,\nengaging the hearts and minds of employees, and building that ultimate\nemployee experience that promotes the company brand.\n\n> ##### Understanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\n> conversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations.\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ncome across?**\n\nThe first challenge lies in combining accurate and clean data from various\nsystems, in order to mine valuable insights and interpretation of the\nemployee\u2019s behaviour and journey. Another challenge is in ensuring sound\ngovernance around how the data is processed, used and kept with compliance to\nthe local data security and privacy policy.\n\nIn my view, the next challenge is around building understanding and commitment\nto change as part of the communication strategy and change management.\nFinally, the challenge also lies in developing the competencies and skills of\nthe HR professionals and employees who use the data to support decision-\nmaking.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\nFirms intending to embark on this rewarding and exciting journey are advised\nto begin with a road map. Asking the right questions will lead to actionable\ninsights, while setting a vision with clear goals provides clarity of\ndirection about what you want to achieve. Organisations should also be able to\nidentify the support required and assemble the team members who are passionate\nabout analytics.\n\nIn managing the expectations and communicating the need for change, HR is\npresented with an opportunity to diagnose, and build understanding and\ncommitment to change for the organisation. First, begin with one or two key\ninitiatives that will solve key organisational challenges and witness the ROI\nin the journey to get buy-in, and establish credibility in the process.\n\nFurther, firms who wish to revamp their existing people analytics model are\nadvised to look critically at what areas have worked well, what has not, and\nwhat can be stopped. The important takeaways are, overall, the rich lessons\nlearnt as an organisation, as a team and as an individual through the\nexperience. This will provide guidance in the road map for the next phase of\nyour people analytics journey.\n\nWe are living in a data-driven economy. Data is now readily available,\ncomplemented by many tools being developed in the market to boost analytics\ncapabilities and cater to the interest in big data. Progressive companies see\nthe advantage of leveraging people data to make better decisions, managing\npeople at work, and reaping the benefits of implementing a people analytics\nstrategy.\n\n* * *\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources Online\u2019s January-February 2020\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the Malaysia\nmagazine.

process, and system: ASM's three pillars to a successful people\nanalytics transformation journey\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### At the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit\nby bit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the\n\u2018aha\u2019 moments daily, affirms Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR\nAnalytics, in this interview with Priya Sunil.\n\nASM, a supplier of semiconductor process equipment for wafer processing,\nfounded in the Netherlands, believes in the importance of starting right. So\nwhen it started a people analytics team in 2017, the team comprised just one\nfull- time person \u2013 Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics.\nWhy? He explains: \u201cThere are companies that come in with a big bang; you\u2019ll\nsuddenly see in the newspaper they hired a head, and a bunch of analysts. But\nat ASM, we believe people analytics is more like a transformation journey that\ngrows organically. It\u2019s a bit hard when you\u2019ve started off big, and then you\nkeep measuring the ROI. You might even lose the idea of people analytics being\na journey and not a destination. After all, it is always good to travel light\nfor a long journey, right?\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, it is never easy to start off something that transforms the way\ndecisions about people are made in an organisation. In line with that, he\nhighlights the three key pillars of transformation \u2013 people, process, and\nsystem, emphasising the importance of HR and IT collaborating towards a common\nvision and moving forward as one in the analytics journey. \u201cWithout this\nalignment, it is an uphill battle to make progress.\u201d\n\nOn this journey, people are the hardest to transform. How was this challenge\ntackled? \u201cAs in marketing, we started off by segregating our target population\nand transforming them progressively, starting with the HRBPs who were\nconsidered one of the most important allies and important stakeholders that\ncan bring data and analytics to the discussion table with senior business\nleaders.\u201d\n\n> ##### In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should become more\n> like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and recognising\n> opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe next equally important segment is the HR leadership team,\nfollowing which, we should move beyond HR to people managers and eventually\nall employees.\u201d In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should\nbecome more like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and\nrecognising opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the midst of a casual talk or regular meeting with\ncolleagues, they may mention an issue they are facing \u2013 it can be in retaining\ntalent, recruitment or compensation. In these instances, it\u2019s important to\nidentify any opportunity where people analytics can help with. Something where\ndata can give them an insight into what is happening and what they can\npossibly do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit by\nbit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the \u2018aha\u2019\nmoments daily.\u201d Overall, he shares the transformation journey and the growth\nof people analytics at ASM has been \u201cquite successful\u201d and that although ROI\nis yet to be established in dollar-terms, there is still an impact on the\nbusiness. \u201cLooking back at where we started with HR data still scattered and\nnot much opportunities to retrieve insights, to today, where the results of\npeople analytics are being discussed at the highest level in the organisation,\nthus triggering cross- department initiatives \u2013 it is indeed great progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is quick to point out the firm is \u201cnot there yet\u201d. In fact, he\nbelieves there are many more uncharted territories in the organisation where\npeople analytics can play a more significant role, such as workforce planning,\norganisational effectiveness, and so on.\n\nMoving forward, he emphasises that people analytics leaders, as disruptors to\nHR\u2019s traditional way of working, are being disrupted as well by ready-made\nanalytics capabilities that come with HR technology platforms.\n\n\u201cHence, we need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\nbusiness knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down a\ngeneric business question on people (e.g. if we have more headcount, why are\nthe machines still producing the same amount and how can we boost this?) to\nmany granular questions that, in the end, can be answered (perhaps not at 100%\nconfidence and it will be in terms of probability) with people data and\nanalytics.\u201d\n\n> ##### We need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\n> business knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down\n> a generic business question on people\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published as part of a feature in[Human Resources Online\u2019s\nJanuary-February 2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of\nthe Singapore magazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the\nMalaysia magazine.

From\nan HR perspective, professionals continue to struggle with ways to keep their\norganizations successful and their employees engaged.  The reality is tough\ndecisions must be made and will need to be made in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, however, HR has an opportunity to take the crisis and draw\nnew data from it daily.  How is the organization performing?  Are employees\nengaged?  Are they productive?  How is leadership fairing?\n\nIn our recorded interview, the HR Curator himself - Dave Millner-- joins us.\nDuring our discussion, we take a look at the coronavirus and its impact on\nboth the United States and the United Kingdom. Millner also looks into his\n\"crystal ball\" in an attempt to predict what the future of work will look like\nas a result of the pandemic.  Additionally, we discussed data, people\nanalytics and Millner's new book.\n\nWatch the interview below.\n\n_Photo courtesy:   Pexels_\n\n### Co-Contributor\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/dave_millner.jpg)\n\n[ Dave Millner ](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/dave-millner)  \n_Consulting Partner_  \nHR Curator\n\n##  More From Coronavirus and HR [\n__](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/content-hub/coronavirus-and-hr)\n\n[\n\n##### The Coronavirus and HR\u2019s Response\n\n](/employee-engagement/podcasts/the-coronavirus-and-hrs-response)\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode \u2013 the coronavirus and HR\u2019s response to the pandemic.\nThe guest: Akebono Brake...\n\n__ 2020-04-06 _by  [HR Exchange Network Editorial\nTeam](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/hr-exchange-network-\neditorial-team)_\n\n[\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/eric_torigian_1.jpg)\n](/employee-engagement/podcasts/the-coronavirus-and-hrs-response)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n\n##### HR News: 3,000% Increase in 1st Time Jobless Claims\n\n](/hr-talent-management/news/hr-news-3000-increase-in-1st-time-jobless-claims)\n\nThe coronavirus has topped 1 million cases globally and it\u2019s having a terrible\nimpact on companies a...\n\n__ 2020-04-02 _by  [HR Exchange Network Editorial\nTeam](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/hr-exchange-network-\neditorial-team)_\n\n[\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/hr_news_coronavirus_woman-\nwearing-mask-on-train.jpg) ](/hr-talent-management/news/hr-news-3000-increase-\nin-1st-time-jobless-claims)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n\n##### Kris Rides Discusses the HR/Cybersecurity Relationship\n\n](/hr-tech/podcasts/kris-rides-discusses-the-hrcybersecurity-relationship)\n\nThis week, Tiro Security CEO and Founder Kris Rides.

With the rise in AI and machine learning, the job of using\nthese effectively can feel impossible.\n\nIf you are a human resources professional who needs to leverage this kind of\ntechnology to help make better decisions about your organization's people,\ndon't worry: you don't need to be a data scientist to impact your\norganization.\n\nThe real gap in moving people analytics forward lies, not just in getting more\ndata scientists, but in giving the people experts the skills they need to ask\nthe right questions of the data, and then turning those insights into a story\nthat will engage, resonate, and encourage stakeholders to take action.\n\n## **HR Business Partners (HRBPs) as Data Translators**\n\nIt's this reason why, by 2026, the [McKinsey Global\nInstitute](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-\ninsights/analytics-translator) estimates that demand for \"data translators\" in\nthe United States alone may reach two to four million. Translators are not\ndata scientists; instead, they bridge the technical expertise with the\noperational knowledge of marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, risk, and\nother frontline managers.\n\nIn the HR context, this means mapping statistics back to meaningful stories,\nsuch as how turnover impacts innovation, revenue, or customer satisfaction.\nWithin HR, HRBPs are in the perfect position to play this role. Their mandate\nis to work closely with an organization's senior leaders to develop a people\nagenda that firmly supports the overall aims of the organization\u2014my training\non being an active business partner centered on asking the most powerful and\nimpactful questions. As a data translator, we can now more effectively help\nanswer those questions.\n\nAs we have found, successful people analytics adopters have taken an approach\nwhere statistics-heavy specialists will do the intensive part of the research.\nStill, the HRBPs will own the process of highlighting the impactful questions,\nand telling the story to inform and engage stakeholders on the answers.\n\n## **Challenge of Working With Data**\n\nEven though an in-depth knowledge of programming languages and statistics is\nnot necessary, there is still a learning curve for data-aspiring HRBPs. The\nchallenge appears to be two-pronged: technical and strategic.\n\nOn the one hand, HRBPs have not finished the transformation to become more\ncomfortable with metrics and data. While demands for this type of analysis and\ninformation are entering the mainstream, nonetheless, these demands represent\na recent change for the human resources function.\n\nThe other challenge has less to do with numbers and more to do with\nunderstanding the business. \"In my future research on people analytics\nenablement, I spoke with numerous organizations that reported less than 25% of\ntheir HRBPs understood the businesses they support. Instead of providing\nstrategic insight, many HRBPs still operate more as administrative aides to\nthe business and prefer to handle employee relations problems,\" writes [Lexy\nMartin](https://www.visier.com/clarity/secure-the-right-hr-business-partner-\nmanager-for-the-future/), a respected thought leader on HR technology\nadoption.\n\n**Becoming more business and numbers-savvy is no easy feat. But here are some\ntips you can start using today:**\n\n### **Start the Journey**\n\n  \nBecoming savvy in your business is a journey of constant exploration. Markets\nchange, business strategies change, and competitors rise and fall. You cannot\nknow it all nor become an expert overnight. So make having conversations with\na diverse set of business leaders across your organization a priority. Be\ncurious and understand what matters most to them and how people impact their\nsuccess.\n\n### **Measure What Matters**\n\n  \nWhen it comes to being data-driven, you don't need to boil the ocean right\naway. Start by finding something specific (such as turnover) that you care\nabout. Dig deep enough to become an expert on the topic by gaining an\nunderstanding of how the data changes over time, by tenure, for high or low\nperformers. What patterns can you discover in the data?\n\n### **Connect to the Business**\n\n  \nHR leaders know the importance of understanding the business. Oftentimes, not\ngetting that aligned with the data will send you off into a discussion that is\nnot important. Asking the powerful right question is at the heart of being a\ngreat business partner, and working with data is no different. How does\ndiversity impact hiring? How does hiring impact our business? Data on people\ngoes from interesting to business-critical when you can connect people's\ndecisions to business outcomes.\n\n### **Walk Away From the Data**\n\n  \nOne of the top experts in the field of data storytelling is Cole Nussbaumer\nKnaflic. Before becoming the bestselling author of Storytelling With Data, she\nspent over a decade refining her skills through analytical roles in banking,\nprivate equity, and at Google.\n\nSpeaking at Visier Outsmart, a conference for data-driven leaders, Knaflic\ndemonstrated how a story arc forms a bridge from our short term memory to our\nlong term memory.\n\nIt can be challenging to distill the data into a tidy narrative structure. But\nas Knaflic recommends, once the analysis is complete, put all the data aside\nand talk it over with a colleague. Remember that data is evidence, and you\nhave to tell the story to win the case. Stories are how we engage people, and\nin the case of data, you need to act like an investigative journalist - a data\njournalist who tells their story with data.\n\n### **Include \"So That\" in Your Statements**\n\n  \nAlso, during Visier's Outsmart, Dave Ulrich (widely known as the father of\nmodern HR) shared a little trick to ensure you are connecting your insights to\nthe business. If you want business leaders to pay attention, include the\nphrase \"so that\" in reviewing and sharing your story. Business leaders are\nlooking for business impact and asking, \"so that\" forces you to understand and\nexplain the effects. But the phrase also makes people pay closer attention\nbecause conclusions force them to evaluate whether they agree or disagree with\nyour findings. Remember, you are the expert, so share your expertise rather\nthan just the data presented in a strictly factual manner.\n\n**Learn More:[HR in 2020: Reskilling Goes Into\nOverdrive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/hr-\nin-2020-reskilling-goes-into-overdrive/)**\n\n### **Prompt with a Question**\n\n  \nOne of the best ways to contextualize data is to start from the business\nquestion. We use data to help us make better decisions. It is evidence that\ninforms our choices, but without understanding what decision we are making or\nwhat challenges we are facing, you cannot apply the right data to the right\nproblem. The easiest way to make this connection is to start with the right\nquestion.\n\nFor example, when evaluating compensation, there can be many opportunities.\nAre you concerned you are paying above or below the market? Is it impacting\nyour ability to hire? That you are not fostering a pay for performance\nculture? Which question you are focusing on can both narrow the data work, but\njust as importantly, it makes it easy for your audience to participate in the\ndiscussion and decision.\n\nThe demand for people analytics skills is not going away any time soon. Today\nthe HR team is no longer asked to provide data; Instead, it is requested to\nprovide input on what the data means as well as recommendations for\ninterventions. This is only going to continue, as studies have shown that\n\"people analytics\" was one of the fields with the highest increase in expected\nimpact among HR professionals. By empowering HRBPs with data now,\norganizations can be prepared to tackle the future of work head-on.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Engage Generation Z in Workplace Learning &\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nto-engage-generation-z-in-workplace-learning-development/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Transform+HR+Data+Into+Business+Results\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Transform+HR+Data+Into+Business+Results&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Transform HR Data Into Business\nResults&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

Q&A: How people analytics turns data into meaningful insights\n\n[Hong Kong HR

Head of Reward APAC, eBay, believes before implementing a\npeople analytics model, leaders need to ask the \u2018why\u2019 before working on the\n\u2018what\u2019. He shares his take on how companies are taking this approach today, in\nan interview with Priya Sunil._\n\n### Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm's people\nanalytics model?\n\nHaving the right talent gives companies a competitive advantage. Much of the\nresearch on what worries CEOs is around having the right talent in the\norganisation and the skills to do critical jobs. If so, then getting the right\ntalent, managing and engaging them will have a massive impact on companies\u2019\nability to not only do well and grow, but to also sustain for the long term.\n\nEvery decision around people becomes important, especially when we think about\nthe constant challenge around acquiring the best people for your organisation.\nA lot of decisions we make on people are based on data and facts \u2013 so, the\nbetter we get at decisions based on insights, the better the outcomes.\n\nIf people are a company\u2019s biggest asset, then companies need to make sure what\nthey do will have the best impact on both the company and their employees.\n\nThe adoption of people analytics arises from **the need to do what is right\nfor the business and its people** ; **increase fairness and transparency** ;\nand **looking at factors and variables that sometimes we, as humans, normally\ndo not think about or appreciate**.\n\n> ##### After all, if we base our business decisions on business analytics,\n> why shouldn\u2019t we make people decisions based on people analytics?\n\n### Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ntend to face?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all. Each company is unique and in different stages\nof maturity in its journey. While there are some standard analytics models\nthat I think every company should look at, I do believe that each company must\nevaluate what kind of insights it needs to drive business performance through\nits talent, that is, the kind of talent management problems they have and what\nthe key HR challenges are. The analytics model and framework need to then\nensure they are meeting these needs.\n\nThere are two fundamental challenges that can come your way. First, the\n**availability and accuracy of data**. If we think about the availability of\ndata, we assume that companies have data but, what about the quality of data?\nIf the data going in is poor, incomplete and inaccurate, you cannot expect\ndeep insights to come out of it.\n\nSecond is **technology and the expertise to convert this data into insights**.\nWe have plenty of amazing tools and technology now that allow you to convert\nmassive data sets into easy-to-understand visual tools. Thus, if you don\u2019t\nhave people with expertise in understanding data and technology, it will be a\nstruggle. That is why you see this exponential increase in demand for data\nscientists and engineers, and numerous companies now coming up with analytics\ntools, given the high demand for such tools.\n\n### Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?\n\n**My first advice is to ask yourself this: What exactly am I looking to solve\nthrough the use of people analytics?** There is no point in having a very\nfancy framework that gives 100 amazing visual reports if you don\u2019t know how\nthese reports will solve your business and HR challenges. Companies need to\nlink the business strategy to the HR strategy, identify the issues, and then\nsee what kind of data and insights will help them solve those.\n\n> ##### You cannot solve all problems through data, but you can still get a\n> lot out of it. The analytics approach has to be proactive rather than\n> reactive.\n\nYou also need to **ask the \u2018why\u2019 before you work on the \u2018what\u2019**. Get people\nwho understand data and can help create meaningful insights from the millions\nof data points.\n\nBased on my personal experience, you can look at one data set in a variety of\nways, which allows room for creativity \u2013 this field is not limited by any\nmeans. Ultimately, regardless of what model you choose, it must lead back to\nthe original challenge you are trying to solve.\n\nLast, as this is an evolving field, more technology and tools mean more data\nis created. **You need a framework that allows companies to constantly\nmonitor, adapt and evolve their analytics capability and reach**. What works\nnow will not work in two years\u2019 time, even in how companies are thinking\nthrough their approach and constantly linking their analytics models to solve\nbusiness and people challenges.\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published as part of a feature in[Human Resources Online\u2019s\nJanuary-February 2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of\nthe Singapore magazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the\nMalaysia magazine.

For\nmore coverage, see our coronavirus [hub](/coronavirus)_\n\nWHEN THE financial crisis rocked the business world in 2007-09, boardrooms\nturned to corporate finance chiefs. A good CFO could save a company; a bad one\nmight bury it. The covid-19 pandemic presents a different challenge\u2014and\nhighlights the role of another corporate function, often unfairly dismissed as\nsoft. Never before have more firms needed a hard-headed HR boss.\n\nThe duties of chief people officers, as human-resources heads are sometimes\ncalled, look critical right now. They must keep employees healthy; maintain\ntheir morale; oversee a vast remote-working experiment; and, as firms\nretrench, consider whether, when and how to lay workers off. Their in-trays\nare bulging.\n\nOnce derided as \u201cpay and parties\u201d managers, by the early 1990s HR chiefs\nturned to compliance, keeping firms out of the courts (and papers). A\nsubsequent string of corporate imbroglios elevated their status, notes Patrick\nWright of the University of South Carolina. In the wake of executive-pay\nscandals at companies such as WorldCom and Tyco in the 2000s they became more\ninvolved in remuneration. A decade later bungled successions, for example at\nHP, a printer-maker which sacked two bosses in as many years, left them with a\nbigger say in filling top jobs. In the past few years they have dealt with\ncompanies\u2019 often very public \u201cme too\u201d troubles.\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200328_WBC877.png)\n\nAs recruiting and retaining skilled workers became chief executives\u2019 big\npreoccupation\u2014four-fifths now worry about skill shortages, up from half in\n2012\u2014HR heads\u2019 desks moved ever closer to the corner office. Today many reside\nright next to the boss. Shareholders are inviting more outside HR chiefs to\nboards. In America their salaries remain lower than CFOs\u2019 but have risen 20%\nfaster since 2010 (see chart).\n\nA higher profile entails new expectations. HR was once the domain of history\ngraduates and masters in labour relations; nowadays plenty hold business\ndegrees. Although most firms recruit them from HR jobs, more are choosing\noutsiders or unconventional candidates. According to Russell Reynolds\nAssociates, an executive-search firm, HR heads appointed to Fortune 100\ncompanies between 2016 and 2019 were around 50% likelier than earlier hires to\nhave worked abroad, in general management or in finance.\n\nBefore covid-19, tight labour markets and empowered employees pressed\nemployers to understand how to get the most out of their staff, says Dane\nHolmes, a former head of human-capital management at Goldman Sachs, an\ninvestment bank, who now runs an HR-analytics firm. Diane Gherson, who runs HR\nat IBM, overhauled the computing giant\u2019s performance management using big\ndata. Algorithms now challenge IBM managers\u2019 instincts on pay and promotion,\nand alert Ms Gherson\u2019s team when staff are at risk of fleeing (often before\nthey realise it themselves).\n\nThe pandemic makes such \u201cpeople analytics\u201d more relevant. Beth Galetti, Ms\nGherson\u2019s opposite number at Amazon, an engineer with no HR experience before\njoining the e-commerce titan, oversees 1,000 developers working exclusively on\nHR software. Amazon\u2019s pre-outbreak investment in digital induction for fresh\nhires is paying off. \u201cWe on-boarded 1,700 new corporate employees on [March\n16th] alone,\u201d Ms Galetti reports.\n\nCovid-19 may lead more HR chiefs to adopt such systems. In the short run many\nhave more pressing problems. Mala Singh, chief people officer at EA, a maker\nof video games, represents the c-suite on the team tasked with pandemic\nresponse. This now occupies 60-70% of her (long) day. Her team has been\ngetting staff desks, computers, even noise-cancelling headphones. A bigger\nconcern was balancing work with child care. Ms Singh told the caregivers on EA\nstaff to take as much time as they need to adapt without using up paid leave.\nShe is digitally monitoring employee sentiment, particularly anxiety. In a\ncreative business like EA\u2019s, \u201chaving someone stressed about their family\nsituation does not enable productive work\u201d, she explains.\n\nMany companies, especially outside the knowledge economy, face tougher\nchoices. HR leaders must strike a balance between a firm\u2019s professed purpose,\nwhich these days often involves treating staff decently, and the bottom line,\nobserves Dan Kaplan of Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The instinct is to cut costs\nthrough mass redundancies, as some hotel chains, airlines and others have\nbegun doing. Rather than slash payrolls indiscriminately, says Bill Schaninger\nof McKinsey, another consultancy, good HR heads can use the crisis to\nreconfigure company workflow: what needs to be done by whom, what can be\nautomated and what requires people to share the same space. Some workers who\nat first appear redundant may be redeployed or reskilled.\n\nThe most far-sighted HR-ers at the most resilient companies are already\nstarting to look beyond the flattened curve.

The world of work\nhas changed in the last couple of weeks, and companies are navigating new\nchallenges. Nearly everyone, it seems, is embracing \u2014 or at least testing \u2014\nthe future of work.\n\nAs per LinkedIn\u2019s latest report, Global Talent Trends 2020, four trends stand\nout which will reshape the talent hiring and recruitment landscape - the\nemergence of employee experience, the spread of people analytics, the return\nof internal recruiting, and the ascent of the multigenerational workforce.\n\nHowever, these trends are all defined in some measure by their demand for\nempathy \u2014 the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Today,\nmore businesses are grinding gears to understand their talent more deeply than\never before, in order to serve them better. This new focus on empathy is\nencouraging companies to put themselves in their employees\u2019 shoes.\n\n_**Employee experience could be the new HR**_\n\nCompanies are beginning to work for employees, and not just the other way\naround. Today, employee experience (EX) goes beyond what we earlier understood\nto be \u2018employee engagement\u2019. What does it exactly mean? The central idea is to\nactively collaborate with employees to understand their point of view and\ndesign experiences that allow people to do their best work.\n\nAs companies become more employee-centric, they\u2019re creating more \u201cemployee\nexperience\u201d roles. Mature organizations are hiring dedicated EX personnel,\nwhile smaller companies are bypassing \u201cHuman Resources\u201d altogether and\nbranding their people function \u201cEmployee Experience\u201d right out of the gate. In\nfact, the number of LinkedIn members whose current job titles include the\nphrase \u201cemployee experience\u201d has seen a 2.4X increase since 2014. In India,\n95% talent professionals believe that EX will be very important in shaping the\nfuture of HR and recruiting, with 77% of them focused on EX to improve\nretention.\n\n_**Using data to build people-first companies**_\n\nWhile employee experience is quickly becoming the cornerstone of hiring and\nretaining talent, meaningful insights will inform talent decisions at every\nlevel of the recruiting cycle. Therefore, understanding and capitalizing on\npeople analytics is quickly becoming a must-have skill in HR. People analytics\nessentially connects data to effective decision-making. It draws insights from\nhuman behavior to help people and companies perform better. It uses formal\nscientific methods to support empathy. In India, 92% of talent professionals,\nthe highest across the world, believe people analytics will be the future of\nHR.\n\nTalent leaders have understood the value of people analytics for some time, as\nit has promised to revolutionize recruiting and HR for a decade. But until\nrecently, only the most sophisticated companies have reaped the benefits. Now\nwe\u2019re reaching an inflection point where data is accessible to all.\nUnderstanding and capitalizing on analytics is quickly becoming a must-have\nskill in HR.\n\nIn fact, over the past five years, LinkedIn has witnessed a 242% increase in\nHR professionals with data analysis skills. Still, many companies are only at\nthe early stages of developing people analytics functions.\n\nWhether organizations use data to derive workforce insights, chart down career\npaths for employees, improve their day-to-day workplace experience, or\nharmonize different generations - they must remain cognizant of the fact that\ntheir businesses are being run by people. Their existence in, and contribution\nto, every level of the process is the driving force that steers businesses\ntowards success. To fully appreciate the impact people analytics can have,\nit\u2019s helpful to see where companies intend to go. Top growth areas include\nanalyzing competitive intelligence, flight risks, and candidate success.\n\nFor instance, professional services firm Genpact was looking at building a\nteam of high-potential engineers with expertise in building and scaling\nsoftware platforms. To hire such talent, the talent acquisition teams had to\ngo back to the drawing board. Using LinkedIn\u2019s data and insights, the talent\nacquisition teams gave the leadership and hiring managers a clear picture of\ntalent availability in the market, which included specific companies to target\nand compensation benchmarks. Empowered with the right data and insights,\nGenpact targeted 200 specific candidates through personalised talent marketing\ncampaigns. In less than 4 weeks, the team was able to shortlist over 21 senior\ntech professionals, and hire them through a customized interview process and\nget them on board, faster.\n\n_**Closing the gaps in understanding talent**_\n\nWhile the focus on EX is skyrocketing, only 52% of talent professionals say\ntheir company provides a positive employee experience. This means that\norganizations still have a lot of work to do. One reason why employee\nexperience suffers may be that while companies are listening to workers,\nthey\u2019re not always taking action. Our global data says that employees who\ndon\u2019t believe their company will act on their feedback are 7x more likely to\nbe disengaged than those who do, according to data from Glint. Clearly,\ninnovative approaches are called for -- new tools are emerging to help\norganizations close the gap between feedback and action. The right technology\ncan help leaders build habits around regular conversations with their teams\nand encourage action at every level of the organization.\n\nWhen it comes to people analytics, there\u2019s a steep learning curve from\ncollecting data to capitalizing on the insights to build a competitive\nadvantage. Almost half of companies feel good about maintaining clean,\naccurate data. But only 39% feel good drawing meaningful insights from their\ndata. There\u2019s a similar drop-off in the transition from \u201cacting\u201d (i.e.,\nsolving existing problems with insights) to \u201ccapitalizing\u201d (taking advantage\nof new opportunities with insights). For example, many might be comfortable\nacting after a spike in attrition, but fewer would be able to proactively hire\nahead of a spike in demand.\n\nWhile some of the areas where companies are currently using analytics include\nemployee performance and workforce planning, one cautionary note is that it is\ncritically important to be careful with people data. Experts recommend\ntreating employees as stakeholders as organizations develop thoughtful and\ntransparent policies.\n\nToday, as we deal with the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus, the most\nimportant topic in HR remains improving employee experience with empathy at\nthe core. Hence, keeping compassion at your foundation can produce better\nbusiness results and build an indispensable workplace culture.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

Let's see how\nthe pandemic is impacting the employment and hiring across the industries.\n\n![Unemployment and hiring trends during\nCOVID-19](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586096599/1586096598.jpg)\n\nPeople around the world are increasingly worried about how they are going to\npay their bills as coronavirus forces businesses to close and costs millions\nof jobs. United Nations has estimated a job loss of five-25 Mn. Additionally;\nthe International Labor Organization (ILO) stated the world would lose $860 Bn\nto $34 Tr in labor income.\n\n> This is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labor\n> market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people. - ILO\n> Director-General, Guy Ryder\n\nThe surge in jobless claims is being fueled by the growing number of\ncompanies, including Marriott, Macy's and GE that have announced layoffs or\nfurloughs as they try to weather the economic storm caused by the pandemic.\n\nHere are some top hiring trends we are observing during the ongoing pandemic:\n\n### Industries experiencing major ramification\n\n  * **Airlines And Airport Operators**\n\nThe aviation sector is already fleecing with IndiGo announcing a salary cut\nfor its employees. Besides that GoAir has already retrenched many of its expat\npilots. If things do not improve we can expect huge job cuts in the aviation\nsector. Many of the airline companies take aircraft on lease and have to pay\nregular money to the leasing companies irrespective of whether they fly or\nkeep these aircraft grounded. All this will put extra pressure on the aviation\ncompanies and they will be forced to sack people. It is also contemplating\nsalary cuts and a voluntary no-pay leave scheme up to certain management\npositions. Given these conditions, airline including global companies like\nSingapore Airlines, United Airlines have suspended all their hiring till at\nleast June.\n\n  * **Travel, Tourism & Hospitality **\n\nA large percentage of total tourism business activity of India, which is\nestimated at $28 billion-plus in forex and upwards of Rs 2 lakh crore in\ndomestic tourism activity, will be at economic risk throughout the year.\n\n> Indian tourism and hospitality industry is staring at a potential job loss\n> of around 3.8 crore, which is around 70 percent of the total workforce, due\n> to the Covid-19 impact.\n\nCOVID-19 effect is such that it can lead to severe to very severe impact on\nthe travel and tourism sector in India with thousands of jobs being axed. \u201cIn\nIndia many hotels both luxury and budget are running at just 10 percent of\noccupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips. This may\nfurther worsen in the times to come at least till end of this year. For\ninstance, Airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a\nfull refund. This step would have hurt the company very much.\n\nTravel firm MakeMyTrip has announced salary cuts as the tourism sector has\ntaken a massive hit due to the coronavirus outbreak. MakeMyTrip founder Deep\nKalra said that the pay cut will happen across top and managerial levels of\nthe company. Moreover, the salary cut has been done across MakeMyTrip (MMT)\nLimited subsidiaries - Goibibo and redBus. Besides, the company might also lay\noff about 400 employees who are not on its payroll. \"MakeMyTrip has about 650\npeople employed for backend and support services. It has plans to fire 60\npercent of its total headcounts in these departments,\" Entrackr quoted an\nanonymous source.\n\n### Slowdown in hiring\n\nAccording to industry experts, the overall hiring sentiments is likely to\nwitness with 60-65 percent interviews getting delayed especially in service\nsectors. Sectors like BFSI, Retail, and Logistics, where a lot of frontline\nhiring takes place are likely to witness delay.\n\n> C -suite hiring has fallen by 50 percent following the COVID-19 outbreak and\n> this is far worse than what was witnessed during the 2008-09 global\n> financial crisis, said headhunters. The worst affected has been the hiring\n> of expatriates, they said.\n\nAccording to an executive hiring company, \u201cGrowth-related appointments at\ncompanies have come off by up to 50-60 percent. Companies have communicated to\nthem that there is a freeze on leadership hiring for the next six months. So\nmuch so that if an offer has been made but the candidate has not resigned\n(from their present companies), it should be revoked.\u201d\n\n### B-schools internship and final placements on hold\n\nThe summer internship season that would have ideally begun in April has now\neither been deferred to late April or has gone remote/virtual amid the\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus) scare at some of the top B-schools.\n\nFor instance, nine have seen internship cancellation by three companies at\nIndian Institute of Management (IIM) Lucknow. On the other hand, students at\nother B-schools like IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Kozhikode, IIM Indore, FMS Delhi and\nXLRI Xavier Institute of Management have been issued deferred joining dates or\nhave been asked to work remotely. While domestic internships have been\nrelatively less impacted, international internship projects stand canceled\nwith internship periods reduced from typically 7-8 weeks to 5 weeks now,\ndepending on when the lockdown ends.\n\n> However, final placement joining dates, which usually fall in May or June,\n> are yet to see much impact except deferment in some cases. Yet, few LinkedIn\n> posts are doing rounds around consulting companies that have revoked the\n> final placement offers.\n\n### Industries experience surge in hiring and labor shortage\n\nThis swift change in businesses\u2019 daily operations due to ongoing pandemic\ndoesn\u2019t have to mean, \u201cno one is hiring.\u201d In fact, no matter what economy\nwe\u2019re in, one thing is always certain: there are still companies hiring, some\nare even increasing their need for new employees.\n\nOnline groceries like BigBasket, and e-commerce companies like Amazon,\nFlipkart are hiring on-ground staff has been the biggest challenge after\nmigrant workers fled to their native places from various states due to\nlockdown.\n\n> It is reported that e-commerce companies experience about 80-90 percent\n> labor shortage.\n\n### Dependence on technology\n\nVirtual career fairs and events, fully remote recruiting, more personalized\ncareer paths, and greater insights into candidate experiences are quickly\nbecoming the new normal in a post-COVID-19 world. The COVID-19 pandemic is\nquickly changing how every organization is attracting, recruiting, and\nretaining employees on their virtual teams, making remote work the new normal.\n\n### Regulatory framework around deferring joining letters and layoffs\n\n  * **Are advisories with respect to the non-termination of employees binding or not?**\n\nThe said advisories are in the nature of guidelines and are not binding on the\nemployers. However, the MHA order issued on March 29, 2020 has been issued\nunder section 10 (2) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for payment of wages\non the due date without any deduction, is binding.\n\n  * **Can an employer terminate/retrench its employees?**\n\nThe employers may terminate/retrench their employees in accordance with the\napplicable rules. However, until the nationwide lockdown remains in effect,\nthe Government of India has directed all the employers to pay the wages to\ntheir workers on the due date without any deduction.\n\n  * **What are some of the remedies if an employee is terminated/retrenched?**\n\nFor an employee who falls under the category of a \u2018workman1\u2019, their conditions\nof service are governed by the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 (\u2018Act\u2019). Section\n2A of the Act provides that dismissal of an individual workman will be deemed\nto be an industrial dispute.\n\nThe dispute can be settled by way of conciliation or by adjudication. In case\nthe matter is settled by way of conciliation, a settlement is arrived between\nthe employer and employee, and dispute comes to an end.\n\nIn case the dispute is not settled, the dispute is referred to adjudication.\nThe process of adjudication is as follows:\n\nThe dispute is referred to as the Grievance Settlement Authority. In case the\ndecision of Grievance Settlement Authority is not acceptable to the employer\nand/or the workmen, the appropriate government, by an order in writing,\nrefers2 the dispute for adjudication to:\n\n  * Board of Conciliation\n  * Court for enquiry\n  * Labour Court (if dispute pertains to matters specified in Second Schedule)\n\nTribunal (if dispute pertains to matters specified in Second or the third\nSchedule)\n\nIn case the employer and the workmen agree to refer the industrial dispute to\narbitration, at any time before the industrial dispute has been referred under\nSection 10 of the Act to a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal.\n\nFor an employee who is a non-workman, their conditions of service are governed\nby the letter of appointment/ employment contract, issued by the employer and\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the State-Specific Shops and Establishment\nLegislations as well as the various orders that have been issued by various\ndepartments of central and state governments during the lockdown. A non-\nworkman may approach the civil court and/or the court designated under the\nShops and Establishments legislation seeking payment of any unpaid dues and/or\ndamages for wrongful termination if the termination was against the terms\nagreed by the employer.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:\n[Recruitment](/category/recruitment/recruitment?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=recruitment\n\"Browse more in: Recruitment\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Anushree Sharma](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1500295266/authors/anushree-\nsharma.jpg)](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\n#### [Anushree Sharma](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\nAnushree is an Assistant Manager- Content at People Matters.

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

That's essentially what we're finding.\n\n\"We also looked at what that means in terms of NAB's money. So in an average\nyear, NAB gets a profit of around $5-6 billion - depending on multiple things,\nof course, but that's what it's been like historically - and we can see that\nemployee motivation accounts for around a billion [of that]. So that's the\nmonetary value of it.\"\n\nRasmussen said the data had helped neutralise \"chicken and egg conversations\"\ninternally at the executive level on how to grow customer engagement and\nshareholder value.\n\n**Useful new hires**\n\nIn a second use case, NAB is using analytics to work out how to accelerate its\ntime-to-value from new hires - and then how to keep them happy enough to stay\na while.\n\n\"We've done a lot of work on looking at the value that an individual employee\nbrings over the time that they're in a position,\" he said.\n\n\"Day one, you start in a new job, you don't add value. You're basically taking\nvalue from your colleagues, because you don't know anything. You do that for\ntwo or three months, but you're not contributing value to the first stage. And\nwe train you, so we're pouring money your way but you're not delivering.\n\n\"At some point in time you start delivering, and we want to find out how we\ncan accelerate the time for you to get to peak performance or full\ncontribution.\n\n\"We see there's big variance, and some people do it better than others, so how\ndo we replicate those examples of people that get up to speed really quickly?\"\n\nThe work also extended to understanding how to keep employees happy for longer\nand therefore adding value over a longer period of time.\n\n\"We want to make sure that you don't leave your job too early,\" Rasmussen\nsaid.\n\n\"That's a big thing in financial services and also in Australia.\"\n\nRasmussen said NAB was \"managing a paradox\".\n\n\"As individual employees, we want career development, the new job, the new\nsalary and all that excitement and career progression - but what our customers\nwant is for the same person to stay in the job for longer,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't want to change their banker every two years just because [their\nbanker] has career intentions. They want the same banker that understands them\nand their business.\n\n\"So we need to make sure that we make it easy and attractive for our employees\nto do what we want them to do. There's significant value to be had by just\nextending time in role.\"\n\n**Call centre attrition**\n\nA third use case for people analytics involved reducing attrition in a call\ncentre environment.\n\n\"We had call center-like environments with a lot of attrition, and they didn't\nknow why,\" Rasmussen said.\n\n\"I came in on analytics, and basically what we found is there's something\ncalled 'grade of service', which is basically a measure of how quickly do you\npick up the phone in a call centre.\n\n\"Our customers would call in wanting help with something and if grade of\nservice is low, that means they've been on the line for 5-10 minutes before\nthey get to speak to someone, and that means the first thing [the NAB agent]\ndoes on every call is to say, 'Hello, I'm Thomas from NAB, I'm really, really\nsorry, you had to wait so long'.\n\n\"And when you're done with that, you do it with next call and the next call\nand the next call, so it's a workload indicator.\"\n\nRasmussen said his team's work indicated that \"when grade of service or\nworkload drops below a certain level, it starts a chain of events that we\ncan't control - a negative spiral.\"\n\n\"The best performers leave,\" he said.\n\nThe workload on the remaining agents increases, training and coaching is cut\nbecause there's no longer time for it, and that leads to \"a further\ndeterioration in workload\" and costs to the organisation.\n\n\"So attrition spirals out of control,\" Rasmussen said.\n\n\"The only way to stop it is to put extra people in there.\"\n\nThe findings helped the call centre pitch NAB's finance team to hire in extra\nresources in order to cut attrition rates.\n\n\"We had to have this conversation with finance, where they're like, 'We want\nto save money and take people out'. But if you start the year by taking people\nout, you will start this cycle, and it will cost you this much in attrition.\n\n\"So instead of taking $4 million out at the beginning of the year, you should\ngive them $6 million in additional FTE and then at the end of the year, you\nwill save $4 million, rather than spending more.\"\n\n**Ethics and risk**\n\nRasmussen said there were \"many other projects\" that involved people analytics\nbut that he was unable to discuss them.\n\nHe also indicated there was some residual concern in the bank as to how far to\ntake people analytics.\n\n\"I think what we're struggling with is there's so much cool stuff we can do,\nand then it's [the] ethics [of doing some of them],\" he said.\n\n\"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. We're trying to stay on the\nright side of creepy because if people analytics crosses that creepy line,\nwe're going to erode our opportunities to do good.\n\n\"We have some projects where we want to make sure that we stay on the right\nside of that line, and with increased technology and merging many different\ndata sources and so on, you can get dangerously close.\"\n\nRasmussen suggested increased use of artificial intelligence algorithms\nremained an area of personal discomfort.\n\n\"This is just my point of view, but there's a lot of tech today that has some\nsort of AI in it, and I want to know what it is,\" he said.\n\n\"AI is a bit like a power tool. If it's used by a professional, it can really\ndrive efficiency, but if it's used by somebody like me, and you make a\nmistake, you greatly amplify the impact of the mistakes as well.\n\n\"And when I have conversations with some of these vendors, some of them just\nsay, 'Oh, you can't see under the hood of what's in the AI, it's proprietary'.\nat which point of time I say 'Bye!!'\n\n\"So those are some of the things where we're trying to push the boundaries.\"\n\nGot a news tip for our journalists?

create enriching career conversations through data\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### For Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and Projects, Brenntag Asia\nPacific, people analytics is about the ability to gather and combine data to\ntell meaningful stories and gain insights about a specific situation and about\npeople. He shares more in this short interview with Priya Sunil.\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nThe needs vary, and include: boosting sales revenue; penetrating a new market;\nstudying customer buying trends; measuring customer satisfaction levels;\nenhancing the current supply chain and distribution network; hiring and\ndeveloping talent; succession planning; career management; reducing staff\nattrition; driving performance and company culture, and engaging a\nmultigenerational workforce.\n\nAt Google, for instance, the firm\u2019s Project Oxygen uses people analytics to\nuncover the practices of its best managers and provides coaching sessions for\nlow performers. While at Dell, analytics is used to increase the success of\nits sales force.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) uses people analytics to\nidentify the traits of great managers, and leverages that for their\ndevelopment. RBC also uses internal and customer data to diagnose reasons for\nthe performing and non-performing branches, regions or product innovation.\n\nBack home, Singapore is investing in becoming a SMART nation. The key pillars\nto support this are a digital economy, digital government, and digital\nsociety. Our people, our companies and our public agencies all have a role to\nplay in this transformation by becoming a value-creating nation going forward,\nversus a value-adding one.\n\nOverall, it is about the ability to gather and combine data to tell meaningful\nstories and gain insights about a specific situation and about people, while\nallowing you to plan interventions that will solve key organisational\nchallenges and, ultimately, drive business outcomes.\n\n**Q Based on your experience across industries, what key factors form the\nbasis of each industry\u2019s needs?**\n\nPeople make things happen. It is an opportunity to create self-awareness for\nthe organisation and employees around people analytics and what it can do for\nthem, and, in doing so, engage them to play their part. It is also about\nunderstanding and gaining insights, for example, about people\u2019s behaviours,\nforecasting trends and predicting events for better decision-making, to name\nsome.\n\nUnderstanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\nconversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations. This is\nstrategic in developing talent initiatives to achieve organisational goals,\nengaging the hearts and minds of employees, and building that ultimate\nemployee experience that promotes the company brand.\n\n> ##### Understanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\n> conversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations.\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ncome across?**\n\nThe first challenge lies in combining accurate and clean data from various\nsystems, in order to mine valuable insights and interpretation of the\nemployee\u2019s behaviour and journey. Another challenge is in ensuring sound\ngovernance around how the data is processed, used and kept with compliance to\nthe local data security and privacy policy.\n\nIn my view, the next challenge is around building understanding and commitment\nto change as part of the communication strategy and change management.\nFinally, the challenge also lies in developing the competencies and skills of\nthe HR professionals and employees who use the data to support decision-\nmaking.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\nFirms intending to embark on this rewarding and exciting journey are advised\nto begin with a road map. Asking the right questions will lead to actionable\ninsights, while setting a vision with clear goals provides clarity of\ndirection about what you want to achieve. Organisations should also be able to\nidentify the support required and assemble the team members who are passionate\nabout analytics.\n\nIn managing the expectations and communicating the need for change, HR is\npresented with an opportunity to diagnose, and build understanding and\ncommitment to change for the organisation. First, begin with one or two key\ninitiatives that will solve key organisational challenges and witness the ROI\nin the journey to get buy-in, and establish credibility in the process.\n\nFurther, firms who wish to revamp their existing people analytics model are\nadvised to look critically at what areas have worked well, what has not, and\nwhat can be stopped. The important takeaways are, overall, the rich lessons\nlearnt as an organisation, as a team and as an individual through the\nexperience. This will provide guidance in the road map for the next phase of\nyour people analytics journey.\n\nWe are living in a data-driven economy. Data is now readily available,\ncomplemented by many tools being developed in the market to boost analytics\ncapabilities and cater to the interest in big data. Progressive companies see\nthe advantage of leveraging people data to make better decisions, managing\npeople at work, and reaping the benefits of implementing a people analytics\nstrategy.\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published as part of a feature in[Human Resources Online\u2019s\nJanuary-February 2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of\nthe Singapore magazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the\nMalaysia magazine.

By analyzing the scaled data, HR can better\nsupport business decisions. With these facts, they can move from the bottom\nline and change their relationship with the senior management team. This way,\nHR could have a stronger position on the board of a company. They could\nmeasure their own and the employees\u2019 performance, and with time they can\ncompare it to different timelines.\n\nWe can approach the importance of HR analytics from two sides. On the one\nhand, without measurable results, HR is not able to prevail at the business\nlevel. To represent its interests, HR should be able to conjugate statistics\nwith its achievements. On the other hand, HR analytics is also known as people\nanalytics. It revolves around analyzing people's problems using data to answer\ncritical questions about an organization.\n\nThe [Games for Business](https://gamesforbusiness.com/) team has gathered some\nareas that HR should keep an eye on in their daily lives.\n\n####  **1\\. Employee satisfaction**\n\nPeople are the key elements of running a successful business, and HR is the\nconnection between the company and its employees.\n\nWith the recruitment process, an employee\u2019s corporate journey has just begun.\n\nAfter this critical phase, the next crucial point is onboarding, which will\nfundamentally define the employee's integration into the workplace.\n\nIt is essential to get regular feedback about our employee\u2019s wellbeing. With a\nquestionnaire, we can qualitatively measure employee satisfaction. Still, at\nthe end of the day, we shouldn't forget that human relationships need quality\ntime and good conversations in the company during a coffee break, for example.\nDissatisfaction is a major cause of employee turnover. It is vital to act on\ntime and reduce fluctuation.\n\n####  **2\\. Employee engagement**\n\nA strong level of employee engagement predicts higher productivity, better\ncustomer service, lower turnover, and many other relevant and positive\noutcomes.\n\nOur projects at Games for Business have proven that learning participation\nrates are directly related to employee engagement. At CIB Bank, employees\nvoluntarily spent 3 and 1/3 hours on average with learning about\ndigitalization processes and tools in the system. During Coca-Cola\u2019s corporate\nstrategy training campaign, employee engagement was not only strong during\nbusiness hours, but 51% of all user activity was recorded outside of working\nhours. Looking at learning participation rates, we will see the percentage of\nemployees who take part in professional courses and training sessions. Beyond\nthat, we can measure engagement with index numbers like average learning time\n(usage time of the learning system / the number of users), or average\ncompletion rate (the number of users who successfully complete the task / the\ntotal number who attempted it). If we look beyond internal learning, PwC, for\nexample, has implemented our system for an employer branding campaign, after\nwhich 77% of users changed their opinion about the company in positive ways.\n\n####  **3\\. Time to Productivity**\n\nEmployee productivity is closely related to employee satisfaction and employee\nengagement. Happy employees are more productive. In most cases, the working\nhours of a company are predefined. Companies are increasingly letting this\ntraditional mentality go. Nowadays, it doesn't matter how many hours you work\nfor a day. What matters is what you have achieved.\n\nBesides the productivity rate, it is even more important to track \u2018time to\nproductivity.\u2019 This is the average period needed for newly hired employees to\nreach the targeted level of work efficiency.\n\nThis metric tells a lot about your company's onboarding process. If you use\nour learning platform as an onboarding system, it is easy to measure time to\nproductivity. Users receive clear goals and activities they are expected to\naccomplish during a determined period. We can compare individual results with\nthe average time needed to complete the onboarding process.\n\n####  **4\\. Training effectiveness**\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of training, you need to measure what people have\nlearned. This can be tricky if you are only running traditional classroom\ntraining. In contrast, using a digital learning platform makes it much easier\nto retrieve data and communicate it to the management team.\n\nBefore the training, it is also crucial to have a placement test to assess the\naverage knowledge level in the given topic. After the training, it is also\nessential to deepen and measure the acquired knowledge based on prior\nobjectives.\n\nOne can also measure the participation rate (number of colleagues who\nparticipated in the training / number of colleagues invited to the training),\nhow costs are distributed per employee (training costs / number of training\nparticipants) or compare user results (comparing individual performance with\nthe average performance of employees).\n\n####  **5\\. 90-day quit rate**\n\nThis KPI is a turnover metric that shows the number of hires who leave the\ncompany within their first three months. It is often a critical period for\nmany companies.\n\nTypically, it is HR's job to recruit the right people and support their work\nwith a proper onboarding process. Failing to do so will have a measurable\nnegative impact on organizational effectiveness.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why Generali decided to implement our gamified\ndigital learning platform for their induction process. Since the application\nof the tool, Generali has seen an outstanding improvement in its people\u2019s\ndevelopment as well as in the sales revenue. This KPI is particularly relevant\nwhen it is combined with other features. You can see turnover rates for\nspecific worker groups such as underperformers, salespeople, millennials or\nmid-level managers, etc. Take your time to view the data from different\nangles. The most common way to calculate the 90-day quit rate is if you divide\nthe number of employees who leave the company during their first three months\nwith the number of employees who entered in the same period.\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

HR technology, buyers remain unsatisfied with\noutcomes.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 9, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JonathanSears-250x375.jpg)\n\nJonathan Sears\n\nSears says traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

human resources officers (CHROs) to chief people officers,\nsenior leadership in HR has witnessed a sea change in the last decade. What\ntrends will define employees and the workplace of the future? Are chief people\nofficers equipped to navigate the future of work?_**\n\nThe role of the chief people officer emerged to introduce employee-centricity\ninto the HR ecosystem. Instead of (or in addition to) the administrative\ngovernance that the [chief human resources officer\n(CHRO)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-succession/chief-\nhuman-resources-officer-role/) is tasked with, a chief people officer must\nlook after the company culture, employee experience, and how people assets are\nleveraged for organizational growth.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834d4ab5728.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nOne could even say that [employee-\ncentricity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/culture/wednesday-\nwisdom-steven-bianchi-beamery/) forms the cornerstone of this role.\n\nBut are chief people officers across the world ready to take on the\nchallenges, changes, and requirements brought on by [new\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/new-work-tips-for-hr/)?\nAre they ready to maximize talent and deliver superior employee experiences in\nthe current HR landscape?\n\nLet\u2019s find out.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **2020 HR Predictions: Preparing HR Leaders for the Year\nAhead**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/2020-hr-predictions-\npreparing-hr-leaders-for-the-year-ahead/)\n\n## **The Changing Definition of the Chief People Officer**\n\nThe role of the chief people officer is relatively new, having gained\npopularity in the last decade. With the rise of complex employee expectations,\nand the need to deliver superior experiences geared to retain top talent, this\nrole has begun to gain momentum, often in place of traditional CHROs.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers can look forward to unprecedented\ntransformations on the road ahead to employee development and growth.\nAccording to a [study](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-\nGB/Insights/2020/01/the-future-chief-people-officer-imagine-invent-ignite) of\n500+ executives by Willis Towers Watson in partnership with SHRM Executive\nNetwork, HR People + Strategy, 99% said that chief people officers require the\nagility to evolve in response to employee demands. But only 35% said that\nthese C-level leaders are receiving the preparatory development they will\nneed.\n\nIn this context, it is clear that the role of the chief people officer is\nundergoing a radical transformation. In 2020, these leaders will need to watch\nout for key trends that impact their workforce and realign their strategies\naccordingly. From ensuring employee-centricity, the definition of chief people\nofficer will extend to ensuring employee empowerment in a nuanced fashion.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Training Leaders to Improve Employee, Team and\nOrganizational\nPerformance**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/training-leaders-to-improve-employee-team-and-organizational-\nperformance/)\n\n## **5 Trends That Every Chief People Officer Must Watch Out for in 2020**\n\nIf we look at near-term possibilities in HR, several shifts emerge that could\nimpact how chief people officers operate. Specifically, they will have to re-\nenvision their stance in sync with the following five trends:\n\n### **1\\. \u201cPeople\u201d will extend to more than traditional employees**\n\n  \nA lot has been said about how [external\nworkers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/what-are-\nexternal-workers-and-how-can-you-engage-them-for-better-roi/) (i.e., those\noutside the immediate payroll) will upend HR systems. In 2020, the number of\nexternal workers or \u201cfreelancers\u201d who contribute meaningfully to a company\u2019s\noutput will increase dramatically.\n\nUpwork [survey](https://www.slideshare.net/upwork/freelancing-in-\namerica-2019/1) _ed_ 6,000 U.S. adults in 2019, finding that 35% of the\ncountry\u2019s workforce was engaged in freelancing, and 45% of this comprised\nskilled labor.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers will have to rewire the [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/) from the perspective of external workers as well,\nmaking core elements such as employee benefits, [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/), and [learning &\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-is-the-year-of-learning-and-development-insights-from-\nlinkedins-2019-workplace-learning-report/) easily accessible to those outside\nthe company.\n\n### **2\\. Belongingness in the workplace will assume utmost importance**\n\n  \nA [study by Gettysburg\nCollege](https://www.gettysburg.edu/news/stories?id=79db7b34-630c-4f49-ad32-4ab9ea48e72b&pageTitle=1%2F3+of+your+life+is+spent+at+work)\nfound that we spend close to a third of our lives at work! This makes ensuring\nhappiness and the sense of community that your employees feel at the workplace\ncritical.\n\nA [2018 workplace analysis of Facebook](https://hbr.org/2018/02/people-\nwant-3-things-from-work-but-most-companies-are-built-around-only-one) found\nthat community was among the top three requirements of employees in the\nworkplace. Together with career opportunities and purpose, it forms a\n\u201cpsychological contract\u201d that a modern employee expects from their employer.\n\nChief people officers must recognize this need and address this through\nproactive initiatives, next-gen technologies, and high-level strategies. For\nexample, replacing Slack with email might foster a feeling of candid\ncamaraderie instead of only formal/purposeful communication. A [culture\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\nculture-analytics-and-how-can-it-help-your-organization/) tool could help\nchief people officers monitor the impact of workplace processes on employee\nsentiment.\n\nRemember, this must also take into account external workers who may not be\npresent on-premise. VR collaboration tools like\n[Vizible](https://www.worldviz.com/virtual-reality-collaboration-software) and\n[MeetinVR](http://meetinvr.net/) might prove useful, as they let workers meet\nvirtually and actually _see_ their colleagues in real-time, regardless of\nlocation. Chief people officers who are mindful of such opportunities and\ninvest accordingly will gain a competitive advantage.\n\n### **3\\. Chief people officers will be the custodians of ethical values**\n\n  \nToday, employees are acutely aware of the ethical nuances governing a\nworkplace. Companies that uphold high standards in terms of diversity &\ninclusion, [gender\nequality](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/companies-must-\nlead-the-change-for-gender-equality/), and compliance will consistently be\nrated as preferred employers for top talent.\n\nConversely, companies that aren\u2019t aware of these requirements risk damaging\ntheir employer brands. Last year, McDonald\u2019s chief people officer [resigned\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/mcdonalds-hr-boss-\nresigns-after-ceos-firing/#4be0c3763f71)from his position after the CEO\nviolated company policy by engaging in a relationship with a company employee.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers will be viewed as \u201cvalue custodians,\u201d guiding\nemployees toward ethical conduct, compliance, and behavior that augments the\ncompany culture.\n\nThis will require specific learning and development initiatives for chief\npeople officers so they can stay ahead of the curve and strengthen the\npositioning of their employer brand.\n\n### **4\\. Collaboration with chief information, data, and security officers\nwill be key**\n\n  \nIn the last few years, HR has increasingly collaborated with various other\nC-level stakeholders to improve the efficacy of the company\u2019s people function.\nIn 2020, this trend will continue, specifically necessitating collaboration\nwith:\n\n  * **Chief information officers (CIOs)** \\- to power [digital transformation in HR ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)and foster a technology-enabled workplace\n  * **Chief data officers (CDOs)** \\- to build a shared [people analytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-people-analytics/) function that delivers the requisite insights for [talent management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-talent-management/) and employee experience enhancement, while developing people analytics skills themselves to become sole owners of this function\n  * **Chief security officers (CSOs)** \\- to adhere to the ever-evolving [employee data privacy rights](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/gdpr-ccpa-employeedatarights/) and regulations, maintaining the company\u2019s compliance stance, particularly while managing an ever-growing distributed workforce\n\n### **5\\. Coaching will be central to chief people officers\u2019 continual\ndevelopment**\n\n  \nTo keep up with all these trends, companies will invest in the continual\ndevelopment of chief people officers, primarily through one-on-one targeted\ncoaching.\n\nCoaching is a popular learning methodology among senior leaders (now being\nadopted for [middle\nmanagers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/executive-coaching-for-middle-managers/) and other ranks as well)\nto hone their leadership skills and capabilities. In fact, \u201cleading teams &\npeople development\u201d was the No. 1 topic covered through internal and external\ncoaching initiatives, as per the [latest\nsurvey](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10248&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)\nby The Conference Board of Canada.\n\nIn 2020, companies will leverage learning and development technology to\ndeliver coaching sessions at chief people officers\u2019 convenience, with access\nto experienced experts in [people\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/). This openness to change, growth, and\nupskilling marks a key trend in the chief people officer\u2019s role as we enter a\nnew decade.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Is Your HR Technology Adaptable for the 2020\nWorkforce?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/adaptable-hr-technology/)\n\n## **Over to You**\n\nApart from investing in their own upskilling and future-readiness, chief\npeople officers must also look at instituting a robust [succession\nplan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/technology-is-vital-for-any-succession-planning-strategy/) to be\nable to fill this position with people who are better prepared for the\nuncertainty that defines the future of work.\n\nFilling in key positions such as this one can be challenging \u2013 not only\nbecause the labor market is tight but also because it is a new role, and more\nyounger individuals are going to be expected to fill it. In such cases, an\norganization\u2019s succession plan needs to be concrete, and employee development\nfor leadership roles must begin early on.\n\nEven as senior leaders adapt to changing workforce dynamics, they will be\ncompelled to maintain a keen focus on the next generation of HR talent and\nhone internal capabilities for seamless succession on the way forward.\n\nIt will be imperative for chief people officers to always stay a step ahead of\nthe trends and ensure that they are prepared for them when the time arises.\nForesight, vision, and agility are the three traits any chief people officer\nneeds to succeed and be prepared for the future of work.\n\n_Do you have a succession plan in place for your chief people officer?

It aimed to bridge the\ngap between school-level education and workplace requirements.\n\nDepending on the median educational qualification available in your region,\nand the day-to-day requirements of work, the definition of human resource\ndevelopment can vary widely.\n\nFor example, a plan to amplify people's potential for a startup in Silicon\nValley will look very different from a human resource development program\ndesigned for a large factory in China.\n\nIn the early days, HRD would involve rigorous hands-on training focused on the\nacquisition of hard skills. Today, the picture is different.\n\nThe skills profile of top-tier talent is highly layered, comprising a mix of\nhard and soft skills. HR must pay equal attention to these areas of human\nresource development to bring out an employee's full potential.\n\nIn addition, strategies to improve culture and build a work environment\nconducive to upskilling and self-development also come under HRD. A data-\ndriven mindset might also prove useful, allowing HR to measure learning\nperformance and dynamically update performance benchmarks.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend an agile approach when defining human resource\ndevelopment for your company, keeping in mind your organization's unique needs\nand its potential to grow.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Learning and Development (L &D;)? Definition,\nObjectives, and Best Practices for\nStrategy**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-\nis-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)\n\n## **5 Key Functions of Human Resource Development**\n\nThere are five formal human resource development functions in an HR\ndepartment:\n\n### **1\\. Strategic talent sourcing and acquisition**\n\n  \nThe first step to enhancing your human capital is to spot and onboard the\nright talent. The best candidates may not always have the most experience or\nthe highest number of qualifications. However, they can be good culture adds\nto your organization.\n\nA careful mix of soft skills, personality, and potential will determine\n**[talent sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , and in turn, the effectiveness of\nhuman resource development.\n\nRight from the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) stage, HR begins to equip the\nemployee with the knowledge required to succeed during the employee's tenure\nin the organization.\n\n### **2\\. Education-oriented employee benefits**\n\n  \nA benefits package focused on human resource development will include\nsponsorships for adult education, assistance for tuition fees, flexible hours\nfor those continuing their learning outside of college, and so on.\n\nFor example, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan provides U.S. employees\nwith tuition coverage for specific universities and degrees. DHL offers a\nsimilar benefit in the form of tuition reimbursement for employees applying\nfor online college degrees.\n\n![The functions of human resource development](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The functions of human resource development**\n\n### **3\\. Performance measurement and management**\n\n  \nPerformance management is at the heart of human resource development.\nEmployees may not always be able to take time out for learning sessions and\nonline courses, which is where a strength-focused [**performance management**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-\nperformance-management/)model kicks in.\n\nManagers regularly review employee performance and share inspiring/coaching\nfeedback. Employees then focus on improving performance, incrementally\nimproving their capabilities. Such a structure requires agility to prove\nuseful.\n\n### **4\\. Formal learning and development programs**\n\n  \nTo complement managers' efforts, you can offer learning and development\nsessions to close specific skills gaps. This must factor in company needs on\nthe one hand and the employee's personal ambitions on the other.\n\nLet's say an employee with leadership potential is interested in the marketing\ndomain. You can assign a learning track that develops both these skill sets\nand gradually helps the employee transition into the marketing department\nwhere they can learn the ropes before taking on that leadership role.\n\n### **5\\. Internal mobility and succession planning**\n\n  \nAn effective human resource development program will ensure that every\nemployee finds the best-fit job within the organization, in sync with their\ndesires and capabilities.\n\nInternal mobility supports lateral transitions, while a succession plan\nfocuses on developing future leaders. Once again, internal mobility and\nsuccession planning must be supported by hard and soft skills training,\nrespectively.\n\nInterestingly, HRD also takes place informally. Unstructured interactions such\nas informal mentorships and on-the-job collaboration can go a long way in\nstrengthening employee capabilities. However, having a structured, measurable\nprogram in place is essential to the success of a human resource development\nprogram.\n\n## **How to Start a Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe many functions of human resource development require several stakeholders\nfrom outside the HR department. That's why launching the program could seem\nlike an effort- and time-intensive task.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of steps that could streamline the process:\n\n### **1\\. Assess internal and external talent potential**\n\n  \nTake stock of your existing workforce and the available talent pool in your\ndomain and region. Estimate hiring timelines for expanding the workforce and\nlaunching the program. To do this, you can use **[HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-hr-\nanalytics/)**. Based on the data the analytics engine has, it can identify the\npotential of each employee and help you develop training programs accordingly.\n\n### **2\\. Map human resource training and development objectives**\n\n  \nMake sure to include both near- and long-term objectives in this step. These\nobjectives could range from upskilling for a project that must be closed in\none month to making your workforce more resilient to ongoing digital\ntransformation. Collaborate with the different stakeholders needed to create\nthis employee career development program \u2013 for instance, department heads and\nteam leaders.\n\n### **3\\. Identify the resources need for training and development**\n\n  \nWhat are the tools, resources, time, and external assistance you need to meet\nthe objectives mapped out in the previous step? Carefully outline these\nprocesses to build a sequential strategy that clearly defines the expected\noutcomes.\n\n### **4\\. Speak to stakeholders and obtain buy-in**\n\n  \nThis could include buy-in from the CEO for high-level business targets, from\nthe CIO for digital tools and implementation, from the CFO for budget\napproval, the CHRO to hire external consultants if required, and the like.\n\n### **5\\. Communicate with on-ground execution managers**\n\n  \nThe program will be primarily executed by team leaders, business unit heads,\nand learning practitioners. Conduct workshops with these individuals\nbeforehand to convey the intended objectives of learning and the approach that\nwill be adopted. Ensure that you adapt the plan based on feedback.\n\n### **6\\. Launch the program and review it at regular intervals** :\n\n  \nAfter a specific interval (a robust HRD program will take time to show\ntangible results), conduct an evaluation.\n\n  * What are the program's strengths and weaknesses?\n  * Is the cost-to-benefit ratio in your favor?\n  * Should the plan have a wider deployment?\n\n  \nReview these parameters and relaunch the program after accommodating this\nfeedback.\n\nThese are some of the foundational steps to start a human resource development\nprogram, no matter what your intended vision might be. Let's now look at a set\nof best practices that can help HR across industries to develop their human\ncapital better.\n\n## **8** **Best Practices for Human Resource Training and Development**\n\nThere are several ways to make sure that your human resource training and\ndevelopment strategy hits the mark.\n\nWe specifically mention the training here because on-the-job training is\npivotal to developing employee capabilities in nearly every field. Whether you\nrun a manufacturing plant or supervise an educational institution, whether\nyour company makes softballs or software platforms, the workforce must be\nadequately trained to produce the expected output.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these best practices:\n\n### **1\\. Assign human resource development owners**\n\n  \nThe best strategies can fall flat if there is no ownership for execution.\nThat's why companies must set specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for\ntraining, development, and performance, with process owners who are tasked\nwith improving these metrics. These individuals may be L&D; practitioners in\nthe organization, team leaders, line managers, and the like.\n\n### **2\\. Contain attrition among trained workers by focusing on engagement**\n\n  \nHuman resource training and development involves significant investment per\nemployee, which becomes redundant when a highly trained resource leaves the\norganization. This is where focusing on ancillary HR functions such as\n**[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** , recognition, and culture-building\ncan help prevent **[employee\nattrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n### **3\\. Use rewards and recognition to incentivize learning**\n\n  \nRecognition is closely linked with **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and therefore helps to\ncontain attrition in your workforce. Rewards for course completion and\nsuperior performance can also motivate employees further.\n\n### **4\\. Coordinate pan-organizational development**\n\n  \nTraining and development tracks in different departments/business units should\nnot be planned independently of each other. A centralized approach that keeps\nin mind the progress each department is making can enable the HRD program to\nmeet the company's shared vision and purpose.\n\n### **5\\. Link career progression to development**\n\n  \nCareer progression shouldn't entirely depend on the length of an employee's\ntenure. After training and development sessions, if an employee is seen to be\nan exceptional performer, you can develop a personalized career progression\ntrack for them.\n\n### **6\\. Initiate human resource training and development from day 1**\n\n  \nYou can work together with the recruitment team to embed training into the\n**[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**. This will give\nnew employees an understanding of your continuous learning culture, making\nlater-stage training much easier.\n\n### **7\\. Avoid a cookie-cutter training and development journey**\n\n  \nOne of the most significant transformations in human resource development is\nthe emerging need for personalization. Today, employees are aware of their\nunique capabilities, which demand personalized and adaptive learning\nmethodologies. Here's where corporate eLearning software can help.\n\n### **8\\. Make the development transferable**\n\n  \nA formal human resource development program should offer certifications,\nmicro-credentials, and even digital badges upon completion. These achievements\nare transferable to other jobs outside the organization and can encourage\nemployees to fast-track the learning process.\n\nThese are some of the best practices that can strengthen your human resource\ndevelopment strategy and make your training initiatives genuinely stick.\n\n## **4 Software Tools to Support Your Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe HR technology landscape is continuously growing, including learning and\ndevelopment tech. Several of these tools can prove useful to develop a\ncompany's employee potential. So, consider the following platforms when\noutlining your HRD strategy for 2020:\n\n### **1\\. A job shadow enablement software like Grandshake**\n\n  \nNearly 70% of all learning happens via on-the-job experiences. That's why job\nshadowing and apprenticeship have traditionally been integral to human\nresource development.\n\nNow, platforms like Grandshake are taking it one step further.\n\nYou can connect with local schools and educational organizations, you can\nengage with the \"shadowee\" and screen applications through video resumes, and\nyou can improve performance through the in-platform feedback loop.\n\n### **2\\. A workforce analytics platform like** **Cognisess**\n\n  \nWorkforce analytics can reveal valuable insights into your human resource\npotential, future possibilities, and next-best actions to boost performance.\nAnalytics is now critical for human resource development programs, which is\nwhy solutions like Cognisess have rapidly gained traction.\n\nCognisess Pro is a predictive people analytics platform that has 50+\nassessments to measure 120+ performance attributes. It uses AI to bypass the\nrisk of bias/subjectivity, maximizing the value of your people assets.\n\n### **3\\. A career pathing and internal mobility tool like** **Paddle**\n\n  \nIn a large workforce, hidden employee potential can go unnoticed. Your human\nresource development program should be able to tap into such capabilities to\noptimize resource utilization in your company. A tool like Paddle can match\nemployees with the right role, improving overall productivity.\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered tool for career pathing and internal mobility\nstreamlining. It has a repository of learning materials to support\ntransitions. The tool's AI can analyze employee skill sets and career\nhistories to recommend the most suitable career path.\n\n### **4\\. A multi-device e-learning authoring solution like** **Gomo**\n\n  \nYour e-learning platform must combine multi-device delivery for convenient,\npersonalized learning experiences with advanced analytics on employee\nprogress. Gomo has two modules: Authoring for e-learning content generation\nand Delivery & Analytics to track consumption on multiple devices.\n\nGomo is a no-installation SaaS product that's easy to use, reducing the time-\nto-value from your human resource development program. It is used by the likes\nof Vodafone, Sony, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n## **Looking Forward: Which Areas of Human Resource Development Demand\nAttention in 2020?**\n\nThe definition of human resource development concept covers a broad spectrum.\n\nWith so many areas and functions to address, it can be challenging to\nprioritize those that demand the most attention. Fortunately, predictive\nanalytics tools can highlight which organization-specific areas of human\nresource development should rank the highest on your checklist for every\nquarter/year.\n\nApart from this, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the latest HR trends and\nmap your HRD program to global benchmarks to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nFor 2020, we recommend a keen focus on the following areas:\n\n  * **Shedding legacy practices:** Three out of five HR leaders fear irrelevance in 2020 if the HR function doesn't embrace modernization, as per KPMG's [survey](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-future-of-human-resources-2020.html) of 1,300 HR leaders.\n  * **Establishing a culture framework:** 61% of respondents in the survey we cited are in the process of changing their culture.

Essentially, gathering and assessing people analytics\nleads to better decision-making through the application of statistics and\nother data interpretation techniques.\n\nSmarter, more strategic, and data-backed talent decisions are thus closer at\nhand, and this is applicable throughout the employee lifecycle \u2013 from making\nbetter hiring decisions and more effective performance management to better\nretention.\n\nPeople analytics has evolved considerably from when it was first used in\norganizations in the mid-1900s. There has been a clear transition from\nprescriptive analytics to predictive analytics, with which organizations can\nnow be better prepared to face the dynamism of their operational environment\nand be proactive rather than reactive. For example, sophisticated data\nscience, interactive data visualization, and machine learning \u2013 all integral\nparts of people analytics today \u2013 were nowhere a part of the process until a\nfew decades ago.\n\n## **The Process of People Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics today is a lot more intuitive and predictive. With that\nexpectation to live up to, the process involves the following steps.\n\n![The Process of People Analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Step 1: Dig data that matters**\n\n  \nThe core question to ask here is, \u201cWhat data is relevant to our business\ngoals?\u201d\n\nand to set the key performance indicators (KPIs) accordingly. This allows you\nto save major resources by only investigating areas that need direct\nmonitoring, such as operational tasks within the people management spectrum,\nand can lead to tangible business success.\n\nIf it does not add strategic value, digging that data could be a waste of\ntime. Knowing what to focus on also helps in applying the right statistics,\ndata mining, machine learning, survey management, and strategic workforce\nmanagement tools.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **Step 2: Experiment, explore, enrich**\n\n  \nIn a crowded and visibly fragmented market, it is imperative to choose a\npeople analytics tool by exploring the market, experimenting with different\noptions, and analyzing which option would enrich the organization the most.\nMultiple offerings include data mining, data transformation, and data\nvisualization techniques, all merged into a user-friendly self-service\ninterface.\n\nPlatforms that offer a wide range of features often require a lot of manual\nmanipulation to access important data, and these aspects can be tested only\nthrough systematic experimentation.\n\n### **Step 3: Have an action plan ready**\n\n  \nOnce you know what your end goal is, which data is relevant, and what the\navailable options are (based on clear pros vs. cons analysis), create an\naction plan. Applying big data and predictive analytics to **[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)** , leadership development, and organizational capabilities often\nhelps in fine-tuning the action plan.\n\nMoreover, having a well-defined plan of action enables a better understanding\nof why certain changes may be taking place and where the organization is\nheaded and can thus help garner more stakeholder support.\n\n### **Step 4: Avoid legal loopholes**\n\n  \nEnsuring that legal compliance is maintained in the collection of all data is\ncrucial. Before you start on the analytics project, have a legal team validate\nthe data sourcing techniques and processes. It does not end here.\n\nOnce the raw data has been gathered and treated, the results gleaned need to\nbe approved as well before they can be applied or published. In our digital\necosystem, with data protection and privacy laws still evolving, it is prudent\nto keep abreast of the changes and double-check on legal compliance.\n\n### **Step 5: Create leaner systems**\n\n  \nIrrespective of the complexity of the project at hand, the broader strategy\nthat the processes must adhere to needs to be simple and lean. The basic\nprocess of data analysis and interpretation should allow for easy application,\nupdating, and readability.\n\nFor example, create the basic outline simplified as intake and design (data\ncollection and the design of the analysis), data cleaning (removing irrelevant\nor unreliable data), data analysis (quantitative and qualitative exploration),\nand sharing insights (interpretation and presentation of the data). This can\nhelp avoid unnecessary complications such as confusion about the flow of steps\ninvolved, time wastage, or repetition of sub-processes that occur with\nunstandardized process structures, while still allowing room for tweaks where\nnecessary.\n\nThe idea is to find the right balance between the limited moving parts (people\nand the dynamism of the environment) and fluid, customizable systems and\nprocesses of people analytics. When you have the right team with the relevant\nskillset in place, it is easier to streamline the whole process and apply\nquality controls.\n\n### **Step 6: Build a fact-based, measurable HR business strategy**\n\n  \nA realistic HR business strategy avoids functional silos and can align talent\nto business seamlessly. Having clear KPIs and ROI expectations from people\nanalytics endeavors ensures that the impact is measured often and with\ntransparency. A winning strategy needs to be backed by data and an effective\nplan of action.\n\n### **Step 7: Take tech support**\n\n  \nTechnology is interspersed with every aspect of life today and more so with\nprocesses like people analytics, where often a bulk of analytical data is to\nbe treated with little or no room for error. New-age HR tech tools make real-\ntime data easily accessible. And this is an opportunity that needs to be\nmilked because today, agility and real-time intelligence can truly set you\napart from the competition.\n\n## **Four Key People Analytics Trends**\n\nSince people analytics relies heavily on evolving data-mining technologies and\ndata-interpretation strategies, the trends around people analytics develop in\ntime to the same. Here are the top 4 trends that are shaping people analytics\nin itself and how it interacts with the business. Some trends work in a dual\nloop \u2013 they affect people analytics and in turn, all other aspects of HR.\n\n![Four Key People Analytics Trends](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **1\\. Transforming what HR is and does**\n\n  \nBersin research points out that a meager 2% of HR organizations have mature\npeople analytics competence to bank on. There is thus quite a heavy first-\nmover advantage for innovative, intelligent organizations that are trying to\ntap into this space.\n\nWith people analytics changing how recruitment is conducted, how performance\nis measured, how compensation is planned or growth is mapped, and how learning\nand retention can be managed better, people analytics is quickly changing how\nHR operates.\n\nAccording to recent studies by Deloitte, increasing job offer acceptance\nrates, reducing HR help tickets, and optimizing compensation are just a few\nways in which people analytics is quickly becoming the new currency of HR.\nMoreover, with HR processes evolving to keep pace with business needs, people\nanalytics is moving from being a one-time initiative to becoming a real-time,\neasily modifiable tool that HR has immense benefits to draw from.\n\n### **2\\. Transforming HR business interactions**\n\n  \nWith recent trends in the work ecosystem, the interaction between HR and\nbusiness stakeholders (both internal and external) has been undergoing a\ntransformation as well. People analytics needs to change in keeping with the\nlatest trends in leadership. More transparency is a key trend emerging here,\nand intelligent insight is the need of the hour.\n\nBusinesses today need to be able to make sense of seemingly unrelated data\nstreams and find meaning, correlation, and maybe even interdependence between\none or more factors to predict and manage work better. People analytics has\nthe potential to provide actionable recommendations to enable strategic\nplanning and execution processes.\n\n### **3\\. Transforming the HR-employee relationship**\n\n  \nEmployee expectations today are consumer-grade. People analytics is providing\norganizations with the ramp to upgrade the **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)**. Every interaction that a candidate or an employee\nhas with an organization is a data point and could be utilized to glean\ninteresting insights. The idea is the need to transform the relationship that\nthe HR has with employees \u2013 to help HR become and be perceived as more than\njust a support function.\n\n### **4\\. Transforming the quality of insights**\n\n  \nThe quality of insights that are expected on a daily basis has changed over\nthe course of the last couple of years. People analytics can live up to these\nexpectations if you focus on two key aspects: analytics literacy and data\nsecurity.\n\nMore employees will need to become analytics literate to decrease dependence\non technical staff and to allow more perspectives to flourish. As people\nanalytics becomes a staple at organizations, data integrity and data security\nwill need to be upgraded and maintained for all listening channels and pulse\nchecks.\n\nWe discussed legal compliance, but data security should ideally go deeper than\nthat and become a cultural trait within the organization rather than being\nsuperficial check just for the sake of being compliant.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Three Key Level-based Checks to Choose the Right People Analytics Tools**\n\nWith a vast array of available vendors, options, and subscription plans,\nchoosing the right people analytics tools can often seem like a rather\ndaunting task. Here\u2019s a three-level need-based check to make the right\ndecision.\n\n### **Level 1: A working HR dashboard**\n\n  \nTo get started with people analytics, use a basic dashboard that allows you to\ncapture, aggregate, and visualize data.\n\nTools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik allow ease of use and ease of data\naccess. With a level 1 requirement, your priority should be to keep your\npeople analytics system as simple as possible.\n\n### **Level 2: An insightful HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYou may have a steady dose of relevant data and need basic insights to analyze\nbetter and make stronger decisions. Statistical tools like Excel or SPSS are\neffective as well, though they may not come with quirky visual aids and\nsocial-media style interfaces. Tools like Visier, while taking some time to be\nset up, come with holistic analytics solutions.\n\n### **Level 3: A predictive HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYour organization is at the third requirement level when you seek not only to\nanalyze data but also to make intuitive predictions based on upcoming trends.\nThese tools help you study behavior in a way that you can predict the next\ncourse of action.\n\nFor example, there might be some correlation between your employees updating\ntheir LinkedIn page, taking frequent leaves, and with them not being very\ncontent at work. While this is a very simplistic situation, predictive tools\ncould help you make connections with behavior and decision patterns that you\nmight have missed otherwise.\n\nPython or RStudio can help with advanced analyses for large quantities of\ndata, though they might require you to hire data scientists specialized in the\nfield.\n\n## **Update, Upgrade, and Upskill for Smarter People Analytics**\n\nWith the latest people analytics and workforce analytics solutions, you can\ndelve deeper into the behavioral aspects of work, understand the cause-effect\nrelationship between different human and non-human aspects at work, and make\nbetter decisions.\n\nThe three points to remember are to know what data you need to quantify and\nqualify, to understand what the latest trends are, and to know what your end\ngoals are. Enabling your HR to update, upgrade, and upskill their knowledge\nand capabilities will ensure that your organization optimizes the latest\npeople analytics offers and can ride the latest trend waves towards a smarter,\nhappier workforce.\n\n_What people analytics trends do you predict for 2020?

Through the digitization of personal information ranging from\nperformance to communication patterns, we can use AI to reveal insights that\ncan supercharge business success. However, our increasingly remote and\nalgorithm managed workforce can also hide under the digital blanket, free from\nhuman oversight, authentic relationships, and management intuition. What is\nthe role of HR in supporting the \u2018people of the cloud\u2019 in this global age of\nautomation?\n\n## **Reinforce a Unique and Engaging Culture**\n\nIt\u2019s been said that culture eats everything else for breakfast. Big brands are\nsuccessful for many reasons, including their culture. With magnetic founders,\nrags to riches story, and a clearly communicated culture, they are able to\nmotivate and guide a distributed, educated, knowledge workforce. Consider how\nto digitize and disseminate a founder\u2019s mindset. When employees can visualize\nan admirable founder and feel like they are part of a Cinderella story, they\ncan better act in the interest of the organization.\n\n## **Communicate a Clear and Compelling Strategy**\n\nIn a virtual organization where people are more digitally connected than\npersonally connected, clarity of purpose is paramount. Especially in this VUCA\nage, where knowledge workers must operate with agility, people need to know\nwhat truly matters. If they don\u2019t know where they are going, how are they\ngoing to get there? The vision, mission, and values of the organization need\nto be readily available and frequently reinforced. Employees at all levels of\nthe organization should have an \u2018elevator pitch\u2019 at hand if asked what your\ncompany does.\n\n## **Collect Useful Data**\n\nThe volume, variety, and velocity of data are only accelerating, hence the\nlove affair with \u2018Big Data.\u2019 However, an additional \u2018v\u2019 to keep in mind is\nintegrity. How accurate and useful is the workforce data? After all, what gets\nmeasured gets managed.\n\nBesides too little data, there may also be an issue of too much data. It\u2019s\nincreasingly popular to plow through massive troves of data in search of the\ngolden insights. However, just because something is easy to see and\nunderstand, doesn\u2019t mean it matters. Genuinely knowing the individual\ndifferences of a workforce in this digital age is more possible than ever, yet\nrarely done well. Good people analytics that drives strategic growth to\nrequire high-quality people data that is both \u2018reliable\u2019 and \u2018valid.\u2019 These\nare terms every HR professional needs to know.\n\n## **Create an Accessible Data Lake**\n\nSiloed data leads to feeble insights. Precise measurements are like fresh\ningredients for a delicious meal, but a kitchen, recipe, and cook are all\nneeded to serve up something memorable. One advantage of the cloud is the\nability to create a common repository for data that is easily accessible by\nanyone with permission from any internet-connected location. However, for all\nthe advances in statistics and data capture, data management is still\nstruggling to keep up. It\u2019s important to think about and manage how data flows\nand is captured within an organization. To what extent is financial data,\npeople data, operational data, and customer data accessible in a standard\nlocation with the potential for a combination? What level of expertise is\nneeded to access this data and visualize it? Automation and a clear cloud-\nbased data strategy that includes all aspects of the business can help, and HR\nneeds to have a voice in this.\n\n## **Promote Authentic Relationships**\n\nHumanity cannot be automated. People have an innate desire to connect with\nother people, to feel valued, and to feel understood. Digitizing a workforce\ncan lead to people becoming ghosts for the company and investing their\nauthentic selves into side endeavors. Creating opportunities for social\ninteraction, serendipitous conversations, and cross-organizational friendships\ncan yield dividends in terms of loyalty and innovation. Community events,\nsocial committees, internal social platforms for sharing and budget allocated\nto face to face training and conferences are all opportunities to inject\nhumanity back into the digital enterprise.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Transform HR Data Into Business\nResults](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\ntransform-hr-data-into-business-result/)**\n\n## **Be Transparent and Trustworthy**\n\nJust as recruiters can scour the web for intimate details of applicants,\napplicants can peruse glassdoor or other sources to learn the truth about an\norganization. The skeletons in the closet are now dancing in the streets, and\nit\u2019s incumbent upon leadership to promote open, honest two-way communication.\nAs the locker room cultures of wunderkind companies lead to headlines and\nchanges, and as the push for Inclusiveness and Diversity accelerates, HR must\nensure leadership understands the importance of matching words to actions. If\nleaders expect loyalty and honest work, they should show trustworthiness and\nhonesty in their dealings. One role of HR is to advocate for this mindset, not\nout of compassion but out of necessity. In any area of the organization, HR\nshould most understand the pitfalls of eroding trust within the workforce.\n\n## **Provide Automated Coaches and Micro-learnings**\n\nThe days of an apprentice shadowing their master may be fading, but coaching\nand training are as important as ever. Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired\nmagazine, points out in his insightful book The Inevitable, that we are\nentering an age of constant learning. The cloud mentality is one of the\ncontinuous upgrades and steady change. Employees can no longer be expected to\nknow all they need to know, but they can be expected to know how to learn\nquickly. The job of HR and the organization is to make that learning readily\navailable and immediately consumable.\n\n## **Give Internal Stretch Opportunities**\n\nIn our age of ultimate flexibility, the gig economy thrives. It is\nincreasingly common for employees to have \u2018side hustles\u2019 as they seek to\nmaximize earnings, grow, and give back to the community. HR can help provide\nworkers with stretch opportunities, optional side projects, and ways to give\nback internally. If employees are motivated to go \u2018above and beyond,\u2019 then\nit\u2019s essential that organizations channel that enthusiasm. Create internal job\nboards, optional committees, and volunteer projects for people. Track the\nactivity, recognize the efforts, and consider the full range of performance\nwhen evaluating people.\n\n**Learn More:[HR Data Management in a Non-Employee World: 4 Things to\nKnow](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/hr-data-management-\nin-a-nonemployee-world-4-things-to-know/)**\n\n## **Infuse Personality Throughout the Automation**\n\nWarren Bennis said, \u2018the factory of the future will have only two employees, a\nman, and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there\nto keep the man from touching the equipment.\u2019 Automation is inevitable, but it\nneedn\u2019t be dull. HR should consider how to infuse the culture, personality,\nand brand of the organization into all human facing automation.\n\n## **Understand and Respect Privacy**\n\nFinally, although there is an excellent promise in the 21st-century cloud-\nbased organization, there are also privacy concerns that are only growing.\nWhether it\u2019s the new California privacy laws, the European GDPR, or the\nCanadian Privacy Act, HR professionals need to continue to stay abreast of\nemployee regulations and ensure compliance. However, beyond compliance,\norganizations should consider the \u2018psychological contracts\u2019 of employees. This\nis the unwritten contract that describes the understandings, beliefs, and\ncommitments that exist between an employee and employer. Understanding what\nthe employee expects and communicating in a way to maintain that mutual\nunderstanding will go a long way towards minimizing litigation and maximizing\nmotivation.\n\n_Do you know the role of HR in supporting the people of the cloud?

](mailto:enquiries@relocatemagazine.co.uk)\n\nWith government and employer responses to the COVID-19 pandemic accenting\npersonal wellbeing as never before, Mercer\u2019s _2020 Global Talent Trends_ study\nidentifies what it believes are the four trends leaders can harness to \u201c[win\nwith empathy](/articles/leadership-hr-talent-management-renewing-your-license-\nto-lead-blakey-sp20)\u201d now and post-pandemic for international organisations\nand those with globally mobile employees.With the current global health crises\npotentially set to accelerate these themes, Mercer\u2019s\n[survey](https://www.uk.mercer.com/our-thinking/career/global-talent-\ntrends-2020.html) of 7,300+ c-suite executives, HR leaders and employees in 34\ncountries finds that employers are navigating uncertainty with an amplified\nfocus on the health, financial wellbeing and careers of their employees. This\nis putting [HR in the frontline](/articles/events-cipd-ace-2019-putting-\nglobal-people-at-the-heart-of-good-work-1119) of driving organisational\nchange.\n\n## COVID-19 catalysing workplace changes\n\nThe [COVID-19](/articles/health-talent-management-relocate-global-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-resource-centre-0320-reeditor) pandemic and subsequent uncertainty\nare \u201c[accelerating changes](/articles/leadership-talent-management-using-\nemergent-strategies-to-lead-effectively-sshortland-sp20) in the way\norganisations around the world are working and will continue to work into the\nfuture,\u201d says Mercer. With wage growth predicted to be stagnant by 63% of HR\nleaders surveyed and 34% of employees expecting their jobs to be replaced in\nthree years, [purpose](/articles/editorial-festival-of-global-\npeople-12924-how-can-purpose-help-us-in-these-uncertain-times-rholmes) and\nemployee engagement are set to be key, says the consultancy.\n\n## People-centred approaches to managing uncertainty\n\n\u201cBalancing economics and empathy in all people decisions is important, even\nmore so now as we face questions, concerns and the uncertainty of a global\npandemic,\u201d said Ilya Bonic, President, Career and Head of Strategy at Mercer.\n\u201cOrganisations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset that\nenables them to prepare for and invest in the future.\u201d\u201cThis rethinking of\npurpose and priorities is vital across the organisation, but especially for\nHR,\u201d continued Ilya Bonic. \u201cThe findings from this year\u2019s study make it clear\nthat transformation of the HR function is a key component to creating a\nsustainable organisation.\u201d\n\n## Four global talent trends for 2020\n\nMercer\u2019s study identifies four trends for 2020:\n\n###  **1\\. Future focus**\n\nWith a new mandate for business, 85% of executives agree that the\norganisation\u2019s purpose should extend beyond shareholder primacy. Yet only 35%\nof companies deliver on this today.One in three employees say they would\nprefer to work for an employer that shows responsibility towards all\nstakeholders, beyond just shareholders and investors.Much of an organisation\u2019s\nsuccess depends on whether it can support its talent to grow and shape a\nsustainable business, says Mercer. Over two-thirds of executives (68%) want to\nfocus more on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.For employees,\n61% of employees trust their employer to prepare them for the future of work.\nHowever, 63% feel at risk of burnout.Career pipelines also have tightened as\n72% of experienced workers say they plan to work past retirement age. Just\nover half (55%) of Gen Xers say opportunities to advance are limited because\nof longevity in the workplace.Better management of older workers is part of\ncreating shared value, believes Mercer. More than three-quarters (78%) of\nemployees want long-term financial planning, yet just 23% of companies say\nthey provide financial education for employees today.\u201cOrganisations that\nsuccessfully navigate the turbulent times ahead will be those who champion\nempathy to maximise returns for all shareholders, employees and society\nalike,\u201d said Laura McKim, Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer.For\nmanagers and employers with a global and globally mobile workforce, employees\u2019\nmost-valued career support is personal and professional growth opportunities\n(73%) across most regions.In Asia, knowing what skills will become important\nor obsolete in the future tops the list (71%), while in Africa employees value\nmanagers who can have useful career conversations no matter their life stage\n(72%). The UK is aligned to the global trend in that 70% of employees feel\nthat their company gives them the space to learn and grow, both professionally\nand personally.Together, these data suggest the important role workplace and\ncareer [coaching](/articles/cipd-hr-cipd-2019-bringing-good-work-to-life-with-\ncoachingnovember-2019-rholmes) can have in supporting employees meet their\nprofessional goals.\n\n### 2\\. Race to reskill\n\nReskilling is the talent investment most capable of driving business success.\nAlmost every respondent organisation (99%) is embarking on transformation and\nreporting significant skill gaps.Workforce capability and lack of future\nskills was the top reason transformations failed. Although 78% of employees\nglobally say they are ready to learn new skills, 38% claim they do not have\nenough time for training.Moreover, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in\nworkforce learning and reskilling as part of their strategy to prepare for the\nfuture of work and 40% do not know what skills their workforce has today.\u201cJob\nrequirements are changing and the responsibility for upskilling, reskilling\nand redeployment needs to be shared between employers and employees,\u201d said\nLisa Lyons, UK Leadership and Workforce Transformation Practice Lead at\nMercer.\u201cWhere organisations see less demand for certain skills and increased\ndemand for others, they should look to identify people with transferable\nskills and provide reskilling opportunities.\u201dAcross regions, employees say\ninnovation will be the top in-demand skill in the next 12 months. HR leaders\nin North America and Latin America agree with their employees. The United\nKingdom follows this trend, with employees and HR leaders agreeing that\ninnovation is a top priority. Elsewhere, however, HR leaders put digital\nmarketing (Africa, Europe, Middle East, Pacific) and data visualisation at the\ntop (Asia).\n\n### 3\\. Sense with science\n\nAdvances in machine learning continue to permeate across industries and ways\nof life. The use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years\n(from 10% in 2016 to 39% today). Yet, only:\n\n  * 43% of organisations use metrics to identify employees likely to leave\n  * 41% know when critical talent is likely to retire\n  * 18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance\n  * 15% can determine if it is better to buy/build/borrow employees\n  * 12% are using analytics to correct inequities and prevent them recurring.\n\nOther forms of employee engagement data gathering are on the rise too. Six in\nten (62%) companies use pulse surveys and 33% plan to invest in this in\n2020.While machines outperform humans at tasks related to scale and speed,\nhumans outpace machines at sense-checking and judgement, which are critical\nelements of ethical decision-making.Two-thirds (67%) of HR leaders are\nconfident they can ensure AI is not institutionalising bias, ethics codes\nabout the collection. However, the application and implications of people\nanalytics are still in their infancy.Talent assessment is equally an area\nwhere human intuition is needed along with the digital assessments \u2013 only one\nin two employees (52%) report a positive assessment experience. \u201cThe\navailability of data and capability of analytics has increased but with great\ndata comes great responsibility, the challenge is for organisations to use it\neffectively to inform strategy through ethical means. The challenge for\ncompanies lies in balancing the protection of personal data and the\ninterrogation of this data to drive strategic decision making,\u201d said Laura\nMcKim, Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer.Across regions,\ndisconnects exist between the analytics the C-suite prioritises and those HR\nleaders provide. In the Pacific, 53% of HR leaders provide analytics on the\nC-suite\u2019s second top priority as to why one team is high performing and\nanother struggles. Yet, only 39% are providing analytics on the top priority\naround key drivers of engagement.In mature markets, like the United Kingdom,\nonly 49% are using analytics to identify the key drivers of pay inequities \u2013\nthe C-suite\u2019s top priority.\n\n### 4\\. Energising the employee experience\n\nDelivering on the employee experience is HR\u2019s top priority: 58% of\norganisations are redesigning to become more people-centric. Yet, only 27% of\nexecutives believe employee experience will yield a business return. There is\nalso a mismatch between the 61% of employees who trust their employer to look\nafter their well-being; and the 48% of executives who rank it as a top\nworkforce concern and 29% of HR leaders that a health and well-being strategy.\nThis is not an area to be missed, says Mercer, as employees whose company is\nfocused on employee health and well-being are four times more likely to be\nenergised.Energised employees are essential to realise organisations\u2019\ntransformation agenda: they are more likely to stay, more resilient and more\nready to reskill. HR transformation is high on organisations\u2019 agenda and\ndelivering on the employee experience requires HR to step out of its\nfunctional silos.However, only 40% of HR leaders say they have an integrated\npeople strategy. \u201cInteractions with employees matter, but often our focus on\nHR process and efficiency creates an unappealing candidate and employee\nexperience,\u201d said Laura McKim. \u201cOrganisations that approach the employee\nexperience in the same way they would the customer experience, where a premium\nis placed on employee interactions and system and process design comes second,\nwill have better success in engaging employees.\u201cNever more than now has\nplacing employees\u2019 interests at the heart of our businesses been more timely\nor important.\u201d Improving the employee experience tops HR\u2019s future of work\npriorities in Europe, North America and the Middle East, with the UK aligning\nwith this trend. Asia and Pacific put transforming talent practices\n(recruitment, performance management and succession) in the top spot.\n\n## Read more [talent management news and features](/talent-management) from\n_Relocate Global_\n\n* * *\n\n **[Subscribe to Relocate\nExtra](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/magazineregistration?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=reg),\nour monthly newsletter, to get all the latest international assignments and\nglobal mobility news.** **Relocate\u2019s new[Global Mobility\nToolkit](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-mobility-toolkit-download-\nour-preview-factsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtt)\nprovides free information, practical advice and support for HR, global\nmobility managers and global teams operating overseas.** **[![Global Mobility\nToolkit download factsheets resource centre](/media/images/RELO-GM-\nTOOLKIT-432x172-v2_12993_t5.jpg)](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-\nmobility-toolkit-download-our-preview-\nfactsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtbutton)**\n**[Access](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/directory?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=dir)\nhundreds of global services and suppliers in our Online Directory** **[![Click\nto get to the Relocate Global Online\nDirectory](/media/images/ScreenShot2016-09-20at171042_9694_t5.png)](/directory)**\n\n\u00a92020 Re:locate magazine, published by Profile Locations, Spray Hill, Hastings\nRoad, Lamberhurst, Kent TN3 8JB.

I think I was the only one in the\nbusiness out of 5-6000 people that had access to them all.\n\n\"My vision was to create a unified dataset so that we could do all of the\nfanciful analytical things that we needed to do, that we wanted to do, but we\njust couldn't [do because] we were hamstrung by our environment.\"\n\nThe result of that is All Insight, which Tabcorp started building in July last\nyear on an unnamed third-party vendor's technology.\n\nPart of the business case for All Insight was an internal finding that 44\npercent of Tabcorp's people leaders \"said that systems and processes don't\nsupport them to get their work done effectively.\"\n\nColvin also based the business case on saving \"every one of our managers one\nhour a week for a year\", which would collectively add up to 30,000 hours of\nfreed-up time.\n\n\"What would you do with an extra 30,000 hours? How would you reinvest that\ntime?,\" he said.\n\n\"I was asking for a moderate investment and there you have some sort of\nconcept or indicative return on investment.\"\n\nThe project was funded and the platform stood up from July last year in close\ncollaboration with Tabcorp subject matter experts and the chosen vendor, which\nTabcorp did not publicly name.\n\n\"By September, we had something to show,\" Colvin said.\n\n\"We'd already onboarded seven years of historical information from our core HR\nsystem. We had some performance ratings come through, we had various other\nintegrations with our employee listening platform.\n\n\"It wasn't perfect, but we wanted to test it.\"\n\nTabcorp ran a \"high velocity pilot experience\" with 30 leaders from across the\nbusiness over a three week period.\n\n\"We were trying to test whether or not it was useful, whether or not they\nunderstood what we were doing, whether or not they could use it in their job\nas a leader, whether or not it saved them time and whether or not they could\ntake an action based off it,\" he said.\n\n\"Insights without action is just information and it's basically a waste of\ntime.\"\n\nFrom this, Tabcorp then put in a further three months preparing All Insight\nfor a full rollout, which started in January this year.\n\n\"We onboarded more data, we implemented new business logic, we built new\nmetrics, we re-evaluated the way that we positioned our storyboards, we looked\nat all of that user feedback that we collected and we basically repackaged\nit,\" Colvin said.\n\n\"We got to about Christmas [which is when] we finally felt ready that we had a\nproduct that we could take to our market, our 600-700 leaders.\"\n\nThe interface contains information such as the number of people on the payroll\nat any given time, as well as metrics around the workforce such as training\ncompletion, turnover, and employee recognition, with the ability to then drill\ndown into the source data.\n\nColvin said Tabcorp started by training leaders at satellite offices in the\nNorthern Territory, Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia.\n\nIt has since run sessions for NSW leaders, and is \"right in the throes of the\nQueensland and Victoria rollout.\"\n\nColvin said early figures showed \"33 percent of our leaders have logged into\nthe platform in the last three weeks - a pretty stellar achievement.\"\n\nThat meant usage had grown from 30 in the pilot to around 220 leaders, he\nsaid.\n\nThe ability for leaders to self-serve data and insights on their teams meant\nthat Colvin and his small people analytics team could focus on higher value-\nadding work.\n\n\"The beauty of this tool is you can cut the data any which way you want, so\nI'm no longer wrangling spreadsheets,\" he said.\n\n\"[Instead], we've got people leaders across our organisational structure\n[that] now have information at their fingertips across a number of key\nmetrics.\n\n\"The upside is it frees up P&C [People & Culture's] time to be providing more\ninsights \u2026 and it gives me time to work on some of the more advanced\nanalytical things.\"\n\nHe continued: \"At the end of the day in HR, we can't control the behaviours or\nthe exact activities of nearly 6000 workers. That's the job of our leaders,\nand we're trusting them to do that.\n\n\"We're fostering a culture of self-service for our leaders as well. This is at\ntheir fingertips, they can log in from anywhere that they want. It's online,\nthey don't have to do anything to get this information.\"\n\nColvin said All Insight could also be augmented with more data that enabled\nTabcorp to properly see how people-related decisions impacted the business.\n\n\"My utopia around all of this is let's consolidate the information that we\nhave on our people - let's put it all in one place and leverage machine\nlearning and all the fanciful analytics - but then let's go and talk to other\nparts of the business,\" he said.\n\n\"Who runs our customer data set? Who's got access to the financials?\n\n\"If you can then substantiate the impact that an HR initiative has on the\ncustomer outcomes that your business is interested in, and the financial\nimpact that has, you've really got a great story to tell.\n\n\"I think that's the utopia that all of us in people analytics seem to be\nchasing.

Know the data points to\ncollect and how-to bring HR transformation.\n\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.itproportal.com/features/technology-in-hr-are-you-asking-the-right-questions/)\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Technology%20in%20HR%3A%20Are%20you%20asking%20the%20right%20questions%3F&url=https://www.itproportal.com/features/technology-in-hr-are-you-asking-the-right-questions/)\n  * [ __](whatsapp://send?text=Technology%20in%20HR:%20Are%20you%20asking%20the%20right%20questions?https://www.itproportal.com/features/technology-in-hr-are-you-asking-the-right-questions/?fwa)\n  * [ __](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.itproportal.com/features/technology-in-hr-are-you-asking-the-right-questions/&media=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a4prDj5rZ6naQgnnRVKU3K-1200-80.jpg)\n  * [ __](mailto:?subject=I%20found%20this%20webpage&body=Hi,%20I%20found%20this%20webpage%20and%20thought%20you%20might%20like%20it%20https://www.itproportal.com/features/technology-in-hr-are-you-asking-the-right-questions/)\n\n__ Shares\n\n![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a4prDj5rZ6naQgnnRVKU3K-320-80.jpg)\n\n(Image credit: Image Credit: MK photograp55 / Shutterstock)\n\nTechnology has the attention of human resources. What\u2019s next? The majority of\nbusinesses and HR departments now recognise the strategic importance of using\ntechnology in their operations. Many, however, are still figuring out how.\n\nA thumb rule of successfully using new-age technologies like AI in HR is \u2013\nimproving your data. Technology can only be as strong as the information that\npowers it. Banking on the right information not as simple as pushing a button.\n\nSourcing the data and managing it has to become a core function of human\nresources, for HR tech to work its magic on company processes. Workforce\nanalytics isn\u2019t new. Great line HR mangers have always analysed employee data\nto inform their decisions. Technology tools have expedited, streamlined and\nautomated the process.\n\nWhat then are the roadblocks to adoption of AI, Machine Learning and\nBlockchain in HR? Do you have quality data?\n\nThe benefit of taking a technology approach can be highly limited by the\nquantity and quality of data available.\n\nSay, you want to predict which of your present employees would make a good\nsalesperson. In no circumstance, can you answer that without ample data on\nemployees\u2019 performance, their preferences and capabilities, and the\ncharacteristics of a salesperson that benefit your business? Add to it that\nyou need significant data points to come up with a universal answer (that\napplies to all employees and your business needs).\n\nCommon roadblocks to bringing about HR transformation through technology are\nlimited data, hesitant leaders, shortage of resources to work on data, and\nregulatory restrictions. However, the need for quality data trumps it all.\nWithout it, no real change is possible.\n\n  * [Blockchain is set to transform the foundation of business](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-set-to-transform-the-foundation-of-business/)\n\n## Toward HR Technology: Busting the limitations\n\nEfficient data management should primarily include three practices:\n\n  * pinpointing right sourcing points\n  * consistent data definitions, and\n  * data entry and cleaning culture (a feat in itself).\n\nThe better these practices are engraved in your functioning, the more data you\nwill generate and its quality will be rich to be used for informing decisions\nand automating processes with accuracy.\n\nAs a starting point, we explore the data points three of the much talked about\nnew-age technologies \u2013 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and\nBlockchain \u2013 need to improve your productivity. They are not all-inclusive,\nbut indicators to get HR managers started.\n\n **Must-have Data Points for HR: In AI, Machine Learning & Blockchain**\n\n## AI in HR\n\nArtificial Intelligence is complex technology. It feeds on data, and get\nsmarter as more data is given to it. AI can learn and based on the learning;\nit can act independently without the need for human intervention. The only\ncondition being: it needs data. More and more people should submit their data\nfor AI to perform tasks with accuracy.\n\nGreater and 'relevant\u2019 data are the foundations to make AI systems smarter and\nseamless. It applies to HR tech too.\n\nWhen can you use AI? When there is a task that can be automated.\n\nExploring the objectives human resource professionals can fulfil with AI; and\nessential data points.\n\nObjectives of AI in HR:\n\n  * [Blockchain is going institutional \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-going-institutional-and-thats-a-good-thing/)\n\n  * Employee Learning. Based on employee\u2019s preferences and performance, AI system can give training (online or offline) recommendations.\n  * Enrolling for benefits. AI can check eligibility and approve one for the benefits.\n  * Initiating a retirement. An Exit process can be made easier and automated with AI.\n  * Managing leaves. AI can decrease leaves, adjust them, and resolve related queries, based on embedded algorithms.\n  * Source candidates. Based on what talent works and what doesn\u2019t for a business, the process of targeting and inviting the right candidates can be automated.\n  * Resume screening and detecting anomalies. AI can sift through the barrage of resumes with high accuracy and less bias.\n  * Detecting employee attrition. AI HR tech can detect patterns of even the slow withdrawal of employees from the business process.\n\nData points to look out for:\n\n  * Performance reviews\n  * Experiences, skills, and qualifications desired\n  * Employee exit metrics\n  * Absenteeism\n\n## Machine learning in HR\n\nMachine learning is under AI umbrella. AI can create intelligent machines that\ncan think like humans, machine learning allows machines to learn from data.\n\nML can help human resources draw conclusions and show a correlation between\ndata points.\n\nFor instance, OLX Group identified flight risk markers with machine learning.\nAggregating data from previous years, it reached the conclusion that\ncompleting a 12-month mark, and working in a unit that\u2019s below-average\nsatisfaction levels are two prominent flight risk markers.\n\nWhen is machine learning used? Drawing conclusions from myriad data points.\nThe use of AI and ML, however, is bleeding into each other.\n\nObjectives of Machine Learning in HR:\n\n  * Staffing\n  * Employee engagement\n  * Finding out if higher training benefits are preferred over average spike in salary by employees?\n  * Employee retention\n\nData Points to look out for:\n\n  * Round the season sales. Figure out the shopping season for your business. Use this to augment your staffing needs and scheduling processes\n  * Foot traffic. Can figure if a particular event (road closure or other externalities) led to ore footfall, and how you fared with respect to your competitor\n  * Others mentioned in the section on AI in HR\n\n## Blockchain in HR\n\nBlockchain is yet to scale in HR tech. Less than five per cent of\norganisations presently use blockchain in human resources. The tech can,\nhowever, gain prominence in recruiting and data protection, as the talent war\nand calls for the privacy of data becomes louder.\n\nObjectives of Blockchain in HR:\n\n  * Data privacy and security\n  * Resume verification\n  * Financial management\n  * Protecting the intellectual property of the business\n\nData Points to look out for: It\u2019s not data point as much as creating an\nenvironment for confidentiality that\u2019s important to implement blockchain tech\nin HR. Proofing recruiting, and maintaining data confidentiality is where\nblockchain can give confidence to companies and HR managers.\n\n **HR Transformation: How do you collect data?**\n\nOther than KPIs there are many valuable metrics that can be collected by HR to\nimprove processes.\n\nPulse surveys, discussion forums, suggestion boxes, thinking workshops,\ncandidate resumes, performance reviews, and other such sources can be used to\ncollect desired data. Instead of undertaking data collection when the need\narises, the data tap should remain open. Much better if you can place a team\nto structure and clean it (the overarching goals and objectives for which will\nhave to be provided by you).\n\nGamification is another novel method. Crunchr in Netherlands uses 16 question\ngames to find what employees\u2019 value most in their workplace \u2013 covering salary,\nbenefits, career growth, the security of job, engagement, and other aspects.\nThe game is anonymous (except for collecting basic information such as\nacademic level, experience, gender, etc.) that ensures participation.\nPreference groups based on different sub-groups are then formed from the\nresults.\n\nAsking the right questions is key to unravel the potential of HR Technology.\nThe best questions are those that led to insights!\n\n  * [Blockchain: Is it the future of FinTech?](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-it-the-future-of-fintech/)\n\n _Ariaa Reeds, writer_\n\n### Topics\n\n[technology](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/technology/)\n\n[hr](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/hr/)\n\n[human resources](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/human-resources/)\n\n[artificial intelligence](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/artificial-\nintelligence/)\n\n[machine learning](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/machine-learning/)\n\n[blockchain](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/blockchain/)\n\n__Get Weekly News and Analysis\n\nSign up below to get the latest from ITProPortal, plus exclusive special\noffers, direct to your inbox!\n\nNo spam, we promise.

When Employees hear \u201cPeople First\u201d messages and they feel they\nare valued we deepen our connections. By asking questions like, \u201cWhat can we\ndo to improve your life\u201d and then seeking solutions to meet those needs, we\nbuild trust. When employees trust their leaders and their organization, they\ncare more about outcomes because they feel we are in it together. When\nemployees care about outcomes, they perform better, they bring forward\ninnovative ideas and they start seeking opportunities to raise the bar. This\ntype of symbiotic relationship is how organizations lift themselves up to\nhigher levels of performance while improving the lives of their people both\ninside and outside the workplace.\n\n**Brian:** It is such a great time to be an HR leader and professional. Now\nmore than ever business leaders realize the difference between thriving and\nwithering in today\u2019s world of change are the people you engage to solve\nproblems for customers or stakeholders. Technology has democratized access to\ntalent. However, technology alone is not the key enabler. It is how employees\nand our extended workforce (contingent, contract, etc) connect to the mission\nof the organization and the value proposition of contributing to the success\nof the business. Though technology allows companies access to new talent it\nalso allows the talent to find a better fit for their goals and aspirations.\nWe, as HR leaders, need to find ways to consistently connect individuals to\nthe organization in ways that help them be at their best.\n\n**Greg:** I think people are the number one resource for any company and they\nare becoming scarcer. So, investing in them and making your people feel valued\nare critical to any business. To improve the outcome, find ways to connect the\ninvestment to both their personal gain and the impact it has on your\norganization. Creating the purpose for that investment helps both engagement\nand sustainability for it.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Trends Shaping the Future of\nWork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/4-trends-\nshaping-the-future-of-work/)**  \n  \n\n**_HR Technologist: What are the top 3 techniques to manage a global, mobile\nworkforce inclusively?_**\n\n**Barbie:** I have found it both necessary and effective to use tools to help\npeople feel connected. Internally we rely heavily on video conferencing.\nSeeing your teams faces, their responses and expressions help build\nconnections. With 70% of communication being non-verbal, it is incredibly\nimportant to have the ability to both hear and see folks when meeting.\n\nRecognizing people live within the traditions and social norms of their\ngeography and cultures, it is important we recognize and celebrate what makes\nus unique and is important to us. Every year, we survey our employees around\nthe globe and ask them to share with us what\u2019s important to them. We ask them\nto share with us the holidays, events and celebrations they recognize, and we\nthen share this information out with our entire population throughout the year\nas the holidays occur. We provide education around different holidays, how\nthey originated, why they have meaning and who celebrates them.\n\nWe make significant efforts to include our remote workers in company\ncelebrations and activities. When we have costume dress-up days or theme days,\nwe collect photos of remote workers and share them in Town Hall meetings, on\nour Employee Resource Hub, and in our employee newsletter.\n\n**Brian:** We must remember it takes work to stay connected to a global and\nmobile workforce inclusively. We must avoid defaulting to email, text, or\ninternal social media channels as our primary way of communicating. It is\nimportant to use technologies that allow virtual face to face communication on\na regular basis. It also important to be prepared by keeping one on one\nmeetings, holding development only discussions, keeping up with personal\nachievements and milestones for staff. Many managers fail to remember that\ntheir staff on the move should be factored in meetings and what types of\ncommunications can be utilized. Ensuring that all team members have a voice in\nthe conversation is very important. Careful thought is needed to ensure\neveryone has access and a chance to contribute. Seeking input from those who\nare quieter is a simple technique, but it often is the least utilized.\n\n**Greg:** Communicate often, I mean a lot! Vary the size and form of\ncommunication. Not everything needs to be in a long memo. Short/quick e-mails\nwork. Phone calls, WebEx, and even texting can work well. Our CEO does a\nweekly voice recorded message so you can hear his voice.\n\nEstablish a cadence and consistency to communication. I like to do a Friday\nweekly recap to my Team. It includes a few highlights for our Team. Shout-outs\nto members that did something good. A look forward to the next week and then a\nwhere am I note so they know if I am in the office, traveling, or just in a\nlot of meetings.\n\nExpand your reach, it is very easy to ask questions, solicit input, and ask\nfor help on a key assignment to those closest to you in proximity. You must be\ndiligent in reaching out to others to keep them connected and to feel\nincluded.\n\n**Learn More:[Future of Work: 10 Key Trends for the Next 10\nYears](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/future-\nof-work-key-trends/)**\n\n**_HR Technologist: How can HR managers build a successful business case to\ninvest in HR tech that facilitates diversity and inclusion?_**\n\n**Barbie:** Understanding your culture, your people and all the ways in which\nprejudice and bias show up in the workplace is the starting off point for\ndetermining what, if any tech can help facilitate diversity & inclusion within\nyour organization. I believe starting at the very front end of your process,\nis a smart way to begin laying the groundwork from robust D&I.; Asking\nyourself and your teams questions like, \u201cWhat recruitment marketing messages\nare we sending? How thoughtful are we being in developing our imagery and\nverbiage? Is our selection process providing equal opportunity for all\ncandidates? Are we intentionally seeking diverse platforms and communicates?\u201d\nEnsuring the job posting verbiage is gender-neutral and not slanted is\nincredibly important. There are technology solutions out there to help with\nmany of these aspects of the hiring process, and to me, that\u2019s where a company\nshould start.\n\n**Brian:** Organizations that rely on traditional methods of communication and\nconnectivity may not operate at the speed of business. Technology allows\nleaders to tap into a broader population of staff or extended resources.\nGiving more team members, more information, in a transparent way allows more\ncontribution. Our tools help us diagnose employee matters more effectively and\nsee trends that perhaps we wouldn\u2019t see through our typical observations. The\nreturn on investment starts with the belief that if you hire great people who\nare diverse in many ways why wouldn\u2019t we invest in their ability to\ncontribute? Technology improves our access to diverse talent and it also helps\nus find ways to engage our staff more effectively.\n\n**Greg:** It is about getting to a series of yes answers to basic questions:\n\n  1. Is D&I; important to your organization and why? If the answer is yes, then how are you doing? If you are not where you want to be than you move to the next set of questions.\n  2. The next is about getting agreement on what the issues are. What is the root cause, barriers, and roadblocks to reaching you goal? The yes you are wanting to get to be can a tool/technology help with the issues identified? If yes, move to the next one.\n  3. How will this technology help? What can it do that you can\u2019t already do? How does help make decisions, etc? If yes, move to the next.\n  4. Is the size of the impact meaningful? How far will it move the needle for you? Is it worth the investment? Hoping for a yes here.\n  5. Lastly, show how you will measure success and the impact of the technology.\n\n**_HR Technologist: What's your take on the use of AI in HR tech?_**\n\n**Barbie:** As I have been quoted before saying, and will repeat again, I love\ntechnology and respect what it can do at the same time I recognize what it\ncannot do. We all know the HR space has lagged a bit in having robust\ntechnology solutions, and now it seems space has exploded with more tech\nsolutions than I have ever seen before. You can find a tech offering for\nabsolutely every possible issue or concern you may have. Technology cannot fix\nculture and technology cannot replace leaders. My concern with some tech\nofferings is the promise to solve your culture struggles and leadership gaps,\nand we all know that simply will not happen. Adding tech into a broken\nculture, a broken process or poor leadership space will only further dilute\nand confuse the issues. Where I see AI benefitting the HR space is in the\ntactical areas of supporting employee questions around Total Rewards, Employee\nRelations, and policy, perhaps through chat functions to allow these teams to\nfocus on solutions rather than responding to a multitude of the same questions\nday in and day out. I can also see a benefit in using AI to analyze data and\nfind themes and underlying issues we may not see at first pass. I hesitate to\ngo too deeply into AI within the people space until we really understand the\nlong-term implications of how these tools help or hurt the culture of an\norganization. I have seen tech do wonders in improving connectivity and I have\nseen tech drive huge chasms within organizations. I always believe it\u2019s best\nto map out exactly what you are trying to solve, ensure your organization has\nthe people infrastructure, culture and leadership to support the initiative\nand then select the technology to help bring the solution to life.\nUnfortunately, I have seen for too many HR leaders select a tech solution\nbased on an excellent sales pitch without the structures in place and it\nsimply becomes anther failed HR initiative and waste of time, money and\ncredibility.\n\n**Brian:** AI, as it relates to HR, is here to stay. As the cost for AI goes\ndown and the use cases become more apparent more HR leaders will use AI for\nproblem-solving. Utilizing the robotics for gathering, sorting and maintaining\ndata or managing processes is becoming more common. This will lead to AI tools\nthat assist beyond problem diagnosis. AI tools will begin to suggest solutions\nfor implementation. This will help HR speed up and contribute more to the\nsuccess of organizations. AI tools will not replace human judgment in the\nshorter term, but they will make us smarter and allow us to concentrate on\nproblems that are the most important.\n\n**Greg:** It is a double-edged sword for sure. I am not a fan of using it to\nmake hiring decisions. I think way too much can go wrong including the\ncommoditizing of recruiting and Recruiters. The value is in eliminating highly\nadministrative and routine actions and interactions with HR. Thus, freeing up\nyour Team to spend more time with candidates or employees that need it and on\nother actions that bring a higher ROI. Creating space for candidates and\nemployees to self-serve and get common questions answered quickly.\n\n**Learn More:[People Analytics: Building a Data-driven HR\nfunction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/people-\nanalytics-building-a-datadriven-hr-function/)**\n\n**_Interested in attending the HR Insight Summit on Jun. 10-12, 2020 at\nArizona, USA?_** ** _Hear Barbie Winterbottom, Brian Little, and Greg Muccio\nspeak live about investing in people and managing diversity in the workplace,\nat the summit.

That is only going\nto continue to intensify as L&D leaders and HR as a whole continue to grapple\nwith challenges related to the future of work.\n\nTo that end, Dana Palmblad and Roben Graziadei, segment directors for\nLeadership and Professional Development with Kaplan, will explore how\n[technology and\ndata](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/articles/workplace-learning-\ntechnologies) can be utilized to identify business challenges in order to\nprioritize your learning investments.  As part of HR Exchange Network's [HR\nand Future of Work](https://bit.ly/2WtVMp8) online event, the two will discuss\nhow this information can be used to create consistency and alignment, improve\nbusiness acumen, and develop better decision-making skills.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/dana_palmblad_headshot_2019_07_03__1_.jpg)\n|\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/graziadei_5x7_color_print_a.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \nDana Palmblad\n\n_Segment Director for Leadership and Professional Development_\n\n**Kaplan**\n\n|\n\nRoben Graziadei\n\n_Segment Director for Leadership and Professional Development_\n\n**Kaplan**  \n  \nBelow is an interview I conducted with the team from Kaplan about the topic\nand a preview of the online event planned for March 24-25, 2020.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nMake the business case for me - why use data in learning and development?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nThe right data can help you prioritize your learning, to focus in areas where\nit is needed most and ensure the most effective use of your learning\ninvestment.  It provides a pre and post-assessment to measure the\neffectiveness of learning and training initiatives.  Importantly, we will also\ndiscuss an approach that goes beyond typical approaches that only provide\npass/fail results, to provide a much better predictor of behavior.  We will\nexplore the use of data that measures a person's level of understanding - and\nhow their knowledge is being applied within the context of the work they do\nevery day.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nL&D leaders are under pressure to achieve results.  How can a data-driven\napproach help?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\n[Leveraging the right\ndata](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/articles/learning-metrics-to-\nlive-by), L&D can clearly identify the value drivers and KPIs needed to ensure\nfocus on business activities that will have a meaningful business impact,\ncreating better alignment with business goals and objectives.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nWhile metrics are different from organization to organization, generally\nspeaking, what metrics should all L&D leaders track?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nL&D leaders should measure the effectiveness of initiatives that are tied to\nthe businesses' strategic goals and objectives and integrated with\nprofessional development performance metrics/review. Asking two questions:\n\n  1. Are learning initiatives aligned with overall business objectives to drive results?\n  2. Are there meaningful KPIs in place to measure the expected/needed behavioral changes needed, to ensure learning is not just an \"event,\" but is creating sustained performance improvement?\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nKaplan takes a two-dimensional diagnostic approach in that it measures\ncompetence and confidence.  Why these specific dimensions and what is gained?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nPeople development should focus on both skills and behavior - this is a well-\nknown concept. Our diagnostic translates skills into measures of competence\nand the ability to apply these skills with confidence. This provides a clearer\npicture of where you have hidden talent or possible performance gaps and\nallows you to tailor learning to the individual, team or the entire\norganization.  Unlike other assessments, Kaplan's unique diagnostic tool is an\nonline assessment that creates real-life scenarios, providing participants\nwith decisions that are relevant to their work and asking them to determine if\na given response is true or false.  Additionally, they are asked to rate how\nconfident they are in their answer.\n\nThis confidence measure provides insight into their level of understanding;\ntheir ability to make the right decisions in their day-to-day work.  The\nresulting data provides heat maps and other reports provide a foundation for\nidentifying hidden talent and uncovering risk; the ability to develop\npersonalized learning interventions that align behavior with corporate goals\nand objectives to drive better individual, group and corporate performance.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nHow can diagnostics and assessments be utilized to identify risk?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nThe data provided from this diagnostic identifies areas where individuals have\nindicated they would make the wrong decision in a given situation, but\nstrongly believe their decision is correct.  This indicates areas of risk that\nneed to be addressed.  Providing heat maps and other reports that show this\ninformation on an individual, group or organizational level, allows L&D to\ncreate learning initiatives that are targeted to the greatest area of need.\n\nIt can help you identify skill gaps that could impact whether or not the\ncompany meets its strategic business goals and objectives.  Not prioritizing\nlearning initiatives related to these areas could hinder the company's ability\nto meet its goals and objectives.  Mason Stevenson\n\nWhat about learning investments?  How can diagnostics and assessments drive\nthose?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nWhere many organizations struggle to allocate training investments solely\nbased on budgets that are intended to cover a wider range of areas; often\nfocused primarily on \"High Performance\" candidates, etc., Diagnostics provide\nthe ability to more accurately assess the learning needs and invest in the\npeople and groups with the greatest need.  This provides for real\ndemocratization of learning - to develop the skills and behaviors needed\nacross the business - at all levels, to drive more consistent overall\nperformance improvement.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nHidden talent?  Can data help find those \"diamonds in the rough\"?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nYes, a diagnostic heat map can reveal individuals with high competence but low\nconfidence in a specific competency or skill.  A tailored learning journey\n(perhaps coaching the employee) can be designed to specifically address talent\nand/or confidence gaps.\n\n**Mason Stevenson**\n\nCan a diagnostic/data-driven approach help in other areas?  In succession\nplanning, for instance, or leadership development?\n\n**Kaplan**\n\nYes, by working with an organization we are able to identify development needs\nin these areas and others, whether for a functional population or to address\nspecific organizational challenges.  For example, we are all facing change at\na rapid pace today, with more and more people required to work from home. This\nis challenging for the business, leaders and employees. The ability to present\nreal decision points for everyone as they adapt to changing processes,\ntechnology and work environments, helps identify where people need the most\nsupport. This helps leadership to respond with key messaging and tailored\nlearning journeys that specifically address these needs.\n\n\n\n_Dana Palmblad and Roben Graziadei, segment directors for leadership and\nprofessional development with Kaplan, will speak on March 25, 2020 at 1:30p\nET.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=133950&preview=true)\n\nGiorgio Benassi, Head of talent acquisition \u2013 global production and global\nhuman resources business partner at H&M Group, shares his five-year journey\nwith the global fashion empire and his thoughts on talents in Asia and Europe.\n\n**How would you describe your journey with the H &M group so far? **  \nIt has been a fantastic learning journey, especially around leadership and\nculture. Recently, double- hatting as the global HR business partner, I still\nfeel like my journey at H&M is (closer to) starting than finishing. I have\nbeen here for five years, and there is always something new on the horizon.\n\nThe most memorable moment was meeting CEO Helena Helmersson at a meeting,\nwhere I truly understood what H&M leadership was about. After my presentation,\nI started to compliment her for her achievements at H&M, and in only five\nminutes, she turned the conversation completely on me such as my qualities,\nand how positively my contribution was to the group. When I realised that, I\nstopped and asked her: \u201cHelena, how to you do this? How do you make something\nthat is supposedly to be about you and you make it about me, in such a\npositive way?\u201d\n\n**Having worked across Europe and Hong Kong, what differences do you observe \u2013\nin terms of talent, the pace of change and transformation?**  \nThe pace of the career journey of an Asian talent is very fast, sometimes even\na bit overwhelming. Hong Kong is a quite mature market, but in Mainland China,\nif one strategically plans their career steps, it is not difficult at all to\nmove up the ranks in just a few years. Talent in Europe can also have a fast-\npaced career, but one needs to be really outstanding.\n\n> ##### **This is all due to the economy, not because of the culture. As the\n> economy in Asia is still growing, companies need more talent. **\n\nApart from that, candidate expectations between the two regions also differ.\nThe majority of talent in Asia expect new opportunities from employers, and\nmoney plays an important factor. Europe, on the other hand, is a candidate-\ndriven market. Talent are concerned more\nabouthowtheywillbetreatedandhowinformation is delivered to them. As the Asian\njob market is evolving, talent nowadays have started looking for work-life\nbalance.\n\n**Describe your leadership style**  \nIt\u2019s based on three pillars. First: Authenticity. I am very much who I am at\nwork. People see who I am, both good and bad. This creates a fantastic\nconnection with colleagues.\n\nThe second pillar would be empowerment. I delegate a lot, mostly conceptual\nprojects. I am always there to steer and support, but I allow them to come up\nwith ideas. It empowers people to leverage the competency they have.\n\nThe last one would be creating a light-hearted experience.\n\n> ##### **We need to do our best, but also with a smile. **\n\nAs a leader, I aspire to shelter teams from the overwhelming stress that can\ncome with the corporate world and maintain a light-hearted spirit \u2013 so I can\nput them into the position that they can perform their best work.\n\n**What HR trends should talent acquisition specialists be aware of?**  \nImprove their communication skills, if they are not already excellent, and be\naware of what goes on in the world of tech \u2013 what tech can do for them and how\nthey can optimise it. There is an increasingly strong need for authenticity\nand individualisation \u2013 meaning candidates or clients expect something that is\nnot generic. People want to be seen as who they are, and TA needs to find ways\nto connect with them.\n\nTechnology will be a fantastic enabler of these human relationships. Soon, we\nwill reach a point where we will trust algorithms to do certain parts of our\nselection process. The role of recruiters will then become more mature. They\nwill leverage their human side and strengthen the relationship with\ncandidates.\n\n[Hong Kong HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/26110531/Aditi-Mar-2020-thailand-pm-prd-\nwebsite-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[Thailand declares state of emergency effective 26 March 2020: Everything we\nknow so far](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/thailand-declares-state-of-\nemergency-effective-26-march-2020-everything-we-know-so-far/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/26110811/sam-mar-suite-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[\u62db\u8058\u4eba\u54e1\u61c9\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u5169\u5927\u4eba\u529b\u8cc7\u6e90\u8da8\u52e2](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/%e6%8b%9b%e8%81%98%e4%ba%ba%e5%93%a1%e6%87%89%e6%b3%a8%e6%84%8f%e7%9a%84%e5%85%a9%e5%a4%a7%e4%ba%ba%e5%8a%9b%e8%b3%87%e6%ba%90%e8%b6%a8%e5%8b%a2/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n06/29/2018 Fri 10:49 AM in All markets by [Aditi Sharma\nKalra](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/aditis/ \"Posts by Aditi\nSharma Kalra\")\n\n## [HR job moves of the week from The Body Shop, AIA, and\nmore](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/hr-job-moves-of-the-week-from-the-\nbody-shop-aia-bupa-and-more/ \"HR job moves of the week from The Body Shop,\nAIA, and more\")\n\nYour weekly update on job movements in HR - featuring changes from K.

But when data\nbecomes a core asset, the need for careful data governance becomes even more\npressing.\n\n![What Are The Pitfalls Of People Analytics And Data-Driven HR?\n](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e438d95a854780006b11117/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nWhat Are The Pitfalls Of People Analytics And Data-Driven HR?\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nToday\u2019s HR teams potentially have access to huge amounts of data, and this can\nbring great rewards for those who use that data intelligently. But, data also\nbrings its own unique challenges. Therefore, before implementing any data-\ndriven HR approach, it\u2019s important to consider the potential pitfalls that\nsurround employee-related data, particularly when it comes to their personal\ndata.\n\n**Data privacy**\n\nObviously, HR teams need to operate within the data privacy laws of their\ncountry. Here in the UK, unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019ll know\nthat personal employee data comes under GDPR \u2013 General Data Protection\nRegulation \u2013 which comes into effect in May 2018. I talk more about this in my\narticle \u2018[ _What GDPR means for HR teams_\n\u2019](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1430\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1430\"), but suffice to say\nthat GDPR will impact the way HR teams gather, store and work with employee\ndata.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about GDPR is how it cracks down on companies that take a\nlaissez-faire approach to data privacy. Companies that fail to properly\nprotect employees\u2019 personal data, or are found to be misusing personal data,\nface stiff fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual worldwide turnover,\nwhichever is the greater of the two.\n\nToday In: [Enterprise Tech](https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n### This Emergency Communications Startup Just Raised $15 Million Amid A\nCOVID-19 Boom\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/04/07/this-emergency-\ncommunications-startup-just-raised-15-million-amid-a-covid-19-boom/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Google Starts To Publish Coronavirus Mobility Reports\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2020/04/07/google-starts-to-\npublish-coronavirus-mobility-reports/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Is \u2018Management By Walking Around\u2019 Still Possible When Everything Is\nDigital And Remote?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2020/04/06/is-management-by-\nwalking-around-still-possible-when-everything-is-digital-and-remote/)\n\n **Protecting against data breaches**\n\nAmidst this harsher regulatory landscape (not to mention the reputational\nfallout of high-profile data breaches), HR data must be properly secured and\nprotected from threats. If you think that no one would be interested in\nstealing your employee-related data (as opposed to, say, customer credit card\ndetails), think again. It may surprise you to know that [medical data is 10\ntimes more valuable to criminals than credit card\ndata](https://cyberpolicy.com/cybersecurity-education/why-medical-records-\nare-10-times-more-valuable-than-credit-card-info\n\"https://cyberpolicy.com/cybersecurity-education/why-medical-records-\nare-10-times-more-valuable-than-credit-card-info\"). So the lesson is: if it\ncontains personally identifiable information, data of any kind can be\nvaluable.\n\nBut hoodied criminal hackers trading data on the dark web aren\u2019t the only\nsource of data breaches. The insider threat (whether malicious or through\nsheer ineptitude) is huge. In one example, a Boeing employee [inadvertently\ncaused a breach that might have exposed the personal data of 36,000 Boeing\nemployees](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/technology/pages/boeing-insider-data-breach-serves-as-reminder-for-\nhr.aspx \"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/technology/pages/boeing-insider-data-breach-serves-as-reminder-for-\nhr.aspx\"), including their names, date of births, and social security numbers.\nHow? The unlucky employee was having trouble formatting a spreadsheet, so he\nsent it on to his spouse for help, unaware that the spreadsheet contained\nhidden columns with confidential information.\n\nIn another example, a disgruntled employee of British supermarket Morrisons\n[deliberately exposed colleagues\u2019 personal data\nonline](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/morrisons-liable-\nstaff-data-leak-landmark-decision\n\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/morrisons-liable-staff-data-\nleak-landmark-decision\"). In a landmark High Court case, the supermarket was\nfound liable for the breach. Just imagine the consequences of such a breach\nwhen GDPR is in effect. The damage to a business\u2019s finances and reputation\ncould be catastrophic.\n\n**Understanding the ethical pitfalls**\n\nAs well as sitting on the right side of the law, HR teams also need to ensure\ntheir data usage sits within the company\u2019s ethical boundaries. Most companies\nthese days emphasize a culture of openness and honesty. If your data-driven HR\nactivities fly in the face of that culture \u2013 for example, by clumsily\nimplementing data projects or poorly communicating how data is used \u2013 it could\nlead to massive morale and trust issues.\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the key pieces of advice I give to businesses is this:\n_transparency_. Transparency around what employee data is being collected,\ntransparency around why it\u2019s being collected, and transparency around how it\nwill be used.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to add value for employees and emphasize the positive\noutcomes of using their data. People are far happier for their data to be used\nwhen they feel they\u2019re getting something valuable in return, whether it\u2019s\nbetter working conditions, more effective management, a safer environment, or\nwhatever.\n\n**The importance of good governance**\n\nPracticing good data governance will help ensure your HR data remains a\nvaluable asset and doesn't turn into a liability. Here\u2019s a snapshot of what\ngood data governance means in practice:\n\n\u00b7         **Create data governance procedures (if you haven\u2019t already).** This\nmay include defining who owns the various people-related data within the\norganization, who is responsible for data accuracy, who is responsible for\ncontrolling access to the data, and who is responsible for updating the data.\nIt should also cover how the data can be used.\n\n\u00b7         **Get consent for employee data.** Consent is a critical pillar of\ndata privacy. This means HR must get employees\u2019 express permission in order to\ncollect and process their personal data. It used to be that consent was\nassumed as part and parcel of employment. Thanks to GDPR, that\u2019s no longer the\ncase.\n\n\u00b7         **Be strict about data usage.** GDPR means you can only use personal\ndata for the specific purpose for which consent was given. If you want to use\nthe data for a different purpose, new permission is needed. It\u2019s vital HR\ncolleagues fully understand this, as the fines for misusing data can be\nenormous.\n\n\u00b7         **Practice data minimization.** This means gathering only the very\nessential data, i.e., data that can help meaningfully improve the company and\nadd value. Data for data\u2019s sake is worthless, and can actually prove\ndetrimental to the company in the long run.\n\n\u00b7         **Anonymise data.** Wherever possible, you should anonymize personal\nemployee data, which means stripping it of any personal markers that link an\nindividual to that piece of information.\n\n\u00b7         **Protect and secure your data.** There are certain safeguards any\nbusiness can put in place to secure data and prevent breaches. Such measures\ncan include encrypting data, having systems in place to detect and stop\nbreaches while they\u2019re happening, and training staff so they never give away\nsecure information.\n\n  \n\nRead more about how HR teams can get the most out of data and analytics,\nwithout falling foul of the pitfalls, in my book [_Data-Driven\nHR_](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\") _._ It\u2019s packed with\nreal-life examples and practical ways HR teams can deliver maximum value in\nour increasingly data-driven world.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@bernardmarr) or\n[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr).

While there is understandable concern about\n[what this means for human jobs](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-\nelement-\ncse&cx=016722361883844155001:yfaatio9mvc&q=https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp%3FcontentID%3D1422&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi1puSC0L_nAhUGdBQKHbV6Bk4QFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw2W0Wc1XbKiSDXXe1pAzV0s\n\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-\ncse&cx=016722361883844155001:yfaatio9mvc&q=https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp%3FcontentID%3D1422&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi1puSC0L_nAhUGdBQKHbV6Bk4QFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw2W0Wc1XbKiSDXXe1pAzV0s\"),\nI still believe this is an exciting time for businesses \u2013 and the people who\nwork in them.\n\n![Future Of People Analytics: What Lies Ahead For Data-Driven\nHR?](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e463882a854780006b152eb/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nFuture Of People Analytics: What Lies Ahead For Data-Driven HR?\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nIntelligent, data-driven HR is transforming many aspects of how HR teams serve\nthe people in their organizations. The technology is changing fast, too \u2013\nfaster than even I would have anticipated five years ago. That means how HR\nteams function in just a few years\u2019 time will probably be very different\nagain. But, even amidst this uncertainty, some things are crystal clear about\nthe future of data-driven HR. Here are my top three predictions:\n\n**HR will have a unique role to play in this data- and AI-driven world**\n\nThe proliferation of data analytics, IoT-enabled devices, and AI tools is only\ngoing to continue, and this will carry on impacting the way HR works, just\nlike every other area of the business.\n\nToday In: [Enterprise Tech](https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n### This Emergency Communications Startup Just Raised $15 Million Amid A\nCOVID-19 Boom\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/04/07/this-emergency-\ncommunications-startup-just-raised-15-million-amid-a-covid-19-boom/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Google Starts To Publish Coronavirus Mobility Reports\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2020/04/07/google-starts-to-\npublish-coronavirus-mobility-reports/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Is \u2018Management By Walking Around\u2019 Still Possible When Everything Is\nDigital And Remote?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2020/04/06/is-management-by-\nwalking-around-still-possible-when-everything-is-digital-and-remote/)\n\nIn this changing environment, the challenge for HR teams is to find a balance\nbetween technology (particularly automation) and the human role in the\norganizations of the future. I believe the biggest challenge facing HR teams\ngoing forward is not keeping up with technology and learning new skills like\ndata analysis, it's finding the uniquely human place in the organization \u2013 and\nwithin the HR team itself.\n\nTherefore, the HR teams of today need to be thinking about what HR will look\nlike in the future, and this includes what exactly can be automated, and what\ncan\u2019t. They need to figure out HR\u2019s contribution to the workplace of the\nfuture.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll ever reach a point where [the HR function is\nentirely redundant](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-still-need-hr-teams-\nwhen-have-robots-ai-bernard-marr/ \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-still-\nneed-hr-teams-when-have-robots-ai-bernard-marr/\"). But the role of HR will\nundoubtedly shift away from the more administrative tasks around people\nmanagement (which can be easily automated in the future) to activities that\nhelp the organization meet its goals. It's vital that HR [delivers real\nvalue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/13/why-data-is-hrs-\nmost-important-asset/#4f41f7656b0f\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/13/why-data-is-hrs-most-\nimportant-asset/#4f41f7656b0f\") and unique benefits that cannot be delivered\nby any other function in the organization.\n\n**When it comes to coping with automation, HR must lead the way**\n\nThere\u2019s no escaping automation. It\u2019s therefore important for everyone, in\nevery job and every industry, to consider the implications of our increasingly\nautomated world, and how automation might affect their job and employment\nprospects over the coming years.\n\nFor HR teams, this is particularly pertinent. Not only are HR professionals\nfinding their own way in this new world, but they also have to equip the\npeople in their organization with the essential skills for helping the\nbusiness succeed in the future. So if you're an HR professional wondering how\non earth to navigate these changes, don\u2019t panic. These three steps will help\nyou figure out your unique role in the organization and boost your personal\ndevelopment.\n\n\u00b7         **Consider the future of your job:** Think hard about how much of\nwhat you do every day is repetitive and could potentially be done by\nintelligent algorithms or robots. It\u2019s now possible to completely or partially\nautomate many HR tasks. But the areas that computers still struggle with\ninclude creativity, problem-solving and connecting with people on a human\nlevel \u2013 all of which are vital skills in HR. These are the areas where HR can\nadd real value to the organization, so it makes sense to develop your skills\nin these areas and reshape your job to do more of the things that robots or\nalgorithms can\u2019t.\n\n\u00b7         **Become data-savvy:** You don\u2019t have to become a data scientist,\nbut it\u2019s important to have a good understanding of the [possibilities of\ndata](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/11/5-inspiring-ways-\norganizations-are-using-hr-data/#432d34518722\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/11/5-inspiring-ways-\norganizations-are-using-hr-data/#432d34518722\") and how it can help you solve\nproblems, be more efficient and make your employees happier. Demonstrating\nthat you can use data in original ways to solve key problems is a sure-fire\npath to success in the information age.\n\n\u00b7         **Make friends with your AI colleagues:** AI is being adopted at an\nincredible rate. We can see that with the huge popularity of AI assistants\nlike Alexa and Siri. This type of technology is fast becoming commonplace in\nour workplaces, too, which understandably makes people nervous. HR teams\nshould be leading the way in embracing AI technology and showing how\ncollaborating with AI systems can drive efficiencies and help the business\nsucceed.\n\n**The future is bright for intelligent, data-driven HR**\n\nI've worked with so many different HR teams over the years, and, in my\nexperience, the world of data and numbers isn't exactly what gets the average\nHR professional's heart racing. Most HR professionals go into the job because\nthey're intrinsically people focused \u2013 they're interested in human\ninteraction, not analyzing datasets. So, if you\u2019re concerned, you need to\nbecome a data scientist to keep your job, you can relax. I believe the\nopposite is true.\n\nThe great news is that a lot of the AI and machine learning tools coming onto\nthe market will allow us to automatically analyze HR data and generate\nvaluable insights. With the machines taking care of the data analysis and\ninsight generation, HR professionals can focus on what they do best: working\nwith people.\n\n  \n\nRead more about how data and analytics are transforming every aspect of HR,\nand what this means for the future, in my book [_Data-Driven\nHR_](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\") _._ It\u2019s packed with\nreal-life examples and practical ways HR teams can deliver maximum value in\nour increasingly data-driven world.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@bernardmarr) or\n[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr).

The top HR priorities for the next\ndecade will be to build critical skills, strengthen the leadership bench, and\nimplement organizational design and change management.\n\nWhile CHROs seem to be aware of these [pressing\nchallenges](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/articles/chro-pulse-survey-2019\n\"Research Link\"), research suggests that not many are [entirely confident of\ntackling them head-on](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pl/pdf/2019/05/pl-\nRaport-KPMG-The-future-of-HR-2019-In-the-Know-or-in-the-No.pdf \"Research\nLink\"). One reason behind this uncertainty is that digital transformation has\nnot just forced organizations to redesign their business models and processes,\nbut also their management practices. The use of next-gen technology in HR has\ndisrupted the [already-evolving\nfunction](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2017/digital-transformation-in-hr.html \"Research Link\"), giving rise to\nnew challenges and opportunities. To understand these shifts, it would help to\nretrace the role of HR and contextualize the change taking place in the last\ndecade. Here\u2019s a look at how new-age technology and tools have helped\ntransform the core functions of HR:\n\n### The shift to a purpose-based HR\n\nFor the longest time, the core function of HR tools and systems has been to\nmaintain a system of record. HR\u2019s role was only a transactional necessity\nbetween the employee and the employer.\n\nThe proliferation of next-gen tech in HR is helping organizations keep track\nof people\u2019s work, undertake objective performance assessment, measure\nengagement, and support employees in making their work-life easier. This shift\nfrom a process-based to a purpose-based HR has paved the way for organizations\nto manage their employees as people and not just resources.\n\n### Meeting the changing workforce expectations\n\nThe next discernible change in HR has been the realization of how vital it is\nto address people's challenges in a timely fashion. Whether its challenges\npertaining to working remotely or digitizing functional HR activities like\nrecruitment, engagement, and assessment \u2013 all of which have been strengthened\nby the inclusion of employee data, advanced tools and devices have helped\norganizations capture and analyze an employee data. Thus, quarterly, or\nyearly, appraisals have given way to continuous feedback, continuous learning\nand continuous rewards.\n\n### Increased focus on experience\n\nThe transition from process-based to purpose-based HR has been enabled by\nsystems and technologies that are designed around \u2018experiences.\u2019 This has\nresulted in HR systems and tools to become more intuitive, user-friendly, and\nadaptive. One of the biggest consequences of this has been the inclusion of\nmulti-disciplinary experts in the HR function, which, up until a decade ago,\nwould have been difficult to imagine. Today, leading organizations are hiring\nexperts in analytics, artificial intelligence, user interface/experience, and\ndesign thinking to improve workplace experience.\n\nTechnologies like robotics process automation, machine learning, natural\nlanguage processing are being leveraged to develop simple, and seamless HR\nsystems. Similarly, the increasing use of digital tools to measure health and\nwellness has also helped collaborate with mental health experts, fitness\ncoaches, and dieticians. This has made it possible for experts with diverse\nknowledge to build cohesive HR solutions that ensure maximum optimization and\nefficiency.\n\nHR leaders and professionals must work towards aligning the entire HR function\nto ensure that employees can perform to their potential. They need to leverage\nnew technologies to empower and engage employees with systems that can deliver\na smooth workplace experience for a diverse workforce. Finally, they need to\nembrace the fact that being digital does not mean randomly using new\ntechnology and tools, but systematically using them to optimize existing human\ncapital management practices. These changes will not only make the HR function\nmore effective but also redefine its business scope in the organization. While\nthe process involves several experts and stakeholders, HR leaders must lead\nthe process of building systems that are truly adaptive, enhance productivity,\nand are designed for every employee in the organization.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Manav Seth](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1452578431/authors/manav-\nseth.jpg)](/author/manav-seth)\n\n#### [Manav Seth](/author/manav-seth)\n\nManav Seth is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The role of UI and UX in boosting employee experience\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-engagement/the-role-of-ui-and-\nux-in-boosting-employee-experience-24802?page=2 \"Article: The role of UI and\nUX in boosting employee experience &ndash;

People\nAnalytics](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/s1prbpwb9em3mqxllrj8xa.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * HR should be a more intentional translator of workplace data\n  * Focus on performance-predicting metrics over general performance reviews\n  * Data analytics need specific, defined outcomes\n\nIt's the age of data -- and data analytics is revolutionizing HR.\n\nAccenture calculated that there is $3.1 trillion in U.S. revenue opportunity\nfor large publicly listed companies from new sources of digitally available\nworkplace data.\n\nBut is HR prepared to optimize this opportunity?\n\nHR has long been seen as the custodian of \"hard\" data, such as cost of\nemployment, cost of turnover, absenteeism, labor costs and the like. All of\nthis information is critical, but it's a lagging indicator of performance and\nproductivity. By the time the numbers are in, it's too late to change the\nstrategy.\n\nHR can be -- and should be -- a more intentional translator of leading-\nindicator workforce data. To do that, CHROs must drive core people analytics\nharder, particularly concerning strategic performance and talent management.\nFor strategic HR organizations, the days of data maintenance are over.\n\nCHROs must drive core people analytics harder, particularly concerning\nstrategic performance and talent management.\n\n### Fully Leverage Leading Indicators of Performance\n\nStrategic analysis requires leading indicators and the ability to curate,\nsynthesize and analyze that data. HR also requires the authority to enact real\norganizational changes as a result of their performance analysis. But to do\nany of that, HR needs very specific data.\n\nFor instance, [according to Gallup\nresearch](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-\nmanagement.aspx), only 29% of employees strongly agree that their performance\nreviews are fair and 26% strongly agree that they are accurate. Fewer yet say\nthey're managed in a way that [motivates them to do outstanding\nwork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231659/performance-measures-motivate-\nmadden-employees.aspx). Those granular details add up to organization-level\nperformance and growth issues.\n\nHR should know the percentages of each of those metrics in their\norganizations. Those data explain factors -- such as employee engagement,\ntalent performance, turnover drivers, etc. -- that predict performance,\nhelping leaders understand what can be changed while there is still a chance.\n\nBut there are a lot of ways HR can help leaders to truly leverage the power of\npredictive analytics and accelerate quality decision-making. The key, however,\nis to determine the fewest workforce and performance metrics that provide\nmaximum explanatory power over critical outcomes. In our experience, the\nfollowing steps are essential:\n\n>   1. Audit and organize existing data from multiple sources and years into a\n> single database (workforce, operational and business data).\n>\n>   2. Leverage advanced analytics to determine what metrics are the most\n> reliable, indicative and predictive of critical business outcomes (i.e.,\n> turnover, productivity, sales, profitability) and which have the highest\n> data quality.\n>\n>   3. Use the pared list of workforce metrics to monitor and forecast\n> business performance, inform changes to strategy, and prioritize\n> interventions and change initiatives. Focus these on answering fundamental\n> questions that will help the business drive value. For instance: _How\n> effectively can we predict the quality of talent intake for a specific role\n> based on applicant data? What factors increase the likelihood that top\n> talent will stay with the company and continue to perform?_\n>\n>\n\nLeaders value such strategic analysis, as it helps them make the right\ndecisions. Still, HR needs to get better at using such analytics to tell a\nstory about what drives long-term value for the company (aligned with their\nstrategic purpose) -- rather than narrow, short-term workforce enhancement\ninitiatives based on descriptive analysis alone.\n\n### Disrupt Talent Analytics\n\nConsider, for example, talent management discussions. In our experience, the\ntalent review is one area that has seen regular, consistent abuse. Most\ncompanies have long relied on the nine-box model that classifies talent into\ncategories such as top talent, consistent superstars or solid performers, and\nunderperformers.\n\nNothing wrong with that. But the quality and objectivity of the data are\nconcerning.\n\nTraditionally, a \"high-potential\" employee is rated as such to reflect a set\nof competencies. The employee's manager designates that label, but managers'\nevaluations are frequently riddled with bias. The whole evaluation process\ntakes a few months to complete. After that is an endless wait for executive\ninput and, finally, the creation of the individual development plan. In the\nmeantime, employees have moved on; the developmental input is late or not\nrelevant anymore.\n\nThe long, cumbersome traditional talent review process needs to be disrupted.\nThis starts with the assessment and analysis of more objective indicators of\npotential. But once an objective review has been completed, HR can move faster\nto translate the assessment insights into real development plans -- especially\nto help managers of top talent use those insights in their [coaching\nconversations](https://courses.gallup.com/workplace/five-conversations-that-\ndrive-performance.html) with every employee on a very regular basis. As it is,\nonly 23% of employees strongly agree that their [manager provides meaningful\nfeedback](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215390/gallup-performance-\nmanagement-ongoing-conversations.aspx) \\-- and making them wait months for\nbiased assessments is a questionable means of improving performance.\n\nThe long, cumbersome traditional talent review process needs to be disrupted.\nThis starts with the assessment and analysis of more objective indicators of\npotential.\n\nGoogle -- a company that bases all of its decisions on hard analytics --\noffers a great example of using data better. Early on, Google's people\nanalytics team came up with an algorithm to refine critical promotion\ndecisions for software engineers.\n\nThe algorithm was used to make an impressive 90% of all promotion decisions.\nBut the engineers wanted greater transparency, and an algorithm wasn't the\nanswer. So, Google discontinued the program. The company knew that people\nshould make people decisions, and analytics merely exists to arm decision-\nmakers with the most reliable insights. In essence, having the right data\nversus having enough data was a critical point to keep in mind.\n\n### Connect Data Analytics to Long-Term Goals\n\nHR's innovative use of predictive data analytics should have clearly defined\noutcomes, as all projects should. But to be maximally useful, those\ndeliverables need to be tied to specific customer, operational and business\noutcomes -- as well as to outcomes at the organizational level such as time to\nmarket, shorter cycle times, rapid product innovation or accelerated quality\nimprovement.\n\nAnd to be genuinely agile, HR must go beyond outcomes to measures of\ncontinuous quality improvement on leading indicators, such as customer and\nemployee engagement metrics and talent and development impact. These are the\nfactors that truly drive business performance.\n\nBacked by objective data and supported by managers in real time, HR could do\nwhat all the analysis in the world can't: lead to predictable, measurable,\nsuccessful outcomes.\n\nTo be blunt, HR has the potential to catalyze disruption into opportunity --\nbut it has to be able to translate people analytics into business decisions\nfirst.\n\n### **Turn the data you have into a competitive advantage.

This Morning](https://www.inc.com/newsletter), a daily\nnews digest curated for those passionate about entrepreneurship._\n\nYou've probably heard the term \"people analytics\" before. Still, if I were to\nask how your company uses them _right now_ , the odds are good that you'd say:\n\"We don't.\"\n\nThat's [according to a study](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/linkedin-just-\nrevealed-results-of-its-2020-global-talent-trends-report-there-are-some-big-\nsurprises.html) published Wednesday by LinkedIn, which surveyed 7,089 talent\nprofessionals and hiring managers last fall on a wide range of topics. The\nstudy spotlights people analytics as one of four major talent trends to watch\nin 2020--which is interesting because 55 percent of surveyed talent\nprofessionals also said they \"still need help putting basic people analytics\ninto practice.\"\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the term, here's a quick definition: People\nanalytics basically means using data to bolster your HR department's ability\nto consistently recruit, hire, and retain great employees. The LinkedIn survey\nnotes that many companies--68 percent of those surveyed--use data to measure\nemployee performance, which is a great starting point. But, it adds, a\ndistinct minority of companies currently use analytics to identify flight\nrisks within their ranks, reduce bias in hiring and promotions, predict a job\ncandidate's potential success in a role, and so on.\n\nTranslation: There's an opportunity here. Earlier this month, in a story about\nthe biggest changes coming to hiring and jobs in 2020, my colleague Brit Morse\nwrote about [how Salesforce employs people\nanalytics](https://www.inc.com/brit-morse/human-resources-trends-2020-best-of-\ninc.html). It's surprisingly unfancy: The company uses the same kinds of\nemployee surveys that might measure employee performance to help managers\ndetermine who is engaged, has great company-improving ideas, and makes a habit\nof helping co-workers. That same data also helps Salesforce identify employees\nwho are struggling under specific managers, which allows the company to solve\nworkplace disputes before they explode.\n\nIt's probably not an unfamiliar data-gathering strategy for a lot of companies\nand it requires no additional costs, yet Salesforce seems to yield a lot of\nreturn from it. The basic difference here is the ability to analyze the data\nyou get on your people. While the LinkedIn study reports that half of those\nsurveyed said their companies were good at collecting and maintaining some\nform of people analytics data, only 39 percent felt confident analyzing it.\nUsing the data to solve existing problems? Just 37 percent. And using it to\nproactively solve future problems? A mere 29 percent.\n\nIf you have the money to invest in this area, you can. A growing industry has\nemerged around HR data collection and analysis in recent years, featuring\ncompanies like Tableau, Looker, and Twine (which was [a 2019 _Inc._ Rising\nStars honoree](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/twine-human-resources-software-\ndata-metrics-evernote-30-under-30-2019.html)). Otherwise, your solution might\nbe as simple as tweaking your existing processes to learn something new about\nthose who work for you.\n\nYou almost certainly use data to inform your operational decisions on topics\nlike sales, budgeting, and funding. It could be time to apply the same concept\nto your people, too.\n\nPublished on: Jan 23, 2020\n\nMore from Inc.\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"}, {"item": "The top HR and human capital trends for 2020 and 2021 - Consultancy.eu", "link": "https://www.consultancy.eu/news/4021/the-top-hr-and-human-capital-trends-for-2020-and-2021", "guid": "CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmV1L25ld3MvNDAyMS90aGUtdG9wLWhyLWFuZC1odW1hbi1jYXBpdGFsLXRyZW5kcy1mb3ItMjAyMC1hbmQtMjAyMdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmV1L25ld3MvYW1wLzQwMjEvdGhlLXRvcC1oci1hbmQtaHVtYW4tY2FwaXRhbC10cmVuZHMtZm9yLTIwMjAtYW5kLTIwMjE", "pubdate": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.consultancy.eu/news/4021/the-top-hr-and-human-capital-trends-for-2020-and-2021\" target=\"_blank\">The top HR and human capital trends for 2020 and 2021</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Consultancy.eu</font>", "source": "Consultancy.eu", "body": "[Consultancy.org](https://www.consultancy.org)\n\n  * Americas\n  * Europe\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Asia\n  * Oceania\n  * |\n  * Select Country\n\n[Join the platform](/join-the-platform \"Join the platform\")\n\n[ ![](/img/Consultancy_eu_big_logo.png) ![](/img/Consultancy_icon_60x60.png)\n](https://www.consultancy.eu \"Consultancy.eu\")\n\n  * [News](/news \"News\")\n  * [Consulting Firms](/firms \"Consulting Firms\")\n  * [Projects](/projects \"Projects\")\n  * [Jobs](/jobs \"Jobs\")\n  * [Career](/career \"Career\")\n  * [Consulting Industry](/consulting-industry \"Consulting Industry\")\n  * [Partners](/partners \"Partners\")\n\nConsulting industry news\n\n    * [Consulting sector](/news/consulting/consulting-sector)\n    * [New firms](/news/consulting/new-firms)\n    * [Financial data](/news/consulting/financial-data)\n    * [Milestones](/news/consulting/milestones)\n    * [M&A; in consulting](/news/consulting/ma-in-consulting)\n    * [Rankings & Awards](/news/consulting/rankings-awards)\n    * [People](/news/consulting/people)\n\nIndustry\n\nSelect an industry from 40+ different sectors.\n\nService area\n\nSelect a service from 40+ different areas of expertise.\n\nConsulting firm\n\nView news per consulting firm.

across sixteen geographies has identified the four most important\nglobal HR and human capital trends for 2020 and 2021._  \n\nAccording to the research by [Mercer](/firms/mercer \"Mercer\"), the four top\ntrends have already increasingly been shaping the face of the human resources\nlandscape for a number of years, but these are now accelerating in importance\namid the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on economy and society. \"The trends\nare ramping up changes in the way organisations globally are working and will\ncontinue to work into the future,\" stated the report.\n\n## **ESG and Purpose**\n\nWith a new, more responsible mandate emerging, the challenge for business is\nto rethink what makes corporations successful. Although 85% of executives\nagree that the organisation's purpose should extend beyond shareholder\nprimacy, only 35% deliver on a multi-stakeholder model today.\n\nThe majority of the C-suite agrees more needs to be done: 68% of executives\nwant to accelerate progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG)\nmetrics in 2020, and 69% believe HR should update its success models to\nreflect the experience economy. However, with responsibility for many ESG\nmetrics and culture change outcomes sitting primarily with HR (71% of CHROs\nshoulder the responsibility for culture change, compared with between 16% and\n29% of other executives), more shared responsibility is required.\n\n![The top HR and human capital\ntrends](/illustrations/news/detail/2020-03-28-115806555-The-top-HR-and-human-\ncapital-trends.jpg)\n\nMuch of an organisation's success depends on employees trusting that their\ncompany is taking a holistic view of their careers, wealth and well-being. Yet\ncareer pipelines have tightened in recent years. As many as 72% of older\nworkers say they plan to work past retirement age and 55% of Gen X say\nlongevity in the workplace is limiting progression. Gen Z also want more\ntransparency on the effect of career choices and the long-term outlook.\n\nAn intriguing finding of the 2020 HR Trends report is that employees who know\nthe lifespan of their skills feel more positive about the future. Employees\nwhose companies are transparent about which jobs will change are more likely\nto be thriving (72% versus 56%).\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic impacts productivity, better management of older\nworkers and good financial advice for all generations will be part of creating\nshared value. More than three-quarters (78%) of employees want long-term\nfinancial planning initiatives. Meanwhile 75% of employees who feel in control\nof designing their retirement say they are thriving, compared with 29% who\nlack the control they desire.\n\nYet, with just 23% of companies providing financial education for employees\ntoday, there is a long way to go. Pandemic-driven disruption demands that\norganisations urgently rethink financial support and ensure that decisions\ninclude both economic and empathetic considerations (a balance that only 37%\nof employees say their company is currently well equipped to do).\n\n## **Building and adapting skills**\n\nWith 99% of organisations saying they want to embark on transformation in\n2020, and almost all reporting significant skills gaps, the C-suite regards\nreskilling as the top talent investment capable of driving business success.\nWorkforce capability and lack of future skills are seen as primary reasons why\ntransformations fail, and reskilling is one of the investments they hope to\nmaintain in a downturn. Just 28% identified cutting back on reskilling\ninitiatives as a tactic to mitigate economic softening.\n\nEmployees also see reskilling as an emerging part of the deal (rising in\nimportance as an attraction and a retention driver this year). And although\nmore than three-quarters of employees say they are ready to learn new skills,\ntwo in five say they lack the time to take advantage of reskilling. In this\nrespect the Covid-19 pandemic may offer the opportunity required to kick-start\nreskilling. Some business areas will have more time to spare, and firms can\ntake advantage by directing those employees toward online learning courses and\ncareer exploration.\n\nHowever, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in workforce learning and\nreskilling as part of their future of work strategy. Moreover, 40% of HR\nleaders do not know what skills their workforce possesses. This can be\nregarded as a worrying lack of insight, given executives' gut feeling that\nless than half (45%) of their workers are capable of adapting to the future of\nwork.\n\nWithout redesigning roles and career options for those at risk of\ndisplacement, HR cannot address firm-wide needs to fill new roles with\nreskilled internal talent. The concern is that without an integrated approach\nto strategic workforce planning (which takes account of how skills may change)\nand limited data on existing skills, companies may inadvertently lose valued\ntalent. Long-term planning would enable firms to imagine brighter futures for\ntheir employees and boost their competitiveness once economic conditions\nimprove.\n\n## **Data science**\n\nThe good news is that the workforce science discipline is gathering momentum.\nThe use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years, from 10%\nin 2016 to 39% today, and the use of metrics on pay inequities and total\nrewards usage has more than doubled.\n\nThat said, insights into workforce management could be adopted more widely.\nOnly 43% of organisations use metrics to identify employees likely to leave,\n18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance, and just 12% use\nanalytics to correct inequities and prevent them from recurring. Moreover, in\nthe current disruption are companies looking in the right places to ensure\nsustainability? Only 24% have data on who is at risk of burnout and only 15%\ncan determine whether it is better to buy/build/ borrow employees.\n\nThe next wave of maturity requires HR to lean in to structure analytics such\nthat it can answer key strategic questions, like: In a downturn, which\nstrategy offers the best chance of maintaining performance? Which departments\ncould deliver a similar level of output with more contingent staff? Where\nshould we locate talent hubs to take advantage of skilled talent pools?\n\nIn parallel, advances in machine learning continue to filter through\ndepartments, including HR. Although machines outperform humans at tasks\nrelated to scale and speed, humans still outpace machines in sense-checking\nand judgment Sixty-seven percent of HR leaders are confident they can ensure\nAI is not institutionalising bias. However, ethics codes about the collection,\napplication and implications of data analytics are still in their infancy.\n\nTalent assessment is an area where human intuition is needed alongside\npsychometrics to qualify findings. Today, only one in two employees have a\npositive assessment experience. This is just one example of data collection\nthat will attract more scrutiny as data-informed decision-making becomes\ncommon. Leading companies are on the front foot sharing data-driven insights\nwith employees to help them make health, wealth and career decisions: 38% of\norganisations today apply intelligent \"nudging\" technology to help employees\nmake better choices. Further, exploring relevant metrics and sharing them with\nemployees shows how the new climate of remote working affects productivity.\n\n## **Employee experience**\n\nDelivering on the employee experience is a top priority for HR in 2020. Fifty-\neight percent of organisations are redesigning their structures to become more\npeople-centric. Yet only 27% of the C-suite believe their investment in the\nemployee experience will yield a business return. Why? Because executives are\nyet to be convinced of the link between the employee experience and\nproductivity.\n\nAlmost half (48%) of executives rank employees' well-being as a top workforce\nconcern, but only 29% of HR leaders have a health and well-being strategy.\nFeeling depleted is a worrying trend (particularly for employees in Japan and\nthe UK), and two-thirds of employees globally feel at risk of burnout in the\nyear ahead. Burnout risk will only be exacerbated as employees now balance\nwork with social distancing, remote working, closures and quarantines.\n\nThe Mercer study shows that action is vital, given that energised employees\nare four times more likely to report a healthy, flexible and inclusive\nworkplace. Employees who are energised by their job are essential to\ntransformation agendas: Energised employees say they are more likely to stay,\nmore resilient and more ready to reskill. Energised employees work in cultures\nthat are empathetic, in environments they find enriching, and in work cultures\nthat are both efficient and embracing.\n\nSeamless interactions and better enablement of digital working in times of\nsocial distancing have a clear role to play, yet only two in five companies\nsay they are mostly or fully digital, the same proportion as in 2018. This\nwill remain a C-suite priority.\n\nFocusing on the desired interactions between HR and the business is key to\nunlocking energy and enhancing the employee experience. Delivering on this\naspiration requires HR to step out of its traditional functional silos.\nDespite the benefits associated with a more joined up approach, just 40% of HR\nleaders say they have an integrated people strategy today.\n\nThe good news is that 50% of HR respondents have moved away from traditional\nstructures to meet their businesses' escalating need for agility and 26% say\nthey have built a fluid team to respond to different business priorities.\nGrappling with stability and agility will be a key theme in 2020.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nAccording to Mercer's 2020 Global Talent Trends study, the talent landscape\nwill be disrupted in the coming years as jobs are replaced, new skills enter\nthe labour market and the demands of workers changes. As employers transform\nto tackle these matters, they should reconsider their company's purpose and\ntheir responsibilities to employees and employees' future earnings. And, they\nneed to do so while facing unforeseen challenges like the current coronavirus.\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=The top HR and human capital trends for 2020 and

latest issue of Relocate magazine \u2013 the must\nread for HR, global managers and relocation professionals.  \nClick on the cover to access the [digital ](/digital-issues)edition and order\nyour [printed](/relocate-global-shop) copy.**\n\n* * *\n\nThe [CIPD](https://www.cipd.co.uk/) (Chartered Institute of Personnel and\nDevelopment) is placing considerable emphasis on people analytics data and how\nit can help to advance evidence-based decision-making by HR professionals\nwithin organisations. At its recent people analytics conference \u2018Are you\nprepared for the future of people data?\u2019, the HR professional body drew\nattention to building a data-driven culture and its inherent benefits,\nillustrated with numerous case study examples from major businesses and public\nsector bodies. The conference opened with a call from the CIPD for HR to take\nup the challenge to use data to help build capability and skills. For those\nbeginning their careers in HR, the CIPD emphasised the potential career\nopportunities that a strong focus on people analytics can bring. People\nanalytics is predicted to become a standalone function within HR, with various\nroles available within data analysis and communication leading on to high-\nlevel positions such as head of people analytics. Data-driven organisations\nwill offer clearly defined HR career pathways. Notwithstanding this, the first\nchallenge identified at the conference was how to change organisational\nculture to become data-driven.\n\n## Driving forward a people analytics data culture\n\nTo achieve a data-driven approach to decision-making, the value of people\nanalytics data must first be recognised, including how added business value\ncan be derived from using data, scaled up for implementation across the\nbusiness and embedded within organisational cultural values. To establish new\nmind-sets and behaviours, old habits need to be broken to prevent people from\nusing previous decision-making processes. The first step to achieve this is to\ndevelop awareness by being explicit about the value of data and communicating\nclearly how it can be used. Continuous feedback is needed to ensure that\npeople keep on using data in their decisions. Facilitating the use of data in\ndecision-making will require guidance on the decisions needed, development of\ndata literacy and the input of fresh capability to prepare data. HR itself\nneeds to become data literate if it is to assist others in this process.\nChanging the environment so that systems and workspaces encourage data sharing\nand discussion will help to embed the new data-driven culture. In addition,\nkey performance indicators linked to data usage can help to reinforce the\nculture. People analytics data can enhance business success in a variety of\nways, for example, in driving forward improved knowledge sharing, workforce\nplanning and improving employee engagement.\n\n## Learning and development\n\nThe development of a smart data-driven learning and development platform can\nassist businesses to improve knowledge capability. By recording how, when and\nwhere learners access learning materials \u2013 and the information they find most\nuseful \u2013 learning and development interventions can be better tailored to the\nneeds of the business and the users of the learning materials who are required\nto deliver business objectives. Business questions linked to organisational\nstrategy can be identified through data capture and then these questions\naddressed via the development and posting online of the most relevant sources\nof knowledge. Analysis of usage data can show which sources of knowledge are\nmost used/helpful. The curation of learning and development materials can then\nbe tailored to ensure the most appropriate catalogue of relevant topics are\neasily accessible to staff.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nA further example concerns the use of people analytics data to make meaningful\nchange around diversity and inclusion. Understanding and appropriate\nstorytelling of data can be used to make links between numbers (such as\nheadcounts) and projecting forward as to what a workforce profile will look\nlike in the future. By analysing the data evidence of a current workforce\nprofile and recruitment and selection metrics, strategies can be devised and\nenacted to hire, promote and retain a more diverse workforce. In this way,\npeople analytics dashboard data is brought to life with strategic actions\ntaken to create a dynamic workforce profile. Hence, the connection of data to\nbusiness outcomes helps build momentum for change.\n\n* * *\n\n## [Download our free Global Mobility Toolkit factsheets](/articles/global-\nmobility-toolkit-download-our-preview-factsheet) \\- on diversity, group moves,\ntalent and career management, and many more topics\n\n* * *\n\n## Workforce planning\n\nData analytics can also be used for workforce planning to ensure the right\npeople with the right skills are in place at the right time and cost. Using\npeople data analytics can assist in identifying and recording the skills\ncurrently held in a business and matching them to skills required in future\noperations. Data must be accurate and high quality to ensure that in\nredeployment exercises, people are treated objectively and fairly. Using data\nanalytics to identify people and their appropriate future job roles is, of\ncourse, unlikely to lead to a 100 per cent match between current skills and\nfuture capability requirements. Nonetheless, it can help to identify the main\nskills available and slot people into potential roles. It can also identify\ngaps and training needs. A factor that also needs to be considered is location\n\u2013 a people-job match may involve relocation and that may not always be the\nbest solution for the individual or the business.\n\n* * *\n\n **Related articles**\n\n  * [HR sidelined in AI investment decisions and implementation](/news/cipd-hr-sidelined-in-ai-investment-decisions-and-implementation-0419-rholmes)\n  * [Why digital transformation creates a retention problem for certain types of employees](/articles/hr-technology-why-digital-transformation-creates-a-retention-problem-for-certain-types-of-employees-0819)\n  * [UK scheme to retrain workers ousted by AI](/news/business-training-technology-uk-scheme-to-retrain-workers-ousted-by-ai-dsapsted-0719)\n\n* * *\n\n## Employee experience\n\nOrganisations wishing to measure and improve their employee experience can\nalso make use of people analytics data to aid this process. Data from\nengagement surveys and exit interviews, for example, can be used to assess\nemployee values and how these align with organisational values and priorities.\nIf an organisation plans a culture-change journey, data analytics can be used\nto map out where the current priorities lie and how these will need to change\nto reach the desired endpoint.\n\n* * *\n\n### Keep up-to-date on HR news and features in our dedicated [HR](/hr-section)\nsection.\n\n* * *\n\nLine managers are key to cultural change and so they need to understand the\ndata and the steps needed to move to a new cultural environment. Regular pulse\nchecks on how employees feel about the change process can generate data, which\ncan be used to consolidate wins as the journey progresses and address problems\nthrough change champions.\n\n## Top tips\n\nOne of the key messages of the conference was not to rely on \u2018shiny\u2019 charts\nand graphs. Data comes to life through storytelling with the creation of a\nnarrative around the aims and objectives of organisational change. Data\nchampions \u2013 people who understand data and enjoy communicating its messages \u2013\nat all levels in organisations are crucial to embedding a data-driven culture.\nThe importance of starting small and growing a people analytics culture was\nalso stressed. To assist HR practitioners in their data journey, ISO standards\nare being developed ([ISO 30414](https://www.iso.org/standard/69338.html))\nwith principles being articulated that capture emerging excellent practice in\ncontext. The new book [_Human Capital Management Standards: A Complete\nGuide_](https://www.koganpage.com/product/human-capital-management-\nstandards-9780749484347) by CIPD staff Wilson Wong, Valerie Anderson and\nHeather Bond (published in 2019 by Kogan Page) should also prove\nhelpful.Finally, the CIPD reminds us that it is always important to maintain a\nresponsible and ethical approach to data collection, analysis and\ndissemination. Working within legislative guidelines, the message is to only\ncollect data that you need and be sure to think about its limitations when\nusing it to drive change forward.\n\n## [Read more articles in the Winter Issue](/articles/relocate-magazine-\nwi19-winter-2019-issue-out-now) of Relocate Magazine.\n\n**[Subscribe to Relocate\nExtra](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/magazineregistration?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=reg),\nour monthly newsletter, to get all the latest international assignments and\nglobal mobility news.** **Relocate\u2019s new[Global Mobility\nToolkit](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-mobility-toolkit-download-\nour-preview-factsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtt)\nprovides free information, practical advice and support for HR, global\nmobility managers and global teams operating overseas.** **[![Global Mobility\nToolkit download factsheets resource centre](/media/images/RELO-GM-\nTOOLKIT-432x172-v2_12993_t5.jpg)](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-\nmobility-toolkit-download-our-preview-\nfactsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtbutton)**\n**[Access](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/directory?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=dir)\nhundreds of global services and suppliers in our Online Directory** **[![Click\nto get to the Relocate Global Online\nDirectory](/media/images/ScreenShot2016-09-20at171042_9694_t5.png)](/directory)**\n\n\u00a92020 Re:locate magazine, published by Profile Locations, Spray Hill, Hastings\nRoad, Lamberhurst, Kent TN3 8JB.

Stories_person-holding-white-printer-\npaper](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/people_analytics_success_stories_person-\nholding-white-printer-paper.jpg)\n\nAs human resources continues to move into the future and professionals take a\nserious look at their people, one thing is certain:  the need for high\nperforming talent is the greatest it's ever been in the history of business.\nIt's for that reason leveraging data in human resources is paramount to\nsuccess.  Growth is linked to the data function and its existence across all\ndimensions of HR from talent acquisition to retention.\n\n# People Analytics\n\n## The Stats\n\nAccording to Deloitte's Human Capital Trends report, 71% of companies see\npeople analytics as a high priority, but only 9% believe they have a good\nunderstanding of which talent dimension drives performance in their companies.\n\nWhy is data so important?\n\n\"Organizations today realized that good HR practices are no longer enough as\nwe need a more data driven approach which can lead to evidence based HR, thus\nreducing human bias and subjectivity. When HR is able to make impact through\nanalytics, they take on a more strategic role and are able to help their\norganizations gain a competitive advantage through clever use of data,\" Jaclyn\nLee said.  She's the Chief Human Resources Officer for the Singapore\nUniversity of Technology and Design.\n\n> RELATED:  [People Analytics - Where Do We\n> Begin?](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/people-\n> analytics-where-do-we-begin)\n\n\"Analytics,\" she continued, \"also have a huge potential to increase return on\ninvestment when the numbers are tied to business outcomes and when predictions\npoint to a range of possibilities that companies can plan for.\"\n\nSo, how are companies driving growth with [people\nanalytics](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/data-\nthat-generates-discovery)?\n\n### Talent Acquisition\n\nLinkedIn[0](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/recruiting-\nstrategy/2016/how-building-out-a-talent-analytics-function-saved-linkedin-\nrecruiting-considerable-time-and-\nmoney?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=946764&utm_campaign=0&_ga=2.87586776.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130)\nprovides a fair share of resources to the HR professional, but it is also\ncompany in need of solutions.  The social media platform for professionals has\nbeen faced with a great demand for its services, but not enough manpower to\nprovide those services.  At one point, the company was growing at 40% every\nyear and the talent acquisition team was struggling to accurately forecast the\nnumber of hires needed to address the demands on the company.\n\nThat's when they employed people analytics as part of their solution.  In just\none year, LinkedIn was able to predict hires within 5% of its actual hires.\nThat translated into money saved for the social media giant.  Also in that\nfirst year, the company saved 15% of its recruiting budget.\n\n### ISS and Employee Engagement\n\nISS[1](http://www.publications.issworld.com/ISS/External/issworld/White_papers/LinkingEmployeeandCustomerEngagement/?_ga=2.50927721.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130)\nhas more than 510,000 employees across the globe, and the facilities company\nhad a problem.  Leaders wanted to know if it was possible to improve the\ncustomer experience and increase profits through higher employee engagement.\nTo figure out a solution, ISS used people analytics to:\n\n  1. Analyze the link strength between employee engagement, customer satisfaction and profitability\n  2. Analyze data to identify HR processes that would have the biggest impact on improving employee engagement and customer experience, focusing on motivation, service quality, knowledge and responsiveness of service staff as key drivers.\n\nIn the process, ISS also found a strong link between high customer Net\nPromoter scores and contract profitability.\n\n> WEBINAR:  [Data for Dummies - How to Apply Data to\n> Learning](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/webinars/data-\n> for-dummies-how-to-apply-data-to-learning)\n\nOnce the company had its findings, it changed its training programs for\nsupervisors and employees as well as onboarding programs.\n\n### Retention\n\nOne of the most common problems solved via the use of people analytics is\nattrition.  Why?  It's relatively easy to create a business case and\ndemonstrate ROI.\n\nA solid example is provided by IBM[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-\nanalytics-interviews-1-anshul-sheopuri-ibm-david-green/?trk=mp-author-\ncard&_ga=2.86078680.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130).  The tech\ncompany employs a program called Proactive Retention.  Through use of\nanalytics, the company is able to predict which employees are likely to leave.\nIt is also able to pinpoint the best way to retain employees.  The program\nitself has helped the company save more than $270 million dollars since its\ninceptions.\n\nAnother example would be\nNielsen[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3S1bUhK3Fo&_ga=2.57695082.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130).\nWith the use of people analytics, the company has been able to calculate that\na single percentage point of attrition represents $5 million lost by the\ncompany.  So, how did they mitigate that significant loss of money?  The\nanswer is lateral moves.  The company looked at employees who had made lateral\nmoves versus those that remained in the same position for a long period of\ntime.  The data indicated those that made lateral moves were 48% more likely\nto remain with the company than those who had made no moves.\n\nAs a result, the company put the focus on lateral moves and gained buy-in from\nthe CEO.  Before doing so, only about 4% of employees had made lateral moves\nat the company.  Following that up, Nielsen created a program called Ready to\nRotate.  It empowers employees to self-advocate their desires to take on new\nchallenges within the company.  Within the first six months, the company saw a\n160% increase in traffic to the Ready to Rotate website.  The net result:\nthey saw the voluntary attrition rate for Q1 decrease by nearly half for the\nsame timeframe for the previous year.\n\n### Performance\n\nData and the analysis around it can be used for more than finding problems and\npreventing them.  It can also be used to help encourage productivity and\neffectiveness at the employee and team levels.  We're talking about people\ncentric analytics now.\n\nA great example of this is technology company Cisco.\n\nAt one point in time, Cisco conducted annual employee engagement surveys.\nSome 73,000 employees respond.  And it took time to analyze all of that data,\nshare it and then implement action plans based on the findings.  In recent\nyears, the company decided to shift its focus from the company altogether down\nto the team level.  This would allow them to get more useful feedback that\ncould be turned into action almost immediately.\n\nCisco also conducts pulse surveys.  The HR team then analyzes this data to\nmeasure team performance and leader interactions with their teams.  This\nfrequent analytical review provides leaders with data that links to key\nperformance indicators, leading to paths of improved performance.\n\nRoxanne Bisby Davis is the director of team analytics and research.\n\n\"We're not looking at it from the perspective of 'Who's performing badly?'\nRather, we're looking at who's great to see what they're doing and how they're\ndoing it, whether it's team members or leaders. By highlighting 'goodness,' it\ngives the teams opportunities to say, 'I really like that approach. Let's try\nit.'\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPeople analytics is not a substitute for strategy or critical thinking.  It\nis, however, another tool in the HR professional's tool box.  With the right\nmeasurements in place, companies can use data to improve and grow the business\non every level from talent acquisition to performance.\n\n> NEXT:  [Finding the Bridge

But, how do employers and HR staff ethically secure\nanalytics to make informed business decisions without invading the privacy of\ntheir employees, asks Andy Hames, Senior Vice President of Operations at\nPeople First.**_\n\nIt is no secret that data is valuable, leading to opportunities of discovery,\ninsight and informed decision-making. Data collection has become a dynamic\nasset in the working world especially, where people analytics is becoming an\nincreasingly important business strategy. In fact, according to a [recent\nDeloitte\nsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/human-\ncapital/deloitte-uk-human-capital-trends-2018.pdf), 85% of HR and business\nleaders considered people analytics to be an important or very important part\nof attracting and retaining staff, building a strong reputation and\ncultivating loyalty amongst customers.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPeople analytics refers to the method of collecting and analyzing information\nfrom employees that can help managers, HR staff and executives make better\ndecisions about business and workplace topics such as recruitment, talent\nmanagement, and workforce optimization. Before advancements in technology,\ncollecting insightful employee data was difficult. The end results were often\nstatistics rather than insights, limiting organizations\u2019 ability to understand\nand glean insights from the gathered information.\n\nNow, companies can obtain large amounts of data about their employees.\nHowever, this data collection can have its downfalls. The more information\nthat employers collect, the more questions are raised around the ethics of\ntracking employee behavior and security risks. To combat this, employers and\nHR teams must develop best practices for ethically collecting data to reap its\nbenefits in a positive way.\n\n## **Providing Insights**\n\nUntil recently, employers lacked the ability to dive deep into the information\ncollected from employees. Because of this, information \u2013 collected from\nsurveys, questionnaires and the like \u2013 was taken at face value, rather than\nanalyzed on a more granular level.\n\nNow, employers have the tools to efficiently dig deeper into employee data,\ndiscovering the trends and patterns that drive behaviors and outcomes.\nExamples of this include identifying which employees are at risk of leaving\ntheir position, which are ready for career progression and which are more\nlikely to fall victim to phishing campaigns.\n\nThis information allows the company to make better informed HR decisions,\nimproving productivity and employee engagement \u2013 two of the most critical\nissues facing employers today. With access to pragmatic people analytics,\ncompanies have a significant competitive advantage over organizations that\ndon\u2019t, with the ability to see what their employees may be lacking or looking\nfor without asking directly.\n\n## **Big Data or Big Brother?**\n\nThe promise of competitive advantage has led to an explosion in the amount of\nemployee data collected by businesses. But the appetite for data can be risky\nand raises ethical questions about how far companies should go to find\ninsights on employee behavior.\n\nFor example, in 2016, [employees at _The Daily\nTelegraph_](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/11/daily-telegraph-to-\nwithdraw-devices-monitoring-time-at-desk-after-criticism) were welcomed to\nwork with individual sensors at each of their desks to measure how much time\nwas spent at each one.\n\nThe publication told employees that the sensors were to collect environmental\nsustainability data, which could be analyzed to determine if office space was\nbeing used appropriately. The data could help the company decide if it should\nchange the size of its offices. _The Daily Telegraph_ staff was so outraged by\nthe sensors that they were removed by the end of the day.\n\nWhile collecting employee data is helpful, companies need to avoid taking it\ntoo far. Employees should not be coerced into certain behaviors through fear\nand wide-scale surveillance, like measuring how often an employee is sitting\nat their desk.\n\nRegardless of whether employers have good intentions about their methods of\ndata collection, respecting employee boundaries and protecting employees\u2019\nprivate information remains a priority. If not, businesses risk losing the\ntrust of their employees.\n\n**Learn More:[Does Your Organization Have Its Own People Analytics Team\nYet?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/does-your-\norganization-have-its-own-people-analytics-team-yet/)**\n\n## **Who is Making the Decisions?**\n\nWhile people analytics can provide unparalleled insights for organizations and\nHR staff, decisions should not be made based on data alone. No matter how\nsophisticated algorithms may be, they can\u2019t replace human intuition when it\ncomes to making the right, moral decision.\n\nOne example of the importance of human involvement in HR is in the recruitment\nprocess. While application testing tools and other algorithms can quickly\nanalyze resumes and job applications to filter and create a shortlist of job\ncandidates based on reported skills and experience, they are unable to\nquantify individual human characteristics and qualities as well as the\npotential for growth.\n\nRecruitment and many company decisions should always remain a human process.\nThe role of data analytics should be to assist and educate human decision-\nmaking processes \u2013 not replace them.\n\n## **Pragmatic People Analytics**\n\nIn the frenzy of data collection, some organizations lose sight of what they\nare trying to achieve in the first place. Collecting too much data and\nmeasuring everything just because a company can is often where employees feel\nintruded upon. People analytics should not be used to monitor employees\u2019 every\nmove, but as a way to improve the employee experience and continue to make the\nbusiness profitable. By being transparent about the information that they\u2019re\ntracking, companies will continue to retain the trust of their employees. With\ntrust, employees may be more willing to participate in data collection. To be\nsuccessful, people analytics should be a team effort from both the employee\nand the employer or HR team.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Address Internal Skills Gaps Through Talent Management to\nImprove Business\nOutcomes](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/how-to-address-internal-skills-gaps-through-talent-management-to-improve-\nbusiness-outcomes/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Ethically+Secure+People+Analytics\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Ethically+Secure+People+Analytics&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Ethically Secure People\nAnalytics&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

There\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about the\nvirus, but we have some idea of how to curtail its spread. That\u2019s why the most\nessential step for HR leaders today is to empower employees in times of crisis\nand create robust business continuity plans. **_\n\nWhile medical experts and WHO are sharing timely updates on public health best\npractices, we spoke to 11 industry leaders who share tips on [how HR can\ncommunicate with employees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\ncompliance/coronavirus-hr-communication/) during a pandemic.\n\nHere\u2019s what companies, managers, and CHROs can do to make sense of and lead\nemployees through an uncertain situation:\n\n## **1\\. Build Day-to-Day Habits Around Good Hygiene and Limit Travel**\n\n[**Jennifer Dennard**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-dennard-822b0616/)\n**, COO, and co-founder,**[ **Range**](http://www.range.co)\n\n\u201cAs HR leaders, we play a critical role in business continuity helping teams\nunderstand risks, implementing practices to reduce them, and ensuring\noperations can continue as seamlessly as possible. For the coronavirus, we\u2019ve\nworked to define policies, resources, and sound practices, and we\u2019ve\ncommunicated them, with transparent, regular updates from leadership. These\npractices take practice, so we\u2019ve been building day-to-day habits around good\nhygiene, limiting travel, now. Because our product helps remote teams stay in\nsync and strengthen connections, we all know how to work from home because we\ndo it at least one day a week. Consider providing specific guidance for how\nteams and leaders can operate effectively when working remotely. Create a\ndocument detailing how teams should adjust their operations and try having\neveryone work remotely one day a week to develop the operating model. Build\nthe practice now to avoid painful fire drills later.\u201d\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\"Frequent communication and simple guidance to help employees protect\nthemselves: Reminders on how to conduct oneself when sneezing or coughing:\nbest in a tissue and then discarding or into an elbow. NOT coughing or\nsneezing in hand as employees tend to forget to wash hands and then touch\ndoorknobs, copiers, etc., potentially infecting others. Washrooms stocked with\nhand sanitizers, paper towels, and soap.\u201d\n\n## **2\\. Leverage Remote Work to Continue Business as Usual**\n\n[**Alex Konanykhin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konanykhin/) **, CEO,**[\n**TransparentBusiness**](http://TransparentBusiness.com)\n\n\"HR has to be prepared to assure the smooth transition of the workforce to the\nwork-from-home scenario, should the pandemic make a daily commute to usual\nworkplaces impossible or unadvisable.\n\n\u201cMillions of people in China are banned from commuting to work. Remote work\nthere is no longer a matter of convenience or economic efficiency; it\u2019s\nliterally a matter of life and death. Unnecessary commute and congregating in\noffice buildings increase the rate of spread of the decease. However, managing\nremote workers blindly is notoriously inefficient, so HR must train their\nworkforce to use transparency solutions, which have become an essential\nelement of emergency preparedness and continuity of business.\u201d\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n**\u201cLeverage working from home:** Unlike many businesses, tech companies can\noperate using remote employees, so this is an excellent time to draw on this\ncapability. Ensure all employees are equipped to work from home and have met\nthe correct safety criteria to do so. This will show employees you support\nthem in their concerns about public transport travel and the closure of school\nand daycares and allows those who have been exposed to the virus, but aren\u2019t\nunwell, to work while in self-quarantine.\u201d\n\n**Learn more:**[ **6 Essential Remote Work Tools HR Needs to Deploy for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/6-essential-\nremote-work-tools-hr-needs-to-deploy-for-2020/)\n\n**[Courtney Bigony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtneybigony/), director of\npeople science, [15Five](http://15five.com)**\n\n\u201cIt's HR's responsibility to leverage flexible work plans and not only allow\nbut encourage employees who may feel sick to work from home and take time off\nwithout retaliation or punishment. If you don't already have a flexible work\nfrom home policy, now is the time to create one. It's HR's responsibility to\nmake it as easy as possible for employees to stay home at the early signs of\nsickness without fear. In short, put in place structures that make it easy for\npeople to do the right thing. If you have these structures in place, then when\nsomething like Coronavirus hits, then moving remote shouldn\u2019t affect business\nas usual.\u201d\n\n[**Ben Christensen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmchrist/) **, head of\npeople and talent,**[ **Handshake**](http://www.joinhandshake.com)\n\n\u201c1) If at all feasible, ask your employees to work from home. Social\ndistancing being put in place as early as possible can be key for helping slow\ndown the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201c2) Make sure your managers are set up for success in managing teams remotely,\nand you have a support system to make sure you\u2019re checking in on employees to\nmake sure they\u2019re safe and healthy. This is a quick guide we made for our\nmanagers when we made the choice to move to WFH and a guide we made for\nindividuals on expectations and best practices when working from home.\n\n\u201c3) There\u2019s a lot of information, uncertainty, and confusion. HR can play a\nkey role in helping employees make sense of all the information, and what this\nmeans for them and their family, leading to a happier, more comfortable, and\nsafe team. We are sending daily updates to our team letting them know about\nany changes to our policies or any other noteworthy news they may want to be\naware of.\n\n\u201c4) Take a look at what other companies are doing and build off the great work\nthat others have done. You don\u2019t need to figure it all out on your own.\u201d\n\n## **3\\. Reassess If Work Done by Each Team Can Be Paused, Re-located, or\nContinued**\n\n[**Ian Cook**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/) **, VP of people\nsolutions,**[ **Visier**](https://www.visier.com)\n\n\"HR's focus is on people. Pandemics and disasters massively affect people \u2013 HR\nis central to the planning and handling of these types of events. HR must\nbalance the needs of people with the need to keep business operations running.\n\n**\u201cTask 1** is to identify where people are and how likely they are to be\nexposed to and/ or impacted by the event.\n\n**\u201cTask 2** is to identify the work that is being done by this group and\ndetermine if it can be paused, re-located or continued with different\nenvironmental controls in place.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of our foodservice clients has already re-organized their\nshift structure and allocation of employees to reduce the risks to their\npeople.\n\n**\u201cTask 3** is to set, communicate and manage policy and work expectations for\nthe broader employee base.

Model an Approach to Problem Solving**\n\n[**Maggie Craddock**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiecraddock/) **,\nfounder, and president,**[ **Workplace\nRelationships**](http://workplacerelationships.com/)\n\n\u201cThis is the time to proactively address, at a human level, the challenges\nemployees may be battling internally as they strive to take effective actions\nexternally. Validating the needs of others protects resources that may be\ntough to quantify but priceless to your firm: loyalty, motivation, and\ncourage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also vital for employees at all levels to make sure that the messages\nthey are conveying and the actions they are taking are aligned as this crisis\nunfolds. Whenever we proffer a strategic plan, it\u2019s imperative to be able to\nexecute this in a manner that models an approach to problem-solving that\nsupports the firm\u2019s culture.\"\n\n## **5.** **Communication Must be Swift, Clear, and Supportive**\n\n[**Henry Albrecht**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryalbrecht/) **, CEO, and\nfounder,**[ **Limeade**](https://www.limeade.com)\n\n\"Now is the time your people need you the most. Your communication and the\nactions you take must be swift, clear and supportive. Here are three things\nemployers can do right now to protect their workforce:\n\n**\u201cDynamic Communication:** Email is not useful in situations like this as not\nevery employee has access, and email does not open opportunities for two-way\ncommunication for all. Ensure your company has a bidirectional engagement\nsolution to communicate proactively and to help you react to feedback.\nAdminister small surveys frequently to gauge how your employees are feeling\nand identify shifts in attitude, so you can adjust accordingly.\n\n**\u201cShow Care:** Your employees should hear from you often, feel supported and\ncared for, and the overarching message must be crystal clear: stay home if you\nare sick; know the travel policies; employees have a right to protect\nthemselves and their teams from spreading illnesses.\n\n**\u201cAddress Policies:** Develop corporate policies to proactively address the\nspread of viruses. Your workforce must know what the company is doing, how\nyou\u2019re doing it, and when, in order to feel confident that any scenario has\nbeen accounted for, which will increase feelings of safety.\"\n\n[**Kandi Gongora**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kandigongora/) **, VP people,\nand organizational excellence,**[ **Goodway\nGroup**](https://www.goodwaygroup.com)  \n  \n\"You must communicate that you are monitoring the situation while also\neducating employees on how to protect themselves at home and at work. If you\ndon\u2019t allow remote work, this is the best time to test and work out any issues\nbefore the virus spreads. It isn\u2019t easy and there will be challenges. You will\nneed to monitor its effectiveness and the overall wellbeing of employees. This\nrequires planning and thoughtfulness, but if everyone keeps an open mind you\ncan keep employees safe and productive and come away with learnings on how to\ncontinue to provide flexible working environments.\"\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n\"HR\u2019s role is like that of any other business leader: understand the business\nimpact in all the regions you operate in; and communicate, educate and put the\ncorrect protective measures in place. HR leaders should understand the supply\nchain: Where are all your employees located and how are they affected? Tech is\nknown to outsource certain parts of their software development, so it\u2019s\nimportant to understand how those countries are handling the virus.\n\n**\u201cCreate safe and open dialogue:** If employees feel they may be vilified for\nbringing the virus into the office, they are unlikely to disclose they are\nunwell or have been exposed. Communicate common myths about the virus and\nexplain when and how they should notify their workplace. Reinforce that there\nwill be no repercussions for coming forward and their privacy will be treated\nwith the upmost respect. It is also critical to train front line managers on\nthe company\u2019s approach and what questions to ask their team.\n\n**\u201cHave a plan in the event of an office outbreak:** Consider how you will\ncommunicate the outbreak, including details like when employees will need to\nuse PTO and when to work from home. Be clear on strategic actions like whether\nyou\u2019ll separate the executive team and whether you can outsource area of work\nif a team that is key to the business becomes unwell.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Low-Cost, High-Impact Internal Communication Tools for\nSmall Businesses**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/3-lowcost-highimpact-internal-communication-tools-for-small-\nbusinesses/)\n\n## **6.** **Make it Easy for Employees to Ask Questions via an Open-Door\nPolicy**\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\u201cCreate a website or webpage on corporate website with FAQs that is updated\nabout the coronavirus or any other crisis employees are facing or worried\nabout. Frequent updates are key.\n\n\u201cAllowing employees to stay at home and/or work from home when they are not\ncomfortable at work or feeling ill. Make it easy to ask.\n\n\u201cRemember that uncertainty and fear are productivity killers, so have an open-\ndoor policy and make it easy for employees to ask questions that cannot be\nanswered on the FAQ webpage. The more forthcoming HR departments are with\ninformation, support in helping employees practice hygiene and safety, and the\nmore they can create an environment of transparency, the more employees will\nbe able to focus on the job during the chaos.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HR\u2019s Critical Role in Emergency\nCommunications**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/hrs-critical-role-in-emergency-communications/)\n\n## **7.** **CHROs Must Provide Meaningful Input for Business Continuity\nPlanning**\n\n[**Umesh\nRamakrishnan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umeshceokingsleygatepartners/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Kingsley Gate Partners**](http://www.kingsleygate.com)\n\n\u201cIn a health-based crisis, like the coronavirus pandemic, HR plays a\nsignificant role both in risk mitigation and operational control. As the world\nknows now, the most vulnerable populations are ones that have underlying\nconditions \u2013 conditions that are protected from disclosure due to privacy\nlaws. The only ones with access to that information are HR executives. They\nshould use this to direct leadership teams with resource allocation, location\ndecisions, and sick leave policy adjustments. In addition, they should lean\ninto modifying compensation structures temporarily to protect their employees\nin the long term. CEOs should depend on their CHROs to provide meaningful\ninput into business continuity planning and risk mitigation. They should also\nset up a communication channel with remote employees that have not had\nexperience working in such a manner to ensure that morale is kept up during\nthis trying time. Now, more than ever, HR matters.\u201d\n\n_Found these tips on business continuity planning during coronavirus pandemic\nuseful?

[Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### _Nadya Oenara asks_ Chutima Sribumrungsart _, Deputy Managing Director \u2013\nHuman Resources, Microsoft (Thailand) all we need to know about leaders\nrequiring to be open to learning, listening to new ideas, accepting risk,\nhaving courage to share failures, and more._\n\n### Q What is the mindset that leaders require in order to actually succeed in\na digital world? And what\u2019s HR role here?\n\nThe success DNA in a digital world consists of speed, agility and\nintelligence. These three are critical for all members in the organisation and\nrequire leaders to exhibit attributes that set the tone from the top, and\nmindsets that support real change.\n\nA growth mindset has become a key characteristic of the digital era. Leaders\nare required to be open to learning, listen to new idea, accept risks, have\ncourage to share failures, give others the opportunity to try new things, and\nhave high empathy towards their teams.\n\nWith the expectation for leaders to transform their mindsets, HR has the\nopportunity to support leaders in identifying the required behaviours, shaping\nand developing these new behaviours, provide coaching, sharing feedback, and\nbe a bouncing board for leader.\n\nNot only in supporting leaders, HR also has a role to play in acting as the\norchestrator in the organisation to connect teams together, ensuring that\nchange happen across the board and aligns with company strategies.\n\n### Q How strongly do you find organisations tailoring their HR policies and\nsystems to localised needs?\n\nBased on my experiences and observation, I see HR policies being gradually\nmodernised in response to the changes in business expectations, employee\nprofile and value proposition.\n\nThe speed of change depends on each industry. I found multinational or\ninternational companies taking a more structural approach and most likely\ncustomising their policies to local requirements, both from a statutory as\nwell as cultural context.\n\nWhat really makes this effort successful is when the organisation has a clear\nvision and strategies for its organisation & people management function, which\nwill translate into the right policies that align to support the business.\n\n> ##### Especially in tough situations, challenges provide me a chance to\n> learn, experiment and develop new solutions to help the organisation.\n\n### Q What is the biggest motivation that keeps you going when things get\ntough in your role?\n\nMy personal principle is 'everything is possible', and my positive energy is\ndriven from seeing positive outcomes in helping others succeed. Therefore when\nI face challenges, I see them as opportunities. Especially in tough\nsituations, these provide me a chance to learn, experiment and develop new\nsolutions to help the organisation.\n\nMost importantly, I don\u2019t take such things personally. I focus more on the\ncontext of the challenge and work things out from there. I make sure to\nreflect on the learning and appreciate the impact of contribution, and of\ncourse, take out time to enjoy and smell the roses. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n### Q In your experience, what is the biggest talent challenge Thailand is\nfacing, and how are you tackling that?\n\nDigital transformation, skill economy, changing lifestyles, expectations from\norganisations, and shortage of digital talents are all challenges in the area\nof talent. These lead to business challenges in terms of ensuring continuity,\nability to grow at desired speed, optimising productivity and delivering great\nresults to investors.\n\nIt is important for each organisation to first understand that the talent\nagenda is a business agenda, and not an HR agenda. It requires business\nleaders to own and drive this agenda by partnering with HR.\n\nIn my experience, a simple proven rule of success is how we can engage with\nthe business and hold business leaders accountable in driving the talent\nagenda as one of the business rhythms.\n\nSetting expectations, defining ownership and expected deliverables on talent\ntopics through acquisition, managing, developing, engaging and retaining - our\nrole in HR is to enable people leader skills for all people managers in the\norganisation and empower them to own their talent pools.\n\nHR needs to reform how we drive the talent agenda in the organisation through\nthe disruption that is happening now.\n\n### Q What can HR do to better support and add value to the organisation?\n\nHR in the disruptive world plays the pivotal role of partnering with business\nleaders to enable organisation transformation and cope with rapid changes.\n\nOur role, capability and expectations from the organisation are also being\ndisrupted and we require significant transformation to lead the organisation\nand people agenda. The HR world of back-office support no longer exists and we\nhave to shape our ways to deliver the HR function in a more strategic way,\nthis identifying business impact through HR methodology and deliverables.\n\nCritical to success in making an impact through our function lies in how we\nshift from HR-centric to business-centric. HR professionals are required to\nreskill towards high-capability business acumen, envisioning, systematic &\nanalytical thinking, stakeholder engagement, and storytelling. These are all\ncritical capabilities to enable our role to create value to the organisation\nand people.\n\nOur success is, and will be, defined by business impact as well as customer\n(both internal and external) experience, which will be driven by all HR core\nservices that align to business strategies.\n\n> ##### It is my honour to provide my viewpoint as a judge to all applicants\n> and also learn how the HR function in Thailand has developed and transformed\n> to become a critical function in each organisation.\n\n### Q For you, what is the most exciting thing about being a judge at the\n[first-ever HR Excellence Awards, Thailand 2020](http://bit.ly/39mKEhy)?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere thank you to Human Resources\nOnline for this opportunity.\n\nIt is my honour to provide my viewpoint as a judge to all applicants and also\nlearn how the HR function in Thailand has developed and transformed to become\na critical function in each organisation.

However, more than half are still in need of help developing a data-\nproficient team within their company.\n\nWhile organisations are now beginning to make use of big data to interpret\nworkplace trends and issues, many have remained preoccupied with simply\ncollecting data.\n\n[READ MORE: Are robots better than HR at 'reading'\nemotions?](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/news/general/are-robots-better-than-hr-\nat-reading-emotions/160752)\n\nIn terms of people analytics mastery, most organisations have yet to cross\nover to that stage where they can confidently analyse, act on (or solve\nexisting problems) and - ultimately - capitalise on new opportunities using\nthe numbers and trends emerging from their observations.\n\n\"Providing insights to support better decision-making is the key purpose of\npeople analytics,\" noted David Green, one of the world's leading experts on\npeople analytics, in the report. \"By bringing data to the conversation, you\ncan be more confident about your recommendations.\"\n\n[READ MORE: Big data: Why 82% of HR departments are getting it\nwrong](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/news/general/big-data-why-82-of-hr-\ndepartments-are-getting-it-wrong/125609)\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/ca/specialization/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218773)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218773)\n\n**Focus on a specific problem**  \nFor HR professionals eager to get started in people analytics, the LinkedIn\nstudy recommends launching an analytics pilot that can zero in on a particular\nproblem at their organisation.\n\nThis will enable HR to work with the company's leaders in leveraging people\nanalytics as a problem-solving tool.\n\n\"One idea - identifying reasons for turnover - is a popular objective with\nclear ROI,\" analysts from LinkedIn noted.\n\nFinancial services group Discovery, for example, built its own 'human capital\ndashboard' that monitors attrition and collates other factors, such as the\ncritical skills and demographics of top performers and turnover costs. As a\nresult, the company now has a model that can predict attrition.\n\nOf course, there is a diverse range of HR functions that stand to benefit from\npeople analytics both now and in the next five years. According to\nrespondents, these include:\n\n  * Measuring employee performance (82%)\n  * Strategic workforce planning (77%)\n  * Identifying skills gaps (70%)\n  * Evaluating recruiting channels (67%)\n  * Assessing talent supply/demand (62%)\n  * Identifying flight risks to improve retention (60%)\n  * Reducing bias in hiring/promotions (56%)\n  * Competitive intelligence (55%)\n  * Predicting candidate success (47%)\n  * Organisational network analysis (41%)\n\n[READ MORE: 10 HR tech trends set to disrupt\n2020](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/specialization/hr-technology/10-hr-tech-\ntrends-set-to-disrupt-2020/211254)\n\n**Behavioural science background**  \nBut people analytics isn't only about crunching numbers.\n\nOne unique element of the practice is how it combines the disciplines of data\nscience and behavioural science seamlessly in its interpretation of workforce\ntrends.\n\nDr. Eric Knudsen, who leads people science research at LinkedIn, believes the\ndiscipline of psychology lends credence to the effective practice of HR\nanalytics.\n\n\"We don't always behave rationally, and if we think only about the data, we'll\ndrive right by the motivations and behaviours that cause the patterns we're\nseeing,\" he told HRD.\n\n\"Remember: data is decision support,\" he said. \"Bring theory into the\nconversation, and suddenly many things begin to make a lot more sense.\"\n\nPeople, according to Knudsen, are \"much more complex than the spreadsheets\ntheir data lives in\".\n\n**' Still in its infancy'**  \n\"The best part is, people analytics is still in its infancy as a discipline,\nso there is great opportunity for newcomers to have field-wide impact,\"\nKnudsen noted.\n\n\"If you're interested in getting started, your path may vary depending on\nwhether you're already in HR or not. If you're in HR, work with your peers to\nfind out what talent questions they've always grappled with, and identify what\nbits of information could help you make a decision about how to fix it. You\nmay not have the data you need right away, but instead of throwing your hands\nup (what HR has historically done), build a way to collect that information,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"If you're asking employees for new data, communicate openly about how that\ndata will be used, and promise them you'll return with the insights you\nlearned. Follow through with that promise.\"\n\n**3 practical tips to get started in people analytics**  \nKnudsen's advice: \"Tackle one small problem at first, and make sure your\nleadership hears about it. Then tackle a slightly larger one.

For a typical\ncompany, workforce costs total up to 70% of the cost of doing business. In\nfact, several studies performed a few years ago told a convincing story:\n\n  * EY found a [strong link](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR/$FILE/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR.pdf) between CFOs\u2019 level of involvement in strategic workforce planning and broader business performance.\n  * Bersin by Deloitte found that the share prices of companies with \u201cmature\u201d talent analytics [exceeded](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-people-analytics-maturity.pdf) those of their competitors by 30% over a three-year period.\n  * A survey by CEB (now Gartner) found that organizations could [increase gross profit margin](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-decision-support/human-resources/pdfs/from-workforce-reporting-to-impactful-talent-analytics.pdf) by an average of 4%, and save roughly $12 million for every $1 billion in revenue, by taking a leadership position in workforce analytics.\n\n#### **Strategic Insight**\n\nEarly adopters of workforce analytics aimed their effort at simply managing\nthe total cost of workforce (TCOW). Today, CFOs working closely with HR can\nuse market and industry trends to identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, uncover recruitment and retention challenges,\nproject ROI from HR initiatives, and pinpoint leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nCFOs can use talent data to bring strategic insight to talent acquisition and\ndeployment by:\n\n  * Identifying ways to lower the cost of hiring, assigning, and engaging a productive workforce\n  * Ensuring compensation, benefits, and other rewards are aligned with business performance\n  * Targeting better ways of capturing ROI from HR development and well-being programs\n  * Determining and addressing signs of faltering performance\n  * Isolating mismatches in areas like benefits utilization\n  * Detecting and implementing process improvements across the workforce\n\nData and people analytics remove much of the guesswork behind key management\nand operational issues, helping companies make smarter talent decisions, boost\nperformance, and even challenge conventional wisdom that can blind\norganizations over time.\n\n#### **Linking Performance and HR Programs**\n\nData analytics also creates new opportunities for insight into the return on\nHR programs. For example, a company can look at population health and absentee\ndata alongside plan participation and rewards data, and then compare the\nfindings to productivity data in order to identify compelling corollaries\nbetween well-being and business impact.\n\nFinding out a particular demographic poorly utilizes health care screenings\nallows a company to design responsive and more effective wellness campaigns.\n\nPeople analytics can identify cost anomalies, especially in multinational\noperations where jurisdictional regulations vary widely. For example, staffing\ncosts can vary significantly by geography due to variations in salary ranges,\nbenefits costs, and employment laws. Modeling allows decision-makers to\nanalyze these costs and determine the best geographies for specific roles.\n\n[Predictive analytics](https://www.cfo.com/analytics/2016/10/special-report-\npromise-predictive-analytics/) can reveal other management decision-making\nblind spots. Suppose a company is contemplating a hiring freeze as an answer\nto declining profit. That\u2019s a common-enough scenario, but by applying\npredictive analytics it may become clear that a reduced workforce and greater\nworkload would not meet production demands.\n\nFurther analysis may reveal that hiring contingent staff, along with paying\novertime, could cost more than the savings reaped through a hiring freeze.\n\n#### **The Right Information**\n\nManaging unstructured data is a growing challenge as employers try to extract\n\u201csignals\u201d from diverse data sources, data management packages, and integration\nand forecasting tools and methodologies.\n\nThe question is what specific data and analytics CFOs and CHROs should\nprioritize to manage financial risk and ensure adequate return on labor costs.\n\nHow should companies break down workforce analytics to provide strategic\ninsight? We think there are four main areas to tap into:\n\n_Healthcare analytics_ : The combination of population health, absentee, plan\nparticipation, wellness, and related financial data can help better influence\nthe physical health of a population and help people effectively manage their\nhealth.\n\n_Financial analytics_ : Defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans,\nequity, compensation, and other personal financial data, coupled with business\ndata, helps assess the ROI on reward spend and helps employees better manage\ntheir short- and long-term financial goals.\n\n_Diversity analytics_ : Talent management, learning and development,\nsuccession planning, and related metrics can help to build work environments\nand reward structures that meet the needs of a multi-generational workforce\nand support diversity and inclusion goals. Predictive analytics can also help\nto improve recruitment and retention strategies.\n\n_Engagement analytics_ : Similar to external marketing efforts, internally\nfocused employee engagement analytics allow organizations to measure and\npredict how people react to program design, communication outreach, and market\nforces.\n\nThis combination of health, wealth, career, and engagement analytics provides\nthe insight needed to make the most effective investments in people and gives\nthem the tools they need to remain healthy and productive at work and in life.\n\nWithout that clear connection between employee performance and the\norganization\u2019s performance, managers can\u2019t properly evaluate and reward\nindividuals. Employees lose sight of where they fit into the big picture and\nbecome less engaged in the work. The company\u2019s overall performance suffers.\n\n#### **Analytics at the Right Time, in the Right Format**\n\nWhat leaders should be looking for is a single, intuitive, and responsive\nreporting system that eliminates the task of data validation and gives the CFO\nthe tools to start driving business performance.\n\nOne-off reports from disparate talent data sources \u2014 accomplished through\nspreadsheets, manual processes, IT coding, and the like \u2014 won\u2019t provide the\nstrategic insights needed to understand, predict, and monitor business risks.\n\nFind a workforce analytics platform that:\n\n  * Consolidates both financial and people data\n  * Doesn\u2019t solely rely on HRIS analytics for the evaluation of people data\n  * Gathers full people data across performance, talent, population health, engagement, and rewards inputs\n  * Establishes current-state baseline as a control measure\n  * Assesses and predicts true \u201creturn on people\u201d analysis with total cost of labor along with perceived and actual value derived from that labor, with the ability to segment to any business function\n  * Benchmarks this data against peers and ideal state\n  * Allows both HR and finance to model business and people scenarios for informed workforce decisions\n\n**Looking at Performance Through the Right Lens**\n\nToday\u2019s CFOs are not just on point to guide company financial performance.\nThey need to touch everything in the company\u2019s value chain, most definitely\nincluding the workforce. Talent analytics must become a strategic priority.\n\n_Jack Freker is CEO of_ _[Buck](https://buck.com/)_ _, an integrated HR and\nbenefits consulting, technology, and administration services provider._\n\n###### [Buck](https://www.cfo.com/tag/buck/), [Financial\nData](https://www.cfo.com/tag/financial-data/), [heath care\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/heath-care-analytics/), [Jack\nFreker](https://www.cfo.com/tag/jack-freker/), [people\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/people-analytics/), [predictive\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/predictive-analytics/), [unstructured\ndata](https://www.cfo.com/tag/unstructured-data/), [workforce\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/workforce-analytics/), [workforce\ndata](https://www.cfo.com/tag/workforce-data/)  \n\n[ ![](https://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/edd/2019/03/CFO_XCM_3-229x300.png)\n\n######\n\n### Big Data; Big Opportunities\n\n#### CFOs and their companies are becoming inundated with data.

It is working on breakthrough solutions and\ntechnologies in healthcare, life science, and performance materials in 66\ncountries, with more than 52,000 employees.\n\nAt Merck Group, HR shapes the people dimension of the business, and people\nanalytics is one of the critical focus areas of the global HR strategy to\nsupport this business vision.\n\nOver the past few years, Merck Global People Analytics and Strategic Workforce\nPlanning team have achieved several milestones ranging from implementing one\nsingle global people analytics platform to support strategic decision-making,\nto piloting innovative people analytics approaches such as network analytics,\npredictive modelling and natural language processing to support strategic\nworkforce planning.\n\n**In this exclusive interview, we speak to Alexis Saussinan, Global Head of\nPeople Analytics and Strategic Workforce Planning, who is based in Singapore\nand has witnessed firsthand the implementation of this people analytics\nmindset in the global organisation.**\n\n### Q What was the business need for implementing such technology?\n\nThe business need for us goes beyond just technology. We leverage people\nanalytics as a one of our core capabilities in HR to empower leaders to make\ninformed strategic decisions, encourage curious and passionate talent to solve\nthe most complex problems, and further develop results-driven teams and\nnetworks.\n\nTo achieve these strategic business and people objectives, we benefit from an\namazing sponsorship from our senior leaders as well as close partnerships with\nkey bodies and committees such as our Works Council.\n\nThis gives us very strong foundations to support Merck Group\u2019s current and\nfuture successes in the era of digitalisation, industry 4.0, and beyond!\n\n### Q What were the main challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?\n\nRaising awareness about new and innovative domains like people analytics is\nnever easy, and comes with its set of challenges around convincing HR and\nbusiness leaders about what\u2019s in it for them.\n\n\u201cHow can people analytics help deliver strategic impact?\u201d, \u201cData is great, but\nso what?\u201d These are some of the questions regularly being asked that can\nrepresent challenges and barriers to the adoption of a people analytics\nmindset.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we have tried and tested several different\napproaches in an agile manner to identify what works (and what doesn\u2019t!). For\nexample, we realised that it does not work when you mainly position people\nanalytics as just a tool or technology. People are already overwhelmed with\ntools in their professional and private lives. What works is when you focus on\nuser experience and embed people analytics in our colleagues\u2019 journeys.\n\n> ##### We started by implementing a single global people analytics platform,\n> leveraging more than 100 millions of pre-approved, relevant and accurate\n> real-time data points.\n\n### Q On the other side of the spectrum, how did you drive engagement and\nadoption?\n\nTo drive people analytics' adoption and reinforce our analytical thinking\ncapabilities, we re-purposed several business marketing techniques such as\nuser persona definition, journey mapping, consumption, and usage analytics.\n\nFor example, we came up with regular, practical bite-size insights\u2019 campaigns\ncalled 'Did you know?', proactively pushing relevant and actionable insights\nto our community at the right time during the year.\n\nIn Q4, we created a 'Did you know?' around how to leverage people analytics as\npart of yearly business planning. In Q1, we had another 'Did you know?' around\nthe impact of performance and rewards\u2019 differentiation to drive high employee\nengagement.\n\nIn addition, we work very closely with our global HR leaders to identify\nstrategic focus areas where we want to pilot innovative advanced people\nanalytics techniques and 'practically' show the impact that people analytics\ncan have at scale for the organisation.\n\nTo deliver on these pilots, we come together in small global cross-functional\nagile teams for a period of time and work in iterative sprints to deliver\ntangible outcomes. These outcomes are then assessed and, for most impactful\nand promising results, we look for upscaling opportunities either on targeted\nbusiness or people areas or even at Merck Group level.\n\nA recent example is when we brought together different business, HR and\ntechnology colleagues to work on an advanced people analytics and machine\nlearning platform.\n\nThis platform combines multiple data sources into one single intelligent\ninterface that predicts future business and people scenario outcomes while\nproactively pushing actionable recommendations to business and HR leaders for\nthem to anticipate and influence these scenario. This solution showed great\nbusiness impact potential and is currently being further rolled-out globally.\n\nThe examples above are only an extract of our continuous focused efforts on\ndeveloping the core people analytics capabilities of our HR community, while\nalready preparing for the future with steps in predictive modelling,\nartificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n### Q In developing people analytics expertise and products in-house, what is\nyour secret? Where did you start?\n\nI wish there was one secret \ud83d\ude42\n\nFor us at Merck, it all started with a strong focus on building the right\nfoundations. We started by implementing a single global people analytics\nplatform, leveraging more than 100 millions of pre-approved, relevant and\naccurate real-time data points.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we decided to open this platform globally not only to\nHR colleagues, but also to business leaders in all transparency (more than\n4,000 users in total). This was already a bold move that proved to be right\nchoice, as transparency was the key for us when we started and it still is.\n\nFrom there, we accelerated fast and step-by-step. We delivered small tangible\nand successful pilots that showed the impact of people analytics, for example\n'identifying diversity sweet spots in teams to drive innovation', and used\nthese credentials to further raise awareness across the organisation.\n\nWe identified and leveraged some HR and business key influencers and people\nanalytics ambassadors to further increase reach and impact. We used some of\nthe most impactful corporate events, such as our yearly global executive\ncommittee meeting, to showcase Merck\u2019s people analytics capabilities (we even\nwon an award there!).\n\nIn addition, we always ensured that we are part of the right networks to learn\nand contribute to the global people analytics community by sharing with other\ncompanies and leveraging best practices.\n\nFor example, we regularly partner with external institutes and universities to\nperform some foundational research related to specific people analytics\ntopics. Collaborating and co-developing with the external people analytics\necosystem is a strong focus of ours and part of our approach towards new ways\nof working.\n\n> ##### We also developed and grew the team in a pragmatic manner by adding\n> the right targeted capabilities and roles we needed to realise our strategy.\n\n### Q As the people analytics pathway started to take shape, how did you, in\nturn, equip the team internally to succeed at this new product?\n\nFrom a people analytics' team perspective, as we advanced our journey, we also\ndeveloped and grew the team over the last few years in a pragmatic manner by\nadding the right targeted capabilities and roles we needed to realise our\nstrategy. Some of the capabilities we added over the years included tech\nskills, business acumen, consulting, data science, marketing, and of course HR\ncontent expertise.\n\nWe always operated as a global team, with different team members' work\nlocations in Europe, US and Asia. This was another success factor that helped\nus work on strategic topics at corporate level, without ever losing touch with\nthe businesses and regions on the ground.\n\nThese focused actions helped us achieve very strong results and gave us\nfoundations to engage into the next steps of our strategic roadmap towards\n'enhanced' people analytics.\n\n### Q What are key results that the use of technology has brought about at\nyour organisation?\n\nTo date, we have been able to drive a very strong adoption and usage of our\navailable people analytics capabilities by our HR and business communities (we\ntrack these numbers every month as part of our team performance scorecard).\n\nAs an outcome of that, all key strategic people discussions at Merck now make\nuse of people analytics data and insights. For example, we leverage people\nanalytics to define and review our global HR strategy, enhance our corporate\nstrategic talent management programmes, and support strategic business\ntransformations such as mergers and acquisitions or innovation-driven\ninitiatives.\n\nThese are just examples and we still have a long way to go, with one clear\nstrategic objective in mind: contribute to having HR shape the people\ndimension of Merck!\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Functions\n\n[Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/analytics/) [Latest\nNews](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\n[December 1, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/12/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-analytics-automation-drives-\ngreater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/#comments)\n\n![People Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/HR-Analytics123-1024x582.png)\n\nOrganizations have widely adopted the innovations of analytics to streamline\ntheir business operations and improve processes. Intending to achieve the\nability of reduced costs, increase in profitability and risk-management\nimprovement, nearly 97 percent of organizations today have adopted analytics\nwithin their system.\n\nWith the omnipresence of analytics, everything is tracked, analyzed and\noptimized based on derived insights. Organizations are figuring out what is\nuseful for their businesses, which skill is more effective in the current\nmarketplace.\n\nA variety of departments have followed the footprints to drive business\nstrategies and better decision-making system. But amid this, HR lags behind in\nincorporating a more quantitative approach.\n\nHR is a discipline that conventionally works around empathy, not facts. Due to\nwhich natural biases can drive strategic decisions about the workforce.\nTherefore, to remove such loopholes in the HR system, it is extremely\nquintessential for organizations to guide a series of workforce-discussions\nand decisions based on data.\n\nAccording to a study, around 84 percent of HR professionals say people\nanalytics are important whereas only 22 percent have already adopted analytics\nfunction. Well, the disparity can be considered as people data is an extremely\nchallenging form of big data.\n\nFortunately, owing to the evolution of bots and intelligent automation, the\nlengthy and manual processes of HR are getting depleted. The automation in HR\nfunctions is also enabling it to enhance its impact through more data-driven\nstrategies.\n\n\n\n#### **The Usefulness of Intelligent Automation**\n\nFor the new future of work where a huge amount of data is generated every day,\nrobotics and intelligent automation have become the largest drivers for\nefficiency. Both technologies are displacing workers in certain types of\nroles. For example, Bots are excellent at high-volume, transactional, and\nrules-based work, therefore they can handle building data centers and models.\n\nThe latest introduction of people analytics solutions has turned analytics\ninto more democratized and universal. People no longer need to be an expert to\ntake advantage of such data. Intelligent automation parses through all the\npeople\u2019s data for HR teams and brings relevant insights to the table.\n\nAlso, there are now pre-built people analytics solutions that will help people\nfind the answers to critical business queries.\n\n\n\n#### **Bots for Escalating Insights**\n\nCurrently, **** business leaders are in habit of having their KPIs on a set of\ndashboards but soon robotics will comb through analytical platforms (like\nVisier) to identify upcoming problem areas and escalate them to leaders.\nNotably, a bot could flag someone in HR automatically when employee turnover\naccelerates in a particular department. As not all leaders are consistent\nanalyzers of people analytics, therefore bot can inform and alert them when\nit\u2019s necessary. This will subsequently help [HR\nleaders](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/10-innovative-hr-analytics-\nsolutions-providers-2019/) tackle potential problems before they increase.\n\n\n\n#### **Organizing HR Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics tools invest a lot of time in sorting and identifying which\nquery they should solve first. Here, the ability of bots to organize and\nprioritize queries can enhance the efficiency of the process.\n\n\n\n#### **Prospects of Automation in HR**\n\nAs robotics and intelligent automation are still evolving, they possess a huge\npotential to transform HR from being qualitative to focusing on factual, data-\ndriven and actionable insights.\n\nImplementing technologies that flags potential problems, helps HR deal with\nreal-time issues while empowering organizations to increase their business\nimpact. Shortly, employees will use solutions that blend data and robust\npredictive models to make better decisions.\n\nAs the conventional hiring tools are massively reduced, revamped workforce\ntools will balance the employee supply and demand cycle. This will radically\ntransform the people management and HR functions.\n\n[Human Resources](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/human-resources/)\n[People Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/people-analytics/)\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/&title=People\nAnalytics Automation Drives Greater Efficiency for HR Functions) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-\nfunctions/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/HR-Analytics123.png&description=People Analytics\nAutomation Drives Greater Efficiency for HR Functions)\n\n## Related Analytics Articles\n\nSimilar Posts From Analytics Category\n\n[ ![Predictions for the Future of Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AI-\nPredictions-173x130_c.jpg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/predictions-for-\nthe-future-of-artificial-intelligence/)\n\n#### [Predictions for the Future of Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/predictions-for-the-future-of-\nartificial-intelligence/)\n\n[October 21, 2018](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2018/10/)\n\n[ ![Report: Top Analytics Developments That Took Place In\n2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-\nAnalytics-Developments-That-Took-Place-In-2019-173x130_c.png)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/report-top-analytics-developments-that-\ntook-place-in-2019/)\n\n#### [Report: Top Analytics Developments That Took Place In\n2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/report-top-analytics-developments-that-\ntook-place-in-2019/)\n\n[December 27, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/12/)\n\n[ ![The Amalgamation of Data Science and\nNeuroscience](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/60122W_Brains-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/the-amalgamation-of-data-science-and-\nneuroscience/)\n\n#### [The Amalgamation of Data Science and\nNeuroscience](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/the-amalgamation-of-data-\nscience-and-neuroscience/)\n\n[January 12, 2020](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2020/01/)\n\n## No Comments so far\n\nJump into a conversation\n\n### No Comments Yet!\n\nYou can be the one to start a conversation.\n\n###  [Click here to cancel reply.](/people-analytics-automation-drives-\ngreater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/#respond)\n\n__**Your data will be safe!** Your e-mail address will not be published.

from work due to COVID-19 could cost employers more than $23 billion\nin benefits for absent workers, impacting up to 5.6 million employees, new\nresearch finds.\n\nThe staggering figure comes from the Integrated Benefits Institute, which\nassessed potential sick leave wages, short-term disability payments and\nspending on employee benefits for absent workers. IBI used employment, wage\nand leave benefit data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and lost workday\nexperiences contained in IBI\u2019s dataset of employer-sponsored STD claims to\nmodel lost work time impacts for low-, mid- and high-range scenarios depending\non the total COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\nIn terms of the costs of COVID-19 absences, \u201cwhat we might see play out are\nthe implications of employers\u2019 decisions about emphasizing care management and\nsupport for healthy lifestyles as part of their overall benefits strategies,\u201d\nsays Brian Gifford, research and analytics director for IBI. \u201cThat could turn\nout to be important not only for leave payments, but for some people the\ndifference between whether or not they needed scarce resources such as\nventilators in order to pull through. We may not know the answer to that until\nwe are able to get a look at employees from different companies with different\nbenefits policies and see how they fared during and after the pandemic.\u201d\n\n[**Read all of _HRE_ \u2019s coronavirus coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)\n\nUp to 5.6 million employees could be impacted by coronavirus-related leave,\nIBI notes, with nearly 3 million workers at firms with fewer than 500\nemployees entitled to paid leave per the Families First Coronavirus Response\nAct that went into effect April 1.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things to keep in mind is that this analysis\nassumes a pretty low rate of very serious, ICU cases\u2014about 8% of the total.\nThat keeps absence durations relatively short,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cBut at least\nfor younger workers, those serious cases are driven by complications such as\ncardiovascular conditions and diabetes\u2014things that unfortunately are not\nuncommon in the workforce, and which impose productivity burdens under the\nbest of circumstances.\u201d\n\nIBI\u2019s analysis follows other research that indicates the significant cost\nCOVID-19 is having on benefits. [Willis Towers\nWatson](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/), for instance, recently found that\nemployer healthcare costs could increase up to 7% this year due to coronavirus\ntreatment and testing costs\u2014on top of the 5% increase companies had already\nprojected before the pandemic. That analysis finds that a 30% infection rate\ncould increase medical and prescription drug costs between 4% and 7%,\ndepending on how sick COVID-19 patients become.\n\n**Related:** [Here\u2019s how much employer healthcare costs could increase due to\ncoronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/)\n\n\u201cDespite employers and employees taking the right precautions at this perilous\ntime, the coronavirus continues to spread and place enormous pressure on our\nnation\u2019s healthcare system,\u201d says Trevis Parson, chief actuary at Willis\nTowers Watson. \u201cThis spike in the demand for care is likely to lead to a\nsignificant jump in employer healthcare costs beyond previous expectations.\u201d\n\nGifford adds that the best benefits cost control strategy for employers is\n\u201cminimizing exposure to infections by enforcing social distance policies where\npossible and operating safely when the work has to continue for essential\nservices.\u201d\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference. She has covered benefits for the better part of a\ndecade, and her stories have won multiple awards, including a Jesse H. Neal\nAward and honors from the American Society of Business Publication Editors and\nthe National Federation of Press Women.

In that role, HR would have immeasurable influence on the\norganization.  Leveraging data, tools and insights - HR teams could provide\nsound, data-based guidance to leaders.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, vice president of enterprise surveys and analytics with\nPerceptyx, says it's easy to see why.\n\n\"Numbers allow us to quantify impact.  They identify linkages between actions\nand reactions. Analytics can help HR separate the nice to know from the need\nto know, and direct us to those policies and practices that will help the\norganization achieve its objectives.\"\n\nIt sounds promising, but how to get started?\n\nIn her webinar, Dr. Johnson will help HR teams understand that People\nAnalytics is within their reach. Start at the beginning, and provide your\nleaders with simple but impactful insights.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n  1. Learn what it takes to make a simple, but powerful, start to people analytics.\n  2. Hear a case study of how one company used employee engagement survey data to evaluate leadership development programs.\n  3. Understand the steps you can take now to get started in people analytics.\n\n\n\n_Photo courtesy:   StockPhotoSecrets_\n\n**Presenters:**\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/sarah-\njohnson-2.jpg) [ **Sarah Johnson**\n](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/sarah-johnson)  \nVP, Enterprise Surveys and Analytics  \nPerceptyx\n\nSarah reveals that she never wanted to run a company, but did aspire to be a\n\"strategic influencer\" \\- the person behind the CEO to answer \"What advice do\nyou have to help me make this decision?\"\n\nAnd that is just what Sarah does.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, Vice President of Enterprise Surveys and Analytics at\nPerceptyx, Inc., has more than two decades of experience in her field. She\nspecializes in employee engagement, organizational development and\neffectiveness and survey data analysis - advising senior leaders at Fortune\n500 firms around the world.\n\nSarah witnesses executives struggling across industries with such common\nchallenges as leading a global company through transformational change,\nleading successfully in turbulent times, and driving employee engagement and\nretention among high-potential employees. Sarah says she is most often asked\nby clients how to leverage employee engagement to drive organization strategy.\nHer clients rely on her to capture the attention of senior leadership in a way\nthat \"makes the light bulb go off in their heads\" when discussing employee\nengagement and alignment.\n\nSarah says she believes that companies need people who are not just book\nsmart, but \"maze bright\" - people who can adapt to different cultures and\ncontinually changing circumstances. As she puts it, those people who can \"read\nthe signs and figure out where to go from here.\"\n\nSarah, an industrial/organizational psychologist, began her career by\nhappenstance: she initially wanted to become a clinical psychologist. One day\nSarah's father, a metallurgist and head of research laboratory, described how\na group of consulting psychologists helped his leadership team make hiring and\nexecutive succession decisions based on background gathered from leadership\nassessments. \"My father helped me see how psychology could be used in a\ncorporate setting, which led me into the field of organizational psychology\"\nshe says.\n\nSarah works with clients around the world, from as far north as Denmark to as\nfar south as Brazil. She enjoys the travel global consulting entails,\nexperiencing different cultures and getting out of her comfort zone, which she\nattributes to the fearlessness and abilities she acquired as a child growing\nup near the city of Chicago, which she explored every chance she had.\n\nSarah received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Purdue University, and\nholds a Master of Arts degree and PhD in industrial organizational psychology\nfrom The Ohio State University. Prior to joining Perceptyx Sarah was a Global\nPractice Leader at CEB. Prior to CEB, she led the global organizational survey\nprogram at IBM, and held a number of HR positions at IBM that gave her\nexperience in Employee Relations, Compensation, and Resource Planning. Sarah\nbegan her professional career at Procter & Gamble.\n\nWe respect your privacy, by clicking \u2018Watch On Demand\u2019 you agree to receive\nour e-newsletter, including information on Podcasts, Webinars, event discounts\nand online learning opportunities.

Acquisition?\n\n[Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/analytics/) [Latest\nNews](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\nby [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/ \"Posts by\nVivek Kumar\") [January 28, 2020](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2020/01/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/can-people-analytics-benefit-\nbusinesses-acquiring-top-talent/#comments)\n\n![](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How_Can-\nPeople-Analytics-Help-Businesses-in-Acquiring-Top-Talent.jpg)\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly changing and advanced world, finding talents that fulfill\norganizations\u2019 needs is much more intricate. Even, competition for top talent\nwill be among companies\u2019 top challenges this year. Most companies make use of\nbig data analytics to get an edge over their competition. As data are being\nleveraged to comprehend every part of a business operation, analytics tools\nare being inserted into day-to-day decision making. However, the use of data\nanalytics is now practicing as people analytics in the HR section.\n\nPeople analytics typically is the analysis of a business\u2019s personnel data in\norder to get meaningful insights. With these insights, companies can know how\nto use their personnel to accomplish more as a company. In HR, people\nanalytics experiencing a seismic shift.\n\nDriven by the prevalent adoption of cloud HR systems, businesses are investing\nheavily in programs to utilize data for all aspects of workforce planning,\ntalent management, and operational improvement.\n\nAs per the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), HR professionals\nbelieve the most critical competency for showing business acumen in the coming\nyears will be understanding HR and organizational metrics and analytics.\n\n\n\n#### **Applying People Analytics**\n\nReportedly, the early adopters of people analytics were professional sports\nteams. The management of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, for instance,\nexcellently pioneered the application of enhanced data modeling. Nearly all\nmajor-league teams have now integrated people analytics into their sport\u2019s\ntraditional models of talent management.\n\nHere are some ways of how people analytics benefits companies looking for top\ntalent.\n\n\n\n#### **More Effective Talent Acquisition**\n\nEarlier, acquiring new candidates was based on the interaction and intuition\nof the hiring manager. However, this has not always been reliable and\nefficient as the hiring processes are becoming more difficult with the rise of\nthe competitive business landscape. Most people analytics teams rely on data\nanalytics, saving significant time HR professionals spend on manually\nscreening potential additions to their team. People analytics also makes\ntalent acquisition more effective by trimming down implicit bias that could\notherwise arise when the entire hiring process is manually done.\n\n\n\n#### **Reduce Employee Turnover**\n\nBy leveraging people analytics, businesses can find out the reason behind the\nemployee exits and figure out how to lessen the turnover. They will also be\nable to solve these problem areas by finding out innovative ways using people\nanalytics so that employees can feel comfortable using their talents at\norganizations. In the same context, data analytics classify the areas of a\ncompany\u2019s setup, structure and culture that make leaders so appealing to\nemployees. Afterward, they can focus on intensifying this factor in order to\nenhance employee retention, engagement and productivity.\n\n\n\n#### **Improve Employee Training**\n\nTraining is a significant aspect of hiring and retaining quality employees for\nbusinesses. It depicts that companies are assisting employees in realizing\ntheir full potential and encourages them to learn new skills in their field of\nexpertise. If they don\u2019t do so, this can result in employee debilitation, poor\nemployee morale, and a lack of direction. Thus, people analytics here helps\norganizations, enabling them to carry out their responsibilities in training\nand skilling their employees. With people analytics, they can find this out\nand create methods to score the training outcomes. If the training courses and\nmethods are futile, it can also enable businesses to pivot those that offer\nbetter results.\n\n\n\n#### **Enhancing Business Performance**\n\nAs a growing number of businesses are applying analytics for recruiting and\nretention, they are more able to see a clear link between talent and\nleadership pipelines, cost reduction, and efficiency gains. Considering a\nstudy by Bersin by Deloitte, companies that leverage talent analytics or\npeople analytics to support business decisions perceive an 82 percent higher\nthree-year average profit than their counterparts. Moreover, people analytics\nis also being applied to a broad array of business challenges and recruiting\ntalent remains the major area of focus, followed by performance measurement,\ncompensation, workforce planning, and retention.\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/can-\npeople-analytics-benefit-businesses-acquiring-top-talent/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/can-\npeople-analytics-benefit-businesses-acquiring-top-talent/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/can-\npeople-analytics-benefit-businesses-acquiring-top-talent/&title=How Can People\nAnalytics Benefit Businesses in Talent Acquisition?)

HR analytics is defined as the\nprocess of measuring the impact of HR metrics, such as time to hire and\nretention rate, on business performance._\n\nHuman resources is a people-oriented function and is so perceived by most\npeople. But for those who think that the HR team\u2019s contributions are limited\nto extending offer letters and onboarding new hires, human resource analytics\n(HR analytics) can prove them wrong. When used strategically, analytics can\ntransform how HR operates, giving the team insights and allowing it to\nactively and meaningfully contribute to the organization\u2019s bottom line.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nIf you are looking to get started with HR analytics, this guide is for you.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is HR Analytics?**\n  * **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n  * **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n  * **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n  * **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\n## **What Is HR Analytics?**\n\nTo understand the essence of HR analytics and to explain how it impacts\nbusiness performance, we asked Mick Collins, Global Vice President, Workforce\nAnalytics & Planning Solution Strategy and Chief Expert at SAP SuccessFactors,\nto break it down for us.\n\n\u201cHR analytics is a methodology for creating insights on how investments in\nhuman capital assets contribute to the success of four principal outcomes: (a)\ngenerating revenue, (b) minimizing expenses, (c) mitigating risks, and (d)\nexecuting strategic plans. This is done by applying statistical methods to\nintegrated HR, talent management, financial, and operational data,\u201d says\nCollins in an exclusive discussion with HR Technologist.\n\nHR analytics focuses primarily on the HR function and is not \u2013 as is largely\nbelieved \u2013 exactly interchangeable with **[people\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\npeople-analytics/)** or workforce analytics.\n\n### I. HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce Analytics: What is the\nDifference?\n\nThe terms HR analytics, people analytics, and workforce analytics are often\nused interchangeably. But there are slight differences between each of these\nterms. It would help you to know the difference to be able to assess the most\nrelevant data to their function.\n\n![The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics**\n\n**HR analytics:** HR analytics specifically deals with the metrics of the HR\nfunction, such as time to hire, training expense per employee, and time until\npromotion. All these metrics are managed exclusively by HR for HR.\n\n**People analytics:** People analytics, though comfortably used as a synonym\nfor HR analytics, is technically applicable to \u201cpeople\u201d in general. It can\nencompass any group of individuals even outside the organization. For\ninstance, the term \u201cpeople analytics\u201d may be applied to analytics about the\ncustomers of an organization and not necessarily only employees.\n\n**Workforce analytics:** Workforce analytics is an all-encompassing term\nreferring specifically to employees of an organization. It includes on-site\nemployees, remote employees, gig workers, freelancers, consultants, and any\nother individuals working in various capacities in an organization.\n\nIn the HR context, some workforce analytics metrics and HR analytics metrics\nmay overlap, which is why the two terms are often used as synonyms. The goal\nof the two may also be the same.\n\nFor instance, data on employee productivity and performance informs both HR\nand workforce analytics, and the goal is to improve retention rates and\nenhance the employee experience.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Human Capital Management\n(HCM)?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)\n\n### II. How Does HR Analytics Drive Business Value?\n\nHR has access to valuable employee data. How can this data be used to enable\nchange in the organization?\n\nThere is a great deal of discussion on replicating the consumer experience in\nthe employee experience. Essentially, the data on consumer behavior and\nmindset can help develop strategies to maximize sales by capitalizing on those\nfactors. Similarly, the data useful for the HR function can be used to improve\nemployee performance, the employee experience, and in turn, maximize business\noutcomes.\n\nCollins offers an example of how HR analytics can be used to enhance business\nvalue. \u201cHR analytics could be used to measure investments in reskilling, which\nwill deliver the right competencies to support a new revenue model, using\ndata-driven insights to modify the training offering as sales results emerge.\u201d\n\nThis is definitive granular data that can not only impact the bottom line, it\ncan also transform **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** in an organization.\n\n\u201cAs such,\u201d Collins continues, \u201cyou might think about the \u2018ROI\u2019 of HR analytics\nbeing that of increasing the business value derived from using data for talent\ndecisions.\u201d\n\n## **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n\n**![Common metrics measured by HR analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common metrics measured by HR analytics**\n\nSeveral HR metrics contribute to business value, but the key question when\nmeasuring these metrics is this: what does the business need?\n\nThis question can be best answered by having a conversation with business\nleaders. A strategic collaboration between the C-suite and HR leaders will\nhelp determine the HR analytics strategy.\n\nBased on the key performance indicators (KPI) of the organization, HR can then\npropose the metrics that can influence these KPIs.\n\nIt is important to note that the C-suite sees a clear connection between the\nneed for analytics and the impact it will have on the bottom line. As an HR\npractitioner, you will need to build a case for why tracking metrics related\nspecifically to the people of the company is critical.\n\nFor instance, the C-suite may not be interested in the number of people who\nhave left the organization voluntarily. What might interest them is how many\nof these employees were in strategic positions or were highly skilled, the\nduration of their employment, what led to their exit, the cost of replacing\nthese employees, and finally, how all these events affect company profits.\n\nHere are some common metrics tracked by HR analytics:\n\n**1\\. Revenue per employee:** Obtained by dividing a company\u2019s revenue by the\ntotal number of employees in the company. This indicates the average revenue\neach employee generates. It is a measure of how efficient an organization is\nat enabling revenue generation through employees.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rate:** The number of accepted formal job offers (not\nverbal) divided by the total number of job offers given in a certain period. A\nhigher rate (above 85%) indicates a good ratio. If it is lower, this data can\nbe used to redefine the company\u2019s talent acquisition strategy.\n\n**3\\. Training expenses per employee:** Obtained by dividing the total\ntraining expense by the total number of employees who received training. The\nvalue of this expense can be determined from measuring the training\nefficiency. Poor efficiency may lead you to re-evaluate the training expense\nper employee.\n\n**4.** **Training efficiency:** Obtained from the analysis of multiple data\npoints, such as performance improvement, test scores, and upward transition in\nemployees\u2019 roles in the organization after training. Measuring training\nefficiency can be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program.\n\n**5\\. Voluntary turnover rate:** Voluntary turnover occurs when employees\nvoluntarily choose to leave their jobs. It is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left voluntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can lead to the identification of gaps in the\n[**employee experience**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/) that are leading to voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n**6\\. Involuntary turnover rate:** When an employee is terminated from their\nposition, it is termed \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The rate is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left involuntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can be tied back to the recruitment strategy and\nused to develop a plan to improve the quality of hires to avoid involuntary\nturnover.\n\n**7\\. Time to fill:** The number of days between advertising a job opening and\nhiring someone to fill that position. By measuring the time to fill,\nrecruiters can alter their recruitment strategy to identify areas where the\nmost time is being spent.\n\n**8\\. Time to hire:** The number of days between approaching a candidate and\nthe candidate\u2019s acceptance of the job offer. Just like time to fill, data-\ndriven analysis of time to hire can benefit recruiters and help them improve\nthe **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nto reduce this time.\n\n**9\\. Absenteeism:** Absenteeism is a productivity metric, which is measured\nby dividing the number of days missed by the total number of scheduled\nworkdays. Absenteeism can offer insights into overall employee health and can\nalso serve as an indicator of employee happiness.\n\n**10\\. Human capital risk:** This may include employee-related risks, such as\nthe absence of a specific skill to fill a new type of job, the lack of\nqualified employees to fill leadership positions, the potential of an employee\nto leave the job based on several factors, such as relationship with managers,\ncompensation, and absence of a clear succession plan. HR analytics can be used\nto measure all these metrics.\n\n## **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n\nBroadly, the data required by an HR analytics tool is classified into internal\nand external data. One of the biggest challenges in data collection is the\ncollection of the right data and quality data.\n\n**![Common data sources HR analytics solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common data sources HR analytics solutions**\n\n**I. Internal data**\n\n  \nInternal data specifically refers to data obtained from the HR department of\nan organization. The core HR system contains several data points that can be\nused for an HR analytics tool. Some of the metrics that an HRIS system\ncontains includes:\n\n1\\. Employee tenure  \n2\\. Employee compensation  \n3\\. Employee training records  \n4\\. Performance appraisal data  \n5\\. Reporting structure  \n6\\. Details on high-value, high-potential employees  \n7\\. Details on any disciplinary action taken against an employee\n\nThe only challenge here is that sometimes, this data is disconnected and so\nmay not serve as a reliable measure. This is where the data scientist can play\na meaningful role. They can organize this scattered data and create buckets of\nrelevant data points, which can then be used for the analytics tool.\n\n**II. External data**\n\n  \nExternal data is obtained by establishing working relationships with other\ndepartments of the organization. Data from outside the organization is also\nessential, as it offers a global perspective that working with data from\nwithin the organization cannot.\n\n**1\\. Financial data:** Organization-wide financial data is key in any HR\nanalysis to calculate, for instance, the revenue per employee or the cost of\nhire.\n\n**2\\. Organization-specific data:** Depending on the type of organization and\nits core offering (product or service), the type of data that HR needs to\nsupplement analytics will vary.\n\nFor example, says Collins, \u201cHR leaders at a global retailer should power their\nanalytics engine with store revenue and costs and customer experience data,\nwhereas HR at a construction company might pursue operational \u2013 health and\nsafety \u2013 data and data related to contingent labor costs.\u201d\n\n**3\\. Passive data from employees:** Employees continually provide data that\nis stored in the HRIS from the moment they are approached for a job.\nAdditionally, data from their social media posts and shares and from feedback\nsurveys can be used to guide HR data analysis.\n\n**4\\. Historical data:** Several global economic, political, or environmental\nevents determine patterns in employee behavior. Such data can offer insights\nthat limited internal data cannot.\n\nFor example, the recession in 2008 was a global event that changed the way\nemployees perceived jobs or \u201cwork.\u201d The freelance, start-up and gig economies\ntook off as people continued to lose their jobs. Data from such a critical\nhistorical event can help predict how the workforce may react to similar\nshifts in the future. It can then be used to identify trends in the current\nworkforce and predict voluntary and involuntary turnover.\n\n## **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n\nFor HR leaders keen to **get started with using HR analytics** for data-based\ndecision making, here are some tips:\n\n**![The complete HR analytics cycle](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The complete HR analytics cycle**\n\n### **I. Create a collective mindset**\n\n  \nBefore the operational and mathematical aspect can kick in, HR leaders must\nprepare their teams and organizations for a workflow-driven by analytics.\n\nWhile the discussion with the C-suite for the need for analytics is one part\nof the change, the other is preparing your team to deal with the amount of\ndata that they will now be using to measure the change.\n\nThis is a crucial aspect of **[HR\u2019s digital\ntransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)** as well as company-wide\ndigital transformation. Getting the team started on small projects and asking\nthem to create the reports that they will discuss with business leaders is a\ngood way to begin.\n\n### **II. Bring in data scientists**\n\n  \nThe data scientist is expected to become an integral part of HR teams. They\nare best suited to assess the viability of an analytics solution. They can\nalso ensure the robustness of the statistical modeling and predictions.\n\nAs Collins says, \u201cdata scientists will play an invaluable role in creating a\nculture of analytics across HR. As the role of HR business partners and\ngeneralists evolves to include skills such as data strategy, analysis, and\ncommunication (articulating \u2018the story behind the science\u2019), the data\nscientist will serve as the coach, mentoring their colleagues across HR in how\nto understand, and apply, the insights.\u201d\n\n### **III. Start small**\n\n  \nA great technique to convince stakeholders that HR analytics can drive\nbusiness value is to first implement a small project successfully. Called\n\u201cquick wins,\u201d these projects can deliver tangible results in a short amount of\ntime with high impact.\n\n### **IV. Get clearance from the legal team**\n\n  \nThe sort of data collection that HR analytics uses is governed heavily by\ncompliance laws. Some legal considerations to keep in mind when implementing\nan HR analytics solution are:\n\n  1. Employee privacy and anonymity\n  2. Consent from employees about the amount and type of data being collected\n  3. Establishing the goal of data collection and informing employees accordingly\n  4. IT security when using third-party software to run HR analytics\n  5. Location of the HR analytics vendor \u2013 with whom the data will be stored \u2013 and their compliance with local laws\n\n  \nCollaborate with the legal team of your organization to ensure ethics and\ncompliance norms are followed.\n\n### **V. Choose an HR analytics solution**\n\nAny HR analytics solution that will be used at scale must have certain\ncomponents.\n\n**![The key features of an HR analytics solution](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The key features of an HR analytics solution**\n\n**1\\. They answer the business questions the C-suite asks.** This may require\nthat you invest in a solution to address each question, leading to investments\nin multiple analytics solutions for granular data on each question.\nAlternatively, you may choose a unified solution that can assess multiple\nmetrics to answer each business question.\n\n**2\\. They are easy to use by individuals who are not data scientists.** An\naccessible solution created for laypersons is ideal when they want to assess\nany one or more metrics without interrupting the workflow of the data\nscientist.\n\n**3\\. They are cloud-based rather than on-premise.** A cloud-based solution\nalso aids accessibility without heavy IT integration. This grants HR the\nautonomy to use the solution as and when needed.\n\n**4\\. They are powered with statistical analysis and machine learning\ntechnology.** Big data platforms require advanced data management systems\npowered by machine learning and natural language processing. This allows the\ntechnology to learn and reason autonomously, revealing insights that data\nscientists can then analyze.\n\n**5\\. They are based on predictive analytics.** \u201c[Predictive analytics is] the\npractice of extracting information from existing data sets to determine\npatterns and forecast future outcomes. Analysts use statistical methods to\nforecast future alternatives \u2013 will the current termination rate continue at\nthe same pace or might we expect a surge of exits as the job market\nstrengthens?\u201d explains Collins.\n\n**6\\. They are powered with visualization technology.** A visual\nrepresentation of vast amounts of data can allow for better understanding of\ntrends and events. The complex data processed through an analytics engine\nrequires advanced visualization software, as it cannot be presented in simple\ncharts and presentations.\n\n**7\\. They are available through a subscription model.** Subscription models\nof software as a service (SaaS) platforms are useful because they easily allow\nyou to access the latest upgrades in technology. They also eliminate the\nsignificant upfront expense of purchasing an analytics solution and may be a\nmore cost-efficient way of investing in analytics.\n\n## **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\nHR analytics offers some undoubted benefits. It allows HR teams to\nsignificantly streamline processes that reduce costs, reduce attrition, and\nconsequently improve the bottom line.\n\nWith task automation, you are freed up to innovate and explore the human\naspect of human resources without spending time on tracking mountains of data\nfrom multiple sources.\n\nOverall, the use of HR analytics has been established as an HR technology\ntrend for 2019, as it is posed to improve the employee experience that\ndirectly translates into improved business outcomes.\n\nHowever, it also presents some real challenges.\n\nAs Collins tells us, \u201cWhile HR is ambitious about the use of predictive HR\nanalytics, two HR leaders I recently spoke with said \u2018we want to be able to\npredict everything!\u2019 The vision for how analytics will become an HR core\ncompetency is being constrained by limited consumption (insights being shared\nonly within the four walls of HR) and action (the research does not lead to a\nprogram change or new investment). There is still much progress to be made.\u201d\n\nIn addition, because data is siloed across the organization and conversations\nabout the goal of implementing analytics are unclear, the valuable data HR\nrequires for analytics is often underutilized.\n\nThe challenge is in waiting to actually see results. Predictive analytics is\nlikely to take a minimum of 24 months to show meaningful results, but it will\nhelp get started with HR transformation.

[Future London](/futurelondon)\nspeaks to [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/)'s director of talent solutions\nUK, Janine Chamberlin, to find out.\n\n## **What is 'people analytics'?**\n\nPeople analytics is a data-driven approach to understanding critical insights\nabout your workforce, which can enable better business decision-making.\n\nData from HR systems and business operations can be analysed to inform HR\npolicies, business practices and the human capital element of the workforce.\n\nThis intelligence, which is derived from human behaviour, can help companies\npre-empt challenges, innovate and plan ahead.\n\n## **Why is people analytics important to HR and recruitment?**\n\nCompanies have realised that they hold valuable data which, when harnessed,\ncan help them make more informed decisions, at speed, improving their\ncompetitive agility.\n\nAnalysing employee data can help companies gain critical early warning signs\ninto skills gaps and shortages, business performance and enable strategic\nworkforce planning.\n\n[\n\n  * Read more\n\nWe must address the digital skills gap, says Anisah Osman Britton\n](/futurelondon/skills/why-the-digital-skills-gap-needs-to-be-addressed-says-\nanisah-osman-britton-a4165946.html)\n\nHR professionals are increasingly being asked to analyse data to find patterns\nand trends that will lead to budget and labour efficiencies, better hiring\noutcomes, and smarter decision-making across a range of strategic issues.\n\nLinkedIn has seen that nearly three quarters (72%) of HR and talent\nprofessionals say that people analytics will be a major priority to their\norganisation in the next five years.\n\n## **What are the skills needed to interpret people analytics?**\n\nHR and Talent professionals need to have the analytical skills to develop a\nhypothesis, convert data into insights and develop strategic recommendations.\n\n[\n\n  * Read more\n\nHow to up your CV\u2019s digital credentials  ](/futurelondon/skills/digital-\nskills-cv-recuritment-a4328666.html)\n\nDoing so enables them to better communicate opportunities and challenges to\nleadership based on real-time data, which can justify budget reallocation,\nhelp companies reach their hiring goals, or help better plan and deliver more\neffective employer branding initiatives.\n\n## **What infrastructure does people analytics require?**\n\nCompanies need infrastructure that allows them to access employee data\nsecurely and analyse it responsibly.\n\nEnsuring the right safeguards are in place is crucial to helping companies\nremain GDPR compliant and maintain the trust of their employees.\n\nThere are a variety of technologies available, from applicant tracking systems\n(ATS) and human capital management systems to insights platforms.\n\nMore about: | [ future london skills ](/topic/future-london-skills) | [ Future\nLondon ](/topic/future-london)\n\n[ HomeCreated with Sketch. ](/ \"Home\")\n\n## Follow us:\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/eveningstandard)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/standardnews)\n\n[All Topics](/topics-list) [All Authors](/author-list) [Archive](/archive)\n[Terms of use](/service/terms-of-use-6902768.html) [Contact\nUs](/service/contact-evening-standard-7185764.html) [Privacy\npolicy](/service/privacy-policy-6925316.html) [Cookie policy](/service/cookie-\npolicy-7785319.html) [Code of Conduct & Complaints](/service/code-of-conduct-\ncomplaints-7467885.html) [Advertisers](http://esimedia.co.uk/) [Promotion\nrules](/service/promotion-rules-6914218.html)\n[Contributors](/incoming/external-contributors-terms-conditions-for-\nfreelancers-bloggers-and-contributors-of-user-generated-8717657.html)\n[Syndication](https://www.esimedia.co.uk/syndication) [Homes &\nProperty](https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/)\n[Jobs](http://independentjobs.independent.co.uk/) [London\nLive](http://www.londonlive.co.uk/) [The\nIndependent](https://www.independent.co.uk) [This is London\nMagazine](http://www.thisislondontickets.co.uk/)\n[indy100](https://www.indy100.com) [Install our apps](/staticpage/applanding)\n[Voucher Codes](/vouchercodes)\n\n"}, {"item": "More companies upskill HR teams to handle people analytics rather than hire out -

Emond](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=148145) and Ellyn Maese\n\n![COVID-19 Strategies and Policies of the World's Largest\nCompanies](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/rfpjezg9o0kd1bqawrhuca.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * New teams are critical for developing policies and providing information\n  * Learn COVID-19 protocols and business contingency plans\n  * Monitor impact and conduct assessments to sustain business function\n\n> _Gallup Managing Director Larry Emond_ _gathered the strategies and policies\n> of 100_ _members of the CHRO Roundtable, an organization that includes the\n> CHROs of more than 650 of the world 's largest companies, for their\n> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in this sampling average\n> $27 billion in revenue with 80,000 employees and most are global\n> organizations. This is what Emond found._\n\n### **Crisis Management Teams**\n\nMost organizations have created crisis management teams, task forces or\ncommittees with a response tailored to specific geographic regions. These task\nforces meet regularly to develop policies and provide information to leaders,\nmanagers and front-line employees regarding COVID-19 awareness, prevention,\nmanagement and hygiene practices.\n\nThese teams are also focused on management protocols and business continuity\nplans to guide current actions and forecast possible responses to future\nevents. In general, their protocols and plans include:\n\n  * developing succession contingencies for all major executives\n  * conducting business using virtual, video or audio capabilities\n  * restricting travel\n  * reducing to business-critical operations only\n  * moving critical operations to unaffected regions\n  * cross-training team members to perform critical functions in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of another team member\n  * documenting business-critical functions, processes or procedures in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of a team member\n  * distributing call center scripts and agent communications\n\nIf an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, many companies have established\nprotocols like these:\n\n  * Require employees to report confirmed cases -- either of self or family member -- of COVID-19 to HR or management. The affected are typically required to stay home for 14 days and/or until cleared by a doctor to return to work with confirmation that there is no diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  * Isolate employees diagnosed at work; immediately disinfect objects they've touched; trace their contact with other employees, customers, and clients; and notify those who may have been exposed without releasing the diagnosed employee's name.\n  * Ask employees to log all contact with other employees or visitors in case they become symptomatic so that others can be informed of potential exposure.\n\n### **Travel Requirements**\n\nMost companies have recommended limiting personal and professional travel, and\nsome have assured workers they could decline professional invitations without\npenalty. Generally called soft bans, these partial travel restrictions have\nbeen issued with requests to inform HR of travel and avoid air travel, public\ntransportation and large gatherings, as well as 14-day self-quarantines\nfollowing travel to affected areas.\n\nHowever, hard bans are in effect in many companies, and travel to China,\nItaly, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan has been prohibited.\nIndeed, most intercontinental travel -- and, more recently, even travel in\ngeneral -- has stopped for the time being, unless it's mission-critical.\n\n### **Business Impact**\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions. Many companies with facilities in\naffected areas have closed them and are canceling their own -- or their\nemployees' presence at -- conferences, events and face-to-face meetings. Some\nhave been able to move operations to unaffected locations.\n\nSimultaneously, CHROs are:\n\n  * monitoring supply chains or providers for potential impacts\n  * conducting ongoing supply chain risk assessment and operation impact assessment\n  * considering alternative suppliers\n  * preparing for shortages, transportation delays or communication delays\n  * approving additional budget for supplies or additional paid time off\n  * reducing or suspending bonuses for top earners\n  * analyzing and forecasting potential market impacts\n\n### **Wellbeing**\n\nCompanies are also assessing risks to their [employees' physical and financial\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-\nwellbeing-high.aspx). Their mitigation efforts include:\n\n  * instituting mandatory work-from-home or [remote work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288956/covid-teams-working-remotely-guide-leaders.aspx) policies where possible\n  * closing on-site facilities such as gyms, cafeterias and common areas\n  * making revisions to employee compensation and benefits policies\n  * granting paid time off for symptomatic employees, employees who must care for family members who are diagnosed with COVID-19, and/or employees with diagnosed cases of COVID-19\n  * using standing sick leave, extended sick leave, vacation time, paid time off or flex-time policies\n  * increasing sick leave or paid time off for all or on a case-by-case basis\n  * utilizing short-term disability, family leave (FMLA) or other existing benefits\n  * recommending available Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n  * reminding employees about mental health services for [stress management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257501/charge-work-stress-starting-managers.aspx)\n  * using back-up care programs, childcare subsidies or other dependent care benefits\n  * refraining from penalizing time off of any kind\n  * permitting unlimited unpaid time off without penalty\n  * providing travel/international SOS (medical and travel security) services\n  * paying for time spent under quarantine\n  * [offering work-from-home options](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/263510/manage-remote-employees.aspx) or adjusting schedules due to school closures\n  * communicating employer-sponsored insurance and other relevant benefits\n  * advising employees to avoid public transportation\n  * staggering shifts to help employees avoid busy commutes\n  * advising employees to avoid visiting high-traffic events or locations on personal time\n  * reconfiguring meeting rooms, break rooms and other common areas to promote social distancing\n  * expanding the time of meal service to avoid congestion, and asking employees to consider alternate meal times to reduce crowds\n\n### **Technology**\n\nThese companies are testing technological (e.g., remote work) capabilities,\nemergency notification systems and updating employee contact information.\nThey're advising employees to take their laptops or other portable equipment\nhome each night, and they are devoting IT staff to help employees set up\nremote connections at home, sometimes on employees' personal computers.\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions.\n\nMany companies have required or are encouraging video or audio-conferencing\nmeetings (e.g., Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) or phone calls in lieu of face-\nto-face meetings. They also recommend conducting collaborative projects by\nvideo or audio-conferencing, Google Docs, emails or other online channels.\n\n### **Communications**\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols. Many are issuing FAQ guides, and many are including\nlinks to authorities and external organizations such as the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), The World Health Organization (WHO),\nJohns Hopkins University, local governments and outbreak maps.\n\nAlong with expert advice, these messages often include a genuinely personal\nelement, i.e., reminding workers to get information from credible\norganizations, assuring them that none of their fellow employees have tested\npositive for the virus (where applicable) and urging employees not to panic or\nspread rumors. They will also often encourage employees to obtain enough food,\nwater, medicines and other essentials for their families in case of quarantine\nor scarcity.\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols.\n\nCommunications are usually tailored to the recipients -- whether leaders,\nmanagers, employees or clients/customers, respectively -- and methods include:\n\n  * social media for public messages\n  * email, mail, text messages, hotlines and internal systems (i.e., intranet) to propagate pertinent information\n  * signage to reinforce hygiene, screening and other organizational policies\n\nMembers of the CHRO Roundtable are conscious of the effects of their\ncommunication, particularly on customers. To that end, many have:\n\n  * Proscribed responses from managers/leaders if contacted by the media. Many have designated media relations personnel who address all questions from the media.\n  * Asked employees not to violate the privacy of diagnosed employees or clients/customers in social media messages.\n  * Deployed social media and marketing messaging about customer policies and alternative commerce/services.\n\n### **Training**\n\nBusinesses are rapidly expanding training opportunities. Much of it concerns\nmanagers, who are being tasked with assisting in coronavirus containment,\nresponding to employee needs or concerns, and communicating disease-management\npolicies and preventative measures, such as hygiene practices. But CHROs are\nalso creating COVID-19-specific training programs for security professionals,\ncleaning crews, maintenance and groundskeeping staff.\n\nThese protocols and responses, we're told, will be operational as long as is\nneeded -- the end of May is the current long-term projection -- and all are\nsubject to revision. Gallup will continue to report on our findings as the\nsituation evolves.\n\n### **Discover these crucial resources to better prepare your company during\nthis disruption:**\n\n  * [Watch our live webinar \"COVID-19: Managing Your Workforce Through Disruption\"](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2227447/9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B?parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy) to get everything Gallup knows about disruption and other crises.\n  * Read about how to [manage the loneliness and isolation of remote workers in this article](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268076/manage-loneliness-isolation-remote-workers.aspx).\n  * Read about \"The Changing Place and Space of Work\" in Gallup's [_State of the American Workplace report_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx), which includes research on remote work trends and best practices.\n\nLarry Emond is Managing Director of Global Leadership Advisory at Gallup.\n\nEllyn Maese is a Research Associate at Gallup.\n\n_Jennifer Robison contributed to this article._\n\n[\n![](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/SPEEDBUMPS/jfrv8v85vegptqw9if7wcw.png)\nDeep Dive  What Is Employee Engagement, Really?

HR professionals must be conversant in HR analytics\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### Dr Fermin Diez _, Adjunct Professor, Singapore Management University\n(SMU), on how the HR function will be delivered very differently than it is\ntoday, given the impact of digitalisation, artificial intelligence and\nrobotics._\n\nA 2018 survey by David Green and Ian Bailie at\n[myHRfuture](https://www.myhrfuture.com/) identified key skills HR\nprofessionals need to develop in order of their future importance:\n\n  * People analytics\n  * Digital HR/HR technologies\n  * Change management\n  * Consulting and influencing\n  * Agile working\n  * Strategic workforce planning\n  * Ethics & data privacy\n  * Design thinking\n  * Stakeholder management\n  * Diversity & inclusion\n  * AI, robotics & future of work\n  * Employer branding\n\n\u201cPeople analytics\u201d came in as most important, along with \u201cdigital HR/HR\ntechnologies\u201d. And yet, the next two were \u201csoft\u201d skills such as change\nmanagement and consulting/influencing. It is clear HR professionals need to\nbecome more analytical, but it is equally clear the profession needs to also\nstay grounded on its human aspects.\n\nIn line with these results, we believe all HR professionals must be conversant\nin HR analytics, if the function is to be effective at improving individual\nperformance, enhancing employee experience, and helping to achieve business\ngoals.\n\nHR professionals traditionally have shied away from gaining basic data\nliteracy skills, including data visualisation, finance and statistics. HR\npractitioners need to become more analytical if they wish to keep pace with\nthe new demands on the profession and be an integral part of a more data-\ndriven, yet human-grounded, future of the HR profession.\n\n### A glimpse of the HR future\n\nThere are analytics capabilities built into most new and upcoming software\nofferings, which have increased our ability to collect and analyse data. This\ndata holds the promise to help HR analytics teams understand how they can\nimprove the employee experience.\n\nReal-time sentiment and emotion recognition analysis is a fast-growing field,\nwhich is increasingly being used to measure how employees are feeling. There\nis technology to analyse a person\u2019s facial nano expressions and gauge their\nemotions such as happiness, anger or sadness. It can also predict if the\nperson is truthful or surprised. Similar technology for voice analysis is\nalready available.\n\nBiosensors and wearables are widely available for personal health and fitness,\nproviding data for physiological metrics (heart rate, sleep patterns, blood\npressure, etc.), as well as various environmental metrics (distance, altitude,\netc.).\n\nSimilar devices are used in the workplace to help improve health & safety \u2013\nfor example, devices can be worn by truck drivers to alert them if they are\nfalling asleep while driving. Other devices are being used in high-volume work\nsettings to help improve productivity by alerting employees when they are not\nfocused or when their stress levels are too high.\n\n> ##### The handling of sensitive information on an employee\u2019s health or\n> feelings must be handled with extreme care.\n\nHowever, future applications do not need to be so individualised. Improving\nany HR process is a good opportunity to apply a design-thinking mindset; get\nfeedback from users, supervisors, vendors and other stakeholders; use the\nfeedback to redesign the process; pilot the new approach; and collect data to\nsee if it is better than the old process. Is it cheaper/faster/better and does\nit help to increase productivity/revenues/profits? Does it make the employee\nexperience better?\n\nMany questions remain about this ability to track and use data. We need to\novercome the lack of skills to analyse the data. Technology, and the resulting\ndata, must be validated, especially when it comes to interpreting feelings and\nthoughts.\n\nThe new technologies have access to sensitive areas, raising concerns about\ndata storage and usage, and there may be some who want to hoard or misuse this\ndata, which will lead to regulation at some point on how it can be used and\ninterpreted.\n\nPersonal data protection legislation is already in place in many jurisdictions\nand will likely continue to evolve rapidly as technologies become more\npowerful and available.\n\nThere will also be many HR professionals and employees who will resist change.\nThe handling of sensitive information on an employee\u2019s health or feelings must\nbe handled with extreme care.\n\nThe HR function will need to continuously monitor and update its policies and\ncommunicate these to employees \u2013 about what type of data is being collected,\nfor what purpose, for how long, where it is stored, and the data protection\nmechanisms in place.\n\nWhatever the future holds, it is an exciting time to be an HR professional!\n\n* * *\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\n_Excerpts from this article were first published in[Human Resources\u2019 August\n2019 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine.

So much in fact, it's getting harder and harder to see the\nboundaries between the two topics.  It would even be fair to say they two,\ndata and human resources, are forever linked.  In the last decade, there have\nbeen huge advancements.  Take data gathring for instance.  HR continues to\ngather information through annual employee engagement surveys, but also\nthrough social media and in-house employee platforms.  Additionally, with the\nhelp of artificial intelligence, data is being pulled in an automated-fashion\nfrom candidate resumes.\n\nThere have also been advancements in analysis.\n\nHR professionals are becoming more data literate and proficient.  They are\nable to look at data and, from it, tell the employee 'story'.  There are also\nseveral vendor-led solutions that provide a technology component to analysis.\nAs with data gathering, some vendors are offering an artificial intelligence-\npowered platform to pinpoint specific variables or trends.\n\nData is being using to formulate strategies around recruitment, internal\nemployee networks and retention as well as learning.  It's even being used to\ndetermine which employees are at a risk for leaving the organization and to\npre-determine which positions will likely be open in the coming weeks and\nmonths.  For the first time in HR history, human resources professionals can,\nin some small way, predict the future of the workplace.\n\nData is almost the proverbial 'crystal ball'.\n\nThe HR Exchange Network has written a plethora of articles on these topics and\nhas shared just as many from contributors and thought leaders around the\nworld.  As we move into 2020, here are the Top 10 HR Data Articles of 2019.\n\n# Best of HR Data\n\n**1\\. Leveraging Social Capital**\n\n\"There should be little doubt that human capital is a firm's greatest asset.\"\nBut General Motors chief talent officer Michael Arena says companies have to\ndo more such as making sure employees are in the right place to be successful.\nIt's not enough for HR to bring in the best people.  Companies also have to\nbring out the best in people.  That requires HR to \"intentionally leverage\nsocial capital.\"  In his latest contribution to the HR Exchange Network, Arena\nexplains why organizations need to \"deliberately focus on unleashing the\nlatent potential of the talent that they already employ.\"  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/leveraging-\nsocial-capital) to read more.\n\n**2.** **Network Energy is the New Employee Engagement**\n\nDisengaged employees are more likely to quit than those that are engaged.  In\nhis latest article for the HR Exchange Network, Amazon Web Services VP of\nTalent and Development Michael Arena says employee engagement, today, is\n\"lagging measurement of something much more immediate, network energy!\"  If\nyou're unfamiliar with the term, network energy specifically refers to the\nlinkages between employees on any given team.  For more information on this\nand how to leverage positive energy to the betterment of the employee, team\nand company, [click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-\nanalytics/columns/network-energy-is-the-new-employee-engagement).\n\n**3\\. Why Relationships are The Next Great Advancement in People Analytics**\n\nHR loves data.  That isn't going to change anytime soon.  Data is the key to\nmeasuring ROI, but also predicting outcomes of certain situations and even\npredicting, for instance, when a person might leave their job and when to\nstart hiring for that \"soon-to-be-open\" position.  Knowing that, Visier Chief\nStrategy Officer Dave Weisbeck says there are four key changes every HR\nprofessional \"needs to understand and start measuring - to help their\norganizations.\"  Weisbeck says that includes outcomes replacing rules and\norders and continuous change, just to name a few.  For more details, [click\nhere](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/why-relationships-\nare-the-next-great-advancement-in-people-analytics/).\n\n**4\\. How to help HR improve its literacy in data and people analytics**\n\nData-based decision making is a rising focus for the HR professional.  So much\nso, there is a lot of attention being placed on creating a culture that\nsupports that type of decision making.  In their article, Patrick Coolen, Jaap\nVeldkamp, Ingrid Bienefelt and Martijn Vosz discuss a training exercise\nconducted at ABN AMRO to help HR professionals further their understanding of\npeople analytics by improving their data literacy.  [Click\nhere](https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2019/1/9/how-to-improve-hrs-data-\nliteracy) for more.\n\n**5.** **Diversity at the Core of the Network**\n\nDiversity is critical to the development of resilience in organizations and\n[bottom-line results across time](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\naquisition/news/diversity-and-inclusion-the-business-case).  In his latest\npiece for the HR Exchange Network, Amazon Web Services VP of Talent and\nDevelopment Michael Arena uses data science to prove his case, specifically\npointing to a real-life example.  He mapped out a network of nearly 500\nindividuals within a large service-based organization that needed to be highly\nadaptive. What he found will surprise you.  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/diversity-at-\nthe-core-of-the-network) to read more about the case and his findings.\n\n**6\\. Big HR Data Is Here: How Do You Use It?**\n\nWhen it comes to the use of data, HR gets a little squirmy.  Data can be very\nintimidating, especially if it's not something the HR professional is used to\nusing.  In her inaugural article on the HR Exchange Network, Novant Health VP\nof HR Operations Vaso Perimenis explains not only how big data is of value to\nHR, but also how to build the analytics capability from the ground up.\nPerimenis provides step-by-step instructions on the process and provides\ndetails about each step.  Read her [article\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/big-data-is-\nhere-how-do-you-use-it).\n\n**7\\. GDPR Compliance: Tips and Myths**\n\nIf a company is global, the likelihood is high that it has and will continue\nto come in contact with the European Union's General Data Protection\nRegulation, or GDPR.  Companies headquartered in the EU spent a considerable\nabout of time preparing for the new regulation before it went into effect in\nMay of 2018.  Many are still working to meet compliance today.  But the\nregulation, while specifically applying to companies in the EU, also impacts\ncompanies outside the EU.  If a company in the United States, for instance,\nemploys workers in an EU country they are required to follow the GDPR.  That\nmeans the company's HR department is going to have to be GDPR compliant.\nFailing to do so will result in fines.  So, how do companies outside of the EU\nwork to become GDPR compliant?  [This\narticle](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employment-law/articles/gdpr-\ncompliance-tips-and-myths) answers that question.\n\n**8.** **Assessing your HR Analytics Capability**\n\nHR loves data.  So much so, analytics has become quite the buzzword across HR\ndepartments globally.  But with so many different concepts involved, the noise\naround analytics in HR can be quite deafening.  Human resources thought leader\nDave Ulrich, in his latest piece, explains what analytics actually is and why\nHR wants to pursue it as a strategy.  He also explains some of the key points\nof data HR wants to look at and use.  In the end, Ulrich provides a way for HR\nto assess its own analytics efforts.  Read more\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/assessing-\nyour-hr-analytics-capability).\n\n**9.** **Why Human Resources and Analytics make a Great Team**\n\nIn his piece for Associations Now, Ernie Smith says there is growing evidence\nthat human resources departments benefit from analytics more than any other\ndepartment within a company.  Smith quotes a report from Oracle which says HR\nhas \"quickly leapfrogged into one of the most valuable departments for\ncorporate analytics\", faster than other departments such as finance.  More can\nbe found [here](https://associationsnow.com/2019/04/why-human-resources-and-\nanalytics-make-a-great-team/).\n\n**10.** **Blockchain Realities in Recruitment**\n\nEvery HR professional tasked with finding the best talent for their companies\nis looking for tools to aid them in the charge.  Some are turning to AI.\nOthers are employing a change in their benefits strategy that makes the\ncompany more attractive to job candidates.  Of course, those are just some of\nthe more popular ones.  Then there are those options that are more \"pie in the\nsky\" concepts, at least that's what they seem to be at the moment.  Among\nthem:  blockchain.  Read more [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntalent-aquisition/articles/blockchain-realities-in-recruitment).\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

You can\nprobably imagine lengthy and complex spreadsheets or pie charts and graphs\npresenting all kinds of averages and counts.\n\nIn Greek, the word \"ana\" means above and \"lysis\" means solution, which results\nin \"beyond solution\". As a child, my parents used this word frequently to\nencourage thinking through problems, as they spoke to me in Greek. Analysis\nand problem solving is a part of me, while spreadsheets, pie charts and graphs\nare merely tools. In and of themselves, they will provide lots of information,\nbut unlikely to provide a \"beyond solution\".\n\n# Big Data Literacy\n\nAnalysis has always been an important part of work, and Human Resources has\nhistorically been reticent to adopt data literacy, analysis and insights as\nkey capabilities. As organizations drive towards talent strategies and an\nuplifted employee experience, as part of HR's realignment of its fit-for-\npurpose, analytics adoption is an essential component towards the maturity of\nthe Human Resources function. Strategic use of people data will solve business\nproblems. Organizations must make decisions based on sound data analysis. As\nSherlock Holmes stated, \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has\ndata. Insensibly, one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of\ntheories to suit facts\".  Is data available for analysis? If available, we\nneed to engage objectively in the analysis to allow the data to inform our\ndecisions, rather than justify our theories.\n\n## Analytics Capability\n\nHow do we start to build the [analytics\ncapability](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-\nanalytics/articles/assessing-your-hr-analytics-capability)? HR leaders can\ntake several steps to build the foundation.\n\n  1. Educate yourself. \n    1. Learn as much as you can about workforce analytics. Read books, take online courses, attend conferences. Network with experts and ask many questions.\n    2. Understand analytic approaches. Each type offers valuable insights and as your capability matures, you will use all approaches. * \n      1. **Descriptive Analysis.** This is a view into an activity that includes volumes, cuts or costs.\n      2. **Related Analysis.** This approach offers insights related to performance against requirements or standards. If you have a service level agreement, then measuring performance against the agreement is a related analysis.\n      3. **Analytical Analysis.** This answers questions regarding the relationship between activities and outcomes, such as the quality of newly hired employees and turnover in the first year of employment, or the relationships between a high assessment score and improved retention.\n      4. **Predictive Analysis.** This identifies statistical relationship between multiple activities and outcomes to predict what will happen in the future.\n\n  *  \n\n> Related Whitepaper:  [How to Become A Data-Driven\n> Organization](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-\n> analytics/whitepapers/how-to-become-a-data-driven-organization)\n\n  2. Begin your journey by collaborating with your information technology (IT) business intelligence team. \n    1. Discuss your goals and solicit ideas and guidance. Obtain commitments for the necessary resources that will be required to establish workforce analytics capabilities. Much like Human Resources, IT departments have challenges managing capacity and demands from the business. Ensuring that you have collaborated with the senior IT leader committed to the goal, ensures proper resource allocation and support.\n    2. Discover your company's current analytics ecosystem. Learn about the tools, data architecture and strategies. Moreover, most importantly, understand HR's role in that ecosystem.\n  3. Create the infrastructure. \n    1. Hire the right talent skilled in: \n      1. Data validation, data mart and data model development.\n      2. Using statistical platforms such as R or SAS. They should also know burgeoning languages such as Python. The talent should have a degree in analytics or statistics and know how to create data models. In the beginning, the data repository you create may not have all the necessary data elements. But the data scientist can use disparate and manual data sources to begin testing hypotheses and formulating the business questions.\n      3. Basic reporting to answer simple questions. It is best to separate reporting from data science functions.\n\nDepending on the available investment, you will need a leader of the analytics\ncapability to create the roadmap, understand the business questions, connect\nwith the business to understand and meet needs. If investment is limited, then\nthe HR leader who oversees this and perhaps other capabilities must have\ndirect and frequent oversight of the function.\n\n  4. Build the data repository. \n    1. During this process, it is best to convene a small HR team that can blue sky a high-level product to document required data elements and sources. There is no need, at this point, to have a detailed map of your visualizations. You simply need to understand the overall direction and goals of your end product to inform the data collection.\n  5. Pilot, experiment and iterate. \n    1. As the data warehouse is populated and validated, start designing visualizations. Identify the part of the business experiencing the most significant talent challenges. As a healthcare example, given the Registered Nurse shortage, I piloted visualizations for acute care inpatient nursing leaders. The nursing leaders needed access to basic information such as turnover and vacancy rates over time, counts of hires and terminations, net hires and number of applicants in the hiring funnel, etc.\n    2. Based on feedback from this group, we updated and iterated the visualizations in preparation for publishing to a wider audience.\n  6. Find the quick wins to establish credibility. \n    1. There are many business needs and those that have the most airtime in executive and finance circles are usually going to get the most attention. Before you engage in any work, ensure that you have a willing customer. Although a project, on its face, may have tremendous merit, if the customer is not committed or engaged with the project, don't spend the money or the time. Commitment must come from the senior leader.\n\nAs you establish your analytics capability, it is critical the HR business\npartners have access to relevant data at their fingertips. This HR team\nconnects directly to the business. They are a key enabler to circulate facts\nand fight false beliefs and assumptions. As Sherlock suggested, theorizing\nbased on facts is the best way to find solutions.\n\nFinally, create a multi-year roadmap. Although this may seem counter intuitive\ninitially, it is best to create your multi-year roadmap after you have laid\nthe analytics foundation. As you build the foundation, and increase your\nknowledge, you can identify some short-term goals. The vision and roadmap will\nfollow.\n\n## In Summation\n\nAs you embark on your journey, here are a few items that may require your\nattention.\n\n  1. Information technology departments may change analytics tools, strategies and partnerships with vendors that may affect your analytics capability development. Create a strong partnership with your information technology team.\n  2. Once you have created your data repository, HR should retain ownership of HR data. One of the benefits of having a data warehouse is to merge workforce and other business data to create insights. It is essential that HR consults on all data being extracted from the repository to ensure proper understanding and use of the data.\n  3. Many times, when evaluating data, process patterns will emerge. If the pattern is not expected, you may need to evaluate the underlying process or procedures.\n\nAbove all, have courage as you create this new capability. If you research,\nread, learn from experts, ask many questions, and tolerate setbacks, you will\nfind success!\n\n  \n* Arthur Mazor, Deloitte Consulting, \"Talent Acquisition Analytics\".\n\n\n\n> Want to know more about Big Data?

This idea is one I have always found\nfascinating:** someone entering into the workforce today would have an\nexperience that looked nothing like the experience of someone hired a\ngeneration ago. And when you roll back the clock far enough, **you can uncover\nsome really fascinating examples of this:** during the industrial revolution,\nalarm clocks were too few and too unreliable and so \u201cknocker-uppers\u201d had the\njob of waking people up to ensure they made it to work on time. While this\nhistory may be interesting, we need to understand there are real business\nimplications to ignoring more recent changes in work.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhat has dramatically changed, in as little as one generation, is the very\nnature of how work gets done. The modern work environment is more complex and\nrequires both greater social and technical skills. Ad-hoc teams that span\ncultures and geographies have time-pressure to meet goals that are more\ncognitively complex. Both subtle and dramatic changes have been behind the\nchanging nature of work. Constant pressure for organizations to be lean, the\nend of lifelong careers at a single employer and new technologies have changed\nwork over time. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen upheaval in the work being done\nas the economy switches to be services-based. Since the year 2000, six million\nmanufacturing jobs were lost, which exceeds job losses experienced during the\nGreat Depression, while healthcare has seen 9 million new jobs and doubled in\nsize.\n\nAlso Read: [What We\u2019ve Gotten Wrong About HR\nTransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-weve-gotten-wrong-about-hr-transformation/)\n\nThere are four key changes in how work is done that every HR professional\nneeds to understand - and start measuring - to help their organizations\nnavigate this new way of working :\n\n  * **Outcomes replacing rules and orders:** the assignment of tasks is giving way to the assignment of goals where employees are expected to be problem solvers to meet an objective.\n  * **Ad-hoc teams replacing hierarchical structure:** teams that are formed for a project are increasingly more important than the organizational hierarchy.\n  * **Cross-functional work replacing departmental focus:** the complex and lean nature of work requires individuals to work across the company to collaborate and knowledge share.\n  * **Continuous change** : with re-organizations, new competitors, new technology, faster promotion cycles, and project-based work an employees goals are changing ever more frequently.\n\n  \nWith all of this change and complexity, where do you begin? As Peter Drucker\nfamously quoted, \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t improve it.\u201d A common\nthread across these changes in how work is done is the need for collaboration,\nbut how do you measure the effectiveness of ad-hoc, cross-functional teams\ncollaborating on a common goal? A starting point is the Organizational Network\nAnalysis (ONA).\n\n**ONA is a relatively new discipline that brings the analysis of people\nnetworks to the workforce**. If we think of the approach in contrast to\nengagement surveys, which tell us about the relationship of an individual to\nthe company, ONA tells us about the relationship of an individual to their\nfellow employees. It can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of\ncollaboration and knowledge sharing that are occurring between individuals,\nproject teams, departments or other important groups in the organization.\nSimilar to engagement, ONAs real power shines when it is combined with people\nanalytics.\n\nFor example, have you ever noticed that the resignation or termination of an\nemployee tends to have a ripple effect? One person\u2019s exit can effectively\ncreate a domino effect, with entire departments losing critical talent. ONA\ncan help organizations understand what relationships are centered around\ncritical employees, and how their absence can cause it to collapse. This\nanalysis can also reveal surprising insights, such as despite the first\nemployee who left not being considered a \u201chigh performer\u201d, yet they were the\nones that your organization\u2019s star talent rallied around. With that individual\nno longer in the picture, you\u2019ve lost a critical relationship influencer and\nmay find your top employees are at risk of leaving as well.\n\nSimilarly, by reviewing ONA you may notice an employee has very few\nconnections which is likely to impact their productivity or turn them into a\nflight risk. This analysis gives you an opportunity to make changes to ensure\nthey increase the number of connections they have within your organization.\nConsider assigning projects outside of their usual work to expose them to\nother team members, engaging them in social work events to increase their\ninformal network, or taking an active role in introducing them to key team\nmembers.\n\nONA goes beyond merely understanding the connections within your organization,\nand how to best manage them. It can inform strategic business objectives like\nDiversity and Inclusion. Manish Goel, CEO of TrustSphere, has an anecdote of a\ntrillion-dollar asset management firm that used ONA to understand why there\nwere fewer women receiving promotions, despite the company hiring an equal\nnumber of entry-level male and female employees. Network insights helped the\ncompany identify gender differences in developing working relationships in\ncorrelation with promotion data.

Farm/Shutterstock\n\n**With data skills increasingly critical for success in the HR profession, new\nanalysis from XpertHR reveals three priority areas for HR metrics data\nactivities in 2020.**\n\n### XpertHR data resources\n\n**[People analytics: good practice

This is according to\nFermin Diez, Mark Bussin and Venessa Lee, authors of \"Fundamentals of HR\nanalytics\", a book providing practical guidance on using data to inform and\nimprove HR policies and practices.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, all HR professionals will need to demonstrate both an\nunderstanding and practical experience of data-driven decision making, they\nargue.\n\nHR professionals looking to make use of analytics should focus on metrics that\ncan drive actions directly benefiting their organisation. \"Solve for business\nproblems, not HR symptoms,\" Diez, Bussin and Lee advise. \"If HR wants to be\nheard, it needs to be able to put HR arguments in business language, meaning,\nusing data that link HR decisions to business outcomes.\"\n\nXpertHR senior HR practice editor Noelle Murphy agrees. \"The most powerful\nmetrics are those that can demonstrate a return on costs and investment,\" she\nsays, speaking in a recent [podcast on essential HR\nmetrics](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/audio-and-video/podcast-key-hr-metrics-and-\npriorities-for-the-year-\nahead/164366/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa).\n\nSo where should HR professionals focus their data and analytics activities in\n2020?\n\nThe box below reveals three key metrics that matter to HR, based on traffic\ndata for XpertHR's Benchmarking tool over the past year reveals.\n\nLooking ahead, XpertHR analysis of trending HR metrics data topics highlights\nthree areas set to place high on the HR agenda for 2020: resourcing;\nretention; and employee wellbeing.\n\n### Resourcing\n\nA strong labour market means that the competition for good job candidates is\nfierce. \"We're in a very tight labour market so roles are more difficult to\nrecruit for,\" Murphy says. This is driving up recruitment spend for many\nemployers.\n\nCost per hire is on the rise for 40% of organisations taking part in XpertHR's\nlatest [ key recruitment metrics survey](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/survey/975/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa).\nA focus on employers looking to fill mid-level vacancies reveals that the\nmedian cost per hire for managers is \u00a33,500 for 2019/2020, up from \u00a33,000 a\nyear earlier.\n\n### HR metrics 2020: Three essential people data points\n\n**[Labour turnover (voluntary resignation rate)](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/228775/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Absence rate](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/226747/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Number of employees per HR staff member](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/225786/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n### Retention\n\nAnother symptom of the buoyant labour market is that retention is a key data\npriority area for HR.\n\nLabour turnover rates have shown a steady increase since 2012, in line with\nthe gradual strengthening of the labour market.\n\nThe median voluntary resignation rate stands at 12.9% according to [XpertHR\nresearch](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/survey/945/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\nconducted in 2019, up from 8.9% in 2012. One in three employers (34.6%) says\nlabour turnover has increased at their organisation over the past 12 months.\n\n### Employee wellbeing\n\nAs employers look to boost retention among their existing workforce and\nimprove their employer brand to entice new hires, employee wellbeing\ninitiatives - including managing mental health in the workplace - will become\nan increasingly important part of HR's workload.\n\nMore than half of employers (54.4%) run informal employee wellbeing\ninitiatives, while one in five (22%) has a formal programme in place, [XpertHR\ndata](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/survey/913/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\nshows.\n\nOne-third of employers (32.8%) allocate a specific budget for employee\nwellbeing activities. Among this group, the median annual spend per employee\nis \u00a336.36.\n\n[Managing mental health in the workplace](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/survey/946/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\nis likely to represent a particular area of focus for employee wellbeing\ninitiatives. 88.1% of employers say that some of their employees took sickness\nabsence due to mental health issues in the past 12 months. But only 21.1% have\na mental health strategy or policy in place.\n\n### Data skills are essential for HR in 2020\n\nFor HR data and analytics initiatives to be effective, they must be grounded\nin a thorough understanding of the organisation's strategic objectives, and of\nhow people data can be used to drive the achievement of these objectives. This\nmeans that the most valuable metrics for each HR department will vary\naccording to their organisation's strategic priorities.\n\nBut for Diez, Bussin and Lee, there is little doubt that building and\ndemonstrating data and analytics skills is essential for all HR professionals\nin 2020 and beyond. \"For new HR professionals, analytics will become the price\nof entry into the profession,\" they say. \"For existing HR professionals,\nanalytics is the minimum expected to be able to have strategic conversations\nabout the impact HR has in the implementation of the business' strategy.\"\n\n![Michael Carty](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2017/01/carty_m-120x120.jpg)\n\n#### About Michael Carty\n\nI'm the editor of XpertHR benchmarking. I'm interested in all aspects of HR\ndata - how it's collated, how it's utilised and interpreted and the stories it\ntells. I'm also interested in the latest information and data on all aspects\nof the work of HR and related disciplines (whether to do with employment or\neconomics) around the world \u2013 and how social media enable HR information and\ndebate to spread and evolve across geographic boundaries. I\u2019ve been part of\nthe XpertHR team since 20 August 2001, working on the site in a wide variety\nof editorial roles as it expanded from its unnamed, pre-launch incarnation to\nthe HR information powerhouse it is today. Further back, I worked as a writer\nat Incomes Data Services (IDS), and before that did time in research and\nwriting roles at a banking consultancy in the City of London and at the Open\nUniversity Business School.\n\n[ View all posts by Michael Carty ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/michaelcarty/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/oh-nurses-around-the-\ntable-at-first-nmc-meeting-to-review-part-3-of-the-register/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/mid-essex-hospital-services-\nnhs-trust-whistleblowing-tribunal/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Essential HR metrics for 2020_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f5a0c28110ffddd4128ec9e12b41b379?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nHUGH BILLOT 19 Dec 2019 at 9:59 am\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/essential-hr-metrics-2020-people-\nanalytics/#comment-79596 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nYou need to get in the real world. These metrics are technical. productivity\nin the UK has hardly improved for a decade and probably because HR uses the\nwrong metrics. HR should be concentrating on such KPIs as profit per employee;\nsales/income per employee; total organisational cost per employee; profit per\n\u00a31 of employment cost, physical output per person hour, just to indicate a few\nmeasures than can really force productivity decisions.\n\nReply\n\n  2. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/61c7e559f0fd6e1990c65759779e0ecd?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\n[Cody](http://www.hranalyticstoday.com/) 23 Dec 2019 at 8:30 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/essential-hr-metrics-2020-people-\nanalytics/#comment-79918 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nThese metrics are valuable because they focus on the employee: recruiting,\nonboarding, training, engagement and all around well-being. If HR is\nsuccessful in these endeavors, then the business is much more likely to be\nsuccessful in profitability measures.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel

To better\nunderstand the surge in new capabilities, Deloitte Consulting LLP's Bersin\u2122\nlaunched a market study. Some interesting capability trends emerged in our\nresearch:\n\n **Nontraditional data sources.** We have spoken to different providers that\nuse e-mail metadata to develop baselines for workplace culture, based on the\nfrequency and flow of communication across teams and networks. Others use\nnatural language processing to draw themes from worker comments on social and\nprofessional networking sites to identify strengths and opportunities. This\ndata can be used to identify workers who are more likely to be successful,\naddress engagement issues while they are still easily manageable or bolster\nthe collaboration of different groups. Additional insights can be derived from\naccessing data from operational business systems, like financial planning\nsystems, customer satisfaction databases, or sales management tools. Our High-\nImpact People Analytics research revealed that high-performing people\nanalytics teams collect data from an average of seven channels, as compared to\nonly three for their low-performing counterparts.\n\n**Advanced data integration.** Various data sources are most valuable when\nthey are integrated with each other, to determine relationships between\nactivities and results. There are quite a few solutions on the market that are\nnow making it easy to combine disparate sources of data. Most providers\ncombine the traditional sources of data (e.g., HR operational data from HCMS\nand ATS), but others are adding nontraditional data sources like assessments,\ncommunication data, social media activities and even customer satisfaction for\na more holistic view of the workforce. For example, by combining data from a\ncandidate relationship management platform and a performance management\nsolution, employees could get feedback on their strengths and development\nareas even before their first day on the job. Another example could be\nfeedback generated from an employee engagement solution combined with\nretention data, providing users with insight into potential reasons why an\nemployee chose to leave even without having to conduct an exit interview.\nThese insights can create actionable triggers for leaders to improve workplace\nculture.\n\n **Smart organization charts.** It has been fascinating to see the growth in\nhow tools can analyze and visualize an organization chart and display much\nmore than who reports to whom. Visualized charts and dashboards make it easier\nto understand priorities such as inclusion and retirement risk. It is one\nthing to see a bar chart of retirement risk, and another to see an org chart\nwith over half the individuals listed as likely to retire in the next five\nyears. These insights can trigger actions like high-potential identification\nand succession management to fill projected gaps.\n\n**User-based metrics and permissions.** Another critical requirement for\npeople analytics is having an actionable approach for different users--from\nthe CEO to the individual contributor. We have seen a collection of intuitive\nmetrics and data visualizations that make it easy for people at the individual\nlevel to take action based on data. For example, proactive notifications that\nremind an individual to take breaks, focus on a specific task or help find a\ngood stopping point for their day.\n\n**Network analytics.** It is exciting to see that network analytics is\nstarting to get broader acceptance as a general tool instead of being\nprimarily used by I/O psychologists. Just over 40 percent of the providers in\nour study indicate that they offer network analytics to understand the\nconnections and connectors in people data, with another 20 percent planning to\nadd the capability in the near future. Beyond an analysis of the inner\nworkings of organizations, we are seeing providers combine their network\nanalysis capabilities with other people data use cases to help achieve\nbusiness outcomes. For example, to determine connectors in organizations for\nchange management purposes, to bolster exposure for women to male leaders, or\nto strengthen integration work during mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWhat does this continued growth of new features and capabilities mean for your\norganization?\n\n  * Solutions are now available to help you understand the workforce experience throughout an employee's life cycle. Determine how the different pieces fit together to build your unique ecosystem of tools and don't wait for the silver bullet of a single solution. Bersin research has indicated that mature organizations manage an ecosystem of tools to generate rich insights and complex actions for business impact, pulling together the right tools for each problem.\n  * If your organization does not have the solutions necessary or the appetite to build these capabilities, focus on the outcomes you are looking to achieve, whether they be retention, engagement or productivity. Evaluate building the capability in-house against using a third-party provider who can do people analytics as a service, supporting your team on a temporary or ongoing basis. \n  * Look for opportunities to drive additional impact beyond HR efficiencies, financial returns or cost reduction. Today, organizations need to be social enterprises, both generating profit and improving the lives of workers, customers and communities as well as solving societal issues. People analytics can provide needed insights into work, workers and the workforce to accomplish this goal.\n\nGiven that high-performing people analytics enable significantly better\nworkforce and business outcomes, the cost of doing nothing might be too high\nto pass up.\n\n _Kathi Enderes, Ph.D., is vice president, Talent and Workforce Research\nLeader, Bersin\u2122, Deloitte Consulting LLP and Matthew Shannon is senior\nresearch analyst, Solution Provider Market, Bersin\u2122, Deloitte Consulting LLP._\n\n _\u00a9 2019.

by\nAlistair Shepherd\") on 29 Jul 2019 in [Evidence-based\nmanagement](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-strategy/evidence-based-\nmanagement/), [People

pressure to produce insights from employee data, but if\nthey 're not clear about where that data comes from and why, they could end up\nalienating staff and cause projects to fail. Alistair Shepherd explains. **\n\nHR analytics \u2013 the collection and analysis of data on employees \u2013 offers a\ngenuine opportunity to understand our workforces better.\n\nIt helps us to see not only trends and sentiment but also get a better\nunderstanding of how work actually gets done and where productivity comes from\nin the messy day to day.\n\n## People analytics\n\n**[People analytics: Good practice manual](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-\npractice-manual/people-\nanalytics/161599/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Which HR metrics will matter in\n2019?](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/commentary-and-analysis/which-hr-metrics-\nwill-matter-\nin-2019/164009/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nThis can make HR more effective than ever at improving the way work gets done\nand, hopefully, gives it a credible role in the business aside from \u201cjust a\ncost function\u201d.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that most HR analytics projects will fail, either because\nthey are too invasive of individual\u2018s privacy or more likely they\u2019re purely\nvoyeuristic exercises and don\u2019t provide a \u201cso what\u201d.\n\nIn both cases the solution to making HR analytics succeed is in being clear\nabout what the aim of the project is, how success will be measured and clearly\ncommunicating the benefit of the exercise to the workforce \u2013 it is their data\nafter all.\n\n## What about privacy?\n\nLet\u2019s start by addressing the privacy concern. The misuse of personal data is\nbecoming a regular headline that means employees are increasingly aware of how\ntheir digital footprints can be used.\n\nMost of the time the use of our personal data by corporations or governments\nis in our interest so we\u2019re amenable to the idea. But occasionally it is used\nto limit our freedoms.\n\nThe South China Morning Post recently reported that over 17 million people in\nChina have been restricted from purchasing a plane ticket because their social\ncredit score (maintained by the Chinese government) is too low.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a model citizen your data can be used to subconsciously\ninfluence your opinions without you even realising it, as demonstrated in 2016\nduring the US election and the UK referendum on Brexit.\n\n## Employee willingness\n\nBecause of these high-profile stories, it becomes easy to see how employees\nmight fear that data held by employers could be used to make decisions about\ncareer progression, development opportunities or even salary.\n\nFearing this, many employees will be reluctant to engage in data collection\nactivities or analytics projects. Since analytics relies on data, HR analytics\noften relies on the willingness of the employee base to be measured or\nmonitored.\n\nThe good news is that a good number of HR departments already understand the\nrisks associated with collecting employee data.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2018 Human Capital Trends Report found that more than 50% of their\nsurvey respondents (senior HR leaders) are \u201cactively managing the risk of\nemployee perceptions of personal data use and a similar proportion is managing\nthe risk of legal liability, yet only a quarter are managing the impact on\ntheir consumer brand\u201d.\n\nThis means that organisations considering broad scale HR analytics projects\nneed to develop a set of well-defined policies, security safeguards,\ntransparency measures and ongoing communication around the use of people data\nor risk employee, customer and societal backlash.\n\n##  People analytics opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more people analytics\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/people-analytics/)\n\nThe second and arguably more common reason that HR analytics projects fail is\nthat they\u2019re voyeuristic exercises with no clear objective or reason to exist\nbeyond just being able to see data. And if there\u2019s no objective, how can we\nsucceed?\n\nIn 2016 Deloitte reported that most (77%) of HR professionals felt that people\nanalytics were important, but only 32% felt ready or somewhat ready to\nimplement them.\n\nThe real question is, important for what? Being \u201cinsight-led\u201d doesn\u2019t count as\na reason. Being \u201cdata driven\u201d shouldn\u2019t be the primary purpose to launch an HR\nanalytics centre of excellence.\n\nThe question should really be, what are our (HR\u2019s) current objectives? What\nbig questions are we trying to answer? Analytics projects shouldn\u2019t be carried\nout for their own purposes, they should be a prerequisite for achieving a\nbigger objective.\n\nOnce you have a clear objective (for example, to understand why some managers\nget high performance out of their team while others don\u2019t) then you need to\nconstruct a hypothesis.\n\nA hypothesis is your guess at the reason(s) behind the phenomenon. Maybe your\nguess is that the high performing managers have regular one-to-ones with their\nteam and the low performing managers don\u2019t.\n\nThe goal of your analytics project should be to collect data that can prove or\ndisprove this hypothesis.\n\n## Business and employee needs\n\nTo be most useful, analytics projects should connect to a business need. Even\nbetter, connect to an employee need.\n\nThen, HR must clearly communicate the benefit to the end user \u2013 in the example\nabove that benefit might be communicated as helping managers develop their\npeople skills. Even better than communicating the benefit to employees, is to\nput them in control of realising that benefit.\n\nGiven that most HR analytics projects will be looking at people problems, very\noften you\u2019ll be looking at changing the way people behave.\n\nSo one of the questions that needs to be answered in order to avoid the voyeur\ntrap is:\n\nIf the data confirms my hypothesis, am I in a position to act on it?\n\nAt Saberr we worked with an international technology firm who were going\nthrough a big change programme after a change in senior leadership.\n\nIt identified that one of the barriers to change was the fact that not all\nmanagers were communicating strategy to their direct reports \u2013 which had a\nknock-on effect of teams lower in the business being unclear on their\nobjectives. Identifying where the issues were enabled managers to get more\nthan 20% improvement in team performance after six months.\n\nGiving employees not just the accountability but also the autonomy to solve\nproblems themselves makes analytics projects far more likely to succeed \u2013 and\nless of a burden for HR.\n\n## Does it really benefit employees?\n\nOf course, not all projects will directly benefit employees. An example of\nthis is one study that suggested a link between commute distance and retention\nwhereby the further you have to commute to work, the more likely you are to\nleave.\n\nActing on this data might mean prioritising recruitment activities in the\nlocal area or offering relocation benefits. Neither of which clearly benefit\nemployees directly.\n\nHowever, the principles of connecting to a business need and clearly and\ntransparently communicating why this data is helpful to the company should\nremain as key principles.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to hear that implementing HR data analytics is a daunting\nprospect.\n\nTo avoid the issues with both privacy and voyeurism the easiest way to ensure\nthe success of your HR analytics project is to clearly define the benefit and\ncommunicate this to all stakeholders involved.\n\nIf the benefit is solely for the HR function \u2013 that is fine \u2013 but employees\nwill engage in the process far more readily if they understand why it\u2019s\nimportant and how it will help improve the company.\n\n![Alistair Shepherd](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/07/alistairshep.jpeg)\n\n#### About Alistair Shepherd\n\nAlistair Shepherd is founder of [Saberr](http://www.saberr.com/)\n\n[ View all posts by Alistair Shepherd ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/alistairshepherd/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/two-thirds-of-employers-\nstruggling-to-find-staff/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/employment-tribunal-waiting-\ntimes-2019/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Why do most HR analytics projects fail?_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7fe996260483c7fad5bebde9e5362255?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAmy Armitage 1 Aug 2019 at 5:50 pm [#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-\ndo-most-hr-analytics-projects-fail/#comment-62112 \"Direct link to this\ncomment\")\n\nExcellent article. I would argue that another reason that projects fail is\nthat they lack a direct tie in to measurable business goals and do not\ndemonstrate (or model) financial and or business impact.

There's an elephant in the\nmiddle of the HR Analytics room, and everyone is looking the other way. There\nis no research stating the abysmal results of the EE/EX wave are because\nleadership believed decades of employee survey data wasn't accurate or\nactionable. Leadership didn't have to take action, they simply ignored the\ndata they didn't like, and HR analytics data will most certainly suffer the\nsame fate.  \nFirst, HR is not positioned to force change on a disinterested leadership.\nThey are victims of the same culture they are being asked to fix, how much\nsense does that make. The data is the least impactful aspect of changing\nEE/EX. The only ways to fix the problem is to have the CEO ask the question,\nHR is on the sidelines and a third party is collecting the responses and\nforcing the blockers before the CEO to justify their resistance versus the\nemployees stated benefits to making the change. It is naive to think\nleadership is altruistic. They resist just like the rest of the humans on the\npayroll. Believing the data makes a bit of difference is ignoring that big\npachyderm standing right in front of you. If the CEO thought HR could impact\nEE/EX to the extent the business would be improved, then every CHRO would have\nEE as a major component of their bonus plan. That's not the case.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/why-do-most-hr-analytics-\nprojects-fail/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/09/judith-grant-mace-635.jpg)Mace Group to\ndiscuss engaging the board via metrics at Employee Benefits\nLive](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/mace-group-to-discuss-engaging-the-\nboard-via-metrics-at-employee-benefits-live/ \"Mace Group to discuss engaging\nthe board via metrics at Employee Benefits Live\")\n\nMace Group's Judith Grant will discuss how HR professionals can engage senior\nleaders with employee wellbeing using metrics and analytics...\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/11/Sage_People_featured___.jpg)Goodbye HR, hello\n\u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/changing-face-of-hr-report-sage-\npeople/ \"Goodbye HR, hello \u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport\")\n\n**PROMOTED |** How far are you in your HR to People journey?

I\u2019ve seen some\ncompanies spend too much time at the onset optimizing their data systems. Data\nintegrity is important, but there needs to be a healthy balance between\nimproving data systems and finding ways to drive immediate value and insights\nfor the broader business.\n\nMy advice for those new to this space is to focus first on gaining a deep\nunderstanding of the people data that you _currently_ have and use this as a\njumping-off point to ask good research questions. Over time you can\niteratively improve on data quality and bring in new data sources, but don\u2019t\nrush to do this immediately.\n\nSecondly, I think many organizations struggle to ask \u201cgood\u201d questions when it\ncomes to workforce analytics. By \u201cgood\u201d I mean posing research questions that\nhave strong business relevance and can be rigorously tested by formulating\nhypotheses and assessing with data. Newer people analytics teams often\nstruggle with effectively tying their research directly to business value. I\nalways tell my team that the business question should drive our research\nprojects, not the other way around.\n\n> **Third, I\u2019ve seen companies struggle to use workforce analytics in a way\n> that keeps pace with the broader business. Long-tailed workforce analytics\n> projects often do not generate insights fast enough for the business. I\u2019ve\n> seen several people analytics teams move to a product design approach where\n> analytics are done in two-week sprint cycles, with business stakeholders\n> providing feedback throughout the process. This allows teams to generate\n> insights quickly and can pivot based on stakeholder feedback.**\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 People Analytics Trends to Watch Out for in\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/3-people-\nanalytics-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019/)\n\n#### **Which are the top three people analytics best practices you wish was\nmore widely followed?**\n\n  \nOne thing that I would like to see adopted more broadly is an emphasis on\nevidence-based decision-making across all of HR. In people analytics, we think\ncarefully about measurement and attribution for every program, policy, or\nprocess we evaluate. To that end, I\u2019d like to see to all teams within HR focus\nmore on:\n\n  * Proactively designing a measurement strategy _prior_ to rolling out a new program or initiative and\n  * When possible, lean into the smaller-scale test and learn pilots to more effectively assess ROI (and possible improvements) prior to making company-wide changes.\n\n  \nSecondly, folks in people analytics tend to do a great job building empathy\nfor stakeholders and working cross-functionally to design and implement\nsolutions. This often requires a deep understanding of how the business works\nand how to connect people data and insights to business metrics. To help build\nthese skills, our team uses an embedded model where each of our analysts does\na rotation in each of our main business functions. This helps ensure that they\nhave the right context to understand and help the business function achieve\ntheir goals/objectives.\n\nFinally, I think the most successful people analytics teams have made\nexperimentation a core feature of their workflow. Designing test and learn\nstudies and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) allows teams to move quickly and\noptimize on the things that work and abandon things that don\u2019t. In my\nexperience, people analytics teams have been at the forefront in driving these\nmethodologies within HR, helping HR become nimbler and more strategic with\nwhere to invest resources.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Is People Analytics the Future of HR Analytics? Q &A; with\nAnkur Modi of StatusToday**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/hr-\nanalytics/ankur-modi-on-future-of-hr-analytics/)\n\n#### **Who is one people leader you follow closely? What\u2019s one of their\nqualities that inspires you the most?**\n\n  \nThere are a ton of smart folks in this space. My former colleague, Ray Yang,\nVP of Talent Analytics at Liberty Mutual, has had a profound impact on my\nprofessional life.\n\n> **For an analytics leader, Ray never got caught up in fanciness of analytics\n> and instead always pushed us to think about the implementation of analytical\n> insights. To this day, his perspective continues to resonate with me and has\n> helped guide our own people analytics team at HubSpot as we scale, and we\n> start to make hard decisions on where to focus our energy.**\n\n#### **Tell us about the best book you\u2019ve read so far on people analytics.**\n\n  \n[_Work Rules!_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875447-work-rules) by\nLaszlo Bock is foundational for anyone interested in people analytics but I\u2019ll\nmention two others that are maybe a bit less familiar. For those interested in\nlearning more about a test and learn mindset, prototyping, and MVPs, I highly\nrecommend [_The Innovator\u2019s\nHypothesis_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22104615-the-innovator-s-\nhypothesis) by Michal Schrage. This book will give you and your team several\nhelpful tools and frameworks for how to leverage analytics in an agile way.\n\nSecondly, if you want a better understanding of the economics of HR, Edward\nLazear\u2019s _Personnel Economics_ is a fantastic resource. This book is a bit\nmore academic in nature but is immensely helpful in providing formal economic\nlogic to many of the core responsibilities of HR (hiring, learning and\ndevelopment, promotions, retention, and more).\n\n**About**[ **HubSpot**](http://www.hubspot.com):\n\nHubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) is a leading growth platform.

Such data can be\nobtained from internal HR systems, employee records/activity, and industry\nbenchmarks.\n\nThe application of data science tools and skills within such HR functions,\nhave led to a new wave of possibilities in people analytics. __The industry\nhas evolved from utilizing basic HR performance analysis to having in-depth\nAI-powered activity benchmarks in many key areas.\n\nWith thanks to research and AI, modern people analytics is significantly less\nbiased than the old school systems, offering a transparent view into the\nworkplace.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Why People Analytics is Key to Strategic HR Decisions: An\nInterview with Khiv Singh of Sapience\nAnalytics**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/hr-analytics/people-\nanalytics-talent-management/)\n\n_**Happy and engaged employees perform better and stick around for longer.\nWhat is the strategic connection between people analytics and business\ngoals?**_\n\nPeople analytics provides unique insights into workplace wellbeing, team\ncollaboration, and customer relationship intelligence to drive organizational\nchange. It allows managers and employees alike to understand company behavior\nand working patterns. By collecting and analyzing metadata of user activity\nexclusively, it ensures complete employee privacy whilst providing full\ntransparency into such related insights. It requires no manual input, like\nsurveys or long meetings and provides insights in real-time.\n\nIncorporating the latest findings in human and organizational psychology,\npeople analytics enables live insights for companies to recognize wellbeing,\nmap collaboration trends, measure engagement, access external relations and\nmap their organizational network in order to reach those business goals. __\n\n_**What are the three most important reasons for HR managers to focus on more\ndata-driven decision making today?**_\n\nFirstly, data-driven decision making with people analytics allows HR Managers\nto pinpoint sources of overwork, thus preventing employee burnout, saving the\ncompany significant costs that are associated with employee turnover.\n\nSecondly, organizations are then more informed and able to provide support\nwhere required, improving overall wellbeing and reducing employee stress.\nConsidering the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ vs\nDeutsche Bank), it has become very clear that the employer holds the\nresponsibility to track and mitigate employee overtime.\n\n> **Using existing company systems, analytics can give real-time insights into\n> each employee and their position within the organizational network.\n> Pinpointing those central individuals within a network is integral to the\n> decision making when allocating workload and responsibilities, thereby,\n> improving the overall workplace environment by reducing stress and\n> overworking.**\n\n_**How can data-driven decision-making help HR teams balance employees\u2019 needs\nvs the business leaders\u2019 vision?**_\n\nTraditional methods of decision making tend to center around engagement\nsurveys, which can be subjective, therefore providing skewed insights. People\nanalytics relies on activity data to provide unbiased insights to eliminate\nguesswork from change management.\n\nPeople analytic tools can often act for both managers and employees to help\norganizations understand collaboration, efficiency and internal overworking.\n__This will enable companies to provide support for employees that are\nstruggling, thus reducing employee burnout and improving overall\nefficiency/productivity.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 People Analytics Trends to Watch Out for in\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/3-people-\nanalytics-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019/)\n\n_**What role does cloud-based HR and benefits platforms play in enabling\nbetter business outcomes from HR?**_\n\nCloud-based HR can be accessed 24/7 by all employees, providing immediate and\nunbiased results that highlight trends in workplace behavior.\n\nAs no manual input is required, this solves what is typically a lengthy\nprocess for customers to input data either directly into a platform or CRM. As\na result, Cloud-based HR helps to remove human errors that occur during this\nmanual process.\n\nTypically, traditional methods would result in such trends taking months to\nidentify and analyze. __For instance, engagement surveys can be highly\nsubjective and do not always give an accurate picture, it relies on activity\ndata to provide unbiased insights to eliminate guesswork from change\nmanagement.\n\n_**How has HR technology \u2013 and especially, AI and Machine Learning \u2013\ntransformed the way senior leaders approach employee wellbeing?**_\n\nFlexible working, 'always-on' email, and the proliferation of communication\ntechnology means that businesses can place a near 24/7 demand on team members.\nThis fosters a relentless pressure to deliver and perpetuates a stressful\nenvironment, that ultimately results in burnout. Machine learning and AI-based\ntools can be configured to be empathetic and understand these interactions,\nregardless of time or location, and can alert each business leader when a team\nmember is overloaded or frequently working outside of typical office hours.\n\n> **By analyzing millions of signals and data points daily, such systems can\n> deliver unique insights that only an AI could. In sharing this information\n> with managers, AI tools can empower them to become leaders within their\n> business for the wellbeing and efficiency of employees.**\n\n_**Distributed workforces are a norm in 2019. How does HR analytics help\norganizations gauge the needs of this workforce?**_\n\nA productive team is a well-connected team, and this all comes down to\ncollaboration. __With teams working closely and well together, the company\nmorale rises naturally. Hence, this results in happier and more productive\nemployees.\n\nHowever, as more organizations offer flexible and remote working, HR analytics\nwill provide real-time insights for managers to spot overworked or underworked\nemployees, as well as bottlenecks or other sources of inefficiency. The\ninformation can be utilized to reduce these inefficiencies and improve\nefficiency and team collaboration, making informed unbiased decisions to\naccommodate the needs of the workforce and ensure clear communication between\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **People Analytics Champions: Companies That Got It\nRight**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/people-\nanalytics-champions-companies-that-got-it-right/)\n\n_**Which new skillsets and mindset changes are needed in the C-Suite and HR\npractitioners both, to embrace digital transformation?**_\n\nC-suite and HR Practitioners need to adopt and embrace key skills in AI and\nData Science. This should be done both at a theoretical level and with\npractical experiments.\n\nAlongside the new skills in AI, leaders need to be ready to share workplace\ndata with their colleagues and allow for greater transparency of such\ninformation within the organization. With greater transparency of data and\ndecision making, modern HR leaders can finally address the growing distrust in\nmanagement. __Finally, they need to be ready to adopt a data-driven decision-\nmaking system, which goes from hypothesis to data validation to decision to a\ndata-driven revalidation for historically intuition driven decision making.\n\n_**What are a few developments at StatusToday you are excited about?**_\n\nAt StatusToday, we recently launched, Isaak, the new Universal Head of HR at\nthe world's fastest-growing employee insights company StatusToday. Isaak is\nthe world's first Artificial Intelligence dedicated to people analytics and\nhas been trained using data collated over the last four years, as a result of\nthe digital footprint employees leave through the course of their day-to-day\nwork. __\n\nRecently, Isaak was recognized as a Gartner Cool Vendor in Digital Dexterity\nand Workplace productivity due to its ability to benchmark and understand\nworkplace relationships, which are then made available to the individual\nemployees.\n\n_**Which HR tech trends in this space are you closely following for 2020?**_\n\nHR is going through a transformational moment.

People data needs to be out in the field and used by managers who\ndaily need to make decisions about their teams:\n\n> The single biggest trend is the value of all this being something that is\n> being used by the supervisor and the employee rather than just HR. More\n> companies are trying to put dashboards in the hands of team leaders, so they\n> can see both the performance and business data - the widget-making or sales\n> - and the people data\n\nNot only would front-line managers have details of sales and operational data,\nbut also training, development, sentiment, engagement and retention and other\npeople data, argues Mallon:\n\n> It gives supervisors a calibrated view of the health of the team, so that\n> day to day they can make better decisions about their team. That is the\n> future of all this [people analytics].\n\nBut for this to happen requires a shift in mindset by HR professionals.\nInstead of looking for systems that only give HR people the data they need to\nhave better conversations with business stakeholders, they must also think\nabout what team leaders throughout the business need. They must decide what\nthey put in the hands of managers or even individual workers themselves that\ncan help them draw their own conclusions.\n\nWhile Mallon is clear that people data needs to be with the masses rather than\nthe few in the HR department, the decision about which solution to choose is\nless clear-cut - analytics buyers are simply spoilt for choice.\n\nThere is a host of pureplay analytics vendors to choose between. Equally,\nthere are many HR platforms, such as talent acquisition or application\ntracking systems, which have analytics capabilities embedded.\n\nThere\u2019s also an explosion of point solutions tackling specific problems, such\nas network or relationship analytics, looking at communication flows,\norganizational network analysis and how you might look at the networks in the\norganizations to improve the business.\n\n## Big deal\n\nPeople analytics is not a single thing. It\u2019s on a spectrum from companies\nsimply reporting to the holy grail of prescriptive analytics and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), says Mallon:\n\n> Vendors in the recruiting world are probably the ones who\u2019ve gone the\n> farthest and fastest at putting both traditional reporting automation\n> technologies as well as more bleeding edge, cognitive, aritificial\n> intelligence and so on into their platforms.\n\nSome vendors are very good about helping companies with this and are not just\npurveyors of technology, but sources of extending the capabilities of your in-\nhouse team. Others take a more DIY approach, handing over the platform and\nleaving it for customers to decide what they do with it.\n\nDecisions about which people analytics platform to buy need to be based not\nonly on the capabilities of the software, but the capabilities and mindset of\nthe managers, he adds:\n\n> You may have a C-suite that\u2019s cutting edge and using data all the time and\n> have middle managers that don\u2019t quite know what to do with it and who make\n> decisions based on experience and relationships.\n\nThe democratization of HR data is part of a wider trend for employees to\nbecome more data driven, says Mallon:\n\n> One of the things we see in our research is this notion of overall data\n> literacy\u2026.Everyone in the HR function and more broadliy everyone in today\u2019s\n> companies shouldn\u2019t be entirely put off by a chart.\n\nData-driven decisions need to take place broadly across the company and not\njust in finance or sales or other pockets of the business.\n\nWhichever flavour of analytics companies choose, it\u2019s essential to have an\noverall data governance strategy:\n\n> You have to have a sense of what data you have, where do you get that data\n> from how do you ensure it\u2019s as clean and up to date and viable as possible.\n\nKeeping on top of data privacy and regulatory considerations of where the data\nresides, who owns it and how it\u2019s being used are key, but most important is\nthe ethics.\n\nMallon suggests thinking of it as a Venn diagram of you could do and things\nyou should do right and looking at where they overlap. New tools will give you\ngreater insights, but you need to think of the implications of that data and\nbe clear about how you are using data to drive impact rather than be driven by\nthe data. Otherwise, observes Mallon:\n\n> You could get yourself in trouble even with the best of intentions.\n\n_Image credit - Bersin_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  * [HCM and the digital future of

Ivanko / Shutterstock\n\n**Barclays has scrapped the use of an employee monitoring platform following a\nbacklash from staff and criticism from privacy professionals and employment\nlawyers.**\n\nSapience, the \u201cmost advanced and automated\u201d people analytics solution\naccording to the US tech company, had been used in a pilot at Barclays\u2019\ninvestment arm in Canary Wharf, London.\n\nThe pursuit of transparency in an organisation can also undermine trust and\nit\u2019s important that employees feel like they can be left to get on with their\njobs without constant monitoring\u201d \u2013 Philip Richardson, Stephensons Solicitors\n\nThe software monitors employees\u2019 activity on their computers and provides\nfeedback on how individuals could improve their productivity.\n\nThe company's website reads: \u201cSapience gives you the power to capture insights\nin a mindful way, providing enlightened analytics that drive productivity\nimprovement and engagement. Managers get work trend data at a macro level, so\nthey can guide their teams more efficiently. Employees can track performance\nand work habits, significantly improving work-life balance.\u201d\n\nIf a Barclays employee is considered not to be \u201cin the zone\u201d, Sapience warns\nthem in a daily update, which tells them if it is recording too many breaks or\ntoo much \u201cunaccounted activity\u201d.\n\nA [whistleblower told City A.M.](https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-barclays-\ninstalls-big-brother-style-spyware-on-employees-computers/) that \u201cthe stress\nthis is causing is beyond belief\u201d and that it \u201cshows an utter disregard for\nemployee wellbeing\u201d.\n\n\u201cEmployees are worried to step away from their desks, have full lunch breaks,\ntake bathroom breaks or even get up for water as we are not aware of the\nrepercussions this might have on our statistics,\u201d they added.\n\nPhilip Richardson, head of employment law at Stephensons Solicitors, said: \u201cAn\nopen and transparent work culture should always be encouraged, however, the\nuse of this technology to track the whereabouts of staff members does seem\nexcessive. The pursuit of transparency in an organisation can also undermine\ntrust and it\u2019s important that employees feel like they can be left to get on\nwith their jobs without constant monitoring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for employees to lodge formal complaints against their\nemployers for excessive and overbearing micromanagement and it will be\ninteresting to see whether the use of this type of technology could bring rise\nto legal claims in the future.\u201d\n\nSilkie Carlo, director of privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch, said:\n\u201cManagers would never get away with breathing down employee's necks,\npersonally monitoring their screens or logging toilet and water breaks.\u201d\n\nShe described the software as \u201ccreepy\u201d and called on the bank to urgently\nreview its use.\n\nA spokesperson for Barclays said it had introduced the software and that it\nwould listen carefully to feedback from the pilot. They told City A.M: \u201cThis\ntype of technology is widely used across the industry to help identify what is\nworking well and opportunities to improve processes. Colleague wellbeing is of\nparamount importance and colleagues are free to take breaks whenever they\nchoose.\u201d\n\nPersonnel Today approached Sapience for comment but had not heard back at the\ntime of publication.\n\n## Employee relations opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more Employee Relations\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/employee-relations/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/national-minimum-wage-\nenforcement-compliance-2018-2019/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/ill-health-costs-\nfirms-38-days-per-employee-in-lost-productivity/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/barclays-abandons-creepy-\npeople-analytics-project/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/shutterstock_113952025.jpg)Talk to the money:\nWhy finance and HR must collaborate\nmore](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/talk-to-the-money-why-finance-and-hr-\nmust-collaborate-more/ \"Talk to the money: Why finance and HR must collaborate\nmore\")\n\nThis HR-finance partnership is hugely valuable to organisations if they can\nget it right.

But in many ways, traditional working models hinder this\nprocess, because they don\u2019t offer on-time insights.\n\nConsider the typical annual review cycle \u2013 performance is assessed every\nyear/biannually. The employee understands problem areas and spends the next\nsix months or year on improvements.\n\nThis means that for actual change to show in the workplace, organizations are\nleft waiting for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nBy adopting a continuous improvement approach in the HR process, you can push\nyour workforce to adapt faster, respond to the need at hand, and reach all new\nheights of productivity.\n\nAnd HR analytics can help you do this efficiently.\n\n**_Learn More:[How to Use Monitoring to Boost Employee\nProductivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-use-\nmonitoring-to-boost-employee-productivity/)_**\n\n## **What Is Continuous Improvement in HR?**\n\nContinuous improvement was popularized back in the 1950s as part of Toyota\u2019s\nmanufacturing strategy. Since then, it has had a pervasive impact on project\nmanagement across industries.\n\nMost recently, startups and agile software development teams have adopted this\napproach to reach their goals faster while minimizing waste of time and\nresources.\n\nAs HR, you can incorporate the principles of continuous improvement to help\nemployees achieve their individual/organizational productivity targets. This\nincludes:\n\n  * Training the workforce to be creative without relying on traditional solutions to solve new problems. \n  * Inculcating an approach to work that aims for long-term success through multiple iterations if required, instead of taking on the pressure to get it right the first time. \n  * Building a data-driven culture where information, insights, and opinions are solicited from a variety of sources for the next work cycle.\n  * Breaking down the idea of \u201cperfection\u201d and focusing on small, ongoing steps towards improvement.   \n\nFor example, as an HR practitioner, you can roll out a standalone L&D; course\nfor a small part of the workforce, test how well this group adopts it, review\nits impact on productivity, and only then decide on further investments.\n\nThrough this approach, employees are pushed to learn more than what is\nimmediately necessary, and organizations save significant amounts of costs and\neffort.\n\nHowever, continuous improvement cannot take place in a vacuum.\n\nThe popularity of this model in the last decade is partly due to the\nwidespread use of project management platforms.\n\nThese platforms show precisely where an employee stands on the improvement\npathway, the effort contributed, and the time remaining to achieve defined\ngoals.\n\nIn HR, you can use people analytics to stay updated on employee progress and\nchannel efforts in the direction most suited for continuous improvement.\n\n**_Learn More:[Why Employee Productivity Analytics is Key to Organizational\nAgility](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/why-employee-\nproductivity-analytics-is-key-to-organizational-agility/)_**\n\n## **Why HR Analytics Aids Continuous Improvement**\n\nAnalytics is now a buzzword in the HR space, and with good reason.\n\nYou can access a vast repository of employee data at a glance. Hours or even\ndays needed to build reports are now taken over by automation. And real-time\nanalytics can help you make decisions when they matter the most.\n\nFor continuous improvement, staying informed of the current scenario at any\npoint in time is at the heart of this concept.\n\nEach iterative cycle \u2013 whether in manufacturing, software development, or HR \u2013\nis based on the results of the last one. The shorter your improvement cycle,\nthe stronger its impact.\n\n[HR analytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\nhr-analytics/) can give you insights immediately at any point in time. In\naddition, [predictive HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/predictive-analytics-in-hr-whats-next-in-2019/) deliver\naccurate projections of \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios.\n\nYou no longer have to analyze historical records to understand future needs\nmanually. Adopting a predictive model helps your framework stay one step\nahead, allowing you to anticipate the factors that may define the course of\nthe next cycle.\n\nFor example, the people analytics solution provider [Viser has a dedicated\npredictive analytics module](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-\nanalytics/visier-introduces-new-models-to-empower-businesses-with-future-\ninsights/) for talent acquisition, helping you to take the right decision on\nyour next hiring campaign based on past results.\n\n## **3 HR Analytics Metrics That Aid Continuous Improvement**\n\nHere are three areas where analytics data can help to introduce continuous\nimprovement in HR.\n\n### 1\\. Scheduling insights to better allocate people assets  \n\n[Workforce scheduling](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/category/workforce-\nscheduling/) is a complex process, dependent on multiple stakeholders, demand\nflux, and company targets.\n\nBy gathering data on which scheduling practices are most effective and how\nemployees would prefer to put in the time, you can maximize your available\npeople assets.\n\nModern task scheduling solutions such as [Shyft\n](https://www.myshyft.com/features/)come with powerful analytics features that\noffer real-time data via business dashboards. This is particularly useful for\nhourly and deskless workers.\n\n### 2\\. Candidate/Talent analytics to improve hiring outcomes  \n\nHiring the best candidate for a position is a key part of HR responsibilities,\nand analytics can help you ensure that each hiring cycle is better than the\nlast.\n\nLook for platforms like [Pulsifi](https://pulsifi.me/), which give you a\ncomprehensive overview of employee-to-role/team/organization alignment, map\ntheir performance, and offer a dynamic picture of how personal traits\ntranslate into productivity.\n\nUsing such data can help you make better hiring decisions in each hiring\ncycle, allowing you to make incremental improvements in every cycle.\n\n### 3\\. Data from chatbots for continuous updates  \n\nConversational interfaces can be a great source of data in real time.\n\nFor example, a chatbot can collect information on multiple team requirements\nand product status to accurately answer employee questions.\n\nIntegrating chatbots into daily workflows will, in turn, ensure that\ncontinuous improvement becomes part of daily workflows, powered by data\ncontinually collected by the bot.\n\nTeleopti offers a solution on these lines called\n[Grant](https://www.teleopti.com/landing-pages/grant) \u2013 a Microsoft AI-based\nchatbot for data-driven employee self-service.\n\nRegular data collection allows you to get a pulse of the organization. This\nmeans you can roll out smaller changes faster. Employees can have their needs\nmet quicker and will remain better engaged at work.\n\n**_Learn More:[How to Get Started with Implementing HR\nAnalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-get-\nstarted-with-implementing-hr-analytics/)_**\n\n## **Integrate Your Ecosystem for Sustained Improvements**\n\nOne of the major barriers to analytics implementation is the siloed nature of\nbusiness processes.\n\nDespite data pouring in from multiple areas, it is difficult to turn this data\ninto actual improvements because there is no single source of truth.\n\nIt is a good idea for HR to start by creating a unified process environment\nwith centralized control and visibility.\n\n[Sapling](https://www.saplinghr.com/) is an HR platform that can connect to\nthe tools and software you are already using for productivity \u2013 it then uses\n[\u201cAI-powered automation and predictive insights\u201d to make every decision more\neffective](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-analytics/sapling-\nreceives-4-mn-in-seed-funding-round-to-build-next-gen-workforce-management-\nsolution/).\n\nAs organizations rethink their processes to succeed in an agile and dynamic\nbusiness environment, the continuous improvement approach will gain more\ntraction in HR.\n\nAnd real-time data, advanced analytics, and smartly designed business\ndashboards can help you link short-term improvements to long-term market\nleadership.\n\n_Are you using analytics for the continuous improvement of your workforce?_\n_Tell us how on_[ _Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

But there are key considerations you can use to\nget started and derive value from your people data.\n\nGetty\n\n**_By David Ludlow, Group Vice President of Product Management, SAP\nSuccessFactors_**\n\n(Part 1 in this series can be read\n[**here**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2019/06/25/how-facebook-\nidentifies-the-benefits-of-data-driven-hr/#2480d2d11ec8).)\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to have the ability to measure the success of HR\nstrategies, better plan for the future, and predict changes in your\norganization? The promise of people analytics is significant but the process\nof implementing and using it can be daunting. There are key considerations you\ncan use to get started and derive value from your people data.\n\nIn part two of this exclusive Q&A with Alexis Fink, Vice President of People\nAnalytics and Workforce Strategy at Facebook, we discuss how businesses can\nsuccessfully practice data-driven HR and implement people analytics.\n\n**David Ludlow: Which departments within an organization are involved in\npeople analytics?**\n\nAlexis Fink: The two most obvious connection points are HR and IT.\nOccasionally, people analytics organizations are nested within larger data\nCenters of Excellence (COE), or sit under a corporate strategy office. Often,\norganizations like finance and sales are connected as teams look at outcomes,\neither as criteria in research projects, or as a way to show the impact of\ninterventions.\n\nThe executive team and other senior leaders are often quite involved in people\nanalytics work as well. Of course, in many organizations nearly everyone will\nbe touched by people analytics work. It touches the entire employee lifecycle,\nfrom the first phase of a candidate\u2019s experience through any job changes or\npromotions, performance review cycles and training, and finally through exit.\n\n**What challenges might organizations face as they get started with people\nanalytics?**\n\nThere are a few challenges. For example, organizations may experience\ninfrastructure roadblocks related to the fundamentals of how data is gathered,\nstored and retrieved. This may seem simple, but for some organizations, it can\nactually be quite difficult.\n\nIf your data is a mess, you can\u2019t just buy an analytical platform and hope for\nthe best. Yes, you\u2019ll end up with numbers, but they will be wrong, and perhaps\ncatastrophically so \u2013 leading you to make flawed decisions. In addition,\norganizations may face problems of capability. Data scientists generally think\nof capability in three big buckets \u2013 content expertise, data expertise and\nanalytical expertise.\n\nI\u2019d also add a fourth category around influencing expertise. The hard part is\nthat you really need all of them \u2013 and it\u2019s rare to find one individual who is\nskilled in all those areas! People analytics really is a team sport. So,\nfiguring out what capability you already have, and then figuring out how to\ncomplement it is the next big challenge. When companies get started with\npeople analytics, it\u2019s critical to have organizational readiness.\n\nIn other words, are people \u2013 especially leaders \u2013 genuinely interested in\nlearning from the data, or only interested in data that proves their point of\nview? You can do brilliant research, and have compelling, intuitive\nvisualizations based on supremely accurate data, but without an organizational\nculture that is willing to bet on data over instinct, you are not likely to\nsee much impact.\n\n**What\u2019s your advice for organizations that need to align disconnected data?**\n\nI think there are two parallel strategies for organizations in this very\ncommon situation. Think of it like building a house. You need to have another\nplace to live while your house is built, and most of your creative and\norganizational energy is probably going to the house.\n\nThe new house is your infrastructure building project, where you are building\nsustainable, reliable methods for bringing the data together. But these\nprojects might take years, and, because they tend to be abstract to many\npeople, it can be quite hard to keep momentum. That\u2019s where your rental house\ncomes in \u2013 the projects where you start using the bits and pieces of data that\nyou do have, or projects where you simply absorb the tax of manually joining\ndata with all the labor intensity and risk that goes with that, or fresh data\nthat you gather.\n\nThis is in part to deliver real business value as quickly as possible. But it\nis also to showcase the possibilities and impact of people analytics work as a\nway of ensuring support for the larger infrastructure work, and, selfishly, to\nalso build capability in your team and your clients.\n\n**For organizations that want to adopt a data-driven HR strategy, how long can\nthey expect the process to be?**\n\nLike so many things, it depends. If all the pieces are there, including good\ninfrastructure, solid capability and a receptive culture, only then is it\npossible to choose a point of entry. For example, you can start with something\nin recruiting and selection, or employee engagement \u2013 and see results pretty\nquickly.\n\nHowever, in practice, it is likely more a process of fits and starts. Some\nareas might be very grounded in data and others may lag a bit behind, due to\nfactors like capacity or the organization\u2019s ability to absorb change. One of\nthe things that makes this work so exciting and fun is that it\u2019s never done.\nWe develop new data streams and new analytical technologies pretty rapidly.\n\nPlus, organizations change pretty quickly, adding locations or lines of\nbusiness in ways that create a need to re-examine existing processes and\nassumptions. So, on the one hand, you could honestly answer, \u201cYou should be\nable to see something materialize in six months or so\u201d and on the other hand,\nthe process is truly infinite.\n\n[![SAP](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_400_213caf45ea19d264d0215f602738fdf9.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/\n\"Photo of SAP\")\n\n[SAP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/)\n\nSAP is the world\u2019s leading provider of business software \u2013 enterprise resource\nplanning, business intelligence, and related applications and services that\nhelp companies\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nSAP is the world\u2019s leading provider of business software \u2013 enterprise resource\nplanning, business intelligence, and related applications and services that\nhelp companies of all sizes and in more than 25 industries run better.

He led the technology functions of Ingersoll Rand, Allied Signal,\nTelstra, and IBM. At Suncorp, he rose above the role, beginning his tenure\nthere as CIO, rising to the role of Chief Executive Officer of Suncorp\nBusiness Services. He assumed that role during the last financial crisis.\nSmith believes part of the reason for his ascent was his appreciation of\nculture, noting, \u201cProduct, strategy and other elements can be copied, but\nculture is hard.\u201d He also believes that the problem solving nature of the CIO\nrole is can create opportunities. \u201cAs a CIO, a key skillset that you learn is\nhow to problem solve. Learning this skill helped me a great deal for my future\nroles,\u201d Smith notes.\n\nAlthough our interview took place prior to the current economic downturn,\nSmith\u2019s rationale for how he helped Suncorp through the last crisis will be\nimportant as he plots the same recovery in his current role as Chief Operating\nOfficer of World Fuel Services, a $40 billion company that provides marketing,\nfinancing, aviation, marine, and ground transportation fuel products and\nservices.\n\nSmith notes that building a better ecosystem, enabled through digital\ntransformation, exposing application programming interfaces (APIs) for other\ncompanies to better interact with World Fuel Services, has set the company on\na better footing. In this interview, Smith offers both \u201cin the weeds\u201d details\nof the digital transformation that he has led together with big picture\nlessons from building great teams, partnerships, and a great culture.\n\nToday In: [CIO Network](https://www.forbes.com/cio-network)\n\n  * [\n\n### Unprecedented?

Could you talk about your purview as\nCOO?\n\n**Jeff Smith:** In terms of operations, we are global. A good chunk of what I\ndo is related to technology because technology has a place from the initial\ncustomer experience, order to cash, procure to pay and record to report. The\npeople, process and technology strategy plays a big piece, and I also have\nresponsibility for the overall financial operations and shared services for\nhow we support our line of business segments when they conduct their business.\nThis involves running the back-office functions more efficiently in the right\nlocations with the right skills. It is the engine that enables us to go out\nand attract business and execute it efficiently.\n\n**High:** Can you talk about the form that digital transformation takes in an\norganization such as yours?\n\n**Smith:** It is quite pervasive because the digital transformation involves\neverything from the CRM systems, the data systems that allow you to ingest\ncustomer and supplier information, portal strategies and self-service.\nFurther, because much of our supply base is third party, it is creating APIs\nand more of an ecosystem to allow different participants to play without\nhaving to make it so complex, build point-to-point integrations or do it\nmanually. That is one piece of the digital transformation.\n\nOn the other hand, it is around efficiency and using robotics, optical\ncharacter recognition and different technologies so that we can hopefully\nbring in every piece of data digitally, process it digitally, analyze it\ndigitally and make more sense out of all the data that we are collecting to\nmake better business decisions. That can be in pricing, and we buy an awful\nlot. We buy and sell $40 billion worth of energy in one way, shape or form. If\nwe take that data and apply some artificial intelligence and machine learning,\ncan we improve our operating margins and improve the experience back to the\ncustomer? It entails everything from the beginning all the way back to how we\nclose the books and do our analytics on the back-end.\n\n**High:** When you joined the organization, how much change was necessary to\nrealize the vision you just described?\n\n**Smith:** There is one aspect I learned through war wounds in my past roles.\nYour strategy and tactics have to manage the talents that you have on the\npitch. If you want to move to the cloud aggressively and use AI and digital\ntechnologies, you have to have the skills to do that. A good chunk of my first\nyear was taking a look from the bottom up, determining the core skills that we\nneeded, how those rolled up in the roles and how we could create an agile\norganization. We did something quite different than what I experienced in my\nlast few jobs. Rather than doing an org strategy top-down, this was about\ngoing from the bottom up. This entails looking at what work needs to be done,\nfinding what skills are needed to do that well and applying more of a Spotify\nmodel of grouping people into small self-directed teams that are loosely\ncoupled yet tightly aligned into tribes and tribes into a domain. This allows\nyou to run a leaner management structure with fewer levels. However, in order\nto do that, you must have the talent to bring that in.\n\nWe went on a strong assessment training, and we brought in new skills. Over\nthe past two years, we have turned over roughly one-third of our workforce. We\nneeded that amount of replenishment to bring the skill base up because there\nis no compression algorithm for experience. We needed to bring people in so\nthat people could learn at an accelerated pace, and we needed to pick the\nright partners. Another key strategy of being ready is that you are only as\ngood as the people you surround yourself with. I have a principle that states\nthat we pick our partners around the company first and the products second\nbecause the company is your leading indicator and the product and the features\nare the lagging indicators. The first year entailed a great deal of effort\naround who we needed at the executive level, the type of practitioners we\nneeded, and the type of special skills, analytics, digital and cloud\ninfrastructure necessary. We needed to replenish to the point that we could\nexecute the strategy that we wanted to.\n\n**High:** As you thought about the people who were the source of these\nreplenishments, how important was experience in the type of work that you\nforesaw as important or more or less important than experience in the\nindustry?\n\n**Smith:** You need experience in the industry, which we had a decent amount\nof, but when it comes to technologies and how to solve problems in different\nways, you need a mesh. In any great organization, you need diversity of\nthought in addition to diversity of gender and race. My experiences tell me\nthat **** attitude is more important than aptitudes, so you need to create the\nright culture. People have a much larger capacity to learn than they give\nthemselves credit for. You have to have the right people to create the right\nenvironment and then set high expectations. The better people will come up to\nspeed more quickly, so you have to have enough congestion of talent and\nleadership just to enable that learning to happen.\n\n**High:** You talked about the need to build a better set of partners. What\nchanges did you make from that perspective?\n\n**Smith:** On the partner side, we had a few business objectives, which I\nbelieve would serve as strong advice for CIOs who want to take on other\nbroader business roles. It is important to look at it in terms of the business\nobjective and the business outcome you want to get. One of the actions we\nneeded to take to connect people across the world in a more effective way was\nto create a strong, productive environment for them so that they could\ncollaborate and learn from each other at a faster pace. We looked to find the\nbest companies in collaboration, and we were going to make hard turns and get\non those companies. We knew that in addition to the products they sold, we\ncould learn different lessons from them. Three companies we use in our what I\ncall the _employee collaboration environment_ are Box, Zoom, and Slack. We use\nBox for content management, Zoom for video and communications, and Slack for\ncollaboration. These are well run companies, and they run similar management\nsystems with OKRs. All three of those companies have helped us outside of just\nusing their technologies and utilizing them for the problems they have solved.\nWe have looked at their leadership techniques, and all three of them are top-\nrated companies to work for. Further, we looked at Box's engineering\npractices, and we sit on its advisory board.\n\nOne of our other key principles is that both parties should benefit outside of\nthe commercial relationship. We had a huge goal to close down our data centers\nand migrate everything to the cloud. We partnered with AWS, and they even\nhelped us recruit at universities. Those four partners have allowed us to get\nmeasurably better at a faster pace. We are relying on good skills internally,\nhiring what is needed, and partnering with the people that are measurably\nbetter than the ones we were replacing.\n\n**High:** Your business is based in Miami, Florida, and you have operations\nall over the place. Can you talk about recruiting to Miami as well as some of\nthese other areas of strategic importance to you? What methods have you used\nto attract the talent you have described as a key to the changes you have been\nspeaking about?\n\n**Smith:** It is difficult because there are two key attributes you have to\nlook for.\n\n1) The job content, which people are immensely interested in, has to be rich\nenough so they can learn and step in.\n\n2) The talent they are going to be surrounded by.\n\nFurther, you have to have the right location so that people are interested in\ngoing there, and you have to pitch the environment. For Miami, we pitch that\nit is a nice environment, there is no state tax, and it has good logistics for\ntraveling globally with international airports. We are moving everything to\nthe cloud and are an agile culture, both of which we use in our pitch. We try\nto sell more of the job content and the environment than the business itself\nbecause we find that is the driver behind the people that are interested in\nmoving. We additionally have a large operation in Costa Rica that has both\ntechnology and back-office operations, and we have locations in London,\nSingapore and other areas around the world. More than anything, in a low\nunemployment environment, people have to be attracted by the job content and\nwho they are going to be around internally and externally.\n\nOur partners have certainly helped with this. As I mentioned, we have had\nrecruiting events at universities that AWS has attended with us. The company\nhas helped us with machine learning and autonomous vehicle races to show the\ntype of work we are doing. Slack has hosted us in New York, and we have done\nthis in Budapest and London. You have to be creative, and in some cases, you\nhave to go to where the talent is and not just use recruiters. We looked at\nthe Northeast as a good place for people that might be interested in moving to\nMiami because of cost and income tax benefits as well as nice weather and\ngreat jobs. It is multifaceted, and it is tough for everyone. If you talk to\nthe tech companies in the West Coast, New York or Austin, it is just as tough\nfor them as well.\n\n**High:** You have been the Chief Information Officer at a variety of major\norganizations, such as Ingersoll Rand, AlliedSignal, Telstra, Suncorp and IBM.\nAt Suncorp, you went from CIO to Chief Executive Officer of Suncorp Business\nServices, a shared services arm of the Australian organization. You are now\nthe COO of a $40 billion energy organization. What was it about your time as a\nCIO that enabled you to rise in a couple of different instances to broader\nsets of responsibilities?\n\n**Smith:** One is the focus on talent. I have gone into different companies\nthat in one way, shape or form needed to make forklift improvements. When you\nare put in tough situations, it forces you to become a better problem solver\nbecause you have to diagnose a big problem, break it into small problems, and\nmulti-process that problem through different teams. At Suncorp, I was the CIO\nwhen the financial crisis hit, and we could not get wholesale funding. When we\nhad these falling off the cliff moments, outside of the technology skills, the\ngreatest skills any leader can have is to bring clarity of purpose to their\nteams and inspire them to do work and solve the problem in a different way or\nmultitude of ways. Your frame of reference has to expand from \u201cTechnology is\ngoing to solve it all\u201d to \"If I get some great people in some smaller teams\nand break this big problem down, I can multi-process it and get it done at a\nfaster pace.\" You then realize that those skills are just as pertinent,\nwhether you are running procurement, finance, HR, or customer service\norganizations. The reality is that culture is the only unique aspect that any\ncompany has. Product, strategy and other elements can be copied, but culture\nis hard. As a CIO, a key skillset that you learn is how to problem solve.\nLearning this skill helped me a great deal for my future roles.\n\n**High:** As you look to the future, what trends particularly excite you?\n\n**Smith:** A great deal of the innovation in new technologies and solutions\nare only natively on the cloud, so your business has to be cloud-native. The\nhybrid cloud is just a transition to get to the ultimate state because the\ninnovation is not being done on-prem. It is absolutely with the cloud players,\nparticularly AWS and Microsoft. We are making an aggressive push to close all\n21 of our data centers, we have closed 10 to date in just over a year, and we\nhave migrated hundreds of applications. You can help lower your costs, you can\nget better performance, you can get data security **** in terms of encrypting\nyour data, and you can build your skills at the same time. It helps your\nemployees, your customers and your business. That is the footprint in order to\ntake advantage of AI, machine learning, and robotics. We are doing an awful\nlot on robotics and machine learning. The skill of machine learning and\napplying it to the right data in the right business problem is going to\nprovide the biggest benefits in the future. Most people have just not used\ntheir data as an asset. It is a necessary evil to conduct your business as\nopposed to your real assets. If companies can understand their analysis and\ndigital skills in that space to be a domain specialist and be able to analyze\ndata and build algorithms and models that can make their business perform\nbetter, they can differentiate themselves in the market.\n\n_Peter High  is President of _ [ _Metis\nStrategy_](http://www.metisstrategy.com/ \"http://www.metisstrategy.com/\")   _,\na  business and IT advisory firm.

David Green 5 minute Read\n\nIf you were writing a book on modern HR, people analytics-the practice of\nusing insights from employee data to support decision-making-would be a\nfoundational chapter. Or likely several of them. The rise of analytics in HR\nand the impact it has on driving organizational strategy means it's now\nessential for best-in-class HR teams.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe perceived complexity around data and analytics makes it feel like a\nbarrier for some HR teams. But it doesn't have to be that way. Everyone\nstarted somewhere-even talent teams at the leading edge of the field now use\npredictive analytics to address turnover before it happens.\n\nIt's more than just data-it's insight. These new analytics capabilities are\nallowing HR teams to extract deep insight into the organizational health of\ntheir businesses, enabling them to be much more proactive with programs and\nsupport.\n\nThis exponential growth in both demand and supply should not be seen as a\nsurprise to anyone following the recent evolution of the field. People\nanalytics offers enormous potential to organizations to drive business\nstrategy, improve performance, and personalize and enhance the employee\nexperience.\n\n## HR gets an analytical track\n\nWhile the adoption of people analytics has been rising steadily for a number\nof years, the rate of growth has surged in the past 18 months. The Corporate\nResearch Forum's 2017 [Strategic Workforce Analytics\nresearch](https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-\nstrategic-workforce-analytics/) found that 69% of organizations with 10,000\nemployees or more now have an entire team devoted to this work.\n\nA recent [study](https://hello.visier.com/age-of-people-analytics-research-\nreport/) by Visier reported that advanced organizations with a high level of\npeople analytics process maturity financially outperform their peers. This\nproven business impact is a good indicator that companies will continue to\ninvest in this practice.\n\nAs the demand increases for people analytics, so do opportunities. There has\nbeen a swell of talent entering the field over the past several years.\nAccording to [a study by\nLinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-\nsolutions/talent-intelligence/workforce/pdfs/NAMER---Rise-of-Analytics-\nReport.pdf), there has been a threefold increase since 2013 in the number of\nHR professionals in North America who list analytics skills in their profiles.\nPeople analytics was also the most in-demand skill HR professionals wanted to\nlearn in 2019, according to the report by myHRfuture on [HR Skills for the\nFuture.](https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report)\n\nadvertisement\n\n##  **People analytics drives business performance**\n\nPeople data is pivotal to helping businesses make critical decisions.\nDetermining where to locate a new office or team? Redesigning your workplace?\nEvaluating whether a merger or acquisition should proceed? People analytics\ncan arm you with the right insights to make better decision in all of these\nareas. Let's look at a few examples:\n\n##  **1\\. Attrition has a cost**\n\nGlobal information, data, and measurement company Nielsen found that for every\n1% decrease in employee attrition, they could avoid $5 million in business\ncosts. The same analysis identified internal mobility as the key driver of\nretention.\n\nAs a result, leadership made it easier for employees to pursue opportunities\nwithin the company and an HR program was created to promote internal mobility.\nThis [program](https://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-\nPerformance/dp/0134546008/) enabled Nielsen to save more than $10 million in\nthe first eight months alone and was subsequently rolled out across the\ncompany.\n\n##  **2\\. Candidate experience is vital**\n\nTelecoms company Virgin Media discovered that in a 12-month period, 7,500\ncustomers cancelled their subscription within four weeks of being part of the\nrecruitment process, as a result of being rejected or having a poor\nexperience. This equated to lost revenue of \u00a34.4 million.\n\nThe company decided to radically [overhaul its candidate experience\njourney](https://hros.co/case-study-upload/hros-case-study-virgin-media-\ncandidate-experience-revenu-stream). It was able to turn the previous \u00a34.4\nmillion loss into an opportunity to create a \u00a35.3 million per year in profit\nby creating new customers based on applicants' positive experiences.\n\n##  **3\\. Engagement affects sales**\n\nUK footwear retailer Clarks found that employee engagement was a leading\nindicator of retail performance, with a 1% improvement in engagement worth an\nadditional 0.4% of improved sales. Further analysis isolated the key drivers\nof engagement as team size in the store and tenure of the store manager.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese insights enabled Clarks to develop a [blueprint for high-performing\nstores](https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-\nstrategic-workforce-analytics/) and HR was able to create a management\ndevelopment program to teach managers how to lead for high engagement.\n\n##  **The future of people analytics**\n\nDespite mounting evidence of the substantial benefits provided by analytics,\nmost companies have barely scratched the surface of what is possible. The good\nnews is that the tide is turning. The field is increasingly attracting new\ntalent, who are introducing new skills such as data science and statistics to\nthe realm of HR. This helps to further progress, as does the advance in\ntechnologies enabling real-time data collection and analysis of unstructured,\nas well as structured, data. Consequently, the growth of these skills is set\nto continue to rise exponentially.\n\nBuilding a people analytics function coupled with capitalizing on technologies\nthat collect, store, and dynamically visualize data enables companies to put\ninformation at the fingertips of the business leaders to support decision-\nmaking.\n\nMoreover, this democratization of data can also help managers by providing\ndata on their own behaviors, as well as providing them with insights that\nsupport employee engagement, development, and performance. For employees,\npeople analytics is increasingly being utilized to provide personalized\nrecommendations that help employees better manage their performance and\ncareers. Think of this as the Netflix recommendation engine applied to people\ndevelopment.\n\nOf course, the quest to make HR a data-driven function is not simple. Common\nchallenges include concerns in areas such as data quality, HR capability and\ncredibility, ethics, and making analytical insights actionable. That said,\npeople analytics is no longer a nice-to-have capability for companies but\nrather an absolute must-have for any HR executive who wants to provide a\npositive impact to the business and its employees and ultimately to build a\n21st-century HR function.\n\n* * *\n\n _ _This post is part of a new Fast Company series on 21st-century human\nresources practices.

HNA maps the interactions between teams and\nindividuals\u2014communication that often occurs outside the lines of the\norganizational chart\u2014to identify who employees work with most frequently, who\nthey turn to for advice, who they consider mentors and more. Using mapping\nsoftware and building on a legacy approach known as organizational network\nanalysis (ONA), the process analyzes network data like e-mail communication,\ncalendar appointments, instant messages, and interaction on internal networks\nlike Slack or Yammer to determine communication patterns, help identify hidden\ninfluencers and position employees where they can have the most impact.\n\nSome call HNA the art of making invisible patterns of strategically important\ncommunication visible. Vendors such as Polinode, Trustsphere, Socilyzer and\nHumanyze offer software that can help companies map these internal connections\n\nHNA also can help gauge changes in internal communication or collaboration\npatterns after major changes like company mergers or a restructuring. \"If\nyou're going through any change management exercise, a carefully constructed\nnetwork analysis can help you determine who now goes to who for answers,\ndirection and support,\" said Jeff Mike, vice president and head of HR research\nfor Bersin, Deloitte Consulting. \"That can help you identify and support\ninfluencers in the new version of the company.\"\n\nSome of these influencers might be previously unrecognized \"boundary spanners\"\nbetween functions like HR and information technology, Mike said. \"They could\nbe leaders, but they might also be technical experts or hold other titles.\"\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Developing and Sustaining High-Performance\nWork Teams_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/developingandsustaininghigh-performanceworkteams.aspx)\n_]_\n\nPower of Relational Analytics\n\nA recent study by Deloitte supports the argument that, despite the hype\nsurrounding people analytics, most such initiatives have only seen modest\nresults. The study found that only 9 percent of companies believe they have a\ngood understanding of which talent dimensions drive performance in their\ncompanies.\n\nSome believe the lackluster results stem from narrow approaches and using data\non individual employees when data about the interaction and relationships\nbetween people\u2014relational analytics\u2014is more important.\n\nCompanies including General Motors, Cisco and Ramco Systems, an enterprise\nsoftware provider based in India, have used relational analytics to spur\ninnovation, improve new-hire onboarding and boost sales performance. GM used\nthe approach to identify employees most likely to work together in ways that\nwould spur creative breakthroughs.\n\nRamco Systems improved the onboarding process of new sales employees. One of\nthe company's biggest challenges is replacing top salespeople, according to an\ninternal study that showed it took three to five months for new salespeople to\nestablish strong relationships with existing clients after replacing their\nseasoned predecessors. Ramco wanted to shorten that time frame and sought to\ndo so by using a network analysis tool to [create a visual map of connections\nof department sales executives](https://www.trustsphere.com/case-studies/).\n\nBy understanding the departing employees' networks at a client company and the\nformer salesperson's strongest relationships, new salespeople were able to\nprioritize where to spend their energy and create a smoother transition from\ndeparting employees to their replacements, reducing their ramp-up time to\nweeks instead of months.\n\nThe technology company Cisco implemented HNA after recognizing a fundamental\nshift in how work was getting done in the organization, said Gianpaolo\nBarozzi, senior HR director at Cisco in Milan, Italy.\n\n\"More and more work gets done today through hybrid human-machine combinations,\nad-hoc collaborations and globally dispersed groups,\" Barozzi said. \"In this\nenvironment, teams have become the fundamental unit and more organizations\nwork like a dynamic collective rather than as a static hierarchy.\"\n\nThat evolution led Cisco to launch an HNA initiative to better connect its\nexisting teams, to identify \"hidden\" teams\u2014those units not visible on an\norganizational chart but that exist as defined by people working together for\nspecific objectives\u2014and to create new teams. \"It gives us a network\nperspective in managing the organization,\" Barozzi said. \"It allows us to see\nhow connected teams are and who is playing critical roles in the network.\"\n\n_Dave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis._  \n\n[Organization and Employee\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and Employee\nDevelopment) [Technology](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Is+Human+Network+Analysis+the+Next+Frontier+in+People+Analytics%3f&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Human-Network-Analysis-People-Analytics.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Technology strategists look at the outdated and manual\nprocesses that still occur across HR and Rewards as the perfect opportunity\nfor automation solutions. At the same time, organizations see the huge cost of\nresourcing and want to find new ways of recruiting and retaining employees,\nbuilding talent pools and maximizing their investments.\n\nWith digital transformation expected to strongly impact all areas of HR from\nthe nature of work, the future skills required for an organization\u2019s\nworkforce, to the delivery of reward, we are at the cusp of significant, even\ntransformative changes. However, understanding how specific digital solutions\naddress the individual requirements of your organization is vital. Even more\nimportant though is the need to ensure you are putting these technology\nsolutions in the hands of HR and reward leaders that can make the most of\nthem.\n\nThis will require a transformation in HR skills that is just as significant as\nany technology investment. Get it right and organizations can expect to not\nonly maximize ROI on the technology but also mould their HR departments into\nones that are strategic business partners responsible for significant impact\non the company\u2019s bottom line, and also with the analytic capability to\nunderstand and make sense of a greater degree of data in the future.\n\n## **The HR Technology Revolution Is Upon Us**\n\nOrganizations are investing more than ever in HR technology as vendors develop\nsolutions that incorporate a range of innovative technologies. In the last\nyear, [organizations have increased their investment in HR technology by\n29%](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/bersin-\nlaunches-the-2019-hr-technology-market-report-heres-what-you-need-to-know/),\nresulting in the HR technology market growing by 10%.\n\nA range of trends are emerging, including the shift from engagement to\nproductivity in core systems, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the\nsignificance of gig workforce management.\n\nUnilever\u2019s use of AI is just one example of the change that is occurring. As a\nbusiness, it recruits more than 30,000 people a year and processes around 1.8\nmillion job applications. This obviously takes a lot of time and effort, so\nUnilever made use of AI in an online platform that enabled candidates to be\nassessed at home in front of a computer or mobile screen.\n\nWith the candidates asked to perform a series of tests, machine learning\nalgorithms then assessed their suitability for different roles, resulting in\n70,000 hours of interviews and assessments being saved from HR employees\u2019\ntime.\n\nApart from AI, another key area of innovation in this sector is HR analytics,\nwhich relates to the area of productivity. This emerging trend is a\nmethodology for creating insights on how investments in human capital assets\ncontribute to the success of an organization. This is done by applying\nstatistical methods to integrated HR, talent management, financial and\noperational data.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Human Resource Development (HRD)? Definition,\nFunctions, and Best Practices for Training\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nhuman-resource-development/)**\n\n## **Tech Solutions Without Data Skills Are Pointless**\n\nWhile these solutions and the results they produce will sound very tempting to\nChief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), companies should tread carefully in\ntheir vendor selection process.\n\nThe most important first step is to identify what the company really needs,\nrather than be sold the benefits of a particular technology. Practitioner-led\nsolutions, which have been built and are maintained by professionals with real\nHR industry experience, are usually the best option for organizations that\ndon\u2019t fully understand which solution fits their needs.\n\nThis consultative approach shouldn\u2019t end with sales and onboarding either. The\nbest practitioners will understand the importance of upskilling HR teams to\nmake the most of the new technology that should become a fundamental part of\nan HR employee\u2019s job.\n\n[Recent research from the CIPD](https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/people-\nanalytics-report_tcm18-43755.pdf) on people analytics shows how important this\nupskilling will be. At present, only half (54%) of companies think their HR\nteam has demonstrable numerical and statistical skills. In addition, only 40%\nthink those teams are able to tackle organization issues using analytics data.\n\nData science skills will play an increasingly important role within\norganizations that invest in the new wave of HR technologies, as these\norganizations look to make the most of their investments. That means having\nintellectually curious people who can interrogate and interpret the data,\ndeciphering where it has come from, what it tells them and what the anomalies\nare.\n\nOnce the skills are in place within the HR team, the next area ripe for\ndistribution is rewards. So much of HR analysis is linked to productivity,\nattraction, motivation, and retention which are all linked too, and very\ndependent on the reward. Yet, the traditional reward model of fixed structures\nand pay ranges within an organization does not easily lend itself to the\nadaptability and flexibility the future \u2018digital workforce\u2019 will require.\n\nThe absence of any system capable of consolidating and analyzing global reward\ndata, on a granular, employee-level, is a data gap that needs to be resolved,\nespecially for global organizations that require consistency in rewards across\nfunctions and countries.\n\nWorking with Unilever for seven years to build such a system to consolidate\nand analyze global reward data has made the reward more engaging and relevant\nfor employees. Unilever are now able to experiment with the data to truly\nunderstand what motivates their employees which will lead to greater employee\nretention and address a number of other workplace requirements, that soon will\nbecome mandatory for organizations like the gender pay gap, diversity\nreporting and more.\n\n## **Data-Driven HR Will Power Organization Transformation**\n\nThe benefits of this upskilling will not be limited to making the most of new\ntechnology either. By introducing data science as a core skill within HR\ndepartments, organizations can change their employees from people managers to\nbusiness strategists.\n\nThe HR professionals of the future will be advising organizations on\neverything from pay ratio adjustments and cost-effective locations to\nborderless workforces. This will be possible because they are able to act on\nthe data at their fingertips, developing interpretable models and explainable\nanalytical results that win over the confidence of key decision-makers.\n\nThis type of technology transformation within HR departments may seem like\nit's a long way off for some organizations, and achieving this change alone\ncould feel like a major success. However, once that first milestone has been\npassed, it cannot be a one-off event.\n\n**Learn More:[Automation Technology Makes Human Resources More\n\u2018Human\u2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/automation-technology-makes-human-resources-more-human/)**\n\nThe technology skills of today are attainable for anyone wanting to transform\ntheir career but these skills are also finite in their relevance. In fact, the\nhalf-life of a technology skill is thought to be just two years. Therefore\nindividuals will need to constantly refresh the ones they have, even if they\nhave only just been learned.\n\nThis will result in a bigger emphasis on relevant skills as opposed to years\nof experience when deciding how valuable an employee is, particularly as the\nopen marketplace for global talent expands. While such changes will affect all\naspects of work, HR departments that are able to change their practices now,\nmolding themselves into data-driven, skills-based teams, will be able to lead\nthis change across organizations.\n\n**Learn More:[Understanding the Essence of HR Digital\nTransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/understanding-the-essence-of-hr-digital-transformation/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+Professionals+Of+The+Future+Will+Be+Data+Scientists+First\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+Professionals+Of+The+Future+Will+Be+Data+Scientists+First&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR Professionals Of The Future Will Be Data\nScientists\nFirst&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

There are many milestones in the evolution of\nHR tech, but many HR experts consider 2012 as the mark of a generational shift\nin technology and a new league of application in the HR tech industry. This is\nmainly attributed to the introduction of SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, and\ncloud), according to HR Technologist.\n\nIn this new decade, new (and not-so-new) tech trends are about to disrupt the\nHR sector like never before. HR and people experts around the world revealed\nsome of the trends to watch for:\n\n**1\\. Going beyond functionality to add value to employees**\n\nThe right HR tech doesn't just automate tasks for employees but also enables\nthem to contribute fully and maximize their potential as unique individuals.\nApproaches should move toward liberating and empowering people - and HR\ntechnology should support this change. The HR sector can also expect to see a\nshift toward managing teams, groups, and networks - rather than just\nindividuals. HR systems, therefore, should focus much more on a group's value,\naccording to Jon Ingham, author of \"The Social Organization\" book.\n\n**2\\. Organizational guidance systems**\n\nThe time has come to create an organization guidance system that business and\nHR leaders can use to provide course-correcting and enable more effective\norganizations. It moves beyond scorecards, dashboards, and predictive\nanalytics into an integrated guidance system that enables more effective\norganizations and business decision-making.\n\nExisting data collection overwhelms business leaders who struggle to sort out\nwhich ideas to use. An organizational guidance system, however, articulates\ndesired business, customer, and investor outcomes and then offers guidance to\nattain them, said Dave Ulrich, Rensis Likert professor at the Ross School of\nBusiness, University of Michigan.\n\n**3\\. AI-filled recruitment market**\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nRecruitment is now the biggest AI market in HR, with AI-based sourcing,\nassessment, screening, interviewing, and candidate experience management now\navailable. Like the rest of HR, recruiting teams have to be systems\nintegrators.\n\nAlso, many recruitment vendors are drifting into internal talent mobility,\ncareer management, and other adjacent areas. It's because the recruitment\nmarket is crowded, and many of these vendors have useful HR technology for\ninternal mobility. Thanks to the ever-tightening labor force, this internal\nrecruitment market is now bigger than ever, according to analyst Josh Bersin.\n\n**4\\. Health and well-being market explosion**\n\nThe $48-billion corporate well-being market is perhaps the most fragmented and\nexplosive of all. Tools for mental and emotional health, stress reduction,\nphysical fitness, diet, and financial well-being are everywhere.\n\nMost big healthcare providers are injecting money into new AI-based automated\ntools, and these can be mixed and matched to fit any workforce in the world.\nWell-being platforms can bring these apps together and create real behavior\nchange for your workforce. Thus, HR and people teams should understand what's\navailable, as these are critical issues for employment and company brands,\nsaid Bersin.\n\n**5\\. Remote or virtual workspace technologies**\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of flexible working, there's still plenty of\nroom for the sector to grow. There are already several solutions to address\nthe challenges that remote workforces present for organizations - from\ncollaborative workspaces to virtual office spaces. However, the sector is\nstill in its infancy, and we're still to see a race for businesses to develop\nsolutions to a growing contingent of remote workers, according to Emily Fritz,\nemployer brand specialist at Exaqueo.\n\n**6\\. Addressing notification and device fatigue**\n\nThe average person checks their phone every 12 minutes and receives about 64\nphone notifications a day. With screen-time under scrutiny for its negative\neffect on our health, we will see more technologies adjust to address the\nhealth and wellness concerns centered on device fatigue.\n\nThis increasing level of awareness will also extend to notifications. Pointing\nto Instagram's decision to remove likes from people's posts, Fritz said that\ntechnology would follow suit by becoming more economical with the number and\ntype of notifications they show.\n\n**7\\. Career coaching technology**\n\nAs the development of workplace technology continues to gather pace,\norganizations will need to provide a higher level of coaching technology to\nemployees.\n\nUp until now, employees are expected to seek these resources on their own and\nspend their money outside the company. However, the mindset is shifting thanks\nto millennials, according to J.T. O'Donnell, CEO of Work It Daily.\n\n**8\\. Increased usage of people analytics for actionable insights**\n\nThe continued use of people analytics remains a top HR technology trend. HR\nand people leaders will need to advance the use and maturity of analytics even\nfurther, such as by running experiments and making an impact on business\nstrategies and bottom-line growth.\n\nHR leaders should develop how to ask questions and run experiments across the\norganization before deciding on a certain course of action - becoming\nevidence-based instead of instinct-based - said Gautam Ghosh, HR influencer,\nspeaker, and writer.\n\nMeanwhile, Sage People's \"The changing face of HR\" research report revealed\nthat only 42% of organizations are currently using data to drive HR decision-\nmaking, which means that there's still a lot more to do.\n\n**9\\. Increased employee experience-driven initiatives**\n\nThe focus on employee experience intensifies and doesn't seem to show any\nsigns of slowing down. It was raised by many experts, including people\nanalytics leader Soumyasanto Sen, who said that the demand has already started\non the consumerization front of HR customers.\n\nFor instance, AI will continually be used to build better employee experience.\nWhile AI is taking over, employers finally realize that they must put people\nfirst. Pool tables and open-concept seating is not where to put employee\nexperience; getting feedback from the people you're trying to show\nappreciation to might help, according to Jazmine Wilkes, HR generalist at SEA\nWire and Cable.\n\n**10\\. HR and people teams as tech and process tsars**\n\nDigital tools can, by reviewing the current ways of working, likely force a\nreview of unproductive and wasteful internal processes, according to Perry\nTimms, founder of People and Transformational HR. As a result, HR and people\nteams are ideally placed to introduce leaner, more agile and responsive\nprocesses that are in tune with what people and the organization need - as\nprocess tsars in organizations.\n\n### Related stories\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for

My aim was to dig into companies and leaders who embrace a more\ncontemporary approach to human resources. What are they doing that's\ndifferent? How has the leadership profile changed? Is it making a difference?\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nI interviewed more than 30 people leaders around the world for the series and\n[podcast, which I called 21st Century HR](https://21stcenturyhr.com). These\nwere some of the key shifts that differentiate today's HR from legacy\napproaches, and what they mean in 2020:\n\n##  **Inclusion over diversity**\n\nHR has long been focused on the idea of diversity, but these efforts were\noften transactional at best. At worst, they were driven by compliance and\nlargely centered around hiring. \"We need X of Y demographic in our recruiting\npipeline.\" This approach missed the mark and minimized progress.\n\nModern people teams are more focused on inclusion. They understand the\n[bias](https://www.fastcompany.com/90358626/culture-fit-vs-culture-add)\nembedded in terms such as \"culture fit\" and strive to embed inclusive thinking\nand practices throughout their people programs--recruiting, pay equity,\npromotions, training, development. They've moved their approach from\ntransactional programs to embedded practices.\n\n##  **Decentralize and empower over command and control**\n\nLegacy-oriented HR fixated on getting the proverbial seat at the table. To\ngain perceived power, they created command and control structures where HR was\nthe conduit through which approvals flowed. Promotions. Bonuses. Policies. In\nmany cases, this came from a place of insecurity. While it created authority,\nit wasn't without a cost. Resentment swelled at the complex machinations that\nslowed decisions and frustrated employees.\n\nModern HR leaders (and teams) are more secure in the impact they have on the\nbusiness. They see their role as creating frameworks and\n[enablement](https://www.fastcompany.com/90264760/the-best-hr-is-\ninvisible?partner=rss&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss?cid=search)\nprograms that allow leaders to lead and employees to thrive. They don't feel a\nneed to insert themselves into every program and initiative for the sake of\npower and authority.\n\n##  **Agile reviews over annual reviews **\n\nThe annual review cycle has long been seen as HR dogma. It's [a relic of the\npast](https://www.fastcompany.com/90260641/the-complicated-and-troubled-\nhistory-of-the-annual-performance-review) with [no clear\ncorrelation](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190501-why-appraisals-are-\npointless-for-most-people) to employee performance. It's based on a construct\nof long-term employment that no longer exists for many employees. Most\ncompanies treat reviews as little more than a \"check the box\" administrative\nendeavor, feeding the bureaucratic legacy perception of HR.\n\nadvertisement\n\nModern people teams don't run programs for the sake of programs. Their\nprograms need to be anchored in impact to the business. They also understand\nthat a culture of feedback and clarity drives engagement and retention. These\nHR teams are [reimagining](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/our-journey-\nto-reimagine-performance-reviews-at-surveymonkey/) performance management and\nadopting more agile approaches. The frequency varies--quarterly, monthly, even\nweekly--but the impact is increased clarity and communication.\n\n##  **Analytics and insights over metrics and reporting **\n\nHR has always had data. But it's the way teams interpret and extract insights\nfrom that data that separates legacy and modern HR teams.\n\nPeople analytics is a foundational capability of modern HR. Sixty-nine percent\nof large organizations now have\n[dedicated](https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-\nstrategic-workforce-analytics/) people analytics teams. Leading CHRO's (chief\nhuman resources officers) and chief people officers build agile people\nstrategies based on qualitative and quantitive data. [Data is\nessential](https://www.fastcompany.com/90357244/this-is-why-data-is-now-more-\nessential-than-ever-in-hr) to their operations.\n\n##  **Policy for the many over policy against the few **\n\nLegacy HR approaches are often rooted in compliance. They look at the worst-\ncase scenario of employee behavior and apply the remedy to all employees to\nsafeguard the business.\n\nModern HR leaders aren't shirking their compliance responsibilities, but their\ndefault assumption is that they've hired adults with reasonable judgment who\ncan make good choices. \"If it's not illegal or stupid, it's our job to say\n'yes,'\" Credit Karma chief people officer Colleen McCreary told me on the\npodcast recently. This mentality illustrates the shift in thinking on HR's\nrole in supporting the business. If an employee does something wrong, they\naddress that individually.\n\n##  **Open source over black box**\n\nOne of the single biggest shifts that's fueling next-generation HR practices\nis the shift to [open-source\npractices](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067090/why-hr-needs-to-go-open-\nsource?cid=search). Legacy HR viewed their processes as secret ingredients\nunder lock and key. This proprietary approach stifled innovation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nModern HR teams embrace open-source approaches. You'll often find HR leaders\nspeaking or writing about their work, sharing case studies on their operation\n(including their failures), and sharing openly in networks such as [PeopleTech\nPartners](https://peopletechpartners.com/).\n\nThere's a range of free resources from [Google\nre:Work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/) to [HR Open Source](https://hros.co)\nfull of templates, tools, frameworks, and resources on modern HR practices.\nThis open access to practices and resources is accelerating the shift to\nmodern HR and fueling the next generation of HR leaders.\n\n##  **Business acumen over HR acumen**\n\nEmployment law? Table stakes. Succession planning? A given. Talent mapping?\nFundamental. HR has always had HR acumen. In today's complex business world,\nthat's not enough.\n\nLook across HR leadership in sector-leading companies and you'll HR leaders\nfrom a range of nontraditional career paths. Why? The complexity of business\ntoday requires an HR leader to possess an intimate grasp of the business,\nindustry, market, and more.\n\nThe chief people officer is one of the toughest jobs in the c-suite. They're\nexpected to understand the financials like a CFO. Grasp product-market fit\nlike a CMO. Gauge the revenue pipeline like a CRO. Be the right hand to the\nCEO. All while synthesizing that understanding to develop programs and systems\nthat optimize your most volatile resource: your people. It's a difficult job\neven with business acumen--and it's impossible without it.\n\n## ' **Why isn 't HR here?' over 'Why is HR here?'**\n\nThe key takeaway from these discussions? HR is a spectrum. While the majority\nof the field is somewhere in the middle, the leading edge of HR is having a\ntransformational impact on business. Though still a subset of the broader HR\npopulation, modern people teams are indispensable success enablers for the\nbusiness. Their impact on the business is magnitudes above their legacy\npredecessors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n#### About the author\n\nLars Schmidt is the founder of [Amplify](https://amplifytalent.com/), an HR\nexecutive search and consulting firm that helps companies like Hootsuite, NPR,\nand SpaceX navigate the future of work.

While\n95% of talent professionals in India believe employee experience will shape\nthe future of HR in the coming years.\n\nThe report which looks at survey results from 7,000 talent professionals,\nplatform data, and interviews with leaders to provide insight into the key\ntopics impacting HR leaders today focuses on how empathy is reshaping the way\nemployers hire and retain talent, with companies working harder than ever to\nunderstand their employees more deeply, and better serve them.\n\nThe four key trends highlighted by the report are:\n\n**Employee Experience** : Talent professionals say focusing on EX increases\nretention and productivity, meets high expectations of younger workers and\nattracts more candidates in this tight labor market. Top areas under employee\nexperience that need fixing however are compensation and benefits and an\nincreasing need for simplified administrative processes. In India, 95% of\ntalent professionals in India consider employee experience to shape the future\nof HR while 44% of Indian respondents feel that lack of leadership\u2019s focus and\nprioritization is a significant barrier to improving a company's employee\nexperience.\n\n**People Analytics** : Meaningful insights will inform talent decisions at\nevery level of the recruiting cycle, and therefore understanding and\ncapitalizing on analytics is quickly becoming a must-have skill in HR. In\nIndia, 92% of talent professionals in India say people analytics will be very\nimportant in shaping the future of HR and recruiting (world average is 85%;\nSoutheast Asia (90%) and China (89%)). Meanwhile, 72% of talent professionals\nin India currently use people analytics for measuring and improving\nperformance in HR operations.\n\n![trends](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1579863306/trends-to-watch-\nin-2020_dsmxvm.png)\n\n**Internal Recruiting** : Organizations are rediscovering how cost-effective\nit is to recruit their own people. Workplace learning is also helping to build\nskills internally so there\u2019s less need to import them from elsewhere. Top ways\ninternal candidates are recruited are through jobs on internal job board and\nhiring managers reaching out to employees they know.

The key word, I\nthought, was _potential_. Not anymore. A recent global survey on which I\ncollaborated with Oracle suggests that HR is right up there with the most\nanalytical functions in business \u2014 and even a bit ahead of a quantitatively-\noriented function like Finance. Many HR departments are making use of advanced\nanalytical methods like predictive and prescriptive models, and even\nartificial intelligence.\n\nThis is a big change from a decade ago, when I began to study the use of\ntalent analytics. (Jeanne Harris, Jeremy Shapiro, and I published an [article\nin HBR](/2010/10/competing-on-talent-analytics) on the subject in 2010). At\nthat time, the only really sophisticated HR analytics capability we uncovered\nwas at Google and perhaps Harrah\u2019s (now Caesars). There was a fair amount of\nreporting going on, but not much prediction. Few HR organizations even had a\ndedicated analytics person. \u201cHR analytics\u201d typically meant a debate about how\nmany employees the organization had, or the best way to measure employee\nengagement.\n\nEven before the new survey results came out, I suspected that things were very\ndifferent today. Most large companies have at least a small people, talent,\nworkforce, or HR analytics group. There are many conferences devoted to the\ntopic. It\u2019s very common for organizations today to model workforce growth,\nattrition, engagement, and other key variables.\n\nThe survey involved 1,510 respondents from 23 countries across five\ncontinents. It included senior managers, directors, and VPs from from HR\n(61%), the Finance function (28%), and general management (10%). I was hired\nto help design, analyze, and report on the survey. All of the executives were\nfrom companies with $100M in revenue or more. Detailed results are\n[here](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/hr-analytics-report-ipaper.pdf).\n\nWhile it\u2019s obvious that HR is moving in an analytical direction,  I did not\nexpect the very high level of sophisticated analytical activity in the survey.\nHere are some highlights:\n\n  * 51% of HR respondents said that they could perform predictive or prescriptive analytics, whereas only 37% of Finance respondents could undertake these more advanced forms of analytics.\n  * 89% agreed or agreed strongly that \u201cMy HR function is highly skilled at using data to determine future workforce plans currently (e.g. talent needed),\u201d and only 1% disagreed.\n  * 94% agreed that \u201cWe are able to predict the likelihood of turnover in critical roles with a high degree of confidence currently.\u201d\n  * 94% also agreed that, \u201cWe have accurate, real-time insight into our employees\u2019 career development goals currently.\u201d\n  * When asked \u201cWhich of the following analytics are you using?\u201d \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d received the highest response, with 31%. When asked for further detail on how respondents were using AI, the most common responses were \u201cidentifying at-risk talent through attrition modeling,\u201d \u201cpredicting high-performing recruits,\u201d and \u201csourcing best-fit candidates with resume analysis.\u201d\n\nThis level of self-assessed capability for HR analytics was high in almost\nevery geography and every specific question, but it was somewhat lower in\nAsian, European, and Australian organizations. It was generally highest in the\nU.S., the Middle East, and Latin America. Across industries, it was lowest in\nthe \u201chospitality, travel, and leisure\u201d and \u201cmedia and entertainment\u201d\ncategories. Particularly high industries included financial services, energy\nand utilities, professional services, and wholesale distribution.\n\nWhy is HR more comfortable with advanced analytics than Finance, which has\nalways been a function based on numbers? I have noted for years that Finance\norganizations and the CFOs who lead them have found it difficult to move past\ndescriptive analytics and reporting \u2014 which they do very well \u2014 to more\nadvanced analytics. There are certainly exceptions to this rule, but it helps\nexplain why the growth of advanced analytics has been faster in HR.\n\nBut no function in a business stands alone with regard to data and analytics.\nOne reason that Oracle surveyed both HR and Finance executives is that those\ntwo functions have an increasing need to collaborate. Workforce expenditures\nare often among an organization\u2019s highest costs, and a company\u2019s financial\nsituation will dictate fluctuations in the size and makeup of the workforce.\nThe survey found high levels of collaboration and mutual respect between HR\nand Finance, and a growing need for collaboration. For example, 82% of\nrespondents agreed or strongly agreed, and only 5% disagreed, that\n\u201cIntegrating HR and Finance data is a top priority for us this year.\u201d However,\nseveral interviews conducted after the survey revealed that there is still\nmuch opportunity for greater sharing of data and collaboration on analytics.\n\nOf course, not everything is rosy in the world of HR analytics. I was quite\ninterested to see that the function\u2019s use of analytical tools surpasses the\nability to interpret and act on them. When respondents were asked about the\narea of \u201cmost needed to develop or improve\u201d analytical skills for HR, the\nhighest-ranking choice was \u201cacting on data and analytics to solve issues.\u201d\n\u201cCultivating quantitative analysis and reasoning skills\u201d and \u201cadvising\nbusiness leaders by telling a story with data\u201d also ranked highly.

HR\nfunction](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/people_analytics_5bf523cb378c9.jpg)\n\n_**How are successful HR leaders approaching the use of analytics to optimize\ntheir workforce and create real business value? Perla Sierra, the Sr. Director\nof Data Analytics Information Management at Assurant tells us more.**_\n\n**What have been the 3 biggest challenges your team faced when you were\ninvesting in, driving adoption or attempting to optimize business outcomes\nfrom People Analytics?**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBefore embarking on a true analytical journey, **the quality of the data**\nmust be assessed, **consistent metrics** must be agreed to, and **privacy\nsafeguards** must be implemented. While data is usually never perfect, we must\nstrive to obtain the highest possible level of data integrity and when there\nare data gaps, then the analytics practitioner must understand the data\nopportunities and take it into account in any analytical exercise.\n\nEven though data about people has been available for a long time, the\n**transition of people analytics from a hunch and feel to a more structured\napproach** has been one of the biggest challenges. The challenge around using\ndata-driven decision-making approach towards people is that it is important to\ncompare employees and performance using an even playing field and this is very\ndifficult to do. To do this, we must always adjust for context. **Adjusting\nfor context** involves consideration of factors which may not be present in\nthe data or if it is it may not be obvious.\n\nAs an example, when comparing performance for similar or same jobs, other\nfactors outside of the data should be considered such as environmental factors\n(i.e. working conditions, manager, etc.).\n\n**Making data-driven decisions within the People Analytics space may fuel\ntensions because people prefer human judgment over algorithmic judgment**. The\ntruth is data-driven decision-making removes bias if the playing field is even\nand of course if the data is accurate. Making decisions based on data will\nundoubtedly increase the analytical maturity of the organization and serve to\nengrain a more unbiased approach to decision making while also strengthening\nthe organization\u2019s culture. The availability of data offers new innovations\nand new insights.\n\n**What would your top 2-3 most practical tips to HR leaders who want to\nsuccessfully build, scale, and optimize their people analytics function? What\nshould they prioritize?**\n\n**Availability of quality data, data security, and data privacy should be at\nthe forefront of implementing a people analytics function.** Without these 3\nkey elements, it will be more difficult to be successful in building and\nscaling a successful people analytics function. Sometimes not all the data may\nbe perfect or accurate. In this case, the organization should consider a\nphased approach that could leverage the data that is accurate or at least good\nenough to start the analytics journey rather than waiting for all the data to\nbe accurate.\n\nUnfortunately, a phased approach will take longer and may cost more in terms\non incremental costs, however, you should consider the intangible opportunity\ncosts that would be missed if you simply choose to not move forward until you\nhave the entire scope of the data. This is a case of you must get comfortable\nwith the uncomfortable and push through with \u201cgood enough\u201d data. I would\nconsider the best practice to create data councils and data stewards which\ncould drive data standardization and quality and push for data governance.\n\n**What would be the 2-3 key milestones in an organization\u2019s People Analytics\nMaturity journey?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the end in mind. The end goal is for the business to embed\npeople analytics in business decisions. How can we best accomplish this\nendeavor? The **data** must be reliable, secure, safeguarded, consistent,\nhowever, it does not have to be perfect. The HR partner must identify **people\nproblems** that impact the business that could be identified earlier in the\nprocess or even eliminated altogether ideally. The **HR Partner and the\nBusiness Partners must work collaboratively** to look for opportunities to\nderive insights and provide the actionable insights to the right audience at\nthe right time and ultimately whenever possible provide prescriptive and\npredictive analytics. The HR team must work with business leaders, frontline\nmanagers, customers, vendors, and others to identify opportunities, spread\nawareness, form deep partnerships, and advance organizational maturity.\n\n**Some examples of how HR can increase its own analytical maturity while also\nincreasing that of the business would be by providing the following** :\nmonitoring of employee retention, training, internal mobility, skill set\nassessment, correlating hiring assessment to performance metrics,\nidentification of future resource needs.  \n\n**What approach has worked for you when it comes to building a data-driven\nculture in your HR organization?**\n\nThe most effective technique I have come across when building a data-driven\nculture is to **create business partnerships with different internal\nbusinesses, departments, analytical practitioners, and even external\nsources**. It is the diversity of the people and experiences that everyone\nbrings to the table that really offers the most in terms of creative problem\nsolving and innovation. Everyone sees an opportunity through a different lens\nand this integration creates strong collaborative models that benefit the\norganization. By adopting a culture of diversification and integrating\nthinking partners that can offer constructive arguments, daring to disagree,\nand being prepared to change your mind you are truly moving the organization\nto the highest level of not only collaboration, buy-in, and acceptance but you\nare increasing analytical maturity across the entire organization. Openness is\nthe beginning of something truly great. As the collaboration and communication\ncontinues, the players strive to complete each other rather than compete and\nthen this is when the trust starts to come into the data-driven culture and\nhere is when things really start to feel right and growth surges.\n\n**What are the 2-3 big trends in the people analytics and workforce\nperformance space that you are personally tracking as we head into 2020 and\nbeyond?**\n\nJust like consumers, employees would also like tailored solutions for them\ninstead of a one size fits all approach.\n\n**Machine learning** techniques provide the organization with the ability to\ntailor personalized experiences for employees in all areas from talent\nacquisition to internal mobility, learning, team building, and other areas to\nincrease employee engagement. Machine learning may be used to not only\npersonalize experiences but also offer optimal team integration, and internal\nmobility opportunities with optimal positive outcomes based on data available\nthrough personality tests, social networks, surveys, or other means to create\nan explosive HR transformation that will increase employee engagement and\nreduce turnover. Of course, the ideas could also be directed towards\ncontractors which would also offer a big return on the investment.\n\nEmployees and contractors would like the same personalized experiences that\nare provided to customers and this should not surprise us as customers,\nemployees, and contractors are all people. I would expect to see an\n**increased focus on correlating employee engagement with productivity levels\nand business results.**\n\n**_Want to hear more from Perla and other Executives from AIG, Taboola,\nWebster Bank, Marriott, Panasonic, and GE, among others?

This includes cloud computing solutions,\nhub technologies, artificial intelligence, people analytics, process\nautomation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics. How\nindividuals interact with technology, along with the new tools at our\ndisposal, is changing how we work. HR can\u2019t sit idly by; it must help drive\nthe transformation. Yet making sense of the implications for HR is no simple\ntask.\n\nWalking the floor at the 2019 HR Tech Conference and Expo, we overheard some\nconsistent themes from HR professionals in attendance. The overwhelming number\nof vendors and point solutions meant more, not less, uncertainty when it comes\nto determining where they should invest. Many struggled to find value in the\nhuman capital management systems already in place; there were questions about\nwhat solution would work best given their circumstances, and who within the\norganization was making the decisions. In many instances, it seemed that the\nentire process of deciding on the right technology was in the hands of IT,\nrather than HR.\n\nConference attendees express a consistent need to do a better job of taking\nthe multitude of disparate, inflexible platforms that make up current HR\nservice delivery and find ways to tie these together to create a more\ncompelling employee experience and to make it easier for HR teams to integrate\nplatforms so they can be more productive. It\u2019s about simplifying the complex.\nThis need for a consistent employee experience \u2013 every touchpoint between HR\nprograms and the individual employee - aligned with the employer\u2019s distinct\nEmployee Value Proposition, seemed to be the Holy Grail of the conference\nexperience.\n\nSo how can organizations make sense of this bewildering technological market?\nI believe the answer is to focus on the three most useful and promising\ntechnologies that HR can use to make smarter decisions faster.\n\n### **Hub Technologies: Centering the experience around the individual**\n\n  \nTo keep the \u201chuman\u201d in HR, technology should focus on helping individuals make\ninformed decisions about the rewards and development programs available to\nthem.\n\nOrganizations clearly want the best talent possible to deliver on their\nmission. When done right, that mission is tied directly to its unique employee\nvalue proposition (EVP). There\u2019s no such thing as a cookie-cutter approach for\ndeveloping an EVP \u2013 every organization must differentiate its strategy based\non its unique brand and a sense of purpose. Likewise, there\u2019s no such thing as\na \u201cbest practice\u201d for adopting HR technologies relevant to specific\norganizations.\n\nNo two employers have the same talent goals, so the right ecosystem for one\norganization may not be right for the next. A global software developer has\nvery different HR needs from a mid-sized Midwestern manufacturer. While there\nare plenty of behind-the-scenes processes and transactions that are similar\nfor both, the need to entice and motivate talent requires a very organization-\nspecific mix of employee-facing technologies.\n\nAlong with creating a unique EVP, there are millions of distinct employee\nexpectations. The best employee experience is designed for every individual we\nserve, which demands that we treat each one uniquely, using communication\nchannels, content, tone, and data aligned with each person\u2019s expectations.\n\nHuman-centered design, the process of building out the full user (in this\ncase, employee) experience based on the people you\u2019re designing for, and\nending with interactions that are tailor-made to suit their needs, helps to\nachieve this audience-of-one focus. A generic approach can be valuable for\ntop-down communication, but not much else. Even persona-driven models that\nhelp narrow the ideal experience still run the risk of being overly\nstereotyped. Personalized models assure individual data, including past\ninteractions, is used to create a meaningful employee experience with the\nright messaging and tone, delivered via the right channel.\n\nContextual experience \u2013 serving up the right content at the right time -\nprovides the added benefit of drawing only on _relevant_ work and life events\nfor a hyper-personalized approach. The more contextual, and therefore more\nvaluable to the individual, the more likely the communication will deliver the\ndesired results, for both the employee and the organization.\n\nThe advent of hub technologies, coupled with tailored employer branding and\nback-end analytics, helps both employers and employees stay the course for\nimproved performance and better outcomes for all. As artificial intelligence\nsystems \u201clearn\u201d more about the individual\u2019s preferences (through machine\nlearning), the technology adapts to the personal preferences of the individual\nregardless of the systems running in the background. This is where companies\ncan best adapt their vendor selection strategy: keeping the employee\nexperience relevant while maintaining consistent process flow and metrics.\n\n### **People Analytics: Improving people and business performance**\n\n  \nPeople analytics is now the lifeblood of HR\u2019s role in workforce planning.\nMeasuring and analyzing this slice of \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014data on performance,\ncompensation, demographics, career history, benefits, employee behaviors, time\nutilization, and attrition\u2014can help identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, address recruitment and retention challenges,\ncapture ROI from HR initiatives, and uncover leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nPeople analytics is also collapsing the narrow siloes of talent, benefits,\nwellness, or population health, bringing them all together to intersect and\nimpact the employee experience and benefit the individual.\n\n### **Predictive Analytics: The power of insight**\n\n  \nClosely aligned with people, analytics is the power of looking into the\nfuture: predictive analytics. Workforce data gives HR and business leaders the\nability to make evidence-based decisions to address and improve turnover\ntrends, retain high performers, forecast talent needs, and even anticipate\nlegal risks with poor performers. More the predictive analytics guide the\norganization in selecting and developing its talent, rewards, and HR programs,\nthe better the results for both the company and the individual.\n\nOrganizations that took our [Global Wellbeing\nSurvey](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__content.buck.com_working-2Dwell-2Dglobal-2Dsurvey-2Dof-2Dworkforce-2Dstrategies&d=DwMFaQ&c=9wxE0DgWbPxd1HCzjwN8Eaww1\n--ViDajIU4RXCxgSXE&r=tLT_yNhQo0KunNn7QxL-\nOmi122ic3DN53x7UXHir3Vg&m=jWz9vjRygNrctxedb3c5-_EVz5UZmFQNYTS3WV4A61E&s=eR0oM0adZcs8DigTmnH8fkFVNXRdkQ5wb3oOqQMTjsM&e=)\nreleased earlier this year rated the effectiveness of predictive analytics at\nan incredible 84%. But given the high cost of this investment, it\u2019s critical\nthat HR and IT work together to include a number of scenarios across the full\nrange of business needs, not just predicting isolated hiring and development\nneeds.\n\n### **Cutting through the noise**\n\n  \nThere are many HR technologies and services on the market. It\u2019s critical never\nto lose sight of the goal: technology should be able to help companies \u2013 and\ntheir employees \u2013 make smarter decisions, faster. Administrative platforms\nrunning behind the scenes should have as their goal improving business\ndecisions and corporate outcomes. Employee-facing systems need to support the\nways people actually use their benefits, track progress in meeting their\ncareer goals, and engage with the ways the company bolsters the employee\nexperience across the health, wealth, and career spectrum.\n\n**Learn More:[20 HR Metrics You Need to Track in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/important-hr-\nmetrics/)**\n\nBut there\u2019s never an off-the-rack approach when it comes to engaging with\nemployees, and HR leaders need to evaluate their infrastructure and unique\nchallenges continuously. Each organization has distinct needs that, once\nclearly identified, should point to the technology that will best address\nthose needs.\n\nMany of the conference attendees we met embraced the model of pulling the\nentire HR tech landscape together for the organization, through the powerful\nanalytics tools we\u2019ve been talking about. They hold on to the dream that\npeople and business decisions can be made with all relevant data aggregated.\nThat speaks to the need for HR to take the lead in helping IT see the value of\nfull people data analysis.\n\nAligning the personal needs of employees with the business needs of the\norganization \u2013 the social contract \u2013 is indispensable to achieving success for\nboth workers and employers. For HR in the throes of figuring out the best\ntechnology to use, it\u2019s the only strategy that will pay off.\n\n**Learn More:[7 Sentiment Analysis Tools to Improve Employee Engagement in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/sentiment-\nanalytics-tools-features-price/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Making Sense of HR Tech in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

And yet,\nprogress in HR analytics has been glacially slow. To improve this sorry\nrecord, organizations should be attuned to factors that can effectively \"push\"\nHR measures and analysis to audiences, as well as factors that can effectively\nlead others to \"pull\" that data for analysis throughout the organization.\n\"Push\" factors include articulating the connections between talent and\nstrategic success, and using appropriate tools and techniques to transform\ndata into rigorous and relevant insights. Making sure the data is high quality\nand using the right communication channels will also motivate decision-makers\nto act upon these insights. When managers trust the data and understand how it\nconnects to the bigger picture, it creates a sense of \"pull\" -- they're more\nmotivated to act.\n\n![jun17-16-hbr-vincent-tsui-analytics-\ndata-02](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/06/jun17-16-hbr-vincent-tsui-\nanalytics-data-02.jpg) Vincent Tsui for HBR\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2017/06/hr-must-make-people-analytics-more-user-\nfriendly?language=es)\n\nManaging HR-related data is critical to any organization\u2019s success. And yet\nprogress in HR analytics has been glacially slow. Consulting firms [in the\nU.S.](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/human-\ncapital/hc-trends-2015.pdf) and\n[Europe](http://ny.workforceanalyticssummit.com/the-state-of-workforce-\nanalytics-research-report/) lament the slow progress. But a [Harvard Business\nReview analytics study of 230\nexecutives](/resources/pdfs/comm/visier/18765_HBR_Visier_Report_July2014.pdf)\nsuggests a stunning rate of anticipated progress: 15% said they use\n\u201c[predictive analytics](http://www.visier.com/tech-insights/do-predictive-\nworkforce-analytics-actually-work/) based on HR data and data from other\nsources within or outside the organization,\u201d while 48% predicted they would be\ndoing so in two years. The reality seems less impressive, as a [global IBM\nsurvey](https://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/study/studies/ceo-study/) of\nmore than 1,700 CEOs found that 71% identified human capital as a key source\nof competitive advantage, yet a [global study by Tata Consultancy\nServices](http://www.tcs.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Trends_Study/TCS-Big-\nData-Global-Trend-Study-2013.pdf) showed that only 5% of big-data investments\nwere in human resources.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [Putting Data to Work](/insight-center/putting-data-to-work)\n\nSponsored by Accenture\n\nAnalytics are critical to companies\u2019 performance.\n\nRecently, my colleague Wayne Cascio and I took up the question of why HR\nanalytics progress has been so slow despite many decades of research and\npractical tool building, an exponential increase in available HR data, and\nconsistent evidence that improved HR and talent management leads to stronger\norganizational performance. Our\n[article](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOEPP-03-2017-0021) in\nthe Journal of Organizational Effectiveness: People and Performance discusses\nfactors that can effectively \u201cpush\u201d HR measures and analysis to audiences in a\nmore impactful way, as well as factors that can effectively lead others to\n\u201cpull\u201d that data for analysis throughout the organization.\n\nOn the \u201cpush\u201d side, HR leaders can do a better job of presenting human capital\nmetrics to the rest of the organization using the LAMP framework:\n\n  * **Logic.**  Articulate the connections between talent and strategic success, as well as the principles and conditions that predict individual and organizational behaviors. For example, beyond providing numbers that describe trends in the demographic makeup of a job, improved logic might describe how demographic diversity affects innovation, or it might depict the pipeline of talent movement to show what bottlenecks most affect career progress.\n  * **Analytics.** Use appropriate tools and techniques to transform data into rigorous and relevant insights \u2014 statistical analysis, research design, etc. For example, understanding whether employee engagement causes higher work performance requires analysis beyond correlations that show the association, to be certain that the reason is not simply that better performers become more engaged.\n  * **Measures.**  Create accurate and verified numbers and indices calculated from data systems to serve as input to the analytics, to avoid having \u201cgarbage in\u201d compromise even with appropriate and sophisticated analysis.\n  * **Process.** Use the right communication channels, timing, and techniques to motivate decision makers to act on data insights. For example, reports about employee engagement are often delivered as soon as the analysis is completed, but they become more impactful if they\u2019re delivered during business planning sessions and if they show the relationship between engagement and specific focus outcomes like innovation, cost, or speed.\n\nWayne and I observed that HR\u2019s attention typically has been focused on\nsophisticated analytics and creating more-accurate and complete measures. Even\nthe most sophisticated and accurate analysis must avoid being lost in the\nshuffle by being embedded in a logical framework that is understandable and\nrelevant to decision makers (such as showing the analogy between employee\nengagement and customer engagement), or by communicating it in a way that\nengages them through stories, [analogies](http://www.visier.com/hr-\nleadership/its-like-harnessing-analogies-to-accelerate-\nhr/?utm_campaign=b9216rr&utm_medium=b&utm_source=rr), and familiar examples.\nMy colleague Ed Lawler and I compared the results of surveys of more than 100\nU.S. HR leaders in [2013](http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=24277) and 2016\nand found that HR departments that use all of the LAMP elements play a\nstronger strategic role in their organizations. Balancing these four push\nfactors creates a higher probability that HR\u2019s analytic messaging will reach\nthe right decision makers.\n\nOn the pull side, Wayne and I suggested that HR and other organizational\nleaders consider the necessary conditions for HR metrics and analytics\ninformation to get through to the pivotal audience of decision makers and\ninfluencers, who must:\n\n  * receive the analytics at the right time and in the right context\n  * attend to the analytics and believe that the analytics have value and that they are capable of using them\n  * believe the analytics results are credible and likely to represent their \u201creal world\u201d\n  * perceive that the impact of the analytics will be large and compelling enough to justify their time and attention\n  * understand that the analytics have specific implications for improving their own decisions and actions\n\nAchieving improvement on these five push factors requires that HR leaders help\ndecision makers understand the difference between analytics that are focused\non compliance versus HR departmental efficiency, versus HR services, versus\nthe impact of people on the business, versus the quality of non-HR leaders\u2019\ndecisions and behaviors. Each of these has very different implications for the\nanalytics users. Yet most HR systems, scorecards, and reports fail to make\nthese distinctions, leaving users to navigate an often confusing and strange\nmetrics landscape. Achieving better \u201cpush\u201d means that HR leaders and their\nconstituents must pay greater attention to the way users interpret the\ninformation they receive. For example, reporting comparative employee\nretention and engagement levels across business units will naturally draw\nattention to those units where retention or engagement is lowest, middle, and\nhighest (often depicted as red-yellow-green), and a decision to emphasize\nimproving the \u201cred\u201d units. However, turnover and engagement do not affect all\nunits the same way, and it may be that the most impactful decision would be to\nmake a green unit \u201ceven greener.\u201d Yet we know very little about whether users\nfail to act on HR analytics because they don\u2019t believe the results, because\nthey don\u2019t see the implications as important, because they don\u2019t know _how_ to\nact on the results, or some combination of all three. There is virtually no\nresearch on these questions, and very few organizations actually conduct the\nsort of user \u201cfocus groups\u201d needed to answer these questions.\n\nA good case in point is whether HR systems actually educate business leaders\nabout the quality of their human capital decisions. We asked this question in\nthe Lawler-Boudreau survey and consistently found that HR leaders rate this\noutcome of their HR and analytics systems lowest (about 2.5 on a 5-point\nscale). Yet higher ratings on this item are consistently associated with a\nstronger HR role in strategy, greater HR functional effectiveness, and higher\norganizational performance. Educating leaders about the quality of their human\ncapital decisions emerges as one of the most potent improvement opportunities\nin every survey we have conducted over the past 10 years.\n\nTo put HR data, measures, and analytics to work more effectively requires a\nmore \u201cuser-focused\u201d perspective. HR needs to pay more attention to the product\nfeatures that successfully push the analytics messages forward and to the pull\nfactors that cause pivotal users to demand, understand, and use those\nanalytics. Just as virtually every website, application, and online product is\nconstantly tweaked in response to data about user attention and actions, HR\nmetrics and analytics should be improved by applying analytics tools to the\nuser experience itself.

As Managing Director of The People Analytics Program at Insight222, he\nhelps global organizations create more cultural and economic value through the\nwise and ethical use of people data and analytics.\n\nDavid has extensive experience in helping organizations embark upon and\naccelerate their people analytics journeys. In an exclusive interaction with\nPeople Matters, David, who will also be speaking at TechHR 2019, shares his\nviews on how can organizations leverage people analytics to achieve positive\nbusiness and employee outcomes.\n\n### What are some of the key trends in people analytics making waves globally?\n\nThe rise in interest levels, adoption, and importance of people analytics\nsince I first entered the field six years ago is staggering. During this time,\nI have seen people analytics move from the periphery towards the center of HR,\nwhere the practice is now a core component of workforce strategy, digital\ntransformation, and efforts to improve the employee experience.\n\nResearch studies on people analytics consistently highlight the growth of the\nspace. For example, the Corporate Research Forum\u2019s 2017 [Strategic Workforce\nAnalytics](https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-\nstrategic-workforce-analytics/) research found that 69% of large organizations\nnow have a people analytics team. Consequently, a swell of talent has entered\nthe field, with [a study by\nLinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-\nsolutions/cx/2018/pdf/full-report.pdf) finding that there has been a 70%\nincrease in the Asia Pacific region alone for specialized analytics\nprofessionals in HR in the five years to 2018. Perhaps not surprisingly,\npeople analytics was also the most in-demand skill HR professionals wanted to\nlearn in 2019, according to research we conducted at myHRfuture on [HR Skills\nfor the Future](https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report).\n\nGiven that there is increasing evidence that people analytics can radically\nimprove a company\u2019s bottom line, we can expect to see continued growth in the\ncoming years.\n\n### What are some of the key questions people analytics (and HR) leaders\nshould be asking themselves to ensure they\u2019re on the right path for business\nimpact and differentiated employee experience?\n\nIn the [Nine Dimensions for People Analytics](https://www.insight222.com/nine-\ndimensions) model I developed with Jonathan Ferrar as part of our work at\nInsight222, we identified seven key questions that HR leaders should ask\nthemselves to check they are on the right path to being successful with people\nanalytics.\n\n1\\. Do you have an Ethics Code of Conduct for People Analytics?\n\n2\\. Are your People Analytics projects selected and prioritized using proper\ngovernance and criteria?\n\n3\\. Do your senior business executives sponsor People Analytics projects?\n\n4\\. Does your Chief Human Resources Officer invest in People Analytics?\n\n5\\. Does your People Analytics Leader have the skills to \u201cget things done\u201d?\n\n6\\. Do you measure the ROI of your People Analytics projects?\n\n7\\. Are your HR Business Partners capable of having evidence-based\ndiscussions?\n\nI\u2019ll be diving into the detail of these seven questions during my [Masterclass\nat TechHR 2019](https://india.techhrconference.com/workshops) in a few weeks,\nand if you want to receive an immediate high-level assessment of your\norganization\u2019s people analytics, you can take the Seven Question Survey.\n\n### What are some of the business challenges that could potentially be solved\nthrough the insights offered by people analytics?\n\nPeople analytics offers tremendous potential to organizations to drive\nbusiness strategy, improve productivity and performance, and personalize and\nenhance the employee experience.\n\nFor example, Nielsen found that for every 1-percent decrease of attrition,\nthey could avoid $5 Mn in business costs. The same analysis identified\ninternal mobility as the key driver of retention. As a result, leadership made\nit easier for employees to pursue opportunities within the company and an HR\nprogram was created to promote internal mobility. This program enabled Nielsen\nto save more than $10 Mn in the first eight months alone, increase the number\nof lateral moves, and was subsequently rolled out across the company.\n\nThis is just one example of a business challenge that can be solved by people\nanalytics. FIG 1 below illustrates examples of other business challenges I\nhave seen companies solve using people analytics.\n\n![david green](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1562925090/FIG_1_People-Analytics_Use-\nCases_David-Green_yllmuw.png)\n\n_FIG 1: Examples of the business and people outcomes of people analytics\nprojects (Source: David Green)_\n\n### How can organizations leverage people analytics to achieve positive\nbusiness and employee outcomes as well as improve the impact of HR?\n\nWhen Jonathan and I developed the aforementioned Nine Dimensions for\nExcellence in People Analytics model, we identified the factors required for\norganizations to create more impact and value \u2013 for the business, for\nemployees and for HR \u2013 from their work.\n\nIn summary, these nine dimensions, grouped into three core areas: Foundation,\nResources and Value are:\n\nPeople Analytics needs a strong foundation in order to be impactful:\n\n  * Strong governance, data standards, and ethics\n  * Robust methodologies and prioritization \u2013 \u2018start with the business problem, not the data\u2019\n  * Supportive stakeholders and business sponsors \n\nThe right resources need to be in place in order for people analytics to\ndeliver outcomes:\n\n  * Balanced and skilled team\n  * Effective technology\n  * High-quality HR and business data\n\nImpactful people analytics creates value at numerous levels:\n\n  * Workforce experiences for employees, managers, and leaders\n  * Business outcomes for executives\n  * A data-driven culture and increased impact for HR\n\nI\u2019ll be going into detail on this model and how organizations can create more\nimpact with people analytics during my [Workshop at\nTechHR](https://india.techhrconference.com/workshops) on 3rd August.\n\n### What are some of the opportunities offered by people analytics whilst\nnavigating the challenges of digital transformation?\n\nWe hear a lot of talk \u2013 and frankly a lot of hype \u2013 about the future of work\nand the use of AI in HR.\n\n> \u201cOne opportunity that I am seeing more companies actively pursuing though\n> revolves around the topic of personalization \u2013 giving employees \u2018consumer-\n> like\u2019 experiences at work.\u201d\n\nWhere I see this working best is where HR works directly with employees to co-\ncreate HR programs that drive personalization in areas such as onboarding,\nlearning and career paths within an organization. This involves a radical and\nmuch-welcomed shift from the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 HR programs of the past and\nis not only better for employees, but also supports initiatives such as better\nworkforce planning and increased employee engagement and retention for\nbusinesses.\n\nNone of this is possible without data and analytics. How can you personalize\nlearning and career paths for employees without data? You can\u2019t. This is\nperhaps the best indicator of why the companies that are further forward with\ndigital HR transformation are also those that are more advanced with people\nanalytics. Digital and analytics go hand-in-hand.\n\n_Don\u2019t miss out the opportunity to engage in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with David Green at\nTechHR 2019 on 1st and 2nd August 2019 at The Leela Ambience,\nGurugram.[Register\nnow](https://india.techhrconference.com/?se=DavidGreen&cp=Interview&ag=Content)._\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Analytics](/category/hr-technology/hr-\nanalytics?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-analytics \"Browse more in: HR\nAnalytics\"),\n[#TechHRIn](/tag/techhrin?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=techhrin \"Browse\nmore in: TechHRIn\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

analytics\n\nEmployers that gather and analyze data on their employees can boost\nengagement, improve productivity and deliver better benefits.\n\nBy: [Chris

positive. That\u2019s good news for workers and\neconomic growth, but less so for employers who often struggle to hire and\nretain top talent in such a tight market.\n\nMore bad news for employers? We\u2019re seeing the death of the job-for-life\nmentality. Gallup\n[reports](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-\ngeneration.aspx) that 21% of millennials say they\u2019ve changed jobs within the\npast year\u2014more than three times the number of non-millennials who report the\nsame. With millennials now the largest generation in the U.S. labor force, it\nlooks like workforce transience is here to stay.\n\nTo tackle these labor market trends, top companies are turning to people\nanalytics. Through gathering and analyzing data on their employees\u2014on how\nengaged they are, which benefits they\u2019re using and which they value\nmost\u2014employers can create a more accurate picture of their people, and deliver\nan employee proposition specifically designed to meet their needs.\n\nAs understanding of the value of people analytics improves, we\u2019re seeing more\norganizations build this capability within their teams. Our recent research at\n[Thomsons Online Benefits](https://www.thomsons.com/) found that in just three\nyears, the number of global organizations building people analytics teams\n[rose](https://www.thomsons.com/press-releases/organizations-upskill-hr-teams-\nto-unlock-power-of-people-data/) to 68% from 15%. In the U.S. alone, 21% of\norganizations have had a dedicated people analytics team for more than a year,\nwhile 17% have had one in place for more than three years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, over 85% of global employers surveyed currently use, or plan to\nuse, employee data to report on business operations and performance\u2014and the\nreason for this is clear. Early adopters are already enjoying significant\nadvantages. Almost two-thirds (64%) have used people insights to improve\nemployee engagement, while nearly half (47%) have improved employee\nproductivity.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Using analytics to keep employees happy and engaged**\n\nHappier people stay longer at their company and this boosts its bottom line.\nCompanies on Fortune\u2019s _100 Best Companies to Work For_ list have stock prices\nthat [rose](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2012/07/30/make-more-\nmoney-by-making-your-employees-happy/#49399f275266) an average of 14% per year\nfrom 1998-2005, compared to 6% for the overall market.\n\nSo, how can HR leaders use data insight to effect?\n\nOne area they should look at first is reward. While salary will always be a\nsignificant factor as to whether workers stay or go, employee benefits are\nplaying an increasing role in current and prospective employees\u2019 perception of\nan organization. According to our research, 84% of employees feel that their\nbenefits [impact](https://www.thomsons.com/resources/infographics/how-to-\nguide-how-to-promote-happiness-through-benefits/) their feelings of loyalty\ntoward their employer and their positivity at work.\n\n**Related:**[5 reasons to attend HRE\u2019s Health & Benefits Leadership\nConference](https://hrexecutive.com/5-reasons-to-attend-hres-health-benefits-\nleadership-conference/)\n\nIncreasingly, top HR leaders are turning to data analytics to improve their\nbenefits strategy by looking at which benefits their people are engaging with.\nFor instance, if an organization has implemented a new wellbeing app for\nemployees, they can analyze login data to see if employees are using the app\nand whether they find it useful. They could then look at absenteeism levels,\nor even check their insurance claims, to gauge whether it is yielding results.\nOur research found that organizations that use employee data to report on\ndifferent aspects of the business have higher employee engagement scores than\nthose that don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Use analytics for supporting business objectives**\n\nBut data isn\u2019t just a way to find out what employees value\u2014it\u2019s also an\nincredibly important tool for HR leaders to prove the effectiveness of their\nstrategy in supporting business objectives. For example, if a business wants\nto improve its productivity, HR leaders may want to [improve the wellbeing of\ntheir people](https://hrexecutive.com/why-the-shift-toward-employee-wellbeing-\nmatters/) and invest in a wellbeing program. They can then map take-up of this\nagainst fewer sick days, lower insurance premiums and business productivity to\nprove that this investment has delivered return.\n\nIn a tight labor market, it doesn\u2019t necessarily take matching the [unique,\nquirky benefits](https://hrexecutive.com/is-breast-milk-shipping-the-next-big-\nbenefit/) of large companies such as Google\u2019s nap pods or Johnson & Johnson\u2019s\nfree concierge service for companies to compete. Instead, companies should\nfocus on achieving better benefits for employees by creating targeted reward\nprograms that meet their needs.\n\n**Related:** [Is breast-milk shipping the next big\nbenefit?](https://hrexecutive.com/is-breast-milk-shipping-the-next-big-\nbenefit/)\n\nBy using data to achieve this, employers can be far more strategic. They won\u2019t\nend up offering gimmicky benefits that might look cool but offer no real\nvalue. Instead, organizations will be able to offer benefits that have proven\nvalue to employees and support business objectives.\n\nChris Bruce is founder and CEO of Thomsons Online Benefits.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-increase-retention-in-a-tight-labor-market-through-people-analytics%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+increase+retention+in+a+tight+labor+market+through+people+analytics&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-increase-retention-in-a-tight-labor-market-through-people-\nanalytics%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-increase-retention-in-a-tight-labor-market-through-people-analytics%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.
