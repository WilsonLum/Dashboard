These new-age HRTech tools are now helping enterprises hire, train,\nengage and retain employees better, with a strong focus on increasing\n\u201cemployee experience\u201d and \u201corganizational productivity\u201d.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR News:**[VCV Launches AI-Powered Platform to Simplify the Hiring\nProcess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/vcv-\nlaunches-aipowered-platform-to-simplify-hiring-process/)\n\nSingapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in HRTech adoption, but the\nscenario has been fast-changing over the last two years. This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm. Incidentally, Both Adrian Tan and hr tech.sg had worked\ntogether on the [2019 Market Map](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-marketplace/) also, which was widely acclaimed for his\ncomprehensive coverage of the categories and players.\n\nA step further, the 2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map has seen the addition of\nnewer HR categories and subcategories to help HR Professionals and Enterprises\nchoose the vendors in line with their specific needs.\n\nThe 2020 market map has been categorized the service providers across EIGHT\nmajor Talent segments: Talent Acquisition (Applicant Tracking System;\nSourcing\u00beJob Boards, Referrals, Tech Hiring, Non-PMET; Screening\u00beAssessments,\nVideo Interviews, Background Check), Talent Engagement (Employee\nCommunication; Onboarding; Performance Management), Talent Development\n(Coaching & Mentoring; Competency Management), Talent Operations **** (HR\nAutomation & Bots; Payroll), Talent Rewards (Benefits, Wellness, Compensation\nManagement), Talent Analytics, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS\nEnterprise and SMB\u2019s) and Talent Planning.\n\n\u201cThe need of the hour for HR functions is to aggressively adopt HRTech. This\nwill not only help the HR teams to solve pressing business challenges and use\nbudgets more efficiently, but it also improves candidate and employee\nexperience too.

Learning can never go\nwaste and you can certainly use tools such as learning management system to\nstudy new courses, learn new domains and expand your array. With learning\nmanagement systems, you can ensure contactless knowledge and information\ndissemination with mobile-based learning. A lot of organizations can leverage\ncollaborative tools like forum discussions, wikis to improve communication and\ncollaboration within the teams. E-Learning with gamification can truly create\na rich, interactive and engaging learning experience.\n\nWe can see that the numbers are expected to rise with the dangers posed by the\nvirus outbreak. Due to this pandemic, millions of the workforce across the\nglobe are working from home and the HR function along with the businesses at\nlarge have found that HRtech is the best bet during these testing times to\nimprove the team collaboration, productivity and keep achieving the business\noutcomes.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190308060624-ENT-\nIndia-Logo-White.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntrepreneurInd\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/EntrepreneurIND\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurind/\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

tech firm that uses artificial intelligence to quickly filter\njob applicants has managed to successfully complete a Series B fundraising\nround, despite financial markets catching coronavirus last month.\n\nMelbourne-based PredictiveHire finalised the $3 million raise, led by\nrecruiter Hudson with returning venture investors Rampersand and Capital Zed,\njust after bans on mass gatherings were announced and segments of the economy\nbegan shutting down.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nPredictiveHire co-founder and chief executive Barb Hyman. Manda Ford\n\nHowever PredictiveHire co-founder and chief executive Barb Hyman said\ninvestors could see that hibernating clients in the hospitality and non-\nessential retail sectors [were being offset by hiring surges\nelsewhere](https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/woolworths-hiring-20-000-to-\nmeet-demand-surge-20200327-p54ehc).\n\n\"Some of our FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] retailers, contact centres and\nemergency services clients have been getting thousands of applications per\nvacancy in the past couple of weeks, and they need a tool that can filter them\nquickly but with humanity,\" Ms Hyman said.\n\nPredictiveHire claims to have nine of the ASX 100 among its clients, including\nWesfarmers-owned Bunnings, who use its software-as-a-service to text\nquestionnaires to the mobile phones of job applicants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEncouraging 50 to 100 word answers to a handful of questions like 'what is a\nchange in your life that has happened to you and how did you deal with that\nchange?', PredictiveHire runs each submission through an engine that performs\na branch of artificial intelligence called natural language processing.\n\nBuilt on 25 million words texted back by 350,000 applicants for previous jobs,\nPredictiveHire claims its engine \u2013 run by co-founder Buddhi Jayatilleke, who\nbuilt the [data science team of human resources tech unicorn\nCultureAmp](https://www.afr.com/technology/employee-survey-start-up-culture-\namp-worth-1b-and-climbing-20190827-p52lcj) \u2013 can automatically provide hirers\nwith the applicants that best suit their pre-set criteria.\n\n\"There's a lot of ways people can game CVs, but it's the words and responses\nto relevant questions that give real insight into a candidate's suitability,\"\nMs Hyman said.\n\nShe admitted there was little the start-up could do about applicants who get\nsomeone else to answer the questions for them, but relied on that being picked\nup by the phone calls or face-to-face group interviews that followed on from\nPredictiveHire providing its shortlist.\n\n\"It's designed so that your best chance of success is being yourself,\" Ms\nHyman claimed.\n\n\"If English is your second language, there's no need to worry because we're\nnot biased against that, or race or gender or address or any of those factors\nthat work against diversity when hirers take the CV-reading approach,\" she\nsaid.\n\nFor the thousands of applicants that will inevitably be unsuccessful as the\nCOVID-19 crisis raises unemployment, PredictiveHire provides automated\nfeedback including six insights into their personality, and a coaching tip for\nfuture interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even in a usual year, the big hirers reject in six figures, and these people\nare also their customers,\" Ms Hyman said.\n\n\"They want to give them a good experience and constructive feedback, but\nthere's no way that's going to be done consistently for every candidate using\nmanual processes.\"\n\nPredictiveHire will use the $3 million injection, which takes its total raised\nto $5 million since launching two years ago, to further its push into graduate\nrecruiting.\n\nThis more sophisticated process, only possible as its proprietary data bank of\nwords had grown, was still in demand even as the pandemic stalled markets,\naccording to Ms Hyman.\n\n\"Good employers can see to the end of this and still want the best talent as\nit becomes available,\" she said.\n\n## How the coronavirus is changing markets, business and politics.\n\nCoronavirus: Need to know.

HR technology, buyers remain unsatisfied with\noutcomes.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 9, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JonathanSears-250x375.jpg)\n\nJonathan Sears\n\nSears says traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

I was deployed into custom technology\nprojects that quickly transitioned to a focus on Human Resources (HR)\nplatforms. That began my focus on HR, which then expanded into broader HR\ntransformation consulting (e.g. operating model, enterprise change, global,\netc.), and eventually a focus on broader Human Capital consulting. I\u2019ve been\nfortunate to be the US and Global HR Transformation business leader, and today\nI lead the US Human Capital business for Deloitte. I believe whether we\nachieve excellence is determined by the how the customer and/or our workforce\nfeel about the experiences we create and how, as a team, we deliver (or over-\ndeliver) on expectations and needs. I\u2019m proud to be part of an organization\nthat is deeply committed to excellence as an outcome.\n\n**What are your top 3 tips for the next generation of HR leaders?**\n\n  1. **Drive towards clarity of purpose** : Take the time to define your vision and how it connects to better outcomes for the business and better experiences for your workforce.   \n\n  2. **Lead the organization on digital enablement:** As the organization that impacts every member of the workforce regularly, you can take the lead on digital enablement and adoption. How you serve your own internal customers impacts their ability to serve your external customers. Redesign your own workforce and work to integrate humans with machines.  \n\n  3. **Embrace the ecosystem** : In years past, it was easier for HR to adjust services, operating models, technology or policies to keep pace with change. These days, the pace and frequency of change is faster, and the level of disruption is more complex. Embrace the role of ecosystem partners to fill capability gaps or to accelerate outcomes.  \n\n**Learn More:**[ **Analyzing the Impact of Technology in the Workplace: Q &A;\nwith Jill Goldstein of\nAccenture**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/digital-\ntransformation/jill-goldstein-on-technology-in-the-workplace/)\n\n**What is your advice for HR leaders facing technological disruption in the\nworkplace?**\n\nAs I stated in my tips above, you can take the lead in the organization and to\nfully embrace it. As you think about how to navigate the choices:\n\n  * **Evaluate the technology ecosystem through the experience lens** : Many organizations are still evaluating technology options through traditional lenses like cost, functionality and usability. Now you need to take a more strategic approach and first define the experiences you want to create for your workforce, and then evaluate which options can best deliver on those goals.  \n\n  * **Don\u2019t deploy in silos** : There is an abundance of technology options across the HR spectrum today (e.g. Recruiting, Learning, Leadership, Performance, etc.). Too often organizations are selecting and deploying individual solutions without consideration for the other existing or planned platforms. While some solutions may meet immediate needs of one function, you run the risk of not delivering the full value. Today\u2019s workforce expects the ability to personalize their experience, but they also want it to be more integrated and consistent. Always challenge your choices to see how well it integrates with your broader ecosystem and the extensibility of the solution.  \n\n  * **Get comfortable with experimentation** _:_ Many HR organizations have lived in an environment where new technology took months to design, months to build and additional months to test and deploy. It had to be proven before it can be deployed to everyone. As you evaluate new options, look for opportunities to accelerate deployment, test it with a small population, and give yourself flexibility to iterate, improve before deploying to a larger audience. In some cases, it may end up that you choose to discontinue. Better to know sooner rather than later.  \n\n**_In today\u2019s uber-competitive job scenario, what are the challenges for HR\nmanagers with the rise of the \u201csuper job\u201d and its impact on the workplace?_**\n\nThe hardest challenge for HR managers today is how to keep the machine\nrunning, while also upskilling the workforce to meet the rising needs of\n\u201csuper-jobs.\u201d This was recognized in our 2019 [Global Human Capital Trends\nreport](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends.html), as 86 percent of respondents cited reinventing the way people\nlearn as important or very important \u2013 the No. 1 trend for 2019. Upskilling\nand maintaining an emphasis on learning and development for all employees is\nessential to ensuring the organization can stay successful even if some people\nleave.\n\n> Super jobs are bringing together different skills and capabilities and\n> presenting great opportunities for individual growth, new career paths and\n> more talent mobility inside of organizations. Leading organizations are\n> empowering individuals\u2019 need to continuously develop not just technical, but\n> essential human skills by investing in new tools to embed learning not only\n> into the flow of work, but the flow of life.\n\n**A promising area to leverage new technology is onboarding and induction. Can\nvirtual or augmented reality be an effective tool to induct new staff?**\n\nMany organizations are using VR and AR successfully to enhance their ability\nto engage new employees during onboarding and induction beyond traditional\nmethods. These technologies can be used to help new employees feel more\nengaged with the corporate culture, provide key benefits for new employee\ntraining and speed time to effectiveness.\n\nSome examples of leveraging this technology for physical and corporate culture\nintroduction and engagement include:\n\n  * Using VR to provide an immersive introduction to corporate locations for workers relocating for their new position, or for remote workers, helping them gain insight into the organization and feel more connected. Combining this with leadership welcome messaging at the organizational level as well as tailored to their role provides a more personalized employee experience.  \n\n  * Using Augmented Reality markers in a physical space as part of an individual or group \u201cscavenger hunt\u201d approach to learning about a physical location, leadership and colleagues, and/or policies. This information remains available on an ongoing basis for employees to access\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Create a Culture of Digital Transformation: An\nInterview with Lisa Sterling of\nCeridian**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/digital-\ntransformation/lisa-sterling-interview-digital-culture-in-the-workplace/)\n\n**What trends are you tracking in the \u200bHR tech and candidate experience space\nfor 2020?**\n\nThere are several emerging trends in this space. Some examples include:\n\n  * Expanding beyond pilots in the AI matching space to enable enterprise-wide capabilities to match candidates to roles utilizing matching technologies  \n\n  * Focusing on key talent segments for assessments, to create opportunities beyond tech skills and entry-level employees to assess fit for the organization, by behaviors and values fit in addition to skills  \n\n  * A continued expansion of the Internal Mobility focus, to fill more roles within the organization internally, as opposed to relying so much on external talent  \n\n  * A drive to focus on the alternative workforce and the expectations of their experience engaging with the organization, providing opportunities for strong performers to work across the enterprise\n\n**_Neha:_** _Thank you, Michael, for sharing your valuable insights on the\nrise of the super jobs and the role of HR tech.

Sumser](https://hrexecutive.com/author/john-sumser/ \"Posts by John\nSumser\") | April 2, 2020 \u2022 4 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/426.png)\n\nEmerging Intelligence columnist John Sumser is the principal analyst at\n_HRExaminer_. He researches the impact of data, analytics, AI and associated\nethical issues on the workplace. John works with vendors and HR departments to\nidentify problems, define solutions and clarify the narrative. He can be\nemailed at hreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Coronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/) | [HR\nLeadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/)\n\nIt's not easy being in HR or HR tech right now. We are required to get better\nat managing distributed teams, work through downsizing, make our recruiting\nprocedures safer, soothe the organization\u2019s anxieties and find new ways to\nsustain employee trust in our organizations. We are operating in rapidly\nchanging business, legal and practical realities, and are struggling to\nprioritize. Because we are managing in a pandemic with exponential growth, our\ncollective sense of reality is challenged day by day. We face a relentless\nwave of new realization and understanding.\n\nUltimately, the pandemic will plateau.\n\n[**Read all of _HRE '_s coronavirus coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\n\"https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\")\n\nWhen? Some suggest that things may stabilize in a few weeks. Others estimate a\nyear. I expect meaningful stabilization around August. By then, cause and\neffect will have returned to a more understandable relationship. Still, the\nworld will be very different.\n\n\u201cFlattening the curve\u201d does not change the virus. It makes the (hopefully\nreduced) number of cases happen over a longer period of time. Until there is a\nvaccine (at least a year from now), we will be dealing with health and safety\nas primary concerns. Social distancing will be a way of life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet possible to clearly see the next stage. It is possible to prepare\nfor it, nonetheless. In the midst of coping with the disaster as it evolves,\nwe have to continuously focus on where we are going to land. Survival is not\nenough. Surviving prepared to thrive is a minimal goal.\n\nMy colleagues Michael Kannisto, Heather Bussing and I are beginning to build a\nlibrary of topics to follow to maintain your strategic edge while dealing with\nthe overwhelming problems of today. It is important to solve today\u2019s issues in\na way that prepares us for a deeply uncertain future\n\n**Understanding and Inventorying Skills is Essential**\n\nFor example, we see succession planning evolving from a \u201cWho gets to join the\nclub?\u201d exercise to an ongoing capacity planning and protection system. With an\never-present danger that 15% to 20% of the workforce will be sick for a\nsignificant period, the definition of who is or isn\u2019t essential will change.\n\nWhile current succession-planning regimens pay close attention to the\nexecutive team, the future of our organizations depends on lower-level\ntactical expertise. Three questions to ask are, \u201cWho, by name, are the people\nwho understand the technologies we depend on? Are they the only people who\nunderstand that technology? And what do we do if they are gone?\u201d\n\nThe questions are particularly relevant while considering organizational\nrearrangements and downsizing. It\u2019s often the case that essential workers are\noften nearly invisible. Ask \u201cWhich systems do we depend on, and who runs\nthem?\u201d It's likely you will discover that years of emphasis on efficiency have\nleft us ill-prepared for disaster.\n\nMore than ever, we need a complete inventory of the skills and capabilities in\nthe workforce. In most companies, only 20% to 25% of workers complete their\nHRIS employee profiles under normal circumstances. Right now, understanding\nthis information is essential. Encourage and reward the participants.\n\n**Improving Search to Effectively Use Data**\n\nOnce we have a thorough inventory, we need the ability to effectively search.\nHR-tech search is rarely as good as what we get from Google. So, we are going\nto need both a comprehensive inventory and the ability to use it effectively.\n\nFortunately, vendors of recruiting technology have been solving the search\nquestion. Companies like HiringSolved make it possible to search all of the\ndata in your applicant-tracking, candidate-management and HR systems. You can\nsee everyone in the ecosystem (as long as current employees complete their\nprofiles).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a number of intelligent tools that focus on career path, internal\nmobility and skills identification. Comprehensive succession planning will\nneed to build on that capacity. The goal is a process that identifies and\ninventories the broadest range of skills possible. Vendors include\nHiringSolved, Fuel50, Workday, IBM and Phenom. While none have a specific\noffering, all of them have the capacity to execute.\n\n**Using Intelligent Tools to Provide Updated Information**\n\nThe next months will also find HR teams fielding an exploding volume of\nquestions from employees. Installing a tool like Socrates.ai helps reduce the\noverall workload while ensuring consistent and accurate answers to pressing\nquestions. For example, Socrates.ai integrates data from all of your HR\nsystems to provide single-thread answers to over 9,000 questions.\n\nAs our work and work environment continue to evolve, intelligent tools make it\npossible to navigate the crisis while ensuring a good landing in the\naftermath. Right now is the right time to start outfitting your company for\nthe near future.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-focusing-hr-tech-development-in-the-time-of-the-virus%2F)\n\n[ __Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=John+Sumser%3A+Focusing+HR-\ntech+development+in+the+time+of+the+virus&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-focusing-hr-tech-development-in-the-time-of-the-virus%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-focusing-hr-tech-development-in-the-time-of-the-virus%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

What\u2019s next? The majority of\nbusinesses and HR departments now recognise the strategic importance of using\ntechnology in their operations. Many, however, are still figuring out how.\n\nA thumb rule of successfully using new-age technologies like AI in HR is \u2013\nimproving your data. Technology can only be as strong as the information that\npowers it. Banking on the right information not as simple as pushing a button.\n\nSourcing the data and managing it has to become a core function of human\nresources, for HR tech to work its magic on company processes. Workforce\nanalytics isn\u2019t new. Great line HR mangers have always analysed employee data\nto inform their decisions. Technology tools have expedited, streamlined and\nautomated the process.\n\nWhat then are the roadblocks to adoption of AI, Machine Learning and\nBlockchain in HR? Do you have quality data?\n\nThe benefit of taking a technology approach can be highly limited by the\nquantity and quality of data available.\n\nSay, you want to predict which of your present employees would make a good\nsalesperson. In no circumstance, can you answer that without ample data on\nemployees\u2019 performance, their preferences and capabilities, and the\ncharacteristics of a salesperson that benefit your business? Add to it that\nyou need significant data points to come up with a universal answer (that\napplies to all employees and your business needs).\n\nCommon roadblocks to bringing about HR transformation through technology are\nlimited data, hesitant leaders, shortage of resources to work on data, and\nregulatory restrictions. However, the need for quality data trumps it all.\nWithout it, no real change is possible.\n\n  * [Blockchain is set to transform the foundation of business](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-set-to-transform-the-foundation-of-business/)\n\n## Toward HR Technology: Busting the limitations\n\nEfficient data management should primarily include three practices:\n\n  * pinpointing right sourcing points\n  * consistent data definitions, and\n  * data entry and cleaning culture (a feat in itself).\n\nThe better these practices are engraved in your functioning, the more data you\nwill generate and its quality will be rich to be used for informing decisions\nand automating processes with accuracy.\n\nAs a starting point, we explore the data points three of the much talked about\nnew-age technologies \u2013 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and\nBlockchain \u2013 need to improve your productivity. They are not all-inclusive,\nbut indicators to get HR managers started.\n\n **Must-have Data Points for HR: In AI, Machine Learning & Blockchain**\n\n## AI in HR\n\nArtificial Intelligence is complex technology. It feeds on data, and get\nsmarter as more data is given to it. AI can learn and based on the learning;\nit can act independently without the need for human intervention. The only\ncondition being: it needs data. More and more people should submit their data\nfor AI to perform tasks with accuracy.\n\nGreater and 'relevant\u2019 data are the foundations to make AI systems smarter and\nseamless. It applies to HR tech too.\n\nWhen can you use AI? When there is a task that can be automated.\n\nExploring the objectives human resource professionals can fulfil with AI; and\nessential data points.\n\nObjectives of AI in HR:\n\n  * [Blockchain is going institutional \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-going-institutional-and-thats-a-good-thing/)\n\n  * Employee Learning. Based on employee\u2019s preferences and performance, AI system can give training (online or offline) recommendations.\n  * Enrolling for benefits. AI can check eligibility and approve one for the benefits.\n  * Initiating a retirement. An Exit process can be made easier and automated with AI.\n  * Managing leaves. AI can decrease leaves, adjust them, and resolve related queries, based on embedded algorithms.\n  * Source candidates. Based on what talent works and what doesn\u2019t for a business, the process of targeting and inviting the right candidates can be automated.\n  * Resume screening and detecting anomalies. AI can sift through the barrage of resumes with high accuracy and less bias.\n  * Detecting employee attrition. AI HR tech can detect patterns of even the slow withdrawal of employees from the business process.\n\nData points to look out for:\n\n  * Performance reviews\n  * Experiences, skills, and qualifications desired\n  * Employee exit metrics\n  * Absenteeism\n\n## Machine learning in HR\n\nMachine learning is under AI umbrella. AI can create intelligent machines that\ncan think like humans, machine learning allows machines to learn from data.\n\nML can help human resources draw conclusions and show a correlation between\ndata points.\n\nFor instance, OLX Group identified flight risk markers with machine learning.\nAggregating data from previous years, it reached the conclusion that\ncompleting a 12-month mark, and working in a unit that\u2019s below-average\nsatisfaction levels are two prominent flight risk markers.\n\nWhen is machine learning used? Drawing conclusions from myriad data points.\nThe use of AI and ML, however, is bleeding into each other.\n\nObjectives of Machine Learning in HR:\n\n  * Staffing\n  * Employee engagement\n  * Finding out if higher training benefits are preferred over average spike in salary by employees?\n  * Employee retention\n\nData Points to look out for:\n\n  * Round the season sales. Figure out the shopping season for your business. Use this to augment your staffing needs and scheduling processes\n  * Foot traffic. Can figure if a particular event (road closure or other externalities) led to ore footfall, and how you fared with respect to your competitor\n  * Others mentioned in the section on AI in HR\n\n## Blockchain in HR\n\nBlockchain is yet to scale in HR tech. Less than five per cent of\norganisations presently use blockchain in human resources. The tech can,\nhowever, gain prominence in recruiting and data protection, as the talent war\nand calls for the privacy of data becomes louder.\n\nObjectives of Blockchain in HR:\n\n  * Data privacy and security\n  * Resume verification\n  * Financial management\n  * Protecting the intellectual property of the business\n\nData Points to look out for: It\u2019s not data point as much as creating an\nenvironment for confidentiality that\u2019s important to implement blockchain tech\nin HR. Proofing recruiting, and maintaining data confidentiality is where\nblockchain can give confidence to companies and HR managers.\n\n **HR Transformation: How do you collect data?**\n\nOther than KPIs there are many valuable metrics that can be collected by HR to\nimprove processes.\n\nPulse surveys, discussion forums, suggestion boxes, thinking workshops,\ncandidate resumes, performance reviews, and other such sources can be used to\ncollect desired data. Instead of undertaking data collection when the need\narises, the data tap should remain open. Much better if you can place a team\nto structure and clean it (the overarching goals and objectives for which will\nhave to be provided by you).\n\nGamification is another novel method. Crunchr in Netherlands uses 16 question\ngames to find what employees\u2019 value most in their workplace \u2013 covering salary,\nbenefits, career growth, the security of job, engagement, and other aspects.\nThe game is anonymous (except for collecting basic information such as\nacademic level, experience, gender, etc.) that ensures participation.\nPreference groups based on different sub-groups are then formed from the\nresults.\n\nAsking the right questions is key to unravel the potential of HR Technology.\nThe best questions are those that led to insights!\n\n  * [Blockchain: Is it the future of FinTech?](https://www.itproportal.com/features/blockchain-is-it-the-future-of-fintech/)\n\n _Ariaa Reeds, writer_\n\n### Topics\n\n[technology](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/technology/)\n\n[hr](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/hr/)\n\n[human resources](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/human-resources/)\n\n[artificial intelligence](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/artificial-\nintelligence/)\n\n[machine learning](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/machine-learning/)\n\n[blockchain](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/blockchain/)\n\n__Get Weekly News and Analysis\n\nSign up below to get the latest from ITProPortal, plus exclusive special\noffers, direct to your inbox!\n\nNo spam, we promise.

Oracle is a well-established HCM\nvendor.\n\nCatz added that any [coronavirus-related economic\nimpacts](https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/news/252481154/Paycheck-\nProtection-Program-could-help-MSPs-make-payroll) will be different from past\ndownturns.\n\nOracle's subscription revenues now account for 71% of its business. Because of\nthis contracted revenue, Catz said the company expects minimal virus-related\nimpact this quarter. She contrasted that to 2001, when the dot-com bubble\nimploded. At that time, license revenue \"was a very large percentage of our\nbusiness\" and it dropped significantly, she said.  \n\nOverall, Oracle's revenue increased 2% to $9.8 billion for the quarter and\nbeat expectations.\n\nBut the HR technology market is vast and many are funded by venture capital.\nAnalysts see the potential for rough times ahead for this market, if customers\nrethink their spending plans.\n\nLast week, IDC forecasted \"a significant slowdown\" in IT spending for\nhardware, software and services. Its most pessimistic scenario put global IT\nspending growth at 1% for 2020. That's compared to its original forecast of\nmore than 4% growth.\n\nThe HR technology market may see a retreat of buyers [because of the\ncoronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/goldman-thought-economy-was-\nrecession-proof-in-january---it-wasnt.html). This may prompt vendor\nconsolidations and closings of weaker firms.\n\nHR startups in the very early stages that don't have a lot of revenue are\n\"going to have a really tough time,\" said George LaRocque, an independent\nanalyst at HRWins, which tracks VC investments.\n\n\"There'll be a lot of IP [intellectual property] that gets acquired for\npennies on the dollar by larger startups acquiring smaller startups,\" he said.\n\nLast year, [HR VC\ninvestments](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252475982/HR-\nvendors-to-watch-in-2020), globally, were $5.33 billion, an increase of about\n33% from the prior year, LaRocque said.\n\nThe leading VC investment area is in job boards or firms specializing in\nparticular verticals. Last year's VC spending growth was due to some big\ndeals, LaRocque said. A $300 million investment in RigUp Inc., an Austin-based\nfirm focused on connecting a workforce with energy sector firms, was one\nexample, he said.\n\n### __Customer budgets in holding pattern\n\n\"I think every vendor's pipeline is going to go into a holding pattern while\n[customer] budgets get reevaluated,\" LaRocque said.\n\nHR budgets have already [been flat to\nshrinking](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252470174/Economic-\nworry-may-be-impacting-HR-budgets), according to Gartner. It raised warnings\nabout an economic slowdown last fall, well before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n> I think every vendor's pipeline is going to go into a holding pattern while\n> [customer] budgets get reevaluated.  **George LaRocque** Principal analyst,\n> HRWins  __\n\nJosh Bersin, an independent HR analyst, believes HR vendors in startup mode --\nor those with less than $2 million in revenue -- \"are going to find the next\nyear or two more difficult, unless they have a very unique offering, amazing\nbrand recognition or strategic partnerships.\"\n\nBuyers of HR technology are overwhelmed by too many vendors, Bersin said. He\nhas been tracking around 4,000 HR tech vendors. \"At least 3,000 of them are\nless than 10 years old, and they are all VC-funded,\" he said.\n\n\"There could be a big shakeout,\" Bersin said.\n\nThe HR tech market may see \"massive consolidation ahead as larger players pick\nup smaller players at lower valuation in the next two to three months,'' said\nR \"Ray\" Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\n\nThe [recruiting segment of the\nmarket](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Heading-into-2018-HR-\ntech-market-remains-hot-and-competitive) will still be important if the\ncoronavirus crisis ends in the next several months, Wang said.\n\nWhat happens remains to be seen, but the pace of change has been remarkable so\nfar, LaRocque said.\n\n\"The most astonishing thing is how quickly everything is changing,\" LaRocque\nsaid. \"If you think about where we are at this moment today, it's very\ndifferent than where we were two weeks ago.\"\n\n####  Related Resources\n\n  * [Talent Management Systems](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1430133355_488.html) -ComputerWeekly.com\n  * [Why You Shouldn\u2019t Be Afraid of Deciding on a Talent Management System](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1579117861_62.html) -Cornerstone OnDemand\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Talent management systems\n\n  * [\n\n##### Transformational HR in 2020: 7 strategies for agility and tech mastery\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Transformational-HR-\nin-2020-7-strategies-for-agility-and-tech-mastery)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement in HR shapes performance and payroll tech\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/wallask_scott.jpg) By: Scott\nWallask ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nin-HR-shapes-performance-and-payroll-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n##### New tech trends in HR: Josh Bersin predicts employee experience 'war'\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/wallask_scott.jpg) By: Scott\nWallask ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252448535/New-tech-\ntrends-in-HR-Josh-Bersin-predicts-employee-experience-war)\n\n  * [\n\n##### HR is failing to use people analytics tools, new report says\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252435104/HR-\nis-failing-to-use-people-analytics-tools-new-report-says)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

HR tech is rapidly evolving and taking huge strides that\nare transforming our work environment. Traditionally, the HR department has\nalways been a time-intensive and paper-intensive one. With digitization\nbringing a change of direction in the tides, more and more companies are\nmaking the switch to digital from traditional. The impact of technological\nadvancements is a profound one, one that gives rise to quicker adoption of\nfaster and more efficient tools. HR tech comes in many forms, such as:\n\n **Applicant Tracking System:** Applicant tracking system relies on a\ncentralized database to streamline the entire recruitment process of an\norganization. With the help of cloud-computing, ATS is capable of screening\nall the CVs based on predefined search criteria. This enables recruiters to\nfocus on things like evaluating the cultural values and personality of a\ncandidate.\n\n **Payroll Management Software** : Designed to measure the hours logged in by\nan employee and their attendance, as well as manage holiday calendars and\nleave policy. The payroll management software improves work efficiency, is\nsecure and maintains transparency throughout the workplace.\n\n **Employee Perks, Rewards & Recognition Platform:** To reduce attrition and\nkeep the employees engaged, HR managers and leaders are leaving no stone\nunturned. The use of platforms like Advantage Club is helping the HRs keep\ntheir employees happy and satisfied by giving their employees access to the\n10,000+ brands where they can redeem their earned points. The brands are\nfurther divided into 12+ categories for the ease of the users. Apart from\nperks and rewards, Advantage Club also has features like Buzz, that lets all\nemployees know what's going on in their company. It also focuses on\nrecognition among peers and well as across the various levels of hierarchy in\nthe organization. The platform also supports the employee engagement activity\nbuckets like Hobby Club, where an employee can join and connect with their\ncolleagues who share similar interests. They can also post their pieces of\nwork, like painting, creative writing, photography, etc on the wall.\n\n **Better Communication Software:** Digital tools like social media newsfeeds,\nIMs, career sites & social intranets are instrumental in keeping everyone in\nthe loop. They promote interactions in the organization, build coordination in\nteams and improve the overall performance of the employees.\n\n **Performance management Software:** Companies are adopting performance\nmanagement software to assess the output of their employees with the help of\nactive tracking. The upper management can make decisions based on the data\nfrom the software regarding training, promotions, and recruitment.\n\n **Feedback:** The latest HR Tech have a built-in feature of giving and\nreceiving feedback. Feedback helps the employee as well as the organization to\nlearn about shortcomings, the scope of improvement, the remedies, as well as\nthe new opportunities in the industry. It is vital for identifying key areas\nin the organization that needs work and if unchecked, will have a negative\neffect.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[Advantage Club](/tags/Advantage-Club-98382/) [Technological\nadvancement](/tags/Technological-advancement-105984/)\n[employees](/tags/employees-2386/) [employers](/tags/employers-45149/) [HR\nTech](/tags/HR-Tech-86338/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

That's the advice of HR technology guru Josh\nBersin._\n\n_We sat down with Bersin, founder of the Josh Bersin Academy, a professional\ndevelopment school for HR, at last week's IamPhenom conference_ _in\nPhiladelphia, held by the talent experience software provider Phenom._\n\n_Here, Bersin discusses how HR and IT should deal with the exponentially\ngrowing HR technology landscape and whether technology is actually the key to\na great employee experience._\n\n**In terms of the HR technology buying team, how would you characterize\ncollaboration between HR and IT teams?**\n\nJosh Bersin: It's complicated. We're at a stage of the [HR tech\nmarket](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade) where there's way too many tools. It's\nout of control. HR needs IT so that IT can put together an architectural\nstrategy for all these tools. We can call it part of the employee experience\nor the talent experience. We don't want the employees to have to log into 15\ndifferent things or download different apps to use all of our HR systems. We\nwant [things like] single sign-on and security. We have GDPR, we want to make\nsure the [data's\nconsistent](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-barriers-to-\ncreating-data-driven-HR-and-how-to-overcome-them), and we don't have different\ndata elements being collected in different places or replicated data in\ndifferent places. And all these tools have AI so they're all intelligent data\ncollection systems on their own.\n\n![Josh Bersin](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/bersin_josh.jpg)\n\nSo, the IT people are getting more involved than ever. IT departments need to\nbe much more like systems integrators and really look at how these things are\ngoing to fit together and slow down the buying.\n\n**How can IT help HR leaders address the tech overload?**\n\nBersin: The new model is starting to evolve to be like the iPhone -- you can\nfind any app you like, download it, run it and then delete it if you don't\nlike it. That's really where IT needs to go. Companies have to figure out some\nform of plug-and-play strategy.\n\nMore of the vendors are building interfaces to the big HR platforms, and some\nof the big vendors like Oracle, SAP, Workday, ServiceNow and ADP are becoming\nmore integration platforms. So, if you're an ADP customer, if you're a Workday\ncustomer, there are tools [from other vendors] that have been [preset for\nintegration]. You can just select from that list so they're kind of\necosystems.\n\n> Focus on the employee experience and the big problems before [you] go out\n> and buy all the tools.  **Josh Bersin** Founder, Josh Bersin Academy  __\n\nBut a lot of companies have multiple geographies; they go through\nacquisitions; they actually have five HR systems, [for example]. So, vendors\nlike IBM and some of the big integrators are now spending a lot of time\nhelping companies connect all these things together because there's not one\neasy plug-and-play architecture yet. We've reached that stage where\n[integration and ease of\nuse](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Three-truths-about-\nintegrated-HR-systems-IT-and-HR-should-know) is more important than a really\ncool feature that was built from a vendor we'd kind of like to have.\n\n**HR leaders are being told they need all these exciting or new technologies.\nWhat's your advice for them?**\n\nBersin: HR leaders need to make sure they slow down the process a little bit\nand focus on the employee experience and the big problems before they go out\nand buy all the tools.\n\nLet's suppose we want to have a well-being app --\n[mindfulness](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Secrets-of-tech-\nenabled-workplace-mindfulness-programs), exercise, fitness, diet -- there's a\nmillion of those. But HR leaders need to consider:\n\n  * How are employees going to get to it?\n  * How are they going to log into it?\n  * What platforms are they going to build around it?\n  * Is the IT department going to support it?\n  * What versions of the operating system will it run in?\n  * Where will the data go?\n  * Who's going to secure the data?\n  * How much of the data is even legal for us to even look at?\n\nSo, more of these decisions have to get slowed down and reviewed by IT. Good\nHR departments have an [HR tech committee](https://www.gruppomarcucci-\nusa.com/news/engage-employees-to-make-your-hr-technology-more-productive/) and\nit includes the buyers, the specialists who need to know what the products do\nand then somebody in IT, and somebody in the data -- and sometimes there's an\nanalytics group -- and they all work together. They look at the options and\nthey make sure the pieces fit and form a reasonable architecture.\n\n**What tools should they tackle first, especially as it relates to employee\nexperience?**\n\nBersin: You have to know how the company is doing it today. So, for example,\nif you're shopping for a new recruiting system, all the critical stakeholders\nshould come together to discuss it. And some of them are going to get excited\nabout a lot of things. But you need to get under the covers of that and look\nat what [core technology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/8-HR-\ntechnology-trends-CHROs-should-investigate-in-2020) you already have. You have\nto do [a request for proposal] from the standpoint of the purchasing\ndepartment, but that doesn't tell you that much. What you really need to do is\npick a product you like and then pilot with a small number of people and see\nhow well it works.\n\n__Josh Bersin discusses the true meaning of employee experience at the\nIamPhenom conference.\n\n__\n\n**A lot of vendors are selling tools as the key to the employee experience.\nWhat do you think of that?**\n\nBersin: Vendors have oversold HR technology as the key to employee experience.\nIf what you had was bad or you didn't have anything, technology can help.\nEverybody gets very excited about the technology.\n\nThe more important things at work are the work itself, the managers, the way\nyou treat employees, the pay, the sense of fairness, the sense of inclusion\n[and] employees' opportunity to grow. Those are the things that really drive\nthe employee experience. The software doesn't do that.\n\n#### __Next Steps\n\n[Does AI belong in HR?](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/opinion/How-\nwill-AI-in-HR-be-a-game-changer)\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on HR systems and HCM software\n\n  * [\n\n##### Transformational HR in 2020: 7 strategies for agility and tech mastery\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Transformational-HR-\nin-2020-7-strategies-for-agility-and-tech-mastery)\n\n  * [\n\n##### IT's technology experience problem gets HR tool\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252475127/ITs-technology-\nexperience-problem-gets-HR-tool)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement in HR shapes performance and payroll tech\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/wallask_scott.jpg) By: Scott\nWallask ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nin-HR-shapes-performance-and-payroll-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n##### SAP CX move with Qualtrics challenges Salesforce, Oracle\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/scardina_jesse.jpg) By: Jesse\nScardina ](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/news/252452489/SAP-\nCX-move-with-Qualtrics-challenges-Salesforce-Oracle)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Tackle Gender Imbalance at Workplace\n\n __ Mar. 20, 2020 at 12:31 pm\n\n[News & Analysis](https://www.cxotoday.com/category/news-analysis/ \"News &\nAnalysis\")\n\n# HR Tech That Could Tackle Gender Imbalance at Workplace\n\n![CXOtoday News\nDesk](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/698fa9b223721385ee2d50a38388d3a2?s=22&d=mm&r=g)[CXOtoday\nNews Desk](https://www.cxotoday.com/author/cxonewsdesk/) __3 weeks ago\n\n![AI](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Artificial-\nIntelligence-1.jpg)\n\nBy Prasad Rajappan\n\nAs per the research and study by the [World Economic\nForum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-\nequality#report-nav), none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and\nnor likely will many of our children. That\u2019s the sobering finding of the\nGlobal Gender Gap Report 2020, which reveals that gender parity will not be\nattained for 99.5 years. Despite several measures taken across the globe\nGender inequality remains consequential and multidimensional. We can tackle\nthe Gender Imbalance in the workplace by harnessing technologies and practices\nsuch as AI/ML, strong HR policies, capturing the female progression through\nlearning management systems and succession planning. Let us examine each of\nthese technology practices one by one.\n\n**Adopt AI/ML and Robotic Interviews in Hiring to Reduce Gender Bias**\n\nAI is disrupting every day in the life, including how organizations are hiring\ntoday. With the new technologies in the new world of AI-based hiring could\nhelp us reduce error and bias in our hiring and onboarding processes. A lot of\nresearch has highlighted an inconsistency around gender imbalance. One of the\nbiggest advantages of AI is that it is great at ignoring things. Just imagine\na scenario a person who is intellectual, ethical, and open-minded who is fair\nin the hiring practices with no intention of being gender-biased, sees a\nfemale candidate sitting in front of him. He may think that though this person\nis a woman I am not giving my evaluation with any bias in my mind. AI can be\ntrained to ignore things like anyone\u2019s gender and focus on relevant aspects\nlike experience, skills, and the potential of that person. With AI and Machine\nLearning, the algorithms can be trained in such a way that it will be blind to\ngender. Machine learning can throw up the compatible candidates who are fit\nfor the job role.\n\n**Career Progression of Female Employees through Learning Management Systems**\n\nCareer Progression is a significant tool for both organisations and their\nemployees. When any employees are confused about what are the career\ndevelopment options available to them or the Business is unclear about what\nwill be the learning path which is required to achieve the Business Outcomes,\ncareer progression delivered through learning management system can provide\nthe needed clarity. Career Progression of female employees conducted through\nLMS systems can provide the basis for an individual\u2019s learning and a guide\nagainst which they can measure their progression.\n\n**Strong HR Policies on Gender Discrimination**\n\nAt any workplace, on an average 1 out of 4 women have been either physically\nor mentally harassed. Three in ten young women (30%) said they had experienced\nsex discrimination when working or looking for work. 75% of young women and\n58% of young men said that women still face discrimination in the workplace.\nEmployers should take measures to avoid such misdemeanors to happen at the\nworkplace. It is preeminent to have a strict policy against workplace offences\nlike gender discrimination, sexual harassment, racism, bullying, and many\nmore. Each and every organization should ensure that they have strong HR\npolicies in place and for such offences they are penalized.\n\n**Accelerate Female Progression with Succession Planning**\n\nThe major reasons why succession planning and leadership development are of\nextreme importance and can help in accelerating female progression are\nrecruitment and retention of the best talent, greater leadership\nresponsibility despite the gender imbalance. With succession planning in\nplace, the progression and identification of the successor will be formal,\nSystemic, tailored, experientially based instead of the gender biases.\n\nChanges in societal attitudes have helped significantly, however, it is\nthrough harnessing the AI, machine learning, strong HR policies, capturing the\nfemale progression through learning management systems and succession planning\nin place we can remove the gender gap in business once and for all.\n\n_(_ _Prasad Rajappan is a visionary and a thought leader, who brings nearly\nthree decades of HR experience into_ reputed companies, like Reliance\nIndustries, Ernst & Young and Mahindra & Mahindra.

Thousands of employers, training\norganizations, associations, certification programs, and workforce development\ninitiatives use Credly to help individuals translate their learning\nexperiences into professional opportunities using trusted, portable, digital\ncredentials.\n\nThis empowers organizations to attract, engage, develop, and retain talent\nwith the data-driven insights provided by Credly addressing skills gaps and\nhighlighting opportunities.\n\nThe business was founded in 2012 by CEO Jonathan Finkelstein, who had\npreviously co-founded two other companies in the workforce and learning space,\nLearningTimes and HorizonLive, which was acquired by Blackboard in 2010.\nCredly was a natural evolution of that work.\n\n\u201cFor the first four years, we grew the old-fashioned way, by making products\ncustomers love, saw value in and were willing to pay for,\u201d says Finkelstein.\n\u201cThen, in 2016, the movement we helped create started to become mainstream,\nand we brought on a group of partners as investors to accelerate our growth\nand fulfill demand.\u201d\n\nCredly has raised $20 million to date from investors that include leading\nsocial impact and venture firms, large public companies, strategic partners,\nand non-profit organizations.\n\n**Appraisd**\n\nPerformance management system [Appraisd](https://www.appraisd.com/\n\"https://www.appraisd.com/\") helps organizations move from single annual\nappraisals to a continuous performance discussion with a simple, employee-\nfirst interface.\n\nIts strength lies in its ability to fit in with the organization's own culture\nand way of doing things. It empowers employees to give and receive feedback on\ntheir own terms, set up regular check-ins with their line manager, manage\ntheir goals and develop their career plan.\n\nAppraisd was founded by Roly Walter in his spider-infested garden shed. He had\nstarted his career as a business analyst at Goldman Sachs designing global\nonline HR tools, and it was that experience that inspired him to design and\nlaunch Appraisd, which now has hundreds of customers all over the world. And\nthey've moved out of the shed.\n\nLaunched in 2012, to date Appraisd has had no external investment or funding.\n\n**EnterpriseAlumni**\n\nPowering the alumni networks of some of the world\u2019s largest companies,\n[EnterpriseAlumni ](https://enterprisealumni.com/\n\"https://enterprisealumni.com/\")helps them leverage this vast untapped pool of\npeople as a source of high-quality recruitment, sales, marketing and\ncommunity. Customers include Nestle, P&G and HSBC.\n\nThe business was founded by siblings James and Emma Sinclair. \u201cWe are proud to\nbe the only software company in the world who have gender balanced investors\nat scale: our cap table is 50/50 men and women,\u201d says James Sinclair.\n\nTotal investment to date is $15 million from top venture funds, including the\ntop three European-based VCs and strategic investors, such as Mike Ettling,\noutgoing President of SAP SuccessFactors, and Lord Mervyn Davies, co-author of\nthe UK Government\u2019s report on gender equality on boards.\n\nThis year EnterpriseAlumni was labelled \u2018a very important technology\u2019 by\nDeloitte/Josh Bersin in the HR Tech Disruption Report Deloitte\n\n**TravelTime platform**\n\nPeople think and plan their travel based on time rather than distance, and\nthat\u2019s important when it comes to the daily commute to work. Using real-time\ntravel data, the [TravelTime ](https://www.traveltimeplatform.com/\n\"https://www.traveltimeplatform.com/\")platform is an API and analytics tool\nthat lets users search location data using minutes rather than miles, and is\nproving valuable to the recruitment sector.\n\nBy showing job listings reachable to candidates in a maximum commute time of,\nfor example, 30 minutes, rather than a distance of 10 miles, it helps job\nsites deliver the most relevant search results for job seekers and recruiters.\n\nFounded by Charlie Davies, the current CEO, and Peter Lilley, the platform in\nits current form using location-based analytics was launched in 2013. Clients\ninclude Jobsite, as well as other sectors where search is an important part of\nthe process, such as Rightmove and Zoopla.\n\nLast May iGeolise, the creators of the TravelTime platform, announced a \u00a33.2\nmillion ($4.1 million) funding from ETF Partners.\n\n**Intrro**\n\nEmployee referrals are one of the most effective ways of hiring new people, as\nthey tend to get hired faster and stay in their jobs for longer.\n[Intrro](https://www.intrro.com/ \"https://www.intrro.com/\") makes it easier\nfor companies to connect with qualified candidates in their employee\u2019s social\nand professional networks. The employee referral platform uses machine\nlearning to automatically match the relevant talent to open positions,\nenabling employees to reach out to their contacts to let them know about the\njob opening.\n\nInstead of getting another unsolicited recruiting message from a stranger,\nrelevant candidates receive a personalized message from their contact. If they\nare interested they can directly respond to the recruiter, who can take it\nfrom there.\n\nIntrro also enables recruiters to browse their employee's contacts against\nopen positions, and proactively ask for an intro, allowing them to spend more\ntime speaking to receptive candidates and less time chasing leads, whilst\ngiving hiring managers access to a broader, verified and more diverse pool of\ntalent.\n\nFounded by Neel Jamie Shah and Nasser Oudjidane in 2018, the company has\nsecured $500,000 from a range of investors, including 500 Startups, Spartech\nVentures, plus strategic angel investors such as Saif Kidwai, founder of\nDigital Gurus, a specialist recruitment technology consultancy.\n\n**Personio**\n\nHeadquartered in Munich, Germany, [Personio](https://www.personio.com/\n\"https://www.personio.com/\") is a HR, recruiting and payroll platform that is\nalready digitising the HR departments of almost 2,000 SME customers in more\nthan 40 countries.\n\nFounded in 2015 by CEO Hanno Renner, Roman Schumacher, Arseniy Vershinin and\nIgnaz Forstmeier, the company recently expanded into in the U.K.\n\nThe innovative SaaS solution combines HR core features in one digital tool,\nenabling HR managers and business leaders to manage things like attendance\ndata, absences, and salaries consistently.\n\nPersonio recently announced its latest series C funding round of $75 million,\nbringing the total investment secured to $130 million.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@alisonbcoleman) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisoncolemanfreelance/).

We've known each other a good number of years\nand I've come to appreciate and admire his sharp wit and encyclopedic\nknowledge of the HR space. In this discussion, he offers his view on what we\nshould and should not be doing, the impact of regulation on the workplace and\nlets us in on the expansion happening with his firm, [Otter\nAdvisory](https://www.otteradvisory.com/).\n\n## Armchair epidemiologists\n\nFirst up, Otter is unambiguous about what he sees as a distracting and\npotentially dangerous trend:\n\n> I think my main advice at the moment is, if you're not an expert in a\n> particular field, leave that discussion to the experts. If you're not a\n> statistics expert, don't spend your afternoons making prediction graphs and\n> posting them on the internet because there are enough people doing that\n> already. Probably too many. If you're not a recognized expert don't pretend\n> to be one. I think the people that think they know what they're talking\n> about are probably the ones we need to be most afraid of at the moment. For\n> me, I think it's a case of treading carefully. The obvious things of looking\n> after your people comes first. Too much speculation and too much gazing into\n> crystal balls is not going to do us any good.\n\nFor more on that topic, readers might be interested in [this thread about\nexploding whales](https://twitter.com/dahowlett/status/1247162181960871941).\nSeriously. Moving on.\n\n## Doubling down on HR admin\n\nI've tended to a jaded view of HR as primarily an administrative function.\nOtter argues that while there is truth in that, rapdily introduced changes in\nlaw and regulation have placed extraordinary burdens on HR departments.\n\n> Most of the time you're right, administratives processes are pretty\n> standard, but at the moment, some of these processes are going to change\n> daily. For instance, what is a essential worker? In some countries it's very\n> clear but in some places like the UK, the government has not been\n> particularly clear at defining what is an essential. There are many more\n> examples and so I think for HR, these represent massive periods of\n> administrative disruption.\n\nEmployee tracking has featured in a few recent discussions. According to\nOtter, it is relatively easy to spin up a screen that notes when a person is\nsick but he regards this as a 'dumb idea,' reminding organizations that there\nare laws around this topic, regardless of pandemic conditions and that\norganizations considering this type of application should ask themselves about\nthe purpose this serves rather than making it up as they go along. I asked\nwhether it makes sense to partially suspend some of the laws around privacy in\nthese extraordinary circumstances. His reply was unequivocal:\n\n> I think the opposite. If you look, for instance, at GDPR, it contains\n> specific procedures for handling epidemics. So I think the law is actually\n> is pretty good for these things. I don't feel like all of these things\n> should be thrown out, partly because when this goes away, the controls don't\n> go away, they stay. So for instance, if you suddenly start introducing ID\n> cards in the UK and France, do you think when the virus has gone the\n> government's gonna delete all that data and say, okay, well, no more and no\n> SA and ls considering any form of change in procedures or surveillance to\n> work with internal haealth and data officers to fully understand the purpose\n> and ensure that whatever measures are brought in that they respect and\n> comply with legislation.\n\nThis will vary from country to country. For example, TripActions laid off\nemployes in the UK, USA and Australia but kept people in the Netherlands as it\napplies for emergency funding to cover payroll. In the UK, there is talk of\nextending the scope of business help to include forms of co-funding between\nVCs and the government that will allow startups to continue operations.\n\n## Strategic thinking\n\nMore generally, Otter urges HR departments to stick with what they are doing\nand ensure people are not only paid but paid correctly. This is not easy when\nlegislation and regulation is unfolding on a daily basis but not impossible.\nHe also reinforces the fact that law, custom and practice vary from place to\nplace and that it is vital HR departments communicate in weays that are\nappropriate to the locale. Further, Otter argues that while the kneejerk\nreaction to this kind of event are to institute broad brush cuts:\n\n> Now is a good time to be thinking about scenario planning for your long-term\n> workforce strategy. It might for example turn out that in some situations\n> remote working makes better sense for both employer and employee. But the\n> point is this - we don't know what will happen next but we can imagine a\n> variety of scenarios and plan around those. It's the best way to help the\n> board make the right decisions and act quickly once we see how the world\n> looks.\n\nAt this point. the conversation turned a tad philosophical and speculative but\nOtter brought up the point about climate change and how the new abnormal has\ntransformed once heavily polluted cities to have clear skies. He posits that\nthese types of obvious impact could well drive different policies which, in\nturn, impact they way we work. It's an interesting discussion and one that I'm\nsure will play out long into the future.\n\n## What's next?\n\nWe then turned to what Otter is doing with his firm.\n\n> I've always believed that we should use our expertise in a collaborative\n> fashion and in my field, one thing that technology companies struggle with\n> is marketing, which when done well as is a positive thing but when it's done\n> badly it's a swear word.\n\nTo that end, Otter recently partnered with Rachel Jenkins a seasoned marketing\nexpert who has worked at both startups and established global HR tech vendors.\n\n> It's all about less fluff and helping the smaller vendors collaborate well\n> with the large vendors. They both need each other but it is often difficult\n> for those small companies to get the attention they deserve. Also, those\n> smaller vendors often hire someone who is super smart and has a B2C\n> background where they need coaching on B2B. We want to help those people.\n> It's early days but let's see wherer this goes.\n\nAnd with that we were done.\n\n## My take\n\nChewing the fat with super smart people is always fun and Thomas Otter falls\nsquarely into that category of pragmatic thinkers who is looking around the\ncorner for what needs to be done next. His advice concerning policy change is\nwell taken while having an eye on the long-term may not resonate with some but\nmakes for good sense as we look ahead. What do you think? Let is know in the\ncomments.  \n\n_Image credit - YouTube video_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  * [HCM and the digital future of work](/category/hcm-hr-future-work)\n\n### New on

In my previous column, I advised HR leaders to press the\nexecutives of the technology providers on their commitment to ongoing\ndevelopment and product roadmaps, to carefully monitor impacts to customer\nservice and account management, and to develop HR-technology strategies that\ncontain contingencies in case solutions are retired or sunsetted due to M&A\nactivity. I think these basic recommendations are still valid, so I recommend\n[checking out that piece](https://hrexecutive.com/navigating-mergers-and-\nacquisitions-in-hr-tech/) for more details on how to navigate M&A activity\nwith regard to HR technology.\n\nBecause honestly, even though HR tech is my beat and dominates my professional\nlife, these major shake-ups are not what has been consuming my thinking\nrecently. While \u201cbig\u201d news, these transactions pale in comparison to what is\nhappening in the broader world of work.\n\nIn a \u201cnormal\u201d world, the above-mentioned M&A activity and subsequent fallout\nwould dominate the HR and workplace conversation. But, as everyone is well\naware, nothing about the last few weeks has been \u201cnormal.\u201d As of right now,\nthe most important issue impacting work, workplaces and people across the\nglobe is the increasingly scary and spreading coronavirus, or COVID-19. I\nwon\u2019t bother to recap the current state of the crisis; even if I could, that\ninformation would be dated within minutes of my writing it down. Let\u2019s just\nsay that, while things are not looking encouraging at the moment,\neventually\u2014let\u2019s hope\u2014this global crisis will begin to come under control, and\nthings like software companies buying other software companies will capture\nour interest again.\n\nSo, even if we are in the beginning stages of this crisis, or somewhere toward\nthe midpoint, I do think there are already some extremely important things we\ncan learn from it, and that can, and perhaps should, be applied to the\norganization of work, the design of workplaces and the ways that employers\nengage with employees and their communities.\n\nFirst, and the most apparent workplace implication from the spread of\nCOVID-19, surrounds the importance of remote work and work-from-home policies,\nincluding how open and prepared organizations are to adopt these policies. It\nseems likely that, with the virus emanating from China, the country with the\nworld\u2019s largest workforce, we are now in the middle of the [largest-ever\nexperiment](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/asia/coronavirus-work-from-home-\nintl-hnk-scli/index.html) with remote working. For many readers, whose\norganizations are in the U.S. and not as yet subject to significant or direct\nimpacts, the time is now (actually the time was probably weeks or months ago)\nto put in place a comprehensive protocol for remote work. Policies,\ntechnologies and methods of communication and engagement all are needed. One\nof the many enduring lessons from COVID-19 will be how it shifts remote work\nfrom a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d perk to an essential component of every enterprise\u2019s\nbusiness and operations strategy.\n\nNext, this crisis has to remind us\u2014and force us\u2014to recognize the truly global\nnature of work. Even if we think we are a small organization in the middle of\nAmerica without any international operations or customers, this outbreak,\nwhich developed in a medium-sized city on the other side of the world, now\naffects all of us. Even the smallest organizations can see disruption in\nprocurement, for example, given the global nature of manufacturing of parts\nand supplies of all kinds. Or, a prolonged crisis might impair ability to\nsecure financing, if a global financial recession makes access to capital more\ndifficult. And let\u2019s not forget about people issues. You may have an employee\nwith a relative working or living in one of the areas of the world under the\nmost direct threat from COVID-19. You could have employees who now are\nunwilling to go on business travel, even domestically, after seeing news\nreports about the spread of the virus, and the idea of being in crowded\nairports and airplanes seems a risk not worth taking. It is eye-opening to\nthink about how so much of the world is connected. And we have to think about\nour organizations in that way from now on.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, this global crisis has reminded us all\nabout the importance of open, timely and transparent communication. When\nthings are uncertain, when events unfold that are outside our expectations and\nexperiences, and especially when a situation seems a little bit scary, HR and\nbusiness leaders have to actually lead. A large part of leadership is helping\npeople work their way through this uncertainty in a manner that is calm,\nsensible and honest. Even if your organization is not yet directly at risk\nfrom COVID-19, chances are that, as this situation continues, your business\nwill be impacted. Whether it is a dramatic fall in your stock price, a loss of\nrevenue from canceled customer orders or something worse, your obligation as a\nleader is to communicate with your people as frequently and openly as\npossible. Even if you are a little bit uncertain or scared yourself.\n\nI hope that by the time I have to draft the next monthly Inside HR Tech\ncolumn, how organizations are leveraging HR solutions to help them achieve\ntheir business and talent strategies will be top of mind again. Thanks for\nindulging your friendly Inside HR Tech writer and I hope that you, your\norganization and your employees remain safe and healthy.\n\n|\n\n* * *\n\n| [![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)  \n---|---|---  \n|\n\nCatch **Steve Boese** as a Programme Chair at the upcoming  \n[HR Tech Festival Asia\n2020](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post)\n(12 \u2013 13 May, Singapore),  \nthe region\u2019s largest HR technology conference and exhibition.\n\n| [**Get _your front row seat online\nnow_**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/registration?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post%20Register)  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png) |  |  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-navigating-mergers-acquisitions-and-coronavirus%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Steve+Boese%3A+Navigating+mergers%2C+acquisitions+and+coronavirus&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-navigating-mergers-acquisitions-and-coronavirus%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-navigating-mergers-acquisitions-and-coronavirus%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Some of the changes they make will be superficial, such\nas having a day on which they celebrate remote employees, but the best\ncompanies will take a science-first approach, focusing on improving employees\u2019\ndaily working lives in substantial ways, and increasing psychological safety,\nthe foundation of sustained employee engagement.\u201d\n\n[**Ken Lazarus**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenlazarus/) **, CEO,**[ **Scout\nExchange**](http://www.GoScoutGo.com)  \n  \n\u201cIn 2020, we will finally see AI having a significant impact on Human\nResources. This is being driven by an increase in the use of cloud-based\ncomputing power and tools as well as increasingly sophisticated algorithms and\nHR-focused applications.\n\nAI is being used to narrow potential candidates through technologies such as\nchatbots and candidate scoring. Here at Scout our AI-driven recruitment\nmarketplace connects employers with thousands of top-performing specialty\nrecruiters to fill positions faster with great talent.\u201d\n\n## **2\\.

Companies Will Embrace On-Demand Talent Models**\n\n[**Michael P. Morris**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/topcodermike/) **, CEO,**[\n**Topcoder**](https://www.topcoder.com/)  \n  \n\"In 2020, one of the biggest trends in HR will be the increasing move by\nemployers to embrace new, open workforce models and on-demand talent networks\nto further their talent acquisition strategies. Given the flexibility offered\nby a gig economy lifestyle, more and more people are joining it. A study by\nIntuit predicted that by 2020, 40 percent of American workers would be\nindependent contractors. For Gen Z, the gig economy is already commonplace; a\nstudy by Upwork found that in 2018, 46% of Gen Z workers were already\nfreelancers. To find in-demand skills, HR must be innovative in their\nrecruiting and retention efforts, as traditional ways to find talent don't\nwork for this new age of employee \u2013 a mobile, multitasking, gig economy\nworkforce.\u201d\n\n## **8\\. Company Culture Will Become More Meaningful to Attract Talent**\n\n[**Jon Stross**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonstross/) **, President, and\nCo-Founder,**[ **Greenhouse**](http://www.greenhouse.io)\n\n**\u201c** In a competitive hiring market, strong company culture is a key factor\nfor drawing top talent. And today\u2019s candidates no longer care about free beer\nor \u2018nap rooms\u2019 in the office, they want to know that a company\u2019s culture puts\nthem first. That means increased transparency from senior leadership, better\ncareer advancement opportunities and more meaningful benefits (parental leave\noptions, etc.) are now table stakes for candidates. 2020 will see\norganizations increase their focus on company culture initiatives to offer\nmore significant perks that put the employee first.\u201d\n\n**[Rhiannon Staples](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiannon-staples-6916b73/),\nChief Marketing Officer, [Hibob](https://www.hibob.com/)**\n\n\"Building and maintaining a strong culture, especially in the face of\nturnover, will be a key focus for companies over the next five years, and they\nmust find and leverage technologies that help employees adapt to change and\nfind their place within a company. For example, through Hibob\u2019s platform bob,\nemployees can join groups based on shared interests in order to build\nrelationships with employees they may not interact with otherwise.

That means jobs will\nchange faster than ever before requiring a constant reorganization of staffing\nmodels and the workers within it. Employers will need the right set of tools\nto communicate when these changes occur to ensure supply can align with\nconstantly changing demand, but it will also require processes and systems in\nplace that allow employers to reskill their existing workers so that they are\nable to be as agile in their careers and have the right tools and support in\nplace to change with the times and not be displaced by them.\"\n\n## **10\\. HR Technology Will Be Targeted Toward High-Growth Companies**\n\n**[Rhiannon Staples](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiannon-staples-6916b73/),\nChief Marketing Officer, [Hibob](https://www.hibob.com/)**\n\n\"There will be an increase in HR technology targeted towards high-growth\ncompanies.

What a decade. Thank goodness _that\u2019s_ over. Flexible working, the gig\neconomy and an explosion of HR tech solutions have left many human resources\npractitioners scrambling to make sense of a fast-changing and tech-driven\nworkplace.\n\nBut hang on to your hats. HR tech is likely to be even more relevant \u2013 and\njust as challenging \u2013 in the 2020s. Here are some tech trends to watch out\nfor.\n\n**Remote or virtual workplace technologies  \n**Despite the burgeoning popularity of flexible working, there is still ample\nroom for related technologies to grow.\n\n\u201cThere are already several solutions to address the challenges remote\nworkforces present for organisations. Everything from collaborative workspaces\nto virtual office spaces,\u201d says Emily Fritz, at employer brand specialist firm\nExaqueo.\n\nFritz added that the sector is still in its infancy, and that the next 10\nyears will see a race for businesses to develop solutions to cater for the\nboom in the number of remote workers.\n\n**The rise of the health and wellbeing market  \n**\u201cMost of the big healthcare providers are pouring money into new AI-based\nautomated tools, and these can be mixed and matched to fit any workforce in\nthe world. Wellbeing platforms can bring these applications together and\ncreate real behavior change for your workforce,\u201d observes analyst Josh Bersin.\n\nTools for mental and emotional health, stress reduction, physical fitness,\ndiet, and financial wellbeing are beginning to proliferate.\n\n\u201cThis is a market I don\u2019t think existed ten years ago. Today this is a true\nsegment of the tech market and HR and people teams should understand what\u2019s\navailable, because these are critical issues for the company brand,\u201d he adds.\n\n**Digital ethics  \n**HR will play a significant role in the ethical introduction of automated\ntechnology, such as if an employee needs to be redeployed due to the influence\nof AI.\n\n**Increased use of people analytics for actionable insights  \n**HR will need to enhance their use and grasp of analytics \u2013 such as running\nexperiments and influencing business strategies that boost the organisation\u2019s\nbottom line.\n\nAccording to a recent report, [The Changing Face of\nHR](https://www.sagepeople.com/face-of-change/), just 42% of companies are\nusing data to drive HR decision-making \u2013 so there remains much to do.\n\n**Device fatigue  \n**The average person checks their smartphone every 12 minutes and receives\nover 60 phone notifications a day. It\u2019s hardly surprising that device fatigue\nis on the rise.\n\n\u201cWith screen-time under scrutiny for its negative impact on our health, I\nthink we will see more technologies adjust to address the health and wellness\nconcerns centred around device fatigue,\u201d says Fritz from Exaqueo.\n\nFritz alluded to Instagram\u2019s recent decision to remove \u2018likes\u2019 from people\u2019s\nposts as an example of technology \u2013 in this case social media \u2013 becoming more\neconomical with the number and type of notifications they display.\n\n_Parts of this article first appeared on\nthe[Sage](https://www.sagepeople.com/) website._\n\n**Want to know more about what\u2019s coming in the world of HR tech?

There are many milestones in the evolution of\nHR tech, but many HR experts consider 2012 as the mark of a generational shift\nin technology and a new league of application in the HR tech industry. This is\nmainly attributed to the introduction of SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, and\ncloud), according to HR Technologist.\n\nIn this new decade, new (and not-so-new) tech trends are about to disrupt the\nHR sector like never before. HR and people experts around the world revealed\nsome of the trends to watch for:\n\n**1\\. Going beyond functionality to add value to employees**\n\nThe right HR tech doesn't just automate tasks for employees but also enables\nthem to contribute fully and maximize their potential as unique individuals.\nApproaches should move toward liberating and empowering people - and HR\ntechnology should support this change. The HR sector can also expect to see a\nshift toward managing teams, groups, and networks - rather than just\nindividuals. HR systems, therefore, should focus much more on a group's value,\naccording to Jon Ingham, author of \"The Social Organization\" book.\n\n**2\\. Organizational guidance systems**\n\nThe time has come to create an organization guidance system that business and\nHR leaders can use to provide course-correcting and enable more effective\norganizations. It moves beyond scorecards, dashboards, and predictive\nanalytics into an integrated guidance system that enables more effective\norganizations and business decision-making.\n\nExisting data collection overwhelms business leaders who struggle to sort out\nwhich ideas to use. An organizational guidance system, however, articulates\ndesired business, customer, and investor outcomes and then offers guidance to\nattain them, said Dave Ulrich, Rensis Likert professor at the Ross School of\nBusiness, University of Michigan.\n\n**3\\. AI-filled recruitment market**\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nRecruitment is now the biggest AI market in HR, with AI-based sourcing,\nassessment, screening, interviewing, and candidate experience management now\navailable. Like the rest of HR, recruiting teams have to be systems\nintegrators.\n\nAlso, many recruitment vendors are drifting into internal talent mobility,\ncareer management, and other adjacent areas. It's because the recruitment\nmarket is crowded, and many of these vendors have useful HR technology for\ninternal mobility. Thanks to the ever-tightening labor force, this internal\nrecruitment market is now bigger than ever, according to analyst Josh Bersin.\n\n**4\\. Health and well-being market explosion**\n\nThe $48-billion corporate well-being market is perhaps the most fragmented and\nexplosive of all. Tools for mental and emotional health, stress reduction,\nphysical fitness, diet, and financial well-being are everywhere.\n\nMost big healthcare providers are injecting money into new AI-based automated\ntools, and these can be mixed and matched to fit any workforce in the world.\nWell-being platforms can bring these apps together and create real behavior\nchange for your workforce. Thus, HR and people teams should understand what's\navailable, as these are critical issues for employment and company brands,\nsaid Bersin.\n\n**5\\. Remote or virtual workspace technologies**\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of flexible working, there's still plenty of\nroom for the sector to grow. There are already several solutions to address\nthe challenges that remote workforces present for organizations - from\ncollaborative workspaces to virtual office spaces. However, the sector is\nstill in its infancy, and we're still to see a race for businesses to develop\nsolutions to a growing contingent of remote workers, according to Emily Fritz,\nemployer brand specialist at Exaqueo.\n\n**6\\. Addressing notification and device fatigue**\n\nThe average person checks their phone every 12 minutes and receives about 64\nphone notifications a day. With screen-time under scrutiny for its negative\neffect on our health, we will see more technologies adjust to address the\nhealth and wellness concerns centered on device fatigue.\n\nThis increasing level of awareness will also extend to notifications. Pointing\nto Instagram's decision to remove likes from people's posts, Fritz said that\ntechnology would follow suit by becoming more economical with the number and\ntype of notifications they show.\n\n**7\\. Career coaching technology**\n\nAs the development of workplace technology continues to gather pace,\norganizations will need to provide a higher level of coaching technology to\nemployees.\n\nUp until now, employees are expected to seek these resources on their own and\nspend their money outside the company. However, the mindset is shifting thanks\nto millennials, according to J.T. O'Donnell, CEO of Work It Daily.\n\n**8\\. Increased usage of people analytics for actionable insights**\n\nThe continued use of people analytics remains a top HR technology trend. HR\nand people leaders will need to advance the use and maturity of analytics even\nfurther, such as by running experiments and making an impact on business\nstrategies and bottom-line growth.\n\nHR leaders should develop how to ask questions and run experiments across the\norganization before deciding on a certain course of action - becoming\nevidence-based instead of instinct-based - said Gautam Ghosh, HR influencer,\nspeaker, and writer.\n\nMeanwhile, Sage People's \"The changing face of HR\" research report revealed\nthat only 42% of organizations are currently using data to drive HR decision-\nmaking, which means that there's still a lot more to do.\n\n**9\\. Increased employee experience-driven initiatives**\n\nThe focus on employee experience intensifies and doesn't seem to show any\nsigns of slowing down. It was raised by many experts, including people\nanalytics leader Soumyasanto Sen, who said that the demand has already started\non the consumerization front of HR customers.\n\nFor instance, AI will continually be used to build better employee experience.\nWhile AI is taking over, employers finally realize that they must put people\nfirst. Pool tables and open-concept seating is not where to put employee\nexperience; getting feedback from the people you're trying to show\nappreciation to might help, according to Jazmine Wilkes, HR generalist at SEA\nWire and Cable.\n\n**10\\. HR and people teams as tech and process tsars**\n\nDigital tools can, by reviewing the current ways of working, likely force a\nreview of unproductive and wasteful internal processes, according to Perry\nTimms, founder of People and Transformational HR. As a result, HR and people\nteams are ideally placed to introduce leaner, more agile and responsive\nprocesses that are in tune with what people and the organization need - as\nprocess tsars in organizations.\n\n### Related stories\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "COVID-19 sets crypto startup funding back a year - Decrypt", "link": "https://decrypt.co/24828/covid-19-sets-crypto-startup-funding-back-one-year", "guid": "CAIiEK-_g0MP1nlSgwDPWtOMGEwqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowrYiSCzCUsacDMM7muwY", "pubdate": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 18:57:06 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://decrypt.co/24828/covid-19-sets-crypto-startup-funding-back-one-year\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 sets crypto startup funding back a year</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Decrypt</font>", "source": "Decrypt", "body": ""}, {"item": "[Trends 2020] How will HRTech Shape This Year?

Higher employee\nengagement tends to have an improved business outcome, increases Ebitda\nmargins and better customer experience. Employee engagement strategies can\nincrease happiness quotient also it helps in retaining employees and manage\nattrition in the workspace.\n\n##  **Continuous Performance Feedback Would Become a Key HR function**\n\nThe 2019 Gartner Performance Management Benchmarking Survey showed that 81 per\ncent of HR leaders are making changes to performance management. Around 82 per\ncent of HR leaders say performance management is not effective at achieving\nits purpose, and only 38 per cent say it is keeping pace with organisational\ngoals.\n\nA 360-degree continuous performance feedback management tool can enable each\nindividual, all your teams who are a part of the organization, to succeed in\ntheir goals. Continuous performance feedback is a new way of looking at the\ntraditional employee performance reviews structure. Instead of bi-annual or\nannual reviews, continuous performance feedback results in a more holistic and\naccurate picture of employee performance.\n\n##  **Personalised Learning Experiences Would Become Pivotal For Future\nWorkforce**\n\nOn-demand micro-learning has become essential for organizations to improve\nemployee performance. It reduces attrition and fosters a collaborative work\nenvironment. Multi-lingual learning adds to its effectiveness. L&D teams must\nrecognize the needs of each employee and use specific knowledge about them to\npersonalize their learning. Personalized learning is a journey and it can\nimprove employee engagement.\n\n##  **HR Data Analytics Will Be Key For Organizations and CXOs To Drive\nEfficiency  **\n\nBig data and analytics would be a key thing to drive process re-engineering\nand 'outcomation'. In today's world, next-level HR leaders are hypercritical\nand imperative for the success of fast-growing progressive enterprises. HR\nleaders are now becoming part of the boardroom bringing data to the table in\ndecision-making conversations and making better-informed decisions. Data-\ndriven decision-making can have a huge impact on the topline and bottomline of\nthe business. HR analytics empowers you to take the right action basis\nintelligent data insights and provide businesses with a real-time view of the\nHR metrics. As organizations rethink their HR processes to succeed in an agile\nand dynamic business environment, the continuous improvement approach will\nhave a pervasive impact on business outcomes.\n\n##  **Robotic Process Automation Will Take Some Actual Big Steps In\nOrganizations  **\n\n[RPA](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/311550) adoption is bound to\nincrease in the coming decade, as has been made evident through multiple\nresearch studies conducted by organizations worldwide. One such study has been\nprovided by Gartner, which lay emphasis on AI (the think engine behind RPA)\nand how they are bound to increase productivity in general across all\nindustries, as can be observed in the following image. This does not\nnecessarily have to imply that such computational intelligence is imminently\ngoing to replace and eradicate the jobs of professionals, but instead is\nprimarily focused on working in tandem and enabling human intervention through\nstructured data management powered by ML.\n\nA simple example that can be referred to over here, in order to better\nunderstand RPA, is the usage of AI and ML in the process of recruitment. A\ntask as tedious as resume stacking that ideally would require several man\nhours, can be processed rather instantaneously through the application of such\ntechnology, as it utilizes the parameters such as competencies and skills,\namong others, to search and map out relevant resume profiles that would be\nbest-suited for the particular job profile or project at hand.\n\n##  **Cloud Service Will Take a Driver Seat For Data Across Formats  **\n\nThe age-old stigma against [cloud\nservices](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/335155), especially observed\nthrough public sector companies, is no longer prevalent, as increased\ndevelopment in cybersecurity and data privacy capabilities of new-age server\narchitectures, ensure that enterprises are provided with the highest level\nencryption so that the security and confidentiality of their data is always\nmaintained. With the inclusion of hybrid server capabilities, wherein data is\nmaintained at local hubs, but may be processed on the cloud, or even a\nscenario wherein private servers can be maintained with limited back door\naccessibility to ensure that extremely confidential data, such as account\nnumbers of customers of a bank, remains completely secured with no room for\nany external user to access this data for any misuse. Such practices are cost\neffective, easy to implement and maintain and can enjoy all the benefits of a\ncloud based server which were earlier missing out on on-premise solutions.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190308060624-ENT-\nIndia-Logo-White.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntrepreneurInd\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/EntrepreneurIND\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurind/\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

As a result, most are unable to focus nearly as much of their\nattention on the human employees working for their organizations.  The answer\nto the problem is robotic process automation.  By automating these redundant\ntasks, HR practitioners can move out of the office and on to the floor where\nemployees need their attention and where they can build and strengthen the\npeople function.\n\nBut where to begin?  What are the benefits of RPA?\n\nAutomation Anywhere's _RPA:   An Executive Primer_ answers those questions by\nexplaining, in detail, what robotic process automation is and how it works.\nIt also explains the basic components needed for an RPA strategy and how to\nmanage and scale a digital workforce.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n  * Higher accuracy rates in data entry\n  * Improved employee productivity\n  * Cost savings\n\n_Photo courtesy:   Pexels_\n\nDownload Your Copy\n\nWe respect your privacy, by submitting this form you agree to having your\ndetails passed onto the sponsor who may promote similar products and services\nrelated to your area of interest subject to their privacy policy.

With so many advancements, HR continues its digital\ntransformation.  There is no end in sight and that is both exciting and a bit\nterrifying for the same reason:  HR professionals have no idea where the road\nis going.\n\nThe big star of the year was, without a doubt, artificial intelligence.  It's\nrise as an HR technology can be described a meteoric in nature.  It continues\nto be adapted to all areas of human resources such as a data gathering and\nautomation.  It is also the base technology behind the increasing use of chat\nbots and machine learning.\n\nVirtual reality is another technology on the way up.  Primarily used as a\ngaming technology, VR is now being used by HR as a recruitment tool.  How?\nCompanies are deploying the technology as a way for potential employees to\nvisit the company headquarters without ever having step foot on the property.\nIt's also being used to assess job candidates' skills before proceeding with\nan interview.  VR is also being used as a learning tool -- allowing companies\nto test and train for soft skills.  It's also being used as a way to train\nemployees on difficult subjects such as workplace violence and sexual\nharassment.  Not only can employees learn how to deal with these issues, they\ncan do so in a safe environment.\n\nThe sky is the limit and the 2020 stage has been set for more exciting\nadvancement.  As we move into the new year, here are the Top 10 HR Tech\nArticles of 2019.\n\n# Best of HR Tech\n\n**1\\. Why HR is at the Center of Digital Transformation**\n\n\"Digital transformation is primarily about mindset, people and processes and\nnot technology.  HR is in the people business and any successful digital\ntransformation relies on significant contributions from HR professionals.\"\n\nHR Technologist contributor Ashish Deshpande writes the digital transformation\nis neither a single project nor a single technology.  Really, it's about\nmodernizing and bringing a much stronger digital footprint to bear in the\norganization.  A big piece of that is reliant on the people and business\nprocesses at any given company.  Deshpande takes a deep dive into the topic\nexplaining several points including how HR plays a dual role in today's world\nand why the digital transformation is crucial for talent acquisition.  Read\nmore [here](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/why-hr-is-at-the-center-of-digital-transformation/).\n\n**2\\. AI and Blockchain in Human Resources**\n\nSince their individual inceptions, both artificial intelligence and blockchain\nhave been looked at as viable HR technologies.  Now, Dr. Tirath Virdee, the\ndirector of Artificial Intelligence for Capita Plc says the \"whole employee\nlife cycle will be disrupted by the implementation of digital identity in the\nform that can be realized using Blockchain technology.\"  AI, which is a bit\nolder than blockchain, is already being used and in droves.  For instance, AI\nhas already been built into many strategies including that of recruitment.  To\nread more from Dr. Virdee on how artificial intelligence and blockchain\ncontinue to disrupt HR, [click here](https://artificial-\nintelligence.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/ai-and-blockchain-in-human-resources-\nnid-29501-cid-175.html).\n\n**3\\. HR tech is amazing equalizer in quest for diversity and inclusion**\n\n\"In the world of HR, technology can truly be an amazing equalizer. After all,\neven with the best of intentions, implicit biases may sneak into the resume\nselection of even the most well-intentioned of managers.\"\n\nFor some time now HR professionals have tried, and failed in some respects, to\nremove bias from the recruitment process.  It's not an easy prospect.  Leaders\nare looking everywhere for strategies that put an end to bias.  Enter HR\ntechnology.  In her piece published on Campaign Live, Gradient managing\npartner Pauline Oudin discusses how technology can be leveraged to stave off\nthe impact of bias on the recruitment process.  Going a step further, Oudin\nalso discusses what needs to get done in order for technology to work with\nrespect to diversity and inclusion.  Read more\n[here](https://www.campaignlive.com/article/hr-tech-amazing-equalizer-quest-\ndiversity-inclusion/1588703).\n\n**4\\. Digital HR: What Is It and What 's Next?**\n\nTechnology has changed the game for everyone, including human resources.  In\nhis latest piece published on the HR Exchange Network, Dave Ulrich focuses on\nthe implications of HR Technology, which he says can be grouped into four\nphases of evolution in Digital HR.  Those include efficiency and information\nas well as innovation and connection.  Ulrich takes a closer look at each one\nand explains how technology is being used in these areas.  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/articles/digital-hr-what-is-\nit-and-whats-next) to read more.\n\n**5\\. Uniting VR and AI to supercharge HR practices**\n\nInnovation Enterprise Channels author Caitlin Stanway-Williams starts out\n[this piece](https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/uniting-vr-\nand-ai-to-supercharge-hr-practices) with a keen observation.\n\n_\" Place a worker from 30 years ago in an office today and they would probably\nfeel like they had been dropped in an alien world.\"_\n\nStanway-Williams says this has been driven by the data boom of the past\ndecade.  In fact, data has created a number of solutions that have had an\nimpact on HR practices including artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\nShe says \"88% of companies worldwide use some form of AI in their HR\npractices.\"  Stanway-Williams explains how VR and AI are developing empathy\nskills and training workers.\n\n**6\\. Empowering HR Leaders with Technology to Improve Engagement and\nRetention**\n\nTechnology is a powerful tool.  When it comes to Human Resources, it can\nempower leaders.  That's according to ion Learning CEO Shavon Lindley.  In her\narticle on the HR Technologist, Lindley explores this idea and offers some\nreal ways technology improves the working lives of HR professionals.  Read it\n[here](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/empowering-\nhr-leaders-with-technology-to-improve-engagement-and-retention/).\n\n**7\\. AI in HR**\n\nArtificial intelligence is pushing humans and machines closer together.  It's\nexciting!  AI's influences are being felt across the HR space\u2026 being used to\nautomate business processes, enhance efficiency, and reduce bias among other\nthings.  In fact, McKinsey's latest forecast of AI's impact on the global\neconomy is that it will generate $13 trillion in economic activity across the\nglobe by 2030. But there is room for improvement.  Read how by clicking\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/articles/ai-in-hr).\n\n**8\\. The Legal Impact of AI on HR**\n\nShould the use of artificial intelligence be legislated? If you don't know\nyour position on the question, read [this\narticle](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/articles/ais-legal-impact-\non-hr) to help you decide.  It provides some of the latest developments in the\nAI space and what's at stake at the federal and state level with regards to\nthe technology and how it may or may not impact HR as a whole.\n\n**9\\. Recruit Like A Social Media Influencer**\n\nAre you recruiting like a social media influencer?  If you're an HR\nprofessional using or looking to use social media as a recruitment tool, you\nneed to seriously consider taking this approach.  And the data supports the\nembracing of the strategy.  Young Americans, according to a survey from\nMorning Consult, say their dream job is to be a social media influencer.  A\nstunning 85 percent of Millennials or Generation Z people, ages 13 to 38, say\nthey're willing to give the gig a shot.  Imagine the results if a company\ncould turn these workers into recruiting social media influencers?  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nacquisition/articles/recruit-like-a-social-media-influencer) for more.\n\n**10\\. The Changing Workforce Landscape**\n\nInnovation is doing the same thing, but better. Disruption is doing new things\nthat make the old ways obsolete.  The digital revolution, the popularity of\nsocial media and the market entry of accessible artificial intelligence have\ndramatically changed the way we live, impacting every market in every\nindustry, forcing companies to adapt - and fast.  And it's had a major impact\non the workforce.  Atrium Health and HR Exchange Network Contributor Sebastien\nGirard explains in his article [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntech/articles/the-changing-workforce-landscape).\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

This includes cloud computing solutions,\nhub technologies, artificial intelligence, people analytics, process\nautomation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics. How\nindividuals interact with technology, along with the new tools at our\ndisposal, is changing how we work. HR can\u2019t sit idly by; it must help drive\nthe transformation. Yet making sense of the implications for HR is no simple\ntask.\n\nWalking the floor at the 2019 HR Tech Conference and Expo, we overheard some\nconsistent themes from HR professionals in attendance. The overwhelming number\nof vendors and point solutions meant more, not less, uncertainty when it comes\nto determining where they should invest. Many struggled to find value in the\nhuman capital management systems already in place; there were questions about\nwhat solution would work best given their circumstances, and who within the\norganization was making the decisions. In many instances, it seemed that the\nentire process of deciding on the right technology was in the hands of IT,\nrather than HR.\n\nConference attendees express a consistent need to do a better job of taking\nthe multitude of disparate, inflexible platforms that make up current HR\nservice delivery and find ways to tie these together to create a more\ncompelling employee experience and to make it easier for HR teams to integrate\nplatforms so they can be more productive. It\u2019s about simplifying the complex.\nThis need for a consistent employee experience \u2013 every touchpoint between HR\nprograms and the individual employee - aligned with the employer\u2019s distinct\nEmployee Value Proposition, seemed to be the Holy Grail of the conference\nexperience.\n\nSo how can organizations make sense of this bewildering technological market?\nI believe the answer is to focus on the three most useful and promising\ntechnologies that HR can use to make smarter decisions faster.\n\n### **Hub Technologies: Centering the experience around the individual**\n\n  \nTo keep the \u201chuman\u201d in HR, technology should focus on helping individuals make\ninformed decisions about the rewards and development programs available to\nthem.\n\nOrganizations clearly want the best talent possible to deliver on their\nmission. When done right, that mission is tied directly to its unique employee\nvalue proposition (EVP). There\u2019s no such thing as a cookie-cutter approach for\ndeveloping an EVP \u2013 every organization must differentiate its strategy based\non its unique brand and a sense of purpose. Likewise, there\u2019s no such thing as\na \u201cbest practice\u201d for adopting HR technologies relevant to specific\norganizations.\n\nNo two employers have the same talent goals, so the right ecosystem for one\norganization may not be right for the next. A global software developer has\nvery different HR needs from a mid-sized Midwestern manufacturer. While there\nare plenty of behind-the-scenes processes and transactions that are similar\nfor both, the need to entice and motivate talent requires a very organization-\nspecific mix of employee-facing technologies.\n\nAlong with creating a unique EVP, there are millions of distinct employee\nexpectations. The best employee experience is designed for every individual we\nserve, which demands that we treat each one uniquely, using communication\nchannels, content, tone, and data aligned with each person\u2019s expectations.\n\nHuman-centered design, the process of building out the full user (in this\ncase, employee) experience based on the people you\u2019re designing for, and\nending with interactions that are tailor-made to suit their needs, helps to\nachieve this audience-of-one focus. A generic approach can be valuable for\ntop-down communication, but not much else. Even persona-driven models that\nhelp narrow the ideal experience still run the risk of being overly\nstereotyped. Personalized models assure individual data, including past\ninteractions, is used to create a meaningful employee experience with the\nright messaging and tone, delivered via the right channel.\n\nContextual experience \u2013 serving up the right content at the right time -\nprovides the added benefit of drawing only on _relevant_ work and life events\nfor a hyper-personalized approach. The more contextual, and therefore more\nvaluable to the individual, the more likely the communication will deliver the\ndesired results, for both the employee and the organization.\n\nThe advent of hub technologies, coupled with tailored employer branding and\nback-end analytics, helps both employers and employees stay the course for\nimproved performance and better outcomes for all. As artificial intelligence\nsystems \u201clearn\u201d more about the individual\u2019s preferences (through machine\nlearning), the technology adapts to the personal preferences of the individual\nregardless of the systems running in the background. This is where companies\ncan best adapt their vendor selection strategy: keeping the employee\nexperience relevant while maintaining consistent process flow and metrics.\n\n### **People Analytics: Improving people and business performance**\n\n  \nPeople analytics is now the lifeblood of HR\u2019s role in workforce planning.\nMeasuring and analyzing this slice of \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014data on performance,\ncompensation, demographics, career history, benefits, employee behaviors, time\nutilization, and attrition\u2014can help identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, address recruitment and retention challenges,\ncapture ROI from HR initiatives, and uncover leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nPeople analytics is also collapsing the narrow siloes of talent, benefits,\nwellness, or population health, bringing them all together to intersect and\nimpact the employee experience and benefit the individual.\n\n### **Predictive Analytics: The power of insight**\n\n  \nClosely aligned with people, analytics is the power of looking into the\nfuture: predictive analytics. Workforce data gives HR and business leaders the\nability to make evidence-based decisions to address and improve turnover\ntrends, retain high performers, forecast talent needs, and even anticipate\nlegal risks with poor performers. More the predictive analytics guide the\norganization in selecting and developing its talent, rewards, and HR programs,\nthe better the results for both the company and the individual.\n\nOrganizations that took our [Global Wellbeing\nSurvey](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__content.buck.com_working-2Dwell-2Dglobal-2Dsurvey-2Dof-2Dworkforce-2Dstrategies&d=DwMFaQ&c=9wxE0DgWbPxd1HCzjwN8Eaww1\n--ViDajIU4RXCxgSXE&r=tLT_yNhQo0KunNn7QxL-\nOmi122ic3DN53x7UXHir3Vg&m=jWz9vjRygNrctxedb3c5-_EVz5UZmFQNYTS3WV4A61E&s=eR0oM0adZcs8DigTmnH8fkFVNXRdkQ5wb3oOqQMTjsM&e=)\nreleased earlier this year rated the effectiveness of predictive analytics at\nan incredible 84%. But given the high cost of this investment, it\u2019s critical\nthat HR and IT work together to include a number of scenarios across the full\nrange of business needs, not just predicting isolated hiring and development\nneeds.\n\n### **Cutting through the noise**\n\n  \nThere are many HR technologies and services on the market. It\u2019s critical never\nto lose sight of the goal: technology should be able to help companies \u2013 and\ntheir employees \u2013 make smarter decisions, faster. Administrative platforms\nrunning behind the scenes should have as their goal improving business\ndecisions and corporate outcomes. Employee-facing systems need to support the\nways people actually use their benefits, track progress in meeting their\ncareer goals, and engage with the ways the company bolsters the employee\nexperience across the health, wealth, and career spectrum.\n\n**Learn More:[20 HR Metrics You Need to Track in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/important-hr-\nmetrics/)**\n\nBut there\u2019s never an off-the-rack approach when it comes to engaging with\nemployees, and HR leaders need to evaluate their infrastructure and unique\nchallenges continuously. Each organization has distinct needs that, once\nclearly identified, should point to the technology that will best address\nthose needs.\n\nMany of the conference attendees we met embraced the model of pulling the\nentire HR tech landscape together for the organization, through the powerful\nanalytics tools we\u2019ve been talking about.

For HR in the throes of figuring out the best\ntechnology to use, it\u2019s the only strategy that will pay off.\n\n**Learn More:[7 Sentiment Analysis Tools to Improve Employee Engagement in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/sentiment-\nanalytics-tools-features-price/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Making Sense of HR Tech in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

[Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n**This article is brought to you by[IHRP](https://www.ihrp.sg/).**\n\n### Ong Chin Yin _, Head of People at Grab, speaks to_ Institute for Human\nResource Professionals (IHRP) _on the importance of HR tech and what to take\nnote of when implementing a new system._\n\n### Q Do you think transformation through the adoption of HR tech is\nimportant? Why?\n\nOverall, we believe technology is a critical enabler in delivering better\nexperiences for our people while at the same time redefining the services our\nHR practitioners are able to provide. Here are four key reasons why.\n\nFirst, today's digitally savvy workforce are demanding new personalised\nexperiences. They want similar experiences at their workplace as they do\noutside of it and they expect to be provided personalised information,\ntailored development programmes and flexibility in areas like benefits.\nMoreover, every service should be available from a mobile-first approach.\n\nSecond, automation can help free up our HR teams from mundane, repeatable or\ntransactional tasks, allowing us to spend more time with our Grabbers to solve\nmore strategic issues. For example, the self-service technologies we use -\nsuch as bots - help our Grabbers find answers in an instant, while\nsignificantly reducing email traffic.\n\nThird, in the digital workplace, technology provides employees a greater share\nof voice in defining their own career journey. Today, knowledge sharing and\nlearning are getting more democratised than ever before, as we provide\napplications that allow staff to share, connect and collaborate from their\ndesk or mobile devices.\n\nFourth, every new technology provides some data that can be turned into useful\ninsights through people analytics. At Grab, our people analytics team is on a\njourney towards becoming a customer-centric product development team, putting\npersonalised dashboards and insights in the hands of our HR practitioners and\nbusiness leaders so that we can constantly monitor organisational health and\nproactively evolve it.\n\n### Q How have you adopted or driven the adoption of HR tech in Grab?\n\n> ##### When adopting technology, we ensure three key things - people are at\n> the centre, process takes the back seat; our solutions are purpose-led,\n> never technology-led; and we value progress and agility over perfection.\n\nAs a business, our customers are at the centre of everything we do. The same\nphilosophy applies to our HR teams where our customers are our employees.\nHence, we take an employee-centric approach when looking into new technology\nsolutions for Grabbers, including HR tech.\n\nWhile we embrace new technologies, it is seldom the starting point of solving\nproblems or seizing new opportunities. We see technology as an enabler to\nserving our employees better. Hence, we determine the very best solution that\nis fit-for-purpose for our Grabbers and then carefully evaluate technology\noptions through business case development and cost-benefit analysis.\n\nLastly, at Grab, we create an environment where learning, failing and risk\ntaking is appreciated, and supported with continuous feedback loops. Using\nagile approaches and design thinking, as well as involving our Grabbers from\nthe very start, allows us to prototype, iterate fast and provide more relevant\nsolutions.\n\n### Q What are some of the tech solutions you are adopting now?\n\nWe are currently designing the next version of our performance management\nphilosophy and culture. In line with that, we are developing supporting\ntechnology in-house with our engineering teams that is fit-for-purpose.\n\nWe have also revolutionised our on-boarding programme to offer new joiners a\nmore engaging and enriching experience. This is supplemented with technology\nthat will help them make better connections and guide them through their first\nsix months. A key ingredient to the successful implementation of this are\ndesign thinking sessions and focus groups with new joiners and experienced\nGrabbers.\n\nTo support our extremely flexible benefits programme, which is a rave at Grab,\nwe make use of a system from another Singapore-based start-up which takes away\nthe load of validating and processing the many claims that come through.\n\n### Q What advice do you have for other HR leaders who are also implementing\nsuch tech solutions?\n\nFirst, don\u2019t underestimate the need for change management. Implementing a\ntechnology solution first and trying to drive adoption afterwards bears\nseveral risks such as low ROI or delayed benefit realisation, increased and\nrepetitive user support or even user resistance.\n\nSecond, spending sufficient time with the end-user is key to success.\nListening with an open heart and exhibiting empathy to understand and capture\ntheir needs, as well as bringing them along the journey through proper\ntraining and communication increases the likelihood for sustainable success.\n\nThird, involve IT early to evaluate your technology options carefully. We all\nget excited about new tech and gadgets. Yet, it\u2019s not just about the new\nfeatures but a much broader spectrum of feasibility that requires an IT\nexpert's careful evaluation, especially around information security.\n\nTechnology vendors tend to focus on benefits for the user, while IT can shed\nlight into the integration with your existing application landscape,\ninfrastructure, expected CAPEX and OPEX. Apart from remaining in control of\nyour technology spend, more importantly, you want to maintain your data\nintegrity and data cleanliness, put the right security and controls in place,\nas well as offer efficient support and maintenance services.\n\n* * *\n\n_Ong Chin Yin was recently conferred as an IHRP Master Professional, the\npinnacle-level achievement that recognises HR leaders as role models of the HR\ncommunity._\n\n_With her over 20 years of experience, Ong contributes actively to guiding the\ndevelopment of the national HR certification framework as a second term member\nof the IHRP Professional Practices committee._\n\n_Ong currently runs two teams - people operations (HR), and Grabber Technology\nSolutions (IT) - both with the aim to provide for Grabbers (staff) a more\npositive, personalised experience. _\n\n_In her capacity as Head of People at Grab, Ong leads a combined team of about\n300 members, supporting more than 6,000 employees across eight countries where\nthey have operations and four remote R &D locations._\n\n* * *\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

If\nanything, the disruptions to life, work and people from the continuing\ncoronavirus pandemic are much, much more profound than certainly I, and I\nimagine many of you as well, could have imagined. And with little evidence, at\nleast here in the U.S., that the situation is likely to improve soon (or even\nnot so soon), we are all left to work through a set of circumstances the likes\nof which, let\u2019s admit it, we and our organizational structures and processes\nare almost completely unprepared to navigate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is now almost certain that the coronavirus pandemic will be the defining\nevent for a generation, maybe two generations. There are very few\ntransformative events in a lifetime, the ones that serve as markers or that\ndelineate history and memory and even cultural identity. These events often\ncompel us to recall and describe the world with a new \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d\nframework. Some of these events stand out and endure in our collective memory\nsimply because of the incredible uniqueness and even unexpectedness of the\nmoment. The assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Neil Armstrong setting\nfoot on the surface of the moon in 1969, and I\u2019d even add the explosion of the\nSpace Shuttle Challenger in 1986. We remember and continue to reflect on these\nevents because of their acute emotional impact, and for the fact that, when\nthey occurred, our world, in fact _the_ world, seemed to pause.\n\nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the subsequent fallout from those events\nhave been the global crisis to which the current pandemic has most often been\ncompared. I think in part that comparison is apt. Both situations were, for\nthe most part, completely unsuspected by the average person; both have shaken\nto the foundation our general sense of safety and security (certainly here in\nthe U.S.); and both are particularly unsettling due to a sense of ominous\nuncertainty that surrounded them.\n\nImmediately after Sept. 11, most of us wondered, perhaps even expected, more\nand similar kinds of incidents. Where would the next attack happen? What\nplaces or locations should I avoid? When will it be safe to get on an\nairplane? When will we begin to hold large-scale events like concerts and\nbaseball games again? And on and on. Until, at some point, that feeling began\nto ebb, and it became clear that additional or ongoing significant attacks\nwere unlikely. And life, more or less, went back to \u201cnormal,\u201d or the new\nnormal as it evolved. We eventually felt safe, but for those of us who\nexperienced those years, there was, and remains, a small, deeply held\nrealization that things would never be the same as they once were. As an\naside, just because it popped into my thoughts, while Sept. 11 was not that\nlong ago, there is already an emerging group of young people who have no\npersonal memory of that day and those events. My college student son was all\nof 8 months old on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nLet\u2019s shift the focus to today (and, for the record, I am drafting this piece\non March 20, 2020). The coronavirus pandemic, while sharing some of the\neffects of Sept. 11 (surprise, sudden and dramatic impact, lingering doubt and\ninsecurity as to how long and how deep its impact will turn out to be), is\nalready driving several other, different and, honestly, even more unsettling\neffects on our world and our workplaces.\n\nIt is expected that when new data from the BLS is reported, the pandemic might\nbe the single most devastating job-loss event in our lifetimes. Estimates as\nof today vary widely, but there have been reports suggesting that as many as 5\nmillion workers will either be laid off outright, or placed on an indefinite\nfurlough without pay. The official U.S. unemployment rate as of February 2020\nwas just 3.5%. I read one headline this morning suggesting the rate might\napproach 20% as a result of massive, widespread economic disruption. All of us\nin HR and in HR leadership have been wrestling with the incredibly tight labor\nmarket for much of the last eight or nine years. In about one month, the\npandemic will completely flip that script and change the HR and workplace\nnarrative for who knows how long. Instead of our primary focus being divided\nacross filling open roles, retaining good performers and developing a deep\nleadership bench, many of us will be forced into making hard decisions around\nstaffing levels, reducing workers\u2019 hours and cutting costs wherever and\nhowever possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Sept. 11 was awful, here is just one bit of context to help understand\nhow the comparison of the pandemic to that incident is not a perfect one. At\nthe end of August 2001, just 11 days before the attacks, the unemployment rate\nin the US was 4.9%. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and with\nbusinesses of all kinds facing significant pressure and disruption, as well as\nthe general uncertainty in the world, unemployment began to climb. But the\nrate only reached a post-Sept. 11 high of 6.3% in June of 2003. By August\n2005,the rate had fallen back to the pre-Sept. 11 level of 4.9%, and continued\nto fall from there, bottoming out at 4.4% in May 2007 (after which it began to\nrise once again as the financial crisis was beginning). By most accounts, the\nworkplace and labor-force effects of Sept. 11 were relatively mild and\nrelatively short.\n\nThe workplace and workforce impacts of the pandemic, even the most optimistic\nones, suggest much more adverse and troubling times for workers and\norganizations. It is already happening in the most directly impacted\nindustries\u2014airlines, hotels, restaurants, sports organizations\u2014and it\u2019s\ncertain to trend worse for at least a few months, perhaps many more. As HR and\nbusiness leaders, all eyes will be on us to help our people navigate these\nunprecedented times and uncharted waters. Before the pandemic, it could be\nargued that no role in the organization was more important than HR, since\nhaving the best, most engaged, most empowered people was the only way to\nsucceed in a competitive world. I\u2019d argue that now, HR, and your work, is even\nmore important.\n\nI will close with a quote from author Paulo Coehlo:\n\n\u201cWhen we least expect it, life sets us a challenge to test our courage and\nwillingness to change; at such a moment, there is no point in pretending that\nnothing has happened or in saying we are not ready. The challenge will not\nwait. Life does not look back.\u201d\n\nGood luck to all. Be safe, be well and please take care of each other. It has\nnever mattered more.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-coronavirus-and-the-challenge-to-hr-everywhere%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Steve+Boese%3A+Coronavirus+and+the+challenge+to+HR+everywhere&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-coronavirus-and-the-challenge-to-hr-everywhere%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-coronavirus-and-the-challenge-to-hr-everywhere%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Read on to find out.\n\n![Will it be a good year for HR Tech and Startups in\n2020?](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1578148842/1578148840.jpg)\n\n\u201cIt was a good year.\u201d That\u2019s what most of the HR Tech startups we spoke to\n[opined](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/rewind2019/2019-a-sunny-side-up-\nyear-for-the-hr-tech-\nstartups-24031?utm_source=peoplematters&utm_medium=interstitial&utm_campaign=learnings-\nof-the-day) when they looked back at 2019. From the degree of adoption to the\namount of funds flowing in, the startup space generally saw an increased\nawareness around technology in HR. With the talks of AI, automation,\ntechnology dominating the whole year around, HR Tech saw a definite uptake\nboth in India and globally.\n\nOn this note, what does the year 2020 bode for HR Tech? What are some of the\ntrends that will shape this space in the coming year? We talked to a number of\nstartups in the HR Tech space such as HRIS provider Talbrum, sustainable\ncredit provider SalaryFits, employee experience platform Dockabl, AI-based\none-way video interview platform Talocity, AI-based recruitment startup\nCutShort, Beatest-AI Enabled hiring solution to provide growth potential of\ncandidates for right hiring in an organization, and JobPin that aims to\nsimplify hiring and skilling of the large, young, and ambitious blue and grey\ncollared workforce, among others to understand which way the wind will blow.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say.\n\n### HR Tech implementation to get easier\n\nAs per Vinay Dalal, co-founder of Talbrum, HR tech faces huge delays in number\nof orders versus going live cycle. 2020, therefore, would be a year of\nspecializations and those startups that have entered one industry would\nincreasingly specialize in that industry making order to go live cycle\nsmaller. This would also increase ease for customers in implementation as they\nseek HR specialization more than technology. However, he believes that cost\nsensitivity will be at its peak till Q4 19-20.\n\n### Better solutions to fit employee needs\n\n> \u201cGuilherme Mota, Head of Operations for SalaryFits believes that 2020 will\n> see more of better solutions to fit employee needs instead of just reducing\n> HR's pain only.\u201d\n\nMore than that, he feels dedicated solutions to solve several different needs\nwill emerge- not only for hiring and on-boarding, but also on the aspects of\nengagement, retention, well-being, skills development, leadership.\n\n### Higher tech adoption and growth\n\n\u201cLooking back at our positive experiences in 2019, we are very optimistic\nabout 2020 and strongly believe HR tech in India is entering a golden period\nin terms of growth and securing larger share of investments. We do foresee\nhigher tech adoption, growth, and entry of larger players in the blue-collar\nworker space in India,\u201d stated Sandeep Khomne, Co-founder of Pune based\nJobPin.\n\nSandeep added that the precursors have been Google launching \u2018Jobs\u2019 as part of\nGoogle Pay \u2018Spots\u2019 recently, growth strides made by recent new-age HR tech\nstartups. He believes that productivity and skill challenges are still looming\nissues in India and through strong marketing outreach, there is a natural pull\nthat end-users will follow.\n\n### Increased augmentation of AI analytics\n\nThe most promising and safest prediction in the future of HR Tech is the\nincreased augmentation of AI analytics, states Ketan Dewan, Co-founder & CEO,\nTalocity. Big data is fiercely storming the walls of tech companies which only\nmeans embracing Big Data is and will be the way go and to add value to the\norganization. AI analytics are now more than ever being used in talent\nrecruitment software.\n\nKetan adds that more companies are also beginning to accept the challenge of\nremote employment. The new norm strategy is based more on extracting the best\nefficiency and less about office enclosed space. The management of remote\nworking/ freelancers is, however, not a milk run. It is and will be\nchallenging, but at the same time, it also challenges the distant management\nskills of the manager which leads to the polishing of the company\u2019s HR\ndepartment.\n\nTrends may come and go, but the biggest mistake would be ignoring it.\nLaborious research and understanding of the trends could save you from\ntumbling down the ignorance road. The usage of smart tools is a popular and\nbelievable prediction.\n\n> \u201cNot just for HR Tech startups but the world as a whole is running towards\n> advanced and futuristic tomorrow. Other anticipated trends to settle the air\n> of 2020 include the domination of Artificial Intelligence, change in the\n> workspace environment, workforce diversity, etc.,\u201d adds Ketan.\n\nThe same is opined by Nikunj Verma, founder of CutShort who adds that the\ncurrent trends will continue, meaning there will be a bigger demand for HR\ntech tools. The key will be to win the adoption by solving important problems\nreally well and ensuring adoption hurdles are removed.\n\nCompanies that are able to do this will scale and we are likely to see more\nnumber of investments flowing in from big VCs in HRTech in these leading\nstartups.\n\n### People Analytics will rule\n\nThe next two years would form the trend in taking People analytics to the next\nlevel, believes Sayantan Chatterjee, Founder of Beatest. He adds that\npredictive analysis models to find suitable candidates would focus on Gen-Z\ntalent analytics. The AI processes would be used to remove human biases which\nhave long been a bottleneck in the talent acquisition industry.\nPersonalization even on the application of technology is something that' is\nexpected to grow rapidly in this sector as every organization looks to find\ntheir perfect fit.\n\n### Deep tech product companies will thrive\n\nHighly specialized deep tech product companies focused on the end-user will\nthrive, believes Samarth Masson, Co-founder of Dockabl. He adds that a lot of\narchaic HR processes which have been productized by traditional HR tech\ncompanies will perish.\n\n> \u201cProducts will be built around new disruptive workflows and knowledge which\n> will bring about a big change in the approach to managing people, their\n> performance, transactions, development, progression, engagement etc.\u201d\n\nWe could not agree more!\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HRMS](/category/hr-\ntechnology/HRMS?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=HRMS \"Browse more in:\nHRMS\"),\n[#Outlook2020](/tag/outlook2020?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=outlook2020\n\"Browse more in: Outlook2020\"),\n[#HRTech](/tag/hrtech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hrtech \"Browse more\nin: HRTech\"),\n[#WorkTech](/tag/worktech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=worktech \"Browse\nmore in: WorkTech\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

Read on to find out.\n\n![2019: A sunny-side-up year for the HR Tech\nstartups](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1576137846/1576137844.jpg)\n\nThe last month of the year is to look back and take stock-where did we start\nfrom and where have we reached after 12 long months. And when the startups in\nthe HR Tech space look back, they will mostly say it has been a sunny year.\nFrom the degree of adoption to the amount of funds flowing in, the startup\nspace has generally seen an increased awareness around technology in HR. With\nthe talks of AI, automation, technology dominating the whole year around, HR\nTech saw a definite uptake both in India and globally.\n\nWe talked to a number of startups in the HR Tech space such as HRIS provider\nTalbrum, sustainable credit provider SalaryFits, employee experience platform\nDockabl, AI-based one-way video interview platform Talocity, AI-based\nrecruitment startup CutShort, Beatest-AI Enabled hiring solution to provide\ngrowth potential of candidates for right hiring in an organization, and JobPin\nthat aims to simplify hiring and skilling of the large, young, and ambitious\nblue and grey collared workforce among others.\n\nMajority of the startups agreed that globally as well as in India, there has\nbeen a huge spike in interest and fund flow into the HR Tech space.\n\n### A sunny-side-up year for the HR tech startups\n\nVinay Dalal, co-founder of Talbrum, which provides a low cost yet complete\nfeature HRIS and productivity tracker for MSME industry says that startups\ndepend as much on the product as on the business network of the management\nteam to get into a revenue stream and develop a customer base.\n\n\u201cSo, depending on the product and the business network of the founder some of\nus had an excellent year. Personally we grew thrice over as we started at a\nlower base of users in 2018,\u201d he reveals.\n\n> Guilherme Mota, Head of Operations for SalaryFits believes that year after\n> year we are seeing more \"Tech\" industries bringing innovative solutions for\n> any kind of need, which applies to the HR industry as well.\n\nSimilar thought are essayed by Sandeep Khomne, Co-founder of Pune based\nJobPin, who stated, \u201c2019 has been an exceptional year for startups and\nespecially for JobPin since we entered this space early this year.\u201d\n\nKhomne adds that prior focus, in any kind of HR initiatives, was primarily on\nwhite-collared workers. The last few years have seen a growing focus on the\nblue and grey collared workers, something which is also the need of the hour.\n\n> Samarth Masson, Co-founder of Dockabl, believes that 2019 was the year of\n> specialization with more and more startups picking up a smaller deeper area\n> to build specialized products, rather than building mammoth ERPs.\n\nIn addition, smart technology is fast becoming the new face of business,\nstated Ketan Dewan, Co-founder & CEO, Talocity. Companies and organizations\nare rapidly adopting AI for a stand in the ever-competitive industry. The\nimpact of technology equally touches the department of Human Resource. 2019\nhas witnessed a striking shift from traditional HR methods to AI-automated\nmethods in the HR tech world.\n\n### Aye for AI but adoption, hiring still a concern\n\nLike last year, AI received big thumbs up from both organizations and\nindividuals this year. AI/ML-based jobs were as hot as ever despite general\nindustry hiring remaining a concern\", says Vinay.\n\nNo wonder, tons of solutions for hiring, and again, solutions to solve an HR\npain in the process remained a trend throughout the year as per Guilherme.\n\nSimilarly, adoption like hiring is still a concern.\n\n\u201cMost HR tech startups are struggling with end-user adoption. HR is buying\nproducts but the take up with the end-user or the employee is very low,\u201d\nreveals Samarth.\n\nMeanwhile, trends such as creative job descriptions, optimization of candidate\nprofiles through AI, and lessening of the workforce bias also marked the year\n2019 for HR Tech startups, points out Ketan.\n\n> \u201cOrganizations are using smart AI technologies for automated screening of\n> resumes like never before. While this is also seen as too casual, and too\n> machine-like that it may not give a traditional fair chance to applicants\n> during the whole process, the fact remains that it is fast being adopted by\n> many companies\u201d, adds Ketan.\n\nFurther, he points out that the more we are aware of our biases the more\nlikely we are to address them and try to have it in control. Many\norganizations are beginning to process the hiring process with the best effort\nto keep biases at bay.\n\n> The same is reiterated by Nikunj Verma, founder of CutShort who adds that\n> while talent acquisition remained a tough challenge for small to midsize\n> companies looking for pre-skilled talent, the good news is that after being\n> on the fence for the last couple of years, more companies have started\n> looking at upgrading their talent acquisition with AI tools.\n\n### Challenges Ahead: Education, adoption, investment\n\nWhile the HR world is warming up to HR Tech startups like never before, yet\neducating the market still remains one of the biggest challenges for these\nstartups.\n\n> Guilherme adds, \u201cSometimes I feel the wrong perception of the \"Startup\"\n> concept from big corporates in India is a hindrance. Startups can indeed\n> have scale with technology, but corporates tend to think that all these\n> companies are at an early stage and not ready for the market.\u201d\n\nIn the case of SalaryFits, educating the product about improving financial\ninclusion and financial wellbeing of their employees, a concept which\ncounterparts in the west have been championing as an important part of HR\nspectrum, also took time.\n\nThus fast adoption of technology remains another challenge.\n\n> Sayantan Chatterjee, Founder of Beatest feels that the major conflict in the\n> world of Human Resource is often the human element. While technological\n> advancements have come in leaps and bounds, the perfect confluence of tech\n> and human is yet to be achieved.\n\nAlso, low price points where a certain kind of product players have really\nruined the market by offering really low rates to customers, is another\nchallenge feels Samarth.\n\n\u201cLong sales cycles where the selling remains to be largely relationship-based,\nlack of excellent tech talent that leads to product capability issues in terms\nof security, scalability and bugs, and the fact that most VCs investment\nthesis is now focused on global SAAS where they look for out of India traction\n(mostly US-focused) to seriously consider investments into HR Tech are some of\nthe other challenges,\u201d adds Samarth.\n\nThe capital intensive nature of the B2B2C market is another challenge for HR\nTech startups venturing out.\n\n> \u201cThere is always a chicken and egg problem that any startup needs to solve\n> with regards to proving the right product-market fit and securing an\n> investment. This challenge becomes more difficult to solve in a capital\n> intensive domain,\u201d adds Sandeep of JobPin.\n\nKetan believes that establishing a company culture and spelling out company\npolicies is one challenge all startups face.\n\nHe says, \u201cStarting a company means establishing the company everything from\nscratch, and amongst the most crucial is the company policies. Most startups\nswing with \u201cif it isn\u2019t broken there\u2019s no need of fixing\u201d which results in\ndeeper damage in the future. This is why the proper laying down of policies\nand procedures for a sharp definition is very important. This eliminates the\nthreat of business confusion and workforce panic or mess.\u201d\n\nMost of all, poor company culture will barricade the company from hitting its\nhighest potential and efficiency.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,h_1000/v1576039682/Retro_Colors_Costing_Business_-\n_Infographics_y4kgdt.jpg)\n\nAnd this ability to actually deliver on a tall promise is something all\nstartups face as a challenge, feels Nikunj. Building and scaling, adoption\nissues due to changes needed in a set workflow are barriers in the way of HR\nTech Startups. To add to it, while there is increasing investor interest but\nmany investments are still waiting for more data points.\n\nHence, while all in all, it has been a good year for HR tech startups, with\nthe need for advanced HR software and solutions to satisfy the new age demands\nleading to storming of new ideas, products, and solutions like never before,\nHR Tech startups are still pining for more adoption, more interest by\norganizations, more investor interest as they march into 2020. Will their\nwishes be realized, is something the approaching year will only unfold.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"),\n[#Rewind2019](/tag/rewind2019?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=rewind2019\n\"Browse more in: Rewind2019\"),\n[#HRTech](/tag/hrtech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hrtech \"Browse more\nin: HRTech\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

A panel of experts has been convened to come up with ways for\nhuman resources (HR) professionals to use more technology as they help workers\nand businesses transform.\n\nThe HR Industry Transformation Advisory Panel will also make recommendations\non how to further develop the HR services sector here, Minister of State for\nManpower Zaqy Mohamad announced on Wednesday (May 8).\n\nHR services refers to consultancies, training providers and technology firms,\nwhich can boost the effectiveness and capacity of firms' in-house HR\nprofessionals, Mr Zaqy said at the start of the two-day HR Festival Asia\nconference at Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nHR can go beyond payroll processing and putting up job posts, he said, adding:\n\"In particular, HR tech solutions can minimise many of these transactional HR\ntasks, and free up your bandwidth as HR professionals to do more high touch,\nstrategic work. This includes engaging employees to better understand their\nneeds, concerns and aspirations, and building a strong organisational culture\nthat supports change.\"\n\nTechnology and analytics can also reveal skills and competency gaps that need\nto be addressed for successful business transformation, he added.\n\nHR tech, a US$400 billion industry worldwide, is becoming more accessible and\naffordable. In Singapore, there are close to 200 HR tech firms receiving about\nUS$1.4 billion of funding from private investors, said Mr Zaqy.\n\nThe new panel, convened by the Manpower Ministry (MOM), is co-chaired by the\nministry's deputy secretary for workforce Poon Hong Yuen and Singtel's group\nchief HR officer Aileen Tan. It includes HR and company leaders and\nrepresentatives from the unions and government.\n\nThis builds on the HR Industry Manpower Plan, launched in 2017, under which\nvarious initiatives have been implemented over the past two years such as a\nskills framework and national certification for HR professionals, and a\ndiagnostic tool which companies can use to evaluate their HR processes.\n\nEmployers need to have a mindset shift and be open to building up talent\nrather than just \"buying\" it, said Mr Zaqy. At the same time, workers must be\nopen to learning new skills and embracing new job roles that will boost their\ncareer mobility.\n\nHe said that HR professionals have an important role in understanding\ncompanies' overall workforce needs and optimising staff development efforts\nacross different business units, so that they can help companies build\nstronger, manpower-lean teams to tap new opportunities in Singapore and\nabroad.\n\nSupport for smaller companies to adopt tech solutions is available under the\nSME Start Digital programme, set up by the Infocomm & Media Authority and\nEnterprise Singapore (ESG). Certain banks, telcos and insurance providers\noffer SMEs affordable HR tech solutions, and companies can also tap ESG's\nProductivity Solutions Grant for off-the-shelf HR tech solutions, said Mr\nZaqy.\n\nHe highlighted some companies which have already started using HR tech. One is\nDBS Bank, which uses a recruitment chatbot as well as data analytics to drive\nhiring decisions, so HR staff are able to focus on more strategic functions\nlike talent advisory and candidate sourcing.\n\nSmaller firms are also turning to technology, he said. For example, clothing\nlabel Love, Bonito uses HR tech to outsource the processing of employees'\nmedical claims and provide flexible staff benefits in the form of credits.\n\nMr Zaqy said this has led to better staff welfare, and freed up the people and\nculture team to improve their talent management and development initiatives\nfor their expansion plans.\n\n\"Concerted efforts to redesign jobs, identify and address workforce skills\ngaps, as well as facilitate job transitions, will support inclusive hiring and\nallow workers to be deployed into new and exciting growth areas. Employers\nmust also help their workers manage and build confidence in such change\njourneys,\" he said.\n\nAt the event, six people received Institute for Human Resource Professionals\ncertificates at the Master Professional level - the highest level in the\nnational certification framework.\n\nFifteen companies were recognised as Human Capital Partners, which means they\nhave committed to developing local staff and enjoy benefits when applying to\nthe MOM for foreign worker passes and grants. There are now over 550 such\ncompanies, employing more than 190,000 locals.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [HUMAN RESOURCES](/tags/human-resources)\n  * [TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH](/tags/technology-and-research)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=05/08/2019&title=New panel\nto study ways to boost tech use in HR industry)\n\nPermalink: http://str.sg/oHjJ Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=05/08/2019&title=New\npanel to study ways to boost tech use in HR industry)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=05/08/2019&title=New\npanel to study ways to boost tech use in HR industry)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=new-panel-to-study-ways-to-boost-tech-use-in-hr-\nindustry)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

analyst discussed some of the biggest challenges and\nopportunities in HR technology.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | October 2, 2019 \u2022 4 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bersin-700x467.jpg)\n\nIndustry leader Josh Bersin delivered the opening keynote address Wednesday\nmorning at HR Tech at the Venetian in Las Vegas.\n\nIf HR Tech attendees felt a bit overwhelmed going into the Expo hall with more\nthan 500 exhibitors, Josh Bersin wanted them to know he feels their pain.\n\n\"I've been an analyst in this space for over 20 years, and I have a lot of\nrespect for the vendors in this space, but you as HR leaders have to make\nsense of all this and so many of you have told me there are just so many\noptions,\" said the global industry analyst, who delivered the opening keynote\non the second day of HR Tech.\n\n[**VIDEO: See Josh Bersin 's interview about his report with\n_HRE_.**](https://hrexecutive.com/watch-josh-bersin-talks-hr-tech-trends/)\n\nThe title of Bersin's presentation, \"Untangling the HR Technology Market,\"\nreflects the sheer volume of activity that's been swirling in the space for\nthe past 10 years. Boosted by billions in venture capital funding, the market\nalso reflects the fact that the very nature of work is changing, he said.\n\n\"The job market is hot and yet we also have this problem of lagging\nproductivity,\" said Bersin. \"This gap is getting bigger and it's born by the\nstress, workload, engagement and health and sleep of employees. So there's\nthis huge market for HR tech as wellbeing, engagement, productivity and\nretention become core, rather than nice-to-haves.\"\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: How agile innovated Walmart 's\nhiring**](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-how-agile-innovated-walmarts-\nhiring/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Josh-\nBersin-150x150.jpg)\n\nJosh Bersin\n\nThe latest research shows CEOs are more concerned than ever about growth and\nthat they want more creativity out of their people. \"'Curiosity is actually\nbecoming a competency,\" he said.\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, are very concerned about their jobs and careers.\n\"They're saying 'If I join your company, what am I going to get out of it for\nmy career? And that's created a new demand within the organization for\ncontinuous learning.\"\n\nMost importantly, \"we're not building software for HR anymore\u2014we're building\nit for employees,\" said Bersin. \"If employees don't find it useful, if it\ndoesn't fit into 'the flow of work,' then it's not going to be used.\"\n\n**[More from HR Tech: Follow along here for our ongoing\ncoverage.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)**\n\n**Employee Experience is Primary**\n\nOne of the most fundamental changes in the industry is the primacy of employee\nexperience, said Bersin. \"HR is now the secondary audience\u2014employees are the\nprimary audience. And that's shifted the market.\"\n\nVendors are focusing their attention on \"employee-centric tools\" that operate\nwithin Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Salesforce and other widely used tools, he\nsaid. \"That's the big existential thing the tech community is working on. And\nthat means there are going to be some winners and losers in the marketplace.\"\n\n**[HR Tech 2019: Five key lessons from Barbara\nCorcoran](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-5-hr-lessons-from-barbara-\ncorcoran/)**\n\nThe major vendors are trying to push themselves into the employee experience\ncategory, said Bersin.\n\n\"In the early days when I got into HR tech, there was a very clear strategy\nthat you'd go to ADP, PeopleSoft, and that was it,\" he said. \"Now we're in a\nmuch different situation. HR tech platforms at the core are becoming more like\nyour phone\u2014more like platforms in which you put apps in, and you delete apps.\nIf the apps don't take off, just shut them down. And that's the way the world\nis now\u2014someone's going to build something and you'll say 'My God, we need\nthat.' And you'll try it and it'll be great, or it won't work out and you'll\njust turn it off.\"\n\nOn top of that is the talent space and there \"We have an incredible array of\ntechnologies,\" said Bersin.\n\nTalent management vendors need to keep the following in mind, he said: \"You\nneed to think about not what you think is going to be cool, but what are the\nmanagement philosophies that are trending, and those are growth, development,\njob mobility, highly diverse, highly inclusive talent practices, transparency,\nnetwork effect\u2014those are the things senior leaders are talking about.\"\n\n**AI and Recruiting**\n\nThe area of HR tech that's the most dynamic is recruiting, said Bersin.\n\n\"AI is probably more mature in recruiting than any other part of HR,\" he said.\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: Findings** **from the just-released Sierra-Cedar\nreport**](https://hrexecutive.com/new-sierra-cedar-report-what-should-happen-\nafter-the-hr-tech-buy-in/)\n\nDiversity and inclusion has become so important that's now a significant\nmarket in its own, said Bersin. \"You can now use AI to identify biased\ninterviewing, sourcing and recruiting practices. You can at least see them and\ndo something about them.\"\n\nAI is becoming ubiquitous in HR technology, he said. \"It's hard to build an HR\nplatform of any kind without designing some kind of AI solution. AI is now\ngoing mainstream.\"\n\nVendors like Pymetrics, PhenomPeople, IBM, Oracle, Workday, HireVue are all\nincorporating AI into their products, said Bersin.\n\nFinally, employee experience platforms are big in the HR tech market.\n\n\"Vendors like ServiceNow, Deloitte, Mercer, SAP SuccessFactors, IBM, all have\nplatforms focused on the employee experience,\" he said. \"You can't expect out-\nof-the box ERP to do this. This is going to be a significant market.\"\n\nAndrew R.

But the general definition of the term makes us\nwonder: should we let robots take part in HR processes given that they're not\nhumans? HR experts, including [Secret HR\nSociety](http://www.secrethrsociety.com/) founder Anna Ott, disagree.\n\nSpeaking with [Smart Recruiters](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/anna-\nott-break-everything-and-then-say-sorry/), the chatbot-loving HR director\npointed out that HR people should be \"more disobedient,\" blunt, and bold when\nsuggesting HR tech ideas.\n\n\"We need to spearhead the tech advances that change the way we do our jobs\ninstead of just execute them,\" she said. \"Tech innovation is what keeps HR\nrelevant, so we need to be on the frontline.\"\n\nIf Anna believes tech and HR go hand in hand, then so should all HR people. So\nwhat are the next big things in the industry this year? We round up the top HR\ntech 2020 to give your business a competitive advantage.\n\n## Analytics With AI\n\nThere are many ways to incorporate this technology into your HR processes.\nWith the help of artificial intelligence, you can easily roll out surveys and\nrequest feedback from employees. If you want to track trends within the\norganization and record vital metrics, you can make use of [augmented\nanalytics](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/augmented-analytics) forms\nthat combine the power of machine learning (ML) and natural language\nprocessing (NPL) to generate data easily from your targets.  \n\n## Cloud-Based HR\n\nCloud-based HR is the future of resource of management, whether a company\nemploys remote or office-based teams. From [software tools that manage the\npayroll](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/246735/20200103/hr-\ntrends-2020-best-payroll-software-to-use-depending-on-your-business-size.htm)\nto smart platforms that connect candidates to employers, there are a plethora\nof [HR tech tools ](https://www.monterail.com/blog/75-hr-tech-tools-for-your-\nbusiness)you can use to optimize and streamline your processes.\n\nSEE ALSO: HR Trends 2020: Best Payroll Software to Use Depending on Your\nBusiness Size\n\n## Data Security\n\nWith the rise of online-based HR tools and self-serving platforms comes the\ngrowing concern for data security. This 2020, businesses must ensure that\ntheir data security is in place and accordance with data protection laws, such\nas the [GDPR](https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-\ncompanies).\n\n## Employee Wellness\n\nIt's [no secret](https://www.wsj.com/articles/healthy-workers-are-more-\nproductive-study-finds-1502219651) that the more mentally and physically\nactive an employee is, the more productive and high-performing he or she\nbecomes at work. Also, according to\n[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2018/06/24/how-can-\nworkplace-design-help-mental-health/#627e91e64dc1), the way we design\nworkplaces support employees' mental health and wellbeing.\n\nApart from ensuring your office is pleasing to the eyes and has the right\nelements to increase productivity levels, you can use software and tech tools\nto engage your people in wellness activities. One good example is\n[Lantern](https://golantern.com/), an app featuring tools that help fight\nanxiety and depression.\n\n## Remote Working\n\nIn recent years, [remote working](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/70-percent-\nof-people-globally-work-remotely-at-least-once-a-week-iwg-study.html) has\ntaken the HR industry by storm and for a lot of good reasons. But while this\nsetup has plenty of perks for employees, it also poses major management\nchallenges for the HR department. Luckily, technology has its ways of solving\nHR problems. There are platforms that allow you to recruit people from the\nother side of the globe, [software ](http://www.vudream.com/top-7-business-\nconference-apps-virtual-reality-vr/)that makes face-to-face conversations\npossible, and more.\n\n### Wrap Up\n\nWhile all these HR tech 2020 trends look promising, it's never a good habit to\nfollow trends blindly. Remember that there's not a one-size-fits-all approach\nto anything, so be sure to make the most of your current systems and focus on\nbuilding strategic plans to improve your HR processes.\n\n[RELATED LINK: Tech Trends 2020: Top New Technology Trends That Will Drive\nBusinesses Forward in\n2020](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/246695/20191230/tech-trends-2020-top-\nnew-technology-trends-that-will-drive-businesses-forward-in-2020.htm)\n\n__TAG\n\n[HR Trends](/tags/hr-trends), [HR Tech Trends](/tags/hr-tech-trends)\n\n\u24d2 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Attracting new talent,\ndeveloping employees\u2019 peak potential and improving the work experience through\nautomation are the top goals for employees implementing new technologies,\naccording to PwC.\n\n\u201cEmployers are looking to invest in the strategic side of HR,\u201d says Dan\nStaley, HR technology leader with PwC. \u201cFifty-six percent of those surveyed\nsay they are going to increase investments in finding, attracting and\nretaining talent.\u201d\n\nA decade ago, HR tech was lagging in adapting to new technologies, but today,\nHR cloud solutions are a $148 million market. About 74% of companies surveyed\nby PwC are planning to increase their spending in HR tech this year in order\nto address their main talent needs. Employers are expected to make investments\nin talent acquisition (49%), improved user experience for employees (48%) and\nskills mapping and career path tools (46%).\n\n\u201cTechnology in the HR space is used by every employee, which makes it a little\nbit different than other domains\u201d Staley says. \u201cIn terms of the employee\nexperience and developing talent, it really comes down to giving and getting\nfeedback.\u201d\n\nDiversity and inclusion is one area where improvements in HR tech can benefit\nemployee recruitment and retention to make sure the organization isn\u2019t being\nbiased during the hiring process, Staley says.\n\n\u201cThe recruiting tools that are out there today are designed to remove the bias\nin interviewing,\u201d he says. \u201cEmployers can have AI involved in video-based\ninterviewing, which takes into account how candidates answer the questions and\nrender a score of what the fit is, in an effort to take out any human bias.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, for internal promotions, having a platform where employees can\nupdate their skills and goals, keeping them current, will give managers a\nbetter idea of where to go when it comes to promoting from within the\norganization or making other structural and talent changes.\n\nBut getting employees to use these tools can be a challenge:about 82% of those\nsurveyed say they struggle with adoption challenges, and lack of preparation,\nnot meeting user needs, unclear user benefits, and poor user experiences are\nsome of the reasons survey respondents believe these technologies aren\u2019t\nembraced.\n\nWhile traditional training methods are not enough to improve adoption rates,\nincentives and gamification can be effective tools, according to PwC. Indeed,\nthese two techniques were rated the most effective methods to combat low\nadoption.\n\n\u201cUnderstand the business problem you\u2019re trying to solve with the technology\nand that you\u2019re talking to line managers and employees to make sure you are\nsolving a real problem when you roll the tech out. That will help with the\nadoption and the disconnect,\u201d Staley says.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b4c165/2147483647/strip/true/crop/195x195+7+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcb%2Fb0%2F9f870dfd44e19e452df9fe002101%2Fsourcemedia.brightspotcdn-1.jpg)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/amanda-schiavo)\n\n[Amanda

The Series B round -- which moves the\nfirm\u2019s total raise to $19.7 million -- was led by Sequoia India and saw\nparticipation from existing investors Lightspeed India Partners, Endiya\nPartners and 3one4 Capital.\n\nMore than 200 firms -- including giants such as adtech firm [InMobi,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/inmobi) fintech startup [Paytm,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/paytm) drink conglomerate Bisleri,\nautomobile maker Mahindra, Kotak group and delivery firms Swiggy and\nMilkbasket -- use Darwinbox\u2019s HR platform to serve half a million of their\nemployees in 50 nations, Rohit Chennamaneni, co-founder of [Darwinbox,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/darwinbox) told TechCrunch in an\ninterview.\n\nThe startup, which competes with giants such as SAP and [Oracle,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle) said its platform enables a high\nlevel of configurability and ease of use, and understands the needs of modern\nemployees. \u201cThe employees today who have grown accustomed to using consumer-\nfocused services such as Uber and Amazon are left disappointed in their\nexperience with their own firm\u2019s HR offerings,\u201d said Gowthami Kanumuru, VP\nMarketing at Darwinbox, in an interview.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s HR platform offers a range of features, including the ability for\nfirms to offer their employees insurance and early salary as loans. Its\nplatform also features social networks for employees within a company to\nconnect and talk, as well as an AI assistant that allows them to apply for a\nleave or set up meetings with quick voice commands from their phone.\n\n\u201cThe AI system is not just looking for certain keywords. If an employee tells\nthe system he or she is not feeling well today, it automatically applies a\nleave for them,\u201d she said.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s platform is built to handle onboarding new employees, keep a tab\non their performance, monitor attrition rate and maintain an ongoing feedback\nloop. Or as Kanumuru puts it, the entire \u201chiring to retiring\u201d cycle.\n\nOne of Darwinbox\u2019s clients is L&T, which is tasked with setting up subways in\nmany Indian cities. L&T is using Darwin's geo-fencing feature to log the\nattendance of employees. \u201cThey are not using biometric punch machine that is\ntypically used by other firms. Instead, they just require their 1,200\nemployees to check-in from the workplace using their phones,\u201d said Kanumuru.\n\n![darwinbox event](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/darwinbox_event.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, Darwinbox is largely focusing on serving companies based in Asia\nas it believes Western companies\u2019 solutions are not a great fit for people\nhere, said Kanumuru. The startup began courting clients in Southeast Asian\nmarkets last year.\n\n\u201cOur growth is a huge validation for our vision,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin six months\nof operations, we had the delivery giant [Delhivery\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/delhivery) with over 23,000 employees\nuse our platform.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, Dev Khare, a partner at [Lightspeed\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial) Venture, said,\n\u201cthere is a new trend of SaaS companies targeting the India/SE Asia markets.\nThis trend is gathering steam and is disproving the conventional wisdom that\nAsia-focused SaaS companies cannot get to be big companies. We firmly believe\nthat Asia-focused SaaS companies can get to large impact value and become\nlarge and profitable. Darwinbox is one of these companies.\u201d\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s Chennamaneni said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand\nits footprints in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other Southeast Asian\nmarkets. Darwinbox also will expand its product offerings to address more of\nemployees\u2019 needs. The startup is also looking to make its platform enable\ntasks such as booking of flights and hotels.\n\nChennamaneni, an alum of [Google ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/google)\nand McKinsey, said Darwinbox aims to double the number of clients it has in\nthe next six to nine months.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "[Funding alert] HRtech startup Zimyo raises undisclosed funding from Yatra Angel Network - YourStory", "link": "https://yourstory.com/2020/01/funding-hrtech-fintech-startup-zimyo-yatra-angel-network", "guid": "CAIiEJqt-nQB7YXnTvIItsVygZIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow6-iECzC_7YEDMIfQhAY", "pubdate": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2020/01/funding-hrtech-fintech-startup-zimyo-yatra-angel-network\" target=\"_blank\">[Funding alert] HRtech startup Zimyo raises undisclosed funding from Yatra Angel Network</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">YourStory</font>", "source": "YourStory", "body": "[![](/logos/logo_yourstory.svg)](/)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_search_new.svg)](/search/)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_notification_new.svg)](/notifications)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_bookmark_new.svg)](/me/bookmarks)\n\n[![](/logos/logo_yourstory.svg)](/)\n\n![](/icons/ic_overflow_menu.svg)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_search_new.svg)](/search)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil)[\u0905](/hindi)[\u0c85](/kannada)\n\n[YourStory](/)[Academy](https://offer.yourstory.com/the-funding-course-\nfacebook)[HerStory](/herstory)[SocialStory](/socialstory)[SMBStory](/smbstory)[YourStoryTV](/videos)\n\nMore![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[Awards](/awards/50-disruptive-startups-of-india-2019)[Advertise With\nUs](https://share.hsforms.com/1pqFuZ_AaRMa4bw6jAcPFAQ3xg7b)[AutoStory](/automotive)[MyStory](/mystory)[Weekender](/weekender)[Journal](/journal)[YS\nKorea](/korea)[Deutschland](/deutschland)[Germany](/germany)[Events](https://events.yourstory.com)[Visual](https://visual.yourstory.com)\n\nLanguage![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[English](/)[Kannada](/kannada)[Hindi](/hindi)[Tamil](/tamil)[Asamiya](/asamiya)[Bangla](/bangla)[Gujarati](/gujarati)[Malayalam](/malayalam)[Marathi](/marathi)[Odia](/odia)[Punjabi](/punjabi)[Telugu](/telugu)[Urdu](/urdu)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil \"Tamil\")[\u0905](/hindi \"Hindi\")[\u0c85](/kannada \"Kannada\")\n\nLogin![profile_placeholder](/icons/ic_profile.svg)\n\nLanguage![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[English](/)[Kannada](/kannada)[Hindi](/hindi)[Tamil](/tamil)[Asamiya](/asamiya)[Bangla](/bangla)[Gujarati](/gujarati)[Malayalam](/malayalam)[Marathi](/marathi)[Odia](/odia)[Punjabi](/punjabi)[Telugu](/telugu)[Urdu](/urdu)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil \"Tamil\")[\u0905](/hindi \"Hindi\")[\u0c85](/kannada \"Kannada\")\n\nLogin![profile_placeholder](/icons/ic_profile.svg)\n\n  * [Funding](/category/funding)\n\n# [Funding alert] HRtech startup Zimyo raises undisclosed funding from Yatra\nAngel Network\n\nThe startup plans to utilise the funds to further develop its product\nofferings and to scale into multiple diversified platforms.\n\nBy [Tarush Bhalla](/author/tarush-bhalla)\n\n14th Jan 2020\n\n  * +0 \n\n![](/icons/ic_clap.svg)\n\n  * ![](/icons/ic_bookmark.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_share_whiteBG.svg)\n\nShare on\n\n![close](/icons/ic_cross.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_facebook_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_twitter_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_linkedin_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_whatsapp_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_share_whiteBG.svg)\n\n  * ![](/icons/ic_facebook_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_twitter_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_linkedin_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_whatsapp_v2.svg)\n\n  * +0 \n\n![](/icons/ic_clap.svg)\n\n  * ![](/icons/ic_bookmark.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_share_whiteBG.svg)\n\nShare on\n\n![close](/icons/ic_cross.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_facebook_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_twitter_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_linkedin_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_whatsapp_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_share_whiteBG.svg)\n\n  * ![](/icons/ic_facebook_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_twitter_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_linkedin_RedBG_v2.svg)\n  * ![](/icons/ic_whatsapp_v2.svg)\n\nShare on\n\n![close](/icons/ic_cross.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_facebook_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_twitter_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_linkedin_RedBG_v2.svg)\n\n![](/icons/ic_whatsapp_v2.svg)\n\nZimyo, an HRtech startup, on Monday said that it has raised an undisclosed\namount of funding from Yatra Angel Network.

Digital Transformation. Innovation Mindsets.\nOrganisational Culture. These are much more than just buzzwords and catch-\nphrases for the modern HR professional navigating the workforce evolution in\nAsia-Pacific in 2020. Rather, they are specific challenges and opportunities;\nindustry-wide ambitions and business risks \u2013 all at the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex business environment, and HR professionals need to guide their\norganisations through the storms of continuous change. They need to be at the\ntop of their game, constantly adding value and building the long-term\ncapabilities of their workforces.\n\nThe carefully curated content behind the **HR Tech Festival Asia** conference\nprogramme is designed to help the workforce leaders of today achieve exactly\nthese goals and more. With some of the world\u2019s foremost minds on management,\ndigital disruption, and HR technology, alongside the best of the Asia-Pacific\nregion\u2019s local case studies and practical advice, the stage is set for the\nbiggest HR Tech Festival ever hosted in 2020.\n\n**Manpower policies unpacked**\n\nThe event is also supported by a wide range of public sector organisations\nfrom markets throughout the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nregion.

But there are a whole\nhost of factors that are sending ripples of change through companies as we\nspeak.\n\nGeneration Z is shaping businesses. Employers recognize the importance of\nemployee wellbeing, and the use of AI-enabled machines is seeping into all\nareas of business decision-making.\n\nWe\u2019ve come up with the top 5 HR tech trends to help see off the rest of the\nyear and give companies plenty to think about as they welcome 2020.\n\n## **#1 Using AI in recruitment**\n\nAI, or Artificial Intelligence, has been a hot topic for a while. Any company\nwishing to remain competitive, at the forefront of technology, and with the\nvery best systems in place will be considering AI as a critical part of their\nstrategy.\n\nIf you are applying to work for a large company, your job application will\nprobably be filtered and reviewed by an algorithm. [AI is set to dominate HR\nrecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/how-to-succeed-with-ai-in-recruiting/) for more companies in\nthe coming years. Algorithms are being used to pre-screen, select, and even\nprovide feedback to applicants.\n\n## **#2 Enhancing Employee Wellbeing with Systems**\n\nBurnout, stress, and mental health issues are an issue in the workplace. A\nGallup study of 7,500 workers conducted in 2018 found that 23% felt very often\nor always burned out at work. These statistics are indicative of the scale of\nthe problem.\n\nOf course, people who feel overworked are often less productive. Yet there are\nother impacts, including increased time off work, and employee churn.\n\nCompanies are beginning to utilize everything from gamification and wearables\nto digital cognitive-behavioral therapy tools to support employees and help\nthem get back on track. Algorithms, using machine learning, are also being\nused for employee management. For example, algorithms can help identify who is\nat risk of leaving the company, and approaches that can be undertaken to help\nretain their best employees.\n\n## **#3 Working Remotely and The Gig Economy**\n\nOne approach that companies are implementing to make themselves more\nattractive for employees and offer the best work-life balance is a work from\nhome policy. Once either impractical or a one-off luxury, companies are\nstarting to see the multiple benefits of [out-of-office\nworking](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/work-from-\nhome-week-initiatives-help-manage-remote-workers-better/).\n\nTechnology such as\n[VoIP](https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/office/features/voip/overview.html) and\nthe internet has allowed for these shifts. In addition to allowing office-\nbased employees the odd day working from home, companies are hiring remote\nworkers working from multiple static (dedicated) IP addresses.\n\nA key motivation for considering this split workforce is the rapid increase in\nthe gig economy. This option of quickly hiring freelancers enables companies\nto scale rapidly as demand increases. Allowing for a workforce of both remote\nand office-based workers will require companies to install efficient\ntechnology and undertake training to manage remote teams. Otherwise, this can\nbecome a potentially chaotic business structure.\n\n## **#4 Using Cloud-Based HR**\n\nOnline HR software has resulted in improvements in how teams are managed. A\ncloud-based platform allows HR employees to work with real-time data. Most\nplatforms enable you to manage tasks like payroll, recruitment, onboarding,\ntime-management, and benefits. With platforms being scalable, they can\naccommodate businesses of all sizes.\n\nSuch platforms can offer useful insights, some of which were touched on\nearlier. Fundamentally, HR software provides a support team with more data at\ntheir hands so they can make better-informed decisions regarding employee\nmanagement.\n\nAutomatic software updates are particularly beneficial for HR compliance. As\nprofessional vendors support cloud-based solutions, the relevant applications\nare frequently updated based on current regulations.\n\n**Learn More:[Employee Health Benefits Evolve Amidst New Regulations for\nICHRAs in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-\nbenefits/employee-health-benefits-evolve-amidst-new-regulations-for-ichras-\nin-2020/)**\n\n## **#5 Implementing Technologies to Win Over Generation Z**\n\nHot on the tails of millennial employees is their younger siblings, Generation\nZ. And with them comes a wealth of digital knowledge. Whereas previous\ngenerations partly acquired their digital skills within the workplace,\ncompanies now need to guarantee usable technologies to attract and maintain\nthis tech-savvy generation.\n\nCompanies should look to sharpening their online brand presence and\nreputation. A LinkedIn survey found [71% of\nrecruiters](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-\nsolutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/ultimate-list-of-employer-brand-stats.pdf)\nagreed that brand reputation was a significant factor in attracting top\ntalent. Although relevant to the entire workforce, as Generation Z are both\ndigital natives and the new talent pool, companies should be taking action to\naccommodate for this.\n\nEmployees may want to consider checking company review sites, polishing an\nonline presence, and using sleek, hyper-targeted social ads to reach the right\npeople. Employee advocacy is also paramount here. Using social media and tools\nsuch as LinkedIn Elevate will help measure employee communication and\ninteraction regarding a company brand.\n\n**Learn More:[The Future of Remote Work in 2020 and Beyond: 8 Tips for\nHR](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/future-of-remote-\nwork-tips-for-hr/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Top+5+HR+Tech+Trends+to+Look+Out+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+5+HR+Tech+Trends+to+Look+Out+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Top 5 HR Tech Trends to Look Out in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

The fact that we have clean water,\nelectricity and I'm writing this while a robot vacuums my living room and\ntorments my cats means that my life is more comfortable and safe than my\nancestors' lives.\n\nBut, technology doesn't make everything better, and there are limits,\nespecially in the area of Human Resources. While HR Tech is always a hot topic\nof conversation in the Human Resources space and something businesses should\nbe focusing on.\n\nSo this year at [Unleash World in Paris](https://unleashgroup.io/), I spoke\nwith several HR Tech companies about the problems they are looking to solve.\nHere's what they said.\n\n **Problem:  **Employee satisfaction and turnover.\n\n **Solution from  **Klil Nevo, Managing Director of Customer Success at [Juno\nJourney](https://www.junojourney.com/):\n\nMillennials today are looking for personal development as well as career\nopportunities. We offer a tailor-made career map based on skills and tasks\nbacked with personalized learning that results in prediction for internal\nmobility and growth in your organization.\n\n **Problem:** Stress and Tension\n\n **Solution from  **Eric Woehrling: Finance Director Pacla Medical -With\n[BackHug](https://www.mybackhug.com/):\n\nPressure point massage. We install for free in offices, factories, and gyms--\nanywhere there are lots of people with tension and people book sessions on the\ndevice with our app just like an Uber, and they pay when they operate.\n\n **Problem:** The Talent Experience\n\n **Solution from  **Brad Goldoor: Chief People Office [Phenom\nPeople](https://www.phenompeople.com/):\n\nWe solve the talent experience problem by offering superior interfaces in user\ninterface and user experience. We take that data and reduce time and cost per\nhire and as well as increase quality.\n\n **Problem:  **Employee coaching\n\n **Solution from  **Ozlem Sarioglu, Co-Founder of\n[SparkUs](https://www.sparkus.com/):\n\nWe are about bringing coaching to more people. There are limited resources\nthat restrict coaching services to a few select people in an organization.\nWith SparkUs, we provide a self-directed coaching platform, creating a safe\nspace for people to think about themselves--reflect on what they are doing,\nexplore, and follow-through. Then the human element, like a coach, manager, or\nmentor, comes into play to fine-tune and deepen the experience.\"\n\n **Problem:  **Hiring Computer Engineers\n\n **Solution from:  **Aude Barral Cofounder\n[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/start):\n\nThe tech market hiring market is very tense, and it's becoming increasingly\ndifficult for companies to find developers to hire. Here at Codingame, we\nprovide recruiters with an all in one tech recruiting platform to source,\nscreen, and retain the best developers And our main asset is that we do it\nthrough gamification. We provide gamified assessment tests that engage\ndevelopers in a different way and totally disrupt the way companies hire\nthem.:\n\n **Problem:  **Agility\n\n **Solution from  **Phillippe Pinault: CEO\n[holaSpirit](https://www.holaspirit.com/):\n\nThe problem is being agile at scale. When you grow a company, you like to grow\nand be still agile. Being agile when you are ten people is easy; being agile\nwhen you are 1000 is much more difficult. It meets new ways of management. We\nbring more clarity and transparency to who is doing what. We help distribute\nthe authority within the organization.\n\n **Problem:  **Email Flooding\n\n **Solution from  **Benoit Renoul: Head of Marketing\n[Talkspirit](https://www.talkspirit.com/):\n\nOur platform centralizes all the exchange of information and documents and\nprojects inside the company. New employees have instant access to all the\nprojects that they are involved in and don't need to exchange multiple emails\nwith all the existing employees. It allows them to access information\nthemselves without extensive training. There is a search engine that allows\nthem to access all the information they need.\n\n **Problem:  **Building an alumni network\n\n **Solution from  **Roman Vovk: Business Development Manager and Charlotte\nSault Head of International Marketing & Alumni Relations\n[IntraWorlds](https://www.intraworlds.com/):\n\nWe take a modern approach to the talent life cycle. We recognize that talent\nmanagement starts before, during, and after employment. We know that\nmillennials are moving jobs quicker than ever and no longer stay with firms\nfor decades. We help companies stay connected with former employees with a\ntalent-centric approach to help them reach their business objectives\n\n **Problem:  **Time consuming interviews\n\n **Solution from  **Adam Gretton Sales Manager, UK and Brian Morris Regional\nSales Manager Switzerland, [Sonru](https://www.sonru.com/):\n\nThe problem is it's too time-consuming, and companies have too many\ncandidates, and there is too much time spent scheduling interviews. These\ntelephone interviews are inconsistent. The name comes from the Irish to stand\nout, and we are designed to help candidates stand out by bringing their CV to\nlife. Cvs are not good predictors of job performance. The predictive validity\nof a telephone interview is .36 (36 percent of the time your decision based on\nthat was correct), and with a video interview, it's .51. Industry analysts\nfrom Gartner highlighted video interviewing as high current importance and\nhigh future relevance. So it will become a lot more mainstream.\n\nPublished on: Nov 13, 2019\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from

What is\noften forgotten is the fact that some of the best startups in the world solve\nthe simplest of problems.\n\nThis is exactly the approach that Pascal Henry, who is the CEO and cofounder\nof [HReasily](https://www.hreasily.com/), took when he identified the\nfundamental needs of rapidly growing SMEs\u2013to manage their human resources more\nefficiently.\n\nHenry launched his Singapore-based HR firm in late 2015 as a [Software-as-a-\nService](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/19/the-top-\nthree-2019-saas-trends-and-how-theyre-changing-it-management/#154f808c71bc)\n(SaaS) business that enables companies to increase productivity by using\ntechnology to streamline traditional processes such as payroll processing,\nleave management and expense claims.\n\n**\u201c** When I was running my first startup in Singapore, I had to do a lot of\nthe manual processes myself. I felt the pain and the drain of it,\u201d explains\nHenry. \u201cIt was taking up a lot of my time and energy, when I should have been\nfocusing on building my business.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Asia](https://www.forbes.com/asia)\n\n  * [\n\n### Mi 10 Pro Review: Xiaomi\u2019s First True Premium Flagship\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2020/04/08/mi-10-pro-review-xiaomis-\nfirst-true-premium-flagship/)\n\n  * [\n\n### To Prevent Global Depression, Governments Must Act Soon\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yuwahedrickwong/2020/04/07/to-prevent-global-\ndepression-governments-must-act-soon/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Pandemic To Quicken Supply Shift From Mainland China, Benefit Taiwan R&D\n-- Amcham Taipei\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2020/04/07/pandemic-to-\naccelerate-supply-shift-from-mainland-china-benefit-taiwan-amcham-taipei/)\n\n **Improving productivity and efficiency**\n\nHReasily\u2019s mission is simple: To innovate and automate HR throughout the\nworld. As one of the fastest-growing cloud-based [HR SaaS\ncompanies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/07/18/the-hr-software-\nmarket-reinvents-itself/#e9e77df5d0af) in the region, their simple modules and\nfeatures aim to transform many of the legacy HR processes and automate them to\nbe accessible anytime and anywhere. Currently the company offers seven modules\nincluding payroll, staff leave, employee contracts and attendance. As HReasily\ngrows, it continues to add product lines aimed at empowering companies to\nscale faster.\n\nPreviously, many businesses used solutions that each looked after a particular\nsilo of an HR department. So you\u2019d have one system to manage your payroll\ncalculations, one for leave and others for other functions.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was you had to log in and out of many various systems, and\nthese systems cost a huge amount of money,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is\nbuild a solution that is very affordable that integrates with all the\nfunctions on a unified platform.\u201d\n\n**A simple but elegant business model**\n\nHReasily runs a [subscription-based revenue\nmodel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/12/whats-behind-\nthe-rise-of-the-subscription-model/#56543b1e35c3). Starting with payroll,\nwhich is at the core of every traditional HR office, the company offers\npremium versions that run on monthly or yearly subscriptions, with add-on\nmodules available such as staff leave and time attendance. This past summer at\nthe [RISE 2019 conference](https://riseconf.com/) in Hong Kong, Henry and his\nteam unveiled their latest benefits management module which will soon allow\ncustomers to acquire group level insurance, healthcare and even apply for\ncredit cards or loans.\n\nHReasily says its competitive advantage lies in its customer base, which is\nmostly SMEs. By initially focusing on the fundamental needs of this particular\nsegment, the company has earned the support of larger banking and government\nagencies and has become known as an \u201cSME champion.\u201d Not surprisingly, as the\ncompany has grown it says that it began to attract larger corporations,\npublicly listed companies, multinational corporations and even payroll\noutsourcing firms.\n\n\u201cAs we grew we acquired a more diverse customer base,\u201d Henry says, \u201cbecause a\nlot of larger companies are tired of the older and expensive solutions because\nthey need to be installed on premise and they require a refresher every year\nwhen rules and regulations change.\u201d\n\n**Partnerships are the key to rapid growth**\n\nBeing based in Singapore has allowed HReasily to capitalize on the rapid\ngrowth in[ Southeast\nAsia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vinnielauria/2019/05/14/big-upsurge-in-e-\ncommerce-drives-southeast-asias-online-economy/#77c08fc83309). SME\u2019s account\nfor 97% of all the enterprises in the region, and employ half of the\nworkforce, according to data from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\nHReasily\u2019s growth has been nothing short of impressive. With nearly 30,000\ncompanies on their platform and more than 100 new companies onboarding every\nday, HReasily is said to be growing rapidly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSome of HReasily\u2019s notable customers include Love Bonito (in Singapore,\nIndonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong), Sambat Finance (Cambodia), OnlinePajak\n(Indonesia) and TechInAsia. As the company looks to complete their coverage of\nAsia, the next major market they look to tackle is mainland China followed by\nTaiwan, Japan, Myanmar and Australia.\n\nInvestors have taken notice of the company\u2019s growth as well. Fresh off a pre-\nseries A [funding\nround](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hreasily-receives-\nus-5-million-investment-from-envy-capital-1028514742) of $5 million from Envy\nCapital, HReasily is currently estimated to be valued at more than $100\nmillion. Henry admits that the company\u2019s rapid growth in the region has only\nbeen possible with the early support from their key strategic partners.\n\nHReasily has been working with Citibank, Mazars and Stripe. The partnership\nwith [Mazars](https://www.mazars.co.th/Home/News/Mazars-in-the-press/Mazars-\ndevelops-its-digital-services-with-HReasily), which was a lead investor from\nthe startup\u2019s first round of funding, gives them access to a global audit,\nadvisory and payroll outsourcing firm with 300 offices in 100 countries. Henry\nsays it allows HReasily to localize its solutions to each individual market.\n\n**\u201c** Today, building a solid ecosystem of strategic partners is very\nimportant because you come from different angles, but you all serve one\ncustomer, which is the SME or the business,\u201d says Henry. \u201cBy coming together,\nwe collectively create a great end-to-end experience for them. There\u2019s\nstrength in numbers.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jaykimmer) or\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykimmer).

into tools that provide\nactionable insights for better talent engagement.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 15, 2019\n\nTopics:

including local startups, are\nintensely competing to leverage the increased adoption of digital HR systems\nby enterprises in Singapore.\n\nAccording to the newly-released Singapore HRTech Market Map (2019), there is a\nsignificant trend of HR technologies moving away from being just compliance-\ndriven systems to tools that provide actionable insights for better talent\nengagement.\n\nThe market map is a collaboration between hrtech.sg, a Singapore-based\nboutique HR technology advisory and analyst firm, and HR technology blogger\nAdrian Tan.\n\nThe market map divides service providers across seven major segments:\n\n  * **Talent Acquisition** (employer branding, recruitment)\n  * **Talent Engagement** (employer onboarding, performance management)\n  * **Talent Rewards** (compensation & benefits)\n  * **Talent Development** (training)\n  * **Talent Analytics**\n  * **Talent Operations** (automation & shared services)\n  * **Human Resource Management Systems**\n\n\u201cThere are two key factors for the rapid growth of HR technology players\nservicing the Singapore talent marketplace. Firstly, the productivity focus of\nthe Singapore government is nudging enterprises to adopt digital HR systems\nfaster and better,\" said Tan.\n\n\"Second, enterprises are increasingly feeling the need to better engage with\ntheir employees, more specifically millennials, to recruit and retain them,\u201d\nhe added\n\n\u201cThe really hot areas in HR technology seems to be talent acquisition and\ntalent engagement, considering that over 50% of the players are present in\nthis segment, said Sriram Iyer, CEO of hrtech.sg.\n\n\"Enterprises are investing in new technologies that can automate the mundane\nand repeatable tasks and enable the HR teams to focus on higher order employee\nengagement.\"\n\nCheck out the map below (click through for full-size):\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HR-TECH-Market-\nMap-2019.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HR-TECH-Market-\nMap-2019.jpg)\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fmore-\nthan-160-hr-tech-providers-active-singapore%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=More+than+160+HR+tech+providers+active+in+Singapore&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fmore-\nthan-160-hr-tech-providers-active-singapore%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fmore-\nthan-160-hr-tech-providers-active-singapore%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Boese recently spoke at the [HR Technology Conference\nin Las Vegas](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/).

He can be\nemailed at sboese@lrp.com._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/80647464_m.jpg)\n\nOver the last several months, I\u2019ve been focusing on the planning, execution\nand post-event activities for the recently concluded HR Technology Conference,\nwhich, by all accounts, was our largest and most successful event ever. It\u2019s\nonly in the last week or two that I\u2019ve had a chance to reflect on the\nconference\u2014and on the year overall\u2014thinking about the technologies and trends\nthat have mattered the most in 2019 and speculating on what might dominate the\nconversations in 2020. Here\u2019s my semi-scientific look at what was important to\nthe HR-tech community this year, and what we will probably spend more time on\nin 2020.\n\n**2019**\n\n**AI Tools Maturing**\n\nAI in HR tech was probably the No. 1 tech topic and trend in 2019. There were\nabout 500 exhibitors at HR Tech, and I bet easily over 100 of them are\ndeveloping, deploying, or at least discussing, how AI is driving their\ntechnology offerings. Actually,100 may be a conservative estimate. The good\nthing for HR leaders about all this investment in AI is that more powerful\ntechnologies for things like information discovery, job opportunity to\ncandidate/employee matching and employee-sentiment analysis are all maturing,\ngetting more capable and being used by more companies in the \u201creal\u201d world.\nAlso, consultancy and analyst research is shining more light on the\ntechnologies, approaches and results being driven by the application of AI in\nthe workplace. Bottom line, in 2019 and beyond, AI tools are moving more\ntoward the mainstream of HR tech, and will increasingly be evaluated, deployed\nand measured like more traditional HR technologies have been\u2014with a focus on\nfit, capability and return on investment.\n\n**Employee Experience for the Win**\n\nIf there was one phrase heard more at HR Tech in 2019 than \u201cemployee\nexperience\u201d I can\u2019t think of it. Originally, it seemed like the \u201cexperience\u201d\nconversations were an offshoot of the decades-long discussion about employee\nengagement. \u201cExperience\u201d allows us to think more specifically about the\nindividual moments in an employee\u2019s relationship with work and the\norganization, and to develop processes and technologies that are meant to\nelevate these moments to make them easier, more valuable and designed with the\nemployee in mind. In HR tech, the influence of employee experience has\nmanifested in much more user-centric designs, cleaner and simpler interfaces,\nand technology much more focused on users, as opposed to back-office or IT\nadministrators. This is not just \u201chow it looks\u201d but much more about \u201chow it\nworks,\u201d or perhaps better said, \u201chow it helps me at work\u201d\u2014and that last\nviewpoint should be what HR leaders ask when evaluating all HR tech moving\nforward.\n\n**Don\u2019t Sleep on VR**\n\nThis last trend may be one that still feels a little under the radar for most\nHR leaders and organizations, but to me, 2019 was the year that virtual\nreality really began to mature and emerge as a viable technology for HR, and\nmost specifically, training and development professionals. One of the sessions\nat this year\u2019s HR Tech that I was most impressed by was a mega session on how\nmany leading employers (Walmart being the largest) are leveraging VR\ntechnology for employee training and development objectives. While VR, not\nunlike the famous experimental technology Google Glass, might never become a\nmainstream consumer technology, it seems very likely that the workplace\napplications are going to be increasingly significant. I think 2019 was the\nyear VR officially arrived in HR tech, and I am excited to see it develop even\nfurther in the coming years.\n\n**2020**\n\n**HR Technology for Me**\n\nAbove, I mentioned the familiar consumerization of HR tech, an extension of\nwhich, I think, is individual personalization of HR and workplace technology.\nMy favorite consumer comparison is the smartphone: Every new iPhone and the\nlike ships to consumers exactly the same\u2014loaded with the same software,\nlayout/interface and installed applications. Within mere minutes of being\nactivated, each of these millions of smartphones becomes unique\u2014as users add,\nmodify, adapt and configure their phones to support their own needs. And, by\nthe way, this unique user-defined configuration is not static\u2014it can and\nusually is updated almost constantly, as user needs change and different\nsupporting features become available. For 2020 and beyond, I expect to see\nthis individually oriented technology paradigm become more common in HR and\nworkplace technologies. HR-technology solutions will develop even more\nflexibility, adaptability and modularity (like your phone\u2019s app store) in\norder to give users almost unfettered ability to tailor their workplace\ntechnologies to their own preferences, giving them more control over their\ndata, their workflows and their experiences.\n\n**A Return to Wellbeing**\n\nEmployee wellbeing is not a new idea, but rather one that will see an\nincreased emphasis in 2020, and thus a corresponding uptick in HR-tech\ninvestments. We seem to be working more than ever, we are always tethered to\nwork via our smartphones and even the work/life balance people have kind of\nabandoned the idea that work and life can truly be separated\u2014advocating for a\nfuzzy concept of a work/life \u201cblend.\u201d Add to this the normal workplace\npressures of competitive global markets for most goods and services,\npersistent labor shortages in many industries and increases in the incidence\nof mental-health conditions in the population and, to me, this adds up to a\npotential crisis in many organizations. In 2020, I expect more HR leaders to\nlook again at wellbeing technologies to play a more significant role in their\norganizations and for the HR-tech companies that provide wellbeing solutions\nto innovate even more quickly to meet these challenges and opportunities.\n\n**HR Tech Everywhere**\n\nAnyone who has followed my writing, speaking or the _HR Happy Hour Show_ over\nthe last few years would not be surprised to hear how much I am enamored with\nmy Amazon Alexa device. When I am on the road, I find myself in hotel rooms\nasking Alexa for information, only then to remember Alexa is sitting on my\ncounter at home. And it stinks! I then have to find some other way to get the\ninformation that I expect is only a question away. Once Alexa is available,\nwith an incredibly simple user interface, life gets harder without it. That\nfrustration is why I think access to HR information, interaction and execution\nof transactions is going to become more widely available on smart technologies\nlike Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant. For years, most HR-tech experts have\nmade statements about how employees expect the ease of use and familiarity of\ntheir favorite consumer technologies be ported to their workplace\ntechnologies. I believe that statement is accurate, and the natural extension\nof is the voice interface used by Alexa and the like. We will see more HR tech\non these \u201ceverywhere\u201d interfaces in 2020; soon, asking Alexa for a shortlist\nof candidates for that important open role you are looking to fill will seem\njust as normal as asking her for the weather forecast.\n\nAs I mentioned at the top of this piece, 2019 was a great year for the HR\nTechnology Conference and the HR-technology market overall. There\u2019s probably\nnever been more interest, innovation, investment and importance placed on HR\ntech than at any time before. The market is growing and moving so fast it can\nbe hard, even for me, to see past the transactions, developments and\nannouncements to get a feel for the bigger picture and think about what really\nwill matter for HR and organizations. Of course, any \u201cpredictions\u201d articles or\n\u201ctrends\u201d pieces are only one person\u2019s view of things, so my best advice for HR\nleaders who need to make important technology decisions is to read as many of\nthese articles as possible and follow the great HR-tech coverage at _Human\nResource Executive_. Of course, make your plans to attend the HR Tech\nConference in 2020, where all of us can see whose predictions for the year\nwere closest to the bullseye. Here\u2019s to 2020 and another great year in HR\ntech!\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-what-trends-will-dominate-hr-tech-in-2020%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+trends+will+dominate+HR+tech+in+2020%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-what-trends-will-dominate-hr-tech-in-2020%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fsteve-\nboese-what-trends-will-dominate-hr-tech-in-2020%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

If so, then the creators of _Human Resource\nExecutive \u00ae_ and HR Technology Conference & Exposition\u00ae have a new conference\njust for you: Select HR Tech.\n\nThe conference, to be held June 9-11 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, was\nofficially announced Wednesday during the HR Technology Conference &\nExposition. \u201cThis is a natural progression of [HR Tech] because when people\nget back to their offices, it gets real,\" says [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com/?utm_source=hre_mag&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=shrtcontent)\nConference Chair Jeanne Achille, noting that \u201cimmersive is the key word\u201d for\nthe new conference.\n\n[**READ MORE: Follow along for full HR Tech Conference coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)\n\n\"Select HR Tech is really intended for those folks in the trenches who have\nownership of HR-tech projects in organizations and who are being measured by\ntheir ability to optimize the HR investment.\u201d\n\nBrian Sommer, CEO of TechVentive Inc., says that HR professionals are looking\nfor \"real value\" in HR tech products, but often get bogged down with too many\nproducts to consider. \u201cThe problem is when people come to [the HR Tech\nconference] \u2026 they go back to their office and talk to their peers, something\ngets lost in translation,\u201d says Sommer, who will be delivering the closing\nkeynote at Select HR Tech that will touch on those issues, how to solve them\nand more.\n\nAdditionally, according to Achille, the conference will give attendees the\nopportunity to:\n\n  * examine how to effectively use existing systems to their full potential;\n  * assess and determine what technology is best for their organization;\n  * take a personalized and forward-thinking, tactical approach to RFP, implementation and integration processes;\n  * and demonstrate the value of HR-technology investment to gain buy-in or continued support of stakeholders.\n\nThis \u201cintensely collaborative\u201d event offers facilitated practical\nconversations with peers about solutions to common pain points, Achille says,\nas well as in-depth master classes to determine which technology solutions are\nbest for your organization\u2019s current and anticipated future needs.\n\n[**SUBSCRIBE here to receive our daily\nemails.**](https://hrexecutive.com/home-page/subscribe/)\n\n\"The most important thing about any of these events is to make sure we deliver\ncontent that turns into community and knowledge that people actually take back\nand use immediately,\" says Jason Averbook, industry analyst and cofounder and\nCEO of Leapgen. \"A lot of this stuff isn\u2019t about buying new technology; a lot\nof it\u2019s about optimizing technology we have.\"\n\nAverbook will be delivering the opening keynote at Select HR Tech, which in\npart will touch on how HR professionals can think digitally about their\nsuccess.\n\nSelect HR Tech will feature small group discussions with industry analysts to\nlearn more about the industry, solutions and trends; collaborative networking\nto hear real-world lessons learned; and the opportunity to meet one on one\nwith solution providers to develop a tailored approach to addressing your\nunique challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at having a different conference experience than the HR Tech\nexperience,\u201d Achille says. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than HR Tech, but it\u2019s got a\ndifferent format, too.\u201d\n\nThe new conference\u2019s focus is on \u201cimmersive workshops\u201d and 90-minute master\nclasses taught by experts on such topics as building the business case for HR-\ntechnology projects and exploring the vendor landscape. The expo experience\nwill be similarly intimate and immersive, offering one-on-one meetings with\nvendors and an environment for deeper conversations.\n\n[**Watch our HR Tech videos 2019\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/videos/)\n\nAchille says attendees will learn the answer to questions like \u201cHow do you\noptimize an HR investment, [get that ROI](https://hrexecutive.com/measuring-\nthe-roi-of-tech/) and create the foundation for ongoing success?\u201d and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand that people will have the opportunity to\nsit across the table from peers from other companies to have networking\nconversations,\u201d she says, adding that, instead of standard, business-card-\nexchange networking, this will be \u201cthe kind of networking where you talk about\npain points and lessons learned that might be helpful to you.\u201d\n\nThat peer-to-peer knowledge exchange is really unique to the Select HR Tech\nmodel, she says, adding the conference will also feature \u201clots of exciting\ntechnologies and tutorials for attendees to [make decisions about what\ntech](https://hrexecutive.com/feeling-confused-about-the-hr-tech-marketplace/)\nwill serve as the underpinning for any HR-tech project.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of sitting and listening to an expert on a stage,\u201d Achille says,\n\u201cSelect HR Tech attendees will sit across the table from peers and industry\nexperts to do a deep dive into what makes HR tick and what will make them\nsuccessful.\u201d\n\nMichael J.

There is a significant trend\nof HR Technologies (HRTech) moving away from being just compliance-driven\nsystems to tools that provide actionable insights for better talent\nengagement.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR Tech News:** [ASU/GSV Education Summit Announces Andrew Temte as\nPanelist](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/learning-development/asugsv-\neducation-summit-announces-andrew-temte-as-panelist/)\n\nIt might be noted that Singapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in\nHRTech adoption, but the scenario seems to be fast changing. These HRTech\ntools are now helping enterprises hire, train, engage and retain employees\nbetter.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased Singapore HRTech Market Map (2019). The market map which is\ncomprehensive in terms of its coverage is a collaborative research product of\nAdrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and hrtech.sg, a Singapore-based boutique\nHRTech advisory and analyst firm.\n\nThe market map has categorized the service providers across seven major Talent\nsegments: Talent Acquisition (Employer Branding, Recruitment), Talent\nEngagement (Employer Onboarding, Performance Management), Talent Rewards\n(Compensation & Benefits), Talent Development (Training), Talent Analytics,\nTalent Operations (Automation & Shared Services), and finally, Human Resource\nManagement Systems (HRMS).\n\n\u201cThere are two key factors for the rapid growth of HRTech players servicing\nthe Singapore talent marketplace. Firstly, the productivity focus of the\nSingapore government is nudging enterprises to adopt digital HR systems faster\nand better. Second, enterprises are increasingly feeling the need to better\nengage with their employees, more specifically millennials, to recruit and\nretain them\u201d, says Adrian Tan.\n\n**HR Tech News** : [Bonusly](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/rewards-and-\nrecognition/bonusly-raises-15-million-seed-round/)[ Raises $1.5 Million Seed\nRound](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/rewards-and-recognition/bonusly-\nraises-15-million-seed-round/)\n\n\u201cThe really hot areas in HRTech seems to be Talent Acquisition and Talent\nEngagement, considering that over 50% of the players are present in this\nsegment. Enterprises are investing in new technologies that can automate the\nmundane and repeatable tasks and enable the HR teams to focus on higher order\nemployee engagement\u201d, adds Sriram Iyer, CEO, hrtech.sg\n\n![Singapore HR Tech Market Map](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-\nmarketplace%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=2019+Singapore+HR+Tech+Market+Map+Reveals+Over+160+Specialized+Service+Providers+Servicing+the+Singapore+Talent+Marketplace\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=2019+Singapore+HR+Tech+Market+Map+Reveals+Over+160+Specialized+Service+Providers+Servicing+the+Singapore+Talent+Marketplace&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-\nmarketplace%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-\nmarketplace%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-\nmarketplace%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=2019 Singapore HR Tech Market Map Reveals Over 160\nSpecialized Service Providers Servicing the Singapore Talent\nMarketplace&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-\nmarketplace%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

Influencers discuss how leaders can effectively navigate the\nchanging tides of technology.\n\nBy: [HRE and HR Tech Conference](https://hrexecutive.com/author/hre-and-hr-\ntech-conference/ \"Posts by HRE and HR Tech Conference\") | October 21, 2019 \u2022 5\nmin read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Top100HRTech-700x450-700x450.jpg)\n\nInfluence in HR technology comes from many places, takes many forms and\ncontinues to evolve over time. When the _HRE_ /[HR Tech\nConference](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/index) team met over to\nwork on this Influencers list **,** we knew it would be ![HR\ntech](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-100-HR-Tech-\nInfluencers-2019-106.jpg)important to consider all aspects of influence. Some\nhave more of a direct and immediate effect on products, while others have a\nmore subtle yet longer-term impact. It\u2019s safe to say all, however, are having\nan important and noticeable impact on where HR technology has been, where it\nis today and, perhaps most importantly, where it is heading. And that, above\nall else, informed the decision-making that went into compiling this list,\nwhich presents those being recognized in alphabetical order.\n\nClick here to see the full list of the [Top 100 HR Tech\nInfluencers](https://hrexecutive.com/top-100).\n\n**\u2014**\n\n**![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jason-\nLauritsen-150x150.jpg)Jason Lauritsen  \n****Keynote speaker, author and consultant  \n****--**\n\n\n\n## **  \nWhat area of the HR function will be most impacted by emerging technologies,\nand why?**\n\nI think recruiting and specifically interviewing/selection is likely to feel\nthe biggest effects in the long run. Our model of selection today is still\nlargely predicated on the human ability to evaluate other humans which we know\nfor certain is extraordinarily unreliable. As better science-based tools and\npractices emerge for evaluation and matching of human capabilities to job\nneeds, I expect a majority of traditional recruiting jobs to become obsolete\nand replaced by technology.\n\n## **In acquiring and implementing new technologies, what\u2019s the one or two\nmost common mistakes HR organizations make?**\n\nThe biggest mistake is treating technology as the solution rather than a tool.\nTools exist to facilitate processes, not the other way around. Too many\norganizations skip over the hard work of first defining the processes needed\nto solve their specific problems. This leads to falling in love with certain\nfeatures or functionality of technology that shows well in the sales phase but\nmay not actually solve a specific problem within their organization. It also\nleaves them trying to retro fit their processes to the technology, which is a\nrecipe for headaches and heart break.\n\n## **How is HR technology changing the way people work?**\n\nOn one hand, I'm hopeful that the latest evolution of HR tech tools is\nbuilding new positive habits around appreciation, seeking and using feedback,\nlearning on the fly, and finding greater agency in managing their own career\npaths. There are so many great tools out there. Which leads to the other hand,\nwhere I worry that all of these tools are actually creating more distractions\nand unintentionally making us both less productive and creative. Until the\nfunctionality we refer to today as \"HR Tech\" live and work within the tools we\nrely on to do our daily work, we've still got a lot of work left to do. A lot\nmore innovation is still needed.\n\n**\u2014**\n\n**![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jen-\nBenz-150x150.jpg)Jen Benz  \n****Senior Vice President, Communications Leader  \n****Segal Benz**\n\n\n\n## **  \nIn acquiring and implementing new technologies, what\u2019s the one or two most\ncommon mistakes HR organizations make?**\n\nA common mistake is to underestimate the promotion, behavior change and\nchange-management efforts needed to make the technology a success. Too many\norganizations consciously or unconsciously think \u201cif we build it, they will\ncome\u201d and don\u2019t plan for robust communication or the changes to workflow that\nare required. The result is a lot of great tools that go unused.\n\nAnother common mistake is focusing on the solution first instead of the\nbusiness need. There are so many incredible new providers that it is easy to\nsay \u201cI want that!\u201d before fully understanding the problem you\u2019re trying to\nsolve.\n\n## **Are there certain strategies that are more effective than others when it\ncomes to getting your workforce to use new HR technologies being put in\nplace?**\n\nThe best thing you can do is understand your workforce and then build\ntechnology to meet their needs. When you launch a new solution that solves a\nproblem and helps people be successful, they are going to want to use it.\nSecond, plan early so you have the resources to not just launch the new\ntechnology but drive ongoing adoption. A great way to drive adoption is to\ninclude high-value content that people want or need (like your employee\ndiscount, time card or scheduling). Finally, build in ways to gather user\nfeedback so you can continuously improve the tools.\n\n## **How is HR technology changing the way people work?**\n\nNew technology is changing so much of our work and personal lives. HR\ntechnology is certainly impacting work in many of the same ways that consumer\ntechnology impacts our personal lives\u2014making information more accessible,\ngiving us smarter ways to accomplish things and connecting us with others\n24/7.\n\nIt is important to remember that employees\u2019 expectations are changing\ndramatically, and people have less patience for things that don\u2019t work. New\nentrants to the workforce expect to have the same seamless experience at work\nas in the rest of their lives.\n\n**\u2014**\n\n**![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Andy-\nSpence-150x150.jpg)Andy Spence  \n****HR Transformation Director  \n****Glass Bead Consulting**\n\n\n\n## **  \nWhat area of the HR function will be most impacted by emerging technologies,\nand why?**\n\nThe way we match work with workers, including traditional hiring is the area\nof the HR function that will be impacted most by the use of AI and blockchain\ntechnologies. As HR responds to the digital age, we will replace the tired\nresume/CV with digital career profiles. New technology will enable\nverification of identity and work credentials to quicker and more transparent\npayment mechanisms. This will enable more efficient peer-to-peer work matching\nplatforms which will help the job market for certain categories of workers.\n\n## **What\u2019s the single most dramatic shift you see happening in the HR tech\nspace today?**\n\nThe most dramatic shift to HR technology is how we manage our career data.\nCurrently we freely give our career data to help us find work, and this data\nis then sold to recruiters. This has created an inefficient market with high\ncosts for employees or employers. A new infrastructure for work is being built\nwhere individuals own and control their verified career credentials. This will\nchange how we find workers, suitable work, manage our careers and our\norganisations\u2014and of course changes most of our current HR Tech\ninfrastructure.\n\n## **In acquiring and implementing new technologies, what\u2019s the one or two\nmost common mistakes HR organizations make?**\n\nBuying new technology has become so much easier with cloud-based technology,\nthis has given us many opportunities including greater agility and lower risk.\nHowever, we have lost some old school rigour along the way. Any new\ntechnology, or indeed organizational change, needs to start with the right\nquestions. Rather than \u2018How do we implement AI/blockchain in our\norganisation?\u2019 we need to ask \u2018How can we make our business better and what\ntools will we need?\u2019 and \u2018What is the evidence that this change will achieve\nour goals?\u2019\n\n**\u2014**\n\n**![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Derek-Belch--\n150x150.jpg)Derek Belch  \n****Founder and CEO  \n****STRIVR**\n\n\n\n## **  \nWhat area of the HR function will be most impacted by emerging technologies,\nand why?**\n\nWe\u2019ll see the most dramatic technology shift in learning and development.\nRecent technological breakthroughs and demographic shifts mean roles are\nchanging. Established career paths are at risk of being eliminated due to\nautomation, while many workers are in need of much more advanced technical\nknowledge than the prior generation. Onboarding times are also being\ncompressed, with more to learn in a shorter time. As a result, maintaining a\nwell-trained, highly engaged workforce is more and more challenging against a\nbackdrop of business leaders looking to improve performance, reduce safety\nincidents, enhance productivity, and reduce turnover. The opportunity to\nreinvent performance is here, and transforming employee learning will be the\nkey to unlocking it.\n\n## **What\u2019s the single most dramatic shift you see happening in the HR tech\nspace today?**\n\nJobs are changing rapidly, yet the way many organizations train employees\nhasn\u2019t. Traditional training is inefficient, costly and time-consuming. At the\nsame time, measuring employee performance has been challenging and bias-\nridden.\n\nImmersive learning in virtual reality offers employers a revolutionary way of\nassessing, training and managing people. It simulates real-world scenarios in\na safe, controlled and engaging environment. Immersive learning combines\ncutting-edge VR with advanced learning theory, data science and spatial design\nto enable employees to experience real-world situations before they ever step\nfoot on the job. And it also offers unique engagement and attention data,\nenabling a true account of performance.\n\n## **How is HR technology changing the way people work?**\n\nImmersive technologies are at the forefront of a transformative workplace\nrevolution. They are fundamentally changing the way people learn, providing\non-demand, real-world simulations that lead to real-world behavioral change.\nWith immersive learning, people can now learn in the flow of work, so there is\nminimal disruption to the business and maximum impact on performance.\nImmersive technologies boost engagement, confidence and morale. Unique\nperformance insights also allow learners to self-identify areas of strength or\nareas that need improvement.\n\nIt\u2019s a transformative technological revolution in the HR space, and one that\u2019s\ngoing to become commonplace in the years to come.\n\n**\u2014**\n\n**![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Boris-\nGroysberg-150x150.jpg)Boris Groysberg  \n****Professor of Business Administration  \n****Harvard Business School**\n\n\n\n## **  \nWhat area of the HR function will be most impacted by emerging technologies,\nand why?**\n\nThanks to emerging technologies, training opportunities will soon be available\nanytime and people will not have to wait months for the next training session.\nFurthermore, training opportunities will be highly customizable, allowing\nfirms to align them closely with their strategies. They will also be more\ninteractive, which should increase their effectiveness. In our HBS background\nnote \u201cDeveloping Leaders\u201d, my colleagues and I write, \u201cLectures can be used to\nfamiliarize participants with conceptual ideas and material, but interactive\ntechniques must be employed if the abstract knowledge is to translate into new\nskills.\u201d Emerging technologies will play a pivotal role in increasing access\nto these kids on interactive opportunities.\n\n## **What\u2019s the single most dramatic shift you see happening in the HR tech\nspace today?**\n\nThere is a shift happening in technology today with the illumination of the\npervasive gender gap in the field, thanks in part to the #metoo movement of\nrecent years and some high-profile lawsuits against tech companies claiming\ndiscriminatory practices based on gender. Some tech firms still have biases in\ntheir hiring practices, pass over deserving women for promotions, compensate\nwomen less than their male counterparts, or foster a culture that looks the\nother way in cases of sexism of sexual harassment. As a result, firms today\nare expected to do more to attract and retain female talent. Data science and\nAI will provide some useful tools to help companies build more diverse and\ninclusive cultures.\n\n## **In acquiring and implementing new technologies, what\u2019s the one or two\nmost common mistakes HR organizations make?**\n\nThe first mistake is not considering how technology fits with the business\nstrategy of the firm, instead investing in \u201cthe flavor of the month\u201d. The\nsecond mistake is not generating buy-in nor effectively managing\nimplementation. Firms do not manage the implementation of new technology as a\nreal change management project and underestimate the time required to do it.\nNext, firms roll out a new technology in its entirety, instead of in small\npieces, which would allow them to pivot as new information or data arrives.\nLastly, firms neglect to train non-HR professionals on how to use and leverage\nthe technology. Unfortunately, most firms struggle with implementing new\ntechnologies with only a small percentage realizing significant positive ROI.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fheres-\nhow-to-make-sense-of-the-dramatic-shifts-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Here%27s+how+to+make+sense+of+the+dramatic+shifts+in+HR+tech&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fheres-\nhow-to-make-sense-of-the-dramatic-shifts-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fheres-\nhow-to-make-sense-of-the-dramatic-shifts-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

The\ntechnology in this space continues to evolve, so much so, that employers today\nare looking for better technological solutions that will address every need of\nthe employees.\n\n  \n\nAlmost every company has an appraisal cycle or salary increment. However, the\nprocess is tiresome. For an employee, a performance cycle begins with setting\ntheir goals for the year, updating the managers on their achievements and\nfinally closing with an annual appraisal.\n\n  \n\n![Dockabl\nfounders](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/70651a302d6d11e9aa979329348d4c3e/Imagedtqy1570169661708jpg?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\n(L to R) Sanjeev and Samarth Co-founders , Dockabl\n\nTo make the process more user-friendly, two human resources management\nprofessionals, **Samarth Masson (36), and Sanjeev Grover (37)** , started a\nSaaS-based HR tech startup, Dockabl.\n\n  \n\nStarted in 2017, Dockabl is an employee experience platform that enables\norganisations to do continuous performance management with tech-based tools\nlike structured goals, tracking progress, real-time feedback and peer\nrecognition. The app is built for the benefit of employees, managers, HRs and\nleaders equally.\n\n##  **Casual chat turning into business idea**\n\nA casual conversation about the HR industry between the duo led to the idea of\nlaunching Dockabl. Having worked as HR consultants for years, Samarth and\nSanjeev agreed that there is one problem they must go after.\n\n  \n\n\"We realised that there is no interconnected system for people to manage their\nwork, performance, reputation, and development in an organisation,\" Samarth\nsays.\n\n  \n\nA serial entrepreneur and the Founder of Cogitohub, , Samarth exited it in\nearly 2017, to start Dockabl. Prior to this, he worked with consulting firms\nthat included Right Management, PwC and Aon Hewitt.\n\n  \n\nSimilarly, Sanjeev worked as a Director at Deloitte and managed business\ndevelopment and client delivery for Human Capital Consulting Practice, where\nhe focused on organisation design and effectiveness, performance management,\nleadership development, change and  transformation, etc.\n\n  \n\n\"We realised that most organisations have their processes either broken or\nextremely siloed, which means there are different sets of people looking at\nyour performance, engagements, development, rewards, compensation, and\nrecognition, etc. These silos do not have a good interrelation and employees\nsometimes get destroyed by this experience,\" he adds.\n\n  \n\nA report published by People Matters TechHR said that, while adoption of\ntechnology in HR is increasing among the Indian companies, levels of\nautomation in crucial HR functions like identifying high potential\nindividuals, succession planning and strategic workforce management, remains\nconsiderably low.\n\n  \n\nThe study also found that, while tech adoption is prevalent and, on the rise,\nwith 70 percent companies having some level of automation in the HR processes,\nit remained low in critical areas like identifying and incentivising High\nPotential Employees (HiPos). In HiPo management, only 23 percent of Indian\ncompanies have automated more than half the HR functions.\n\n  \n\nWhile digging up the market, the duo realised that there is no tech-based\nmarket solution or enterprise resource planning (ERPs), that can solve the\nissue.\n\n  \n\n> \"There were mostly glorified workflows, none catering to overall employee\n> experience. Managing performances, recognition and career progression is the\n> role of team leaders and managers. This must be done in the flow of work.\n> It's currently done ceremonially by HR,\" he adds.\n\n  \n\n\"Organisations today are seeking a point solution which can deliver continuous\nperformance management, on-going feedback and recognition for the employees.\nThey are desperately wanting to move away from legacy tools that bog them\ndown. These end-to-end tools suffer from complex and  inflexible processes,\nwhich often fail to translate the actual processes that are defined by the\norganisational modus operandi and  culture,\" Samarth continues.\n\n  \n\nThe duo raised a seed capital of $160k from friends and family, established\nthe product roadmap, created tech architecture and coded the first modules, to\nstart Dockabl.\n\n## **App for all**\n\nSpeaking about the offering, Samarth says, . \"For the employees, we are an\neasy-to-use platform that manages the daily work, development plans and\nconversations around performance. For managers, we are a handy app that\nmanages team productivity and  motivation. And, for HR and leadership, we\nprovide a digital interface to the key people practices, which not only helps\ndeliver but, also gives back insights on the process and  people.\"\n\n  \n\n\"Dockabl enables users to track their progress on a real time basis. It also\nenables peers to recognise each other for the good work done. Dockabl also\nensures that all reviews, ranging from quick pulse surveys to monthly catch-\nups and even annual appraisals, can be done with ease,\" he adds.\n\n## **Growth story**\n\nInitially in 2016, the Delhi-based startup took time to get its product fit\nfor the market. Once they got it correct, in 2017, the founders never looked\nback.\n\n  \n\nThe startup runs on a subscription-based business model with a per user per\nmonth fee structure. \"It ensures repeat revenue year-on-year,\" Samarth says.\n\n  \n\nFrom one client in March 2018 to currently serving 25 clients, that includes\nFlipkart, Becton Dickinson, Tata Realty, Clix Capital among others, the\ncompany's monthly run-rate is at $14.4K.\n\n  \n\n\"We have a projected ARR of $0.5 million for FY20,\" Samarth says.  Dockabl,\nwhich is yet to turn profitable, is expecting to close revenue of $9.41\nmillion for FY21.\n\n##  **Future Plans**\n\nCurrently, Dockabl is working to enhance its platform for a global market. It\nis planning to launch Dockabl 2.0 early next year, for India and the US\nmarkets.\n\n  \n\n> \"We will also be enhancing the platform by including machine learning and AI\n> capabilities. In the latter half of 2020, we will be building a data\n> analytics engine and enter the south-east Asia and Middle-East markets,\"\n> Samarth says.\n\nThe startup is also developing a plug & play version of Dockabl, which will be\navailable off-the shelf for employees and managers, to indulge in and enhance\ntheir productivity.\n\n  \n\nThe company has raised a total of $1.26 million in funding till date from\nvarious sources. It is now exploring Series-A funding round in the next six\nmonths to build Dockabl 2.0 and Dockabl Plug & Play.\n\n  \n\n ** _(Edited by Suman Singh)_**\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/dc9aa130-2d6c-11e9-aa97-9329348d4c3e/startupbharat_\\(3\\)1556892017303.png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)\nAlso Read\n\n### [Startup Bharat] This Jaipur-based HR tech startup has built an Ola-like\naggregator platform fo...\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2019/05/startup-bharat-hyrefox-aggregator-platform-\nola)\n\n  \n\n __\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n**How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

Unhappy with what he was\ndoing, the **IIT-Guwahati alumnus** started applying for other jobs, but that\ndidn't work out so well.\n\n  \n\nThe worst part was not rejection, but the fact that **he would never get a\nresponse from recruiters**.\n\n  \n\nThis frustrating experience led him to think about the **lack of\ntransparency** **in the recruitment process**. He realised that **large\ncorporations didn 't have the time and bandwidth to respond to every\ncandidate**.\n\n  \n\n>  **He tells _YourStory_ , \"I had no clarity on what stage applications were\n> getting rejected, or if they were noticed at all. With corporations\n> receiving millions of applications every year, the unstructured hiring\n> process not only keeps candidates in the dark, but also deprives\n> organisations of the best talent.\"**\n\n  \n\n![Skillate](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/730b50702d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/Skillate-1582267767296.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nThe Skillate team is working to make the recruitment process easy and\ntransparent.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/730b5070-2d6c-11e9-aa97-9329348d4c3e/Keith_Bergelt_OIN-21560942633837.png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### [The Turning Point] What drove these entrepreneurs to build an API\ndevelopment platform now used by 9M developers\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/01/turning-point-postman-api-developers)\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nBipul soon partnered with **Kumar Sambhav** and **Anand Kumar** to launch\n**Skillate** , which uses cutting-edge technology to make recruitment easy,\nfast, and transparent.\n\n  \n\nThe **AI-enabled** recruitment platform helps companies to **optimise\nrecruitment operations**. The enterprise hiring process in India is still\nmanual, tedious, and complicated, and Skillate uses natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to understand job requirements and ranks candidates against\njob posts.\n\n  \n\nBipul says this methodology **saves a lot of time while shortlisting\ncandidates.**\n\n  \n\n> \"Using **data science and predictive analytics** , we help our customers\n> engage with the right candidates, at the right time.

Most of them liked the product\nofferings, but the startup did not find an appropriate fit because of **budget\nconstraints and low hiring volumes**.\n\n  \n\nThings changed when Skillate featured on the front page of a leading\nnewspaper. In the week that followed, Skillate, which was a four-member team\nthen, made **156 connections with enterprises,** which Bipul says was \"the\nbiggest turning point\".\n\n  \n\n> \"For the first time, we had to prioritise meetings with prospective clients.\n> **Skillate got its first enterprise client** , and there was no looking\n> back. Working with enterprises, we not only got to know a lot about the\n> recruitment industry, but also **realised that we were a perfect fit for\n> enterprise clients** ,\" Bipul says.\n\n  \n\nToday, Skillate has **a team of more than 30 people** and is working with\n**over 15 enterprise clients**. The Skillate platform **helps enterprises in\nAI-powered job posting, candidate matching, screening conversations** with the\nhelp of a chat bot, interview scheduling, and onboarding.\n\n  \n\nIt claims to **reduce screening time by 95 percent** , increase overall\ncandidate conversion efficiency by 2x, and **reduce hiring costs by 30\npercent**. Their proprietary algorithms are tested on **over 20 million\nresumes** , and the platform can **screen up to five lakh resumes in four\nseconds** , the CEO says.\n\n  \n\nIn October 2019, Skillate raised **$1 million in pre-Series A funding** from\n**Mynavi Corporation** , the Founders of Whatfix and Incubate Fund.\n\n  \n\n ** _(Edited by Teja Lele Desai)_**\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

This\nwill involve launching new products for the benefit of both companies and\ncandidates.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce this investment, which will allow us to keep\ntripling in size every year and to launch exciting new products for companies\nand candidates,\u201d [said](https://techstartups.com/2019/09/18/brazilian-\nrecruiting-startup-revelo-raises-15m-series-b-help-companies-source-screen-\nknowledge-workers-latin-america/) co-founder Lachlan de Crespigny.\n\nLed by the IFC, this is reportedly the most valuable round that a Latin\nAmerican HRtech startup has ever raised, according to\n[Techstartups](https://techstartups.com/2019/09/18/brazilian-recruiting-\nstartup-revelo-raises-15m-series-b-help-companies-source-screen-knowledge-\nworkers-latin-america/).\n\nConsidering that fellow Brazilian HRtech startup\n[Xerpa](https://www.contxto.com/en/brazil/xerpa-lands-us12-9-million-to-\nexpand-hr-technology-explore-fintech/) essentially claimed the same\naccomplishment with its US$12.9 million Series B, it's clear that the numbers\njust keep on growing, notably in Brazil.\n\nPreviously, the IFC has invested in Loggi, Creditas, GuiaBolso, among other\ncompanies. Co-investors included FJLabs, Dalus Capital, in addition to early-\nstage supporters such as Valor Capital and Seek.\n\n### HRtech\n\nBased in S\u00e3o Paulo, [Revelo](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo)\nspecializes in HR recruitment, dedicated to aiding the unemployed find\npromising new careers. Lachlan de Crespigny and Lucas Mendes founded the\ncompany in 2015 that uses a machine learning-based platform to match qualified\ncandidates with the most relevant employment opportunities.\n\nPart of [Revelo\u2019s](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo) business\nentails \u201ccurating\u201d candidates based on their skills as well as knowledge. With\nin-depth applicant profiles, the platform essentially plays matchmaker,\nconnecting the most qualified professionals with appropriate gigs.\n\nUnlike other companies, this one caters to \u201cknowledge\u201d workers making mid to\nhigh incomes, particularly those in finance, management, technology and\nmarketing.\n\nAt least in Latin America, many experts still resort to old-school means to\nland jobs. That's to say, a lot of paper trails, not to mention excruciatingly\nslow processing times.  \n\n\u201cMost knowledge workers in Latin America still find their jobs offline,\u201d\n[said](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/revelo-raises-15m-series-b-to-\nhelp-companies-source-and-screen-knowledge-workers-in-latam-300921014.html)\nMendes. \u201cOur goal is to become a go-to online platform to help them navigate\ntheir careers.\u201d\n\n### Unemployment in Brazil\n\nOne of the most prominent issues that\n[Revelo](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo) is tackling is Brazil\u2019s\nhigh unemployment rate. While the number of jobless citizens staggers around\n13 million, [Revelo](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo) has been\nsteadily tripling its size.\n\n\u201cThis happens because our focus is on knowledge workers,\u201d\n[said](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/revelo-raises-15m-series-b-to-\nhelp-companies-source-and-screen-knowledge-workers-in-latam-300921014.html)\nMendes. \u201cIn areas of high-demand, such as financial markets and technology,\nthe demand for talent keeps growing.\u201d\n\nWhether working as a Data Engineer or Growth Hacker, many professionals come\nout very satisfied based on their interaction with\n[Revelo](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo).\n\n\u201cMy experience was amazing,\u201d [said](https://www.revelo.com.br/para-empresas)\nAndr\u00e9 Santos, a UX Designer. \u201cFrom the moment I joined the platform and\nreceived the proposal to the feedback I got after I was hired.\"\n\n### Benefits\n\nWhile employees benefit from job placement assistance, perks also exist for\nBrazilian companies partnering with\n[Revelo](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo). Equipped with its\ntechnology, not only do partners rapidly source and screen talent but also\nfill job vacancies.\n\nFor roles that require specialized knowledge, businesses can find, interview,\nnot to mention hire candidates in an average of 14 days. That\u2019s 5 times\nquicker than offline recruiters at 20 percent of the cost.\n\nFamous companies using [Revelo\u2019s](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo)\nsolution include QuintoAndar, Gympass, Ita\u00fa, 99 Taxis, as well as many others.\nDepending on the industry, common job placements include roles in the finance,\nmarketing, data, design, business administration and engineering departments.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://i1.wp.com/www.contxto.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/image-2.png?fit=696%2C336&ssl=1)Source: Revelo's\n[website](https://www.revelo.com.br/).\n\nAs of today, [Revelo's](https://database.contxto.com/company/revelo) network\nincorporates over 3,000 companies, in addition to approximately 1 million\ncandidates.

Conference and Exposition ended\nFriday, the lessons learned and the connections made will continue all year.\nAnd so will coverage of related topics and trends from the _Human Resource\nExecutive_

topics you'd like us to delve\ninto more deeply for you throughout the upcoming year.

Rely on what you see\nin the real world, advised Marcus Buckingham, and use only good data to build\nyour tools.\n\n\n\n## [The comprehensive power of data](https://hrexecutive.com/how-workday-\nharnessed-the-power-of-data/)\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HR-\nTechnology-0322-Carin-Taylor-700x425.jpg)](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-\ntech-2019-how-agile-innovated-walmarts-hiring/)\n\nCarin Taylor, chief diversity officer for Workday, speaks during Workday's\nopening session of the Women in HR Technology Summit at the Venetian on Oct.\n1, 2019, in Las Vegas. (Photo by Isaac Brekken for Human Resource Executive)\n\nMore and more companies are realizing the potential that workforce data can\nhave to not only personalize the employee experience but to make deep inroads\nin areas like diversity and belonging. These efforts are poised to have\nlasting effects on both retainment and recruitment.\n\n\n\n## [A disconnect between HR, workers on the \u2018employee\nexperience\u2019](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-video-question-of-the-day/)\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Q-of-the-day-\nscreenshot-700x397.jpg)](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-5-hr-lessons-\nfrom-barbara-corcoran/)\n\nHR Tech Top 100 Influencer Mervyn Dinnen notes that workers often don\u2019t see\neach work experience as a separate event.\n\nWhile HR leaders tend to think of each piece of an employee\u2019s job experience\nas its own separate event (onboarding/annual review/etc.), it\u2019s important to\nremember that, as HR Tech Top Influencer Mervyn Dinnen noted, workers often\ndon\u2019t see it that way. \u201cFor the employee, it\u2019s one seamless journey for them\nand, unfortunately, we\u2019ve been sectionalizing it.\u201d\n\n\n\n## [**Employers need to evolve their HR tech\nstrategy**](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-averbook-it-doesnt-own-\ndigital-strategy-hr-does/)\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Averbook-HR-\nTech-2019-700x467.jpg)](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-pilot-wins-\npitchfest/)\n\nAnalyst Jason Averbook, CEO and cofounder of Leapgen, speaks about the\ndifference between digital and technological transformations.\n\nMost employers have already bought into the value of HR technology. The next\ntransformation is ensuring that employers are continually evaluating and\nchanging their technology to get the most out of it. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do inside\nyour company that matters, not the technology,\u201d said Stacey Harris, vice\npresident of research and analytics at [Sierra-\nCedar](https://hrexecutive.com/new-sierra-cedar-report-what-should-happen-\nafter-the-hr-tech-buy-in/). That sentiment was shared by [Jason\nAverbook](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-averbook-it-doesnt-own-digital-\nstrategy-hr-does/), industry analyst and CEO and cofounder of LeapGen, who\nsaid HR professionals need to nurture their technologies to create a true\ndigital strategy. \u201cA lot of us are used to putting in pieces of technology and\nletting them sit,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cYou have to treat investments in tech more\nlike a pet than a rock. You need to look at it every day and measure its\nsuccess.\u201d\n\n**[SUBSCRIBE here to receive our daily emails.](https://hrexecutive.com/home-\npage/subscribe/)**\n\nElizabeth Clarke is executive editor of _Human Resource Executive_.

She has worked in all the integral constituents\nof HR & Organizational capability development specializing as an HR Centre of\nExcellence professional. As a human resource leader, she has successfully\nbuilt leadership effectiveness, strategic HR transformation, resource\nengagement, talent and learning capabilities in multinational organizations\nthat helped achieve business objectives and deliver premier performance.\n\nIn addition, she is also an angel investor in Bobble. In an exclusive\ninteraction with People Matters, she throws light on how 2019 was as a year\nfor HR Tech and how 2020 see more movement towards corporate learning &\ndevelopment, HR analytics, and performance management & collaborative team-\nbased technology solutions.\n\n### How was 2019 as a year for HR Tech startups?\n\nThe number of new HR Tech companies are growing at a very fast pace and newer\ntechnology in various aspects of the HR function is proof that HR tech is here\nto stay and is transforming HR function faster than what was expected. Most of\nthe activity has been around recruitment technology and this space is\nundergoing some major transformations.\n\n> Large companies are now slowly moving away from the years of legacy HRM\n> solutions towards new tech solutions along with a new focus on collaborative\n> platforms and rich social experience for the employees with tools such as\n> Yammer, Teams etc.\n\n### What as per you were the general trends in adoption, hiring talent in\nstartups?\n\nThe general trends in hiring talent are focused on\n\n\u2022 **Optimizing the Hiring funnel** with intelligent recruitment automation to\nfunnel the right talent for the job which includes looking at in-house talent\nthat might fit the job but has not applied for it. This would result in a\nsignificant drop in cost for acquiring talent and also help retain and enable\nthe growth of talent at a faster pace within the organization.\n\n\u2022 **Tackling challenges resulting from recruitment bias** using new tech\nscreening tools ensuring candidates are assessed solely on merit driving\ndiversity and inclusion as key the philosophy.\n\n\u2022 **Assessments & Screening of candidates-** this is a very big advantage for\nearly adopters of the technology who recruit large numbers of fresh graduates\nfrom colleges. It will help not only get the right talent but also the right\ncultural fit for the organization.\n\n### What do you think were major challenges faced by HR tech startups?\n\nWhile much of the effort has been focused on talent acquisition, collaboration\nand analytics, the new tech also opens up many new vistas of employee\nwellbeing, development, and performance management & employee engagement.\nTechnology is here the biggest challenge for tech startups and also resistance\nto change & adopting the new technology.\n\nWhile there is a general fear that technology is going replace people from\ntheir current jobs, there is also this vulnerable feeling about the vast data\nthat is being collected by HR tech and issues around values & ethics around\nthe use of this individual\u2019s personal/professional data. With the lack of\nregulations & governance around fast-paced technological advances, the fear is\nnot unfounded but that also puts the brakes on the HR tech startups that make\na good business case but are held back fearing a pushback from traditional HR\norganizations.\n\n### How do you predict is 2020 going to be for HR Tech-what major trends you\nsee in the future?\n\nI think 2020 is going to see the continued growth of HR Tech, with larger\norganizations embracing the change heralded by HR Tech. Data protection and\nimpact assessment of the large data collected will lead to new leadership\nroles like Data Protection officers and Governments will become more\nstructured in forming regulation bodies around data. One of the big changes in\nthe near future would be around performance management processes.\n\nWe at Bobble are already working on changes to this process moving away from\nthe usual quarterly, half-yearly and annual performance reviews which is seen\nas a slow & non-progressive process towards a more dynamic, real-time data-\ndriven process. We aim to do this by providing a dashboard of parameters that\ncan quantify performance, quality of deliverables, individual\u2019s contribution\nas a team player, engagement, cultural behaviours & organizational priorities.\nThe goal of this dashboard is to help drive Self-Management practice across\nthe organization.\n\nAlso, moving on from the days of annual reviews, the goal is to identify the\nissues as they arise. As an HR leader, I think this is wonderful for HR as it\nnot only makes performance management more dynamic, self-managed and growth\ndriven but it also helps identify & bring to surface systemic problems across\nthe organization, by using data analytics.\n\n### How do you think will be the year for HR and HR Tech investment-wise?\n\n> Investment in HR tech is riding the high wave and will continue the next\n> year too.\n\nI personally think this is a very good time to invest in HR tech. The\nfollowing stats give an idea of how 2019 was-\n\n\u2022 Recruitment technology for targeting high-quality candidates (72%)\n\n\u2022 Team collaboration platforms such as Slack, Chatter and Jive (69%)\n\n\u2022 Voice recognition software (58%)\n\n\u2022 Virtual reality interfaces (57%)\n\n\u2022 Chatbots (54%)\n\nWhile the above will continue to remain the main attraction for HR tech\ninvestors I think there will be more movement towards corporate learning &\ndevelopment, HR analytics, and performance management & collaborative team-\nbased technology solutions. With the role of HR Business Partners shrinking\nslowly and most of the administrative tasks such as compliance etc. being\noutsourced to specialists, I think the industry is poised to embrace\ninnovative HR tech solutions. There will definitely be resistance in the path;\nit will be the HR Business Partner who is bogged down in the daily operations\nand will play a very key role in enabling successful rollout and acceptance of\nthe new HR technology in his/her respective companies.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"),\n[#Rewind2019](/tag/rewind2019?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=rewind2019\n\"Browse more in: Rewind2019\"),\n[#HRTech](/tag/hrtech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hrtech \"Browse more\nin: HRTech\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

However, as we continue to see the exponential\ngrowth and dominance of technologies including HR Tech, MarTech and FinTech,\nwhy are operations teams the poor technology relation? Most importantly, what\nis the business impact?\n\nDespite it being key to a happier and more productive workforce, operations\ntechnology (OpsTech) has had a fraction of the $400 million HR Tech market -\nOpsTech being valued at USD 27.20 Billion in 2016 (and expected to grow at a\nCAGR of 6.7 per cent between 2017 and 2022). Yet OpsTech has the potential to\ndirectly help organisations to refine business growth strategies, resolve\nskills shortages and enable retention. Equally, it has the ability to support\nfinancial leaders in setting and delivering business growth targets, its\nvisibility and analytics unlocking the untapped areas of potential across the\nworkforce.\n\nFurthermore, the 100bn MarTech industry and is set to grow by 27 per cent over\nthe next four years, but OpsTech has the potential to open up new areas for\nrevenue opportunities by unlocking the data behind business development,\nprofitable business and areas for growth.\n\nSo, as the underlying science behind so many of a company's best kept secrets,\nhow exactly can OpsTech revolutionise the modern business?\n\n## Bandwidth blind spots\n\n  * [Battle for bandwidth: The hidden truth](https://www.itproportal.com/features/battle-for-bandwidth-the-hidden-truth/)\n\nOperations leaders and project team heads still tend to live in silos, working\nwith timesheets and struggling to maintain a real-time view of the skills and\nbandwidth they have in the business. What this leads to is a function that\ncannot effectively contribute to the bottom line nor strategy of the business,\nwhich would ultimately drive growth and productivity.\n\nWhilst many teams are bogged down accounting for their resources or hiring\nanew, many are not deploying the best of their skillsets. A lack of real-time,\ndata-driven technology means that many organisations are, quite simply, taking\nan inefficient stab in the dark with their resources. This means they are\nblind to the additional bandwidth that may be present within their existing\nteam and operational set up. OpsTech can, however, provide the antidote to\nthese 'bandwidth blind spots', using data-led planning to automatically\nhighlight pockets of potential for growth, better service, and happier teams -\nall with real-time accuracy.\n\nOpsTech can be considered a vital back-office resource for businesses,\nenabling internal skills discovery in a time of industry skills shortages.\nWhereas businesses may have previously recruited on a 'knee-jerk basis' -\nusing gut-feeling to assess when to hire - they can now make accurate, data-\ninformed decisions that put an end to blind staffing processes.\n\nSimilarly, when a client throws a curveball in the form of additional work or\nshort deadlines, businesses can assess their current workforce for the certain\nskills they now require and use real-time insights to assess whether\nadditional staff recruitment is necessary in order to plug the gap. OpsTech\nprovides the real answer to 'busy or billable?', which is the killer question\nin so many project-based work environments.\n\n## Capacity vs. the people\n\n  * [All-aboard: putting employees at the heart of the digital transformation journey](https://www.itproportal.com/features/all-aboard-putting-employees-at-the-heart-of-the-digital-transformation-journey/)\n\nIn short - they can't, at least not effectively.\n\nFurthermore, poor capacity planning and resource management due to a lack of\nOpsTech affects more than just a business's efficiency and its potential\nrevenues. In fact, when it comes to resource planning, many decision makers\nmake the mistake of viewing their company growth potential and its people as\nseparate entities, leading to one being sacrificed in favour of the other -\nwith detrimental effects to the workforce.\n\nWithout the assistance of OpsTech, gut-instinct decisions can lead to poor\ncapacity planning and an over-stretched workforce, which in turn, leads to a\nlack of downtime for employees. As client needs trump personal growth\nopportunities, this combined with poor planning eventually leads to the\nstalled development of a team. In fact, timesheets and standard 'revenue per\nhead' metrics often don't factor in a time allowance for training either. It\nwon't be long before the workforce notices, either - likely leading to a high\nrate of staff turnover.\n\nMore than ever, the wellbeing of employees demonstrates that there is a need\nfor 'workforce science', which is currently underserved in the operations\ndepartment. According to research from Precursive, only 15 per cent of C-level\nexecutives feel that they manage capacity well, with 100 per cent recognising\nthat company and personal objectives are impacted by capacity. Without real\ntime and accurate capacity visibility, executives will struggle to factor in\nthe mindset and requirements of the new millennial workforce as an additional\nbusiness priority.\n\nThe ongoing four-day week debate, for example, is just one representative of\nthis need to evolve the operational management of a business to reflect new\ngenerational demands. Without real-time, data-led capacity and skills\nevaluation, how can businesses accurately balance their own operational and\norganisational needs with the expectations of the millennial workforce?\n\n## Creating more successful companies\n\nWith OpsTech, business and project teams can focus on the meaningful over the\nmundane, completing valuable business work rather than unnecessary admin, such\nas timesheets. By reducing stress to create happier workplaces, but growing\ncapacity to service customers, the case for OpsTech has never been stronger.\nParticularly in uncertain times, the pressure on operations teams to do more\nwith less whilst staff are demanding more than ever from the from the working\nenvironment - the need for OpsTech will be paramount.\n\nOpsTech can enable companies working in team environments, regardless of their\nsector, to discover that they do in fact have capacity for more business, and\ndo have the skills ready to be utilised within their existing workforce. Add\nto this happier staff and more efficient business processes, ultimately,\nyou're talking about OpsTech bringing about increased success and better\nperformance from existing infrastructures and resources - the fundamentals of\na company.\n\nDon't let your operations teams sit out in the cold - incorporate OpsTech to\nbring them the tech-led benefits of every other business department.\n\n  * [Scaling up technology could be the key to business success](https://www.itproportal.com/news/scaling-up-technology-could-be-the-key-to-business-success/)\n\n _Jonathan Corrie, CEO,_[ _Precursive_](https://www.precursive.com)\n\n### Topics\n\n[opstech](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/opstech/)\n\n[operations](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/operations/)\n\n[business](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/business/)\n\n[bandwidth](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/bandwidth/)\n\n__Get Weekly News and Analysis\n\nSign up below to get the latest from ITProPortal, plus exclusive special\noffers, direct to your inbox!\n\nNo spam, we promise.
