Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nBusiness intelligence and analytics go hand in hand. By leveraging big data,\ncompanies have managed to make more efficient systems, develop better customer\nexperience and create more opportunities to increase their bottom line.\n\nOne of the more overlooked applications of big data is the generation of\ninsights for HR teams. However, companies are coming around to the reality\nthat skillful use of analytics can help their HR teams be more effective in\nfinding and onboarding talent. These 11 experts from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) delve into what their companies have\ndone to implement workforce analytics to help their HR departments be more in\ntune with the organization\u2019s employees.\n\nMembers explain why HR teams can benefit from studying their workforce\nanalytics.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Tracking Employee Engagement** ** **\n\nOur company uses a platform called Rhonda. Rhonda allows us to check in weekly\nwith our employees via text messages. Employees are able to rate their weekly\nexperiences. The managers are held accountable to check in with employees if\nthe employee scores low on their weekly work experience. It is invaluable to\nhave information in real time, open a dialogue and stop problems before they\nblossom. - [Patricia Sharkey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciasharkey/),[\nIMI People](http://www.imipeople.com/)\n\n**2\\. Measuring The Impact Of Learning**\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of training programs has always been a challenge.\nWe know[ 96% of L&D managers](https://leolearning.com/app/uploads/2019/02/LEO-\nLearning-Measuring-the-Business-Impact-Of-Learning-2019-Results.pdf) say they\nwant to measure learning impact, it\u2019s just that L&D and HR simply haven\u2019t had\naccess to the data to do it until now. Today, it\u2019s finally possible with the\nright technology, like machine learning, to gather the depth and dimension of\ndata to tie the impact of learning to business results. - [Andrea\nVrbanac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-vrbanac-chrl-2861ba53/),[ Axonify\nInc](http://www.axonify.com/)\n\n**3\\. Identifying The Optimal Path Forward**\n\nWith talent and organization high on the C-suite's agenda, using metrics and\ndashboards produced by organizational analytics enables HR leaders to be more\nresponsive to the business. It also allows them to deploy internal human\ncapital consulting teams whose members can be flexibly assigned to critical\nprojects that affect that business's organizational health. -[ Claudy\nJules](https://twitter.com/claudy-jules-ph-d-7939a3108),[\nGoogle](http://google.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Preventing Workplace Misconduct**\n\nInvestigations and employee behavioral data can hold the key to anticipating\nand fighting issues like sexual harassment and bias. Indicators on where\nemployee issues are occurring, what kind of issues are being reported, the\nnumbers of cases and more can be analyzed to predict trends, drive strategic\nplans and take preventative action across an organization. - [Deborah\nMuller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiemuller/),[ HR\nAcuity](http://www.hracuity.com/)\n\n**5\\. Identifying Red Flags**\n\nIf you collect data on a consistent basis (e.g. monthly people reviews) and\nask the right questions of your people managers, you will be able to identify\nred flags. This will help determine if you have employees who are struggling,\nflight risks or negatively impacting the team. - [Jeff\nBuenrostro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbuenrostro/),[ Metric\nTheory](http://www.metrictheory.com/)\n\n**6\\. Determining The Right Employee Benefits**\n\nOne area where workforce analytics really shine is the area of employee\nbenefits, employers' second largest expense after payroll. Understanding the\nutilization trends and correlating them with the employee churn data can help\nprovide insights into what benefits employees resonate with the most and\nallows employers to adjust toward more optimal experience to drive employee\nrecruitment and retention. -[ Rachel\nLyubovitzky](https://twitter.com/rlyubovitzky),[\nEverythingBenefits](http://www.everythingbenefits.com/)\n\n**7\\. Addressing Knowledge Gaps**\n\nWhen properly leveraging the power of people analytics, big data can help with\ninternal resource allocation, properly identify employee performance metrics,\nand assist with organizational and team culture. Addressing process\nbottlenecks or knowledge gaps that lead to employee disengagement, burnout and\nturnover can help HR teams build a stronger culture while creating lasting\nvalue. - [Erald Minga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eraldminga/), [Kellogg\nSchool of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)\n\n**8\\. Determining Upskilling Needs**\n\nMany employers struggle to find workers who possess the skills their roles\nrequire, resulting in unfilled positions and lost revenue. By leveraging big\ndata, employers can determine the roles their growing business will require in\nthe near future, and the skills necessary to succeed in those roles, allowing\nthem to offer training to current employees in advance and minimize future\nhiring costs. -[ John Feldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**9\\. Becoming Better Business Partners**\n\nWorkforce analytics can help HR become true business partners and gain a \"seat\nat the table.\" It allows HR to align data with people solutions that will help\nthe company thrive because better people strategies equal greater customer\nsatisfaction and higher revenues. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n**10\\. Improving Process Efficiency**\n\nHR wears many hats, and executives can't always see the connection between\nprograms. Utilizing metrics helps drive stronger performance, show ROI and get\nfurther buy-in for ongoing programs. Let's take process efficiency metrics for\nexample. Look at each step in the hiring process to determine what's broken,\nwhat pages are applicants dropping off, and then use that data to improve\ncompletion rate. -[ Nicole Smartt Serres](https://twitter.com/Nicole_Smartt),[\nStar Staffing](http://www.starhr.com/)\n\n**11\\. Helping Build High-Performing Organizations**\n\nIn a workday, there are myriad touch points between ourselves, others,\nfacilities, etc., which helps understand how we interact within the workplace\nand enables us to tailor better experiences. Data helps solve everyday\nproblems about engagement, hiring or behaviors/shifts in culture. Benefits\ninclude environments in which people can thrive and more effective, high-\nperforming organizations. - [Drew\nCarter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewc/),[ H.

In a\nworld where drowning in information is easier than actually pinpointing the\ndata we need, Priya Sunil covers all stages of the people analytics journey\nthrough conversations with leaders who walk the analytics talk.**\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the one-liner about numbers hiding as much as\nthey reveal, I\u2019m hoping you haven\u2019t heard this one yet: \u201cStatistics is the art\nof never having to say you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Perhaps the one-liner has some truth to\nit, as decisions today have become impossible without the right data.\n\nIn a world where information is easy to access, and in fact, available in a\ndeluge, having the right data at your fingertips is the difference between a\nslow and uncertain decision versus a prompt and 90%-sure decision.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, people analytics has become a hot topic among industry\nleaders today, with more businesses recognising the need for this approach.\nWherever you are in your people analytics journey \u2013 be it in the awareness\nstage, the early stage of implementation, or at the later stage where you\u2019re\nlooking to revamp your existing model \u2013 this feature is for you.\n\nThrough conversations with leaders who walk the talk in the industry, this\nfeature delves into the key questions you may have such as, does people\nanalytics need a big team? Not necessarily, as you\u2019ll learn through a chat\nwith **Daniel Kusmanto, ASM\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics**. What challenges can\nyou anticipate in the process? **Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and\nProjects, Brenntag Asia Pacific** , tells us. But before all that, what do you\nneed to first ask yourself before embarking on this journey, or revamping it?\nWe find out from **Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay**.\n\n**How people analytics turns data into meaningful insights**\n\n**_Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay, believes before implementing a\npeople analytics model, leaders need to ask the \u2018why\u2019 before working on the\n\u2018what\u2019. He shares his take on how companies are taking this approach today, in\nan interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nHaving the right talent gives companies a competitive advantage. Much of the\nresearch on what worries CEOs is around having the right talent in the\norganisation and the skills to do critical jobs. If so, then getting the right\ntalent, managing and engaging them will have a massive impact on companies\u2019\nability to not only do well and grow, but to also sustain for the long term.\n\nEvery decision around people becomes important, especially when we think about\nthe constant challenge around acquiring the best people for your organisation.\nA lot of decisions we make on people are based on data and facts \u2013 so, the\nbetter we get at decisions based on insights, the better the outcomes.\n\nIf people are a company\u2019s biggest asset, then companies need to make sure what\nthey do will have the best impact on both the company and their employees.\n\nThe adoption of people analytics arises from **the need to do what is right\nfor the business and its people** ; **increase fairness and transparency** ;\nand **looking at factors and variables that sometimes we, as humans, normally\ndo not think about or appreciate**.\n\n> ##### After all, if we base our business decisions on business analytics,\n> why shouldn\u2019t we make people decisions based on people analytics?\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ntend to face?**\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all. Each company is unique and in different stages\nof maturity in its journey. While there are some standard analytics models\nthat I think every company should look at, I do believe that each company must\nevaluate what kind of insights it needs to drive business performance through\nits talent, that is, the kind of talent management problems they have and what\nthe key HR challenges are. The analytics model and framework need to then\nensure they are meeting these needs.\n\nThere are two fundamental challenges that can come your way. First, the\n**availability and accuracy of data**. If we think about the availability of\ndata, we assume that companies have data but, what about the quality of data?\nIf the data going in is poor, incomplete and inaccurate, you cannot expect\ndeep insights to come out of it.\n\nSecond is **technology and the expertise to convert this data into insights**.\nWe have plenty of amazing tools and technology now that allow you to convert\nmassive data sets into easy-to-understand visual tools. Thus, if you don\u2019t\nhave people with expertise in understanding data and technology, it will be a\nstruggle. That is why you see this exponential increase in demand for data\nscientists and engineers, and numerous companies now coming up with analytics\ntools, given the high demand for such tools.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\n**My first advice is to ask yourself this: What exactly am I looking to solve\nthrough the use of people analytics?** There is no point in having a very\nfancy framework that gives 100 amazing visual reports if you don\u2019t know how\nthese reports will solve your business and HR challenges. Companies need to\nlink the business strategy to the HR strategy, identify the issues, and then\nsee what kind of data and insights will help them solve those.\n\n> ##### You cannot solve all problems through data, but you can still get a\n> lot out of it. The analytics approach has to be proactive rather than\n> reactive.\n\nYou also need to **ask the \u2018why\u2019 before you work on the \u2018what\u2019**. Get people\nwho understand data and can help create meaningful insights from the millions\nof data points.\n\nBased on my personal experience, you can look at one data set in a variety of\nways, which allows room for creativity \u2013 this field is not limited by any\nmeans. Ultimately, regardless of what model you choose, it must lead back to\nthe original challenge you are trying to solve.\n\nLast, as this is an evolving field, more technology and tools mean more data\nis created. **You need a framework that allows companies to constantly\nmonitor, adapt and evolve their analytics capability and reach**. What works\nnow will not work in two years\u2019 time, even in how companies are thinking\nthrough their approach and constantly linking their analytics models to solve\nbusiness and people challenges.\n\n* * *\n\n**People, process, and system: ASM\u2019s three pillars to a successful people\nanalytics transformation journey**\n\n**_At the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit\nby bit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the\n\u2018aha\u2019 moments daily, affirms Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR\nAnalytics, in this interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\nASM, a supplier of semiconductor process equipment for wafer processing,\nfounded in the Netherlands, believes in the importance of starting right. So\nwhen it started a people analytics team in 2017, the team comprised just one\nfull- time person \u2013 Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics.\nWhy? He explains: \u201cThere are companies that come in with a big bang; you\u2019ll\nsuddenly see in the newspaper they hired a head, and a bunch of analysts. But\nat ASM, we believe people analytics is more like a transformation journey that\ngrows organically. It\u2019s a bit hard when you\u2019ve started off big, and then you\nkeep measuring the ROI. You might even lose the idea of people analytics being\na journey and not a destination. After all, it is always good to travel light\nfor a long journey, right?\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, it is never easy to start off something that transforms the way\ndecisions about people are made in an organisation. In line with that, he\nhighlights the three key pillars of transformation \u2013 people, process, and\nsystem, emphasising the importance of HR and IT collaborating towards a common\nvision and moving forward as one in the analytics journey. \u201cWithout this\nalignment, it is an uphill battle to make progress.\u201d\n\nOn this journey, people are the hardest to transform. How was this challenge\ntackled? \u201cAs in marketing, we started off by segregating our target population\nand transforming them progressively, starting with the HRBPs who were\nconsidered one of the most important allies and important stakeholders that\ncan bring data and analytics to the discussion table with senior business\nleaders.\u201d\n\n> ##### In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should become more\n> like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and recognising\n> opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe next equally important segment is the HR leadership team,\nfollowing which, we should move beyond HR to people managers and eventually\nall employees.\u201d In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should\nbecome more like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and\nrecognising opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the midst of a casual talk or regular meeting with\ncolleagues, they may mention an issue they are facing \u2013 it can be in retaining\ntalent, recruitment or compensation. In these instances, it\u2019s important to\nidentify any opportunity where people analytics can help with. Something where\ndata can give them an insight into what is happening and what they can\npossibly do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit by\nbit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the \u2018aha\u2019\nmoments daily.\u201d Overall, he shares the transformation journey and the growth\nof people analytics at ASM has been \u201cquite successful\u201d and that although ROI\nis yet to be established in dollar-terms, there is still an impact on the\nbusiness. \u201cLooking back at where we started with HR data still scattered and\nnot much opportunities to retrieve insights, to today, where the results of\npeople analytics are being discussed at the highest level in the organisation,\nthus triggering cross- department initiatives \u2013 it is indeed great progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is quick to point out the firm is \u201cnot there yet\u201d. In fact, he\nbelieves there are many more uncharted territories in the organisation where\npeople analytics can play a more significant role, such as workforce planning,\norganisational effectiveness, and so on.\n\nMoving forward, he emphasises that people analytics leaders, as disruptors to\nHR\u2019s traditional way of working, are being disrupted as well by ready-made\nanalytics capabilities that come with HR technology platforms.\n\n\u201cHence, we need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\nbusiness knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down a\ngeneric business question on people (e.g. if we have more headcount, why are\nthe machines still producing the same amount and how can we boost this?) to\nmany granular questions that, in the end, can be answered (perhaps not at 100%\nconfidence and it will be in terms of probability) with people data and\nanalytics.\u201d\n\n> ##### We need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\n> business knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down\n> a generic business question on people\n\n* * *\n\n**How to create enriching career conversations through data**\n\n**_For Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and Projects, Brenntag Asia\nPacific, people analytics is about the ability to gather and combine data to\ntell meaningful stories and gain insights about a specific situation and about\npeople. He shares more in this short interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nThe needs vary, and include: boosting sales revenue; penetrating a new market;\nstudying customer buying trends; measuring customer satisfaction levels;\nenhancing the current supply chain and distribution network; hiring and\ndeveloping talent; succession planning; career management; reducing staff\nattrition; driving performance and company culture, and engaging a\nmultigenerational workforce.\n\nAt Google, for instance, the firm\u2019s Project Oxygen uses people analytics to\nuncover the practices of its best managers and provides coaching sessions for\nlow performers. While at Dell, analytics is used to increase the success of\nits sales force.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) uses people analytics to\nidentify the traits of great managers, and leverages that for their\ndevelopment. RBC also uses internal and customer data to diagnose reasons for\nthe performing and non-performing branches, regions or product innovation.\n\nBack home, Singapore is investing in becoming a SMART nation. The key pillars\nto support this are a digital economy, digital government, and digital\nsociety. Our people, our companies and our public agencies all have a role to\nplay in this transformation by becoming a value-creating nation going forward,\nversus a value-adding one.\n\nOverall, it is about the ability to gather and combine data to tell meaningful\nstories and gain insights about a specific situation and about people, while\nallowing you to plan interventions that will solve key organisational\nchallenges and, ultimately, drive business outcomes.\n\n**Q Based on your experience across industries, what key factors form the\nbasis of each industry\u2019s needs?**\n\nPeople make things happen. It is an opportunity to create self-awareness for\nthe organisation and employees around people analytics and what it can do for\nthem, and, in doing so, engage them to play their part. It is also about\nunderstanding and gaining insights, for example, about people\u2019s behaviours,\nforecasting trends and predicting events for better decision-making, to name\nsome.\n\nUnderstanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\nconversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations. This is\nstrategic in developing talent initiatives to achieve organisational goals,\nengaging the hearts and minds of employees, and building that ultimate\nemployee experience that promotes the company brand.\n\n> ##### Understanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\n> conversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations.\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ncome across?**\n\nThe first challenge lies in combining accurate and clean data from various\nsystems, in order to mine valuable insights and interpretation of the\nemployee\u2019s behaviour and journey. Another challenge is in ensuring sound\ngovernance around how the data is processed, used and kept with compliance to\nthe local data security and privacy policy.\n\nIn my view, the next challenge is around building understanding and commitment\nto change as part of the communication strategy and change management.\nFinally, the challenge also lies in developing the competencies and skills of\nthe HR professionals and employees who use the data to support decision-\nmaking.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\nFirms intending to embark on this rewarding and exciting journey are advised\nto begin with a road map. Asking the right questions will lead to actionable\ninsights, while setting a vision with clear goals provides clarity of\ndirection about what you want to achieve. Organisations should also be able to\nidentify the support required and assemble the team members who are passionate\nabout analytics.\n\nIn managing the expectations and communicating the need for change, HR is\npresented with an opportunity to diagnose, and build understanding and\ncommitment to change for the organisation. First, begin with one or two key\ninitiatives that will solve key organisational challenges and witness the ROI\nin the journey to get buy-in, and establish credibility in the process.\n\nFurther, firms who wish to revamp their existing people analytics model are\nadvised to look critically at what areas have worked well, what has not, and\nwhat can be stopped. The important takeaways are, overall, the rich lessons\nlearnt as an organisation, as a team and as an individual through the\nexperience. This will provide guidance in the road map for the next phase of\nyour people analytics journey.\n\nWe are living in a data-driven economy. Data is now readily available,\ncomplemented by many tools being developed in the market to boost analytics\ncapabilities and cater to the interest in big data. Progressive companies see\nthe advantage of leveraging people data to make better decisions, managing\npeople at work, and reaping the benefits of implementing a people analytics\nstrategy.\n\n* * *\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources Online\u2019s January-February 2020\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the Malaysia\nmagazine.

process, and system: ASM's three pillars to a successful people\nanalytics transformation journey\n\n[HR

It happens bit\nby bit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the\n\u2018aha\u2019 moments daily, affirms Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR\nAnalytics, in this interview with Priya Sunil.\n\nASM, a supplier of semiconductor process equipment for wafer processing,\nfounded in the Netherlands, believes in the importance of starting right. So\nwhen it started a people analytics team in 2017, the team comprised just one\nfull- time person \u2013 Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics.\nWhy? He explains: \u201cThere are companies that come in with a big bang; you\u2019ll\nsuddenly see in the newspaper they hired a head, and a bunch of analysts. But\nat ASM, we believe people analytics is more like a transformation journey that\ngrows organically. It\u2019s a bit hard when you\u2019ve started off big, and then you\nkeep measuring the ROI. You might even lose the idea of people analytics being\na journey and not a destination. After all, it is always good to travel light\nfor a long journey, right?\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, it is never easy to start off something that transforms the way\ndecisions about people are made in an organisation. In line with that, he\nhighlights the three key pillars of transformation \u2013 people, process, and\nsystem, emphasising the importance of HR and IT collaborating towards a common\nvision and moving forward as one in the analytics journey. \u201cWithout this\nalignment, it is an uphill battle to make progress.\u201d\n\nOn this journey, people are the hardest to transform. How was this challenge\ntackled? \u201cAs in marketing, we started off by segregating our target population\nand transforming them progressively, starting with the HRBPs who were\nconsidered one of the most important allies and important stakeholders that\ncan bring data and analytics to the discussion table with senior business\nleaders.\u201d\n\n> ##### In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should become more\n> like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and recognising\n> opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe next equally important segment is the HR leadership team,\nfollowing which, we should move beyond HR to people managers and eventually\nall employees.\u201d In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should\nbecome more like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and\nrecognising opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the midst of a casual talk or regular meeting with\ncolleagues, they may mention an issue they are facing \u2013 it can be in retaining\ntalent, recruitment or compensation. In these instances, it\u2019s important to\nidentify any opportunity where people analytics can help with. Something where\ndata can give them an insight into what is happening and what they can\npossibly do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit by\nbit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the \u2018aha\u2019\nmoments daily.\u201d Overall, he shares the transformation journey and the growth\nof people analytics at ASM has been \u201cquite successful\u201d and that although ROI\nis yet to be established in dollar-terms, there is still an impact on the\nbusiness. \u201cLooking back at where we started with HR data still scattered and\nnot much opportunities to retrieve insights, to today, where the results of\npeople analytics are being discussed at the highest level in the organisation,\nthus triggering cross- department initiatives \u2013 it is indeed great progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is quick to point out the firm is \u201cnot there yet\u201d. In fact, he\nbelieves there are many more uncharted territories in the organisation where\npeople analytics can play a more significant role, such as workforce planning,\norganisational effectiveness, and so on.\n\nMoving forward, he emphasises that people analytics leaders, as disruptors to\nHR\u2019s traditional way of working, are being disrupted as well by ready-made\nanalytics capabilities that come with HR technology platforms.\n\n\u201cHence, we need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\nbusiness knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down a\ngeneric business question on people (e.g. if we have more headcount, why are\nthe machines still producing the same amount and how can we boost this?) to\nmany granular questions that, in the end, can be answered (perhaps not at 100%\nconfidence and it will be in terms of probability) with people data and\nanalytics.\u201d\n\n> ##### We need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\n> business knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down\n> a generic business question on people\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published as part of a feature in[Human Resources Online\u2019s\nJanuary-February 2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of\nthe Singapore magazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the\nMalaysia magazine.

With the rise in AI and machine learning, the job of using\nthese effectively can feel impossible.\n\nIf you are a human resources professional who needs to leverage this kind of\ntechnology to help make better decisions about your organization's people,\ndon't worry: you don't need to be a data scientist to impact your\norganization.\n\nThe real gap in moving people analytics forward lies, not just in getting more\ndata scientists, but in giving the people experts the skills they need to ask\nthe right questions of the data, and then turning those insights into a story\nthat will engage, resonate, and encourage stakeholders to take action.\n\n## **HR Business Partners (HRBPs) as Data Translators**\n\nIt's this reason why, by 2026, the [McKinsey Global\nInstitute](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-\ninsights/analytics-translator) estimates that demand for \"data translators\" in\nthe United States alone may reach two to four million. Translators are not\ndata scientists; instead, they bridge the technical expertise with the\noperational knowledge of marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, risk, and\nother frontline managers.\n\nIn the HR context, this means mapping statistics back to meaningful stories,\nsuch as how turnover impacts innovation, revenue, or customer satisfaction.\nWithin HR, HRBPs are in the perfect position to play this role. Their mandate\nis to work closely with an organization's senior leaders to develop a people\nagenda that firmly supports the overall aims of the organization\u2014my training\non being an active business partner centered on asking the most powerful and\nimpactful questions. As a data translator, we can now more effectively help\nanswer those questions.\n\nAs we have found, successful people analytics adopters have taken an approach\nwhere statistics-heavy specialists will do the intensive part of the research.\nStill, the HRBPs will own the process of highlighting the impactful questions,\nand telling the story to inform and engage stakeholders on the answers.\n\n## **Challenge of Working With Data**\n\nEven though an in-depth knowledge of programming languages and statistics is\nnot necessary, there is still a learning curve for data-aspiring HRBPs. The\nchallenge appears to be two-pronged: technical and strategic.\n\nOn the one hand, HRBPs have not finished the transformation to become more\ncomfortable with metrics and data. While demands for this type of analysis and\ninformation are entering the mainstream, nonetheless, these demands represent\na recent change for the human resources function.\n\nThe other challenge has less to do with numbers and more to do with\nunderstanding the business. \"In my future research on people analytics\nenablement, I spoke with numerous organizations that reported less than 25% of\ntheir HRBPs understood the businesses they support. Instead of providing\nstrategic insight, many HRBPs still operate more as administrative aides to\nthe business and prefer to handle employee relations problems,\" writes [Lexy\nMartin](https://www.visier.com/clarity/secure-the-right-hr-business-partner-\nmanager-for-the-future/), a respected thought leader on HR technology\nadoption.\n\n**Becoming more business and numbers-savvy is no easy feat. But here are some\ntips you can start using today:**\n\n### **Start the Journey**\n\n  \nBecoming savvy in your business is a journey of constant exploration. Markets\nchange, business strategies change, and competitors rise and fall. You cannot\nknow it all nor become an expert overnight. So make having conversations with\na diverse set of business leaders across your organization a priority. Be\ncurious and understand what matters most to them and how people impact their\nsuccess.\n\n### **Measure What Matters**\n\n  \nWhen it comes to being data-driven, you don't need to boil the ocean right\naway. Start by finding something specific (such as turnover) that you care\nabout. Dig deep enough to become an expert on the topic by gaining an\nunderstanding of how the data changes over time, by tenure, for high or low\nperformers. What patterns can you discover in the data?\n\n### **Connect to the Business**\n\n  \nHR leaders know the importance of understanding the business. Oftentimes, not\ngetting that aligned with the data will send you off into a discussion that is\nnot important. Asking the powerful right question is at the heart of being a\ngreat business partner, and working with data is no different. How does\ndiversity impact hiring? How does hiring impact our business? Data on people\ngoes from interesting to business-critical when you can connect people's\ndecisions to business outcomes.\n\n### **Walk Away From the Data**\n\n  \nOne of the top experts in the field of data storytelling is Cole Nussbaumer\nKnaflic. Before becoming the bestselling author of Storytelling With Data, she\nspent over a decade refining her skills through analytical roles in banking,\nprivate equity, and at Google.\n\nSpeaking at Visier Outsmart, a conference for data-driven leaders, Knaflic\ndemonstrated how a story arc forms a bridge from our short term memory to our\nlong term memory.\n\nIt can be challenging to distill the data into a tidy narrative structure. But\nas Knaflic recommends, once the analysis is complete, put all the data aside\nand talk it over with a colleague. Remember that data is evidence, and you\nhave to tell the story to win the case. Stories are how we engage people, and\nin the case of data, you need to act like an investigative journalist - a data\njournalist who tells their story with data.\n\n### **Include \"So That\" in Your Statements**\n\n  \nAlso, during Visier's Outsmart, Dave Ulrich (widely known as the father of\nmodern HR) shared a little trick to ensure you are connecting your insights to\nthe business. If you want business leaders to pay attention, include the\nphrase \"so that\" in reviewing and sharing your story. Business leaders are\nlooking for business impact and asking, \"so that\" forces you to understand and\nexplain the effects. But the phrase also makes people pay closer attention\nbecause conclusions force them to evaluate whether they agree or disagree with\nyour findings. Remember, you are the expert, so share your expertise rather\nthan just the data presented in a strictly factual manner.\n\n**Learn More:[HR in 2020: Reskilling Goes Into\nOverdrive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/hr-\nin-2020-reskilling-goes-into-overdrive/)**\n\n### **Prompt with a Question**\n\n  \nOne of the best ways to contextualize data is to start from the business\nquestion. We use data to help us make better decisions. It is evidence that\ninforms our choices, but without understanding what decision we are making or\nwhat challenges we are facing, you cannot apply the right data to the right\nproblem. The easiest way to make this connection is to start with the right\nquestion.\n\nFor example, when evaluating compensation, there can be many opportunities.\nAre you concerned you are paying above or below the market? Is it impacting\nyour ability to hire? That you are not fostering a pay for performance\nculture? Which question you are focusing on can both narrow the data work, but\njust as importantly, it makes it easy for your audience to participate in the\ndiscussion and decision.\n\nThe demand for people analytics skills is not going away any time soon. Today\nthe HR team is no longer asked to provide data; Instead, it is requested to\nprovide input on what the data means as well as recommendations for\ninterventions. This is only going to continue, as studies have shown that\n\"people analytics\" was one of the fields with the highest increase in expected\nimpact among HR professionals. By empowering HRBPs with data now,\norganizations can be prepared to tackle the future of work head-on.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Engage Generation Z in Workplace Learning &\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nto-engage-generation-z-in-workplace-learning-development/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Transform+HR+Data+Into+Business+Results\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Transform+HR+Data+Into+Business+Results&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Transform HR Data Into Business\nResults&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-transform-hr-data-into-business-\nresult%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

Q&A: How people analytics turns data into meaningful insights\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### Sajjad Parmar _, Head of Reward APAC, eBay, believes before implementing a\npeople analytics model, leaders need to ask the \u2018why\u2019 before working on the\n\u2018what\u2019. He shares his take on how companies are taking this approach today, in\nan interview with Priya Sunil._\n\n### Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm's people\nanalytics model?\n\nHaving the right talent gives companies a competitive advantage. Much of the\nresearch on what worries CEOs is around having the right talent in the\norganisation and the skills to do critical jobs. If so, then getting the right\ntalent, managing and engaging them will have a massive impact on companies\u2019\nability to not only do well and grow, but to also sustain for the long term.\n\nEvery decision around people becomes important, especially when we think about\nthe constant challenge around acquiring the best people for your organisation.\nA lot of decisions we make on people are based on data and facts \u2013 so, the\nbetter we get at decisions based on insights, the better the outcomes.\n\nIf people are a company\u2019s biggest asset, then companies need to make sure what\nthey do will have the best impact on both the company and their employees.\n\nThe adoption of people analytics arises from **the need to do what is right\nfor the business and its people** ; **increase fairness and transparency** ;\nand **looking at factors and variables that sometimes we, as humans, normally\ndo not think about or appreciate**.\n\n> ##### After all, if we base our business decisions on business analytics,\n> why shouldn\u2019t we make people decisions based on people analytics?\n\n### Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ntend to face?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all. Each company is unique and in different stages\nof maturity in its journey. While there are some standard analytics models\nthat I think every company should look at, I do believe that each company must\nevaluate what kind of insights it needs to drive business performance through\nits talent, that is, the kind of talent management problems they have and what\nthe key HR challenges are. The analytics model and framework need to then\nensure they are meeting these needs.\n\nThere are two fundamental challenges that can come your way. First, the\n**availability and accuracy of data**. If we think about the availability of\ndata, we assume that companies have data but, what about the quality of data?\nIf the data going in is poor, incomplete and inaccurate, you cannot expect\ndeep insights to come out of it.\n\nSecond is **technology and the expertise to convert this data into insights**.\nWe have plenty of amazing tools and technology now that allow you to convert\nmassive data sets into easy-to-understand visual tools. Thus, if you don\u2019t\nhave people with expertise in understanding data and technology, it will be a\nstruggle. That is why you see this exponential increase in demand for data\nscientists and engineers, and numerous companies now coming up with analytics\ntools, given the high demand for such tools.\n\n### Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?\n\n**My first advice is to ask yourself this: What exactly am I looking to solve\nthrough the use of people analytics?** There is no point in having a very\nfancy framework that gives 100 amazing visual reports if you don\u2019t know how\nthese reports will solve your business and HR challenges. Companies need to\nlink the business strategy to the HR strategy, identify the issues, and then\nsee what kind of data and insights will help them solve those.\n\n> ##### You cannot solve all problems through data, but you can still get a\n> lot out of it. The analytics approach has to be proactive rather than\n> reactive.\n\nYou also need to **ask the \u2018why\u2019 before you work on the \u2018what\u2019**. Get people\nwho understand data and can help create meaningful insights from the millions\nof data points.\n\nBased on my personal experience, you can look at one data set in a variety of\nways, which allows room for creativity \u2013 this field is not limited by any\nmeans. Ultimately, regardless of what model you choose, it must lead back to\nthe original challenge you are trying to solve.\n\nLast, as this is an evolving field, more technology and tools mean more data\nis created. **You need a framework that allows companies to constantly\nmonitor, adapt and evolve their analytics capability and reach**. What works\nnow will not work in two years\u2019 time, even in how companies are thinking\nthrough their approach and constantly linking their analytics models to solve\nbusiness and people challenges.\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published as part of a feature in[Human Resources Online\u2019s\nJanuary-February 2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of\nthe Singapore magazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the\nMalaysia magazine.

For\nmore coverage, see our coronavirus [hub](/coronavirus)_\n\nWHEN THE financial crisis rocked the business world in 2007-09, boardrooms\nturned to corporate finance chiefs. A good CFO could save a company; a bad one\nmight bury it. The covid-19 pandemic presents a different challenge\u2014and\nhighlights the role of another corporate function, often unfairly dismissed as\nsoft. Never before have more firms needed a hard-headed HR boss.\n\nThe duties of chief people officers, as human-resources heads are sometimes\ncalled, look critical right now. They must keep employees healthy; maintain\ntheir morale; oversee a vast remote-working experiment; and, as firms\nretrench, consider whether, when and how to lay workers off. Their in-trays\nare bulging.\n\nOnce derided as \u201cpay and parties\u201d managers, by the early 1990s HR chiefs\nturned to compliance, keeping firms out of the courts (and papers). A\nsubsequent string of corporate imbroglios elevated their status, notes Patrick\nWright of the University of South Carolina. In the wake of executive-pay\nscandals at companies such as WorldCom and Tyco in the 2000s they became more\ninvolved in remuneration. A decade later bungled successions, for example at\nHP, a printer-maker which sacked two bosses in as many years, left them with a\nbigger say in filling top jobs. In the past few years they have dealt with\ncompanies\u2019 often very public \u201cme too\u201d troubles.\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200328_WBC877.png)\n\nAs recruiting and retaining skilled workers became chief executives\u2019 big\npreoccupation\u2014four-fifths now worry about skill shortages, up from half in\n2012\u2014HR heads\u2019 desks moved ever closer to the corner office. Today many reside\nright next to the boss. Shareholders are inviting more outside HR chiefs to\nboards. In America their salaries remain lower than CFOs\u2019 but have risen 20%\nfaster since 2010 (see chart).\n\nA higher profile entails new expectations. HR was once the domain of history\ngraduates and masters in labour relations; nowadays plenty hold business\ndegrees. Although most firms recruit them from HR jobs, more are choosing\noutsiders or unconventional candidates. According to Russell Reynolds\nAssociates, an executive-search firm, HR heads appointed to Fortune 100\ncompanies between 2016 and 2019 were around 50% likelier than earlier hires to\nhave worked abroad, in general management or in finance.\n\nBefore covid-19, tight labour markets and empowered employees pressed\nemployers to understand how to get the most out of their staff, says Dane\nHolmes, a former head of human-capital management at Goldman Sachs, an\ninvestment bank, who now runs an HR-analytics firm. Diane Gherson, who runs HR\nat IBM, overhauled the computing giant\u2019s performance management using big\ndata. Algorithms now challenge IBM managers\u2019 instincts on pay and promotion,\nand alert Ms Gherson\u2019s team when staff are at risk of fleeing (often before\nthey realise it themselves).\n\nThe pandemic makes such \u201cpeople analytics\u201d more relevant. Beth Galetti, Ms\nGherson\u2019s opposite number at Amazon, an engineer with no HR experience before\njoining the e-commerce titan, oversees 1,000 developers working exclusively on\nHR software. Amazon\u2019s pre-outbreak investment in digital induction for fresh\nhires is paying off. \u201cWe on-boarded 1,700 new corporate employees on [March\n16th] alone,\u201d Ms Galetti reports.\n\nCovid-19 may lead more HR chiefs to adopt such systems. In the short run many\nhave more pressing problems. Mala Singh, chief people officer at EA, a maker\nof video games, represents the c-suite on the team tasked with pandemic\nresponse. This now occupies 60-70% of her (long) day. Her team has been\ngetting staff desks, computers, even noise-cancelling headphones. A bigger\nconcern was balancing work with child care. Ms Singh told the caregivers on EA\nstaff to take as much time as they need to adapt without using up paid leave.\nShe is digitally monitoring employee sentiment, particularly anxiety. In a\ncreative business like EA\u2019s, \u201chaving someone stressed about their family\nsituation does not enable productive work\u201d, she explains.\n\nMany companies, especially outside the knowledge economy, face tougher\nchoices. HR leaders must strike a balance between a firm\u2019s professed purpose,\nwhich these days often involves treating staff decently, and the bottom line,\nobserves Dan Kaplan of Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The instinct is to cut costs\nthrough mass redundancies, as some hotel chains, airlines and others have\nbegun doing. Rather than slash payrolls indiscriminately, says Bill Schaninger\nof McKinsey, another consultancy, good HR heads can use the crisis to\nreconfigure company workflow: what needs to be done by whom, what can be\nautomated and what requires people to share the same space. Some workers who\nat first appear redundant may be redeployed or reskilled.\n\nThe most far-sighted HR-ers at the most resilient companies are already\nstarting to look beyond the flattened curve. Although not quite\nrecruiting\u2014times are too uncertain\u2014Ms Gherson has begun to court talent at\nrival firms. Now that everyone is working from home, she says, no one is\nlistening in on their calls. For a savvy HR chief, \u201cit\u2019s the perfect\nopportunity.\u201d\n\n **Dig deeper:**  \nFor our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for _The Economist\nToday_ , our daily [newsletter](/newslettersignup), or visit our [coronavirus\nhub](/coronavirus)\n\n[Reuse this\ncontent](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=The%20coronavirus%20crisis%20thrusts%20corporate%20HR%20chiefs%20into%20the%20spotlight&publicationDate=2020-03-24&contentID=%2Fcontent%2F8b6kdhivneejfplvt8h4t27jvgvlbjmq&type=A&orderBeanReset=TRUE)[The\nTrust Project](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n\n## More from Business\n\n### [Bartleby  \nJobs for jailbirds](/business/2020/04/04/jobs-for-jailbirds)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBD001_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Great white night  \nGovernments are once again splurging to keep big companies\nafloat](/business/2020/04/03/governments-are-once-again-splurging-to-keep-big-\ncompanies-afloat)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBP003_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Up in the air  \nBoeing ponders its bail-out options](/business/2020/04/03/boeing-ponders-its-\nbail-out-options)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200404_WBP504.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n## The best of our journalism, handpicked each day\n\nSign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today\n\n[Sign up now](https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter)\n\n![A hand holding a newspaper](/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg)\n\n  * [Subscribe](https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/Footer)\n  * [Group subscriptions](https://groupsubscriptions.economist.com)\n  * [Help](https://www.economist.com/help/home)\n\n## Keep updated\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/theeconomist)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-economist)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/economistmagazine)\n  * [RSS](https://www.economist.com/rss)\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in _\u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d_\n\n## Apps & media\n\n  * [The Economist apps](https://www.economist.com/apps)\n  * [Economist Films](https://films.economist.com)\n  * [Podcasts](https://www.economist.com/blogs/podcasts)\n\n## Other publications\n\n  * [1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com)\n  * [The World in](https://theworldin.economist.com/)\n  * [The World If](https://www.economist.com/worldif18)\n\n## The Economist\n\n  * [About](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n  * [Advertise](http://marketingsolutions.economist.com)\n  * [Press centre](https://press.economist.com)\n\n## The Economist Group\n\n  * [Economist Group](https://www.economistgroup.com/)\n  * [The Economist Store](https://shop.economist.com)\n  * [Careers](https://economistgroupcareers.com)\n  * [Which MBA?](https://www.economist.com/whichmba)\n  * [GMAT Tutor](https://gmat.economist.com/)\n  * [GRE Tutor](https://gre.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Jobs](http://jobs.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Education Navigator](https://execed.economist.com)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.economist.com/legal/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/privacy)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html)\n  * [Manage Cookies](https://l3.evidon.com/site/2254/668/6?lang=en-gb)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.economist.com/help/accessibilitypolicy)\n  * [Modern Slavery Statement](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/guiding_principles.html)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](http://privacyportal.economist.com/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

From\nan HR perspective, professionals continue to struggle with ways to keep their\norganizations successful and their employees engaged.  The reality is tough\ndecisions must be made and will need to be made in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, however, HR has an opportunity to take the crisis and draw\nnew data from it daily.  How is the organization performing?  Are employees\nengaged?  Are they productive?  How is leadership fairing?\n\nIn our recorded interview, the HR Curator himself - Dave Millner-- joins us.\nDuring our discussion, we take a look at the coronavirus and its impact on\nboth the United States and the United Kingdom. Millner also looks into his\n\"crystal ball\" in an attempt to predict what the future of work will look like\nas a result of the pandemic.

It\u2019s all very\nwell having the latest flash system in place to keep tabs on your workforce,\nbut if you as a business owner are unclear on what the resulting data means,\nor how you might best interpret it to bring benefit to your workers, then\nyou\u2019ll struggle to derive much advantage from it. When it comes to hot-button\ntopics such as absence intelligence, this is especially pertinent. Most\nbusinesses track when their employees are off unexpectedly. Some might flag\nparticularly noticeable trends to HR or make it part of a feedback session.\nBut very few understand how to access insight into day-to-day absence data\nwhich can help them provide better working experience for employees and also\nmaximize their own profitability.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nYour attendance tracker throws up that a particular employee has had four days\noff in one month. But do you have the full picture? What if you knew it was\nthe same day of the week every time? That might indicate a pattern; perhaps\nthe employee is juggling childcare on that day - you could sit down and work\nout a solution for both parties.\n\nWith proper absence reporting, you can quickly create a picture for an\nindividual employee, or even further by team, location, country or office.\nThese reports can give you clear visibility of employee absence across\ndifferent areas; interpreting that data is a different story. Here are the\nthree key ways which I\u2019d recommend every business owner and/or HR team puts\ninto practice, in order to gain stronger intelligence across the workforce:\n\n## **Put a number on it**\n\nTwo different employees may take the exact same amount of sick days across a 6\nmonth period, but this could be for completely different reasons, and the\npotential consequences for your business are markedly different too. Two weeks\noff after a medical operation, versus consistently missing every other Tuesday\n- you\u2019d be right in thinking that the long term disruption risk is very much\nfrom the second case. In this way, \u2018Bradford Factor\u2019 scoring is a useful way\nto act on absence data.\n\nThe Bradford Factor supports the principle that repeat absences have a greater\noperational impact than the long term sick. You can calculate an employee's\nBradford Factor using the Bradford Formula, which is: S x S x D = B. 'S' is\nthe total number of separate absences, 'D' is the total number of days'\nabsence and 'B' is the Bradford Factor score. The higher the number, the more\nattention you need to pay to an employee, even if their absences are in total\nnot extreme.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Measure Workplace\nProductivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\nmeasure-workplace-productivity/)**\n\n## **Look forward as well as backward**\n\nA trend businesses might not think about too deeply is this. Who\u2019s going to be\nin trouble six months\u2019 time?\u2019 By this, I mean that a worker who isn\u2019t taking\nany leave isn\u2019t a good thing. It means they\u2019re probably going to a) burn out\nand need a chunk of time off to recover, or b) stockpile their holiday to the\nend of the year and leave you with significant staffing issues.\n\nThis is where having strong absence intelligence, through understanding and\nanticipating your workers\u2019 needs down the line, can really help. If someone\nhasn\u2019t had a break for six months, it\u2019s worth raising it with them and\nrecommending some (well deserved) holiday. You can also create a holiday\nreport for your business that shows everyone who is on annual leave during a\ncertain month, allowing you to easily plan for future projects.\n\nThis also works around areas like returning to work; helping minimize the\namount of time that someone you see has had a significant amount of leave\nneeds to get back into the rhythm of your workplace is something you\ndefinitely don\u2019t want to leave too late.\n\n## **See where you can help workers help themselves**\n\nYou can point employees in the right direction to help them help themselves,\nand by extension the business, if your data can help identify who might be at\nparticular risk of frequent unexplained absence. In this case, doctors'\nappointments and sick days are a prime example. Someone who has had very\nlittle leave in a period of six months, only to take three lots of leave in a\ntwo month period, for example, could well have had something happen in their\nday to day life which is causing significant disruption.\n\n**Learn More:[Absence Isn\u2019t Hurting Your Business: Absence Management\nIs](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/absence-isnt-hurting-\nyour-business-absence-management-is-2/)**\n\nBy looking deeply into your absence data, you might see that some workers are\nrequiring frequent time off for medical reasons. The employee\u2019s needs come\nfirst, but you can help both parties by encouraging or making available the\nopportunity to work from home, take flexible hours or take phone appointments\nin the office. Additionally, you can actually preempt employees\u2019 requirements;\nproviding health-based resources via your company HR system to anyone who has\nan absence for their health so that they\u2019re better prepared for the future.\n\nTaking your absence intelligence seriously is a good opportunity to show\nemployees that you care and at the same time maximize their productivity for\nthe company.\n\n_Are you taking your absence intelligence seriously?

News:**[Clarity Benefit Solutions Unveils New Features; Strengthens\nExecutive Team](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/compensation-\nbenefits/clarity-benefit-solutions-unveils-new-features-strengthens-executive-\nteam/)\n\nIn recent weeks, millions of employees around the world have been forced to\nwork from home for the foreseeable future in conditions that are severely\nimpacting their individual and team productivity. Even though technologies for\nremote employee collaboration, such as video conferencing and virtual shared\nworking spaces, are enabling businesses to continue working, managers are\nunable to fully understand and measure how these new conditions are impacting\nthe performance and overall state-of-mind of their employees.\n\n[Nemesysco](http://www.nemesysco.com) voice analytics solution for monitoring\nemployee wellness is built around the company\u2019s core Layered Voice Analysis\n(LVA\u2122) technology. The LVA technology is designed to reveal the genuine\nemotional state of a person by detecting and measuring uncontrolled\npsychophysiological changes to a person\u2019s voice during open conversations.\n\nFor remote employee wellness monitoring, the LVA technology runs in the\nbackground during real-time or recorded conversations with employees. The\ntechnology initially establishes a baseline for each monitored employee and\nmonitors for changes in emotions relevant to the workplace, such as stress,\nfrustration, fatigue motivation, and enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWe have been a channel partner of Nemesysco here in Hungary for many years\nand the human resources space is currently the strongest market we are\nserving,\u201d said Gy\u00f6rgy Kis, CEO at ANIMA Polygraph Ltd. \u201cMany of our customers,\nespecially in the banking and insurance sector, who traditionally use the\nNemesysco technology to improve their recruiting processes, are now applying\nthe technology to better understand the mindset of their employees who are now\nforced to work from home in a critical effort to maintain the continuity of\ntheir businesses and the services they provide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis strong interest we are currently experiencing for remote employee\nwellness monitoring is coming from both government organizations and\nenterprises across the Far East, India, Europe, and Mexico. Many of our call\ncenter customers have also recently expanded their use of our voice analytics\ntechnology to monitor the emotional wellness of their agents who are now\nworking remotely from home,\u201d explained Amir Liberman, CEO of Nemesysco. \u201cThese\nnew customers initially approached us with the immediate need to ensure\nbusiness continuity as they rapidly transitioned their employees to work from\nhome and many are also telling us that they want to be prepared for the new\nrealities of remote working that will likely continue afterward.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to help businesses and government organizations to ensure\nbusiness continuity while their employees are working from home and other\nremote locations, Nemesysco is currently offering a free, no-obligation trial\nof its recently released InTone solution.

They are responsible for succession planning, which refers to identifying the potential new leaders, career development for the employees and also to improve the inter-organizational mobility.\n  * Enhancing individual and organizational performance by developing competencies.\n  * They are responsible for tying competencies to compensation and performance appraisal\n  * They are responsible for the management of the implementation and integration of technology with the help of better staffing and training.\n\n## What is HR Analytics?\n\nHuman Resources Analytics is the field of analytics that deals with people\nanalysis and also deals with the application of the analytical process to the\nhuman capital/workforce in order to improve employee performance.\n\nIn other words, Human Resource Analytics is a methodology to help HRs gain\ninsight on how the human capital assets contribute to the 4 main successful\noutcomes of a company\n\n  * Generating Revenue\n  * Minimizing Experiences\n  * Mitigation risks\n  * Executing strategic plans\n\nHere are a few [HR Analytics](https://www.goco.io/blog/articles/hr-analytics-\nbest-practices/) that HR Managers should be aware of:\n\n  * Employee Churn Rate:\n\nWhen it comes to human capital/human resource the investments involved in it\nare huge and this applies to every organization. The process of assessing your\nworkforce turnover rate is called employee churn rate. The churn rate helps\nthe HR managers predict the future and they can use that information to\nimplement changes and reduce employee churn.\n\n  * Absence Rates:\n\nHR Departments can use employee analytics to determine the health of employees\nby absenteeism reporting. This kind of analysis can help you breakdown the\ntotal number of leaves taken by who and when, and that in turn will help you\ndetermine who took sick leaves genuinely and who didn\u2019t. That helps you in\nmaking changes in the company\u2019s workforce and maximize productivity.\n\n  * Capability Analytics:\n\nThe management process that helps you identify the core competencies of the\nworkforce is called capability analytics. As it goes without saying the\nsuccess and failure of an organization also depends upon the skill and\nexpertise of the employees. This helps the HR manager create benchmarks based\non the current performances by the employees, helps the HR manager identify\ngaps in performances and make strategic changes accordingly.\n\n  * Revenue\n\nRevenue per employee speaks a lot about the employee and helps you understand\nwhere your business is progressing. It also helps them get an idea about their\nstaffing ratio which can indicate if the company is in a position to meet\ntheir goals. Though not every job in a company will have a direct impact on\nthe revenue, this is just a metric for companies to understand their\nefficiency.\n\n## How Can HR Data be Helpful?\n\nHR data is one of the most vital assets, it allows you to predict patterns in\ndata, allows you to understand those changes, and makes strategic changes\naccordingly, with all this at play the HR manager can make an informed\ndecision.\n\nIt can be leveraged to impact the company\u2019s culture and optimize the process.\nBut more than anything, HR Data allows you to understand the employees.\n\n## How to Gather the right data?\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world there are numerous applications and technological\nsolutions that an organization can invest in. This would help in gaining a\nunified view of critical HR Data.\n\nAn HR technological solution is necessary as it helps share updates in real-\ntime, it makes it easy to follow up on teams to make sure that work is being\ncompleted on time.\n\n![](https://www.oracleglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0-1024x576.jpeg)\n\n##\n\n## Benefits of HR Data Analytics\n\nHR Data and Analytics helps an organization in becoming more strategic by\nhelping them tackle current issues.\n\n  * Improve the hiring process:\n\nHiring people to work for an organization is a key element of the HR process\nregardless of whether they are hiring for a new role, a larger team or a new\nposition in the company. It is a task that requires a lot of work and\npatience. As it takes time to find the right candidate but with the help of HR\nanalytics, it makes the task of finding and retaining a candidate easier.\n\n  * Making your workforce productive:\n\nDue to various factors, workforce productivity is always changing and never\nconstant. Gathering information as to what is affecting productivity and then\nmake changes by implementing employee engagement strategies\n\n  * Gaining the trust of Employees\n\nBecause of HR data and analytics, HR managers have access to all data that\nallows one to see what exactly is happening at the organization and how you\u2019re\nemployees perceive it.\n\n## How Does HR Analytics Help With The HR Onboarding Checklist\n\nFirstly, an [HR onboarding\nchecklist](https://www.goco.io/blog/articles/ultimate-onboarding-checklist-\nfor-hr-managers/) helps the HR and managers ensure that all the necessary\nsteps are being followed to prepare the new candidates for their onboarding\nand guide them through the process of becoming a part of a successful\norganization.\n\nHR analytics as we know deals with people analysis and also are responsible\nfor applying the analytical process to the working capital in order to improve\nthe performance of the employees in the organization and improving employee\nretention.\n\nHR analytics data helps the HR in assessing a candidate\u2019s performance and\ndecisions while hiring new employees, it also helps the HR to guide the new\ncandidates through the onboarding process without any hassles.\n\nHere are a few Steps in the Onboarding Checklist:\n\n  * Submitting a job requisition form with the HR department\n  * Doing a thorough background check of the candidate\n  * Review of schedules and job basics\n  * Filling out all the required new hire forms\n  * Introduction of the new candidates to the team\n  * Preparing candidates for the work environment\n  * Being prepared with new hire training equipment.\n\n[![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7691a339c87fccd69cd9eff95820eb2?s=96&d=identicon&r=g)](https://www.oracleglobe.com/author/dhonalavarungmail-\ncom/)\n\n[Josh Linus](https://www.oracleglobe.com/author/dhonalavarungmail-com/)\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n[![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://www.oracleglobe.com/difference-\nbetween-invoice-financing-and-factoring-and-its-benefits/ \"Difference Between\nInvoice Financing and Factoring and Its Benefits\")\n\n### [Difference Between Invoice Financing and Factoring and Its\nBenefits](https://www.oracleglobe.com/difference-between-invoice-financing-\nand-factoring-and-its-benefits/ \"Difference Between Invoice Financing and\nFactoring and Its Benefits\")\n\n[![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://www.oracleglobe.com/understanding-\nthe-concept-of-digital-marketing-and-how-it-works/ \"Understanding The Concept\nOf Digital Marketing And How It Works\")\n\n### [Understanding The Concept Of Digital Marketing And How It\nWorks](https://www.oracleglobe.com/understanding-the-concept-of-digital-\nmarketing-and-how-it-works/ \"Understanding The Concept Of Digital Marketing\nAnd How It Works\")\n\n[![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://www.oracleglobe.com/how-\nto-maximize-your-solar-tax-credits-in-new-mexico/ \"How to Maximize Your Solar\nTax Credits in New Mexico?\")\n\n### [How to Maximize Your Solar Tax Credits in New\nMexico?](https://www.oracleglobe.com/how-to-maximize-your-solar-tax-credits-\nin-new-mexico/ \"How to Maximize Your Solar Tax Credits in New Mexico?\")\n\n____\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/how-hr-analytics-and-hr-data-benefit-a-\nbusiness/#respond)\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\n\nPlease enter your email address here\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n[![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUQAAACgAQMAAABOhoelAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAAB1JREFUWMPtwTEBAAAAwiD7p/ZdCGAAAAAAAAAQBxpAAAH8le3bAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://www.oracleglobe.com/is-\nalpha-dog-a-real-story-jesse-james-hollywood-murder-of-nicholas-markowitz/ \"Is\nAlpha Dog a Real Story ?Jesse James Hollywood / Murder of Nicholas Markowitz\")\n\n### [Is Alpha Dog a Real Story ?Jesse James Hollywood /\nMurder...](https://www.oracleglobe.com/is-alpha-dog-a-real-story-jesse-james-\nhollywood-murder-of-nicholas-markowitz/ \"Is Alpha Dog a Real Story ?Jesse\nJames Hollywood / Murder of Nicholas Markowitz\")\n\n[Josh Linus](https://www.oracleglobe.com/author/dhonalavarungmail-com/) -\nApril 7, 2020\n\n[0](https://www.oracleglobe.com/is-alpha-dog-a-real-story-jesse-james-\nhollywood-murder-of-nicholas-markowitz/#respond)\n\n\u2018Alpha Dog\u2019 (2006), written and directed by Nick Cassavetes, is a movie about\nfriendships, drugs, and murder.

Like everyone else, many of the challenges are\nexternal, such as regulatory and compliance-related, cost of care and\naccessibility.\n\nBut we also recognise there are internal challenges that we need to focus on,\nincluding educating our team members on the breadth of rewards available, how\nto utilise tools and resources, and continually enhancing team member\nexperience to improve their perception of the overall total rewards programme.\n\n### Q What are some of your key considerations when conceptualising the\nbenefits strategy at Dell?\n\nThere are multiple considerations we\u2019re putting our energy into at this time.\nFrom an operations perspective, improving purchasing power and scale, creating\nrobust financial planning and governance, and developing strong data security\nand analytics are strong focuses.\n\nAlso developing a key strategy around market benchmarking in aggregate and\ntrends. From a people standpoint, conceptualising a benefits strategy to\nenhance our team member experience in part by driving global wellness\ncapabilities and focusing on our digital transformation.\n\n### Q In your view, what are some of the skills rewards professionals need to\nkeep up with trends?\n\nThere are multiple roles that a person must play in our Center of Excellence,\nwhich can be classified as influencer, analyser, adapter, partner, owner and\narchitect. The skills we look for in a total rewards professional would be\nthat they are data-driven, analytical, hyper-attentive to detail, and have\nstrong communication abilities at all levels.\n\n### Q How would organisations benefit from a robust total rewards strategy?\n\nA robust total rewards strategy is the foundation for an organisation to\nattract, motivate and retain the talent appropriate for their needs. In our\ncase, this is an essential part of our overall business strategy. It is also\nour intent that it should help generate a high employee net promoter score\n(eNPS) and make the organisation an employer of choice.\n\n### Q What are you most excited about sharing at [#TotalRewardsAsia\n2020](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/event-info/total-rewards-asia-\nsummit-2020/)?\n\nI look forward to talking about Dell\u2019s cutting-edge digital transformation\nstory, areas where we lead the market in total rewards, and about our big\npicture thinking.\n\n* * *\n\nFind out more at the [conference\nhomepage](https://conferences.humanresourcesonline.net/total-rewards-asia-sg/)\nand secure your seat early at Total Rewards Asia Singapore.\n\n[I want to sponsor:](https://conferences.humanresourcesonline.net/ehi-\nsg-2019/sponsorship-kits/) Engage in meaningful dialogue through dedicated\nspeaking slots, and at your booths!

By analyzing the scaled data, HR can better\nsupport business decisions. With these facts, they can move from the bottom\nline and change their relationship with the senior management team. This way,\nHR could have a stronger position on the board of a company. They could\nmeasure their own and the employees\u2019 performance, and with time they can\ncompare it to different timelines.\n\nWe can approach the importance of HR analytics from two sides. On the one\nhand, without measurable results, HR is not able to prevail at the business\nlevel. To represent its interests, HR should be able to conjugate statistics\nwith its achievements. On the other hand, HR analytics is also known as people\nanalytics. It revolves around analyzing people's problems using data to answer\ncritical questions about an organization.\n\nThe [Games for Business](https://gamesforbusiness.com/) team has gathered some\nareas that HR should keep an eye on in their daily lives.\n\n####  **1\\. Employee satisfaction**\n\nPeople are the key elements of running a successful business, and HR is the\nconnection between the company and its employees.\n\nWith the recruitment process, an employee\u2019s corporate journey has just begun.\n\nAfter this critical phase, the next crucial point is onboarding, which will\nfundamentally define the employee's integration into the workplace.\n\nIt is essential to get regular feedback about our employee\u2019s wellbeing. With a\nquestionnaire, we can qualitatively measure employee satisfaction. Still, at\nthe end of the day, we shouldn't forget that human relationships need quality\ntime and good conversations in the company during a coffee break, for example.\nDissatisfaction is a major cause of employee turnover. It is vital to act on\ntime and reduce fluctuation.\n\n####  **2\\. Employee engagement**\n\nA strong level of employee engagement predicts higher productivity, better\ncustomer service, lower turnover, and many other relevant and positive\noutcomes.\n\nOur projects at Games for Business have proven that learning participation\nrates are directly related to employee engagement. At CIB Bank, employees\nvoluntarily spent 3 and 1/3 hours on average with learning about\ndigitalization processes and tools in the system. During Coca-Cola\u2019s corporate\nstrategy training campaign, employee engagement was not only strong during\nbusiness hours, but 51% of all user activity was recorded outside of working\nhours. Looking at learning participation rates, we will see the percentage of\nemployees who take part in professional courses and training sessions. Beyond\nthat, we can measure engagement with index numbers like average learning time\n(usage time of the learning system / the number of users), or average\ncompletion rate (the number of users who successfully complete the task / the\ntotal number who attempted it). If we look beyond internal learning, PwC, for\nexample, has implemented our system for an employer branding campaign, after\nwhich 77% of users changed their opinion about the company in positive ways.\n\n####  **3\\. Time to Productivity**\n\nEmployee productivity is closely related to employee satisfaction and employee\nengagement. Happy employees are more productive. In most cases, the working\nhours of a company are predefined. Companies are increasingly letting this\ntraditional mentality go. Nowadays, it doesn't matter how many hours you work\nfor a day. What matters is what you have achieved.\n\nBesides the productivity rate, it is even more important to track \u2018time to\nproductivity.\u2019 This is the average period needed for newly hired employees to\nreach the targeted level of work efficiency.\n\nThis metric tells a lot about your company's onboarding process. If you use\nour learning platform as an onboarding system, it is easy to measure time to\nproductivity. Users receive clear goals and activities they are expected to\naccomplish during a determined period. We can compare individual results with\nthe average time needed to complete the onboarding process.\n\n####  **4\\. Training effectiveness**\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of training, you need to measure what people have\nlearned. This can be tricky if you are only running traditional classroom\ntraining. In contrast, using a digital learning platform makes it much easier\nto retrieve data and communicate it to the management team.\n\nBefore the training, it is also crucial to have a placement test to assess the\naverage knowledge level in the given topic. After the training, it is also\nessential to deepen and measure the acquired knowledge based on prior\nobjectives.\n\nOne can also measure the participation rate (number of colleagues who\nparticipated in the training / number of colleagues invited to the training),\nhow costs are distributed per employee (training costs / number of training\nparticipants) or compare user results (comparing individual performance with\nthe average performance of employees).\n\n####  **5\\. 90-day quit rate**\n\nThis KPI is a turnover metric that shows the number of hires who leave the\ncompany within their first three months. It is often a critical period for\nmany companies.\n\nTypically, it is HR's job to recruit the right people and support their work\nwith a proper onboarding process. Failing to do so will have a measurable\nnegative impact on organizational effectiveness.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why Generali decided to implement our gamified\ndigital learning platform for their induction process. Since the application\nof the tool, Generali has seen an outstanding improvement in its people\u2019s\ndevelopment as well as in the sales revenue. This KPI is particularly relevant\nwhen it is combined with other features. You can see turnover rates for\nspecific worker groups such as underperformers, salespeople, millennials or\nmid-level managers, etc. Take your time to view the data from different\nangles. The most common way to calculate the 90-day quit rate is if you divide\nthe number of employees who leave the company during their first three months\nwith the number of employees who entered in the same period.\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

That\u2019s\nwhy business units were created. Departments like Procurement, Marketing,\nLegal, Finance, and R&D allow businesses to build specialised teams that are\nexperts at performing specific functions \u2013 and should thus be able to together\nsolve said problem.  \n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/work.jpg)\n\nYet we all know too well that silos create disconnects and make it hard to\naccess the whole. Dealing with the outcome of a siloed organisation and\ninsufficient data is an issue that has exponentially increased during the\nonset of the current global COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\nA business and its units at heart are all about the people who work in them,\nand a well-functioning HR department can improve performance by providing both\nindividual support and building a high-level picture of the needs,\ncapabilities, and structure of your company\u2019s workforce.  \n\nTo navigate times of uncertainty - and ensure business continuity - HR\ndepartments need to have a solid foundation to build on with structured and\neasily accessible employee master data.  \n\n> _\u201cHR can help by giving a business a view on its most important assets - its\n> people.\u201d _\n\n#### People, pay, and planning\n\nHR data provides crucial information in support of other business unit\nfunctions. When it comes to people joining and leaving your company, HR\ndepartments with solid master data have a factual base for understanding what\na successful employee journey looks like and how to organise this process.\nThey will be able to recruit through digital channels in a smarter way,\nonboard successfully, build succession plans that ensure departments are never\nshort of the personnel they need, and provide valuable guidance when\nrestructuring is required.  \n\nPayroll is a huge expense for most companies, and being on top of the numbers\nis key when it comes to going over costs. There can be little understanding of\nwhether salaries are evenly distributed when different roles, skills,\nexperience, progress, corporate social responsibility, and diversity are taken\ninto account. Pass this information onto finance, and you will make friends.  \n\n> _\u201cBeing on top of the reasons behind the numbers will help you make the\n> right decisions when planning and organising your staff.\u201d_  \n>\n\nThe availability of your staff is crucial data in times of pressure. Absences,\nholidays and remote working schedules are important to track in order to be on\ntop of what is happening. For instance, a high rate of sick leaves could\nindicate demotivated employees and a need to train managers, or it could\nindicate a team with a high number of parents with young children. A solid HR\nmaster data set will help interpret this information correctly.\n\n#### Data-driven employee satisfaction\n\nIn today\u2019s extremely fluid situation, it is even more important than ever\nbefore for HR to build new digital processes to connect with employees, so a\nrapid shift to digital channels is essential to maintain an accurate picture.\nSupporting business operations and business continuity is one obvious benefit\nof digital HR tools and accurate HR master data, but they will also help you\nsupport your people through uncertain times.  \n\n> _\u201cFrom a practical perspective, informed HR decisions and recommendations\n> can only be made if you have a complete picture of your employees and clear\n> strategic goals.\u201d_  \n>\n\nAn HR master data set based on the right KPIs includes data points that give a\nbetter collective understanding of areas that concern the staff as a whole,\nbut also of areas like personal development and individual motivation. It can\nalso enable better forecasting and trend-based predictions. For example, you\ncan track if employee satisfaction actually goes up if HR gives managers the\ntools and training they need to help employees align work with individual\ngoals.  \n\nMaster data should give you insights into the whole palette. If you are strong\non competence mapping but weak on individual goal setting, you could be at\nrisk of demotivating people by guiding them onto a development path that\nsupports company strategy but does not positively engage them on a personal\nlevel.  \n\nIn times where the strategy can change fast and you need to regroup, digital\ntools help you gather the right data to effectively communicate and implement\nchanges and lead your people towards a new direction while simultaneously\ntracking your progress and adjusting accordingly. Organisations with this type\nof resilience are the ones likely to succeed.  \n\nProperly-structured HR master data can also act as a window onto a company\u2019s\nculture. It can be hard to know if business units and different locations have\nadopted company-wide culture points, or if HR initiatives are having the right\nimpact. A standardised, automated process for collecting data can give a\ngranular view of teams and locations, as well as a country and company-wide\nunderstanding of how much progress is really being made.  \n\n_\u201cWith the right HR data and HR KPIs, you will preserve and cherish what makes\nyour organisation unique.\u201d_\n\n#### Tracking HR ROI\n\nInsights such as these help HR professionals track ROI for their initiatives.\nHaving access to HR master data also helps ensure decision making is well-\ninformed and based on accurate data.  \n\nOn the other hand, an automated process designed to collect and handle\nemployee data in compliance with GDPR, privacy, and employment law\nrequirements will deliver savings in time, money, and potential future legal\ncosts. In a situation like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the first questions\nmany companies ask are very basic: how many people work for us? Where can all\nfind their contact information? How many are on sick leave or working from\nhome? How do I handle a potential organisational restructuring?  \n\nFor example, overall efficiency savings of 50-75% have been seen by HR\ndepartments adopting fully digital contract creation processes. Digital HR\ntools will save any organisation a tremendous amount of time \u2013 a resource that\nis sparse when a crisis is at the corner.\n\n#### Finally\n\nThere is no such thing as the perfect Master HR data set, and the rate at\nwhich this data changes is now faster than ever before. My suggestion to you\nis this: build on top of a solid, automated, administrative base; decide what\nto track by defining KPIs that help you keep a current view of your company\u2019s\nmost important asset, its people, measure the impact of your initiatives \u2013 and\nkeep on incrementally learning as you navigate the new normal.  \n\nWritten by Jaakko Mattila, Business Development Manager at Sympa HR.  \n\nJaakko has specialised in HR development and new industry trends and\nhappenings.

It aimed to bridge the\ngap between school-level education and workplace requirements.\n\nDepending on the median educational qualification available in your region,\nand the day-to-day requirements of work, the definition of human resource\ndevelopment can vary widely.\n\nFor example, a plan to amplify people's potential for a startup in Silicon\nValley will look very different from a human resource development program\ndesigned for a large factory in China.\n\nIn the early days, HRD would involve rigorous hands-on training focused on the\nacquisition of hard skills. Today, the picture is different.\n\nThe skills profile of top-tier talent is highly layered, comprising a mix of\nhard and soft skills. HR must pay equal attention to these areas of human\nresource development to bring out an employee's full potential.\n\nIn addition, strategies to improve culture and build a work environment\nconducive to upskilling and self-development also come under HRD. A data-\ndriven mindset might also prove useful, allowing HR to measure learning\nperformance and dynamically update performance benchmarks.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend an agile approach when defining human resource\ndevelopment for your company, keeping in mind your organization's unique needs\nand its potential to grow.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Learning and Development (L &D;)? Definition,\nObjectives, and Best Practices for\nStrategy**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-\nis-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)\n\n## **5 Key Functions of Human Resource Development**\n\nThere are five formal human resource development functions in an HR\ndepartment:\n\n### **1\\. Strategic talent sourcing and acquisition**\n\n  \nThe first step to enhancing your human capital is to spot and onboard the\nright talent. The best candidates may not always have the most experience or\nthe highest number of qualifications. However, they can be good culture adds\nto your organization.\n\nA careful mix of soft skills, personality, and potential will determine\n**[talent sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , and in turn, the effectiveness of\nhuman resource development.\n\nRight from the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) stage, HR begins to equip the\nemployee with the knowledge required to succeed during the employee's tenure\nin the organization.\n\n### **2\\. Education-oriented employee benefits**\n\n  \nA benefits package focused on human resource development will include\nsponsorships for adult education, assistance for tuition fees, flexible hours\nfor those continuing their learning outside of college, and so on.\n\nFor example, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan provides U.S. employees\nwith tuition coverage for specific universities and degrees. DHL offers a\nsimilar benefit in the form of tuition reimbursement for employees applying\nfor online college degrees.\n\n![The functions of human resource development](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The functions of human resource development**\n\n### **3\\. Performance measurement and management**\n\n  \nPerformance management is at the heart of human resource development.\nEmployees may not always be able to take time out for learning sessions and\nonline courses, which is where a strength-focused [**performance management**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-\nperformance-management/)model kicks in.\n\nManagers regularly review employee performance and share inspiring/coaching\nfeedback. Employees then focus on improving performance, incrementally\nimproving their capabilities. Such a structure requires agility to prove\nuseful.\n\n### **4\\. Formal learning and development programs**\n\n  \nTo complement managers' efforts, you can offer learning and development\nsessions to close specific skills gaps. This must factor in company needs on\nthe one hand and the employee's personal ambitions on the other.\n\nLet's say an employee with leadership potential is interested in the marketing\ndomain. You can assign a learning track that develops both these skill sets\nand gradually helps the employee transition into the marketing department\nwhere they can learn the ropes before taking on that leadership role.\n\n### **5\\. Internal mobility and succession planning**\n\n  \nAn effective human resource development program will ensure that every\nemployee finds the best-fit job within the organization, in sync with their\ndesires and capabilities.\n\nInternal mobility supports lateral transitions, while a succession plan\nfocuses on developing future leaders. Once again, internal mobility and\nsuccession planning must be supported by hard and soft skills training,\nrespectively.\n\nInterestingly, HRD also takes place informally. Unstructured interactions such\nas informal mentorships and on-the-job collaboration can go a long way in\nstrengthening employee capabilities. However, having a structured, measurable\nprogram in place is essential to the success of a human resource development\nprogram.\n\n## **How to Start a Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe many functions of human resource development require several stakeholders\nfrom outside the HR department. That's why launching the program could seem\nlike an effort- and time-intensive task.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of steps that could streamline the process:\n\n### **1\\. Assess internal and external talent potential**\n\n  \nTake stock of your existing workforce and the available talent pool in your\ndomain and region. Estimate hiring timelines for expanding the workforce and\nlaunching the program. To do this, you can use **[HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-hr-\nanalytics/)**. Based on the data the analytics engine has, it can identify the\npotential of each employee and help you develop training programs accordingly.\n\n### **2\\. Map human resource training and development objectives**\n\n  \nMake sure to include both near- and long-term objectives in this step. These\nobjectives could range from upskilling for a project that must be closed in\none month to making your workforce more resilient to ongoing digital\ntransformation. Collaborate with the different stakeholders needed to create\nthis employee career development program \u2013 for instance, department heads and\nteam leaders.\n\n### **3\\. Identify the resources need for training and development**\n\n  \nWhat are the tools, resources, time, and external assistance you need to meet\nthe objectives mapped out in the previous step? Carefully outline these\nprocesses to build a sequential strategy that clearly defines the expected\noutcomes.\n\n### **4\\. Speak to stakeholders and obtain buy-in**\n\n  \nThis could include buy-in from the CEO for high-level business targets, from\nthe CIO for digital tools and implementation, from the CFO for budget\napproval, the CHRO to hire external consultants if required, and the like.\n\n### **5\\. Communicate with on-ground execution managers**\n\n  \nThe program will be primarily executed by team leaders, business unit heads,\nand learning practitioners. Conduct workshops with these individuals\nbeforehand to convey the intended objectives of learning and the approach that\nwill be adopted. Ensure that you adapt the plan based on feedback.\n\n### **6\\. Launch the program and review it at regular intervals** :\n\n  \nAfter a specific interval (a robust HRD program will take time to show\ntangible results), conduct an evaluation.\n\n  * What are the program's strengths and weaknesses?\n  * Is the cost-to-benefit ratio in your favor?\n  * Should the plan have a wider deployment?\n\n  \nReview these parameters and relaunch the program after accommodating this\nfeedback.\n\nThese are some of the foundational steps to start a human resource development\nprogram, no matter what your intended vision might be. Let's now look at a set\nof best practices that can help HR across industries to develop their human\ncapital better.\n\n## **8** **Best Practices for Human Resource Training and Development**\n\nThere are several ways to make sure that your human resource training and\ndevelopment strategy hits the mark.\n\nWe specifically mention the training here because on-the-job training is\npivotal to developing employee capabilities in nearly every field. Whether you\nrun a manufacturing plant or supervise an educational institution, whether\nyour company makes softballs or software platforms, the workforce must be\nadequately trained to produce the expected output.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these best practices:\n\n### **1\\. Assign human resource development owners**\n\n  \nThe best strategies can fall flat if there is no ownership for execution.\nThat's why companies must set specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for\ntraining, development, and performance, with process owners who are tasked\nwith improving these metrics. These individuals may be L&D; practitioners in\nthe organization, team leaders, line managers, and the like.\n\n### **2\\. Contain attrition among trained workers by focusing on engagement**\n\n  \nHuman resource training and development involves significant investment per\nemployee, which becomes redundant when a highly trained resource leaves the\norganization. This is where focusing on ancillary HR functions such as\n**[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** , recognition, and culture-building\ncan help prevent **[employee\nattrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n### **3\\. Use rewards and recognition to incentivize learning**\n\n  \nRecognition is closely linked with **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and therefore helps to\ncontain attrition in your workforce. Rewards for course completion and\nsuperior performance can also motivate employees further.\n\n### **4\\. Coordinate pan-organizational development**\n\n  \nTraining and development tracks in different departments/business units should\nnot be planned independently of each other. A centralized approach that keeps\nin mind the progress each department is making can enable the HRD program to\nmeet the company's shared vision and purpose.\n\n### **5\\. Link career progression to development**\n\n  \nCareer progression shouldn't entirely depend on the length of an employee's\ntenure. After training and development sessions, if an employee is seen to be\nan exceptional performer, you can develop a personalized career progression\ntrack for them.\n\n### **6\\. Initiate human resource training and development from day 1**\n\n  \nYou can work together with the recruitment team to embed training into the\n**[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**. This will give\nnew employees an understanding of your continuous learning culture, making\nlater-stage training much easier.\n\n### **7\\. Avoid a cookie-cutter training and development journey**\n\n  \nOne of the most significant transformations in human resource development is\nthe emerging need for personalization. Today, employees are aware of their\nunique capabilities, which demand personalized and adaptive learning\nmethodologies. Here's where corporate eLearning software can help.\n\n### **8\\. Make the development transferable**\n\n  \nA formal human resource development program should offer certifications,\nmicro-credentials, and even digital badges upon completion. These achievements\nare transferable to other jobs outside the organization and can encourage\nemployees to fast-track the learning process.\n\nThese are some of the best practices that can strengthen your human resource\ndevelopment strategy and make your training initiatives genuinely stick.\n\n## **4 Software Tools to Support Your Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe HR technology landscape is continuously growing, including learning and\ndevelopment tech. Several of these tools can prove useful to develop a\ncompany's employee potential. So, consider the following platforms when\noutlining your HRD strategy for 2020:\n\n### **1\\. A job shadow enablement software like Grandshake**\n\n  \nNearly 70% of all learning happens via on-the-job experiences. That's why job\nshadowing and apprenticeship have traditionally been integral to human\nresource development.\n\nNow, platforms like Grandshake are taking it one step further.\n\nYou can connect with local schools and educational organizations, you can\nengage with the \"shadowee\" and screen applications through video resumes, and\nyou can improve performance through the in-platform feedback loop.\n\n### **2\\. A workforce analytics platform like** **Cognisess**\n\n  \nWorkforce analytics can reveal valuable insights into your human resource\npotential, future possibilities, and next-best actions to boost performance.\nAnalytics is now critical for human resource development programs, which is\nwhy solutions like Cognisess have rapidly gained traction.\n\nCognisess Pro is a predictive people analytics platform that has 50+\nassessments to measure 120+ performance attributes. It uses AI to bypass the\nrisk of bias/subjectivity, maximizing the value of your people assets.\n\n### **3\\. A career pathing and internal mobility tool like** **Paddle**\n\n  \nIn a large workforce, hidden employee potential can go unnoticed. Your human\nresource development program should be able to tap into such capabilities to\noptimize resource utilization in your company. A tool like Paddle can match\nemployees with the right role, improving overall productivity.\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered tool for career pathing and internal mobility\nstreamlining. It has a repository of learning materials to support\ntransitions. The tool's AI can analyze employee skill sets and career\nhistories to recommend the most suitable career path.\n\n### **4\\. A multi-device e-learning authoring solution like** **Gomo**\n\n  \nYour e-learning platform must combine multi-device delivery for convenient,\npersonalized learning experiences with advanced analytics on employee\nprogress. Gomo has two modules: Authoring for e-learning content generation\nand Delivery & Analytics to track consumption on multiple devices.\n\nGomo is a no-installation SaaS product that's easy to use, reducing the time-\nto-value from your human resource development program. It is used by the likes\nof Vodafone, Sony, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n## **Looking Forward: Which Areas of Human Resource Development Demand\nAttention in 2020?**\n\nThe definition of human resource development concept covers a broad spectrum.\n\nWith so many areas and functions to address, it can be challenging to\nprioritize those that demand the most attention. Fortunately, predictive\nanalytics tools can highlight which organization-specific areas of human\nresource development should rank the highest on your checklist for every\nquarter/year.\n\nApart from this, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the latest HR trends and\nmap your HRD program to global benchmarks to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nFor 2020, we recommend a keen focus on the following areas:\n\n  * **Shedding legacy practices:** Three out of five HR leaders fear irrelevance in 2020 if the HR function doesn't embrace modernization, as per KPMG's [survey](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-future-of-human-resources-2020.html) of 1,300 HR leaders.\n  * **Establishing a culture framework:** 61% of respondents in the survey we cited are in the process of changing their culture. In 2020, HR professionals will need an established framework to align culture to continuous training and development.\n  * **Preparing for artificial intelligence (AI):** Targeted human resource training and development to mitigate the challenges brought on by AI is vital in 2020. 56% of respondents in the KPMG survey agree on this issue.\n\n  \nRemember, a human resource development program isn't set in stone. In essence,\nfeedback from execution managers, realigning the program based on performance\nand learning analytics, and finally, incorporating global trends in HR will be\nthe way forward in the execution of a successful HRD program.\n\nAre you ready to design a human resource development strategy that's suited to\nyour company?\n\n_What does your human resource development program for 2020 look like?

Through the digitization of personal information ranging from\nperformance to communication patterns, we can use AI to reveal insights that\ncan supercharge business success. However, our increasingly remote and\nalgorithm managed workforce can also hide under the digital blanket, free from\nhuman oversight, authentic relationships, and management intuition. What is\nthe role of HR in supporting the \u2018people of the cloud\u2019 in this global age of\nautomation?\n\n## **Reinforce a Unique and Engaging Culture**\n\nIt\u2019s been said that culture eats everything else for breakfast. Big brands are\nsuccessful for many reasons, including their culture. With magnetic founders,\nrags to riches story, and a clearly communicated culture, they are able to\nmotivate and guide a distributed, educated, knowledge workforce. Consider how\nto digitize and disseminate a founder\u2019s mindset. When employees can visualize\nan admirable founder and feel like they are part of a Cinderella story, they\ncan better act in the interest of the organization.\n\n## **Communicate a Clear and Compelling Strategy**\n\nIn a virtual organization where people are more digitally connected than\npersonally connected, clarity of purpose is paramount. Especially in this VUCA\nage, where knowledge workers must operate with agility, people need to know\nwhat truly matters. If they don\u2019t know where they are going, how are they\ngoing to get there? The vision, mission, and values of the organization need\nto be readily available and frequently reinforced. Employees at all levels of\nthe organization should have an \u2018elevator pitch\u2019 at hand if asked what your\ncompany does.\n\n## **Collect Useful Data**\n\nThe volume, variety, and velocity of data are only accelerating, hence the\nlove affair with \u2018Big Data.\u2019 However, an additional \u2018v\u2019 to keep in mind is\nintegrity. How accurate and useful is the workforce data? After all, what gets\nmeasured gets managed.\n\nBesides too little data, there may also be an issue of too much data. It\u2019s\nincreasingly popular to plow through massive troves of data in search of the\ngolden insights. However, just because something is easy to see and\nunderstand, doesn\u2019t mean it matters. Genuinely knowing the individual\ndifferences of a workforce in this digital age is more possible than ever, yet\nrarely done well. Good people analytics that drives strategic growth to\nrequire high-quality people data that is both \u2018reliable\u2019 and \u2018valid.\u2019 These\nare terms every HR professional needs to know.\n\n## **Create an Accessible Data Lake**\n\nSiloed data leads to feeble insights. Precise measurements are like fresh\ningredients for a delicious meal, but a kitchen, recipe, and cook are all\nneeded to serve up something memorable. One advantage of the cloud is the\nability to create a common repository for data that is easily accessible by\nanyone with permission from any internet-connected location. However, for all\nthe advances in statistics and data capture, data management is still\nstruggling to keep up. It\u2019s important to think about and manage how data flows\nand is captured within an organization. To what extent is financial data,\npeople data, operational data, and customer data accessible in a standard\nlocation with the potential for a combination? What level of expertise is\nneeded to access this data and visualize it? Automation and a clear cloud-\nbased data strategy that includes all aspects of the business can help, and HR\nneeds to have a voice in this.\n\n## **Promote Authentic Relationships**\n\nHumanity cannot be automated. People have an innate desire to connect with\nother people, to feel valued, and to feel understood. Digitizing a workforce\ncan lead to people becoming ghosts for the company and investing their\nauthentic selves into side endeavors. Creating opportunities for social\ninteraction, serendipitous conversations, and cross-organizational friendships\ncan yield dividends in terms of loyalty and innovation. Community events,\nsocial committees, internal social platforms for sharing and budget allocated\nto face to face training and conferences are all opportunities to inject\nhumanity back into the digital enterprise.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Transform HR Data Into Business\nResults](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\ntransform-hr-data-into-business-result/)**\n\n## **Be Transparent and Trustworthy**\n\nJust as recruiters can scour the web for intimate details of applicants,\napplicants can peruse glassdoor or other sources to learn the truth about an\norganization. The skeletons in the closet are now dancing in the streets, and\nit\u2019s incumbent upon leadership to promote open, honest two-way communication.\nAs the locker room cultures of wunderkind companies lead to headlines and\nchanges, and as the push for Inclusiveness and Diversity accelerates, HR must\nensure leadership understands the importance of matching words to actions. If\nleaders expect loyalty and honest work, they should show trustworthiness and\nhonesty in their dealings. One role of HR is to advocate for this mindset, not\nout of compassion but out of necessity. In any area of the organization, HR\nshould most understand the pitfalls of eroding trust within the workforce.\n\n## **Provide Automated Coaches and Micro-learnings**\n\nThe days of an apprentice shadowing their master may be fading, but coaching\nand training are as important as ever. Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired\nmagazine, points out in his insightful book The Inevitable, that we are\nentering an age of constant learning. The cloud mentality is one of the\ncontinuous upgrades and steady change. Employees can no longer be expected to\nknow all they need to know, but they can be expected to know how to learn\nquickly. The job of HR and the organization is to make that learning readily\navailable and immediately consumable.\n\n## **Give Internal Stretch Opportunities**\n\nIn our age of ultimate flexibility, the gig economy thrives. It is\nincreasingly common for employees to have \u2018side hustles\u2019 as they seek to\nmaximize earnings, grow, and give back to the community. HR can help provide\nworkers with stretch opportunities, optional side projects, and ways to give\nback internally. If employees are motivated to go \u2018above and beyond,\u2019 then\nit\u2019s essential that organizations channel that enthusiasm. Create internal job\nboards, optional committees, and volunteer projects for people. Track the\nactivity, recognize the efforts, and consider the full range of performance\nwhen evaluating people.\n\n**Learn More:[HR Data Management in a Non-Employee World: 4 Things to\nKnow](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/hr-data-management-\nin-a-nonemployee-world-4-things-to-know/)**\n\n## **Infuse Personality Throughout the Automation**\n\nWarren Bennis said, \u2018the factory of the future will have only two employees, a\nman, and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there\nto keep the man from touching the equipment.\u2019 Automation is inevitable, but it\nneedn\u2019t be dull. HR should consider how to infuse the culture, personality,\nand brand of the organization into all human facing automation.\n\n## **Understand and Respect Privacy**\n\nFinally, although there is an excellent promise in the 21st-century cloud-\nbased organization, there are also privacy concerns that are only growing.\nWhether it\u2019s the new California privacy laws, the European GDPR, or the\nCanadian Privacy Act, HR professionals need to continue to stay abreast of\nemployee regulations and ensure compliance. However, beyond compliance,\norganizations should consider the \u2018psychological contracts\u2019 of employees. This\nis the unwritten contract that describes the understandings, beliefs, and\ncommitments that exist between an employee and employer. Understanding what\nthe employee expects and communicating in a way to maintain that mutual\nunderstanding will go a long way towards minimizing litigation and maximizing\nmotivation.\n\n_Do you know the role of HR in supporting the people of the cloud?

_Publicly listed multinational firm selects cloud call center solution to\nsupport launch of new Employee Shared Services department_\n\n[3CLogic](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3clogic.com%2F&esheet=52199493&newsitemid=20200407005056&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=3CLogic&index=1&md5=de02d5f63506a1e17ad1f54e184a05cd), a leading\nprovider of cloud contact center solutions, today announced the selection of\nits Total Cloud offering by a publicly listed global materials manufacturer\nwith over 250 locations worldwide. The AWS-hosted cloud solution and\nServiceNow\u00ae were jointly selected as part of a new Employee Shared Services\ninitiative designed to streamline and improve overall services to its global\nworkforce.\n\nDesigned to complement ServiceNow\u2019s existing digital channels (i.e.: self-\nservice portal, email, chat), the solution offers a deep CTI and [call center\nintegration with ServiceNow\u2019s\u00ae HR Service\nDelivery](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3clogic.com%2Fservicenow%2F&esheet=52199493&newsitemid=20200407005056&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=call+center+integration+with+ServiceNow%26%238217%3Bs%26%23174%3B+HR+Service+Delivery&index=2&md5=c7ac6d7c0f28ec769276cfaa032c1ccb)\nplatform to improve agent efficiency through the automated distribution of\nemployee calls or HR inquiries.\n\nThe 3CLogic solution with ServiceNow\u2019s Employee Workflows platform will\ninclude:\n\n  *  **Telephony integration and agent presence synchronization with ServiceNow\u2019s digital channels** to allow HR staff to manage all employee engagements from a single user interface.\n  *  **Natively integrated IVR Call Flow Designer** to enable supervisors to easily create and manage the employee journey with ServiceNow-based dynamic call routing to the most qualified agent.\n  *  **Automatic HR case creation** for employee-submitted voicemails to improve awareness and reduce agent response time.\n  *  **Integrated reporting and call analytics with ServiceNow** to track agent assignments across channels and derive consolidated insights.\n\nWhile digital channels are well suited to handle or automate simple inquiries,\nemployees continue to rely on a personalized, one-on-one agent experience over\nthe phone to handle more complex, sensitive, or urgent inquiries. In fact,\nrecent research1 revealed 74% of globally surveyed individuals called a\ncontact center in 2019 for assistance.\n\n\"The HR Department handles a wide variety of employee inquiries, from\nsensitive information to recruitment and professional development\nopportunities. The nature of these calls tends to be time sensitive, so it is\ncritical for the telephony platform to direct the caller to the right agent,\"\nsays Denis Seynhaeve, 3CLogic\u2019s CEO. \"With the natively-integrated IVR\ndesigner for ServiceNow, employee details are collected upfront and callers\nare automatically routed to the most qualified agent, ensuring more time is\nspent handling the inquiry and less spent waiting in line.\"\n\nThe manufacturing firm also plans to extend the ServiceNow certified cloud\ncall center capabilities to its IT and customer service teams leveraging\nServiceNow\u2019s ITSM and CSM suites, with the potential to expand into over 20\ncountries.\n\n **About 3CLogic**\n\n3CLogic is a leading cloud contact center platform modernizing enterprise\ncommunications with their employees and customers. Built on Amazon Web\nServices (AWS), the solution provides advanced and scalable speech-enabled\nofferings for leading CRMs, including ServiceNow, Salesforce, and SugarCRM.\nWith deployments on four continents and a growing base of Global 2000 clients,\n3CLogic drives digital transformation by improving CX, organizational\nefficiency and reporting insights using dynamic IVR, CTI, AI, advanced speech\nanalytics, and API-driven integrations.

HR technology, buyers remain unsatisfied with\noutcomes.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 9, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JonathanSears-250x375.jpg)\n\nJonathan Sears\n\nSears says traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

These new-age HRTech tools are now helping enterprises hire, train,\nengage and retain employees better, with a strong focus on increasing\n\u201cemployee experience\u201d and \u201corganizational productivity\u201d.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR News:**[VCV Launches AI-Powered Platform to Simplify the Hiring\nProcess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/vcv-\nlaunches-aipowered-platform-to-simplify-hiring-process/)\n\nSingapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in HRTech adoption, but the\nscenario has been fast-changing over the last two years. This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm. Incidentally, Both Adrian Tan and hr tech.sg had worked\ntogether on the [2019 Market Map](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-marketplace/) also, which was widely acclaimed for his\ncomprehensive coverage of the categories and players.\n\nA step further, the 2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map has seen the addition of\nnewer HR categories and subcategories to help HR Professionals and Enterprises\nchoose the vendors in line with their specific needs.\n\nThe 2020 market map has been categorized the service providers across EIGHT\nmajor Talent segments: Talent Acquisition (Applicant Tracking System;\nSourcing\u00beJob Boards, Referrals, Tech Hiring, Non-PMET; Screening\u00beAssessments,\nVideo Interviews, Background Check), Talent Engagement (Employee\nCommunication; Onboarding; Performance Management), Talent Development\n(Coaching & Mentoring; Competency Management), Talent Operations **** (HR\nAutomation & Bots; Payroll), Talent Rewards (Benefits, Wellness, Compensation\nManagement), Talent Analytics, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS\nEnterprise and SMB\u2019s) and Talent Planning.\n\n\u201cThe need of the hour for HR functions is to aggressively adopt HRTech. This\nwill not only help the HR teams to solve pressing business challenges and use\nbudgets more efficiently, but it also improves candidate and employee\nexperience too.

companies\n\nOrganizations that embrace empathy and put people first will harvest committed\nemployees, greater productivity, and stronger inclusivity.\n\n![Building people-first companies](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586097240/1586097238.jpg)\n\nIf ever a year demanded acute vision, it\u2019s this one - 2020. The world of work\nhas changed in the last couple of weeks, and companies are navigating new\nchallenges. Nearly everyone, it seems, is embracing \u2014 or at least testing \u2014\nthe future of work.\n\nAs per LinkedIn\u2019s latest report, Global Talent Trends 2020, four trends stand\nout which will reshape the talent hiring and recruitment landscape - the\nemergence of employee experience, the spread of people analytics, the return\nof internal recruiting, and the ascent of the multigenerational workforce.\n\nHowever, these trends are all defined in some measure by their demand for\nempathy \u2014 the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Today,\nmore businesses are grinding gears to understand their talent more deeply than\never before, in order to serve them better. This new focus on empathy is\nencouraging companies to put themselves in their employees\u2019 shoes.\n\n_**Employee experience could be the new HR**_\n\nCompanies are beginning to work for employees, and not just the other way\naround. Today, employee experience (EX) goes beyond what we earlier understood\nto be \u2018employee engagement\u2019. What does it exactly mean? The central idea is to\nactively collaborate with employees to understand their point of view and\ndesign experiences that allow people to do their best work.\n\nAs companies become more employee-centric, they\u2019re creating more \u201cemployee\nexperience\u201d roles. Mature organizations are hiring dedicated EX personnel,\nwhile smaller companies are bypassing \u201cHuman Resources\u201d altogether and\nbranding their people function \u201cEmployee Experience\u201d right out of the gate. In\nfact, the number of LinkedIn members whose current job titles include the\nphrase \u201cemployee experience\u201d has seen a 2.4X increase since 2014. In India,\n95% talent professionals believe that EX will be very important in shaping the\nfuture of HR and recruiting, with 77% of them focused on EX to improve\nretention.\n\n_**Using data to build people-first companies**_\n\nWhile employee experience is quickly becoming the cornerstone of hiring and\nretaining talent, meaningful insights will inform talent decisions at every\nlevel of the recruiting cycle. Therefore, understanding and capitalizing on\npeople analytics is quickly becoming a must-have skill in HR. People analytics\nessentially connects data to effective decision-making. It draws insights from\nhuman behavior to help people and companies perform better. It uses formal\nscientific methods to support empathy. In India, 92% of talent professionals,\nthe highest across the world, believe people analytics will be the future of\nHR.\n\nTalent leaders have understood the value of people analytics for some time, as\nit has promised to revolutionize recruiting and HR for a decade. But until\nrecently, only the most sophisticated companies have reaped the benefits. Now\nwe\u2019re reaching an inflection point where data is accessible to all.\nUnderstanding and capitalizing on analytics is quickly becoming a must-have\nskill in HR.\n\nIn fact, over the past five years, LinkedIn has witnessed a 242% increase in\nHR professionals with data analysis skills. Still, many companies are only at\nthe early stages of developing people analytics functions.\n\nWhether organizations use data to derive workforce insights, chart down career\npaths for employees, improve their day-to-day workplace experience, or\nharmonize different generations - they must remain cognizant of the fact that\ntheir businesses are being run by people. Their existence in, and contribution\nto, every level of the process is the driving force that steers businesses\ntowards success. To fully appreciate the impact people analytics can have,\nit\u2019s helpful to see where companies intend to go. Top growth areas include\nanalyzing competitive intelligence, flight risks, and candidate success.\n\nFor instance, professional services firm Genpact was looking at building a\nteam of high-potential engineers with expertise in building and scaling\nsoftware platforms. To hire such talent, the talent acquisition teams had to\ngo back to the drawing board. Using LinkedIn\u2019s data and insights, the talent\nacquisition teams gave the leadership and hiring managers a clear picture of\ntalent availability in the market, which included specific companies to target\nand compensation benchmarks. Empowered with the right data and insights,\nGenpact targeted 200 specific candidates through personalised talent marketing\ncampaigns. In less than 4 weeks, the team was able to shortlist over 21 senior\ntech professionals, and hire them through a customized interview process and\nget them on board, faster.\n\n_**Closing the gaps in understanding talent**_\n\nWhile the focus on EX is skyrocketing, only 52% of talent professionals say\ntheir company provides a positive employee experience. This means that\norganizations still have a lot of work to do. One reason why employee\nexperience suffers may be that while companies are listening to workers,\nthey\u2019re not always taking action. Our global data says that employees who\ndon\u2019t believe their company will act on their feedback are 7x more likely to\nbe disengaged than those who do, according to data from Glint. Clearly,\ninnovative approaches are called for -- new tools are emerging to help\norganizations close the gap between feedback and action. The right technology\ncan help leaders build habits around regular conversations with their teams\nand encourage action at every level of the organization.\n\nWhen it comes to people analytics, there\u2019s a steep learning curve from\ncollecting data to capitalizing on the insights to build a competitive\nadvantage. Almost half of companies feel good about maintaining clean,\naccurate data. But only 39% feel good drawing meaningful insights from their\ndata. There\u2019s a similar drop-off in the transition from \u201cacting\u201d (i.e.,\nsolving existing problems with insights) to \u201ccapitalizing\u201d (taking advantage\nof new opportunities with insights). For example, many might be comfortable\nacting after a spike in attrition, but fewer would be able to proactively hire\nahead of a spike in demand.\n\nWhile some of the areas where companies are currently using analytics include\nemployee performance and workforce planning, one cautionary note is that it is\ncritically important to be careful with people data. Experts recommend\ntreating employees as stakeholders as organizations develop thoughtful and\ntransparent policies.\n\nToday, as we deal with the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus, the most\nimportant topic in HR remains improving employee experience with empathy at\nthe core. Hence, keeping compassion at your foundation can produce better\nbusiness results and build an indispensable workplace culture.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

Essentially, gathering and assessing people analytics\nleads to better decision-making through the application of statistics and\nother data interpretation techniques.\n\nSmarter, more strategic, and data-backed talent decisions are thus closer at\nhand, and this is applicable throughout the employee lifecycle \u2013 from making\nbetter hiring decisions and more effective performance management to better\nretention.\n\nPeople analytics has evolved considerably from when it was first used in\norganizations in the mid-1900s. There has been a clear transition from\nprescriptive analytics to predictive analytics, with which organizations can\nnow be better prepared to face the dynamism of their operational environment\nand be proactive rather than reactive. For example, sophisticated data\nscience, interactive data visualization, and machine learning \u2013 all integral\nparts of people analytics today \u2013 were nowhere a part of the process until a\nfew decades ago.\n\n## **The Process of People Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics today is a lot more intuitive and predictive. With that\nexpectation to live up to, the process involves the following steps.\n\n![The Process of People Analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Step 1: Dig data that matters**\n\n  \nThe core question to ask here is, \u201cWhat data is relevant to our business\ngoals?\u201d\n\nand to set the key performance indicators (KPIs) accordingly. This allows you\nto save major resources by only investigating areas that need direct\nmonitoring, such as operational tasks within the people management spectrum,\nand can lead to tangible business success.\n\nIf it does not add strategic value, digging that data could be a waste of\ntime. Knowing what to focus on also helps in applying the right statistics,\ndata mining, machine learning, survey management, and strategic workforce\nmanagement tools.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **Step 2: Experiment, explore, enrich**\n\n  \nIn a crowded and visibly fragmented market, it is imperative to choose a\npeople analytics tool by exploring the market, experimenting with different\noptions, and analyzing which option would enrich the organization the most.\nMultiple offerings include data mining, data transformation, and data\nvisualization techniques, all merged into a user-friendly self-service\ninterface.\n\nPlatforms that offer a wide range of features often require a lot of manual\nmanipulation to access important data, and these aspects can be tested only\nthrough systematic experimentation.\n\n### **Step 3: Have an action plan ready**\n\n  \nOnce you know what your end goal is, which data is relevant, and what the\navailable options are (based on clear pros vs. cons analysis), create an\naction plan. Applying big data and predictive analytics to **[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)** , leadership development, and organizational capabilities often\nhelps in fine-tuning the action plan.\n\nMoreover, having a well-defined plan of action enables a better understanding\nof why certain changes may be taking place and where the organization is\nheaded and can thus help garner more stakeholder support.\n\n### **Step 4: Avoid legal loopholes**\n\n  \nEnsuring that legal compliance is maintained in the collection of all data is\ncrucial. Before you start on the analytics project, have a legal team validate\nthe data sourcing techniques and processes. It does not end here.\n\nOnce the raw data has been gathered and treated, the results gleaned need to\nbe approved as well before they can be applied or published. In our digital\necosystem, with data protection and privacy laws still evolving, it is prudent\nto keep abreast of the changes and double-check on legal compliance.\n\n### **Step 5: Create leaner systems**\n\n  \nIrrespective of the complexity of the project at hand, the broader strategy\nthat the processes must adhere to needs to be simple and lean. The basic\nprocess of data analysis and interpretation should allow for easy application,\nupdating, and readability.\n\nFor example, create the basic outline simplified as intake and design (data\ncollection and the design of the analysis), data cleaning (removing irrelevant\nor unreliable data), data analysis (quantitative and qualitative exploration),\nand sharing insights (interpretation and presentation of the data). This can\nhelp avoid unnecessary complications such as confusion about the flow of steps\ninvolved, time wastage, or repetition of sub-processes that occur with\nunstandardized process structures, while still allowing room for tweaks where\nnecessary.\n\nThe idea is to find the right balance between the limited moving parts (people\nand the dynamism of the environment) and fluid, customizable systems and\nprocesses of people analytics. When you have the right team with the relevant\nskillset in place, it is easier to streamline the whole process and apply\nquality controls.\n\n### **Step 6: Build a fact-based, measurable HR business strategy**\n\n  \nA realistic HR business strategy avoids functional silos and can align talent\nto business seamlessly. Having clear KPIs and ROI expectations from people\nanalytics endeavors ensures that the impact is measured often and with\ntransparency. A winning strategy needs to be backed by data and an effective\nplan of action.\n\n### **Step 7: Take tech support**\n\n  \nTechnology is interspersed with every aspect of life today and more so with\nprocesses like people analytics, where often a bulk of analytical data is to\nbe treated with little or no room for error. New-age HR tech tools make real-\ntime data easily accessible. And this is an opportunity that needs to be\nmilked because today, agility and real-time intelligence can truly set you\napart from the competition.\n\n## **Four Key People Analytics Trends**\n\nSince people analytics relies heavily on evolving data-mining technologies and\ndata-interpretation strategies, the trends around people analytics develop in\ntime to the same. Here are the top 4 trends that are shaping people analytics\nin itself and how it interacts with the business. Some trends work in a dual\nloop \u2013 they affect people analytics and in turn, all other aspects of HR.\n\n![Four Key People Analytics Trends](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **1\\. Transforming what HR is and does**\n\n  \nBersin research points out that a meager 2% of HR organizations have mature\npeople analytics competence to bank on. There is thus quite a heavy first-\nmover advantage for innovative, intelligent organizations that are trying to\ntap into this space.\n\nWith people analytics changing how recruitment is conducted, how performance\nis measured, how compensation is planned or growth is mapped, and how learning\nand retention can be managed better, people analytics is quickly changing how\nHR operates.\n\nAccording to recent studies by Deloitte, increasing job offer acceptance\nrates, reducing HR help tickets, and optimizing compensation are just a few\nways in which people analytics is quickly becoming the new currency of HR.\nMoreover, with HR processes evolving to keep pace with business needs, people\nanalytics is moving from being a one-time initiative to becoming a real-time,\neasily modifiable tool that HR has immense benefits to draw from.\n\n### **2\\. Transforming HR business interactions**\n\n  \nWith recent trends in the work ecosystem, the interaction between HR and\nbusiness stakeholders (both internal and external) has been undergoing a\ntransformation as well. People analytics needs to change in keeping with the\nlatest trends in leadership. More transparency is a key trend emerging here,\nand intelligent insight is the need of the hour.\n\nBusinesses today need to be able to make sense of seemingly unrelated data\nstreams and find meaning, correlation, and maybe even interdependence between\none or more factors to predict and manage work better. People analytics has\nthe potential to provide actionable recommendations to enable strategic\nplanning and execution processes.\n\n### **3\\. Transforming the HR-employee relationship**\n\n  \nEmployee expectations today are consumer-grade. People analytics is providing\norganizations with the ramp to upgrade the **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)**. Every interaction that a candidate or an employee\nhas with an organization is a data point and could be utilized to glean\ninteresting insights. The idea is the need to transform the relationship that\nthe HR has with employees \u2013 to help HR become and be perceived as more than\njust a support function.\n\n### **4\\. Transforming the quality of insights**\n\n  \nThe quality of insights that are expected on a daily basis has changed over\nthe course of the last couple of years. People analytics can live up to these\nexpectations if you focus on two key aspects: analytics literacy and data\nsecurity.\n\nMore employees will need to become analytics literate to decrease dependence\non technical staff and to allow more perspectives to flourish. As people\nanalytics becomes a staple at organizations, data integrity and data security\nwill need to be upgraded and maintained for all listening channels and pulse\nchecks.\n\nWe discussed legal compliance, but data security should ideally go deeper than\nthat and become a cultural trait within the organization rather than being\nsuperficial check just for the sake of being compliant.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Three Key Level-based Checks to Choose the Right People Analytics Tools**\n\nWith a vast array of available vendors, options, and subscription plans,\nchoosing the right people analytics tools can often seem like a rather\ndaunting task. Here\u2019s a three-level need-based check to make the right\ndecision.\n\n### **Level 1: A working HR dashboard**\n\n  \nTo get started with people analytics, use a basic dashboard that allows you to\ncapture, aggregate, and visualize data.\n\nTools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik allow ease of use and ease of data\naccess. With a level 1 requirement, your priority should be to keep your\npeople analytics system as simple as possible.\n\n### **Level 2: An insightful HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYou may have a steady dose of relevant data and need basic insights to analyze\nbetter and make stronger decisions. Statistical tools like Excel or SPSS are\neffective as well, though they may not come with quirky visual aids and\nsocial-media style interfaces. Tools like Visier, while taking some time to be\nset up, come with holistic analytics solutions.\n\n### **Level 3: A predictive HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYour organization is at the third requirement level when you seek not only to\nanalyze data but also to make intuitive predictions based on upcoming trends.\nThese tools help you study behavior in a way that you can predict the next\ncourse of action.\n\nFor example, there might be some correlation between your employees updating\ntheir LinkedIn page, taking frequent leaves, and with them not being very\ncontent at work. While this is a very simplistic situation, predictive tools\ncould help you make connections with behavior and decision patterns that you\nmight have missed otherwise.\n\nPython or RStudio can help with advanced analyses for large quantities of\ndata, though they might require you to hire data scientists specialized in the\nfield.\n\n## **Update, Upgrade, and Upskill for Smarter People Analytics**\n\nWith the latest people analytics and workforce analytics solutions, you can\ndelve deeper into the behavioral aspects of work, understand the cause-effect\nrelationship between different human and non-human aspects at work, and make\nbetter decisions.\n\nThe three points to remember are to know what data you need to quantify and\nqualify, to understand what the latest trends are, and to know what your end\ngoals are. Enabling your HR to update, upgrade, and upskill their knowledge\nand capabilities will ensure that your organization optimizes the latest\npeople analytics offers and can ride the latest trend waves towards a smarter,\nhappier workforce.\n\n_What people analytics trends do you predict for 2020?

While\nan organization is just starting to function, the primary step of talent\nacquisition is performed by the founder, or the responsibility is shared\nbetween all in the pilot team. [As the organization\ngrows](https://www.influencive.com/7-tips-for-growing-your-business-fast/),\ndemand for more talent and the requirements become complex. Ultimately,\ncompanies have to hire people who are solely responsible for acquiring more\ntalent. This specialized and highly skilled job within the organizations is\nknown as recruiting or staffing, and lately, it is known as Talent\nAcquisition.\n\nWhichever term you use, it is so common now for organizations to have dozens\nof people doing this specialized job of talent acquisition. You may find\nGoogle and Merck as two of the most prominent examples, with about 300+\nrecruiters on board. It is also noted that talent acquisition has become\nanother business inside businesses. With a large volume of activities, inputs,\nand outputs, the process of talent acquisition is complex and difficult to\nmanage and control.\n\nConsidering these complexities, talent acquisition is also a crucial function\nlike production management or supply chain management. Like any other business\nprocess, there are ways to measure the progress and success in talent\nacquisition, too. In other terms, with clear inputs as job applicants and\nstraightforward outputs as hires, the professionals are dealing with a\nstandard throughput funnel, in which a large initial pool of inputs are\nfiltered down to a perfect final result.\n\n##  **Analytics in Talent Acquisition**\n\nTalent acquisition professionals try to find candidates and work on those\nthrough different stages of hiring. There are a lot of activities done, and\neventually, the hire is made. This process needs to be handled correctly. As\n[RemoteDBA suggests](http://www.remotedba.com/consulting-services/), the\nmeasurement for talent acquisition is not just limited to the number of hires\nto come out of the funnel. You may use a wide range of analytics and metrics\nto gain proper control over the hiring activities. The most crucial\nmeasurements in terms of talent acquisition management are:\n\n  * Volume\n  * Efficiency\n  * Speed\n  * Cost\n  * Quality\n  * Experience (of the applicants and recruitment professionals)\n\nHaving proper measurements and tracking will help you to see whether things\nare working well or not, and how to improve efficiency. In many cases, you\nshould have to use proper measurements to make the best possible decision by\nconsidering the given circumstances.\n\nDay-to-day operations of a company involve taking a lot of decisions. Decision\nmaking involved not only the decisions taken by the top management but also\nthe decisions each employee needs to take to optimize their output. Counting\nthese altogether, there are thousands of such decisions to be made each day\ndown the command line structure of any organization. The ultimate quality of\nthese scattered decisions determines organizational success or failure. Among\nthese, talent acquisition is such a function, the consequences of which can\ndecide the future of an organization.\n\n##  **Some Questions to Ask**\n\nWhen it comes to making the right decisions, it is all about asking apt\nquestions. Say, for example:\n\n  * How can you attract the best talents around to your company in each specialized area?\n  * How can you decide how the best ones look like?\n  * Where can you find these superstars for your organization?\n  * How could you reach to them and get them to agree to leave their current jobs and join you?\n  * What compensation should you offer them?\n  * Apart from payment, what are other factors they consider to join your firm?\n  * Whether you should approach them to pay higher for their quality and let them do their tasks professionally, or you should hunt for hires with lesser pay to bring into your system and improve their quality over time?\n  * When and how you should defend the hiring decisions to make others convinced that you made the right choice?\n\nGetting proper answers to these questions will determine the efficiency of\nyour talent acquisition process.\n\nBig data and analytics can be rightly applied to a range of decisions down the\nline in the process of talent acquisition. Following are some examples:\n\n  *  **Priorities:** You can use analytics here to decide which candidates to focus on and what resources to use. It is also important to decide how many resources need to be directed to each of them.\n\n  *  **Goals:** Decide whether you have to optimize talent acquisition for the cost, speed, quality, experience of the hire, or need to keep a fine balance of all these.\n\n  *  **Candidate characteristics:** While doing analytics for talent acquisition, consider which characteristics need to favor the process of acquisition to produce high-quality hires.\n\n  *  **Company culture:** To ensure the most efficient process and produce the best results, you need to keep the company culture in mind to stimulate an efficient process to solve a specific problem at hand.\n\n  *  **Screening instruments:** Consider which selection instruments or methods you should use to filter down the applicants. These could be structured and unstructured interviews, sample job tasks, personality tests, integrity assessments, aptitude tests, cognitive skill tests, etc. It is also important to check physical ability for the tasks demanded. Medical inquiries, background check, criminal history check, etc. could also be used.\n\nFor analytics, it is also important to consider when and where should you\ninvest the resources and which channels, technology, staff, training, and\ntechniques need to be used to support the process. All these decisions add up\nand impact the success or failure of an organization. There is no doubt that\noptimized talent acquisition may lead to increased competitive advantages for\nany organization. If there is an attrition rate of about 25 percent a year and\nthe talent acquisition efforts of the organization only produce less-than-\naverage hires, then it won't take more than two years to be lost half (or\nmore) of your employees, which is below industry average. So, big data and\nanalytics play a crucial role in terms of talent acquisition and, in turn, act\nas the decisive factor between the success or failure of an organization.\n\n_Opinions expressed here are the opinions of the author.

New\ntechnologies and advanced hiring practices undoubtedly played a hand, and this\ndisruption shows no signs of slowing as we enter the new decade. Let's see how\ninnovation and social expertise will shape 2020 and beyond.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n### **1\\. Natural Language Processing**\n\n  \nThe single biggest trend shaping recruitment in 2020 will be the use of\nartificial intelligence (AI) to the source, assess, and screen employees. The\npower of natural language processing (NLP) tools is set to make a key change\nat every step of the way.\n\nManually screening resumes is still one of the most time-consuming tasks\nrecruiters face, but with NLP, the best applicants can be identified swiftly.\nNLP can also be used to interact with potential candidates and offer\npersonalized communication with the latest chatbot technology. Finally, NLP\nand voice recognition are being combined to help analyze and review candidate\ninterviews.\n\nHowever, human bias is easily carried into the behavior of any AI model.\nOrganizations must ensure those producing the algorithms do so in compliance\nwith the company-approved anti-bias guidelines [to avoid\nthis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/business/algorithm-bias-fix.html)\nscenario.\n\n### **2\\. Predictive analytics**\n\n  \nRecommender systems and predictive analytics will begin to play a larger role\nin the recruiting processes of many companies.\n\nVarious technology players on the market already allow recruiters to identify\nthe best matches for a job based on numerous parameters, such as location,\npast experience, education, and relationship networks. This is taken a step\nfurther with predictive analytics and recommender systems that provide\nrecruiters with additional insights. These systems are able to generate\nselective lists of candidates who are best fitted for the job on offer and\neven uncover candidates that are not actively seeking new opportunities.\n\nIn addition to making the employee selection process faster or activating a\ndormant talent pool, intelligent systems can also signal when a current\nemployee is getting ready to quit a current job. Smart recruiters will be\nusing these insights to make the most appropriate interventions and talent\ndecisions.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **3\\. Remote work**\n\n  \nFlexible schedules and work-from-home policies are turning into one of the\nmost sought after benefits that job candidates look for, and organizations\nneed to adapt to the work aspirations of their employees.\n\nThat's why we increasingly see more and more fully-remote companies. By\nallowing people to work remotely, companies are also increasing their talent\npool because now they can access global talent without the limitations of\ngeographical boundaries.\n\nAs such, we will see an increase in the use of tools and technologies that\nhelp manage remote teams, including virtual offices, augmented and virtual\nreality work environments, as well as advanced multi-media communication\ntools.\n\n### **4\\. Work culture**\n\n  \nCulture is the glue that binds a company together. However, the increase in\nremote work makes building and maintaining a solid company culture more\nchallenging. Therefore, it will become increasingly critical for organizations\nto put effort into rallying the employees around their core values, company\nmission, and overall vision.\n\nWe will see a rise in organizations creating a dedicated role to focus solely\non building company culture and team cohesion. Part of the challenge will be\nto blend a company culture that can be embraced by baby boomers, Gen Z, and\nMillennials - and their varying expectations and career aspirations - alike.\n\n### **5\\. Acqui-hires**\n\n  \nPeople are one of the most valuable assets in any company. While they may not\nshow up in the balance sheet, employees often represent the bulk of a\ncompany's value. That's why we are likely to see a growing number of\nacquihires happening on the market.\n\nAs recruiters increasingly spend more time and money to find the perfect\ncandidates, talent acquisition competition grows. Recruiters are therefore\nlooking to different avenues to proactively and quickly build up talent pools.\nBuying up companies for their human capital is one of these techniques.\n\nHowever, recruiters should be mindful of culture clash during this process,\nwhich can limit the smooth integration of the companies involved. Dedicating a\nmultidisciplinary team to facilitate cultural integration is paramount to the\nsuccess of all acquihires.\n\n### **6\\. Social media recruiting**\n\n  \nAs recruiters reach for the extra mile, the logical step is to go where their\npotential candidates really are, and most of them are already on social media.\nWith increased mobile usage and on-the-go interactions, recruiters will\nincreasingly capture users' attention on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThat's why in 2020, we will witness more use of recruiting hashtags and eye-\ncatching content, including videos, as part of recruitment marketing. We will\nalso see more organizations encourage employees to share their winning content\nto lure in new employees and build up their recruiting clout.\n\n### **7\\. Diversity**\n\n  \nIt's been proven numerous times that diverse teams perform better, so ever\nmore HR departments, staffing agencies, and recruiting firms will have\ndesignated staff dedicated exclusively to increasing diversity at the\ncompanies they serve.\n\nOrganizations will put more effort into tailoring job postings to attract more\ndiverse candidates, reshape the language in job descriptions to be more\ngender-neutral, and advertise jobs in diverse community groups. We will also\nsee an increase in the number of staffing agencies that are specialized in\ndiversity, challenging the status quo around underrepresented gender, race,\nand other similar demographics.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **8\\. Employer branding**\n\n  \nPeople want to work at companies that they can be proud of. Therefore, the\nmost important thing for an employer is to build their employer brand and make\nthe vision and mission of the company crystal clear.\n\nAccording to a [study](http://web.careerarc.com/op-employer-branding-\nstudy.html) by CareerArc, 75% of job seekers consider an employer's brand\nbefore applying, so building content around employee experience is crucial.\nThat's why we will see more organizations focused on building website sections\ndedicated to the company mission, employee life and stories, and other\nrelevant employer branding content.\n\n### **9\\. Soft skills**\n\n  \nAccording to a LinkedIn [study](https://www.fastcompany.com/90298828/linkedin-\nresearch-reveals-the-value-of-soft-skills), 89% of bad hires typically lack\nsoft skills such as creativity, persuasion, teamwork, collaboration,\nadaptability, and time management. But identifying such skills has\ntraditionally been a challenge, which is why recruiters are looking to revamp\ntheir assessment processes as the demand grows.\n\nRecruiters will be increasingly interested in learning from a candidate's body\nlanguage and choice of words, as well as previous behavioral patterns,\nteamwork dynamics, ethical dilemmas, conflict resolution, and other similar\nfactors.\n\nAnother soft skill that is gaining increased prominence is the candidates'\nability to build large networks across various industries and sectors. Digital\nplatforms allow employees to amplify the reach of any company message through\ntheir own networks, providing a significant competitive advantage in sales,\nrecruiting, fundraising, and overall reach.\n\n### **10\\. Hiring quality**\n\n  \nTechnology can be leveraged to assess new candidates, but it can also be\nprogressively used to measure the performance of the recruiting team itself.\nWhile the cost and time-to-hire are easier to quantify, the quality is a\nlittle harder to assess.\n\nRecruiters will experiment with AI models that provide deeper insights into\nthe quality of their hires by analyzing various defined metrics and overall\nperformance within the team over a set period of time. These models will take\ninto account not only hard skills and expertise but also new hires' soft\nskills and overall performance KPIs.\n\n_Do you have any recruitment trends in mind?

It is the field of analytics that deals with the analysis of\norganization employees in order to improve employee retention and\norganizational performance. It is an advanced set of data analysis\napplications and tools used to measure and analyze operation, performance, and\nimprovement. HR analytics is a mixture of methodology and software that works\non the statistical model in order to deliver work-related data, which enables\nthe company\u2019s decision-makers to optimize and enhance human resource\nmanagement. Digitization and automation of conventional HR tools remove human\ninaccuracy and provide a proper analysis of organization operational trends.\n\nRising investment in technology-based HR solutions is one of the major factors\ndriving the growth of the global HR analytics market. The adoption of\ntechnology has moved from static and conventional HR management solutions to\nmobile-based tools and dynamic platforms.

If companies want\nto attract the best talent, keeping employees not only happy but also engaged\nis an integral part of that success. Today\u2019s workforce, especially Millennials\nand Gen Z, want real-time recognition and access to information as we are\naccustomed to with our social media channels. People want to feel fully and\nimmediately integrated and connected into the day-to-day operations of an\norganization whether that\u2019s through the work itself or through meaningful\npersonal connections at work. Ultimately, a culture that is focused on\nlearning, development, and community will continue to be a driving factor of\nprolonged employee engagement.\n\n**What have been your most important observations for HR teams when it comes\nto balancing employees\u2019 needs, aspirations and expectations with the business\nleaders\u2019 vision?**\n\nThe highest performing organizations understand it\u2019s necessary to balance the\nneeds of their employees with the vision of the founders or C-suite\nleadership. In a workforce that is increasingly turning toward being employee-\ncentric, good business leaders will understand how to strike a perfect balance\nbetween celebrating the ideas and wants of both the employee and the\norganization. HR teams should aim to create a culture that benefits employees\nwhen it comes to environment and perks, while also encouraging hard work that\nmoves the company\u2019s mission forward. Business leaders should realize that\ntreating workers well is key to advancing a vision, and employees will work\nhard toward achieving that vision if their needs, aspirations and expectations\nare met. Ultimately, organizations that invest in their people will come out\nahead in the long run.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Why Employee Engagement Is so Important at Netguru: Q &A;\nWith Dorota Piotrowska**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-\nengagement/netguru-dorota-piotrowska-why-employee-engagement-is-important/)\n\n**What role does cloud-based HR and benefits platforms play in enabling better\nbusiness outcomes from HR?**\n\nCloud HR is required for companies to embrace the changing world of work. From\nfast implementation to the ability and agility to grow with the needs of the\nbusiness, to convenient access on the go for employees, and support for remote\nand contract workers, it\u2019s become evident cloud-based HR creates an easier,\nmore accessible and adaptable method for streamlining employee and department\ncommunication that ultimately increases employee engagement.\n\n**Happy and engaged employees perform better and stick around for longer. How\ncan employee engagement be regarded as a strategy for attaining business\ngoals?**\n\nEmployee engagement is one of the most important areas companies must focus on\nin order to attain other business goals. When employees are engaged, the\norganization will grow, and employees will achieve better, more streamlined\noutcomes, while also possessing a passion for work. As a strategy for reaching\nbusiness goals, HR professionals can approach engagement and retention through\nrecognizing the cost of turnover.\n\n> **Time spent recruiting, hiring, onboarding and training a new employee has\n> significant explicit and implicit costs, and it is within the company\u2019s\n> financial interest to invest in engaging employees to build long-term\n> relationships.**\n\n**How has the technology and especially, AI and Machine Learning transformed\nthe way employers approach employee engagement?**\n\nAside from being a digital admin, technology has made it easier than ever for\nHR, managers, and team leads to keep track of employee, engagement, and\nproductivity. Hibob\u2019s platform bob allows managers to conveniently assign and\nmanage onboarding tasks and workflows. With respect to AI and Machine\nLearning, these technological advances are facilitating ways for companies to\nfast-track what used to be tedious workplace processes, including everything\nfrom onboarding paperwork to performance review management and more. Overall,\nAI is allowing employees to focus on more worthwhile work and giving them the\nopportunity to cut back on time spent on more administrative tasks.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Drive Innovation in the Workplace: Q &A; with Kellie\nRomack of Hilton**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-\nengagement/kellie-romack-on-innovation-in-the-workplace/)\n\n**Distributed workforces have become the norm. How will this impact the\nmeasure of the success of employee engagement initiatives \u2013 both at the\nindividual and the organizational level?**\n\nWith a distributed workforce, measuring employee engagement faces a different\nset of challenges. While today\u2019s advances in communication technology have\nmade it remarkably easy to create a more global workforce, it becomes more\ndifficult to monitor engagement when teams and individuals are remote and in\nseparate locations. For example, Hibob has integrated both Slack and Microsoft\nTeams into the bob platform to facilitate employee engagement and facilitate\ncommunication for things like PTO, onboarding, and monitoring work progress.\nHR teams can ensure they are driving inclusion, sharing company values and\nculture regardless of location and finding creative ways to foster personal\nconnections between employees despite physical distance.\n\n> **With distributed workforces, it is best to implement a steady cadence of\n> routine check-ins and evaluations with individuals, more than they would if\n> the whole team was in the same physical office. It is also beneficial to\n> keep employee morale high through initiating culture clubs or shout out and\n> inspiration boards to create a thriving culture for remote employees.**\n\n**What are the three most important reasons for HR managers to focus on more\ndata-driven decision making today?**\n\n  1. Today, data analysis is just as important to HR leaders as other C-suite leadership because HR teams are managing a company\u2019s most important asset and largest line item when it comes to the people that make up an organization. Data-driven decisions allow companies to predict and forecast retention, attrition and employment trends moving forward \u2013 allowing them to plan for staffing requirements and take a deeper dive into turnover and satisfaction rates at the company. Using this data, HR leaders can more accurately look ahead and adjust where necessary to improve the overall hiring process and employment experience.  \n\n  2. HR managers can use data to analyze how company resources are being allocated and ensure all employees are being treated equitably. For example, HR can work with financial teams to discern if employees are being paid fairly or ensure that there is age or gender equality in compensation.   \n\n  3. HR analytics to better understand organizational dynamics. For example, Hibob\u2019s people analytics capabilities provide data-based insight into employee diversity, efficiency, experience, and engagement. This gives insight into which employees are connected to colleagues across other teams, which employees are most influential across the larger organization and other relationships. Understanding every worker\u2019s individual role can give HR teams and managers a better understanding of how people are working in an office environment so they can double down on the strengths and address any potential weaknesses.\n\n**In order to embrace digital transformation in employee engagement processes,\nwhat are the new array of skillset and mindset changes that are needed in HR\nleadership and practice?**\n\n  1. With the increase in digital transformation, there will be an increased emphasis on HR leaders\u2019 ability to instruct and guide employees on how to use cutting edge workplace technology. For example, automation will increasingly take over and streamline workplace tasks, requiring HR leaders and managers to patiently guide and teach new technology and platforms to staff, and making sure they are engaged and confident while using them.  \n\n  2. HR leaders should focus on digital employee engagement at every stage, and HR and management should recognize that engagement should be implemented during the onboarding process as well. For example, the bob platform encourages new employees to bond by joining groups on the platform based on shared interests. Especially at larger enterprise firms, digital transformation can make it much easier to make friends and find others with shared interests.  \n\n  3. The metrics-driven engagement has become the new normal, and as such, HR leaders must remember the difference between team vs. tribe culture and engagement. As engagement grows more digital, it\u2019s important to remember that the company\u2019s overall engagement may be different from the employee\u2019s individual engagement with their direct team. HR and team leaders should always be searching for fun ways to drive team culture and engagement online. An example would be bob\u2019s Kudos feature, which allows managers and workers to give special appreciation for teams or individual employee accomplishments.\n\n  \n**Learn More:**[ **Designing the Employee Experience: Q &A; with Sonia\nFiorenza**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-\nengagement/sonia-fiorenza-on-employee-experience-strategies/)\n\n**What are the new HR developments at Hibob that you are excited about?**\n\nHibob is constantly innovating and looking towards the future in how we can\nhelp modern-day workplaces thrive.

(Photo by\nSSPL/Getty Images)\n\nSSPL via Getty Images\n\n_Unprecedented_. This word we all have been seeing and hearing a great deal\nlately is intended to encapsulate the enormity of surprise and the magnitude\nof change the world is undergoing at the moment. But it has another\nimplication. It admonishes many of us who are too comfortable with our\nignorance of history, too intellectually lazy to comprehend how one event\ndeterministically leads to another, or too fixated on \u201criding the wave\u201d to\nenvision and plan for its eventual crash.\n\nEvery occurrence and situation has a precedent. Unusual or uncommon?\nCertainly. However, we have experienced and recorded instances of pandemics\nand market crashes and inept leadership before. Indeed each occurrence is\ndifferent, but much can be learned by gathering and analyzing the data from\nthem, rather than just throwing up one's hands in complete inattentive\nignorance.\n\nToday In: [CIO Network](https://www.forbes.com/cio-network)\n\n  * [\n\n### Former IBM CIO Has Driven A Remarkable Digital Transformation As COO Of\nWorld Fuel Services\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2020/04/07/former-ibm-cio-has-driven-\na-remarkable-digital-transformation-as-coo-of-world-fuel-services/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How CIOs Can Maintain A Strong Culture Amid The Shift To Remote Work\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevennorton/2020/04/02/how-cios-can-maintain-\na-strong-culture-amid-the-shift-to-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Microsoft Teams Has Seen A 775% Rise In Users In Italy Because Of COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martingiles/2020/03/30/microsoft-cloud-\nservice-775-percent-rise-covid-19/)\n\nAlan Simon, author and managing principal of Thinking Helmet, observes how\ncomplacency can set in, especially in a long period of economic boom. He\ncontends that \u201cthis leads to \u2018unprecedented\u2019 mega-events that aren't actually\nunprecedented, and which might have been interdicted, at least in part.\u201d\n\nTake the Texas-based grocer H-E-B for example. Its own pandemic planning began\nback in 2005 when the H5N1 virus first appeared, and the plan was first\nexecuted in 2009 when the H1N1 swine flu surfaced. According to Justen Noakes,\ndirector of emergency preparedness, \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to revise it, and it\u2019s\nbeen a part of our preparedness plan at H-E-B ever since.\u201d He says the first\nweek of February they dusted it off and started working on step-one\nimmediately. From hurricanes to pandemics, H-E-B has modeled potential effects\nof these potential major disruptions upon its supply chain, customer demand,\nand employee availability. When the situation warrants, H-E-B activates its\nEmergency Operations Center, which in addition to Noakes includes a director\nof government and public affairs, and even a chief medical officer and medical\nboard.\n\nEven when no specific precedent exists, human imagination can fill the gap. At\nthe beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, BMC Software, then under the\nleadership of CEO Jim Beauchamp, devised a set of simple-to-understand, color-\ncoded scenarios for the various directions the economy might head. A\nhistorically military tool dating back thousands of years, scenario planning\nimagines a set of \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d each triggering particular actions. Not only did\nthis scenario planning enable BMC to respond quickly, even proactively, but it\ngave comfort and a needed morale boost to its employees.\n\nWhile scenario planning enables a rapid sense-and-respond capability for\nbusinesses, the technique is designed to anticipate, not \u201csee\u201d the future.\nAccording to Kishor Gummaraju, the chief customer officer at Tiger Analytics,\nmost forecasts have been built in a certain way, factoring in long term trends\nand averages. \u201cToday,\u201d he says, \u201call of those models are useless,\u201d and that\ncompanies have scrambled to implement more real-time models which also\nconsider proxies of business activity. Gummaraju believes this abrupt switch\nto more sophisticated forecasting will be here to stay, not a temporary one.\n\n> For too long, many organizations in the industries suffering today have been\n> navel-gazing at their own data with little interest or ability to ingest the\n> vast array of external data available.\n\nImproved forecasting, however, requires broader, faster and deeper data, not\njust fancier models. For too long, many organizations in the industries\nsuffering today have been navel-gazing at their own data with little interest\nor ability to ingest the vast array of external data available. With an\nestimated 10 million public \u201copen data\u201d sources, billions of websites with\ncontent ready to be harvested, thousands of commercial data products, emerging\ndata marketplaces, and data to be bartered for from your business partners and\nsuppliers, there is no excuse for ignoring the wide range of global economic\nfactors and their impact on your business. A handy rule of thumb: For every\none lagging indicator of past performance, your business should strive to\nidentify at least two leading indicators of future performance.\n\nSo how can IT leaders support their organizations in shifting from being\nparalyzed by the unprecedented to catalyzed by the precedented?\n\n  1. Help the business acknowledge that current forecasting models are likely broken and that continuing to rely on them may do more harm than good. \n  2. Work with data and analytics experts along with data product vendors to identify external leading indicators so that new driver-based models can be constructed. Recognize that traditional trailing indicators like jobless claims may now be leading indicators. \n  3. Identify the temporal and affinity relationships among the purchases of even seemingly unrelated products. This will be of more predictive value than ever before.\n  4. Increase investments in identifying and developing digital versions of your products and services that eliminate or reduce manual, hand-on, and face-to-face requirements. \n  5. Track and understand the evolving customer journey across channels. For example, continuing to separately report on online versus in-store activity increasingly will become ineffectual. \n  6. Keep a close eye on customer sentiment and social consumer social media activity, as this will be a key bellweather for resumed and diminishing consumption in most sectors. \n  7. Begin gathering multi-level (or \u201cn-tier\u201d) supply chain data about your suppliers\u2019 suppliers to identify weaknesses or resumption of material availability. And expand the information you gather and analyze about alternate suppliers. \n  8. Factor-in the effects of prior events like severe weather or other economic bubble bursts to improve forecasts locally and nationally or globally.\n  9. Coordinate with the executive team and an economist to identify a range of economic scenarios and execution plans for each. \n  10. Implement (then never disband) a formal crisis or emergency response team and operating model which includes key individuals from marketing, sales, finance, legal, operations, HR, public relations, and IT to coordinate these above activities. This team should be supported by experts in economics, data science, third-party data products, and data integration/engineering.\n\nThat said, the most capacious and enduring opportunities arising from this\ncurrent global crisis, perhaps even \u201cunprecedented\u201d ones, won\u2019t come from\nimproved analytic models, but rather from new innovative business models and\noperating models. No doubt meant as a spiritual challenge but just as apropos\nin a business context, Vanderbilt University Chabad\u2019s Rabbi Shlomo Rothstein\nobserves, \u201cWe now have an incredible opportunity to reimagine the future and\nenvision those wonderful new realities that we can\u2019t usually see when stuck in\nthe limitations of success, routine, and predictability.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/doug_laney) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaney).

But in many ways, traditional working models hinder this\nprocess, because they don\u2019t offer on-time insights.\n\nConsider the typical annual review cycle \u2013 performance is assessed every\nyear/biannually. The employee understands problem areas and spends the next\nsix months or year on improvements.\n\nThis means that for actual change to show in the workplace, organizations are\nleft waiting for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nBy adopting a continuous improvement approach in the HR process, you can push\nyour workforce to adapt faster, respond to the need at hand, and reach all new\nheights of productivity.\n\nAnd HR analytics can help you do this efficiently.\n\n**_Learn More:[How to Use Monitoring to Boost Employee\nProductivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-use-\nmonitoring-to-boost-employee-productivity/)_**\n\n## **What Is Continuous Improvement in HR?**\n\nContinuous improvement was popularized back in the 1950s as part of Toyota\u2019s\nmanufacturing strategy. Since then, it has had a pervasive impact on project\nmanagement across industries.\n\nMost recently, startups and agile software development teams have adopted this\napproach to reach their goals faster while minimizing waste of time and\nresources.\n\nAs HR, you can incorporate the principles of continuous improvement to help\nemployees achieve their individual/organizational productivity targets. This\nincludes:\n\n  * Training the workforce to be creative without relying on traditional solutions to solve new problems. \n  * Inculcating an approach to work that aims for long-term success through multiple iterations if required, instead of taking on the pressure to get it right the first time. \n  * Building a data-driven culture where information, insights, and opinions are solicited from a variety of sources for the next work cycle.\n  * Breaking down the idea of \u201cperfection\u201d and focusing on small, ongoing steps towards improvement.   \n\nFor example, as an HR practitioner, you can roll out a standalone L&D; course\nfor a small part of the workforce, test how well this group adopts it, review\nits impact on productivity, and only then decide on further investments.\n\nThrough this approach, employees are pushed to learn more than what is\nimmediately necessary, and organizations save significant amounts of costs and\neffort.\n\nHowever, continuous improvement cannot take place in a vacuum.\n\nThe popularity of this model in the last decade is partly due to the\nwidespread use of project management platforms.\n\nThese platforms show precisely where an employee stands on the improvement\npathway, the effort contributed, and the time remaining to achieve defined\ngoals.\n\nIn HR, you can use people analytics to stay updated on employee progress and\nchannel efforts in the direction most suited for continuous improvement.\n\n**_Learn More:[Why Employee Productivity Analytics is Key to Organizational\nAgility](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/why-employee-\nproductivity-analytics-is-key-to-organizational-agility/)_**\n\n## **Why HR Analytics Aids Continuous Improvement**\n\nAnalytics is now a buzzword in the HR space, and with good reason.\n\nYou can access a vast repository of employee data at a glance. Hours or even\ndays needed to build reports are now taken over by automation. And real-time\nanalytics can help you make decisions when they matter the most.\n\nFor continuous improvement, staying informed of the current scenario at any\npoint in time is at the heart of this concept.\n\nEach iterative cycle \u2013 whether in manufacturing, software development, or HR \u2013\nis based on the results of the last one. The shorter your improvement cycle,\nthe stronger its impact.\n\n[HR analytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\nhr-analytics/) can give you insights immediately at any point in time. In\naddition, [predictive HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/predictive-analytics-in-hr-whats-next-in-2019/) deliver\naccurate projections of \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios.\n\nYou no longer have to analyze historical records to understand future needs\nmanually. Adopting a predictive model helps your framework stay one step\nahead, allowing you to anticipate the factors that may define the course of\nthe next cycle.\n\nFor example, the people analytics solution provider [Viser has a dedicated\npredictive analytics module](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-\nanalytics/visier-introduces-new-models-to-empower-businesses-with-future-\ninsights/) for talent acquisition, helping you to take the right decision on\nyour next hiring campaign based on past results.\n\n## **3 HR Analytics Metrics That Aid Continuous Improvement**\n\nHere are three areas where analytics data can help to introduce continuous\nimprovement in HR.\n\n### 1\\. Scheduling insights to better allocate people assets  \n\n[Workforce scheduling](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/category/workforce-\nscheduling/) is a complex process, dependent on multiple stakeholders, demand\nflux, and company targets.\n\nBy gathering data on which scheduling practices are most effective and how\nemployees would prefer to put in the time, you can maximize your available\npeople assets.\n\nModern task scheduling solutions such as [Shyft\n](https://www.myshyft.com/features/)come with powerful analytics features that\noffer real-time data via business dashboards. This is particularly useful for\nhourly and deskless workers.\n\n### 2\\. Candidate/Talent analytics to improve hiring outcomes  \n\nHiring the best candidate for a position is a key part of HR responsibilities,\nand analytics can help you ensure that each hiring cycle is better than the\nlast.\n\nLook for platforms like [Pulsifi](https://pulsifi.me/), which give you a\ncomprehensive overview of employee-to-role/team/organization alignment, map\ntheir performance, and offer a dynamic picture of how personal traits\ntranslate into productivity.\n\nUsing such data can help you make better hiring decisions in each hiring\ncycle, allowing you to make incremental improvements in every cycle.\n\n### 3\\. Data from chatbots for continuous updates  \n\nConversational interfaces can be a great source of data in real time.\n\nFor example, a chatbot can collect information on multiple team requirements\nand product status to accurately answer employee questions.\n\nIntegrating chatbots into daily workflows will, in turn, ensure that\ncontinuous improvement becomes part of daily workflows, powered by data\ncontinually collected by the bot.\n\nTeleopti offers a solution on these lines called\n[Grant](https://www.teleopti.com/landing-pages/grant) \u2013 a Microsoft AI-based\nchatbot for data-driven employee self-service.\n\nRegular data collection allows you to get a pulse of the organization. This\nmeans you can roll out smaller changes faster. Employees can have their needs\nmet quicker and will remain better engaged at work.\n\n**_Learn More:[How to Get Started with Implementing HR\nAnalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-get-\nstarted-with-implementing-hr-analytics/)_**\n\n## **Integrate Your Ecosystem for Sustained Improvements**\n\nOne of the major barriers to analytics implementation is the siloed nature of\nbusiness processes.\n\nDespite data pouring in from multiple areas, it is difficult to turn this data\ninto actual improvements because there is no single source of truth.\n\nIt is a good idea for HR to start by creating a unified process environment\nwith centralized control and visibility.\n\n[Sapling](https://www.saplinghr.com/) is an HR platform that can connect to\nthe tools and software you are already using for productivity \u2013 it then uses\n[\u201cAI-powered automation and predictive insights\u201d to make every decision more\neffective](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-analytics/sapling-\nreceives-4-mn-in-seed-funding-round-to-build-next-gen-workforce-management-\nsolution/).\n\nAs organizations rethink their processes to succeed in an agile and dynamic\nbusiness environment, the continuous improvement approach will gain more\ntraction in HR.\n\nAnd real-time data, advanced analytics, and smartly designed business\ndashboards can help you link short-term improvements to long-term market\nleadership.\n\n_Are you using analytics for the continuous improvement of your workforce?_\n_Tell us how on_[ _Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

While there is understandable concern about\n[what this means for human jobs](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-\nelement-\ncse&cx=016722361883844155001:yfaatio9mvc&q=https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp%3FcontentID%3D1422&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi1puSC0L_nAhUGdBQKHbV6Bk4QFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw2W0Wc1XbKiSDXXe1pAzV0s\n\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-\ncse&cx=016722361883844155001:yfaatio9mvc&q=https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp%3FcontentID%3D1422&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi1puSC0L_nAhUGdBQKHbV6Bk4QFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw2W0Wc1XbKiSDXXe1pAzV0s\"),\nI still believe this is an exciting time for businesses \u2013 and the people who\nwork in them.\n\n![Future Of People Analytics: What Lies Ahead For Data-Driven\nHR?](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e463882a854780006b152eb/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nFuture Of People Analytics: What Lies Ahead For Data-Driven HR?\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nIntelligent, data-driven HR is transforming many aspects of how HR teams serve\nthe people in their organizations. The technology is changing fast, too \u2013\nfaster than even I would have anticipated five years ago. That means how HR\nteams function in just a few years\u2019 time will probably be very different\nagain. But, even amidst this uncertainty, some things are crystal clear about\nthe future of data-driven HR. Here are my top three predictions:\n\n**HR will have a unique role to play in this data- and AI-driven world**\n\nThe proliferation of data analytics, IoT-enabled devices, and AI tools is only\ngoing to continue, and this will carry on impacting the way HR works, just\nlike every other area of the business.\n\nIn this changing environment, the challenge for HR teams is to find a balance\nbetween technology (particularly automation) and the human role in the\norganizations of the future. I believe the biggest challenge facing HR teams\ngoing forward is not keeping up with technology and learning new skills like\ndata analysis, it's finding the uniquely human place in the organization \u2013 and\nwithin the HR team itself.\n\nTherefore, the HR teams of today need to be thinking about what HR will look\nlike in the future, and this includes what exactly can be automated, and what\ncan\u2019t. They need to figure out HR\u2019s contribution to the workplace of the\nfuture.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll ever reach a point where [the HR function is\nentirely redundant](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-still-need-hr-teams-\nwhen-have-robots-ai-bernard-marr/ \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-still-\nneed-hr-teams-when-have-robots-ai-bernard-marr/\"). But the role of HR will\nundoubtedly shift away from the more administrative tasks around people\nmanagement (which can be easily automated in the future) to activities that\nhelp the organization meet its goals. It's vital that HR [delivers real\nvalue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/13/why-data-is-hrs-\nmost-important-asset/#4f41f7656b0f\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/13/why-data-is-hrs-most-\nimportant-asset/#4f41f7656b0f\") and unique benefits that cannot be delivered\nby any other function in the organization.\n\n**When it comes to coping with automation, HR must lead the way**\n\nThere\u2019s no escaping automation. It\u2019s therefore important for everyone, in\nevery job and every industry, to consider the implications of our increasingly\nautomated world, and how automation might affect their job and employment\nprospects over the coming years.\n\nFor HR teams, this is particularly pertinent. Not only are HR professionals\nfinding their own way in this new world, but they also have to equip the\npeople in their organization with the essential skills for helping the\nbusiness succeed in the future. So if you're an HR professional wondering how\non earth to navigate these changes, don\u2019t panic. These three steps will help\nyou figure out your unique role in the organization and boost your personal\ndevelopment.\n\n\u00b7         **Consider the future of your job:** Think hard about how much of\nwhat you do every day is repetitive and could potentially be done by\nintelligent algorithms or robots. It\u2019s now possible to completely or partially\nautomate many HR tasks. But the areas that computers still struggle with\ninclude creativity, problem-solving and connecting with people on a human\nlevel \u2013 all of which are vital skills in HR. These are the areas where HR can\nadd real value to the organization, so it makes sense to develop your skills\nin these areas and reshape your job to do more of the things that robots or\nalgorithms can\u2019t.\n\n\u00b7         **Become data-savvy:** You don\u2019t have to become a data scientist,\nbut it\u2019s important to have a good understanding of the [possibilities of\ndata](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/11/5-inspiring-ways-\norganizations-are-using-hr-data/#432d34518722\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/11/5-inspiring-ways-\norganizations-are-using-hr-data/#432d34518722\") and how it can help you solve\nproblems, be more efficient and make your employees happier. Demonstrating\nthat you can use data in original ways to solve key problems is a sure-fire\npath to success in the information age.\n\n\u00b7         **Make friends with your AI colleagues:** AI is being adopted at an\nincredible rate. We can see that with the huge popularity of AI assistants\nlike Alexa and Siri. This type of technology is fast becoming commonplace in\nour workplaces, too, which understandably makes people nervous. HR teams\nshould be leading the way in embracing AI technology and showing how\ncollaborating with AI systems can drive efficiencies and help the business\nsucceed.\n\n**The future is bright for intelligent, data-driven HR**\n\nI've worked with so many different HR teams over the years, and, in my\nexperience, the world of data and numbers isn't exactly what gets the average\nHR professional's heart racing. Most HR professionals go into the job because\nthey're intrinsically people focused \u2013 they're interested in human\ninteraction, not analyzing datasets. So, if you\u2019re concerned, you need to\nbecome a data scientist to keep your job, you can relax. I believe the\nopposite is true.\n\nThe great news is that a lot of the AI and machine learning tools coming onto\nthe market will allow us to automatically analyze HR data and generate\nvaluable insights. With the machines taking care of the data analysis and\ninsight generation, HR professionals can focus on what they do best: working\nwith people.\n\n  \n\nRead more about how data and analytics are transforming every aspect of HR,\nand what this means for the future, in my book [_Data-Driven\nHR_](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\") _._ It\u2019s packed with\nreal-life examples and practical ways HR teams can deliver maximum value in\nour increasingly data-driven world.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@bernardmarr) or\n[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr).

Technology strategists look at the outdated and manual\nprocesses that still occur across HR and Rewards as the perfect opportunity\nfor automation solutions. At the same time, organizations see the huge cost of\nresourcing and want to find new ways of recruiting and retaining employees,\nbuilding talent pools and maximizing their investments.\n\nWith digital transformation expected to strongly impact all areas of HR from\nthe nature of work, the future skills required for an organization\u2019s\nworkforce, to the delivery of reward, we are at the cusp of significant, even\ntransformative changes. However, understanding how specific digital solutions\naddress the individual requirements of your organization is vital. Even more\nimportant though is the need to ensure you are putting these technology\nsolutions in the hands of HR and reward leaders that can make the most of\nthem.\n\nThis will require a transformation in HR skills that is just as significant as\nany technology investment. Get it right and organizations can expect to not\nonly maximize ROI on the technology but also mould their HR departments into\nones that are strategic business partners responsible for significant impact\non the company\u2019s bottom line, and also with the analytic capability to\nunderstand and make sense of a greater degree of data in the future.\n\n## **The HR Technology Revolution Is Upon Us**\n\nOrganizations are investing more than ever in HR technology as vendors develop\nsolutions that incorporate a range of innovative technologies. In the last\nyear, [organizations have increased their investment in HR technology by\n29%](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/bersin-\nlaunches-the-2019-hr-technology-market-report-heres-what-you-need-to-know/),\nresulting in the HR technology market growing by 10%.\n\nA range of trends are emerging, including the shift from engagement to\nproductivity in core systems, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the\nsignificance of gig workforce management.\n\nUnilever\u2019s use of AI is just one example of the change that is occurring. As a\nbusiness, it recruits more than 30,000 people a year and processes around 1.8\nmillion job applications. This obviously takes a lot of time and effort, so\nUnilever made use of AI in an online platform that enabled candidates to be\nassessed at home in front of a computer or mobile screen.\n\nWith the candidates asked to perform a series of tests, machine learning\nalgorithms then assessed their suitability for different roles, resulting in\n70,000 hours of interviews and assessments being saved from HR employees\u2019\ntime.\n\nApart from AI, another key area of innovation in this sector is HR analytics,\nwhich relates to the area of productivity. This emerging trend is a\nmethodology for creating insights on how investments in human capital assets\ncontribute to the success of an organization. This is done by applying\nstatistical methods to integrated HR, talent management, financial and\noperational data.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Human Resource Development (HRD)? Definition,\nFunctions, and Best Practices for Training\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nhuman-resource-development/)**\n\n## **Tech Solutions Without Data Skills Are Pointless**\n\nWhile these solutions and the results they produce will sound very tempting to\nChief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), companies should tread carefully in\ntheir vendor selection process.\n\nThe most important first step is to identify what the company really needs,\nrather than be sold the benefits of a particular technology. Practitioner-led\nsolutions, which have been built and are maintained by professionals with real\nHR industry experience, are usually the best option for organizations that\ndon\u2019t fully understand which solution fits their needs.\n\nThis consultative approach shouldn\u2019t end with sales and onboarding either. The\nbest practitioners will understand the importance of upskilling HR teams to\nmake the most of the new technology that should become a fundamental part of\nan HR employee\u2019s job.\n\n[Recent research from the CIPD](https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/people-\nanalytics-report_tcm18-43755.pdf) on people analytics shows how important this\nupskilling will be. At present, only half (54%) of companies think their HR\nteam has demonstrable numerical and statistical skills. In addition, only 40%\nthink those teams are able to tackle organization issues using analytics data.\n\nData science skills will play an increasingly important role within\norganizations that invest in the new wave of HR technologies, as these\norganizations look to make the most of their investments. That means having\nintellectually curious people who can interrogate and interpret the data,\ndeciphering where it has come from, what it tells them and what the anomalies\nare.\n\nOnce the skills are in place within the HR team, the next area ripe for\ndistribution is rewards. So much of HR analysis is linked to productivity,\nattraction, motivation, and retention which are all linked too, and very\ndependent on the reward. Yet, the traditional reward model of fixed structures\nand pay ranges within an organization does not easily lend itself to the\nadaptability and flexibility the future \u2018digital workforce\u2019 will require.\n\nThe absence of any system capable of consolidating and analyzing global reward\ndata, on a granular, employee-level, is a data gap that needs to be resolved,\nespecially for global organizations that require consistency in rewards across\nfunctions and countries.\n\nWorking with Unilever for seven years to build such a system to consolidate\nand analyze global reward data has made the reward more engaging and relevant\nfor employees. Unilever are now able to experiment with the data to truly\nunderstand what motivates their employees which will lead to greater employee\nretention and address a number of other workplace requirements, that soon will\nbecome mandatory for organizations like the gender pay gap, diversity\nreporting and more.\n\n## **Data-Driven HR Will Power Organization Transformation**\n\nThe benefits of this upskilling will not be limited to making the most of new\ntechnology either. By introducing data science as a core skill within HR\ndepartments, organizations can change their employees from people managers to\nbusiness strategists.\n\nThe HR professionals of the future will be advising organizations on\neverything from pay ratio adjustments and cost-effective locations to\nborderless workforces. This will be possible because they are able to act on\nthe data at their fingertips, developing interpretable models and explainable\nanalytical results that win over the confidence of key decision-makers.\n\nThis type of technology transformation within HR departments may seem like\nit's a long way off for some organizations, and achieving this change alone\ncould feel like a major success. However, once that first milestone has been\npassed, it cannot be a one-off event.\n\n**Learn More:[Automation Technology Makes Human Resources More\n\u2018Human\u2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/automation-technology-makes-human-resources-more-human/)**\n\nThe technology skills of today are attainable for anyone wanting to transform\ntheir career but these skills are also finite in their relevance. In fact, the\nhalf-life of a technology skill is thought to be just two years. Therefore\nindividuals will need to constantly refresh the ones they have, even if they\nhave only just been learned.\n\nThis will result in a bigger emphasis on relevant skills as opposed to years\nof experience when deciding how valuable an employee is, particularly as the\nopen marketplace for global talent expands. While such changes will affect all\naspects of work, HR departments that are able to change their practices now,\nmolding themselves into data-driven, skills-based teams, will be able to lead\nthis change across organizations.\n\n**Learn More:[Understanding the Essence of HR Digital\nTransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/understanding-the-essence-of-hr-digital-transformation/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+Professionals+Of+The+Future+Will+Be+Data+Scientists+First\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+Professionals+Of+The+Future+Will+Be+Data+Scientists+First&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR Professionals Of The Future Will Be Data\nScientists\nFirst&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-professionals-of-the-future-will-be-data-scientists-\nfirst%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

For a typical\ncompany, workforce costs total up to 70% of the cost of doing business. In\nfact, several studies performed a few years ago told a convincing story:\n\n  * EY found a [strong link](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR/$FILE/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR.pdf) between CFOs\u2019 level of involvement in strategic workforce planning and broader business performance.\n  * Bersin by Deloitte found that the share prices of companies with \u201cmature\u201d talent analytics [exceeded](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-people-analytics-maturity.pdf) those of their competitors by 30% over a three-year period.\n  * A survey by CEB (now Gartner) found that organizations could [increase gross profit margin](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-decision-support/human-resources/pdfs/from-workforce-reporting-to-impactful-talent-analytics.pdf) by an average of 4%, and save roughly $12 million for every $1 billion in revenue, by taking a leadership position in workforce analytics.\n\n#### **Strategic Insight**\n\nEarly adopters of workforce analytics aimed their effort at simply managing\nthe total cost of workforce (TCOW). Today, CFOs working closely with HR can\nuse market and industry trends to identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, uncover recruitment and retention challenges,\nproject ROI from HR initiatives, and pinpoint leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nCFOs can use talent data to bring strategic insight to talent acquisition and\ndeployment by:\n\n  * Identifying ways to lower the cost of hiring, assigning, and engaging a productive workforce\n  * Ensuring compensation, benefits, and other rewards are aligned with business performance\n  * Targeting better ways of capturing ROI from HR development and well-being programs\n  * Determining and addressing signs of faltering performance\n  * Isolating mismatches in areas like benefits utilization\n  * Detecting and implementing process improvements across the workforce\n\nData and people analytics remove much of the guesswork behind key management\nand operational issues, helping companies make smarter talent decisions, boost\nperformance, and even challenge conventional wisdom that can blind\norganizations over time.\n\n#### **Linking Performance and HR Programs**\n\nData analytics also creates new opportunities for insight into the return on\nHR programs. For example, a company can look at population health and absentee\ndata alongside plan participation and rewards data, and then compare the\nfindings to productivity data in order to identify compelling corollaries\nbetween well-being and business impact.\n\nFinding out a particular demographic poorly utilizes health care screenings\nallows a company to design responsive and more effective wellness campaigns.\n\nPeople analytics can identify cost anomalies, especially in multinational\noperations where jurisdictional regulations vary widely. For example, staffing\ncosts can vary significantly by geography due to variations in salary ranges,\nbenefits costs, and employment laws. Modeling allows decision-makers to\nanalyze these costs and determine the best geographies for specific roles.\n\n[Predictive analytics](https://www.cfo.com/analytics/2016/10/special-report-\npromise-predictive-analytics/) can reveal other management decision-making\nblind spots. Suppose a company is contemplating a hiring freeze as an answer\nto declining profit. That\u2019s a common-enough scenario, but by applying\npredictive analytics it may become clear that a reduced workforce and greater\nworkload would not meet production demands.\n\nFurther analysis may reveal that hiring contingent staff, along with paying\novertime, could cost more than the savings reaped through a hiring freeze.\n\n#### **The Right Information**\n\nManaging unstructured data is a growing challenge as employers try to extract\n\u201csignals\u201d from diverse data sources, data management packages, and integration\nand forecasting tools and methodologies.\n\nThe question is what specific data and analytics CFOs and CHROs should\nprioritize to manage financial risk and ensure adequate return on labor costs.\n\nHow should companies break down workforce analytics to provide strategic\ninsight? We think there are four main areas to tap into:\n\n_Healthcare analytics_ : The combination of population health, absentee, plan\nparticipation, wellness, and related financial data can help better influence\nthe physical health of a population and help people effectively manage their\nhealth.\n\n_Financial analytics_ : Defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans,\nequity, compensation, and other personal financial data, coupled with business\ndata, helps assess the ROI on reward spend and helps employees better manage\ntheir short- and long-term financial goals.\n\n_Diversity analytics_ : Talent management, learning and development,\nsuccession planning, and related metrics can help to build work environments\nand reward structures that meet the needs of a multi-generational workforce\nand support diversity and inclusion goals. Predictive analytics can also help\nto improve recruitment and retention strategies.\n\n_Engagement analytics_ : Similar to external marketing efforts, internally\nfocused employee engagement analytics allow organizations to measure and\npredict how people react to program design, communication outreach, and market\nforces.\n\nThis combination of health, wealth, career, and engagement analytics provides\nthe insight needed to make the most effective investments in people and gives\nthem the tools they need to remain healthy and productive at work and in life.\n\nWithout that clear connection between employee performance and the\norganization\u2019s performance, managers can\u2019t properly evaluate and reward\nindividuals. Employees lose sight of where they fit into the big picture and\nbecome less engaged in the work. The company\u2019s overall performance suffers.\n\n#### **Analytics at the Right Time, in the Right Format**\n\nWhat leaders should be looking for is a single, intuitive, and responsive\nreporting system that eliminates the task of data validation and gives the CFO\nthe tools to start driving business performance.\n\nOne-off reports from disparate talent data sources \u2014 accomplished through\nspreadsheets, manual processes, IT coding, and the like \u2014 won\u2019t provide the\nstrategic insights needed to understand, predict, and monitor business risks.\n\nFind a workforce analytics platform that:\n\n  * Consolidates both financial and people data\n  * Doesn\u2019t solely rely on HRIS analytics for the evaluation of people data\n  * Gathers full people data across performance, talent, population health, engagement, and rewards inputs\n  * Establishes current-state baseline as a control measure\n  * Assesses and predicts true \u201creturn on people\u201d analysis with total cost of labor along with perceived and actual value derived from that labor, with the ability to segment to any business function\n  * Benchmarks this data against peers and ideal state\n  * Allows both HR and finance to model business and people scenarios for informed workforce decisions\n\n**Looking at Performance Through the Right Lens**\n\nToday\u2019s CFOs are not just on point to guide company financial performance.\nThey need to touch everything in the company\u2019s value chain, most definitely\nincluding the workforce.

HR analytics is defined as the\nprocess of measuring the impact of HR metrics, such as time to hire and\nretention rate, on business performance._\n\nHuman resources is a people-oriented function and is so perceived by most\npeople. But for those who think that the HR team\u2019s contributions are limited\nto extending offer letters and onboarding new hires, human resource analytics\n(HR analytics) can prove them wrong.

This is done by applying statistical methods to\nintegrated HR, talent management, financial, and operational data,\u201d says\nCollins in an exclusive discussion with HR Technologist.\n\nHR analytics focuses primarily on the HR function and is not \u2013 as is largely\nbelieved \u2013 exactly interchangeable with **[people\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\npeople-analytics/)** or workforce analytics.\n\n### I. HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce Analytics: What is the\nDifference?\n\nThe terms HR analytics, people analytics, and workforce analytics are often\nused interchangeably. But there are slight differences between each of these\nterms. It would help you to know the difference to be able to assess the most\nrelevant data to their function.\n\n![The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics**\n\n**HR analytics:** HR analytics specifically deals with the metrics of the HR\nfunction, such as time to hire, training expense per employee, and time until\npromotion. All these metrics are managed exclusively by HR for HR.\n\n**People analytics:** People analytics, though comfortably used as a synonym\nfor HR analytics, is technically applicable to \u201cpeople\u201d in general. It can\nencompass any group of individuals even outside the organization. For\ninstance, the term \u201cpeople analytics\u201d may be applied to analytics about the\ncustomers of an organization and not necessarily only employees.\n\n**Workforce analytics:** Workforce analytics is an all-encompassing term\nreferring specifically to employees of an organization. It includes on-site\nemployees, remote employees, gig workers, freelancers, consultants, and any\nother individuals working in various capacities in an organization.\n\nIn the HR context, some workforce analytics metrics and HR analytics metrics\nmay overlap, which is why the two terms are often used as synonyms. The goal\nof the two may also be the same.\n\nFor instance, data on employee productivity and performance informs both HR\nand workforce analytics, and the goal is to improve retention rates and\nenhance the employee experience.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Human Capital Management\n(HCM)?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)\n\n### II. How Does HR Analytics Drive Business Value?\n\nHR has access to valuable employee data. How can this data be used to enable\nchange in the organization?\n\nThere is a great deal of discussion on replicating the consumer experience in\nthe employee experience. Essentially, the data on consumer behavior and\nmindset can help develop strategies to maximize sales by capitalizing on those\nfactors. Similarly, the data useful for the HR function can be used to improve\nemployee performance, the employee experience, and in turn, maximize business\noutcomes.\n\nCollins offers an example of how HR analytics can be used to enhance business\nvalue. \u201cHR analytics could be used to measure investments in reskilling, which\nwill deliver the right competencies to support a new revenue model, using\ndata-driven insights to modify the training offering as sales results emerge.\u201d\n\nThis is definitive granular data that can not only impact the bottom line, it\ncan also transform **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** in an organization.\n\n\u201cAs such,\u201d Collins continues, \u201cyou might think about the \u2018ROI\u2019 of HR analytics\nbeing that of increasing the business value derived from using data for talent\ndecisions.\u201d\n\n## **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n\n**![Common metrics measured by HR analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common metrics measured by HR analytics**\n\nSeveral HR metrics contribute to business value, but the key question when\nmeasuring these metrics is this: what does the business need?\n\nThis question can be best answered by having a conversation with business\nleaders. A strategic collaboration between the C-suite and HR leaders will\nhelp determine the HR analytics strategy.\n\nBased on the key performance indicators (KPI) of the organization, HR can then\npropose the metrics that can influence these KPIs.\n\nIt is important to note that the C-suite sees a clear connection between the\nneed for analytics and the impact it will have on the bottom line. As an HR\npractitioner, you will need to build a case for why tracking metrics related\nspecifically to the people of the company is critical.\n\nFor instance, the C-suite may not be interested in the number of people who\nhave left the organization voluntarily. What might interest them is how many\nof these employees were in strategic positions or were highly skilled, the\nduration of their employment, what led to their exit, the cost of replacing\nthese employees, and finally, how all these events affect company profits.\n\nHere are some common metrics tracked by HR analytics:\n\n**1\\. Revenue per employee:** Obtained by dividing a company\u2019s revenue by the\ntotal number of employees in the company. This indicates the average revenue\neach employee generates. It is a measure of how efficient an organization is\nat enabling revenue generation through employees.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rate:** The number of accepted formal job offers (not\nverbal) divided by the total number of job offers given in a certain period. A\nhigher rate (above 85%) indicates a good ratio. If it is lower, this data can\nbe used to redefine the company\u2019s talent acquisition strategy.\n\n**3\\. Training expenses per employee:** Obtained by dividing the total\ntraining expense by the total number of employees who received training. The\nvalue of this expense can be determined from measuring the training\nefficiency. Poor efficiency may lead you to re-evaluate the training expense\nper employee.\n\n**4.** **Training efficiency:** Obtained from the analysis of multiple data\npoints, such as performance improvement, test scores, and upward transition in\nemployees\u2019 roles in the organization after training. Measuring training\nefficiency can be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program.\n\n**5\\. Voluntary turnover rate:** Voluntary turnover occurs when employees\nvoluntarily choose to leave their jobs. It is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left voluntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can lead to the identification of gaps in the\n[**employee experience**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/) that are leading to voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n**6\\. Involuntary turnover rate:** When an employee is terminated from their\nposition, it is termed \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The rate is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left involuntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can be tied back to the recruitment strategy and\nused to develop a plan to improve the quality of hires to avoid involuntary\nturnover.\n\n**7\\. Time to fill:** The number of days between advertising a job opening and\nhiring someone to fill that position. By measuring the time to fill,\nrecruiters can alter their recruitment strategy to identify areas where the\nmost time is being spent.\n\n**8\\. Time to hire:** The number of days between approaching a candidate and\nthe candidate\u2019s acceptance of the job offer. Just like time to fill, data-\ndriven analysis of time to hire can benefit recruiters and help them improve\nthe **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nto reduce this time.\n\n**9\\. Absenteeism:** Absenteeism is a productivity metric, which is measured\nby dividing the number of days missed by the total number of scheduled\nworkdays. Absenteeism can offer insights into overall employee health and can\nalso serve as an indicator of employee happiness.\n\n**10\\. Human capital risk:** This may include employee-related risks, such as\nthe absence of a specific skill to fill a new type of job, the lack of\nqualified employees to fill leadership positions, the potential of an employee\nto leave the job based on several factors, such as relationship with managers,\ncompensation, and absence of a clear succession plan. HR analytics can be used\nto measure all these metrics.\n\n## **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n\nBroadly, the data required by an HR analytics tool is classified into internal\nand external data. One of the biggest challenges in data collection is the\ncollection of the right data and quality data.\n\n**![Common data sources HR analytics solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common data sources HR analytics solutions**\n\n**I. Internal data**\n\n  \nInternal data specifically refers to data obtained from the HR department of\nan organization. The core HR system contains several data points that can be\nused for an HR analytics tool. Some of the metrics that an HRIS system\ncontains includes:\n\n1\\. Employee tenure  \n2\\. Employee compensation  \n3\\. Employee training records  \n4\\. Performance appraisal data  \n5\\. Reporting structure  \n6\\. Details on high-value, high-potential employees  \n7\\. Details on any disciplinary action taken against an employee\n\nThe only challenge here is that sometimes, this data is disconnected and so\nmay not serve as a reliable measure. This is where the data scientist can play\na meaningful role. They can organize this scattered data and create buckets of\nrelevant data points, which can then be used for the analytics tool.\n\n**II. External data**\n\n  \nExternal data is obtained by establishing working relationships with other\ndepartments of the organization. Data from outside the organization is also\nessential, as it offers a global perspective that working with data from\nwithin the organization cannot.\n\n**1\\. Financial data:** Organization-wide financial data is key in any HR\nanalysis to calculate, for instance, the revenue per employee or the cost of\nhire.\n\n**2\\. Organization-specific data:** Depending on the type of organization and\nits core offering (product or service), the type of data that HR needs to\nsupplement analytics will vary.\n\nFor example, says Collins, \u201cHR leaders at a global retailer should power their\nanalytics engine with store revenue and costs and customer experience data,\nwhereas HR at a construction company might pursue operational \u2013 health and\nsafety \u2013 data and data related to contingent labor costs.\u201d\n\n**3\\. Passive data from employees:** Employees continually provide data that\nis stored in the HRIS from the moment they are approached for a job.\nAdditionally, data from their social media posts and shares and from feedback\nsurveys can be used to guide HR data analysis.\n\n**4\\. Historical data:** Several global economic, political, or environmental\nevents determine patterns in employee behavior. Such data can offer insights\nthat limited internal data cannot.\n\nFor example, the recession in 2008 was a global event that changed the way\nemployees perceived jobs or \u201cwork.\u201d The freelance, start-up and gig economies\ntook off as people continued to lose their jobs. Data from such a critical\nhistorical event can help predict how the workforce may react to similar\nshifts in the future. It can then be used to identify trends in the current\nworkforce and predict voluntary and involuntary turnover.\n\n## **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n\nFor HR leaders keen to **get started with using HR analytics** for data-based\ndecision making, here are some tips:\n\n**![The complete HR analytics cycle](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The complete HR analytics cycle**\n\n### **I. Create a collective mindset**\n\n  \nBefore the operational and mathematical aspect can kick in, HR leaders must\nprepare their teams and organizations for a workflow-driven by analytics.\n\nWhile the discussion with the C-suite for the need for analytics is one part\nof the change, the other is preparing your team to deal with the amount of\ndata that they will now be using to measure the change.\n\nThis is a crucial aspect of **[HR\u2019s digital\ntransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)** as well as company-wide\ndigital transformation. Getting the team started on small projects and asking\nthem to create the reports that they will discuss with business leaders is a\ngood way to begin.\n\n### **II. Bring in data scientists**\n\n  \nThe data scientist is expected to become an integral part of HR teams. They\nare best suited to assess the viability of an analytics solution. They can\nalso ensure the robustness of the statistical modeling and predictions.\n\nAs Collins says, \u201cdata scientists will play an invaluable role in creating a\nculture of analytics across HR. As the role of HR business partners and\ngeneralists evolves to include skills such as data strategy, analysis, and\ncommunication (articulating \u2018the story behind the science\u2019), the data\nscientist will serve as the coach, mentoring their colleagues across HR in how\nto understand, and apply, the insights.\u201d\n\n### **III. Start small**\n\n  \nA great technique to convince stakeholders that HR analytics can drive\nbusiness value is to first implement a small project successfully. Called\n\u201cquick wins,\u201d these projects can deliver tangible results in a short amount of\ntime with high impact.\n\n### **IV. Get clearance from the legal team**\n\n  \nThe sort of data collection that HR analytics uses is governed heavily by\ncompliance laws. Some legal considerations to keep in mind when implementing\nan HR analytics solution are:\n\n  1. Employee privacy and anonymity\n  2. Consent from employees about the amount and type of data being collected\n  3. Establishing the goal of data collection and informing employees accordingly\n  4. IT security when using third-party software to run HR analytics\n  5. Location of the HR analytics vendor \u2013 with whom the data will be stored \u2013 and their compliance with local laws\n\n  \nCollaborate with the legal team of your organization to ensure ethics and\ncompliance norms are followed.\n\n### **V. Choose an HR analytics solution**\n\nAny HR analytics solution that will be used at scale must have certain\ncomponents.\n\n**![The key features of an HR analytics solution](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The key features of an HR analytics solution**\n\n**1\\. They answer the business questions the C-suite asks.** This may require\nthat you invest in a solution to address each question, leading to investments\nin multiple analytics solutions for granular data on each question.\nAlternatively, you may choose a unified solution that can assess multiple\nmetrics to answer each business question.\n\n**2\\. They are easy to use by individuals who are not data scientists.** An\naccessible solution created for laypersons is ideal when they want to assess\nany one or more metrics without interrupting the workflow of the data\nscientist.\n\n**3\\. They are cloud-based rather than on-premise.** A cloud-based solution\nalso aids accessibility without heavy IT integration. This grants HR the\nautonomy to use the solution as and when needed.\n\n**4\\. They are powered with statistical analysis and machine learning\ntechnology.** Big data platforms require advanced data management systems\npowered by machine learning and natural language processing. This allows the\ntechnology to learn and reason autonomously, revealing insights that data\nscientists can then analyze.\n\n**5\\. They are based on predictive analytics.** \u201c[Predictive analytics is] the\npractice of extracting information from existing data sets to determine\npatterns and forecast future outcomes. Analysts use statistical methods to\nforecast future alternatives \u2013 will the current termination rate continue at\nthe same pace or might we expect a surge of exits as the job market\nstrengthens?\u201d explains Collins.\n\n**6\\. They are powered with visualization technology.** A visual\nrepresentation of vast amounts of data can allow for better understanding of\ntrends and events. The complex data processed through an analytics engine\nrequires advanced visualization software, as it cannot be presented in simple\ncharts and presentations.\n\n**7\\. They are available through a subscription model.** Subscription models\nof software as a service (SaaS) platforms are useful because they easily allow\nyou to access the latest upgrades in technology. They also eliminate the\nsignificant upfront expense of purchasing an analytics solution and may be a\nmore cost-efficient way of investing in analytics.\n\n## **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\nHR analytics offers some undoubted benefits. It allows HR teams to\nsignificantly streamline processes that reduce costs, reduce attrition, and\nconsequently improve the bottom line.\n\nWith task automation, you are freed up to innovate and explore the human\naspect of human resources without spending time on tracking mountains of data\nfrom multiple sources.\n\nOverall, the use of HR analytics has been established as an HR technology\ntrend for 2019, as it is posed to improve the employee experience that\ndirectly translates into improved business outcomes.\n\nHowever, it also presents some real challenges.\n\nAs Collins tells us, \u201cWhile HR is ambitious about the use of predictive HR\nanalytics, two HR leaders I recently spoke with said \u2018we want to be able to\npredict everything!\u2019 The vision for how analytics will become an HR core\ncompetency is being constrained by limited consumption (insights being shared\nonly within the four walls of HR) and action (the research does not lead to a\nprogram change or new investment). There is still much progress to be made.\u201d\n\nIn addition, because data is siloed across the organization and conversations\nabout the goal of implementing analytics are unclear, the valuable data HR\nrequires for analytics is often underutilized.\n\nThe challenge is in waiting to actually see results. Predictive analytics is\nlikely to take a minimum of 24 months to show meaningful results, but it will\nhelp get started with HR transformation. So, the time to get started with HR\nanalytics is now.\n\nBy making a strong business case to key stakeholders, as an HR practitioner,\nyou can leverage the power of analytics to become a strategic business partner\nwho makes substantial contributions to the business.\n\n_Do you use HR analytics to capture critical data?

But, how do employers and HR staff ethically secure\nanalytics to make informed business decisions without invading the privacy of\ntheir employees, asks Andy Hames, Senior Vice President of Operations at\nPeople First.**_\n\nIt is no secret that data is valuable, leading to opportunities of discovery,\ninsight and informed decision-making. Data collection has become a dynamic\nasset in the working world especially, where people analytics is becoming an\nincreasingly important business strategy. In fact, according to a [recent\nDeloitte\nsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/human-\ncapital/deloitte-uk-human-capital-trends-2018.pdf), 85% of HR and business\nleaders considered people analytics to be an important or very important part\nof attracting and retaining staff, building a strong reputation and\ncultivating loyalty amongst customers.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPeople analytics refers to the method of collecting and analyzing information\nfrom employees that can help managers, HR staff and executives make better\ndecisions about business and workplace topics such as recruitment, talent\nmanagement, and workforce optimization. Before advancements in technology,\ncollecting insightful employee data was difficult. The end results were often\nstatistics rather than insights, limiting organizations\u2019 ability to understand\nand glean insights from the gathered information.\n\nNow, companies can obtain large amounts of data about their employees.\nHowever, this data collection can have its downfalls. The more information\nthat employers collect, the more questions are raised around the ethics of\ntracking employee behavior and security risks. To combat this, employers and\nHR teams must develop best practices for ethically collecting data to reap its\nbenefits in a positive way.\n\n## **Providing Insights**\n\nUntil recently, employers lacked the ability to dive deep into the information\ncollected from employees. Because of this, information \u2013 collected from\nsurveys, questionnaires and the like \u2013 was taken at face value, rather than\nanalyzed on a more granular level.\n\nNow, employers have the tools to efficiently dig deeper into employee data,\ndiscovering the trends and patterns that drive behaviors and outcomes.\nExamples of this include identifying which employees are at risk of leaving\ntheir position, which are ready for career progression and which are more\nlikely to fall victim to phishing campaigns.\n\nThis information allows the company to make better informed HR decisions,\nimproving productivity and employee engagement \u2013 two of the most critical\nissues facing employers today. With access to pragmatic people analytics,\ncompanies have a significant competitive advantage over organizations that\ndon\u2019t, with the ability to see what their employees may be lacking or looking\nfor without asking directly.\n\n## **Big Data or Big Brother?**\n\nThe promise of competitive advantage has led to an explosion in the amount of\nemployee data collected by businesses. But the appetite for data can be risky\nand raises ethical questions about how far companies should go to find\ninsights on employee behavior.\n\nFor example, in 2016, [employees at _The Daily\nTelegraph_](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/11/daily-telegraph-to-\nwithdraw-devices-monitoring-time-at-desk-after-criticism) were welcomed to\nwork with individual sensors at each of their desks to measure how much time\nwas spent at each one.\n\nThe publication told employees that the sensors were to collect environmental\nsustainability data, which could be analyzed to determine if office space was\nbeing used appropriately. The data could help the company decide if it should\nchange the size of its offices. _The Daily Telegraph_ staff was so outraged by\nthe sensors that they were removed by the end of the day.\n\nWhile collecting employee data is helpful, companies need to avoid taking it\ntoo far. Employees should not be coerced into certain behaviors through fear\nand wide-scale surveillance, like measuring how often an employee is sitting\nat their desk.\n\nRegardless of whether employers have good intentions about their methods of\ndata collection, respecting employee boundaries and protecting employees\u2019\nprivate information remains a priority. If not, businesses risk losing the\ntrust of their employees.\n\n**Learn More:[Does Your Organization Have Its Own People Analytics Team\nYet?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/does-your-\norganization-have-its-own-people-analytics-team-yet/)**\n\n## **Who is Making the Decisions?**\n\nWhile people analytics can provide unparalleled insights for organizations and\nHR staff, decisions should not be made based on data alone. No matter how\nsophisticated algorithms may be, they can\u2019t replace human intuition when it\ncomes to making the right, moral decision.\n\nOne example of the importance of human involvement in HR is in the recruitment\nprocess. While application testing tools and other algorithms can quickly\nanalyze resumes and job applications to filter and create a shortlist of job\ncandidates based on reported skills and experience, they are unable to\nquantify individual human characteristics and qualities as well as the\npotential for growth.\n\nRecruitment and many company decisions should always remain a human process.\nThe role of data analytics should be to assist and educate human decision-\nmaking processes \u2013 not replace them.\n\n## **Pragmatic People Analytics**\n\nIn the frenzy of data collection, some organizations lose sight of what they\nare trying to achieve in the first place. Collecting too much data and\nmeasuring everything just because a company can is often where employees feel\nintruded upon. People analytics should not be used to monitor employees\u2019 every\nmove, but as a way to improve the employee experience and continue to make the\nbusiness profitable. By being transparent about the information that they\u2019re\ntracking, companies will continue to retain the trust of their employees. With\ntrust, employees may be more willing to participate in data collection. To be\nsuccessful, people analytics should be a team effort from both the employee\nand the employer or HR team.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Address Internal Skills Gaps Through Talent Management to\nImprove Business\nOutcomes](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/how-to-address-internal-skills-gaps-through-talent-management-to-improve-\nbusiness-outcomes/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Ethically+Secure+People+Analytics\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Ethically+Secure+People+Analytics&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Ethically Secure People\nAnalytics&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-ethically-secure-people-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

Ten years ago, HR professionals only tracked a few statistics in\nspreadsheets. Today\u2019s HR and ER teams have come a long way, quickly learning\nhow to use data and analytics to drive actionable insights and position ER as\na strategic function.**_\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nHR and employee relations data are rich, detailed treasure troves of trends\nand guidance. Your organization can pinpoint questionable behavior by\ngeography, uncover best-practice workplace investigation patterns, drive\nstrategic C-level conversations and so much more.\n\nBut the sheer amount of data available from recruitment, performance\nmanagement and investigation interviews, and more, is daunting \u2013 even with\ntoday\u2019s technology and analytics to make sense of it.\n\nSo, how are today\u2019s HR and employee relations leaders addressing the\nchallenge?\n\nHere\u2019s advice you can apply in your organization.\n\n## **Collect and Connect Your Employee Data**\n\nMore than 150 global leaders offered their experiences in HR Acuity\u2019s [Tech &\nMetrics in Employee Relations Study](https://www.hracuity.com/benchmark-\nstudies/resources/tech-metrics-report).\n\nWe found that though many are capturing and tracking their employee data, most\ncompanies aren\u2019t yet fully integrating their employee data with their HR data.\nThough the trend is rapidly improving, the study also found that only 44 per\ncent of companies tie their employee relations data to their demographic\ninformation, and 40 per cent match it up against performance ratings, while 19\npercent don\u2019t integrate at all.\n\nThis is a missed opportunity. Your employee relations data holds untapped\npotential and tells a story of behavioral trends and insights. Combined with\nbusiness and organizational data, it can pinpoint real knowledge, like the\nconnections between poorly performing teams and business results.\n\n## **Drive Business Strategy**\n\nAccording to our research, 61 per cent of companies use their data to help\n[drive initiatives and gain\ninsights,](https://www.hracuity.com/blog/technology-data-metrics-employee-\nrelations-infographic) and 49 per cent use it to create better employee\nrelations policies. However, 27 per cent of companies report gathering the\ndata but aren\u2019t using it yet. That\u2019s a waste. Your data can allow you to see\nwho needs better training or which departments are working well, which can\naffect your organization\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThere\u2019s also the opportunity to improve strategic and upward collaboration\nwith data. As HR and ER departments become more integrated, sharing the\ninformation with decision-makers is a must. Today, only 22 per cent of\ncompanies report data to the board, though 59 per cent share it with the\nC-suite. Those numbers are going up, but in an ideal world, they would be at\n100 per cent. If HR wants to better demonstrate its value to the organization,\nwe need to not only gather data but use it and share how our efforts help the\nbusiness.\n\n## **Understand Employee Performance**\n\nHR and ER professionals are using data and analytics to understand employee\nperformance trends and apply them organization-wide. A heavy workload,\nstressors outside of the office, new management, training opportunities, and\nother factors - all contribute to an employee\u2019s success. Each factor is a data\npoint that can help identify outstanding performers and departments as well as\nthose who may be struggling.\n\nDoes one team have very low first-year turnover rates? It may be that the team\nmembers are highly-effective at training and on-boarding new employees, and\ntheir processes should be applied to other departments. However, if the\nmarketing and sales team report more workplace issues during the fall months,\na busy conference season could be the cause. Preparing ahead to bring on more\nresources during hectic months could result in a more productive team.\n\nEvent-based analytics is another way in which teams can customize reporting to\nlook for performance-based issues related to specific events (e.g. sales\nmeetings, off-site conferences and holidays). Being able to see whether\nincidents spike after a long holiday weekend or sales meeting allows you to\nmake decisions based on facts, rather than anecdotes.\n\n**Learn More:**[What Your Business Needs to Know About the Hourly Employee of\nTomorrow](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/expense-management/what-\nyour-business-needs-to-know-about-the-hourly-employee-of-tomorrow/)\n\n## **Track Employee Engagement**\n\nBy analyzing data from employee surveys, absence rates or reported employee\nissues, organizations can get a truer sense of employee engagement. In today\u2019s\nage of employee experience and transparency, employees want to know what\u2019s\ngoing on and expect positive workplace cultures. This insight can indicate\nwhat policies and processes are having a positive influence on staff\nperformance and morale.\n\nOn the flip side, understanding what\u2019s not working is just as important. Are\nthere policies that continue to be violated? Reporting and analytics can help\nidentify where a company\u2019s own practices aren\u2019t working and when guidelines\nand training programs need to be re-drafted.\n\n## **Conduct Best-Practice Investigations and Manage ER Cases**\n\nEmployee relations workloads are heavy; nearly one-third of ER professionals\njuggle more than 26 issues at any given time, and 49% of those who conduct\ninvestigations average seven or more open investigations at one time.\nAnalytics can help identify where the blockages are. For example, using\nanalytics can measure case count and closure rates, monitor productivity and\nidentify when a team member needs help.\n\nAnalysis also helps drive consistency and prepare ER teams on how to approach\ninvestigations based on historical data. Teams can analyze the data from other\nsimilar cases to see the actions taken and apply the learnings to their\ncurrent cases. When processes are based on data-driven insights, it sets the\nexpectation that all cases must be documented so it can be tracked and used\neffectively.\n\n## **Improve Employee Retention**\n\nSome **o** rganizations are using analytics to dig deeper into what\u2019s\nimpacting retention through exit interviews. Does length of service have an\nimpact or are external factors at play? Perhaps the compensation package is no\nlonger competitive. They\u2019re also using insights to build strategies for\nreducing turnover in the critical first year of employment.\n\nWe are also seeing a growing focus on transparency, with [Microsoft\nrecently](https://qz.com/work/1595743/microsoft-is-overhauling-how-it-\ninvestigates-hr-investigations/) announcing an overhaul of its HR processes\namid allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Data can help\norganizations achieve much-needed transparency, enabling them to track,\nanalyze and document the issues that matter most to them and their employees.\nThis not only extends to workplace investigations but can also help\ndemonstrate a commitment to providing equal pay or employing a diverse\nworkforce.\n\n## **Predict What\u2019s Next**\n\nLooking ahead, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence are very much\non the minds of HR and ER leaders, though at this point, they appear to be\nlargely still a promise. Currently, two-thirds of leaders do not yet have\nplans to implement predictive analytics, though they are working towards it.\n\nIn the words of one enterprise HR leader, \u201cIt\u2019s on the roadmap. We are in a\nphased approach, starting with our foundational systems, to track case\nactivity and understand the descriptive statistics that describe the trends.\nOur next step will be to integrate with other sources and apply machine\nlearning technology to predict employee behavior.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that data and analytics are part of the strategy of every\nforward-looking HR team. We must get the basics right, only then the real\ninsights will follow. Assess your current state, identify what you want to\nknow, collaborate with senior leaders to formulate your requirements, focus on\noutcomes, think outside HR \u2013 and think big. You have what you need. Unlock the\nvalue.\n\n**Learn More:**[7 Experts on Talent Engagement for a Multigenerational\nWorkforce](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/7-experts-on-talent-engagement-for-a-multigenerational-workforce/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-get-the-most-from-yourhrdata-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Get+the+Most+from+Your%C2%A0HR%C2%A0Data+%26+Analytics\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Get+the+Most+from+Your%C2%A0HR%C2%A0Data+%26+Analytics&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-get-the-most-from-yourhrdata-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-get-the-most-from-yourhrdata-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-get-the-most-from-yourhrdata-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Get the Most from Your\u00a0HR\u00a0Data &\nAnalytics&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fhow-to-get-the-most-from-yourhrdata-\nanalytics%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

There\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about the\nvirus, but we have some idea of how to curtail its spread. That\u2019s why the most\nessential step for HR leaders today is to empower employees in times of crisis\nand create robust business continuity plans. **_\n\nWhile medical experts and WHO are sharing timely updates on public health best\npractices, we spoke to 11 industry leaders who share tips on [how HR can\ncommunicate with employees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\ncompliance/coronavirus-hr-communication/) during a pandemic.\n\nHere\u2019s what companies, managers, and CHROs can do to make sense of and lead\nemployees through an uncertain situation:\n\n## **1\\. Build Day-to-Day Habits Around Good Hygiene and Limit Travel**\n\n[**Jennifer Dennard**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-dennard-822b0616/)\n**, COO, and co-founder,**[ **Range**](http://www.range.co)\n\n\u201cAs HR leaders, we play a critical role in business continuity helping teams\nunderstand risks, implementing practices to reduce them, and ensuring\noperations can continue as seamlessly as possible. For the coronavirus, we\u2019ve\nworked to define policies, resources, and sound practices, and we\u2019ve\ncommunicated them, with transparent, regular updates from leadership. These\npractices take practice, so we\u2019ve been building day-to-day habits around good\nhygiene, limiting travel, now. Because our product helps remote teams stay in\nsync and strengthen connections, we all know how to work from home because we\ndo it at least one day a week. Consider providing specific guidance for how\nteams and leaders can operate effectively when working remotely. Create a\ndocument detailing how teams should adjust their operations and try having\neveryone work remotely one day a week to develop the operating model. Build\nthe practice now to avoid painful fire drills later.\u201d\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\"Frequent communication and simple guidance to help employees protect\nthemselves: Reminders on how to conduct oneself when sneezing or coughing:\nbest in a tissue and then discarding or into an elbow. NOT coughing or\nsneezing in hand as employees tend to forget to wash hands and then touch\ndoorknobs, copiers, etc., potentially infecting others. Washrooms stocked with\nhand sanitizers, paper towels, and soap.\u201d\n\n## **2\\. Leverage Remote Work to Continue Business as Usual**\n\n[**Alex Konanykhin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konanykhin/) **, CEO,**[\n**TransparentBusiness**](http://TransparentBusiness.com)\n\n\"HR has to be prepared to assure the smooth transition of the workforce to the\nwork-from-home scenario, should the pandemic make a daily commute to usual\nworkplaces impossible or unadvisable.\n\n\u201cMillions of people in China are banned from commuting to work. Remote work\nthere is no longer a matter of convenience or economic efficiency; it\u2019s\nliterally a matter of life and death. Unnecessary commute and congregating in\noffice buildings increase the rate of spread of the decease. However, managing\nremote workers blindly is notoriously inefficient, so HR must train their\nworkforce to use transparency solutions, which have become an essential\nelement of emergency preparedness and continuity of business.\u201d\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n**\u201cLeverage working from home:** Unlike many businesses, tech companies can\noperate using remote employees, so this is an excellent time to draw on this\ncapability. Ensure all employees are equipped to work from home and have met\nthe correct safety criteria to do so. This will show employees you support\nthem in their concerns about public transport travel and the closure of school\nand daycares and allows those who have been exposed to the virus, but aren\u2019t\nunwell, to work while in self-quarantine.\u201d\n\n**Learn more:**[ **6 Essential Remote Work Tools HR Needs to Deploy for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/6-essential-\nremote-work-tools-hr-needs-to-deploy-for-2020/)\n\n**[Courtney Bigony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtneybigony/), director of\npeople science, [15Five](http://15five.com)**\n\n\u201cIt's HR's responsibility to leverage flexible work plans and not only allow\nbut encourage employees who may feel sick to work from home and take time off\nwithout retaliation or punishment. If you don't already have a flexible work\nfrom home policy, now is the time to create one. It's HR's responsibility to\nmake it as easy as possible for employees to stay home at the early signs of\nsickness without fear. In short, put in place structures that make it easy for\npeople to do the right thing. If you have these structures in place, then when\nsomething like Coronavirus hits, then moving remote shouldn\u2019t affect business\nas usual.\u201d\n\n[**Ben Christensen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmchrist/) **, head of\npeople and talent,**[ **Handshake**](http://www.joinhandshake.com)\n\n\u201c1) If at all feasible, ask your employees to work from home. Social\ndistancing being put in place as early as possible can be key for helping slow\ndown the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201c2) Make sure your managers are set up for success in managing teams remotely,\nand you have a support system to make sure you\u2019re checking in on employees to\nmake sure they\u2019re safe and healthy. This is a quick guide we made for our\nmanagers when we made the choice to move to WFH and a guide we made for\nindividuals on expectations and best practices when working from home.\n\n\u201c3) There\u2019s a lot of information, uncertainty, and confusion. HR can play a\nkey role in helping employees make sense of all the information, and what this\nmeans for them and their family, leading to a happier, more comfortable, and\nsafe team. We are sending daily updates to our team letting them know about\nany changes to our policies or any other noteworthy news they may want to be\naware of.\n\n\u201c4) Take a look at what other companies are doing and build off the great work\nthat others have done. You don\u2019t need to figure it all out on your own.\u201d\n\n## **3\\.

Pandemics and disasters massively affect people \u2013 HR\nis central to the planning and handling of these types of events. HR must\nbalance the needs of people with the need to keep business operations running.\n\n**\u201cTask 1** is to identify where people are and how likely they are to be\nexposed to and/ or impacted by the event.\n\n**\u201cTask 2** is to identify the work that is being done by this group and\ndetermine if it can be paused, re-located or continued with different\nenvironmental controls in place.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of our foodservice clients has already re-organized their\nshift structure and allocation of employees to reduce the risks to their\npeople.\n\n**\u201cTask 3** is to set, communicate and manage policy and work expectations for\nthe broader employee base.

Validating the needs of others protects resources that may be\ntough to quantify but priceless to your firm: loyalty, motivation, and\ncourage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also vital for employees at all levels to make sure that the messages\nthey are conveying and the actions they are taking are aligned as this crisis\nunfolds. Whenever we proffer a strategic plan, it\u2019s imperative to be able to\nexecute this in a manner that models an approach to problem-solving that\nsupports the firm\u2019s culture.\"\n\n## **5.** **Communication Must be Swift, Clear, and Supportive**\n\n[**Henry Albrecht**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryalbrecht/) **, CEO, and\nfounder,**[ **Limeade**](https://www.limeade.com)\n\n\"Now is the time your people need you the most.

Here are three things\nemployers can do right now to protect their workforce:\n\n**\u201cDynamic Communication:** Email is not useful in situations like this as not\nevery employee has access, and email does not open opportunities for two-way\ncommunication for all. Ensure your company has a bidirectional engagement\nsolution to communicate proactively and to help you react to feedback.\nAdminister small surveys frequently to gauge how your employees are feeling\nand identify shifts in attitude, so you can adjust accordingly.\n\n**\u201cShow Care:** Your employees should hear from you often, feel supported and\ncared for, and the overarching message must be crystal clear: stay home if you\nare sick; know the travel policies; employees have a right to protect\nthemselves and their teams from spreading illnesses.\n\n**\u201cAddress Policies:** Develop corporate policies to proactively address the\nspread of viruses. Your workforce must know what the company is doing, how\nyou\u2019re doing it, and when, in order to feel confident that any scenario has\nbeen accounted for, which will increase feelings of safety.\"\n\n[**Kandi Gongora**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kandigongora/) **, VP people,\nand organizational excellence,**[ **Goodway\nGroup**](https://www.goodwaygroup.com)  \n  \n\"You must communicate that you are monitoring the situation while also\neducating employees on how to protect themselves at home and at work. If you\ndon\u2019t allow remote work, this is the best time to test and work out any issues\nbefore the virus spreads. It isn\u2019t easy and there will be challenges. You will\nneed to monitor its effectiveness and the overall wellbeing of employees. This\nrequires planning and thoughtfulness, but if everyone keeps an open mind you\ncan keep employees safe and productive and come away with learnings on how to\ncontinue to provide flexible working environments.\"\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n\"HR\u2019s role is like that of any other business leader: understand the business\nimpact in all the regions you operate in; and communicate, educate and put the\ncorrect protective measures in place. HR leaders should understand the supply\nchain: Where are all your employees located and how are they affected? Tech is\nknown to outsource certain parts of their software development, so it\u2019s\nimportant to understand how those countries are handling the virus.\n\n**\u201cCreate safe and open dialogue:** If employees feel they may be vilified for\nbringing the virus into the office, they are unlikely to disclose they are\nunwell or have been exposed. Communicate common myths about the virus and\nexplain when and how they should notify their workplace. Reinforce that there\nwill be no repercussions for coming forward and their privacy will be treated\nwith the upmost respect. It is also critical to train front line managers on\nthe company\u2019s approach and what questions to ask their team.\n\n**\u201cHave a plan in the event of an office outbreak:** Consider how you will\ncommunicate the outbreak, including details like when employees will need to\nuse PTO and when to work from home. Be clear on strategic actions like whether\nyou\u2019ll separate the executive team and whether you can outsource area of work\nif a team that is key to the business becomes unwell.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Low-Cost, High-Impact Internal Communication Tools for\nSmall Businesses**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/3-lowcost-highimpact-internal-communication-tools-for-small-\nbusinesses/)\n\n## **6.** **Make it Easy for Employees to Ask Questions via an Open-Door\nPolicy**\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\u201cCreate a website or webpage on corporate website with FAQs that is updated\nabout the coronavirus or any other crisis employees are facing or worried\nabout. Frequent updates are key.\n\n\u201cAllowing employees to stay at home and/or work from home when they are not\ncomfortable at work or feeling ill. Make it easy to ask.\n\n\u201cRemember that uncertainty and fear are productivity killers, so have an open-\ndoor policy and make it easy for employees to ask questions that cannot be\nanswered on the FAQ webpage. The more forthcoming HR departments are with\ninformation, support in helping employees practice hygiene and safety, and the\nmore they can create an environment of transparency, the more employees will\nbe able to focus on the job during the chaos.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HR\u2019s Critical Role in Emergency\nCommunications**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/hrs-critical-role-in-emergency-communications/)\n\n## **7.** **CHROs Must Provide Meaningful Input for Business Continuity\nPlanning**\n\n[**Umesh\nRamakrishnan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umeshceokingsleygatepartners/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Kingsley Gate Partners**](http://www.kingsleygate.com)\n\n\u201cIn a health-based crisis, like the coronavirus pandemic, HR plays a\nsignificant role both in risk mitigation and operational control. As the world\nknows now, the most vulnerable populations are ones that have underlying\nconditions \u2013 conditions that are protected from disclosure due to privacy\nlaws. The only ones with access to that information are HR executives. They\nshould use this to direct leadership teams with resource allocation, location\ndecisions, and sick leave policy adjustments. In addition, they should lean\ninto modifying compensation structures temporarily to protect their employees\nin the long term. CEOs should depend on their CHROs to provide meaningful\ninput into business continuity planning and risk mitigation. They should also\nset up a communication channel with remote employees that have not had\nexperience working in such a manner to ensure that morale is kept up during\nthis trying time.

The key word, I\nthought, was _potential_. Not anymore. A recent global survey on which I\ncollaborated with Oracle suggests that HR is right up there with the most\nanalytical functions in business \u2014 and even a bit ahead of a quantitatively-\noriented function like Finance. Many HR departments are making use of advanced\nanalytical methods like predictive and prescriptive models, and even\nartificial intelligence.\n\nThis is a big change from a decade ago, when I began to study the use of\ntalent analytics. (Jeanne Harris, Jeremy Shapiro, and I published an [article\nin HBR](/2010/10/competing-on-talent-analytics) on the subject in 2010). At\nthat time, the only really sophisticated HR analytics capability we uncovered\nwas at Google and perhaps Harrah\u2019s (now Caesars). There was a fair amount of\nreporting going on, but not much prediction. Few HR organizations even had a\ndedicated analytics person. \u201cHR analytics\u201d typically meant a debate about how\nmany employees the organization had, or the best way to measure employee\nengagement.\n\nEven before the new survey results came out, I suspected that things were very\ndifferent today. Most large companies have at least a small people, talent,\nworkforce, or HR analytics group. There are many conferences devoted to the\ntopic. It\u2019s very common for organizations today to model workforce growth,\nattrition, engagement, and other key variables.\n\nThe survey involved 1,510 respondents from 23 countries across five\ncontinents. It included senior managers, directors, and VPs from from HR\n(61%), the Finance function (28%), and general management (10%). I was hired\nto help design, analyze, and report on the survey. All of the executives were\nfrom companies with $100M in revenue or more. Detailed results are\n[here](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/hr-analytics-report-ipaper.pdf).\n\nWhile it\u2019s obvious that HR is moving in an analytical direction,  I did not\nexpect the very high level of sophisticated analytical activity in the survey.\nHere are some highlights:\n\n  * 51% of HR respondents said that they could perform predictive or prescriptive analytics, whereas only 37% of Finance respondents could undertake these more advanced forms of analytics.\n  * 89% agreed or agreed strongly that \u201cMy HR function is highly skilled at using data to determine future workforce plans currently (e.g. talent needed),\u201d and only 1% disagreed.\n  * 94% agreed that \u201cWe are able to predict the likelihood of turnover in critical roles with a high degree of confidence currently.\u201d\n  * 94% also agreed that, \u201cWe have accurate, real-time insight into our employees\u2019 career development goals currently.\u201d\n  * When asked \u201cWhich of the following analytics are you using?\u201d \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d received the highest response, with 31%. When asked for further detail on how respondents were using AI, the most common responses were \u201cidentifying at-risk talent through attrition modeling,\u201d \u201cpredicting high-performing recruits,\u201d and \u201csourcing best-fit candidates with resume analysis.\u201d\n\nThis level of self-assessed capability for HR analytics was high in almost\nevery geography and every specific question, but it was somewhat lower in\nAsian, European, and Australian organizations. It was generally highest in the\nU.S., the Middle East, and Latin America. Across industries, it was lowest in\nthe \u201chospitality, travel, and leisure\u201d and \u201cmedia and entertainment\u201d\ncategories. Particularly high industries included financial services, energy\nand utilities, professional services, and wholesale distribution.\n\nWhy is HR more comfortable with advanced analytics than Finance, which has\nalways been a function based on numbers? I have noted for years that Finance\norganizations and the CFOs who lead them have found it difficult to move past\ndescriptive analytics and reporting \u2014 which they do very well \u2014 to more\nadvanced analytics. There are certainly exceptions to this rule, but it helps\nexplain why the growth of advanced analytics has been faster in HR.\n\nBut no function in a business stands alone with regard to data and analytics.\nOne reason that Oracle surveyed both HR and Finance executives is that those\ntwo functions have an increasing need to collaborate. Workforce expenditures\nare often among an organization\u2019s highest costs, and a company\u2019s financial\nsituation will dictate fluctuations in the size and makeup of the workforce.\nThe survey found high levels of collaboration and mutual respect between HR\nand Finance, and a growing need for collaboration. For example, 82% of\nrespondents agreed or strongly agreed, and only 5% disagreed, that\n\u201cIntegrating HR and Finance data is a top priority for us this year.\u201d However,\nseveral interviews conducted after the survey revealed that there is still\nmuch opportunity for greater sharing of data and collaboration on analytics.\n\nOf course, not everything is rosy in the world of HR analytics. I was quite\ninterested to see that the function\u2019s use of analytical tools surpasses the\nability to interpret and act on them. When respondents were asked about the\narea of \u201cmost needed to develop or improve\u201d analytical skills for HR, the\nhighest-ranking choice was \u201cacting on data and analytics to solve issues.\u201d\n\u201cCultivating quantitative analysis and reasoning skills\u201d and \u201cadvising\nbusiness leaders by telling a story with data\u201d also ranked highly. My\nexperience is that these skills are equally lacking in other functions.\nPerhaps it is another sign of HR\u2019s analytical maturity that it is facing the\nsame human skill shortages that have long bedeviled analytics users across\ncompanies.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2013/09/110-tom-davenport.jpg)\n\n[Thomas H.

Integrated Benefits Institute finds the staggering cost of\nsick leave and short-term disability as a result of the pandemic.\n\nBy: [Kathryn Mayer](https://hrexecutive.com/author/kathryn-mayer/

from work due to COVID-19 could cost employers more than $23 billion\nin benefits for absent workers, impacting up to 5.6 million employees, new\nresearch finds.\n\nThe staggering figure comes from the Integrated Benefits Institute, which\nassessed potential sick leave wages, short-term disability payments and\nspending on employee benefits for absent workers. IBI used employment, wage\nand leave benefit data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and lost workday\nexperiences contained in IBI\u2019s dataset of employer-sponsored STD claims to\nmodel lost work time impacts for low-, mid- and high-range scenarios depending\non the total COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\nIn terms of the costs of COVID-19 absences, \u201cwhat we might see play out are\nthe implications of employers\u2019 decisions about emphasizing care management and\nsupport for healthy lifestyles as part of their overall benefits strategies,\u201d\nsays Brian Gifford, research and analytics director for IBI. \u201cThat could turn\nout to be important not only for leave payments, but for some people the\ndifference between whether or not they needed scarce resources such as\nventilators in order to pull through. We may not know the answer to that until\nwe are able to get a look at employees from different companies with different\nbenefits policies and see how they fared during and after the pandemic.\u201d\n\n[**Read all of _HRE_ \u2019s coronavirus coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)\n\nUp to 5.6 million employees could be impacted by coronavirus-related leave,\nIBI notes, with nearly 3 million workers at firms with fewer than 500\nemployees entitled to paid leave per the Families First Coronavirus Response\nAct that went into effect April 1.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things to keep in mind is that this analysis\nassumes a pretty low rate of very serious, ICU cases\u2014about 8% of the total.\nThat keeps absence durations relatively short,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cBut at least\nfor younger workers, those serious cases are driven by complications such as\ncardiovascular conditions and diabetes\u2014things that unfortunately are not\nuncommon in the workforce, and which impose productivity burdens under the\nbest of circumstances.\u201d\n\nIBI\u2019s analysis follows other research that indicates the significant cost\nCOVID-19 is having on benefits. [Willis Towers\nWatson](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/), for instance, recently found that\nemployer healthcare costs could increase up to 7% this year due to coronavirus\ntreatment and testing costs\u2014on top of the 5% increase companies had already\nprojected before the pandemic. That analysis finds that a 30% infection rate\ncould increase medical and prescription drug costs between 4% and 7%,\ndepending on how sick COVID-19 patients become.\n\n**Related:** [Here\u2019s how much employer healthcare costs could increase due to\ncoronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-much-employer-healthcare-costs-\ncould-increase-due-to-coronavirus/)\n\n\u201cDespite employers and employees taking the right precautions at this perilous\ntime, the coronavirus continues to spread and place enormous pressure on our\nnation\u2019s healthcare system,\u201d says Trevis Parson, chief actuary at Willis\nTowers Watson. \u201cThis spike in the demand for care is likely to lead to a\nsignificant jump in employer healthcare costs beyond previous expectations.\u201d\n\nGifford adds that the best benefits cost control strategy for employers is\n\u201cminimizing exposure to infections by enforcing social distance policies where\npossible and operating safely when the work has to continue for essential\nservices.\u201d\n\nKathryn Mayer is _HRE_ \u2019s benefits editor and chair of the Health & Benefits\nLeadership Conference. She has covered benefits for the better part of a\ndecade, and her stories have won multiple awards, including a Jesse H. Neal\nAward and honors from the American Society of Business Publication Editors and\nthe National Federation of Press Women.

Data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/insights/big-data/)\n[COVID-19](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/covid-19/)\n[Healthcare](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/healthcare/) [Latest\nNews](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\nby [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/ \"Posts by\nVivek Kumar\") [March 13, 2020](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2020/03/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/big-data-effective-response-\ncoronavirus-outbreak/#comments)\n\n![Big Data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wuhan-\nbig-data.jpg)\n\nGlobally, the coronavirus outbreak now has hit millions of lives with\nthousands of deaths across the world. And the rising threat of this virus\ncontinues increasing as everyday new cases are coming out. However, countries\naffected with coronavirus are now taking major steps to address it using AI\nand big data technologies. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),\nAI and [big data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/how-big-data-analytics-are-\ntransforming-the-global-gambling-industry/) played a significant role in\nChina\u2019s response to COVID-19, new name of coronavirus.\n\nTaiwan is using big data to contain the spread of coronavirus. Due to its\nproximity to China, Taiwan could have hit hard by the Covid-19. It is said\nthat over 400,000 of its citizens work in mainland China. However, the\ncountry\u2019s use of big data analytics and cellphone tracking assisted officials\nto control the spread of the virus, according to the Journal of the American\nMedical Association (JAMA).\n\nShanghai is also leveraging big data to minimize further risk of the\ncoronavirus spreading. Reportedly, workers in Shanghai report their\ntemperature, travel history, and other information, which then sent to a big\ndata platform that authorities use to manage epidemic prevention.\n\nIn a statement, Director of Data Department of Shanghai Municipal Public\nSecurity Bureau, Shen Yuxin said \"We can see the personnel inflow and movement\nclearly and know where they stay in the city, especially those who come from\nthe epicenters. So, we can take measures in some targeted districts and\ncommunities to prevent the virus from spreading.\" Shanghai\u2019s cross-department\ndata platform integrates information collected from police, health authorities\nand other government departments. This will then use to alert local community\nworkers to take action if anything warrants it.\n\n\n\n#### **Identifying the Early Signs of Virus Outbreak with Big Data**\n\nIn 2014, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) predicted up to 1.4 million\ncases infected from the Ebola outbreak. Then, it was said that what could big\ndata do to help identify the earlier signs of future outbreaks? That time,\nHarvard\u2019s HealthMap service made headlines for monitoring early mentions of\nthe Ebola outbreak nine days before the WHO officially announced the epidemic,\nand issuing its first alert.\n\nReports suggest that the HealthMap\u2019s early warning came from using massive\ncomputing power to sift out early indicators from millions of social media\nposts and other media platforms. But an\n[article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/26/why-big-data-missed-the-early-\nwarning-signs-of-ebola/) published on FP, \u201cWhy Big Data Missed the Early\nWarning Signs of Ebola\u201d, mentioned that by the time HealthMap monitored its\nvery first report, the Guinean government had already announced the outbreak\nand notified the WHO.\n\nNow, in the case of coronavirus outbreak, On December 30, 2019, a Toronto-\nbased startup BlueDot that uses a platform built around AI, machine learning\nand big data to track and envisage the outbreak and spread of infectious\ndiseases, alerted its private sector and government clients about a cluster of\nunusual pneumonia cases happening around a market in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn this case, some reports earlier claimed 27 pneumonia cases associated with\na market that had seafood and live animals in Wuhan. And the cities BlueDot\nidentified was correct that were highly connected to Wuhan using things like\nglobal airline ticketing data to help anticipate where the infected might be\ntraveling. The international destinations that BlueDot anticipated would have\nthe highest volume of travelers from Wuhan were: Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo,\nTaipei, Phuket, Seoul, and Singapore, according to an\n[article](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/03/why-big-data-missed-early-\nwarning-signs-of-covid-19/). In the end, 11 of the cities at the top of their\nlist were the first places to see COVID-19 cases.\n\nBut looking at the infection rate\n[graph](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-\ndie-f4d3d9cd99ca), the 11 cities Blue Dot listed are near to flat on the\nbottom, and countries like South Korea, France, Germany and the US are\nclimbing upwards. There are many cases in South Korea but the author asks why\nJapan, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand or Hong Kong haven\u2019t? and said all of them\nwere hit by SARS in 2003, and all of them learned from it.\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/big-\ndata-effective-response-coronavirus-outbreak/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/big-\ndata-effective-response-coronavirus-outbreak/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/big-\ndata-effective-response-coronavirus-outbreak/&title=Is Big Data Effective in\nResponse to Coronavirus Outbreak?)

But when data\nbecomes a core asset, the need for careful data governance becomes even more\npressing.\n\n![What Are The Pitfalls Of People Analytics And Data-Driven HR?\n](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e438d95a854780006b11117/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nWhat Are The Pitfalls Of People Analytics And Data-Driven HR?\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nToday\u2019s HR teams potentially have access to huge amounts of data, and this can\nbring great rewards for those who use that data intelligently. But, data also\nbrings its own unique challenges. Therefore, before implementing any data-\ndriven HR approach, it\u2019s important to consider the potential pitfalls that\nsurround employee-related data, particularly when it comes to their personal\ndata.\n\n**Data privacy**\n\nObviously, HR teams need to operate within the data privacy laws of their\ncountry. Here in the UK, unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019ll know\nthat personal employee data comes under GDPR \u2013 General Data Protection\nRegulation \u2013 which comes into effect in May 2018. I talk more about this in my\narticle \u2018[ _What GDPR means for HR teams_\n\u2019](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1430\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1430\"), but suffice to say\nthat GDPR will impact the way HR teams gather, store and work with employee\ndata.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about GDPR is how it cracks down on companies that take a\nlaissez-faire approach to data privacy. Companies that fail to properly\nprotect employees\u2019 personal data, or are found to be misusing personal data,\nface stiff fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual worldwide turnover,\nwhichever is the greater of the two.\n\nToday In: [Enterprise Tech](https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n### This Emergency Communications Startup Just Raised $15 Million Amid A\nCOVID-19 Boom\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/04/07/this-emergency-\ncommunications-startup-just-raised-15-million-amid-a-covid-19-boom/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Google Starts To Publish Coronavirus Mobility Reports\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2020/04/07/google-starts-to-\npublish-coronavirus-mobility-reports/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Is \u2018Management By Walking Around\u2019 Still Possible When Everything Is\nDigital And Remote?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2020/04/06/is-management-by-\nwalking-around-still-possible-when-everything-is-digital-and-remote/)\n\n **Protecting against data breaches**\n\nAmidst this harsher regulatory landscape (not to mention the reputational\nfallout of high-profile data breaches), HR data must be properly secured and\nprotected from threats. If you think that no one would be interested in\nstealing your employee-related data (as opposed to, say, customer credit card\ndetails), think again. It may surprise you to know that [medical data is 10\ntimes more valuable to criminals than credit card\ndata](https://cyberpolicy.com/cybersecurity-education/why-medical-records-\nare-10-times-more-valuable-than-credit-card-info\n\"https://cyberpolicy.com/cybersecurity-education/why-medical-records-\nare-10-times-more-valuable-than-credit-card-info\"). So the lesson is: if it\ncontains personally identifiable information, data of any kind can be\nvaluable.\n\nBut hoodied criminal hackers trading data on the dark web aren\u2019t the only\nsource of data breaches. The insider threat (whether malicious or through\nsheer ineptitude) is huge. In one example, a Boeing employee [inadvertently\ncaused a breach that might have exposed the personal data of 36,000 Boeing\nemployees](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/technology/pages/boeing-insider-data-breach-serves-as-reminder-for-\nhr.aspx \"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/technology/pages/boeing-insider-data-breach-serves-as-reminder-for-\nhr.aspx\"), including their names, date of births, and social security numbers.\nHow? The unlucky employee was having trouble formatting a spreadsheet, so he\nsent it on to his spouse for help, unaware that the spreadsheet contained\nhidden columns with confidential information.\n\nIn another example, a disgruntled employee of British supermarket Morrisons\n[deliberately exposed colleagues\u2019 personal data\nonline](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/morrisons-liable-\nstaff-data-leak-landmark-decision\n\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/morrisons-liable-staff-data-\nleak-landmark-decision\"). In a landmark High Court case, the supermarket was\nfound liable for the breach. Just imagine the consequences of such a breach\nwhen GDPR is in effect. The damage to a business\u2019s finances and reputation\ncould be catastrophic.\n\n**Understanding the ethical pitfalls**\n\nAs well as sitting on the right side of the law, HR teams also need to ensure\ntheir data usage sits within the company\u2019s ethical boundaries. Most companies\nthese days emphasize a culture of openness and honesty. If your data-driven HR\nactivities fly in the face of that culture \u2013 for example, by clumsily\nimplementing data projects or poorly communicating how data is used \u2013 it could\nlead to massive morale and trust issues.\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the key pieces of advice I give to businesses is this:\n_transparency_. Transparency around what employee data is being collected,\ntransparency around why it\u2019s being collected, and transparency around how it\nwill be used.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to add value for employees and emphasize the positive\noutcomes of using their data. People are far happier for their data to be used\nwhen they feel they\u2019re getting something valuable in return, whether it\u2019s\nbetter working conditions, more effective management, a safer environment, or\nwhatever.\n\n**The importance of good governance**\n\nPracticing good data governance will help ensure your HR data remains a\nvaluable asset and doesn't turn into a liability. Here\u2019s a snapshot of what\ngood data governance means in practice:\n\n\u00b7         **Create data governance procedures (if you haven\u2019t already).** This\nmay include defining who owns the various people-related data within the\norganization, who is responsible for data accuracy, who is responsible for\ncontrolling access to the data, and who is responsible for updating the data.\nIt should also cover how the data can be used.\n\n\u00b7         **Get consent for employee data.** Consent is a critical pillar of\ndata privacy. This means HR must get employees\u2019 express permission in order to\ncollect and process their personal data. It used to be that consent was\nassumed as part and parcel of employment. Thanks to GDPR, that\u2019s no longer the\ncase.\n\n\u00b7         **Be strict about data usage.** GDPR means you can only use personal\ndata for the specific purpose for which consent was given. If you want to use\nthe data for a different purpose, new permission is needed. It\u2019s vital HR\ncolleagues fully understand this, as the fines for misusing data can be\nenormous.\n\n\u00b7         **Practice data minimization.** This means gathering only the very\nessential data, i.e., data that can help meaningfully improve the company and\nadd value. Data for data\u2019s sake is worthless, and can actually prove\ndetrimental to the company in the long run.\n\n\u00b7         **Anonymise data.** Wherever possible, you should anonymize personal\nemployee data, which means stripping it of any personal markers that link an\nindividual to that piece of information.\n\n\u00b7         **Protect and secure your data.** There are certain safeguards any\nbusiness can put in place to secure data and prevent breaches. Such measures\ncan include encrypting data, having systems in place to detect and stop\nbreaches while they\u2019re happening, and training staff so they never give away\nsecure information.\n\n  \n\nRead more about how HR teams can get the most out of data and analytics,\nwithout falling foul of the pitfalls, in my book [_Data-Driven\nHR_](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\n\"https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1410\") _._ It\u2019s packed with\nreal-life examples and practical ways HR teams can deliver maximum value in\nour increasingly data-driven world.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@bernardmarr) or\n[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr).

how-to on getting a talent analytics function\nup and running.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | October 2, 2019 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HR-\nTechnology-1170-hall-way-crowd-on-day-one-700x385.jpg)\n\nCrowds move around during the HR Technology Conference at the Venetian in Las\nVegas. (Photo by Isaac Brekken for Human Resource Executive)\n\nHR analytics is far from a glamorous job, said Lydia Wu, head of talent\nanalytics at Panasonic North America.\n\n\"My daily job is to untangle hot messes in the organization,\" she said with a\nlaugh.\n\nWu, who spoke on Wednesday at the HR Tech Conference in Las Vegas, shared her\nlessons learned on establishing an HR analytics function at a mid-sized\norganization.\n\n[**READ MORE: Follow along for full conference coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)\n\n\"When I joined Panasonic a year and a half ago, I was a one-woman HR analytics\nteam,\" said Wu, whose background is in consulting.\n\nAt Panasonic North America, the analytics function that she created was able\nto eventually do deep dives into issues such as turnover among millennials,\nemployee engagement and exit-interview processes. Thanks to these efforts, the\ncompany has new insights that it's using to enhance its talent solutions.\n\nBefore all this could happen, however, Wu had to first build support and\nrecognition for talent analytics within the organization.\n\n\"Everyone talks about how great talent analytics is,\" she said. \"But no one\never seems to talk about how to actually get started.\"\n\n[**SUBSCRIBE here to receive our daily\nemails.**](https://hrexecutive.com/home-page/subscribe/)\n\nWu based her strategy on a framework of five components: data, customers,\ntools, people and \"you.\"\n\nWith Data, the first step is to recognize that \"everyone suffers from data\nissues. It's not just you, so don't feel overwhelmed,\" she said.\n\nThe next step, she said, is to \"start from anywhere.\"\n\n\"Once you pick up on a problem, you then ask what's causing the problem and\nwhat it's affecting. Along the way, you'll encounter stakeholders in the\norganization who can help you solve the problem.\"\n\nThe third step, said Wu, is to adopt a \"fix as you go\" mentality rather than\ntrying to clean up all the data at once.\n\n\"We're HR, so we can't hit the pause button on data collection while we do a\ndata cleanup,\" she said. \"The better approach is to identify a key component\nthat you need to fix\u2014take things one step at a time.\"\n\nWith Customers, said Wu, it's your role to be the salesperson, counselor and\nproblem-solver. She broke the process of customer engagement into three steps:\n\n  * Listen like you're selling.\n  * Empathize like a counsellor.\n  * Own it like it's your problem. \"When you think of an issue like it's your problem, then it becomes a whole different ballgame.\"\n\nAs for Tools, Wu said it's important to understand that you probably won't\nhave a big budget to start out with. The key, she said, is to use the\norganization's existing tools to get a talent analytics program underway.\n\n\"Excel and PowerPoint are amazing things,\" said Wu. For visual storytelling,\nshe suggested going on Pinterest to find examples of compelling presentations\nto help sell the importance of analytics.\n\n[**Watch our HR Tech videos 2019\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/videos/)\n\nWith People\u2014or the analytics team\u2014the key is to understand that \"the right\nskill-set is really hard to find,\" she said. The wisest approach is to find\npeople within the organization who can help you.\n\nStarting out, your team should include:\n\n  * Someone who's been in the business and understands the problems the organization is facing.\n  * Someone who can use the tools at your disposal. \"They don't need to be an expert coder, but they should understand things like data sets.\"\n  * Someone who's a \"good storyteller\" to help sell the solution.\n\nFinally, there's \"You.\"\n\n\"You may find yourself asking 'Am I doing this wrong?'\" said Wu. \"The answer\nis probably yes, but then again, so is everyone else.\"\n\nWhen you're embarking on a task such as this, she said, it's OK to be wrong.\n\n\"Accept the unknown,\" said Wu. \"Accept the possibility that your hypothesis\nmight not be the right one. The key is patience, persistence and a willingness\nto roll up your sleeves and be open to challenges.\"\n\nAndrew R.

The term human resources' was\ncoined in the 1960s for the very first time. Human resource management aims at\nincreasing the effectiveness of a business or an organization.\n\nThe entire spectrum of work, such as creating, cultivating, and managing the\nemployer-employee relationship comes under human resources. Businesses can be\nsmall, medium, or large, and depending on the size, appropriate work force is\nrequired to carry out activities smoothly. For that, the need for workforce\noptimization is being felt as it helps in making operations more efficient.\nWorkforce optimization does that by aligning skills and resources to a\nspecific job, empower the HR manager to monitor an employee's contribution and\nperformance, record performance data in a structured form that helps in\ndecision making, and track work progress and identify missed goals. This helps\nin developing an understanding of an employee's strengths and weaknesses.\nTherefore, by articulating a commendable workforce planning strategy, HR\nanalytics software is helping organizations remain strong and flourish.\n\nHR analytics is helping industries, such as retail, banking, financial\nservices, and insurance (BFSI), government, manufacturing, energy & utilities,\nentertainment, oil & gas, hospitality, automotive, logistics, information\ntechnology & telecom, education, and healthcare organize their workflow. The\nBFSI sector faces a crisis in recruiting new talent and finding a replacement\nfor people nearing the age of retirement or people who leave. Further, as the\njob profile in this sector is pretty rigid, the BFSI sector doesn't come\nacross as the ideal choice of workplace for many young professionals.\nTherefore, the HR analytics software is helping these organizations in\ncreating a personalized employee experience in the same way as marketing\ndepartments work for providing personalized customer experience. Further, the\nsoftware employs artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to establish\ntrends from the HR data and data from other sources, such as the social media.\n\n**Key Topics Covered:**\n\n**Chapter 1.

And HR professionals who develop\ntheir proficiency with data will soon reap the benefits of this change.\n\nHR has traditionally been aligned with the 'soft' sciences of psychology and\nsociology. But thanks to the advent of Big Data in the social sciences, HR\nprofessionals now understand the value of being data-savvy.\n\n\"The HR profession, in fact, is one of the largest professions where one can\nlearn to use data for decision making,\" said Dr. Jaclyn Lee, CHRO at the\nSingapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and a renowned leader in\nthe area of HR data analytics.\n\nREAD MORE: [Four steps to maximise the value of HR\nanalytics](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/four-steps-to-maximise-\nthe-value-of-hr-analytics/144015)\n\n\"A lot of the other functions like finance, operations and marketing have\ntraditionally been using data to make decisions. Well, HR professionals now\nhave to learn to be a lot more data-savvy to be able\u2026to make more objective\ndecisions.\"\n\nDr. Lee, one of the panellists at the upcoming [HR Leaders Summit in\nSingapore](https://hrleadersasia.com/singapore/index.php/schedules/leadership-\nstream), will share her insights on how organizations can capitalize on data.\nHer team at SUTD has incorporated analytics into its practice for a couple of\nyears now.\n\n\"We have actually been using data in almost every function here in HR,\" she\nsaid. These functions range from recruitment to benefits administration and\nleadership development. \"Lately, I see a lot of interest in this area.\"\n\n**How can HR learn data analytics?**\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n\"It's a continuous process,\" Dr. Lee shared, emphasizing the need for HR\npractitioners to make time to learn data science no matter how hectic their\nwork days.\n\nOne of the first skills her team had to master was how to cleanse data.\n\n\"Sometimes you might not be able to interpret [your data set] correctly,\" she\nsaid. \"When you are doing data analytics, data management and data cleansing\nbecome very, very important.\n\n\"My team started the data cleansing process a couple of years back,\noverhauling the data and knowing how to pull data from various sources.\"\n\nREAD MORE: [Data analysts like gold dust to\nHR](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/data-analysts-like-gold-dust-to-\nhr/151128)\n\n\"When it comes to the mathematical drilling - that is not the difficult part -\nyou can get analysts, people with a statistical background or machine learning\nskills,\" she said. \"You know, people who know how to develop mathematical\nformulas to run the data set.\"\n\nLearning data science from the point of view of HR, however, entails a\nparadigm shift.\n\n\"The HR profession has always relied on gut instincts using very descriptive\ndata,\" she said. \"The idea is to change your mindset from one that's reactive\nto one that's proactive.\"\n\nBeing proactive in identifying data patterns and knowing what they might mean\npushed her to send her team for some technical training so that they know how\nto use data to do predictive analysis.\n\n**How can HR analytics support the business?**\n\nData management - in HR and beyond - requires team effort, explained Dr Lee.\nHR cannot do it alone - IT is needed to help \"pull the data\" and analysts are\nrequired for data crunching.\n\n\"Even if you cannot be an expert data scientist, you should know enough to\ntell the data scientist what's right,\" she said. \"Understanding Big Data is\nimportant. In fact, skills such as algorithm [development], design and data\nanalysis will become core skills for the HR profession.\"\n\nHR analytics isn't contained in its own universe, however. Much of the\nanalyzing done in the field of HR is concerned with real-world business\nproblems, she said.\n\nFor example, if HR faced any hiring challenges, HR can use data to answer\nquestions like: 'How can I solve this recruitment problem? How can I know\nthat, in the next five years, I'm able to find the manpower to support the\nbusiness?'\n\nWhat you can do, said Dr. Lee, is to work with the business to understand:\n\n  * Skills sets you need to hire for\n  * The talent you'll need in the next five years\n\n\"Then you need to understand the pattern,\" she said. \"As an HR practitioner\nyou start to look at the data set to [understand] the capabilities of the\npeople.\"\n\nAdditionally, HR should also monitor retention rates - and analysing data sets\ncan help HR determine if there's a \"potential for people leaving\".\n\n\"The idea is data analytics [should not be done] for the sake of analytics,\"\nshe said. \"You have to be able to use data to support the business.\n\n\"A lot of things are actually related to human capital, so you've got to be\nable to solve all kinds of problems using data analytics.\"\n\n**Catch Dr. Jaclyn Lee at the HR Leaders Summit held on 3 October at Hilton\nSingapore.**

human resources industry is a lot more than collecting and tracking\nemployee information today. Over time it has evolved and gained focus on using\nthe available data to create deep analytical connections throughout the\norganization.\n\n## What is Human Resources Analytics?\n\nHuman resources (HR) analytics uses data mining and business analytics\ntechniques to process HR data. It is also known as talent analytics. Here,\ndata mining is the study of established databases to generate more\ninformation.\n\n[HR analytics](https://www.cleverism.com/beginners-guide-hr-analytics/) serves\ntwo main purposes, which are providing insights to the team and identifying\nkey data. When HR analytics is used to provide insights, the main aim is to\ngive the company all necessary information regarding their operations. This\ncan be helpful in creating efficient employee management processes and ensure\nthe organization achieves its business goals within the given timeframe. When\nit comes to identifying key data, HR analytics is used to provide various\nmodels to predict ways in which the enterprise can gain optimal ROI on its\nhuman capital.\n\nThe main purpose HR analytics serves to an organization is to help the human\nresources personnel make the most of their collected data. Companies usually\nhave a lot of data on their employees such as their demographics, training\nrecords and so on. HR analytics is used to make sense of this data and use it\nto benefit their company. HR analytics can help in improving overall employee\nperformance and also help in predicting the models that work best for the\ncompany. There is no human error in decision making anymore.\n\n![](https://itmunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Importance-of-Human-\nResources-Analytics.jpg)\n\n## How Can Human Resources Analytics Benefit the Company?\n\n### Recruitment\n\nHR analytics can help companies with finding the right candidates for their\nbusiness. With HR analytics, one can use the collected data to help in\nidentifying the candidate qualities which will yield better results for the\ncompany by compiling the existing employee data and finding common\ndenominators that are useful to the company.\n\n### Health and Safety\n\nHR analytics can help in detecting all problem areas, especially when it comes\nto issues related to health and safety. Collected data can be used to point\nout the roles and job locations, among other factors that have the most rates\nof accidents.\n\n### Employee retention\n\nData collected through HR analytics can also help employers learn more about\ntheir employee retention. HR analytics can be put to use to help businesses\ndiscover the aspects that lead to higher employee engagement.\n\n### Talent gaps\n\nThere might be departments that have workers with more skills and there might\nbe some that prevent the total performance of the company from improving. This\ninformation can be easily acquired through data.\n\n### Sales performance\n\nHR analytics can be of big help when it comes to providing details the way\nsales targets can exceed. There are a few specific talents, which can be\ngathered with HR analytics that can help employees improve their performance,\nor there can be training programs that were conducted that yielded better\nresults and immediate returns when it comes to sales.\n\n## Top Priorities for Companies when Implementing HR Analytics\n\nThere are five main [priorities](https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/hr-\nanalytics-implementation-step-by-step-approach/) that companies need to take\ninto consideration when they are beginning the implementation process for HR\nanalytics in their business. These are: data management, systems or reporting\nor dashboarding, pilot analysis, capability building and privacy.\n\n### Data Management\n\nAll companies need a concrete data governance program to help them in defining\na specific policy that will hold the responsible people accountable for\nvarious elements of the data. This includes the following:\n\n  * Data accuracy\n  * Accessibility\n  * Consistency\n  * Completeness\n\nCompanies need to ideally facilitate their HR teams by setting goals as well\nas KPIs and measures to help them measure their KPIs. This can be done by\nmaking sure that the main HR processes are all totally based on facts. The\nmain processes that KPIs need to focus on include recruitment, absenteeism and\nturnover.\n\n### Systems/Reporting/Dashboarding\n\nThe second priority would be showcasing how the data management performance\nrelates to the company\u2019s business. The quickest and easiest way to do so would\nbe to invest in or build an effective and automated HR-dashboard.\n\nCompanies need to select the personnel that works with the HR dashboard, and\nthese selected employees should have access where they can create cross-\nsections to be able to see which figures are most important when it comes to\ntheir appointed focus area. After creating a dashboard, companies can gain\nvarious insights in the form of HR data and KPI\u2019s.\n\n### Pilot Analyses\n\nWhen conducting pilot analysis for your company, it is important to have a set\nof several skills within the analytics. There are many roles that companies\nneed to analyze their data, which include the following:\n\n  * HR analytics Manager\n  * Data Scientist \n  * IT Expert \n  * Subject Matter Expert \n  * Business Expert \n\nCompanies should also keep in mind the methodology that they use. It should be\nable to shape the given analytics into project form, and working with an agile\nway would be the best way to do it.\n\n### Capability Building\n\nStart the company\u2019s capacity with HR business partners because they are the\nones in constant contact with the customers, and they are the ones who will\nbenefit most by using HR analytics as a tool.\n\nAfter gathering all HR business partners, introduce them to the basics of HR\nanalytics. If a more in-depth knowledge transfer is required, then it is\nrecommended to collaborate with an external supplier. The suppliers can uplift\nthe development of the HR business partners by conducting various workshops to\nmake the company a more data-driven one, or even by giving them practice\nmaterial to help them build an internal analytics acumen.\n\nThe target groups need to be created structurally, and they should ideally\ninclude more than just a couple of introductions and workshops. For developing\na fact-based culture within the HR department in any company, one needs to\ndevelop its analytical capabilities carefully and structurally.\n\n### Privacy\n\nIt is recommended for companies to partner with their Privacy Department and\nPrivacy Officer that takes care of all legal and compliance issues. They need\nto build an assessment framework for the company before beginning HR analytics\nwith the most important privacy targets.\n\nWorking within the compliance and legal framework is crucial for all\ncompanies. This is why organizations need to maintain a good partnership with\ntheir Privacy Department. Companies should ideally discuss all analysis\nresults with their Privacy Department and then let them set the requirements\nof the minimum number of people they can report on.\n\n## Main Steps to Get Started with HR Analytics\n\n### Centralize all Employee Data\n\nThe first step for companies when they want to [begin their HR analytics\njourney](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/5-steps-to-get-\nstarted-with-hr-analytics/) is to unify all disparate sources of existing\nemployee data into one single repository. Usually the employee data is\nscattered across various HR systems such as Excel spreadsheets and paper\nrecords. When data is spread across many systems, it becomes difficult to\naccess. The entire process is inefficient and time-consuming. If there is just\none source, then the data accuracy as well as data consistency improves for\nthe company. Consolidate all employee data to help companies identify various\nKPIs to help them understand how their performance works with business\noutcomes.\n\n### Create an HR Dashboard\n\nData visualization is a very important part of any company\u2019s analytics\ninitiative. When companies build their HR dashboard, it works as a centralized\nplace for collecting all internal and external HR data. When there is a visual\nrendition of all the collected data, the HR team will then be able to both\nmonitor as well as benchmark data. This will help them in deriving insights\ninto specific HR metrics that drive success. Real-time information about all\nthe important HR metrics become easy to access, such as the headcount,\nattrition rates, cost-to-hire, and more.\n\n### Build Analytical Capabilities\n\nHR analytics is still fairly a new concept to most HR teams. This is why HR\nteams usually lack the skills that are needed to lead successful and effective\nanalytics deployment initiatives. This is why it becomes extremely important\nto develop the HR teams and give them the skills they need to perform\nsuccessful HR analytics. This can be done with training alongside the\ncompany\u2019s business intelligence team. Once the HR team has a strong analytics\nskill set within the company, it becomes possible to establish an even better\nbusiness context for all human capital decisions.\n\n### Put HR Analytics into Practice\n\nAfter the HR team has created a strong skill set for analytics, the next step\nwould be to identify business problems that need to be solved. It could range\nfrom anything such as improving retention or identifying high-performers to\nreducing the cost to company for each hire.\n\nTeams need to be able to link their analytics to help them achieve business\noutcomes. The best way to do this is to prioritize the problem at hand based\non the following criteria:\n\n  * Business impact \n  * Effort required\n\nThis impact vs. effort matrix should always be the first step when conducting\nanalytics. It is ideal to begin with ideas which have a high impact but\nrequire minimal effort.\n\n### Drive Continuous Improvement\n\nOnce the implementation process is in place for HR analytics to solve business\nproblems, the team needs to monitor their processes continuously and check for\ninefficiencies, errors, and risks that could take place. They also need to\nfollow up on all recurring issues as well as implement the necessary\nstructural changes that are required to prevent these errors in the future.\nAfter all inconsistencies have been removed, the team can move to the next\nstep, which is Predictive HR Analytics.\n\n## Helpful Tips for Getting Started with HR Analytics\n\n### Educate Yourself\n\nBefore [beginning the HR analytics\njourney](https://www.unleashgroup.io/news/10-tips-to-getting-started-with-hr-\nanalytics), all the teams involved should read up and become familiar with\nanalytics.\n\n### Subscribe to Blogs\n\nThere are also a lot of blogs available for reading on HR analytics. These\nwill also help with keeping you updated on the latest trends and updates in\nanalytics.\n\n### Join some LinkedIn Groups\n\nThere are a few specialist HR analytics groups available on LinkedIn which can\nprove to be quite useful to companies because they have a large number of\nmembers who regularly host discussions about this niche.\n\n### Network with the Experts\n\nHR is a very well known function in a company, and it is renowned for\nnetworking. Team members should interact with other experts in the field and\nlearn what they can from them.\n\n### Become Familiar with the HR Analytics Vendor Space\n\nThe most progressive and exciting work being done in the HR analytics field is\nby a lot of start ups. There are new firms that are coming up nearly each and\nevery day in what can be considered a nascent space. When one looks closely\nthough, you see that a new practitioner of HR analytics will find these firms\nextremely helpful in guiding them with taking the first step.\n\n### Plan the First Hundred Days\n\nGetting started is usually the most difficult part of any endeavour. The first\nfew days and the amount of effort you put into them is what determines the\nsuccess rate of any project. Companies need to recognize that the first\nhundred days are the most crucial ones to the success of any business\ninitiative. All aspiring HR analytics leaders need to plan the first hundred\ndays at least to help them get started.\n\n### Identify the Business Problems\n\nThe first rule of HR analytics is to start with the problems in the business.\nTake into consideration all challenges the company faces and conclude the ones\nthat a thorough HR analysis would help in solving. HR teams need to work with\nfinance and IT teams to gain valuable knowledge in making the right decisions\n\n![](https://itmunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Importance-of-Human-\nResources-Analytics-2.jpg)\n\n### Perfect Your Storytelling Skills\n\nImplementation and execution of initiatives that are linked to HR analytics is\nvery similar to good storytelling. The steps involved are interpreting the\ngiven data, then using it and distilling it into insights which will help in\nunlocking business problems that the company is trying to solve. After which\nyou create a compelling argument and make your case to frame the entire\nprocess. This is extremely important because the quality of the data will not\nmatter, neither will the incisiveness of the analysis if you cannot make the\ngathered information resonate with the ones who have a stake in your business.\n\n**SEE ALSO** **:**[New media funding firm, Attention Capital obtains\nGirlboss](https://itmunch.com/new-media-funding-firm-attention-capital-\nobtains-girlboss/)\n\nFor more updates and the latest tech news, keep reading iTMunch.\n\nSHARE\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fitmunch.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-human-resources-\nanalytics%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Importance+of+Human+Resources+Analytics%C2%A0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitmunch.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-human-resources-\nanalytics%2F&via=iTMunch)[__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitmunch.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-human-resources-\nanalytics%2F&title=The+Importance+of+Human+Resources+Analytics%C2%A0&source=)[__](whatsapp://send?text=The+Importance+of+Human+Resources+Analytics%C2%A0%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fitmunch.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-human-resources-analytics%2F)\n\n[![](https://itmunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Elon-Musks-tweet-on-Tesla-\nviolates-settlement-agreement-2-150x150.jpg)\n\nElon Musk's tweet on Tesla violates settlement agreement; US governor tells\nthe court\n\n\u00ab Previous](https://itmunch.com/elon-musks-tweet-tesla-violates-settlement-\nagreement-us-governor-tells-court/)\n\n[![](https://itmunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iTMunch-\nLogo-8-1-150x150.jpg)\n\nOnline mortgage broker Trussle loses founding CEO\n\nNext \u00bb](https://itmunch.com/online-mortgage-broker-trussle-loses-founding-\nceo/)\n\n[![](https://itmunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/iTMunch-1-150x150.png)](https://itmunch.com/author/itmunch/)\n\n[iTMunch](https://itmunch.com/author/itmunch/)\n\nAt iTMunch, we strive to bring to our readers all the latest news about\ntechnology in various verticals around the world.

This includes cloud computing solutions,\nhub technologies, artificial intelligence, people analytics, process\nautomation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics. How\nindividuals interact with technology, along with the new tools at our\ndisposal, is changing how we work. HR can\u2019t sit idly by; it must help drive\nthe transformation. Yet making sense of the implications for HR is no simple\ntask.\n\nWalking the floor at the 2019 HR Tech Conference and Expo, we overheard some\nconsistent themes from HR professionals in attendance. The overwhelming number\nof vendors and point solutions meant more, not less, uncertainty when it comes\nto determining where they should invest. Many struggled to find value in the\nhuman capital management systems already in place; there were questions about\nwhat solution would work best given their circumstances, and who within the\norganization was making the decisions. In many instances, it seemed that the\nentire process of deciding on the right technology was in the hands of IT,\nrather than HR.\n\nConference attendees express a consistent need to do a better job of taking\nthe multitude of disparate, inflexible platforms that make up current HR\nservice delivery and find ways to tie these together to create a more\ncompelling employee experience and to make it easier for HR teams to integrate\nplatforms so they can be more productive. It\u2019s about simplifying the complex.\nThis need for a consistent employee experience \u2013 every touchpoint between HR\nprograms and the individual employee - aligned with the employer\u2019s distinct\nEmployee Value Proposition, seemed to be the Holy Grail of the conference\nexperience.\n\nSo how can organizations make sense of this bewildering technological market?\nI believe the answer is to focus on the three most useful and promising\ntechnologies that HR can use to make smarter decisions faster.\n\n### **Hub Technologies: Centering the experience around the individual**\n\n  \nTo keep the \u201chuman\u201d in HR, technology should focus on helping individuals make\ninformed decisions about the rewards and development programs available to\nthem.\n\nOrganizations clearly want the best talent possible to deliver on their\nmission. When done right, that mission is tied directly to its unique employee\nvalue proposition (EVP). There\u2019s no such thing as a cookie-cutter approach for\ndeveloping an EVP \u2013 every organization must differentiate its strategy based\non its unique brand and a sense of purpose. Likewise, there\u2019s no such thing as\na \u201cbest practice\u201d for adopting HR technologies relevant to specific\norganizations.\n\nNo two employers have the same talent goals, so the right ecosystem for one\norganization may not be right for the next. A global software developer has\nvery different HR needs from a mid-sized Midwestern manufacturer. While there\nare plenty of behind-the-scenes processes and transactions that are similar\nfor both, the need to entice and motivate talent requires a very organization-\nspecific mix of employee-facing technologies.\n\nAlong with creating a unique EVP, there are millions of distinct employee\nexpectations. The best employee experience is designed for every individual we\nserve, which demands that we treat each one uniquely, using communication\nchannels, content, tone, and data aligned with each person\u2019s expectations.\n\nHuman-centered design, the process of building out the full user (in this\ncase, employee) experience based on the people you\u2019re designing for, and\nending with interactions that are tailor-made to suit their needs, helps to\nachieve this audience-of-one focus. A generic approach can be valuable for\ntop-down communication, but not much else. Even persona-driven models that\nhelp narrow the ideal experience still run the risk of being overly\nstereotyped. Personalized models assure individual data, including past\ninteractions, is used to create a meaningful employee experience with the\nright messaging and tone, delivered via the right channel.\n\nContextual experience \u2013 serving up the right content at the right time -\nprovides the added benefit of drawing only on _relevant_ work and life events\nfor a hyper-personalized approach. The more contextual, and therefore more\nvaluable to the individual, the more likely the communication will deliver the\ndesired results, for both the employee and the organization.\n\nThe advent of hub technologies, coupled with tailored employer branding and\nback-end analytics, helps both employers and employees stay the course for\nimproved performance and better outcomes for all. As artificial intelligence\nsystems \u201clearn\u201d more about the individual\u2019s preferences (through machine\nlearning), the technology adapts to the personal preferences of the individual\nregardless of the systems running in the background. This is where companies\ncan best adapt their vendor selection strategy: keeping the employee\nexperience relevant while maintaining consistent process flow and metrics.\n\n### **People Analytics: Improving people and business performance**\n\n  \nPeople analytics is now the lifeblood of HR\u2019s role in workforce planning.\nMeasuring and analyzing this slice of \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014data on performance,\ncompensation, demographics, career history, benefits, employee behaviors, time\nutilization, and attrition\u2014can help identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, address recruitment and retention challenges,\ncapture ROI from HR initiatives, and uncover leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nPeople analytics is also collapsing the narrow siloes of talent, benefits,\nwellness, or population health, bringing them all together to intersect and\nimpact the employee experience and benefit the individual.\n\n### **Predictive Analytics: The power of insight**\n\n  \nClosely aligned with people, analytics is the power of looking into the\nfuture: predictive analytics. Workforce data gives HR and business leaders the\nability to make evidence-based decisions to address and improve turnover\ntrends, retain high performers, forecast talent needs, and even anticipate\nlegal risks with poor performers. More the predictive analytics guide the\norganization in selecting and developing its talent, rewards, and HR programs,\nthe better the results for both the company and the individual.\n\nOrganizations that took our [Global Wellbeing\nSurvey](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__content.buck.com_working-2Dwell-2Dglobal-2Dsurvey-2Dof-2Dworkforce-2Dstrategies&d=DwMFaQ&c=9wxE0DgWbPxd1HCzjwN8Eaww1\n--ViDajIU4RXCxgSXE&r=tLT_yNhQo0KunNn7QxL-\nOmi122ic3DN53x7UXHir3Vg&m=jWz9vjRygNrctxedb3c5-_EVz5UZmFQNYTS3WV4A61E&s=eR0oM0adZcs8DigTmnH8fkFVNXRdkQ5wb3oOqQMTjsM&e=)\nreleased earlier this year rated the effectiveness of predictive analytics at\nan incredible 84%. But given the high cost of this investment, it\u2019s critical\nthat HR and IT work together to include a number of scenarios across the full\nrange of business needs, not just predicting isolated hiring and development\nneeds.\n\n### **Cutting through the noise**\n\n  \nThere are many HR technologies and services on the market. It\u2019s critical never\nto lose sight of the goal: technology should be able to help companies \u2013 and\ntheir employees \u2013 make smarter decisions, faster. Administrative platforms\nrunning behind the scenes should have as their goal improving business\ndecisions and corporate outcomes. Employee-facing systems need to support the\nways people actually use their benefits, track progress in meeting their\ncareer goals, and engage with the ways the company bolsters the employee\nexperience across the health, wealth, and career spectrum.\n\n**Learn More:[20 HR Metrics You Need to Track in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/important-hr-\nmetrics/)**\n\nBut there\u2019s never an off-the-rack approach when it comes to engaging with\nemployees, and HR leaders need to evaluate their infrastructure and unique\nchallenges continuously. Each organization has distinct needs that, once\nclearly identified, should point to the technology that will best address\nthose needs.\n\nMany of the conference attendees we met embraced the model of pulling the\nentire HR tech landscape together for the organization, through the powerful\nanalytics tools we\u2019ve been talking about. They hold on to the dream that\npeople and business decisions can be made with all relevant data aggregated.\nThat speaks to the need for HR to take the lead in helping IT see the value of\nfull people data analysis.\n\nAligning the personal needs of employees with the business needs of the\norganization \u2013 the social contract \u2013 is indispensable to achieving success for\nboth workers and employers. For HR in the throes of figuring out the best\ntechnology to use, it\u2019s the only strategy that will pay off.\n\n**Learn More:[7 Sentiment Analysis Tools to Improve Employee Engagement in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/sentiment-\nanalytics-tools-features-price/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Making Sense of HR Tech in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

Littler\u2019s Scott Forman discusses how HR can leverage new\ntechnologies to deliver efficiencies and actionable insights._**\n\nHR managers are fielding a constant stream of employment questions and\nresponding to an ever-growing list of issues that arise in an evolving\nworkplace. Finding the bandwidth to thoroughly and promptly address every\nquestion can be challenging \u2013 but missing even minor issues can expose the\ncompany to potential monetary and reputational risk.\n\nIn addition to managing multiple responsibilities and demands on their time,\nHR departments are the recipients of vast amounts of data from across their\norganizations \u2013 data that often goes unused. That means there is a significant\nuntapped opportunity within organizations to analyze HR data to uncover\ninsights that benefit the company, potentially creating a more positive work\nenvironment, increasing employee engagement and retention, and identifying and\nmitigating risks.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThis article explores two ways HR departments can use technology and data-\ndriven solutions to provide more consistent and high-quality counsel across\ntheir organizations and to leverage their own data to make better workplace\ndecisions.\n\n## **Creating a Knowledge Bank**\n\nThe first step in taking advantage of the power of data analytics is gathering\nall relevant information in one place. Looking specifically at the challenges\nthat come with the increasing volume of workplace legal questions, HR\ndepartments should work to capture all of the questions they receive and the\nassociated responses in a single online platform. Then, they can draw upon the\nplatform to answer similar queries in the future. Many employee questions and\nworkplace issues follow similar themes, meaning a unified resource can provide\nconsistency in how matters are addressed, as well as efficiency in the\nresponse process.\n\nThis approach helps HR managers respond to questions a single time, as opposed\nto continuous, one-off responses across the company. Also, as similar\nquestions arise from different parts of the company, HR is better positioned\nto provide consistent advice.\n\nA single platform can also help ensure that institutional knowledge can be\naccessed 24/7. And in another nod toward consistency, a technology-based\nsolution keeps institutional knowledge with the company in perpetuity \u2013 rather\nthan storing it in the mind of an HR manager who may depart to another\nemployer.\n\n## **Analyze Data to Spot Trends**\n\nOnce the data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze that\ndata to spot recurring issues and identify potential risk areas. By\nunderstanding which issues occur most frequently, HR teams can direct training\nand other resources to trouble spots before they develop into larger issues or\nresult in costly litigation. Rather than providing one-off counsel as\nquestions arise, HR teams can look at the big picture by analyzing such areas\nas the issues being addressed, where in the business questions are arising,\nand which policies or practices are implicated.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that employers are eager for data-focused solutions. In a recent\ninternal survey, Littler asked nearly 120 in-house counsel and HR executives\nbased in the United States what type of insights they want their law firms to\ndeliver via data analytics. More than two-thirds (67 percent) said they were\ninterested in analyses of their own data to help monitor trends, identify\nareas of risk and guide decision-making.\n\nAnd this interest goes beyond the US. In another recent\n[survey](https://www.littler.com/files/2019_littler_european_employer_survey.pdf)\nLittler conducted of more than 550 European employers, just 24 percent of\nrespondents said they are not using AI or data analytics to improve workforce\nmanagement decisions.\n\nThrough an online portal we\u2019ve developed to provide answers to workplace legal\nquestions, we know that employers, armed with data-driven insights, can\nimprove their operations in a variety of ways. For example, a company may find\nthat individuals from across the organization are asking questions about a\nspecific policy, signaling a need for employee training or changes to the\npolicy itself.\n\n**Learn More:[8 Best HR Analytics Courses for New-Age HR\nProfessionals](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/eight-hr-\nanalytics-courses-2020/)**\n\nAdditionally, when a user submits questions through the platform that have\nbeen asked previously, the platform immediately provides attorney responses to\nsimilar requests. If the question has not been asked before, it is triaged to\ndetermine which legal professional is best suited to provide counsel. In this\nway, the technology provides a connection to receive quick and knowledgeable\ncounsel on both common and complex workplace questions, while ensuring the\nadvice is retained as part of the company\u2019s knowledge bank.\n\nThese are all important insights given the proliferation of HR-related\ntechnology and analytic tools that have emerged in the past several years \u2013\nand as HR departments continue to be tasked to do more with less.

Success\n\n[Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/analytics/) [Big\nData](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/insights/big-data/) [Latest\nNews](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\nby [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/ \"Posts by\nVivek Kumar\") [August 16, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/08/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/implementing-hr-analytics-\nstrategies-to-frame-your-business-success/#comments)\n\n![HR Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/HR-Analytics345-1024x541.jpg)\n\nAnalytics is the process of implementing meaningful patterns towards effective\ndecision-making, and it continues driving business decisions. The human\nresource department of an organization is also not an exception. The HR unit\nhas accountability to be people-centric and will continue to rely on the human\nto hire the best candidates for the company, and here data plays an imperative\nrole.\n\nHR analytics is an area in the field of analytics enabling HR professionals to\nmake data-driven decisions to tempt, manage, and retain employees, which\nimproves return on investment. It assists leaders to make decisions to create\nbetter work environments and capitalize on employee productivity. For high-\nperformance employers, a smart HR analytics strategy can unleash a lot of\noverarching benefits.\n\nSo, as HR analytics is a vital function of businesses and an essential portion\nof HR operations, how can companies successfully practice an HR analytics\nstrategy at their organization level?\n\n\n\n##### **Finding Germane Data**\n\nHR professionals must line up HR data and analysis to the organization\u2019s\nstrategic goals. The ultimate goals of the data and analysis of HR analytics\nare to support companies to better figure out what strategy they need to take\nwhen hiring, training, and retaining talent to grow their business. Once data\nis collected, HR analysts feed workforce data into sophisticated data models,\nalgorithms, and tools to accomplish actionable insights.\n\n\n\n##### **Having Right Skillsets**\n\nAll the data a company culled, will not help them without someone to interpret\nthat data. According to a report, just half of the companies, nearly 47%,\nbelieve one of the biggest impediments that an organization faces when it\ncomes to accomplishing better use of data, metrics, and predictive analysis by\nHR team and talent management professionals is having a lack of analytic\ncapabilities or skills among HR professionals. So, having the manpower with\nthe right skillsets is key in making the HR analytics more perfect.\n\n\n\n##### **Picking Up the Right Tools**\n\nThe right tools are certainly decisive to enable an HR analytics strategy.\nBecause much more solutions are becoming readily available today. Moreover,\ntechnology continues to advance and more data management and analytics tools\nare developing and becoming available now. Fortunately, there are several\ndevelopers and software companies allowing businesses to try their services\nand see whether they are a good fit for them or their business\u2019s needs.\n\n\n\n##### **Creating a Business Plan**\n\nTo create HR analytics strategy with having the right idea of what data you\nneed, the right software, and the right people to work with, the HR unit\nshould consider what they want to produce the best action plan to implement\nand benefit from their analytics. Later, documenting how these analyses will\nassist businesses to bring in the best talent, internally develop leaders, and\ncontribute to the organizations\u2019 success will be a significant step in getting\nthe most analytics.\n\n\n\n##### **Staying Compliant**\n\nStaying compliant with data and privacy laws is a vital part of an\norganization\u2019s HR [analytics\nstrategy](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-data-science-platforms-that-\ncash-the-analytics-code/). The information that HR teams have on employees\nincludes a lot of sensitive data like social security number, addresses, among\nothers. This means they have to emphasize privacy protection. So, making sure\ncompliance with employment and labor laws is a significant HR responsibility.\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/implementing-\nhr-analytics-strategies-to-frame-your-business-success/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/implementing-\nhr-analytics-strategies-to-frame-your-business-success/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/implementing-\nhr-analytics-strategies-to-frame-your-business-success/&title=Implementing HR\nAnalytics Strategies to Frame Your Business Success) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/implementing-\nhr-analytics-strategies-to-frame-your-business-\nsuccess/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HR-\nAnalytics345.jpg&description=Implementing HR Analytics Strategies to Frame\nYour Business Success)\n\n## About Author\n\nMore info about author\n\n[ ![Vivek\nKumar](//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c59463ef7ad349924783ff338f26e9e?s=130&r=g&d=mm)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n###  [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n[More by Vivek Kumar __](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n## Related Analytics Articles\n\nSimilar Posts From Analytics Category\n\n[ ![Role of Data Engineers\u2019 in Data Management\nPlatform](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/DMP-173x130_c.jpeg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/role-of-data-engineers-in-data-management-\nplatform/)\n\n#### [Role of Data Engineers\u2019 in Data Management\nPlatform](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/role-of-data-engineers-in-data-\nmanagement-platform/)\n\n[April 8, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/04/)\n\n[ ![Flipkart\u2019s Investment in AI was needed: It will Redefine Retail Industry\nin India](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sachin-\nbansal-image__1513831163_106.67.125.36-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/flipkart-investment-in-ai-was-needed-it-\nwill-redefine-retail-industry-in-india/)\n\n#### [Flipkart's Investment in AI was needed: It will Redefine Retail Industry\nin India](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/flipkart-investment-in-ai-was-\nneeded-it-will-redefine-retail-industry-in-india/)\n\n[December 24, 2017](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2017/12/)\n\n[ ![India to Boost 3 Million Tech Jobs in Next Five Years, Says\nISF](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tech-\nJobs-173x130_c.jpg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/india-boost-3-million-\ntech-jobs-next-five-years-says-isf/)\n\n#### [India to Boost 3 Million Tech Jobs in Next Five Years, Says\nISF](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/india-boost-3-million-tech-jobs-next-\nfive-years-says-isf/)\n\n[May 13, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/05/)\n\n## No Comments so far\n\nJump into a conversation\n\n### No Comments Yet!\n\nYou can be the one to start a conversation.\n\n###  [Click here to cancel reply.](/implementing-hr-analytics-strategies-to-\nframe-your-business-success/#respond)\n\n__**Your data will be safe!** Your e-mail address will not be published.

 \nS., Canada, U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, India,\nAustralia, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, U.A.E., South Africa, Turkey, Saudi\nArabia) - Global Industry Analysis and Growth Forecast to 2024  \n  \nHuman resource management (HR) is used as an umbrella term for describing the\nmanagement of employees in an organization. The term \u2018human resources\u2019 was\ncoined in the 1960s for the very first time. Human resource management aims at\nincreasing the effectiveness of a business or an organization. The entire\nspectrum of work, such as creating, cultivating, and managing the\nemployer\u2013employee relationship comes under human resources. Businesses can be\nsmall, medium, or large, and depending on the size, appropriate work force is\nrequired to carry out activities smoothly. For that, the need for workforce\noptimization is being felt as it helps in making operations more efficient.\nWorkforce optimization does that by aligning skills and resources to a\nspecific job, empower the HR manager to monitor an employee\u2019s contribution and\nperformance, record performance data in a structured form that helps in\ndecision making, and track work progress and identify missed goals. This helps\nin developing an understanding of an employee\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\nTherefore, by articulating a commendable workforce planning strategy, HR\nanalytics software is helping organizations remain strong and flourish.  \nHR analytics is helping industries, such as retail, banking, financial\nservices, and insurance (BFSI), government, manufacturing, energy & utilities,\nentertainment, oil & gas, hospitality, automotive, logistics, information\ntechnology & telecom, education, and healthcare organize their workflow. The\nBFSI sector faces a crisis in recruiting new talent and finding a replacement\nfor people nearing the age of retirement or people who leave. Further, as the\njob profile in this sector is pretty rigid, the BFSI sector doesn\u2019t come\nacross as the ideal choice of workplace for many young professionals.\nTherefore, the HR analytics software is helping these organizations in\ncreating a personalized employee experience in the same way as marketing\ndepartments work for providing personalized customer experience. Further, the\nsoftware employs artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to establish\ntrends from the HR data and data from other sources, such as the social media.\nThe HR analytics market is predicted to advance at a 15.6% CAGR in the coming\nyears, as reported in a study.  \nRead the full report:\n[https://www.reportlinker.com/p05842932/?utm_source=GNW](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lh7pBZNaQ1KzcGhe4u1sCJ33xE75TbLC4WpUu4WkWPwY-\noyRBs_au0aQyB2lHENr4mCH_KF41KRzO10pnugj2W2mEUUSVVrSJeoRdMTNkY8Wwn1ggnt97tdRN4FtfvZ2YT46B7sGjq_dw1H5M-yMLqTWJSxnF1lRpsF85UDxbOeFJdSxULcm2F1m5vklHdyG)  \n  \nAbout\n[Reportlinker](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mC2yMSVyYn4Ew38Od0SJ5KhB2MWRs6cG_Wh8byjSDW9w57Yp3GrUf7CrBzw0g8-9EU_cv70aTRqBo1w-kaGAjg==)  \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

by\nAlistair Shepherd\") on 29 Jul 2019 in [Evidence-based\nmanagement](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-strategy/evidence-based-\nmanagement/), [People

pressure to produce insights from employee data, but if\nthey 're not clear about where that data comes from and why, they could end up\nalienating staff and cause projects to fail. Alistair Shepherd explains. **\n\nHR analytics \u2013 the collection and analysis of data on employees \u2013 offers a\ngenuine opportunity to understand our workforces better.\n\nIt helps us to see not only trends and sentiment but also get a better\nunderstanding of how work actually gets done and where productivity comes from\nin the messy day to day.\n\n## People analytics\n\n**[People analytics: Good practice manual](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-\npractice-manual/people-\nanalytics/161599/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Which HR metrics will matter in\n2019?](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/commentary-and-analysis/which-hr-metrics-\nwill-matter-\nin-2019/164009/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nThis can make HR more effective than ever at improving the way work gets done\nand, hopefully, gives it a credible role in the business aside from \u201cjust a\ncost function\u201d.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that most HR analytics projects will fail, either because\nthey are too invasive of individual\u2018s privacy or more likely they\u2019re purely\nvoyeuristic exercises and don\u2019t provide a \u201cso what\u201d.\n\nIn both cases the solution to making HR analytics succeed is in being clear\nabout what the aim of the project is, how success will be measured and clearly\ncommunicating the benefit of the exercise to the workforce \u2013 it is their data\nafter all.\n\n## What about privacy?\n\nLet\u2019s start by addressing the privacy concern. The misuse of personal data is\nbecoming a regular headline that means employees are increasingly aware of how\ntheir digital footprints can be used.\n\nMost of the time the use of our personal data by corporations or governments\nis in our interest so we\u2019re amenable to the idea. But occasionally it is used\nto limit our freedoms.\n\nThe South China Morning Post recently reported that over 17 million people in\nChina have been restricted from purchasing a plane ticket because their social\ncredit score (maintained by the Chinese government) is too low.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a model citizen your data can be used to subconsciously\ninfluence your opinions without you even realising it, as demonstrated in 2016\nduring the US election and the UK referendum on Brexit.\n\n## Employee willingness\n\nBecause of these high-profile stories, it becomes easy to see how employees\nmight fear that data held by employers could be used to make decisions about\ncareer progression, development opportunities or even salary.\n\nFearing this, many employees will be reluctant to engage in data collection\nactivities or analytics projects. Since analytics relies on data, HR analytics\noften relies on the willingness of the employee base to be measured or\nmonitored.\n\nThe good news is that a good number of HR departments already understand the\nrisks associated with collecting employee data.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2018 Human Capital Trends Report found that more than 50% of their\nsurvey respondents (senior HR leaders) are \u201cactively managing the risk of\nemployee perceptions of personal data use and a similar proportion is managing\nthe risk of legal liability, yet only a quarter are managing the impact on\ntheir consumer brand\u201d.\n\nThis means that organisations considering broad scale HR analytics projects\nneed to develop a set of well-defined policies, security safeguards,\ntransparency measures and ongoing communication around the use of people data\nor risk employee, customer and societal backlash.\n\n##  People analytics opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more people analytics\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/people-analytics/)\n\nThe second and arguably more common reason that HR analytics projects fail is\nthat they\u2019re voyeuristic exercises with no clear objective or reason to exist\nbeyond just being able to see data. And if there\u2019s no objective, how can we\nsucceed?\n\nIn 2016 Deloitte reported that most (77%) of HR professionals felt that people\nanalytics were important, but only 32% felt ready or somewhat ready to\nimplement them.\n\nThe real question is, important for what? Being \u201cinsight-led\u201d doesn\u2019t count as\na reason. Being \u201cdata driven\u201d shouldn\u2019t be the primary purpose to launch an HR\nanalytics centre of excellence.\n\nThe question should really be, what are our (HR\u2019s) current objectives? What\nbig questions are we trying to answer? Analytics projects shouldn\u2019t be carried\nout for their own purposes, they should be a prerequisite for achieving a\nbigger objective.\n\nOnce you have a clear objective (for example, to understand why some managers\nget high performance out of their team while others don\u2019t) then you need to\nconstruct a hypothesis.\n\nA hypothesis is your guess at the reason(s) behind the phenomenon. Maybe your\nguess is that the high performing managers have regular one-to-ones with their\nteam and the low performing managers don\u2019t.\n\nThe goal of your analytics project should be to collect data that can prove or\ndisprove this hypothesis.\n\n## Business and employee needs\n\nTo be most useful, analytics projects should connect to a business need. Even\nbetter, connect to an employee need.\n\nThen, HR must clearly communicate the benefit to the end user \u2013 in the example\nabove that benefit might be communicated as helping managers develop their\npeople skills. Even better than communicating the benefit to employees, is to\nput them in control of realising that benefit.\n\nGiven that most HR analytics projects will be looking at people problems, very\noften you\u2019ll be looking at changing the way people behave.\n\nSo one of the questions that needs to be answered in order to avoid the voyeur\ntrap is:\n\nIf the data confirms my hypothesis, am I in a position to act on it?\n\nAt Saberr we worked with an international technology firm who were going\nthrough a big change programme after a change in senior leadership.\n\nIt identified that one of the barriers to change was the fact that not all\nmanagers were communicating strategy to their direct reports \u2013 which had a\nknock-on effect of teams lower in the business being unclear on their\nobjectives. Identifying where the issues were enabled managers to get more\nthan 20% improvement in team performance after six months.\n\nGiving employees not just the accountability but also the autonomy to solve\nproblems themselves makes analytics projects far more likely to succeed \u2013 and\nless of a burden for HR.\n\n## Does it really benefit employees?\n\nOf course, not all projects will directly benefit employees. An example of\nthis is one study that suggested a link between commute distance and retention\nwhereby the further you have to commute to work, the more likely you are to\nleave.\n\nActing on this data might mean prioritising recruitment activities in the\nlocal area or offering relocation benefits. Neither of which clearly benefit\nemployees directly.\n\nHowever, the principles of connecting to a business need and clearly and\ntransparently communicating why this data is helpful to the company should\nremain as key principles.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to hear that implementing HR data analytics is a daunting\nprospect.\n\nTo avoid the issues with both privacy and voyeurism the easiest way to ensure\nthe success of your HR analytics project is to clearly define the benefit and\ncommunicate this to all stakeholders involved.\n\nIf the benefit is solely for the HR function \u2013 that is fine \u2013 but employees\nwill engage in the process far more readily if they understand why it\u2019s\nimportant and how it will help improve the company.\n\n![Alistair Shepherd](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/07/alistairshep.jpeg)\n\n#### About Alistair Shepherd\n\nAlistair Shepherd is founder of [Saberr](http://www.saberr.com/)\n\n[ View all posts by Alistair Shepherd ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/alistairshepherd/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/two-thirds-of-employers-\nstruggling-to-find-staff/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/employment-tribunal-waiting-\ntimes-2019/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Why do most HR analytics projects fail?_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7fe996260483c7fad5bebde9e5362255?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAmy Armitage 1 Aug 2019 at 5:50 pm [#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-\ndo-most-hr-analytics-projects-fail/#comment-62112 \"Direct link to this\ncomment\")\n\nExcellent article. I would argue that another reason that projects fail is\nthat they lack a direct tie in to measurable business goals and do not\ndemonstrate (or model) financial and or business impact. HR Analytics\nprofessionals need to grow their business acumen, defined by the Financial\nTimes as \u201cKeenness and speed in understanding and deciding on a business\nsituation.\u201d\n\nReply\n\n  2. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c84e690cfcd22252111fac6720710932?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nJim Smith 14 Aug 2019 at 8:49 pm [#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-do-\nmost-hr-analytics-projects-fail/#comment-63508 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nThe article misses the mark by quite a wide margin. There's an elephant in the\nmiddle of the HR Analytics room, and everyone is looking the other way. There\nis no research stating the abysmal results of the EE/EX wave are because\nleadership believed decades of employee survey data wasn't accurate or\nactionable. Leadership didn't have to take action, they simply ignored the\ndata they didn't like, and HR analytics data will most certainly suffer the\nsame fate.  \nFirst, HR is not positioned to force change on a disinterested leadership.\nThey are victims of the same culture they are being asked to fix, how much\nsense does that make. The data is the least impactful aspect of changing\nEE/EX. The only ways to fix the problem is to have the CEO ask the question,\nHR is on the sidelines and a third party is collecting the responses and\nforcing the blockers before the CEO to justify their resistance versus the\nemployees stated benefits to making the change. It is naive to think\nleadership is altruistic. They resist just like the rest of the humans on the\npayroll. Believing the data makes a bit of difference is ignoring that big\npachyderm standing right in front of you. If the CEO thought HR could impact\nEE/EX to the extent the business would be improved, then every CHRO would have\nEE as a major component of their bonus plan. That's not the case.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/why-do-most-hr-analytics-\nprojects-fail/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/09/judith-grant-mace-635.jpg)Mace Group to\ndiscuss engaging the board via metrics at Employee Benefits\nLive](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/mace-group-to-discuss-engaging-the-\nboard-via-metrics-at-employee-benefits-live/ \"Mace Group to discuss engaging\nthe board via metrics at Employee Benefits Live\")\n\nMace Group's Judith Grant will discuss how HR professionals can engage senior\nleaders with employee wellbeing using metrics and analytics...\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/11/Sage_People_featured___.jpg)Goodbye HR, hello\n\u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/changing-face-of-hr-report-sage-\npeople/ \"Goodbye HR, hello \u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport\")\n\n**PROMOTED |** How far are you in your HR to People journey?

by\nDeloitte's David Mallon\n\n![saved icon](/themes/custom/diginomica_theme/images/saved-icon.png) Read\nlater\n\n![Profile picture for user\njmilne](/sites/default/files/styles/user_avatar/public/default_images/default-\navatar.png?itok=YN7Ae8CQ) By [Janine Milne](/author/jmilne \"View user\nprofile.\") November 18, 2019\n\nSummary:\n\n     HR analytics needs to escape HR if it\u2019s to be truly useful.  \n\n__\n\n![Bersin by Deloitte\n](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2019-11/Screenshot%202019-11-18%20at%2020.16.40.png?itok=T4dNwEbr)\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe irony about HR analytics, according to David Mallon, Vice President and\nChief Analyst at Bersin by Deloitte, is that it really shouldn\u2019t limited to HR\npersonnel. People data needs to be out in the field and used by managers who\ndaily need to make decisions about their teams:\n\n> The single biggest trend is the value of all this being something that is\n> being used by the supervisor and the employee rather than just HR. More\n> companies are trying to put dashboards in the hands of team leaders, so they\n> can see both the performance and business data - the widget-making or sales\n> - and the people data\n\nNot only would front-line managers have details of sales and operational data,\nbut also training, development, sentiment, engagement and retention and other\npeople data, argues Mallon:\n\n> It gives supervisors a calibrated view of the health of the team, so that\n> day to day they can make better decisions about their team. That is the\n> future of all this [people analytics].\n\nBut for this to happen requires a shift in mindset by HR professionals.\nInstead of looking for systems that only give HR people the data they need to\nhave better conversations with business stakeholders, they must also think\nabout what team leaders throughout the business need. They must decide what\nthey put in the hands of managers or even individual workers themselves that\ncan help them draw their own conclusions.\n\nWhile Mallon is clear that people data needs to be with the masses rather than\nthe few in the HR department, the decision about which solution to choose is\nless clear-cut - analytics buyers are simply spoilt for choice.\n\nThere is a host of pureplay analytics vendors to choose between. Equally,\nthere are many HR platforms, such as talent acquisition or application\ntracking systems, which have analytics capabilities embedded.\n\nThere\u2019s also an explosion of point solutions tackling specific problems, such\nas network or relationship analytics, looking at communication flows,\norganizational network analysis and how you might look at the networks in the\norganizations to improve the business.\n\n## Big deal\n\nPeople analytics is not a single thing. It\u2019s on a spectrum from companies\nsimply reporting to the holy grail of prescriptive analytics and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), says Mallon:\n\n> Vendors in the recruiting world are probably the ones who\u2019ve gone the\n> farthest and fastest at putting both traditional reporting automation\n> technologies as well as more bleeding edge, cognitive, aritificial\n> intelligence and so on into their platforms.\n\nSome vendors are very good about helping companies with this and are not just\npurveyors of technology, but sources of extending the capabilities of your in-\nhouse team. Others take a more DIY approach, handing over the platform and\nleaving it for customers to decide what they do with it.\n\nDecisions about which people analytics platform to buy need to be based not\nonly on the capabilities of the software, but the capabilities and mindset of\nthe managers, he adds:\n\n> You may have a C-suite that\u2019s cutting edge and using data all the time and\n> have middle managers that don\u2019t quite know what to do with it and who make\n> decisions based on experience and relationships.\n\nThe democratization of HR data is part of a wider trend for employees to\nbecome more data driven, says Mallon:\n\n> One of the things we see in our research is this notion of overall data\n> literacy\u2026.Everyone in the HR function and more broadliy everyone in today\u2019s\n> companies shouldn\u2019t be entirely put off by a chart.\n\nData-driven decisions need to take place broadly across the company and not\njust in finance or sales or other pockets of the business.\n\nWhichever flavour of analytics companies choose, it\u2019s essential to have an\noverall data governance strategy:\n\n> You have to have a sense of what data you have, where do you get that data\n> from how do you ensure it\u2019s as clean and up to date and viable as possible.\n\nKeeping on top of data privacy and regulatory considerations of where the data\nresides, who owns it and how it\u2019s being used are key, but most important is\nthe ethics.\n\nMallon suggests thinking of it as a Venn diagram of you could do and things\nyou should do right and looking at where they overlap. New tools will give you\ngreater insights, but you need to think of the implications of that data and\nbe clear about how you are using data to drive impact rather than be driven by\nthe data. Otherwise, observes Mallon:\n\n> You could get yourself in trouble even with the best of intentions.\n\n_Image credit - Bersin_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  * [HCM and the digital future of

People\nAnalytics](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/s1prbpwb9em3mqxllrj8xa.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * HR should be a more intentional translator of workplace data\n  * Focus on performance-predicting metrics over general performance reviews\n  * Data analytics need specific, defined outcomes\n\nIt's the age of data -- and data analytics is revolutionizing HR.\n\nAccenture calculated that there is $3.1 trillion in U.S. revenue opportunity\nfor large publicly listed companies from new sources of digitally available\nworkplace data.\n\nBut is HR prepared to optimize this opportunity?\n\nHR has long been seen as the custodian of \"hard\" data, such as cost of\nemployment, cost of turnover, absenteeism, labor costs and the like. All of\nthis information is critical, but it's a lagging indicator of performance and\nproductivity. By the time the numbers are in, it's too late to change the\nstrategy.\n\nHR can be -- and should be -- a more intentional translator of leading-\nindicator workforce data. To do that, CHROs must drive core people analytics\nharder, particularly concerning strategic performance and talent management.\nFor strategic HR organizations, the days of data maintenance are over.\n\nCHROs must drive core people analytics harder, particularly concerning\nstrategic performance and talent management.\n\n### Fully Leverage Leading Indicators of Performance\n\nStrategic analysis requires leading indicators and the ability to curate,\nsynthesize and analyze that data. HR also requires the authority to enact real\norganizational changes as a result of their performance analysis. But to do\nany of that, HR needs very specific data.\n\nFor instance, [according to Gallup\nresearch](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-\nmanagement.aspx), only 29% of employees strongly agree that their performance\nreviews are fair and 26% strongly agree that they are accurate. Fewer yet say\nthey're managed in a way that [motivates them to do outstanding\nwork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231659/performance-measures-motivate-\nmadden-employees.aspx). Those granular details add up to organization-level\nperformance and growth issues.\n\nHR should know the percentages of each of those metrics in their\norganizations. Those data explain factors -- such as employee engagement,\ntalent performance, turnover drivers, etc. -- that predict performance,\nhelping leaders understand what can be changed while there is still a chance.\n\nBut there are a lot of ways HR can help leaders to truly leverage the power of\npredictive analytics and accelerate quality decision-making. The key, however,\nis to determine the fewest workforce and performance metrics that provide\nmaximum explanatory power over critical outcomes. In our experience, the\nfollowing steps are essential:\n\n>   1. Audit and organize existing data from multiple sources and years into a\n> single database (workforce, operational and business data).\n>\n>   2. Leverage advanced analytics to determine what metrics are the most\n> reliable, indicative and predictive of critical business outcomes (i.e.,\n> turnover, productivity, sales, profitability) and which have the highest\n> data quality.\n>\n>   3. Use the pared list of workforce metrics to monitor and forecast\n> business performance, inform changes to strategy, and prioritize\n> interventions and change initiatives. Focus these on answering fundamental\n> questions that will help the business drive value. For instance: _How\n> effectively can we predict the quality of talent intake for a specific role\n> based on applicant data? What factors increase the likelihood that top\n> talent will stay with the company and continue to perform?_\n>\n>\n\nLeaders value such strategic analysis, as it helps them make the right\ndecisions. Still, HR needs to get better at using such analytics to tell a\nstory about what drives long-term value for the company (aligned with their\nstrategic purpose) -- rather than narrow, short-term workforce enhancement\ninitiatives based on descriptive analysis alone.\n\n### Disrupt Talent Analytics\n\nConsider, for example, talent management discussions. In our experience, the\ntalent review is one area that has seen regular, consistent abuse. Most\ncompanies have long relied on the nine-box model that classifies talent into\ncategories such as top talent, consistent superstars or solid performers, and\nunderperformers.\n\nNothing wrong with that. But the quality and objectivity of the data are\nconcerning.\n\nTraditionally, a \"high-potential\" employee is rated as such to reflect a set\nof competencies. The employee's manager designates that label, but managers'\nevaluations are frequently riddled with bias. The whole evaluation process\ntakes a few months to complete. After that is an endless wait for executive\ninput and, finally, the creation of the individual development plan. In the\nmeantime, employees have moved on; the developmental input is late or not\nrelevant anymore.\n\nThe long, cumbersome traditional talent review process needs to be disrupted.\nThis starts with the assessment and analysis of more objective indicators of\npotential. But once an objective review has been completed, HR can move faster\nto translate the assessment insights into real development plans -- especially\nto help managers of top talent use those insights in their [coaching\nconversations](https://courses.gallup.com/workplace/five-conversations-that-\ndrive-performance.html) with every employee on a very regular basis. As it is,\nonly 23% of employees strongly agree that their [manager provides meaningful\nfeedback](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215390/gallup-performance-\nmanagement-ongoing-conversations.aspx) \\-- and making them wait months for\nbiased assessments is a questionable means of improving performance.\n\nThe long, cumbersome traditional talent review process needs to be disrupted.\nThis starts with the assessment and analysis of more objective indicators of\npotential.\n\nGoogle -- a company that bases all of its decisions on hard analytics --\noffers a great example of using data better. Early on, Google's people\nanalytics team came up with an algorithm to refine critical promotion\ndecisions for software engineers.\n\nThe algorithm was used to make an impressive 90% of all promotion decisions.\nBut the engineers wanted greater transparency, and an algorithm wasn't the\nanswer. So, Google discontinued the program. The company knew that people\nshould make people decisions, and analytics merely exists to arm decision-\nmakers with the most reliable insights. In essence, having the right data\nversus having enough data was a critical point to keep in mind.\n\n### Connect Data Analytics to Long-Term Goals\n\nHR's innovative use of predictive data analytics should have clearly defined\noutcomes, as all projects should. But to be maximally useful, those\ndeliverables need to be tied to specific customer, operational and business\noutcomes -- as well as to outcomes at the organizational level such as time to\nmarket, shorter cycle times, rapid product innovation or accelerated quality\nimprovement.\n\nAnd to be genuinely agile, HR must go beyond outcomes to measures of\ncontinuous quality improvement on leading indicators, such as customer and\nemployee engagement metrics and talent and development impact. These are the\nfactors that truly drive business performance.\n\nBacked by objective data and supported by managers in real time, HR could do\nwhat all the analysis in the world can't: lead to predictable, measurable,\nsuccessful outcomes.\n\nTo be blunt, HR has the potential to catalyze disruption into opportunity --\nbut it has to be able to translate people analytics into business decisions\nfirst.\n\n### **Turn the data you have into a competitive advantage.

When talking about\nanalytics, we use many different terms or concepts: scorecards, dashboards,\npredictive analytics, data science, evidence-based decisions, metrics, human\nresource accounting, cloud (or big) data, forecasting, or workforce modeling.\nAt times, all these diverse ideas overwhelm us and actually impair our\nprogress that could come through using analytics. For these ideas to have\nsustainable impact, we must organize them by answering three relatively simple\nquestions.\n\n**Why analytics?**  Analytics is a way to access and use information to make\nbetter decisions. In a digital, connected, and transparent world, people have\nnearly unlimited access to information. In a business setting, we want to turn\nthis ubiquitous information into improved decision making, and that requires\nanalytics. This analytics process is a bit like turning the thousands of words\nin a dictionary (information) into a well-worded, cohesive story or essay with\nreal impact (sound decisions). Thanks to work by Dick Beatty, we have seen\ndecision making through analytics start with a focus on an HR scorecard and\nevolve into insights, then intervention, then business impact. Without\nanalytics, unlimited information is fruitless in improving decisions and\nactions. HR professionals wisely invest their budget, time, and energy on\nanalytics because they can improve decision making.\n\n**What analytics?  **In our research (see Victory Through Organization), we\nhave found that HR analytics--that is focused on assessing only HR work\nthrough HR scorecards--has only moderate impact on both customer and investor\noutcomes and business results. In fact, the book my colleagues and I published\nin 2001 ( _HR Scorecard_ ) would be out of date today. HR professionals should\nfocus less on measuring HR and more on analytical tools and methodologies that\nhave business impact (e.g., predictive modeling, statistical insights).\nBusiness impact comes from focusing on the results or value created from an HR\nactivity.\n\nIn a recent seminar, I asked HR participants to write what they wanted to\nlearn from the workshop. Their answers centered around HR practices (e.g.,\nsuccession planning, career management, agile talent, workforce planning,\nculture change, leadership development, and so forth). Many wanted \"analytics\"\nabout these HR practice areas. To probe for impact, I asked them to fill in\nthe phrase after \"so that . . . \" behind each desired learning. The \"so that .\n. . \" query required them to think of the impact of the HR activity on\nstakeholders outside the boundaries of the organization (customers or\ninvestors). This shifted the analytics focus from activity to impact.\n\n> See Related:  [Leveraging Social\n> Capital](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-\n> analytics/columns/leveraging-social-capital)\n\nAnalytics without impact is a like writing a story or essay without an\naudience. The story or essay may have good words and even sentences and plot\nline, but unless targeted to an audience, it lacks purpose and impact.\nLikewise, HR analytics needs to provide information that has impact by\nfocusing on key business stakeholders. As HR analytics moves beyond scorecards\non HR practices and insights from big data to real business impact, the\ninformation is more focused on improving the business.\n\nFor example, measuring employee engagement moves to impact when it is linked\nto customer engagement and financial results. Too often, some of the\nenthusiasm for employee experience is about the experience and not the real\nvalue: the impact of this experience on key stakeholders such as customers and\ninvestors. This logic for all HR practices is shown in the following figure.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/dave_ulrich_analytics_assessment_1.png)\n\n**How analytics?  **If analytics matters (why) and links to business impact\n(what), the challenge is to make analytics happen (how). My colleagues and\nIhave worked with dozens of companies endeavoring to create analytics\ncapability that delivers business value. Often the desire to perform analytics\nfor decision making with impact lacks focus because so many things to measure\nand actions to take make knowing where to start unclear. As we have worked to\nimplement analytics for impact, we have identified ten actions or criteria HR\nprofessionals could take to assess their HR analytics. These ten criteria and\nactions help HR professionals focus on a starting point and know how to move\nforward with analytics work. While a total score over 70 indicates a good\nanalytics capability, this assessment can also help HR professionals identify\nspecific actions that could improve their organization's analytics capability.\n\n**Assessment of HR Analytics Efforts**\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/dave_ulrich_analytics_assessment_2.png)\n\nObviously, information-rich decisions are more likely to be effective than\ninformation-poor decisions, but navigating the firehose of knowledge available\nrequires analytics. And knowing how to use the right analytics to turn\ninformation into improved decision making comes from answering the why, what,\nand how questions of analytics. The how question is certainly difficult to\nanswer for each organization with all the ways of talking about analytics. So\nthe ten-item assessment helps HR professionals determine their overall\nanalytics capability and identify improvement areas to truly make better\ndecisions and enhance business results.\n\nSo, what analytics do you do on your HR analytics?\n\n**_Dave Ulrich_** _  is the Rensis Likert Professor at the Ross School of\nBusiness, University of Michigan and a partner at The RBL Group, a consulting\nfirm focused on helping organizations and leaders deliver value._\n\n\n\n_Article republished with permission.

So much in fact, it's getting harder and harder to see the\nboundaries between the two topics.  It would even be fair to say they two,\ndata and human resources, are forever linked.  In the last decade, there have\nbeen huge advancements.  Take data gathring for instance.  HR continues to\ngather information through annual employee engagement surveys, but also\nthrough social media and in-house employee platforms.  Additionally, with the\nhelp of artificial intelligence, data is being pulled in an automated-fashion\nfrom candidate resumes.\n\nThere have also been advancements in analysis.\n\nHR professionals are becoming more data literate and proficient.  They are\nable to look at data and, from it, tell the employee 'story'.  There are also\nseveral vendor-led solutions that provide a technology component to analysis.\nAs with data gathering, some vendors are offering an artificial intelligence-\npowered platform to pinpoint specific variables or trends.\n\nData is being using to formulate strategies around recruitment, internal\nemployee networks and retention as well as learning.  It's even being used to\ndetermine which employees are at a risk for leaving the organization and to\npre-determine which positions will likely be open in the coming weeks and\nmonths.  For the first time in HR history, human resources professionals can,\nin some small way, predict the future of the workplace.\n\nData is almost the proverbial 'crystal ball'.\n\nThe HR Exchange Network has written a plethora of articles on these topics and\nhas shared just as many from contributors and thought leaders around the\nworld.  As we move into 2020, here are the Top 10 HR Data Articles of 2019.\n\n# Best of HR Data\n\n**1\\. Leveraging Social Capital**\n\n\"There should be little doubt that human capital is a firm's greatest asset.\"\nBut General Motors chief talent officer Michael Arena says companies have to\ndo more such as making sure employees are in the right place to be successful.\nIt's not enough for HR to bring in the best people.  Companies also have to\nbring out the best in people.  That requires HR to \"intentionally leverage\nsocial capital.\"  In his latest contribution to the HR Exchange Network, Arena\nexplains why organizations need to \"deliberately focus on unleashing the\nlatent potential of the talent that they already employ.\"  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/leveraging-\nsocial-capital) to read more.\n\n**2.** **Network Energy is the New Employee Engagement**\n\nDisengaged employees are more likely to quit than those that are engaged.  In\nhis latest article for the HR Exchange Network, Amazon Web Services VP of\nTalent and Development Michael Arena says employee engagement, today, is\n\"lagging measurement of something much more immediate, network energy!\"  If\nyou're unfamiliar with the term, network energy specifically refers to the\nlinkages between employees on any given team.  For more information on this\nand how to leverage positive energy to the betterment of the employee, team\nand company, [click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-\nanalytics/columns/network-energy-is-the-new-employee-engagement).\n\n**3\\. Why Relationships are The Next Great Advancement in People Analytics**\n\nHR loves data.  That isn't going to change anytime soon.  Data is the key to\nmeasuring ROI, but also predicting outcomes of certain situations and even\npredicting, for instance, when a person might leave their job and when to\nstart hiring for that \"soon-to-be-open\" position.  Knowing that, Visier Chief\nStrategy Officer Dave Weisbeck says there are four key changes every HR\nprofessional \"needs to understand and start measuring - to help their\norganizations.\"  Weisbeck says that includes outcomes replacing rules and\norders and continuous change, just to name a few.  For more details, [click\nhere](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/why-relationships-\nare-the-next-great-advancement-in-people-analytics/).\n\n**4\\. How to help HR improve its literacy in data and people analytics**\n\nData-based decision making is a rising focus for the HR professional.  So much\nso, there is a lot of attention being placed on creating a culture that\nsupports that type of decision making.  In their article, Patrick Coolen, Jaap\nVeldkamp, Ingrid Bienefelt and Martijn Vosz discuss a training exercise\nconducted at ABN AMRO to help HR professionals further their understanding of\npeople analytics by improving their data literacy.  [Click\nhere](https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2019/1/9/how-to-improve-hrs-data-\nliteracy) for more.\n\n**5.** **Diversity at the Core of the Network**\n\nDiversity is critical to the development of resilience in organizations and\n[bottom-line results across time](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\naquisition/news/diversity-and-inclusion-the-business-case).  In his latest\npiece for the HR Exchange Network, Amazon Web Services VP of Talent and\nDevelopment Michael Arena uses data science to prove his case, specifically\npointing to a real-life example.  He mapped out a network of nearly 500\nindividuals within a large service-based organization that needed to be highly\nadaptive. What he found will surprise you.  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/diversity-at-\nthe-core-of-the-network) to read more about the case and his findings.\n\n**6\\. Big HR Data Is Here: How Do You Use It?**\n\nWhen it comes to the use of data, HR gets a little squirmy.  Data can be very\nintimidating, especially if it's not something the HR professional is used to\nusing.  In her inaugural article on the HR Exchange Network, Novant Health VP\nof HR Operations Vaso Perimenis explains not only how big data is of value to\nHR, but also how to build the analytics capability from the ground up.\nPerimenis provides step-by-step instructions on the process and provides\ndetails about each step.  Read her [article\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/big-data-is-\nhere-how-do-you-use-it).\n\n**7\\. GDPR Compliance: Tips and Myths**\n\nIf a company is global, the likelihood is high that it has and will continue\nto come in contact with the European Union's General Data Protection\nRegulation, or GDPR.  Companies headquartered in the EU spent a considerable\nabout of time preparing for the new regulation before it went into effect in\nMay of 2018.  Many are still working to meet compliance today.  But the\nregulation, while specifically applying to companies in the EU, also impacts\ncompanies outside the EU.  If a company in the United States, for instance,\nemploys workers in an EU country they are required to follow the GDPR.  That\nmeans the company's HR department is going to have to be GDPR compliant.\nFailing to do so will result in fines.  So, how do companies outside of the EU\nwork to become GDPR compliant?  [This\narticle](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employment-law/articles/gdpr-\ncompliance-tips-and-myths) answers that question.\n\n**8.** **Assessing your HR Analytics Capability**\n\nHR loves data.  So much so, analytics has become quite the buzzword across HR\ndepartments globally.  But with so many different concepts involved, the noise\naround analytics in HR can be quite deafening.  Human resources thought leader\nDave Ulrich, in his latest piece, explains what analytics actually is and why\nHR wants to pursue it as a strategy.  He also explains some of the key points\nof data HR wants to look at and use.  In the end, Ulrich provides a way for HR\nto assess its own analytics efforts.  Read more\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/assessing-\nyour-hr-analytics-capability).\n\n**9.** **Why Human Resources and Analytics make a Great Team**\n\nIn his piece for Associations Now, Ernie Smith says there is growing evidence\nthat human resources departments benefit from analytics more than any other\ndepartment within a company.  Smith quotes a report from Oracle which says HR\nhas \"quickly leapfrogged into one of the most valuable departments for\ncorporate analytics\", faster than other departments such as finance.  More can\nbe found [here](https://associationsnow.com/2019/04/why-human-resources-and-\nanalytics-make-a-great-team/).\n\n**10.** **Blockchain Realities in Recruitment**\n\nEvery HR professional tasked with finding the best talent for their companies\nis looking for tools to aid them in the charge.  Some are turning to AI.\nOthers are employing a change in their benefits strategy that makes the\ncompany more attractive to job candidates.  Of course, those are just some of\nthe more popular ones.  Then there are those options that are more \"pie in the\nsky\" concepts, at least that's what they seem to be at the moment.  Among\nthem:  blockchain.  Read more [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntalent-aquisition/articles/blockchain-realities-in-recruitment).\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

Here\u2019s an update on the company, its newest additions to the product line and its competitive standing. \n\n__\n\n![HR](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2019-02/HR.jpg?itok=Qfw5q61F)\n\nSeven years ago, [I wrote about Visier](https://www.zdnet.com/article/future-\nof-management-science-erp-and-decision-making/). The company was very new then\nand I liked the way they did original/primary research to understand the kinds\nof questions businesses had re: people and how companies were trying to solve\nthem then. It\u2019s from that research that Visier defined the kinds of data\nneeded to answer those questions.\n\nThat approach was (and still is) a very good one. Many ERP/HR vendors\n(incorrectly) assume that you can get great analytic results from a simple\nparsing of transaction data within an HR system. That\u2019s like trying to\nunderstand your competitor\u2019s business strategy from analyzing your internal\naccounting transaction data. Like a blind pig, you might find the odd acorn.\nHowever, some of the best sources for insights might come from external data\nsources or combinations of internal and external data stores. That was\nVisier\u2019s initial insight.\n\nNow, [Visier](http://www.visier.com) is the big dog in HR analytics.\n\n## Visier\u2019s growth\n\n[According to Visier](https://www.visier.com/press-release/visier-recognized-\nfor-rapid-growth-by-deloittes-technology-fast-50-and-fast-500/), the company:\n\n  * _\u201cachieved a compound annual growth rate of 120 percent and increasing customer subscriptions to surpass $125 million in sales.\u201d_\n  * _\u201csurpassed $125M USD in subscription sales (2018)\u201d_\n  * grew _\u201cheadcount twofold in 2018 and now stands around 420 employee equivalents\u201d_\n  * experienced _\u201c679 percent in revenue growth from 2014 to 2017_.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s last capital raise was in 2017. To date, the company has raised\n$94.5 million in four rounds. It would appear that the company is in that rare\ncloud space where it is close to meeting [Rule of\n40](https://diginomica.com/cornerstone-ondemand-case-study-saas-vendor-\nmaturation) requirements (i.e., CAGR plus net margin = 40 points total). It\u2019s\norganically growing AND close to throwing off enough cash flow to fund on-\ngoing operations/new sales efforts.\n\n## Visier People\n\nVisier People is the name of Visier\u2019s product line. The solution is in use at\nover 150 enterprises and has some 50,000 users (an average of approx. 400\nusers per customer).\n\nVisier has expended a lot of energy over the years to make implementations\nfaster and faster. The value customers get from advanced HR analytics comes\nfrom timely workforce insights not from inordinately long and costly\nimplementations.\n\nVisier can actually deliver insights to more than just giant-sized companies\nas they\u2019ve already anticipated many of the needed metrics and likely\nintegrations that are required. Pre-built integrations, dashboards, etc. also\nshorten implementation times. Likewise, providing tools that scrub/clean a\ncustomer\u2019s data also speed up implementations and value delivery.\n\nConnecting insights to actions is the current frontier for many analytic\nsolutions. Often these involve connecting workflow and exception handling\ntechnology to the machine learning/AI analytic technology. The best solutions\nare integrated with core HR software products, enterprise collaboration tools\nand other technologies.\n\nVisier People is focused on five main analysis areas: Planning, Talent, Talent\nAcquisition, Learning and ad-hoc analytics. Visier\u2019s integration technology\nconnects HR data to other internal non-HR data sources (e.g., internal systems\nlike Financials, Operations/Manufacturing, Sales/Marketing, etc.) and to\nexternal data stores.\n\nUsers can only see data they are permitted to view. If the core HR system has\nfield level security, Visier maintains this.\n\nVisier People is a multi-tenant cloud product. Data is maintained in a multi-\ndimensional, in-memory database. Visier graphics/analytics are also available\non mobile devices.\n\nVisier now has new what-if capabilities to supplement its analytics. It can\nalso run a variety of analytics involving labor costs. Visier has also\ndeveloped a number of benchmarks that are drawn from the aggregated (but\nanonymized) data across its installed base. That database includes data from\nover 7 million workers.\n\n## Visier\u2019s new Diversity & Inclusions solution\n\nIn the last few weeks, Visier has announced its new Diversity and Inclusion\nanalytics offering. According to Visier, this solution _\u201c_ _enables leaders to\nidentify opportunities and risks and make informed decisions toward achieving\ntheir organization\u2019s D &I goals.\u201d_ Inclusion and diversity initiatives are a\nbig deal today as too many companies aren\u2019t winning their war for talent and\nboards of directors aren\u2019t tolerating executives that are (needlessly)\ndiscriminating against women, older people, people of color, etc.\n\nVisier says its solution:\n\n  * provides stats and data regarding hiring trends, workforce composition, turnover and more\n  * compares the organization\u2019s D&I performance to industry benchmarks\n\nVisier\u2019s solution may be utilizing some of TrustSphere\u2019s ONA (organizational\nnetwork analysis) data. For more on this, [click\nhere](https://www.trustsphere.com/visier-announces-ona-data-partnership-with-\ntrustsphere/).\n\n## Visier and Insperity\n\nVisier also cut a deal with [Insperity](http://www.insperity.com), a full-\nservice HR provider (and a firm headquartered just a couple of miles from my\nhome). Visier\u2019s analytics will be available on Insperity\u2019s HR platform.\nAccording to Visier CEO John Schwarz:\n\n> _Visier has long delivered the leading people analytics solution for the\n> Global 2000 enterprise class. With this partnership with Insperity, we have\n> extended the value of people analytics to mid-market organizations._\n\nThis deal opens up Visier to the mid-market \u2013 a space that many analytic\nproviders have avoided as many mid-market firms have champagne tastes but beer\nbudgets. Many analytic solutions have been too costly for many mid-market\nbuyers to consider. Visier\u2019s focus on making solutions more cost-effective and\nfaster to implement should serve them (and Insperity) well in this market\ndemographic.\n\nThe full rollout of this relationship is scheduled for later in the year.\n\n## Visier\u2019s value proposition\n\nJust last week, Visier announced some findings from a recent research\ninitiative. The research looked at the effect customers were seeing after\nusing Visier\u2019s analytics. The research focused on a number of large employers.\nOne key finding stated:\n\n> _Not only have Visier customers beat the market in retaining talent overall\n> by 3.5%, but they had experienced a reduction in manager turnover by a\n> combined 17%, resulting in millions of dollars of cost savings._\n\nThe full report can be [found here](https://hello.visier.com/people-analytics-\ndrives-manager-turnover-reduction/).\n\n## My take\n\nI like what Visier has been doing these years. Their employees appear jazzed\nabout the company and what they offer to customers. Customer retention also\nseems strong. If there are headwinds, they\u2019ll principally come from HRMS/HCM\ncompetitors.\n\nCompetition in the HR analytics space is only going to intensify. Most every\nHRMS/HCM vendor has something analytic to show potential buyers these days.\nHowever, many of these newer analytic apps:\n\n  * are not fully available yet;\n  * have a limited useful range;\n  * require a lot of work to implement;\n  * take vendors a very long time to develop; and/or,\n  * are heavily dependent on the data within the HCM suite\n\nWhere some HRMS/HCM vendors are taking their (nascent) HR analytics is to add\nworkflow and exception handing. This makes the analytics \u201cactionable\u201d.\nAdditionally, other innovative technologies (e.g., machine learning, AI, bots,\netc.) are being married to these analytics.\n\nVisier\u2019s early mover advantage has served them well but it will need to\ncontinue to out-innovate its large HRMS peers to remain relevant.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed how ERP firms want into this space. SAP\u2019s acquisition of\nQualtrics in late 2018/early 2019 has one interesting component around the\nemployee experience. [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/qualtrics-\nipo-s-1-breakdown-a84dd5355361) reports that one part of Qualtrics is clearly\ntargeting HR analytics:\n\n> _Employee Experience (EX): Allows managers and employees to identify gaps in\n> the employee experience from recruiting and onboarding to performance\n> management in order to improve employee engagement, raise productivity, and\n> limit attrition._\n\nCompetition is definitely there for Visier.\n\nSo, the longer-term strategic question for Visier is this: Does Visier get\nrolled into a major HRMS/HCM product line or does Visier extend its\norganizational and product line reach into more operational areas? If it\nchooses the former, it may lose some of its entrepreneurial spunk inside a\nlarger firm. If it chooses the latter, it will be up against a new crop of\ncompetitors like [Aera](http://www.aeratechnology.com) and\n[Uptake](http://www.uptake.com).\n\nFor now, Visier can enjoy its leadership role. And while it does, it should\ngrab all the mid-market and large enterprise market share it can. We can then\nwatch its competitors try to catch them. That should be interesting to watch\u2026.\n\n_Image credit - Freeimages.com/Svilen Milev_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  * [HCM and the digital future of work](/category/hcm-hr-future-work)\n  *

human resources continues to move into the future and professionals take a\nserious look at their people, one thing is certain:  the need for high\nperforming talent is the greatest it's ever been in the history of business.\nIt's for that reason leveraging data in human resources is paramount to\nsuccess.  Growth is linked to the data function and its existence across all\ndimensions of HR from talent acquisition to retention.\n\n# People Analytics\n\n## The Stats\n\nAccording to Deloitte's Human Capital Trends report, 71% of companies see\npeople analytics as a high priority, but only 9% believe they have a good\nunderstanding of which talent dimension drives performance in their companies.\n\nWhy is data so important?\n\n\"Organizations today realized that good HR practices are no longer enough as\nwe need a more data driven approach which can lead to evidence based HR, thus\nreducing human bias and subjectivity. When HR is able to make impact through\nanalytics, they take on a more strategic role and are able to help their\norganizations gain a competitive advantage through clever use of data,\" Jaclyn\nLee said.  She's the Chief Human Resources Officer for the Singapore\nUniversity of Technology and Design.\n\n> RELATED:  [People Analytics - Where Do We\n> Begin?](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/people-\n> analytics-where-do-we-begin)\n\n\"Analytics,\" she continued, \"also have a huge potential to increase return on\ninvestment when the numbers are tied to business outcomes and when predictions\npoint to a range of possibilities that companies can plan for.\"\n\nSo, how are companies driving growth with [people\nanalytics](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/articles/data-\nthat-generates-discovery)?\n\n### Talent Acquisition\n\nLinkedIn[0](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/recruiting-\nstrategy/2016/how-building-out-a-talent-analytics-function-saved-linkedin-\nrecruiting-considerable-time-and-\nmoney?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=946764&utm_campaign=0&_ga=2.87586776.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130)\nprovides a fair share of resources to the HR professional, but it is also\ncompany in need of solutions.  The social media platform for professionals has\nbeen faced with a great demand for its services, but not enough manpower to\nprovide those services.  At one point, the company was growing at 40% every\nyear and the talent acquisition team was struggling to accurately forecast the\nnumber of hires needed to address the demands on the company.\n\nThat's when they employed people analytics as part of their solution.  In just\none year, LinkedIn was able to predict hires within 5% of its actual hires.\nThat translated into money saved for the social media giant.  Also in that\nfirst year, the company saved 15% of its recruiting budget.\n\n### ISS and Employee Engagement\n\nISS[1](http://www.publications.issworld.com/ISS/External/issworld/White_papers/LinkingEmployeeandCustomerEngagement/?_ga=2.50927721.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130)\nhas more than 510,000 employees across the globe, and the facilities company\nhad a problem.  Leaders wanted to know if it was possible to improve the\ncustomer experience and increase profits through higher employee engagement.\nTo figure out a solution, ISS used people analytics to:\n\n  1. Analyze the link strength between employee engagement, customer satisfaction and profitability\n  2. Analyze data to identify HR processes that would have the biggest impact on improving employee engagement and customer experience, focusing on motivation, service quality, knowledge and responsiveness of service staff as key drivers.\n\nIn the process, ISS also found a strong link between high customer Net\nPromoter scores and contract profitability.\n\n> WEBINAR:  [Data for Dummies - How to Apply Data to\n> Learning](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/webinars/data-\n> for-dummies-how-to-apply-data-to-learning)\n\nOnce the company had its findings, it changed its training programs for\nsupervisors and employees as well as onboarding programs.\n\n### Retention\n\nOne of the most common problems solved via the use of people analytics is\nattrition.  Why?  It's relatively easy to create a business case and\ndemonstrate ROI.\n\nA solid example is provided by IBM[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-\nanalytics-interviews-1-anshul-sheopuri-ibm-david-green/?trk=mp-author-\ncard&_ga=2.86078680.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130).  The tech\ncompany employs a program called Proactive Retention.  Through use of\nanalytics, the company is able to predict which employees are likely to leave.\nIt is also able to pinpoint the best way to retain employees.  The program\nitself has helped the company save more than $270 million dollars since its\ninceptions.\n\nAnother example would be\nNielsen[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3S1bUhK3Fo&_ga=2.57695082.1755913512.1536161130-1359123678.1536161130).\nWith the use of people analytics, the company has been able to calculate that\na single percentage point of attrition represents $5 million lost by the\ncompany.  So, how did they mitigate that significant loss of money?  The\nanswer is lateral moves.  The company looked at employees who had made lateral\nmoves versus those that remained in the same position for a long period of\ntime.  The data indicated those that made lateral moves were 48% more likely\nto remain with the company than those who had made no moves.\n\nAs a result, the company put the focus on lateral moves and gained buy-in from\nthe CEO.  Before doing so, only about 4% of employees had made lateral moves\nat the company.  Following that up, Nielsen created a program called Ready to\nRotate.  It empowers employees to self-advocate their desires to take on new\nchallenges within the company.  Within the first six months, the company saw a\n160% increase in traffic to the Ready to Rotate website.  The net result:\nthey saw the voluntary attrition rate for Q1 decrease by nearly half for the\nsame timeframe for the previous year.\n\n### Performance\n\nData and the analysis around it can be used for more than finding problems and\npreventing them.  It can also be used to help encourage productivity and\neffectiveness at the employee and team levels.  We're talking about people\ncentric analytics now.\n\nA great example of this is technology company Cisco.\n\nAt one point in time, Cisco conducted annual employee engagement surveys.\nSome 73,000 employees respond.  And it took time to analyze all of that data,\nshare it and then implement action plans based on the findings.  In recent\nyears, the company decided to shift its focus from the company altogether down\nto the team level.  This would allow them to get more useful feedback that\ncould be turned into action almost immediately.\n\nCisco also conducts pulse surveys.  The HR team then analyzes this data to\nmeasure team performance and leader interactions with their teams.  This\nfrequent analytical review provides leaders with data that links to key\nperformance indicators, leading to paths of improved performance.\n\nRoxanne Bisby Davis is the director of team analytics and research.\n\n\"We're not looking at it from the perspective of 'Who's performing badly?'\nRather, we're looking at who's great to see what they're doing and how they're\ndoing it, whether it's team members or leaders. By highlighting 'goodness,' it\ngives the teams opportunities to say, 'I really like that approach. Let's try\nit.'\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPeople analytics is not a substitute for strategy or critical thinking.  It\nis, however, another tool in the HR professional's tool box.  With the right\nmeasurements in place, companies can use data to improve and grow the business\non every level from talent acquisition to performance.\n\n> NEXT:  [Finding the Bridge

This Morning](https://www.inc.com/newsletter), a daily\nnews digest curated for those passionate about entrepreneurship._\n\nYou've probably heard the term \"people analytics\" before. Still, if I were to\nask how your company uses them _right now_ , the odds are good that you'd say:\n\"We don't.\"\n\nThat's [according to a study](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/linkedin-just-\nrevealed-results-of-its-2020-global-talent-trends-report-there-are-some-big-\nsurprises.html) published Wednesday by LinkedIn, which surveyed 7,089 talent\nprofessionals and hiring managers last fall on a wide range of topics. The\nstudy spotlights people analytics as one of four major talent trends to watch\nin 2020--which is interesting because 55 percent of surveyed talent\nprofessionals also said they \"still need help putting basic people analytics\ninto practice.\"\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the term, here's a quick definition: People\nanalytics basically means using data to bolster your HR department's ability\nto consistently recruit, hire, and retain great employees. The LinkedIn survey\nnotes that many companies--68 percent of those surveyed--use data to measure\nemployee performance, which is a great starting point. But, it adds, a\ndistinct minority of companies currently use analytics to identify flight\nrisks within their ranks, reduce bias in hiring and promotions, predict a job\ncandidate's potential success in a role, and so on.\n\nTranslation: There's an opportunity here. Earlier this month, in a story about\nthe biggest changes coming to hiring and jobs in 2020, my colleague Brit Morse\nwrote about [how Salesforce employs people\nanalytics](https://www.inc.com/brit-morse/human-resources-trends-2020-best-of-\ninc.html). It's surprisingly unfancy: The company uses the same kinds of\nemployee surveys that might measure employee performance to help managers\ndetermine who is engaged, has great company-improving ideas, and makes a habit\nof helping co-workers. That same data also helps Salesforce identify employees\nwho are struggling under specific managers, which allows the company to solve\nworkplace disputes before they explode.\n\nIt's probably not an unfamiliar data-gathering strategy for a lot of companies\nand it requires no additional costs, yet Salesforce seems to yield a lot of\nreturn from it. The basic difference here is the ability to analyze the data\nyou get on your people. While the LinkedIn study reports that half of those\nsurveyed said their companies were good at collecting and maintaining some\nform of people analytics data, only 39 percent felt confident analyzing it.\nUsing the data to solve existing problems? Just 37 percent. And using it to\nproactively solve future problems? A mere 29 percent.\n\nIf you have the money to invest in this area, you can. A growing industry has\nemerged around HR data collection and analysis in recent years, featuring\ncompanies like Tableau, Looker, and Twine (which was [a 2019 _Inc._ Rising\nStars honoree](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/twine-human-resources-software-\ndata-metrics-evernote-30-under-30-2019.html)). Otherwise, your solution might\nbe as simple as tweaking your existing processes to learn something new about\nthose who work for you.\n\nYou almost certainly use data to inform your operational decisions on topics\nlike sales, budgeting, and funding. It could be time to apply the same concept\nto your people, too.\n\nPublished on: Jan 23, 2020\n\nMore from

an analytics team to truly impact your\norganization.\n\nBy: [Michael J. O'Brien](https://hrexecutive.com/author/mike-obrien/ \"Posts by\nMichael J. O'Brien\") | August 14, 2019 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1029087644HRTechanalytics700-700x459.jpg)\n\ncolorful big data pattern background\n\nData has been used by companies to drive business strategy and decisions for\ndecades. Analytics has the power to transform how HR functions as a whole, but\nit takes more than just setting up an analytics team to truly impact the\norganization. Here are three upcoming sessions at the HR Tech Conference and\nExpo to get you further down the road to analytics dominance:\n\n#### [**Slash Company Turnover With HCM Analytics Tools, Leadership Actions\nand Manager\nAccountability**](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5167&SessionDateID=184)\n\nPalmer-Donavin, a leading wholesale distributor with 520 employees, began\nexperiencing significant turnover in 2015. Looking for a way to forecast an\nemployee\u2019s intent to leave and quantify the likelihood of an employee becoming\na high performer, it turned to UltiPro's Predictive Analytics Software. It\nthen took inspiration from UltiPro\u2019s Leadership Actions to develop best\npractices to engage and retain its talent, with a top action being to ensure\naccountability among managers to complete the tasks that coach and engage\nemployees. Hear how the company combined analytics tools to cut new-hire\nturnover by 66% compared to the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n#### [**How to Get Started and Rapidly Scale HR Analytics in Your\nOrganization**](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5166&SessionDateID=184)\n\nFor those operating across multiple geographies and with multiple HR systems,\nit\u2019s often difficult to rapidly scale HR analytics projects to have any\nimpact. Panasonic's Lydia Wu will introduce you to a \u201cquick and scrappy guide\nto getting started in analytics.\u201d You\u2019ll learn strategies to enable analytics\nwith technology, connect multiple sources for a holistic view on talent and\nconnect people analytics outcomes to the broader organization to rapidly scale\nanalytics projects.\n\n#### [**How Squarespace Built and Grew a People Analytics\nTeam**](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5119&SessionDateID=185)\n\nTechnology companies (think Google) were among the first to bring analytics\nwork to the HR space, which spurred the transformation of HR teams from record\nkeepers to strategic partners. This change inspired smaller tech companies to\nnot only build People Analytics teams but to ingrain them in their\norganizations early on. Hear from two key players focused on People Analytics\nat Squarespace on how they got started and how they\u2019ve built the strategic\npartnerships with their business and operations teams to support Squarespace\u2019s\nrapid growth and meet key HR and talent objectives.\n\nMichael J.

Emond](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=148145) and Ellyn Maese\n\n![COVID-19 Strategies and Policies of the World's Largest\nCompanies](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/rfpjezg9o0kd1bqawrhuca.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * New teams are critical for developing policies and providing information\n  * Learn COVID-19 protocols and business contingency plans\n  * Monitor impact and conduct assessments to sustain business function\n\n> _Gallup Managing Director Larry Emond_ _gathered the strategies and policies\n> of 100_ _members of the CHRO Roundtable, an organization that includes the\n> CHROs of more than 650 of the world 's largest companies, for their\n> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in this sampling average\n> $27 billion in revenue with 80,000 employees and most are global\n> organizations. This is what Emond found._\n\n### **Crisis Management Teams**\n\nMost organizations have created crisis management teams, task forces or\ncommittees with a response tailored to specific geographic regions. These task\nforces meet regularly to develop policies and provide information to leaders,\nmanagers and front-line employees regarding COVID-19 awareness, prevention,\nmanagement and hygiene practices.\n\nThese teams are also focused on management protocols and business continuity\nplans to guide current actions and forecast possible responses to future\nevents. In general, their protocols and plans include:\n\n  * developing succession contingencies for all major executives\n  * conducting business using virtual, video or audio capabilities\n  * restricting travel\n  * reducing to business-critical operations only\n  * moving critical operations to unaffected regions\n  * cross-training team members to perform critical functions in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of another team member\n  * documenting business-critical functions, processes or procedures in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of a team member\n  * distributing call center scripts and agent communications\n\nIf an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, many companies have established\nprotocols like these:\n\n  * Require employees to report confirmed cases -- either of self or family member -- of COVID-19 to HR or management. The affected are typically required to stay home for 14 days and/or until cleared by a doctor to return to work with confirmation that there is no diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  * Isolate employees diagnosed at work; immediately disinfect objects they've touched; trace their contact with other employees, customers, and clients; and notify those who may have been exposed without releasing the diagnosed employee's name.\n  * Ask employees to log all contact with other employees or visitors in case they become symptomatic so that others can be informed of potential exposure.\n\n### **Travel Requirements**\n\nMost companies have recommended limiting personal and professional travel, and\nsome have assured workers they could decline professional invitations without\npenalty. Generally called soft bans, these partial travel restrictions have\nbeen issued with requests to inform HR of travel and avoid air travel, public\ntransportation and large gatherings, as well as 14-day self-quarantines\nfollowing travel to affected areas.\n\nHowever, hard bans are in effect in many companies, and travel to China,\nItaly, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan has been prohibited.\nIndeed, most intercontinental travel -- and, more recently, even travel in\ngeneral -- has stopped for the time being, unless it's mission-critical.\n\n### **Business Impact**\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions. Many companies with facilities in\naffected areas have closed them and are canceling their own -- or their\nemployees' presence at -- conferences, events and face-to-face meetings. Some\nhave been able to move operations to unaffected locations.\n\nSimultaneously, CHROs are:\n\n  * monitoring supply chains or providers for potential impacts\n  * conducting ongoing supply chain risk assessment and operation impact assessment\n  * considering alternative suppliers\n  * preparing for shortages, transportation delays or communication delays\n  * approving additional budget for supplies or additional paid time off\n  * reducing or suspending bonuses for top earners\n  * analyzing and forecasting potential market impacts\n\n### **Wellbeing**\n\nCompanies are also assessing risks to their [employees' physical and financial\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-\nwellbeing-high.aspx). Their mitigation efforts include:\n\n  * instituting mandatory work-from-home or [remote work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288956/covid-teams-working-remotely-guide-leaders.aspx) policies where possible\n  * closing on-site facilities such as gyms, cafeterias and common areas\n  * making revisions to employee compensation and benefits policies\n  * granting paid time off for symptomatic employees, employees who must care for family members who are diagnosed with COVID-19, and/or employees with diagnosed cases of COVID-19\n  * using standing sick leave, extended sick leave, vacation time, paid time off or flex-time policies\n  * increasing sick leave or paid time off for all or on a case-by-case basis\n  * utilizing short-term disability, family leave (FMLA) or other existing benefits\n  * recommending available Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n  * reminding employees about mental health services for [stress management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257501/charge-work-stress-starting-managers.aspx)\n  * using back-up care programs, childcare subsidies or other dependent care benefits\n  * refraining from penalizing time off of any kind\n  * permitting unlimited unpaid time off without penalty\n  * providing travel/international SOS (medical and travel security) services\n  * paying for time spent under quarantine\n  * [offering work-from-home options](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/263510/manage-remote-employees.aspx) or adjusting schedules due to school closures\n  * communicating employer-sponsored insurance and other relevant benefits\n  * advising employees to avoid public transportation\n  * staggering shifts to help employees avoid busy commutes\n  * advising employees to avoid visiting high-traffic events or locations on personal time\n  * reconfiguring meeting rooms, break rooms and other common areas to promote social distancing\n  * expanding the time of meal service to avoid congestion, and asking employees to consider alternate meal times to reduce crowds\n\n### **Technology**\n\nThese companies are testing technological (e.g., remote work) capabilities,\nemergency notification systems and updating employee contact information.\nThey're advising employees to take their laptops or other portable equipment\nhome each night, and they are devoting IT staff to help employees set up\nremote connections at home, sometimes on employees' personal computers.\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions.\n\nMany companies have required or are encouraging video or audio-conferencing\nmeetings (e.g., Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) or phone calls in lieu of face-\nto-face meetings. They also recommend conducting collaborative projects by\nvideo or audio-conferencing, Google Docs, emails or other online channels.\n\n### **Communications**\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols. Many are issuing FAQ guides, and many are including\nlinks to authorities and external organizations such as the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), The World Health Organization (WHO),\nJohns Hopkins University, local governments and outbreak maps.\n\nAlong with expert advice, these messages often include a genuinely personal\nelement, i.e., reminding workers to get information from credible\norganizations, assuring them that none of their fellow employees have tested\npositive for the virus (where applicable) and urging employees not to panic or\nspread rumors. They will also often encourage employees to obtain enough food,\nwater, medicines and other essentials for their families in case of quarantine\nor scarcity.\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols.\n\nCommunications are usually tailored to the recipients -- whether leaders,\nmanagers, employees or clients/customers, respectively -- and methods include:\n\n  * social media for public messages\n  * email, mail, text messages, hotlines and internal systems (i.e., intranet) to propagate pertinent information\n  * signage to reinforce hygiene, screening and other organizational policies\n\nMembers of the CHRO Roundtable are conscious of the effects of their\ncommunication, particularly on customers. To that end, many have:\n\n  * Proscribed responses from managers/leaders if contacted by the media. Many have designated media relations personnel who address all questions from the media.\n  * Asked employees not to violate the privacy of diagnosed employees or clients/customers in social media messages.\n  * Deployed social media and marketing messaging about customer policies and alternative commerce/services.\n\n### **Training**\n\nBusinesses are rapidly expanding training opportunities. Much of it concerns\nmanagers, who are being tasked with assisting in coronavirus containment,\nresponding to employee needs or concerns, and communicating disease-management\npolicies and preventative measures, such as hygiene practices. But CHROs are\nalso creating COVID-19-specific training programs for security professionals,\ncleaning crews, maintenance and groundskeeping staff.\n\nThese protocols and responses, we're told, will be operational as long as is\nneeded -- the end of May is the current long-term projection -- and all are\nsubject to revision. Gallup will continue to report on our findings as the\nsituation evolves.\n\n### **Discover these crucial resources to better prepare your company during\nthis disruption:**\n\n  * [Watch our live webinar \"COVID-19: Managing Your Workforce Through Disruption\"](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2227447/9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B?parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy) to get everything Gallup knows about disruption and other crises.\n  * Read about how to [manage the loneliness and isolation of remote workers in this article](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268076/manage-loneliness-isolation-remote-workers.aspx).\n  * Read about \"The Changing Place and Space of Work\" in Gallup's [_State of the American Workplace report_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx), which includes research on remote work trends and best practices.\n\nLarry Emond is Managing Director of Global Leadership Advisory at Gallup.\n\nEllyn Maese is a Research Associate at Gallup.\n\n_Jennifer Robison contributed to this article._\n\n[\n![](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/SPEEDBUMPS/jfrv8v85vegptqw9if7wcw.png)\nDeep Dive  What Is Employee Engagement, Really?

As technology has become more advanced, companies have\ncontinued to automate more processes to reduce administrative tasks (i.e. time\ntracking, payroll, onboarding) and simplify complexities. While they have\nsaved some trees and file cabinet space by automating basic functions, the Big\nData era has inundated users with an overwhelming amount of data.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## Leveraging Analytics to Gain Valuable Insight\n\nThe data stored in an HCM solution is like a gold mine. The challenge is, how\ndo HR teams make the most of all this data? This is where analytics come in to\nplay. By properly leveraging metrics about the business and employees, HR\nteams can accurately interpret outcomes and spot trends across their\norganization, helping them to make better business decisions.\n\nFor the data to be truly valuable to an organization, it is critical to first\nunderstand what business drivers the organization needs to explore to ensure\nthe maximum return on its human capital investments. What insights would prove\nvaluable in effectively managing the organization\u2019s employees to achieve the\ngoals of the business quickly and efficiently? For example, if employee\nturnover is a major factor in a business like it is for many, then the HR team\ncan leverage predictive analytics to take relevant data, chart and map it, and\nthen predict it, resulting in meaningful data to make more informed business\ndecisions.\n\nA trendy term today is \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d (KPIs), which are\nquantifiable values that are what makes the organization tick. They can help\nvalidate the effectiveness of achieving key business objectives. So, going\nback to the employee turnover example, if the HR team is asked by management\nto report monthly on the turnover by location, they would need a tool to help\nidentify the required data and how to capture it on a regular schedule over a\nperiod of time so it can be analyzed and reported. Then, over time, the HR\nteam will be able to spot trends, such as a high turnover under a particular\nmanager or in a certain region, and make necessary changes to improve turnover\nrates and become a more strategic asset to the organization.\n\n![Monthly Turnover Rtw](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Also Read:**[Is Automation and HR Tech Replacing\nHR?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/is-hr-\ntech-replacing-hr-four-impacts-of-automation-in-hr/)\n\n## Generating Meaningful Reports\n\nData is great. Analytics are great. But, not if they are in a format that is\ndifficult to understand or don\u2019t include the exact data elements that are\nneeded for making a specific decision. Sometimes a simple list report is all\nthat is needed to provide the necessary insight. It is important that\norganizations have a HCM solution that enables quick and easy data capture and\nthe ability to deliver that data in a format that is easily understood and\nmeaningful to the recipients.\n\nFurthermore, these reports have to be delivered on a timely basis. If a report\ntakes too long to be developed, it may lose its value. An HCM solution that\nautomates reporting on designated dates will save time and provide actionable\ndata to provide valuable insight.\n\nWith today\u2019s automation, hard-copy reports are becoming a thing of the past.\nHCM solutions are enabling reports to be generated and delivered\nelectronically to the target recipients. And, now, with the growing popularity\nof e-signatures that are incorporated into the reporting workflow, processes\nare being streamlined even further. By electronically signing off on employee\nagreements, benefits statements, onboarding forms, and so much more, the lag\ntime waiting for a signature can be reduced dramatically. If an organization\nis still using manual signatures, this is a ripe opportunity to automate and\nstreamline.\n\n![Monthly KPIs](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n## Visualizing Data to Make it More Actionable\n\nReports can be extremely valuable tools; however, humans process data easier\nwhen it is shown in a graphical format. Data visualization technology is now\nenabling data to be presented in an easy, more engaging way and making it more\nactionable. Therefore, HCM solutions are now offering digital dashboards that\nprovide graphs and charts to enable users to quickly visualize the data that\nis important to them in a way that makes sense to them.\n\nBut, what about the details that reports can offer? With digital dashboards,\nthe data is summarized in a pie chart or graph, and if more data is needed,\nthe user can click on a portion of the chart, for example, and drill down to\nadditional detail. So, if a pie chart shows employee turnover by location,\nusers can click on a portion of the chart to see the details of that specific\nlocation. This ability to see the big picture but then to drill down to the\ndetails enables executives to obtain the information they need while allowing\nmanagers and employees to access the level of detail they need with just\nsimple clicks \u2013 eliminating the need to root through pages of paper to find\nthat one piece of meaningful data.\n\n![Average Turnover](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n## Empowering Users with Valuable Insights\n\nThere is no question that technology today is helping to inform day-to-day\ndecisions and streamline processes. It is important that organizations choose\nthe right tools that will enable them to gather data from across their\nenterprise and then easily present that data in a meaningful way.\n\nBy replacing old reports with actionable data analytics where users can drill\ndown to get more detail, HR teams will be empowered with the insights needed\nto drive decision making and increase organizational effectiveness.\n\n**Also Read:**[4 Ways to Increase Employee Self-Service\nAdoption](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-self-\nservice/4-ways-to-increase-employee-self-service-adoption/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fdata-analytics-and-reporting-drive-insightful-\ndecisions%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Data+Analytics+and+Reporting+Drive+Insightful+Decisions\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Data+Analytics+and+Reporting+Drive+Insightful+Decisions&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fdata-analytics-and-reporting-drive-insightful-\ndecisions%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fdata-analytics-and-reporting-drive-insightful-\ndecisions%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fdata-analytics-and-reporting-drive-insightful-\ndecisions%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Data Analytics and Reporting Drive\nInsightful\nDecisions&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fdata-analytics-and-reporting-drive-insightful-\ndecisions%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

However, more than half are still in need of help developing a data-\nproficient team within their company.\n\nWhile organisations are now beginning to make use of big data to interpret\nworkplace trends and issues, many have remained preoccupied with simply\ncollecting data.\n\n[READ MORE: Are robots better than HR at 'reading'\nemotions?](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/news/general/are-robots-better-than-hr-\nat-reading-emotions/160752)\n\nIn terms of people analytics mastery, most organisations have yet to cross\nover to that stage where they can confidently analyse, act on (or solve\nexisting problems) and - ultimately - capitalise on new opportunities using\nthe numbers and trends emerging from their observations.\n\n\"Providing insights to support better decision-making is the key purpose of\npeople analytics,\" noted David Green, one of the world's leading experts on\npeople analytics, in the report. \"By bringing data to the conversation, you\ncan be more confident about your recommendations.\"\n\n[READ MORE: Big data: Why 82% of HR departments are getting it\nwrong](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/news/general/big-data-why-82-of-hr-\ndepartments-are-getting-it-wrong/125609)\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/ca/specialization/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218773)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218773)\n\n**Focus on a specific problem**  \nFor HR professionals eager to get started in people analytics, the LinkedIn\nstudy recommends launching an analytics pilot that can zero in on a particular\nproblem at their organisation.\n\nThis will enable HR to work with the company's leaders in leveraging people\nanalytics as a problem-solving tool.\n\n\"One idea - identifying reasons for turnover - is a popular objective with\nclear ROI,\" analysts from LinkedIn noted.\n\nFinancial services group Discovery, for example, built its own 'human capital\ndashboard' that monitors attrition and collates other factors, such as the\ncritical skills and demographics of top performers and turnover costs. As a\nresult, the company now has a model that can predict attrition.\n\nOf course, there is a diverse range of HR functions that stand to benefit from\npeople analytics both now and in the next five years. According to\nrespondents, these include:\n\n  * Measuring employee performance (82%)\n  * Strategic workforce planning (77%)\n  * Identifying skills gaps (70%)\n  * Evaluating recruiting channels (67%)\n  * Assessing talent supply/demand (62%)\n  * Identifying flight risks to improve retention (60%)\n  * Reducing bias in hiring/promotions (56%)\n  * Competitive intelligence (55%)\n  * Predicting candidate success (47%)\n  * Organisational network analysis (41%)\n\n[READ MORE: 10 HR tech trends set to disrupt\n2020](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/specialization/hr-technology/10-hr-tech-\ntrends-set-to-disrupt-2020/211254)\n\n**Behavioural science background**  \nBut people analytics isn't only about crunching numbers.\n\nOne unique element of the practice is how it combines the disciplines of data\nscience and behavioural science seamlessly in its interpretation of workforce\ntrends.\n\nDr. Eric Knudsen, who leads people science research at LinkedIn, believes the\ndiscipline of psychology lends credence to the effective practice of HR\nanalytics.\n\n\"We don't always behave rationally, and if we think only about the data, we'll\ndrive right by the motivations and behaviours that cause the patterns we're\nseeing,\" he told HRD.\n\n\"Remember: data is decision support,\" he said. \"Bring theory into the\nconversation, and suddenly many things begin to make a lot more sense.\"\n\nPeople, according to Knudsen, are \"much more complex than the spreadsheets\ntheir data lives in\".\n\n**' Still in its infancy'**  \n\"The best part is, people analytics is still in its infancy as a discipline,\nso there is great opportunity for newcomers to have field-wide impact,\"\nKnudsen noted.\n\n\"If you're interested in getting started, your path may vary depending on\nwhether you're already in HR or not. If you're in HR, work with your peers to\nfind out what talent questions they've always grappled with, and identify what\nbits of information could help you make a decision about how to fix it. You\nmay not have the data you need right away, but instead of throwing your hands\nup (what HR has historically done), build a way to collect that information,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"If you're asking employees for new data, communicate openly about how that\ndata will be used, and promise them you'll return with the insights you\nlearned. Follow through with that promise.\"\n\n**3 practical tips to get started in people analytics**  \nKnudsen's advice: \"Tackle one small problem at first, and make sure your\nleadership hears about it. Then tackle a slightly larger one. Then a larger\none.\"\n\n\"If you're in a completely different discipline to start, the same hands-on\napproach applies more broadly,\" he said.\n\n1) Hone your understanding and start with actual applications of data\nanalysis.\n\n2) In some cases, you may have to go out and find publicly available data and\nplay with it - learn about it and begin training your eye to understand\nmethods and see patterns. You can accelerate your learning by leveraging\npublished and online resources.\n\n3) Do some basic learning in both psychology and statistics.\n\n\"Where there is true interest and passion, we make time to learn,\" Knudsen\nsaid. \"You will find out pretty quickly if this work is right for you.\"\n\nSpeaking of emerging HR technology trends, don't forget to book your ticket to\nHRD's upcoming National HR Summit Australia\n[here](https://hrsummit.com.au/?__hstc=80609928.cbbfb8fcf454509f1a6ad74c600a3a86.1580210907529.1580903483163.1580906317152.11&__hssc=80609928.2.1580906317152&__hsfp=3480816081).\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Canada.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/ca/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219164)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and employees?](/ca/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219164)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/ca/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219158)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/ca/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219158)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637218487352225652.jpg)](/ca/news/general/ultimate-\nsoftware-and-kronos-incorporated-a-merger-like-no-other/219116)\n\n#### [Ultimate Software and Kronos Incorporated: \"A Merger Like No\nOther\"](/ca/news/general/ultimate-software-and-kronos-incorporated-a-merger-\nlike-no-other/219116)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0248_637217768076984792.jpg)](/ca/specialization/employee-\nengagement/why-continuous-development-is-the-cornerstone-of-great-\nleadership/219117)\n\n#### [Why continuous development is the cornerstone of great\nleadership](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/why-continuous-development-\nis-the-cornerstone-of-great-leadership/219117)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n03 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n01 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218773)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/ca/companies)\n  * [People](/ca/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/ca/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/ca/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/ca/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/ca/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/ca/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/ca/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/ca/rss)\n\nWebsite Audited By  [ ![BPA\nWorldwide](/images/BPA_WW_MASTER.png)](https://bpaww.com/bpaww/#?targeturl=/BPAWW/MemberTools/AuditedSiteTraffic&target=2&languageid=1&homepage=/bpaww/Content/MainContent/Home/Index.html&footerpage=/bpaww/content/maincontent/footer/english.htm\n)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HRDCanada/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Canada)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hrmonline)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Analytics Insight Magazine Announces 'The 10 Most Innovative HR Analytics Solution Providers in 2019' -

It\ninvolves research to discover who your customers are, what they need, and\nwhere their pain points lie.\n\nCEM means making changes to the way you do things. And it means continually\nlistening to your customers to find out how well you\u2019re doing and what you can\ndo to keep improving.\n\nThere are a few core principles to understand when you\u2019re getting started with\ncustomer experience. The first is that customer service and customer\nexperience are different things.\n\n  * **Customer experience** includes every interaction your customer has with your brand, including those that happen outside of your channels.\n  * **Customer service** is a subset of customer experience. It\u2019s the way you treat customers when they are in direct contact with you, via text, phone, chat or other forms of communication.\n\nThe next is that customer experience is all about journeys. A customer\u2019s\nexperience isn\u2019t bound by internal divisions like sales vs. service or retail\nvs. trade. It is a sum of many parts, and in most cases you can\u2019t predict\nwhere the customer\u2019s journey will begin or where it will lead.  \n  \nAlong that [customer journey](/customer-journey-mapping), any one point of\nfailure (glitchy website, over-long wait for a chat response) can detract\nhugely from the customer\u2019s experience as a whole. It doesn\u2019t matter if the\ncustomer\u2019s delighted by one part of your business if they\u2019re later\ndisappointed by something else.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to optimize every part of the customer journey and create\nan integrated, consistent omnichannel experience that\u2019s based around your\ncustomer rather than the internal anatomy of your business.\n\nResearch from McKinsey found that [customer satisfaction is 73% more\nlikely](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-\ninsights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience) when entire journeys work well\nthan when individual touchpoints do.\n\n## How to measure, optimize, and scale your customer experience capability\n\nCustomer experience management begins with understanding your customers and\ntheir needs. Your [CRM system](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm) is a\nvaluable tool here as it already contains a record of your interactions with\neach customer to date.\n\nYou can also bring in tools like customer surveys and UX research which can\nhelp you dig deeper and understand your customers\u2019 priorities. Do your target\ncustomers care more about certain things than others? Which of the typical\ncustomer journeys for your business hold the most personal importance for\ncustomers? Where are they most likely to want support, reassurance, or a\ngreater range of options?\n\nCustomer-based research, and the resulting customer experience insights, will\nhelp you to prioritize your CX improvements and work more intuitively on\nexisting projects. It could also help point toward efficiencies and\nimprovements you can make for your company\u2019s own sake, especially where\ncustomer insights provide a birds-eye view across your internal silos.  \n  \nIt\u2019s likely that CX improvements will start small within a company and then\ngrow. Small, successful pilot projects will help generate interest in CX and\nmake the case for wider-scale changes and more ambitious programs.\n\n### A company-wide approach\n\nAs we\u2019ve suggested, there are major rewards to be reaped when companies think\nbig. Make your whole business experience-led and the benefits are likely to\nmultiply accordingly. As an experience-first business, you\u2019re in line for\npositive results on big picture measures like your brand loyalty, plus\nimmediate-return results in terms of sales.\n\n**According to**[US research from PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-\nreleases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html) **:**\n\n  * Consumers will pay up to 16% more for products and services if the experience is great\n  * 1 in 3 will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience\n  * Customers say they\u2019re more likely to try additional services or products when brands provide superior customer experience\n\nMeanwhile, according to [Adobe\u2019s Digital Trends\n2020](https://www.adobe.com/uk/offer/digital-trends-2020.html#): \u201c36% of\ncompanies on the forefront of customer experience said they exceeded their top\nbusiness goal by a significant margin, compared with only 12% of mainstream\ncompanies,\u201d\n\nWhat does that look like in practice? It means that experience isn\u2019t just the\nduty of a single team or department. While it\u2019s important to appoint and\nsupport experience management leaders in your business, they should be setting\ngoals and providing strategies for an entire company\u2019s behavior, not working\nin isolation.\n\n### Changing culture\n\nMaking a commitment to customer-centric ways of doing business is likely to\ninvolve cultural change within your organization. This is likely to be a\nmedium- to long-term endeavor, but there are some changes you can make\nstraight away that will promote CX-friendly ways of working.\n\n### Lead by example\n\nC-suite and leadership have an important role to play in making CX a company\npriority, not only because they\u2019re empowered to make change but because staff\nat all levels naturally look to them to see how to behave. Leaders who walk\nthe talk and put customer experience first can help turn the tide towards\ncustomer-first thinking.\n\n### **Bake CX into your goals and KPIs**\n\nAt team and individual levels you can promote customer-first thinking by\nexplicitly making it a priority in performance management and target-setting.\nNote however that you should prioritize outcomes such as \u201cmake the customer\nfeel heard\u201d rather than behaviors like \u201cchat to every customer\u201d \u2013 authentic\ncustomer connections are more likely to flourish if staff are given some\npersonal input into how they\u2019re achieved.\n\n### **Appoint CX champions**\n\nIt can be helpful to think of CX as a horizontal function, a little like HR or\nIT, vitally connected with every department. Unlike HR or IT though, it can be\nimproved by anyone who is willing and able to step into a customer\u2019s shoes.\nWithin each area of business, try appointing an enthusiastic CX champion who\ncan make suggestions and provide support in making their own part of the\ncompany more customer-centric.\n\n## Setting up a customer experience management system\n\nYour customer management system is a set of tools and processes you can use\ncompany wide to create a continuous cycle of improvement. It\u2019s likely to\ninclude elements you\u2019re already using, with a few new ideas and approaches\nadded to the mix. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting it up and running.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe first step is to decide what success will look like. Think about what you\nwant CX to do for your business and what positive results you want to see.\n\n### Strategy\n\nBased on what you\u2019ve discovered about your current levels of customer loyalty\nand customer satisfaction, identify first priorities. Choose one or more\ncustomer journeys to act as your pilot program.\n\n### Tools\n\nCX improvement is largely a matter of awareness and agility, and this is what\nyour tools need to provide. You need to be able to collect customer feedback\ndata at a number of touchpoints across your customer journey(s) and analyze it\nin a way that allows you to take meaningful, rapid action. You also need to be\nable to circulate those insights within your business in a clear, digestible\nformat.\n\n### Process\n\nChoose where in the customer journey you will collect feedback from your end-\nusers and how you will use it. It\u2019s a given that feedback data should be\nanalyzed to reveal your current performance levels, but you may also want to\nfeed it into parts of your business that can make immediate improvements to\nindividual cases. For example, feedback from a dissatisfied customer could be\nrouted directly to the person responsible for the relevant touchpoint.\n\nWhile having a structured customer experience management model is important,\nit\u2019s worth noting that CX is an exploratory process and you will also need to\nallow room for flexibility. You should expect your program to change and grow\nalong with your business and what you learn over time.\n\n### Measure, check and iterate\n\nWhile setting up a CX program, and throughout its duration, measurement is\ncritical. Early in your planning phase, define the metrics that indicate\nsuccess and that you\u2019ll continually measure and track.\n\n**CSat**  and [NPS](/net-promoter-score) are likely candidates for many\nbusinesses, along with [CES](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-\nmanagement/customer/customer-effort-score/) (Customer Effort Score). You may\nalso want to pull in quantitative measures linked to CX, such as waiting times\non phone and chat channels, customer review scores, and website loading\nspeeds.  \n  \nEven more important than defining your metrics is being able to monitor them\non a continual basis. While it\u2019s true that using multiple metrics will help\nyou get a clearer and more multifaceted picture of how you\u2019re doing, make sure\nyour analytical capacity and your collection capacity are in line with one\nanother. Collecting data is only valuable if you\u2019re able to turn it into\nimprovements and predictions.\n\n### Software that supports your goals\n\nIn order to be useful, cost-effective and scalable, a CX program typically\nrelies on software to store data, route information to the right people and\nanalyze results. Here\u2019s what to look for in CX management software.\n\n#### Accessible everywhere\n\nCloud-based is becoming the gold standard in enterprise software, and with\ngood reason. A cloud-based platform means projects are easy to scale up to\nlarge numbers of users, and that they can access data and analyses on a range\nof devices according to need.\n\n#### User-friendly\n\nBecause CX is a cross-departmental discipline, it\u2019s important that your\nsoftware is as accessible as possible. It should be able to provide on-demand\ndata and insights in a format that anyone can understand.\n\n#### Analytically powerful\n\nIdeally, CX software should be able to not only collect data and analyze it,\nbut use statistical tools to extrapolate and make predictions about the\ndrivers behind positive CX outcomes. It\u2019s a plus if your software can perform\nanalysis on natural language, such as the contents of online reviews and free-\ntext fields in surveys.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nCX touches almost every part of your business, so it\u2019s important to be able to\nconnect your CX software with the platforms you already use, such as CRM and\nHR systems, marketing software, social media analytics, SEO and marketing\ntools.\n\n## Building your dream team\n\nCX is a company wide mission, and your CX team is the beating heart of the\noperation. But how do you bring that team together? To decide who you should\nhire or nurture, you need to know what makes a great CX professional.  \n  \nGiven that CX is a relatively new concept, it\u2019s unsurprising that most CX\nprofessionals have arrived from careers in other areas. HR is a common\nbackground, as is customer service. CX leaders may also cross over from user\nexperience and service design, psychology, marketing or sales.  \n  \nWherever they come from, they\u2019re united by personal qualities like empathy and\nexcellent listening skills. They\u2019re likely to be articulate and persuasive,\ngood at forming professional relationships and making the case for change.  \n  \nAbove all, they are passionate about what they do. They see CX transformation\nas a mission, not just a role, and they\u2019re committed to making the customer\ncentral to everything a business does.\n\n### A long-term view\n\nAs you embark on a CX program, it\u2019s important to set realistic expectations\nabout the timeframe of your work. CX management should be viewed as a long-\nterm program which will deliver long-term results, and it\u2019s likely that these\nwill grow steadily over time rather than offering immediate ROI.\n\nThe time it takes to see results varies by industry. As[ Colin Shaw of Beyond\nPhilosophy notes](https://beyondphilosophy.com/when-will-i-see-results-my-\ncustomer-experience-program/), if your typical customer contact cycle happens\nacross months or years rather than weeks \u2013 (e.g. if you provide infrequent\nservices like optical prescriptions or car servicing) \u2013 it will take longer\nfor customers to encounter and react to the improvements you\u2019ve made.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that it will take time for your internal CX process to reach\nits full potential in terms of speed and efficiency. Changing minds,\nbehaviors, culture, and protocols is by nature a long-term process, and\nwithout the right tools and plans in place, it will inevitably take longer.\n\nIs it worth the effort? Absolutely. And businesses willing to make the\ninvestment now will find themselves benefiting in the future as great CX\nbecomes more essential and expected.\n\nHistorical data bears this out, too. Across a 10-year span, businesses who\nmaintained above-average customer satisfaction (using ACSI scores) [delivered\na 400% increase in shareholder returns](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/putting-customer-experience-at-the-\nheart-of-next-generation-operating-models#0). Those with below-average scores\nachieved little or no growth in their returns.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCustomer experience touches every part of a business, and it makes significant\ndemands for change and reevaluation within a company. But it offers enormous\npotential too.\n\nCX isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have or an ephemeral buzzword. It\u2019s nothing less than\na more evolved way of doing business, and in an increasingly connected world\nwhere customer expectations have never been higher, it may well be the\ndeciding factor between businesses that fall by the wayside and those that go\non to bigger and better things.\n\n**Make sure your customers have the best experience with your brand that they\npossibly can.

Functions\n\n[Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/analytics/) [Latest\nNews](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\n[December 1, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/12/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-analytics-automation-drives-\ngreater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/#comments)\n\n![People Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/HR-Analytics123-1024x582.png)\n\nOrganizations have widely adopted the innovations of analytics to streamline\ntheir business operations and improve processes. Intending to achieve the\nability of reduced costs, increase in profitability and risk-management\nimprovement, nearly 97 percent of organizations today have adopted analytics\nwithin their system.\n\nWith the omnipresence of analytics, everything is tracked, analyzed and\noptimized based on derived insights. Organizations are figuring out what is\nuseful for their businesses, which skill is more effective in the current\nmarketplace.\n\nA variety of departments have followed the footprints to drive business\nstrategies and better decision-making system. But amid this, HR lags behind in\nincorporating a more quantitative approach.\n\nHR is a discipline that conventionally works around empathy, not facts. Due to\nwhich natural biases can drive strategic decisions about the workforce.\nTherefore, to remove such loopholes in the HR system, it is extremely\nquintessential for organizations to guide a series of workforce-discussions\nand decisions based on data.\n\nAccording to a study, around 84 percent of HR professionals say people\nanalytics are important whereas only 22 percent have already adopted analytics\nfunction. Well, the disparity can be considered as people data is an extremely\nchallenging form of big data.\n\nFortunately, owing to the evolution of bots and intelligent automation, the\nlengthy and manual processes of HR are getting depleted. The automation in HR\nfunctions is also enabling it to enhance its impact through more data-driven\nstrategies.\n\n\n\n#### **The Usefulness of Intelligent Automation**\n\nFor the new future of work where a huge amount of data is generated every day,\nrobotics and intelligent automation have become the largest drivers for\nefficiency. Both technologies are displacing workers in certain types of\nroles. For example, Bots are excellent at high-volume, transactional, and\nrules-based work, therefore they can handle building data centers and models.\n\nThe latest introduction of people analytics solutions has turned analytics\ninto more democratized and universal. People no longer need to be an expert to\ntake advantage of such data. Intelligent automation parses through all the\npeople\u2019s data for HR teams and brings relevant insights to the table.\n\nAlso, there are now pre-built people analytics solutions that will help people\nfind the answers to critical business queries.\n\n\n\n#### **Bots for Escalating Insights**\n\nCurrently, **** business leaders are in habit of having their KPIs on a set of\ndashboards but soon robotics will comb through analytical platforms (like\nVisier) to identify upcoming problem areas and escalate them to leaders.\nNotably, a bot could flag someone in HR automatically when employee turnover\naccelerates in a particular department. As not all leaders are consistent\nanalyzers of people analytics, therefore bot can inform and alert them when\nit\u2019s necessary. This will subsequently help [HR\nleaders](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/10-innovative-hr-analytics-\nsolutions-providers-2019/) tackle potential problems before they increase.\n\n\n\n#### **Organizing HR Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics tools invest a lot of time in sorting and identifying which\nquery they should solve first. Here, the ability of bots to organize and\nprioritize queries can enhance the efficiency of the process.\n\n\n\n#### **Prospects of Automation in HR**\n\nAs robotics and intelligent automation are still evolving, they possess a huge\npotential to transform HR from being qualitative to focusing on factual, data-\ndriven and actionable insights.\n\nImplementing technologies that flags potential problems, helps HR deal with\nreal-time issues while empowering organizations to increase their business\nimpact. Shortly, employees will use solutions that blend data and robust\npredictive models to make better decisions.\n\nAs the conventional hiring tools are massively reduced, revamped workforce\ntools will balance the employee supply and demand cycle. This will radically\ntransform the people management and HR functions.\n\n[Human Resources](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/human-resources/)\n[People Analytics](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/people-analytics/)\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/&title=People\nAnalytics Automation Drives Greater Efficiency for HR Functions) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/people-\nanalytics-automation-drives-greater-efficiency-for-hr-\nfunctions/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/HR-Analytics123.png&description=People Analytics\nAutomation Drives Greater Efficiency for HR Functions)\n\n## Related Latest News Articles\n\nSimilar Posts From Latest News Category\n\n[ ![Google Cloud Next 2018 Promises to Take AI and Machine Learning to New\nHeights](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Google-\nCloud-Next-2018-173x130_c.jpg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/google-\ncloud-next-2018-promises-to-take-ai-and-machine-learning-to-new-heights/)\n\n#### [Google Cloud Next 2018 Promises to Take AI and Machine Learning to New\nHeights](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/google-cloud-next-2018-promises-to-\ntake-ai-and-machine-learning-to-new-heights/)\n\n[August 8, 2018](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2018/08/)\n\n[ ![Top 5 Foundation Principles of AI](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/AI-Foundation-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-5-foundation-principles-of-ai/)\n\n#### [Top 5 Foundation Principles of\nAI](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-5-foundation-principles-of-ai/)\n\n[October 21, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/10/)\n\n[ ![When and How Did the Media and Entertainment Industry Become so Analytics\nIntensive?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-\nand-Entertainment-173x130_c.jpg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/when-and-\nhow-did-the-media-and-entertainment-industry-become-so-analytics-intensive/)\n\n#### [When and How Did the Media and Entertainment Industry Become so\nAnalytics Intensive?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/when-and-how-did-the-\nmedia-and-entertainment-industry-become-so-analytics-intensive/)\n\n[February 6, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/02/)\n\n## No Comments so far\n\nJump into a conversation\n\n### No Comments Yet!\n\nYou can be the one to start a conversation.\n\n###  [Click here to cancel reply.](/people-analytics-automation-drives-\ngreater-efficiency-for-hr-functions/#respond)\n\n__**Your data will be safe!** Your e-mail address will not be published.
