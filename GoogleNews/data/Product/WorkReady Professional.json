team is dedicated to finding and telling you more about the products and\ndeals we love. If you love them too and decide to purchase through the links\nbelow, we may receive a commission. Pricing and availability are subject to\nchange.  _\n\nObviously, working from home isn\u2019t the most inspiring situation for you to get\ndressed up and look stylish for a day of work. When you can finally get out of\nbed and wear your pajamas at your desk, why change it?\n\nBut if you do have a job that requires you to dress up or lately you\u2019ve been\nfinding yourself on multiple video calls a day, you can still look presentable\nwithout having to fully suit up thanks to a few key pieces. Top a casual tee\nwith a more tailored blazer or throw a blouse on over cozy leggings to look\nwork-ready while on camera.\n\nHowever, if figuring out this new work-from-home wardrobe isn\u2019t your forte,\ncompanies like [Stitch Fix](https://fave.co/2raISz1), [Rent The\nRunway](https://fave.co/2raISz1) and [Nuuly](https://fave.co/2Jt9CAC) can help\nrefresh your clothes from afar. Rent and return clothes from your favorite\ndesigners or have a stylist take the lead and send you options based on your\npersonal style.\n\n **Keep reading to get all of[Stitch Fix](https://fave.co/2raISz1) stylist\nLayne Cross\u2019 tips for looking your best remotely!**\n\n> [ View this post on\n> Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hNK14B2uV/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n> [\ud83d\udcbc Workweek prep: what would you\n> add?](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hNK14B2uV/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n> A post shared by [ Stitch\n> Fix](https://www.instagram.com/stitchfix/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n> (@stitchfix) on Mar 9, 2020 at 9:01am PDT\n\n **Look and feel confident** : \u201cEnsure you feel professional when dialing-in\nfor video calls, slip on your favorite business casual top and pair with loose\nbottoms for comfort. This will give you confidence as you navigate this new\nplatform.\u201d\n\n **Remain consistent:** \u201cYou want to be perceived just as you would in the\noffice. You don\u2019t need to don your best fitting pencil skirt and favorite\nblazer while WFH, but being polished-yet-approachable is more important than\never.\u201d\n\n **Weekend-wear makes great WFH attire** : \u201cWomen can look to brands like LNA,\nScotch & Soda, and La Ligne for relaxed officewear styles. Similarly, menswear\nlabels like Faherty, Todd Snyder, and Alternative Apparel offer woven knits\nand polos that pair well with sweatpants for a look that combines work on top\nwith comfort on the bottom.\u201d\n\n###  **[Get started with Stitch Fix here.](https://fave.co/2raISz1)**\n\n _If you liked this story, you might like to shop these[beauty

via their virtual learning environment, enabling those\nrecently furloughed to reskill and join the digital workforce.\n\nBusiness owners who wish to upskill their team, or who are facing the tough\ndecision on whether to furlough staff, can now take some comfort in the\nopportunity that allows any furloughed member of staff to be retrained during\nthe furloughed period - helping both the team member to access future career\nopportunities and the business to digitally transform their workforce.\n\nFor individuals wishing to upskill or retrain as a Software Developer, Code\nNation's courses are now being taught remotely in their virtual learning\nenvironment by full-time instructors, utilising the latest technology and\ntools available in remote and virtual learning.\n\nCode Nation's 3 week 'Develop: Coding' course immerses students in the\nfundamentals of front-end and mobile app development and gives them a platform\nto build their careers in the digital sector, while their flagship 12 week\n'Master: Coding' bootcamp prepares students for careers as professional\ndevelopers with a full-stack curriculum shaped by the demands of technical\nemployers.\n\n**Code Nation 's CEO, Andy Lord said:**\n\n\"Given the unprecedented situation regarding COVID-19, we want to help more\npeople improve their technical knowledge and gain skills that will make them\nemployable in the modern workforce. Our virtual classroom provides students\nwith the ability to learn and engage with us no matter where they are\".\n\nStudents joining the courses will be trained in the latest web technologies\nand agile methodologies to enable them to upskill within their current\nbusiness or apply for new roles. Graduates are prepared to join a sector that\nis seeing a further increase in the demand for talent following the emergence\nof new virtual solutions driven by the current government lockdown measures.\n\nCode Nation's training courses have traditionally been available in their UK-\nbased campuses to deliver 'work ready' courses for anyone wishing to move into\nthe digital sector. However, their employment-focussed training is now being\ndelivered virtually in order to maintain their efforts in solving the digital\nskills gap whilst giving those who have been furloughed access to career-\ntransforming training.\n\n**Andy continues,** \"The current lockdown has changed the way we go about our\nlives.

If they've unfortunately had to\nfurlough staff that can't work given the current climate - we can turn them\ninto tech superstars by the time 'business as usual' comes around, or if\nthey've been inspired by working virtually to change the way they operate - we\ncan help them level up their development teams and create tech talent for them\nfor free\".\n\nBusinesses in need of technical talent at this time can train their staff for\nfree using Code Nation's apprenticeship programme. Apprentices start their\nprogramme with the 'Master: Coding' bootcamp for 12 weeks to complete all of\nthe required off-the-job training and develop the technical skills and\ncommercial awareness that their employer requires. All of this is done at no\ncost to the business thanks to the Apprenticeship Levy.\n\nIndividuals who are looking for a career change or an opportunity to learn the\nskills required to enter the digital industries can also take advantage of\nthis opportunity, learning to code from the comfort of their own home during\nthe current lockdown period.\n\nFor more information about Code Nation,

But with more and more people staying at home\nthese days, sweating has become a popular option as the rules for \"work-ready\"\noutfits start to fade. But even if you work from home - and only take video\ncalls of the size - you will still want to watch together, if not for your own\nupkeep and your sanity, then for those who have to share a space ( restricted)\naround you.\n\n### **What you need to know before buying sweatpants**\n\n**In shape** : The right pair of sweatpants can actually be part of an\nelegant, polished look, as long as they fit well. Look for sweatpants with a\nmore fitted cut; you don't want them to cling to you like tights or workout\nleggings, but you shouldn't swim in them either. It's best to leave baggy\nsweats in bed.\n\n**Materials** : Most of the sweatpants are made from cotton fleece material,\nwhich is super soft and comfortable. But cheap cotton often leads to pilling,\nand some sweatpants lose shape and elasticity the more they are washed. It's\nnice to have that old pair of sweatpants in which you like to relax, but wear\na new pair the next time you go shopping or take video calls. Look for soft,\nbreathable materials that repel rather than absorb perspiration. Also consider\ncotton blended materials, which can add structure and form. Most of the\noptions on our list included a touch of spandex, for a stretchy, comfortable\nfit that works just as well for yoga or work.\n\n**Style** : Today, brands make sweatpants of all shapes and styles. We've\nlisted classic sweatpants, as well as jogger-style sweatshirts that are cut\nand handcuffed to the ankles. We also found sweatpants for women with a\nflattering flared style, as well as streetwear-inspired looks. And, because\nyou can't just relax in pants all the time, we found a comfortable T-shirt\ndress that promises the same ease and comfort as sweatshirts, in a slightly\nmore sophisticated finish.\n\n### **1\\. Champion Graphic Powerblend Fleece Jogger**\n\nMade from a blend of cotton and polyester 50/50, these fleece sweatpants have\nribbed cuffs for a more fitted fit, as well as two side pockets for storing\nsnacks, headphones and other essentials for work home. We love the old-\nfashioned Champion logo, although Amazon offers more than 20 different colors\nand styles.\n\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\n#### Champion Powerblend Fleece Jogger, $ 15.99 +, available on Amazon\n\n### **2\\. Todd Snyder x Champion light jogging pants**\n\nIf you want a more premium pair of Champion sweatpants, get these joggers,\nwhich are part of Champion's long-standing collaboration with New York men's\nclothing designer Todd Snyder.\n\nThe jogging pants have a thinner cut than your basic sweatpants and are made\nin Canada from a very soft French terry cloth. The material is more resistant\nto repeated washing and will not pile up and lose its shape. The sweatshirts\nare dyed for a comfortable and lively texture, and finished with elastic\ncuffs, two cut pockets and a practical drawstring closure. More than 12 colors\navailable, in sizes XS to XXL.\n\nCourtesy of Todd Snyder\n\n#### Todd Snyder x Champion Slim Jogger, $ 118, available at Todd Snyder\n\n### **3\\. Athleta Sutton Jogger**\n\nMade from recycled polyester material from plastic bottles, the Athleta\n\"Sutton\" jogger is ideal for lounging, but sufficiently assembled to be used\nfor shopping or brunch. The silky material is light and soft against the skin,\nwith a touch of elastane for more comfort. Two front pockets, two cargo\npockets and two rear pockets provide space for your phone, wallet and\naccessories.\n\nWhat we like: the \u201cRecycled Featherweight Stretch\u201d fabric is super breathable\nand dries easily, which makes it ideal for light jogging or training too.\n\nCourtesy Athleta\n\n#### Athleta Sutton jogging pants, $ 89.99, available at Athleta\n\n### **4\\. Sweaty Betty Explorer Sweatpants**\n\nIf you want the feel of yoga sweatpants without the need for leggings, get a\npair of these \"Explorer\" sweatpants from athletic brand Sweaty Betty. The\nthick, comfortable material keeps you nice and comfortable, and isn't as\n\"revealing\" as the cheaper sweatpants made from thin-lined fabrics.\n\nThe pants have a more relaxed fit, with a taller waist and a drawstring to\nkeep everything inside. The material also contains 18% elastane, making it a\ngreat option to wear from your morning stretch to your afternoon Skype.\n\nCourtesy of Nordstrom\n\n#### Sweaty Betty Explorer track pants, $ 180, available at Nordstrom\n\nLooking for a more affordable option? Nordstrom currently offers Sweaty Betty\npants at 40% off. See the full selection here.\n\n### **5\\. Mack Weldon Ace Track Pants**\n\nWe've already written about our love for Mack Weldon, and the online\nretailer's best-selling pants are the Ace pants, a more adult version of your\nclassic track pants. Unlike the baggy sweatshirts (and flasks) in which you\nbask, these have a more fitted cut, with ribbed cuffs at the ankles and a\ndrawstring at the waist. They are also very comfortable, sanded for a softer\nand softer finish (read: no annoying pilling or loose threads here). Several\ncolors are available online.\n\nCourtesy of Mack Weldon\n\n#### Mack Weldon Ace track pants, $ 78, available at Mack Weldon\n\n### **6\\. Zella Getaway Flowy Crop Wide Track Pants**\n\nThese wide pants are an easy and versatile step compared to basic sweatshirts.\nThey have a comfortable elastic waistband and a flattering shape. Put on a\nsweatshirt or cardigan at the top and you get an instant outfit ready for\nzoom. Pair it with comfortable slippers while you're at home and a pair of\nsneakers the next time you go out for a simple transitional look.\n\nCourtesy of Nordstrom\n\n#### Zella Getaway Wide Leg Pants, $ 59, available at Nordstrom\n\n### **7\\. Rhone Guru Pants**\n\nOne of the most popular leisure pants for men right now is these Rh\u00f4ne \"Guru\"\npants. They feel like gym shorts or yoga pants, but are constructed with a\nlittle more structure, so you can wear them also after the sweat session. The\ncut is adjusted, but will not be as tight as some of the other pants on our\nlist. The four-way stretch material gives you plenty of room to move.\n\nCourtesy Rhone\n\n#### Rhone Guru pants, $ 98, available at Rhone\n\n### **8\\. Nike Sportswear woven swoosh pants**\n\nIt's a great time to trade your regular yarns for something different, and we\nlove the bold, streetwear-inspired look of these unisex pants from Nike. The\n\"Swoosh\" pants have a looser cut with a shortened ankle, a buckle style belt\nand a ripstop nylon material. Just because you're stuck at home doesn't mean\nyou can't show a little dress flair.\n\nCourtesy Nike\n\n#### Nike Sportswear Woven Swoosh pants, $ 70, available at Nike\n\n### **9\\. Goodthreads slim fit jogging pants**\n\nIf you want something a little more presentable than sweatpants, consider\nbuying a pair of joggers, like this pair of cotton blends from Amazon's house\nbrand, Goodthreads. Like a crossover between a pair of sweatpants and classic\nchinos, these jogging pants are slim cut, with tapered and elastic cuffs at\nthe ankle and a drawstring at the waist. There is no sacrificing comfort for\nstyle here: a touch of elasticity allows you to easily move around in the\npants while looking like you were screwed up when you woke up for work this\nmorning.\n\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\n#### Goodthreads slim fit joggers, $ 9.54 +, available on Amazon\n\n### **10\\.

If you have a teleconference or an\nimportant interview, the dress adds instant polish for a more sophisticated\nprofessional look.\n\nThe 100% cotton dress has a relaxed fit and flattering short sleeves for all\nbody types and perfectly embodies the Everlane philosophy of clean, minimalist\nbasics. As the brand says, \"this stylish staple can easily take you to\nmargarita meetings.\"\n\nCourtesy of Everlane\n\n#### Everlane Cotton Tee Dress, $ 50, available at Everlane\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [home](https://mashviral.com/tag/home/)\n  * [Ideas](https://mashviral.com/tag/ideas/)\n  * [men](https://mashviral.com/tag/men/)\n  * [Outfit](https://mashviral.com/tag/outfit/)\n  * [sweatpants](https://mashviral.com/tag/sweatpants/)\n  * [women](https://mashviral.com/tag/women/)\n  * [work](https://mashviral.com/tag/work/)\n\n[ __ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashviral.com%2Fbest-\nsweatpants-for-men-and-women-2020-home-work-outfit-ideas%2F)[ __ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Best+sweatpants+for+men+and+women+2020%3A+home+work+outfit+ideas&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashviral.com%2Fbest-\nsweatpants-for-men-and-women-2020-home-work-outfit-\nideas%2F&via=Mashviral+News)[ __ Pinterest\n](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://mashviral.com/best-\nsweatpants-for-men-and-women-2020-home-work-outfit-\nideas/&media=https://mashviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-sweatpants-\nfor-men-and-women-2020-home-work-outfit-\nscaled.jpg&description=Best+sweatpants+for+men+and+women+2020%3A+home+work+outfit+ideas)[\n__ WhatsApp\n](whatsapp://send?text=Best+sweatpants+for+men+and+women+2020%3A+home+work+outfit+ideas\n%0A%0A https://mashviral.com/best-sweatpants-for-men-and-women-2020-home-work-\noutfit-ideas/)\n\n__\n\nPrevious article['Cuomo Crush' and 'Fauci Fever' - The sexuality of these men\nis a real thing on the Internet](https://mashviral.com/cuomo-crush-and-fauci-\nfever-the-sexuality-of-these-men-is-a-real-thing-on-the-internet/)\n\nNext article[Save on toys, food, and more](https://mashviral.com/save-on-toys-\nfood-and-more/)\n\n[![Sara McClain](https://mashviral.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Sara-150x150.jpg)](https://mashviral.com/author/saramcclain/)\n\n[Sara McClain](https://mashviral.com/author/saramcclain/)\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * [States race to battle almost 400,000 cases with extensive-awaited medical shipments](https://mashviral.com/states-race-to-battle-almost-400000-cases-with-extensive-awaited-medical-shipments/)\n  * [Worry about stress as students prepare for modified pre-placement exams during school closure](https://mashviral.com/worry-about-stress-as-students-prepare-for-modified-pre-placement-exams-during-school-closure/)\n  * [Facebook launches a messenger for couples to help them cope with social distance](https://mashviral.com/facebook-launches-a-messenger-for-couples-to-help-them-cope-with-social-distance/)\n  * [When are the London gangs on Sky Atlantic and NOW on TV?

More \u2014 as many as we can find\nand fast,\u201d Dr Hazledine said.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely challenging time for our frontline staff. Normal winter\nillnesses and its flow-on demand will start soon, and this will place\nadditional pressure on an already pressured health system.\u201d\n\nBoth recruitment agencies will guide medical professionals through the normal\nregistration processes for locum work and match the availability and skills of\neach professional to roles needing to be filled. Dr Hazledine said although\nthe process will be fast and efficient, due care will still be taken to ensure\nall qualifications, CVs and references are appropriately checked and that all\nthose recruited are fit for purpose and work ready.\n\nDr Hazledine stressed that the roles are paid and do not have to be full-time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking doctors and nurses to contribute what they can \u2014 if we know what\nskills and time they are able to offer, Medworld, MedRecruit and our partners\ncan provide an organised approach to matching gaps in hospital and clinic\nrosters with skilled medical professionals. Together, we can fight this thing.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for entrepreneurial companies such as ours to step up in a\npublic service sense to provide any assistance we can \u2014 we have the\ninfrastructure and experience to make a difference and we\u2019re determined to do\nthat,\u201d he said.\n\nQualified doctors and nurses interested in answering the recruitment call are\nencouraged to go to the Medworld website \u2014\n[www.medworld.com](https://unite.medworld.com/bettertogether/) \u2014 to register.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest challenge our generation has been handed,\u201d Dr Hazledine\nsaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to rise to that challenge in these unprecedented times for\nmedicine. We need to rally, act and be better together.\u201d\n\n######### _Image caption: MedWorld Founder and Managing Director Dr Sam\nHazledine.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nChirag Shah\n\nSVP of growth markets at [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/),\nhelping organizations of all sizes recruit, train and manage their people.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nThe world of work is under pressure. Every industry is digitizing products and\nservices and creating worldwide demand for [new types of\nskills](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-25-most-in-demand-job-skills-right-\nnow-according-to-linkedin.html). These issues are having a significant impact\non businesses of all sizes and can be especially challenging for small and\nmedium-sized companies that don\u2019t have access to the same resources as large\nenterprises.\n\nAs this shift continues, I expect that many workers will put in more hours on\nthe job, take more work home, spend more time in their cars, and generally\nfeel more stress. So it\u2019s no surprise to hear some employees are unengaged\n(13% are actively disengaged and 53% are not engaged, according to 2018 Gallup\n[research](https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-engagement-rise.aspx))\nand burnt out. A 2018 Gallup\n[report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/237059/employee-burnout-part-main-\ncauses.aspx) noted that 23% of full-time employees surveyed said they felt\nburned out at work very often or always, and 44% said they were sometimes\nburned out. In an economy where [some say](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-\nfront/2019/09/10/are-wages-rising-falling-or-stagnating/) wages have been\nlargely stagnant while demands and uncertainty continue, it\u2019s increasingly\ncommon for workers to struggle to understand their place \u2014 or visualize their\nfuture.\n\nOlder workers are expected to make up a greater share of [labor force\nparticipation](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/older-\nworkers.htm) over time, but they may feel unsure how long their skills will be\nrelevant in this ever-changing marketplace. Many workers are participating in\nthe gig economy, whether by choice or necessity. According to 2018 Gallup\n[research](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/240929/workplace-leaders-learn-\nreal-gig-economy.aspx), \"36% of U.S. workers participate in the gig economy\nthrough either their primary or secondary jobs.\" But acquiring more 1099s can\nmean they have less time to focus on their own personal and professional\ndevelopment or on building the foundation for a rewarding long-term career.\n\nAmid all of this uncertainty, companies are locked in a [war for\ntalent](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/260564/heard-quit-rate-win-war-\ntalent.aspx). As the SVP of growth markets at a talent management system and\nsoftware company, I've heard that finding the right people has become much\nmore challenging, a problem that's compounded by [low unemployment\nrates](https://data.oecd.org/unemp/unemployment-rate.htm) in some parts of the\nworld and a [declining number of\nworkers](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-\ndata/publications/economic-insights/2017/q4/eiq4_where-is-everybody.pdf?la=en)\nin others. In my work with companies in Singapore, Japan and elsewhere, I\u2019ve\nseen how changing demographics, regulations and other factors are forcing\ncompanies to get creative with how they manage their people.\n\nEmployees and their employers alike are caught among these forces. Companies\ncan\u2019t just throw people at problems anymore or expect workers to put in longer\nhours. They should find a way to engage employees and help them become more\nproductive in a healthy way.\n\nSmall and medium-sized companies competing for the same recruits may face an\neven steeper incline, since they must find a way to match the value\nproposition of large companies without the large-company budget.\n\n**The Importance Of Well-Being Programs**\n\nMany companies are realizing that the solution across all these factors is to\nfocus on their overall employee experience and to promote programs that\nprovide for employees\u2019 physical and mental health, financial stability, and\ncareer growth.\n\nThese kinds of employee well-being programs aren\u2019t just good for workers \u2014\nthey are becoming the new frontier for building value as an organization. As\n[Deloitte pointed out\nrecently](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2019/workforce-engagement-employee-experience.html#endnote-2), the\nfindings from 2017 MIT\n[research](https://www.avanade.com/~/media/asset/thinking/mit-research.pdf)\nshow \"that enterprises with a top-quartile employee experience achieve twice\nthe innovation, double the customer satisfaction, and 25 percent higher\nprofits than organizations with a bottom-quartile employee experience. Yet as\nimportant as it is, only 9 percent of our respondents believed they were very\nready to address this issue, making it a massive priority for organizations\naround the world.\u201d\n\nIn other words, employee well-being can provide real benefits to the overall\neffectiveness of a business, its ability to get the most out of its people\nand, ultimately, its financial results.\n\n**Building From The Bottom Up**\n\nSo what do those types of programs look like, and what makes them effective?\nIn designing the right mix of programs and perks, I'd say the best approach is\nto treat your employees as you would your customers. Employees will have\ndifferent needs, just like customers do, so it\u2019s important for employers to\nunderstand those needs and develop well-being programs and employee perks at a\nlocal, personal level.\n\nThis includes the basics, such as offering flexible schedules or work-from-\nhome opportunities, providing a healthy office environment, and extending\ncompetitive benefits packages. It also includes specifics, such as supporting\nvolunteer activities, diversity affinity groups, employee assistance programs,\nand off-work activities such as hiking or skiing clubs.\n\nBut at my company, I've seen that the No. 1 factor that makes people feel\nmotivated and engaged in their jobs is the ability to grow and expand their\nskills and to gain new opportunities to advance their careers. One of the most\nimportant well-being opportunities companies have is to offer career\ndevelopment for their people. HR should become, at least in part, an internal\ntalent mobility department to facilitate employee development. At the end of\nthe day, we're all human and constantly growing. Employers can offer\ndevelopment opportunities like attending an industry event or do something as\nsimple as spending more time together as a team. Encouraging employees to take\nan hour away from their desks and grab lunch is a cost-effective way to\npromote morale. Connecting with others and learning about co-workers' roles in\na more relaxed setting can promote a culture that values well-being.\n\nWhatever mix a company chooses, it\u2019s important to remember that this is a\njourney and that finding the right employee well-being benefits is an ongoing\neffort that will evolve and change over time.\n\nRegardless of a company\u2019s size, to compete in the modern environment, it\nshould elevate well-being programs as a core function for HR and people\nservices. All companies should be asking themselves: How can we create an\nenvironment where people show up for work ready to thrive? How can we create\nthe best possible experience for the employees we have and enable them to do\ntheir best work?\n\n[Forbes Business Development\nCouncil](http://www.forbesbizdevcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbesbizdevcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Chirag Shah](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/files/2019/12/chiragshah1_avatar_1577397466.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/people/chiragshah1/\n\"Photo of Chirag Shah\")\n\n[Chirag\nShah](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/people/chiragshah1/)\n\nSVP of growth markets at [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/),\nhelping organizations of all sizes recruit, train and manage their people.\n[Read Chirag Shah's full executive profile\nhere](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/bizdev/profile/Chirag-Shah-SVP-\nGeneral-Manager-Growth-Markets-\nCornerstone/986f7134-48a5-4c6c-b232-fb84f9f45d1b).\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nSVP of growth markets at [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/),\nhelping organizations of all sizes recruit, train and manage their people.\n[Read Chirag Shah's full executive profile\nhere](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/bizdev/profile/Chirag-Shah-SVP-\nGeneral-Manager-Growth-Markets-\nCornerstone/986f7134-48a5-4c6c-b232-fb84f9f45d1b).\n\n Read Less\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Chirag Shah&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Why The Future Of Productivity Is At The Intersection Of Well-Being And Performance %0A Author: Chirag Shah %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2020/03/13/why-the-future-of-productivity-is-at-the-intersection-of-well-being-and-performance/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

size\n\n **Berlin:** Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has hashed out strategies\nwith German business and union officials on attracting skilled workers from\noutside the European Union as the country tries to tackle a shortfall of\nqualified professionals.\n\nMerkel said the first two pillars of her government's approach to the problem\nwould be providing more training for Germans and working to attract\nprofessionals from other EU countries.\n\n![There's a shortage of nurses and other skilled workers in Germany and the\ncountry is now looking beyond the EU for\ntalent.](https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.19%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e0457808e28a0d5992c6af67c6a7a938bc3542e1)\n\nThere's a shortage of nurses and other skilled workers in Germany and the\ncountry is now looking beyond the EU for talent.Credit:E+\n\nBut recognising those steps will not be sufficient; Germany needs to recruit\nworkers from outside the trade bloc, she said. To do that, it needs to make it\neasier for skilled workers to get visas to quickly start new jobs, and ensure\nthe country is seen as an attractive place to resettle.\n\n\"It's not only us who are looking at the world's professionals,\" she said.\n\"There is great competition in this area.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegislation due to take effect on March 1 will make it easier for non-EU\nnationals to obtain visas to work and seek jobs in Germany. Arrangements\ncurrently applied to university graduates are being expanded to immigrants\nwith professional qualifications and German language knowledge.\n\nSectors such as information technology and nursing have complained of labour\nshortages.\n\nLoading\n\n\"Many companies in Germany are urgently seeking skilled workers, even in times\nof a weaker economy,\" Eric Schweitzer, president of the Association of German\nChambers of Commerce and Industry, told the _Funke_ newspaper group ahead of\nthe meetings. \"For more than half of companies, the shortage of skilled\nworkers is currently the biggest risk to business.\"\n\nIngo Kramer, the head of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations,\nnoted that some 430,000 migrants who came as asylum seekers since 2015 are now\nin jobs, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect at least 100,000 positions\na year could be filled by actively seeking educated professionals from\noutside.\n\n\"The process has to go quickly, so that it is not long and bureaucratic,\" he\nsaid.\n\n[Loading](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[\n\n###\n\n](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\n[Replay\n\n###\n\nReplay video](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[Play video\n\n###\n\n](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[Play video\n\n###\n\n](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\nHe added that it was also clear that if Germany wanted those workers to\nremain, \"it is important that they feel at home here\".\n\nThe government hopes to increase use of its \"Make it in Germany\" information\nportal, for skilled workers, which includes a hotline and jobs board. The plan\nalso calls for companies offering more jobs targeted at foreign workers.\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier said the government and business groups had\nalso agreed to set up pilot projects with some countries, like India, Brazil\nand Vietnam, to hone the new approach.\n\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas promised to increase his office's capacity to\nprocess visas and to digitise the process.\n\n\"The German government is showing today that it is serious about eliminating\nthe shortage of skilled workers,\" Maas said in a statement.\n\nLike many other European countries, Germany is trying to strike a balance\nbetween the needs of its labour market, an ageing native population and\nconcern about immigration.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany party has made gains in recent years\nwith an anti-immigrant platform. The party's co-parliamentary leader, Alice\nWeidel, spoke against the new labour policies, saying the focus should instead\nbe on preventing qualified professionals from leaving Germany.\n\n\"The planned recruitment of skilled workers from abroad will further\nexacerbate the problem of immigration and the social systems,\" Weidel said.\n\"In the end, it will turn out that when we call for specialists, we get\nwelfare recipients.\"\n\n **AP**\n\n  * [Jobs](/topic/jobs-5yw)\n  * [Germany](/topic/germany-9zg)\n  * [Angela Merkel](/topic/angela-merkel-21r)\n\n## Most Viewed in

You worry about the\nhealth of your business or organization, your employees or fellow employees,\nand you worry about those you have served faithfully for many years: Those you\nclean for, those you provide services for, those who you call your clients or\ncustomers.\n\nIn this time of crisis, you realize they aren\u2019t just _clients_ or _customers_.\nThey are also friends, and like you, facing many dilemmas and predicaments\nabout what to do.\n\nOne thing is sure: In the past few weeks, as this situation has continued to\ndevelop, our industry is coming together. It is uniting. And preparing to deal\nwith the issues we all face and come out of this stronger and better than\never.\n\nRead on to learn how two leaders in the contract cleaning segment of our\nindustry are dealing with the crisis in the first part of a five-part series\nwritten by ISSA Media Editorial Director Jeff Cross on how the cleaning\nindustry is responding to the pandemic.

and Frito-Lay representatives talk with SOC students about\npossible future opportunities at the school\u2019s career day.  \nPhoto courtesy: Dallas ISD\n\nAs an industry partner with the South Oak Cliff High School P-TECH, PepsiCo\nand Frito-Lay are showing students great potential opportunities available to\nthem after high school.PepsiCo and Frito-Lay have developed and implemented\nprogramming with the SOC P-TECH that covers careers, college, communication,\nleadership, collaboration, time management, public speaking, resumes and\ninterviewing. PepsiCo and Frito-Lay have hosted college and career fairs where\nmore than 150 associates mentored 300 students by sharing their college\nexperiences.\n\nAlso, PepsiCo and Frito-Lay launched a mentorship program that has 20\nmentors/mentees and hosted three summer interns as part of the Dallas Mayor\u2019s\nIntern Fellows Program. PepsiCo and Frito-Lay provide SOC with a Food for Good\nmonthly donation of nutritional food and snacks for the 60 known homeless\nstudents who attend the school.\n\n\u201cAt our Frito-Lay, Gatorade and Pepsi businesses, we have 1,500 full-time\npositions within a 20-mile drive of South Oak Cliff High School,\u201d said Kathy\nAlfano, a senior director of economic development at PepsiCo. \u201cOur goal is to\nbuild opportunities through our work in Southern Dallas and P-TECH that will\ncreate ongoing future growth for our city \u2013 including the potential for these\nstudents to pursue jobs at PepsiCo.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, SOC Assistant Principal Victoria Davis said PepsiCo and Frito-Lay\nare having a tremendous positive impact on the students.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with PepsiCo and Frito-Lay have helped create a climate of\ncareer readiness that prepares the students for their future,\u201d Davis said.\n\u201cTheir constant presence at SOC P-TECH enables the students to build a solid\nfoundation of preparedness for the professional world, which brings timeless\nexperiences such as mentorships, career/college fairs, site visits, and\ninternships.\u201d\n\nP-TECH, which stands for Pathways in Technology Early College High School, is\na global education model consisting of a partnership between a school, higher-\neducation institution, and industry partner. High school students enrolled in\na P-TECH can earn an associate degree or up to 60 hours of tuition-free\ncollege credit. Dallas ISD is home to 18 P-TECHs.\n\nIn addition, students enrolled in a P-TECH develop skills in a specific\nacademic pathway through mentorships and internships with industry partners.\nThis enables students to enter the job market with work-ready skills.\n\n\u201cDallas ISD has put together a transformative educational program for high\nschool students with the P-TECH program, as it encourages students to pursue\nassociate degrees while completing high school and obtain mentoring and job\nexperiences directly from corporate partners like PepsiCo and Frito-Lay,\u201d\nAlfano said.\n\n[![](//assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png)](//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/2020/03/10/pepsico-and-frito-lay-\npartnership-with-dallas-isd-p-tech-valued/#respond)\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\n\nPlease enter your email address here\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n__\n\nShare\n\n[ __ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthdallasgazette.com%2F2020%2F03%2F10%2Fpepsico-\nand-frito-lay-partnership-with-dallas-isd-p-tech-valued%2F)[ __ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=PepsiCo+and+Frito-\nLay+partnership+with+Dallas+ISD+P-Tech+valued&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthdallasgazette.com%2F2020%2F03%2F10%2Fpepsico-\nand-frito-lay-partnership-with-dallas-isd-p-tech-\nvalued%2F&via=North+Dallas+Gazette)[ __ Pinterest\n](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://northdallasgazette.com/2020/03/10/pepsico-\nand-frito-lay-partnership-with-dallas-isd-p-tech-\nvalued/&media=https://northdallasgazette.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/dallas-isd-ptech.jpg&description=As an industry\npartner with the South Oak Cliff High School P-TECH, PepsiCo and Frito-Lay are\nshowing students great potential opportunities available to them after high\nschool.)[ __ WhatsApp ](whatsapp://send?text=PepsiCo+and+Frito-\nLay+partnership+with+Dallas+ISD+P-Tech+valued %0A%0A\nhttps://northdallasgazette.com/2020/03/10/pepsico-and-frito-lay-partnership-\nwith-dallas-isd-p-tech-valued/)\n\n__\n\n#### Related Articles\n\n[Latest News](https://northdallasgazette.com/category/front-page/latest-news/)\n\n[](https://northdallasgazette.com/2020/04/07/in-memoriam-earl-graves-sr-black-\nenterprise-founder-dies/ \"IN MEMORIAM: Earl Graves Sr., Black Enterprise\nFounder Dies\")\n\n### [IN MEMORIAM: Earl Graves Sr., Black Enterprise Founder\nDies](https://northdallasgazette.com/2020/04/07/in-memoriam-earl-graves-sr-\nblack-enterprise-founder-dies/ \"IN MEMORIAM: Earl Graves Sr., Black Enterprise\nFounder Dies\")\n\n[NDG Staff](https://northdallasgazette.com/author/ndg-staff/) - April 7, 2020\n[0](https://northdallasgazette.com/2020/04/07/in-memoriam-earl-graves-sr-\nblack-enterprise-founder-dies/#respond)\n\nBy Stacy M.

\"New jewellery qualification aims to make\nsure students are \u201cwork ready\u201d\")\n\n**The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and the British Academy of\nJewellery (BAJ) have developed new training courses, which aim to give\nstudents the skills they need to thrive in this competitive industry.**\n\nThe partnership, which combines BAJ\u2019s knowledge of the sector with SQA\u2019s\nrobust quality assurance processes, has resulted in a four year Jewellery\nManufacturing and Design Diploma Programme.\n\nThe Diploma begins at Level 3 on the Qualifications and Credit Framework\n(QCF), providing students with a solid foundation in the technical and\ncreative skills required to become a jeweller.\n\nStory continues below\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents then have the opportunity, over the course of three years, to work\ntowards Levels 4, 5 and 6.\n\nThis sees students gain advanced jewellery manufacturing skills, as well as\nexpertise in Computer Aided Design (CAD), which harnesses the latest\ntechnology.\n\nA key requirement when developing the Diploma was that students should not\nonly gain these technical skills, but they should also be equipped with\nbroader skills to help them achieve their future goals.\n\nKate Rieppel, Head of Programmes at the British Academy of Jewellery,\nexplains: \u201cWe found that with SQA we had the freedom to put our own input into\nthe programmes. The idea behind the Diploma structure is that we have the\nflexibility to combine aspects of the jewellery industry within each course.\"\n\nThroughout the Diploma, students are encouraged to embrace their creativity\nand to develop their own unique style.\n\nRieppel adds: \u201cPart of the programme we developed really allows students to\ntake skills from a basic level and to use their creative thought to put their\nown spin on it. So you\u2019ll find students coming out of our programme who not\nonly have the technical skills, but who can also think quite creatively.\u201d\n\nStudents are then provided with the skills they need to market themselves and\ntheir products. This includes how to take professional photos, create a\nwebsite, and how to use social media effectively.\n\nHead of the British Academy of Jewellery, Sofie Boons, details: \u201cWe\u2019ve focused\non making sure those technical skills are still there but we\u2019re also really\ninterested in making sure that graduates are able to take part in this new\njewellery industry, which also requires digital skills, to be business savvy\nand to know how to market products.\n\n\u201cJust knowing the technical skills is now not enough to get a career. So\nthat\u2019s what our collaboration with SQA was all about \u2013 to build new programmes\nwhich enable students to succeed in this new industry.\u201d\n\nThe Levels 3 and 4 were launched this year, with Levels 5 and 6 becoming\navailable over the next two years.\n\nQualifications manager at SQA, Anne Boyd, says the Diploma offers students a\nnew pathway into the industry. She states:\u201cBy the time we put the level 6 in\nplace, what we\u2019ll have is a progressive framework of qualifications, which\nwill take them from absolute beginner to complete professional, and that\u2019s\nreally exciting.\u201d\n\nThe course is available in Birmingham and London's Hatton Garden.\n\nTags : [BAJ](https://www.professionaljeweller.com/tag/baj/ \"BAJ\")[British\nAcademy of

a\nsurvey by the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG).\n\nThe survey revealed 7.4 per cent of geoscientists were unemployed in Australia\nduring the fourth quarter of 2019, which marked a marginal increase from the\n7.3 per cent unemployment rate in the third quarter.\n\nNew South Wales saw a significant drop in geoscientist unemployment, with\nrates plummeting from 7.9 per cent in September to 2.8 per cent in December.\n\nWhile geoscientist unemployment is dropping, the survey found that\nimprovements will take time.\n\n\u201cThe unemployment rate amongst geoscientists in Australia remains on a\ndownward trend,\u201d Australian Institute of Geoscientists president Andrew Waltho\nsaid.\n\n\u201cAny improvement in employment opportunities for professional geoscientists in\nAustralia is welcome news.\u201d\n\nJob diversity among geoscientists is believed to have stabilised the\nunemployment rate.\n\nThe survey found popular job sectors for geoscientists are dependent on the\nstate they work in.\n\nMineral exploration and mining have employed the highest number of\ngeoscientists in Western Australia and Victoria, while Queensland\u2019s\ngeoscientist jobs mainly stem from energy resource exploration and production.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s professional institutes and societies continue to provide a wide\nrange of accessible, professional development opportunities for members,\nenabling unemployed members to maintain their qualifications and professional\nnetworks to help ensure that they remain \u2018work-ready\u2019,\u201d Waltho said.\n\nNew fields are emerging for geoscientists, including environmental and\nengineering geology according to the survey.\n\nAs geoscientist unemployment rates gradually drop, long-term unemployment\nstill poses an issue.\n\nAn estimated 43 per cent of unemployed respondents reported being out of work\nfor more than 12 months, the survey found.\n\n\u201cLong-term unemployment amongst geoscientists remains a major problem, with\nmore than one third of those currently without work having been unemployed for\nmore than two years,\u201d Waltho said.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s professional institutes and societies continue to provide a wide\nrange of accessible, professional development opportunities for members,\nenabling unemployed members to maintain their qualifications and professional\nnetworks to help ensure that they remain \u2018work-ready.\u201d\n\nThe 395 responses the survey received represent one in 20 Australian\ngeoscientists.\n\nTo keep up to date with

Proven Ways to Make Yourself Work-Ready\n\n#  Proven Ways to Make Yourself Work-Ready\n\n**19 August 2019** \\- [****](/insights/news?author=)\n\n#### ![Trainers](/~/media/Images/Insights/Proven-ways-to-make-yourself-work-\nready.jpg)You\u2019re about to enter the world of work. What steps do you need to\ntake to ensure your success?\n\n****\n\n**Rosie Gailor**\n\n### PART 1: THE APPLICATION PROCESS\n\n**FINDING A GREAT JOB**\n\n[When writing your\nCV](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/the-easy-to-miss-\ndetails-companies-want-you-to-leave-off-your-cv) and cover letter, think of\nwhere you can transfer your theoretical skills: if you\u2019ve managed or helped to\norganise a sports team, you can apply organisational skills; if you excel in\nwritten exams, you can work well under pressure; if you contributed to student\nmedia, you can manage your time effectively and are dependable. Where can you\nuse what you\u2019ve already learned, and [where would you love to use\nit?](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/three-steps-to-\nfiguring-out-your-career) Think about what aspects of your studying experience\nyou\u2019ve most enjoyed, or perhaps a sector that you are keen to learn about.\nThis is a solid starting point to your job hunt, and gives you a direction of\ntravel when thinking of where to start looking, should you not have a specific\nrole in mind.\n\n**SCRUB UP**\n\nWe don\u2019t just mean get that long-overdue haircut -- scrub up your social media\nprofiles. Make them private, delete those drunken Tweets, and remove any\npotentially reputation-damaging photos from the public realm. Make sure your\nLinkedIn is in tip-top shape and full of all the details included in your CV,\nwith an up-to-date photo and relevant contact details. Recruiters and\nemployers use [LinkedIn as well as\nCVs](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/may/how-to-boost-your-\nemployability) and cover letters, so it\u2019s best to make your profiles squeaky\nclean.\n\n**THE INTERVIEW**\n\n[The interview](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/how-to-\ninterview-well) is a great opportunity not only to showcase [your\nskills](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/june/how-to-spot-your-\nstrengths-and-weaknesses) in greater detail, but to show that you\u2019re a great\npersonality fit with the company. Think back to why you applied initially --\nwhat made you want to work there? Look at their values and measure them\nagainst your own, and talk about this in the interview. Practise with your\nfriends or in the mirror, read up on common interview questions, and remember\nto be yourself. This is as much an opportunity for you to get a feel for the\ncompany as it is for them to get to know you. Read more on how to ace job\ninterviews for successful and practical techniques.\n\n### PART 2: THE FIRST DAY, WEEK, MONTH\n\n**GETTING TO KNOW YOU**\n\nBefore going into a working environment, really think about your [personality\ntraits](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/do-you-need-a-\nskills-plan). Perhaps you\u2019re more introverted than extroverted \u2013 how can you\naccommodate this while still approaching people with questions or introducing\nyourself? If extroverted, how can you make sure your personality shines\nthrough while being professional in a working environment? Come up with a\npreemptive action plan to accommodate for situations you may find\nuncomfortable or parts of the role you anticipate needing help with. How well\ndo you react to stress? Are you ready to admit to making a mistake? [Do you\nwork well in a team but struggle on your\nown?](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/june/how-to-ask-for-help-\nwith-work) Identifying these potential issues ahead of time can help you\nmentally prepare to ask for help when you need it. Remember, your team are\nthere to help you adjust in the first few months and can help you fully grasp\nyour duties and tools. Taking the time to understand your personality and\nworking traits can help you build [great working relationships with your\nteam](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/june/how-to-build-a-\ngreat-working-relationship).\n\n**LOOK FORWARDS**\n\nUsing your current job spec, use the key skills to identify your key strengths\nand weaknesses. Which skills do you excel at or have no experience in? [How\ncan you improve upon these gaps in\nknowledge](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/do-you-need-a-\nskills-plan), and how can you ask to learn or hone these skills in your new\nrole? Try not to get complacent in your current position \u2013 there\u2019s always\nsomething to learn.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth thinking about whether it\u2019s possible to find a mentor --\neither inside your new organisation or outside of it. Companies like [Find a\nMentor](http://www.mentorsme.co.uk/finding-a-mentor) or [Meet-a-\nMentor](https://meetamentor.co.uk/) can help you find someone externally, and\nif you become[ a member of CMI](https://www.managers.org.uk/join-online) we\nconnect you with well-established players as part of our [Achieve mentoring\nprogramme](https://www.managers.org.uk/individuals/existing-members/mentoring)\nso you can ask them any questions you may have.\n\n**LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT ETIQUETTE**\n\nThere\u2019s office etiquette, and then there\u2019s coworking skills: communication,\npersonal conduct and attitude within the office. Make yourself a great team\nmember and person to be around. Show initiative -- especially in your first\nday, or weeks, don\u2019t sit around and twiddle your thumbs while you wait for\nsomeone to give you a task. Be inquisitive, ask for work, do your own research\nand look around the file organisation and tools that your new colleagues use\ndaily. Take note of how they interact with each other; if they\u2019re not a\ntalkative bunch, don\u2019t try and force conversation. Equally, if they are\nnaturally chatty, don\u2019t get carried away and prioritise socialising above\ncompleting your work. Office etiquette is vital to making sure you gel within\na team and the wider organisation.\n\n**_Still thinking about your future?

Changing with the times\n\n**[Dan\nRemenyi](https://www.universityworldnews.com/fullsearch.php?mode=search&writer=Dan+Remenyi)**\n08 February 2020\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nUniversities have been important institutions in society for a very long time.\nThey provided a wide range of people with the education they needed to pursue\nprofessional careers. This approach was so successful that it was taken for\ngranted that getting a university education is a \u2018good thing\u2019 and offers a\nrelatively fast track to success.  \n  \nBut times have changed. With the exception of elite universities, graduates\nare no longer quite as certain of obtaining a good job as before. The labour\nmarket is much more competitive and there is a greater emphasis on instant\nresults.  \n  \nLeaders in commerce and industry have been critical of universities for not\nproducing work-ready graduates. In addition, the intense focus on research in\nthe modern university may not necessarily have had a positive impact on\nuniversity teaching.  \n  \nWithin universities there has been some disquiet about management practices,\nincluding the remuneration packages awarded to vice-chancellors and other high\noffice bearers. Student debt has become a major problem in some parts of the\nworld.  \n  \nSo what should we do?  \n  \n**The changing university**  \n  \nIn the first place we need to understand that universities have become large\nmulti-product, multi-process and multifunctional businesses. This change has\nbeen largely imposed on them because government funding has not been as\ngenerous as in previous years. Institutions today are quite different from\nuniversities 50 years ago and we need to understand this.  \n  \nIt is also important to emphasise that universities should be about education,\neducation, education and that it is essential to ensure that the essence of\neducation is understood.  \n  \nEducation is not so much about transferring facts and figures or skills. It is\ncertainly not about getting learners to memorise blocks of information.\nEducation is about developing a mindset where the learner realises his or her\nability to face challenging situations and come up with satisfactory solutions\nto problems. Of course, knowledge is required to achieve this, but students\nneed more than knowledge.  \n  \nBecoming work-ready is not a good reason to go to university, but there is no\ndoubt that becoming work-savvy, which requires _inter alia_ an achievement\nmindset, is a very useful thing.  \n  \nIt has been known for a long time that attending lectures is one of the least\neffective ways of learning. So learning by doing has to be the main way\nforward and working alongside accomplished practitioners has much to offer.\nThe \u2018University of the Future\u2019 will therefore place a greater emphasis on\ncollaboration with practitioners.  \n  \nUniversities have to be careful not to jam-pack their students\u2019 days with\nwork, though. University is a time for individual exploration through\ndiscussion with others and reading works that broaden the mind.  \n  \n**A different way to examine knowledge**  \n  \nThen there is how we examine knowledge. Like lectures, traditional\nexaminations often do not really test what students know in any depth.\nStudents anticipate exam questions and learn answers to previously asked\nquestions off by heart.  \n  \nIt has been said that in ancient China admission to the civil service was\nhighly competitive, requiring many years of study and a day-long examination.\nThe interesting thing is that the examination question was always the same\nevery year and it was well known to everyone. The question went something like\nthis: \u201cWrite down what you know which demonstrates that you are worthy of a\nposition in your country\u2019s administration.\u201d  \n  \nToday a similar question for those about to graduate might be: \u201cWrite down\nwhat you know about economics or mathematics or civil engineering or whatever\nyour subject is which will allow this university to be confident that you are\nworthy of being awarded a degree.\u201d This approach to examinations, if correctly\napplied, would help make a university education much more relevant.  \n  \n**Giving back**  \n  \nIt is clear that the University of the Future will be different to what it is\ntoday. But it is essential not to forget the achievements of the past.\nUniversities have made remarkable contributions to improving peoples\u2019 lives.  \n  \nUniversities have often been at the forefront of developing new ideas, new\nprocesses and new products. Universities have encouraged individuals who have\ngone on to become leaders in all walks of life. And universities, through\nbringing together young and enthusiastic individuals, have drawn attention to\nour need to aspire to a better way of life.  \n  \nWe must not forget, however, that attending university is a privilege.\nIrrespective of who pays for it, the experience of higher education is very\nexpensive. Those who obtain a degree need to be aware of the requirement to\nput something into the society which has facilitated their intellectual\ndevelopment.  \n  \nUniversities do not emphasise this enough today. No one can ever really pay\nback the help they receive to grow and succeed, but everyone can pay it\nforward and help others to achieve their potential.  \n  \n_Professor Dan Remenyi is co-editor and contributor to the newly published\nbook_ The University of the Future _, ISBN: 978-1-912764-51-8.

Additionally, [more than a third of human resources\nleaders](https://workplacetrends.com/closing-the-skills-gap-study/) agree\ncolleges are most responsible for getting an employee work ready.\n\nThe tension between teaching to a test and preparing students to be life ready\nis an unfortunate dilemma facing education today. The ultimate focus should be\non career readiness, but the short-term focus of test scores is getting in the\nway.\n\n[More than 40 percent of companies](https://workplacetrends.com/closing-the-\nskills-gap-study/) have not collaborated with colleges to make the curriculum\nmore responsive to workplace needs. As a result, almost a third of colleges do\nnot have a pipeline of talent with the right skills to fill employers' current\nand future roles.\n\n[Nearly half of employers](https://workplacetrends.com/closing-the-skills-gap-\nstudy/) attribute unfilled job openings to a lack of qualified candidates.\nYet, [74 percent of companies](https://workplacetrends.com/closing-the-skills-\ngap-study/) are investing only $500 per employee on training and development\nbetween upskilling and reskilling. (Upskilling is learning new competencies to\nstay in a current role or adding certain competencies for career progression.\nReskilling is learning new sets of competencies to transition to a completely\nnew role.)\n\nThe bottom line is colleges aren't preparing Gen-Z for jobs, and companies\naren't investing enough in training Gen-Z.\n\n[LinkedIn recently determined \"the hard and soft skills companies need\nmost\"](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/trends-and-\nresearch/2018/the-most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills-of-2018) by looking at\nskills that are in high demand relative to their supply. Demand was measured\nby identifying the skills listed on the LinkedIn profiles of people who are\ngetting hired at the highest rates.\n\nBelow are the skills colleges should focus on and employers should hire and/or\ntrain for.\n\n## The most in-demand soft skills:\n\n _\"Soft skills\" are personality traits and behaviors._\n\n  1. **Creativity:** While robots are great at optimizing old ideas, organizations most need creative employees who can conceive the solutions of tomorrow with [relevancy and novelty](https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/top-skills/why-creativity-is-the-most-important-skill-in-the-world?trk=lilblog_01-01-19_skills-companies-need-most_tl&cid=70132000001AyziAAC).\n  2. **Persuasion:** Having a great product, a great platform, or a great concept is one thing, but the key is persuading people to buy into it.\n  3. **Collaboration:** As projects grow increasingly more complex and global in the age of AI, effective collaboration grows only more important.\n  4. **Adaptability:** An adaptable mind is an essential tool for navigating today's ever-changing world, as yesterday's solutions won't solve tomorrow's problems.\n  5. **Time management:** A timeless skill, mastering time management is career enhancing and highly useful in today's distraction-filled world.\n\n## The most in-demand hard skills:\n\n _\"Hard skills\" concern one's ability to do a specific task._\n\n  1. **Cloud computing:** As the world rushes toward the cloud, companies are desperately searching for engineers who have the skills to accommodate this demand.\n  2. **Artificial intelligence:** The age of AI is here and growing fast.\n  3. **Analytical reasoning:** As they collect more data than ever before, companies are hungry for professionals who can make smart decisions based off it.\n  4. **People management:** The world has changed from a \"command-and-control\" model toward leaders who can coach and empower, a difficult skill set few professionals possess.\n  5. **UX design:** UX design is the key to making a digital world work for humans.\n  6. **Mobile application development:** A skill that's been in-demand for several years as companies continue to design mobile-first platforms.\n  7. **Video production:** Demand for video production is spiking as streaming represents [70 percent of all consumer internet traffic](https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/top-skills/the-skills-companies-need-most-in-2019--and-how-to-learn-them).\n  8. **Sales leadership:** Sales is one of those skills that's always in-demand, and great sales leaders are only becoming harder to find.\n  9. **Translation:** We are more connected globally than ever before, with translation skills breaking down one of the last remaining barriers: language.\n  10. **Audio production:** Similar to video, there's been a spike in interest in podcasts and other audio digital formats recently, leading to increased demand for this skill.\n\nPublished on: Jul 17, 2019\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from

from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) has shown that\ngraduates entering the employment market will materially boost their chances\nof employment and earning potential by gaining qualifications in management\nand leadership.\n\nCMI's previous[ 21st Century Leaders Report\n](https://www.managers.org.uk/~/media/Files/Reports/insights/research/21st_Century_Leaders_CMI_Feb2018.pdf)found\nthat employers want new recruits to be work-ready with professional management\nskills and behaviours. This report explores the interplay between employers,\nhigher education institutions, students and other learners, and the role of\nprofessional bodies in championing learners' professional development to the\nhighest possible standards. These will also strengthen graduates and\nprospective students, who need resilience and transferable team and self-\nmanagement skills to tackle a changing world of work.\n\nIn a Graduate Outcomes Survey of students recently graduated from CMI-\naccredited courses, CMI has found that 87% of survey respondents were\neconomically active six months after graduation. 94% of graduates who were\neconomically active at the time of the survey were employed in a professional\nrole.\n\nThe majority of respondents felt that CMI-accredited degrees gave them a\ncompetitive edge in the job application process, skills to be productive in\ntheir new jobs, and good career prospects.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1Or1kRalDRB_4nhlVOjEg4O3UiYR7l_mFb3CNjA2vViRBF3771C1LzudmcjGfVZTM1ia0kjrwdWDmUdPrBlzcX3ES-\nyu5rViQJzxg70rc_Syf4-TdO91fCq3yVm8wmFf4b8iWL2H)\n\n**Steve Heappey, Director of Partnership Engagement, said:**\n\n\"It is brilliant to see that graduates of CMI-accredited courses are getting\nthe most out of their education. We know that good management and leadership\nskills are vital for the success of both employers and employees, and CMI is\nproud to be helping students and graduates advance their careers and feel\nready to enter the ever-evolving world of work.\"\n\nAnalysis of DHLE (Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education) data has\nalready demonstrated that CMI-accredited degrees boost employability by 10%\ncompared to non-accredited degrees. Additionally, the vast majority of\ngraduates agreed that they were gaining valuable management and leadership\nskills from their CMI-accredited degree.\n\n**Corey Kemp, Project Management Officer, Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership,\nBournemouth University:**\n\n\"CMI helped me to think outside of the academic environment, where there is an\nemphasis on 'knowing your stuff'. A wealth of management material and CPD\nresources indicated that you need to have a working skillset to adapt to the\nworking environment. This is the value of being a CMI member: you become a\nwell-rounded professional, not just an academic.\"\n\n**Danielle Keeling ACMI, Personal Tax Assistant, EY:**\n\n\"I truly believe that my decision to study a CMI accredited degree was\ninstrumental in helping me to secure my first role... I was looking for a\ncourse that would offer me something that would help me stand out to employers\n- and that is exactly what I found.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n![](https://www.fenews.co.uk//modules/mod_ijoomla_adagency_zone/tmpl/blocker-\nquestion.png) How to resolve AdBlock issue?\n\nYou are using adblocker please support us by whitelisting www.fenews.co.uk\n\nRefresh this page\n\n[![Top drama school offers for Gower College Swansea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Acting Company\nstudents](/images/user_images/GCSNews/Ethan_web.jpg)](/press-\nreleases/45146-top-drama-school-offers-for-acting-company-students-2)\n\nSector News\n\nStudents on @GowerCollegeSwa nseaa\u0080\u0099s Acting Company course are celebr\n\n[![Top drama school offers for Acting Company\nstudents](/images/gcs_750x570.jpg)](/press-releases/45139-top-drama-school-\noffers-for-acting-company-students)\n\nSector News\n\nStudents on Gower College Swanseaa\u0080\u0099s Acting Company course are celebr\n\n[![University of Bristol accommodation given to NHS\nstaff](/images/bristol_uni.jpg)](/press-releases/45141-university-of-bristol-\naccommodation-given-to-nhs-staff)\n\nSector News\n\nOne hundred rooms in the Universitya\u0080\u0099s student accommodation at 33 Co\n\n**Dr Katerina Sidiropoulou, Course Leader BSc(Hons) Business Management, ARU\nCambridge:**\n\n\"As a Course Leader I want to ensure that all my students will start their\nprofessional career on a level playing field. Studying a CMI-accredited\nrecognised business course not only boosts graduates' confidence by enabling\nthem to aim higher but also embraces their aspirations and encourages them to\nunfold the potential of their talents and abilities to the fullest in such a\ncompetitive job market.\"\n\n**Methodology:** The Graduate Outcomes Survey explored graduate outcomes with\nrecent graduates from CMI-accredited degrees, and was conducted between 5th\nAugust and 9th September 2019. CMI members who graduated with a CMI-accredited\ndegree between 2015 and 2019 were contacted: 131 graduates responded.\n\nYou are now being logged in using your Facebook

The\nproblem with modern internships)\n\nInternships are an important part of the student learning process. Source:\nShutterstock\n\n# Priceless or worthless? The problem with modern internships\n\nBy  [Study International\nStaff](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/author/study-international-\nstaff/) | October 15, 2019 ![](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/12/apple-touch-icon-2.png)\n\n8\n\nSOCIAL BUZZ\n\nThe benefits of internships have been widely reported. They help narrow the\nskills gap to ensure students are graduate-ready, as well as offering a\nplatform to put theory into practice, network with professionals and learn\nabout possible career paths, and these are just a handful of benefits.\n\nFor instance, one [study](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/222497/why-\ncolleges-internships-requirement.aspx) suggested that graduates who had\nundergone an internship or who had a relevant job while studying \u201cwere more\nthan twice as likely to acquire a good job immediately after graduation\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore than four in 10 of these graduates (42 percent) who strongly agree they\nhad a relevant job or internship as an undergraduate had a good job waiting\nfor them upon graduation, compared with just 20 percent of those who did not\nstrongly agree,\u201d it said.\n\nDepending on the university, internships can be optional or a requirement for\na student to graduate. Students may be able to commit to an internship on a\nfull- or part-time basis, depending on the company.\n\nBut while many may wax lyrical about the benefits of internships, there are\nalso common issues that can negatively impact students, some of which include:\n\n## Internships are not financially viable for _all_ students\n\nNot all internships are paid, while some pay very little, putting students\nfrom a lower socio-economic backgrounds, who need to work to support\nthemselves, at a disadvantage. Wealthier students or those who have financial\nsupport can afford to undertake unpaid internships, while this is hardly a\nviable option for those who don't have such support.\n\n## Some employers under utilise interns\n\n![photocopy  ](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/photocopy.jpg)\n\n_Some students are left performing menial tasks for the entire duration of\ntheir internship, and are fully aware that what they do on a daily basis is\nnot the coveted real-life experience. Source: Shutterstock_\n\nWhile internships are common across universities, there are numerous reports\nof interns being under utilised during their internship. They are often asked\nto undertake tasks such as fetching coffee or doing clerical work, which\ncontributes abysmally to their professional development and doesn't help them\ndevelop work-ready skills.\n\nIn the [_New Straits\nTimes_](https://www.nst.com.my/education/2018/12/439795/getting-best-out-\ninternships) , Accenture Malaysia Strategic Engagement Director, Ebi Azly\nAbdullah, opined: \u201cInterns have different capabilities and experience. Some\nare more than capable of handling difficult tasks. Some need more guidance.\nMonitor their progress and nurture them.\n\n\u201cI treat interns as equal to the other team members. I test them to see their\nreaction to challenges. And the good ones will normally be absorbed into the\ncompany.\u201d\n\nThis brings us to our next point:\n\n## Students don't necessarily benefit from some internships\n\nOrganisations often look for graduates with industry experience, but this can\nbe challenging for those who are stuck in an unstructured internship where\nthey are not given an opportunity to be exposed to the ins and out of the\nworkplace, or who are given little to no guidance or training on the job and\nultimately, failing to benefit fully from the experience.\n\n## Students in rural areas may have limited opportunities for professional\ndevelopment\n\n![photocopy  Scott-Eisen-Getty-Images-North-America-AFP-1024x683\n](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-\nEisen-Getty-Images-North-America-AFP-1024x683.jpg)\n\n_Students in rural areas may have fewer internship opportunities. Source:\nScott Eisen/AFP_\n\nNot all students choose to study in universities located in major cities, be\nit for financial or other personal reasons. But this can become an issue for\nthose who need an internship to graduate, but have limited opportunities to do\nso in geographically disadvantaged areas.\n\nHence, they may need to temporarily relocate to areas with better internship\nopportunities, which brings us back to the fact that internships are not\nalways a financially viable option for certain segments of students,\nparticularly those lower down the economic ladder.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that while internships hold so much potential, they can also prove\nto be a bane when there's a disconnect between an organisation's readiness to\nprovide interns with the right professional development. Universities that\nmake internships a requirement for students to graduate should support\nstudents in finding a suitable placement, or in advising students when\nconfronted with difficulties during their internship.\n\n## **Liked this?

youth will be getting help with **digital education** ; a\nmultinational information technology firm is bringing the renowned **P-TECH\neducation model** to the nation.\n\nThe collaboration is aimed at better connecting high school and university\nyouth to industry leaders in an effort to develop stronger academic, technical\nand work-ready skills among Malaysian youth.\n\nTo enable this an agreement was\n[inked](https://www.cso.com.au/mediareleases/36397/ibm-introduces-p-tech-in-\nmalaysia-to-address/) between the company\u2019s Malaysia branch, the Ministry of\nEducation and [Malaysia](https://www.opengovasia.com/malaysia/) Digital\nEconomy Corporation (MDEC).\n\nCurrently, Malaysia is experiencing a shortage of ICT and STEM skills as a\nresult of industries being reshaped by data science, AI, cloud computing and\ncybersecurity.\n\nThe 2019 Malaysia Salary Guide stated that Malaysia is facing challenges in\nbuilding its digital workforce, as reflected in the fast-growing demand for\ndigital talent despite a comparative shortfall in supply.\n\nThe Vice President, Tech Talent Development at MDEC stated that this\ncollaboration will serve as an intervention at a crucial point in students\u2019\nschooling lives \u2013 the age of 16 \u2013 and will go a long way to bridge the gap and\nequip students with technical skills that are underpinned by essential\ncommunication basics to succeed in their careers.\n\nThrough the P-TECH model, high schools, tertiary-level universities, and\nindustry partners collaborate to enable students to earn recognized\nuniversity-level credentials that provide a direct path to competitive, in-\ndemand STEM careers in all industries.\n\nStudents pursue tech-related Malaysia Vocational and **Malaysia Skills\ndiplomas** in applied science, engineering, computers or other in-demand STEM\ndisciplines, while simultaneously building professional skills through\nmentorships, site visits, and paid internships, culminating in interviews for\nappropriate job opportunities.\n\nEstablished in 2011, P-TECH has been introduced in 24 countries including the\nU.S.A., Australia, New Zealand, Morocco, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Philippines\nand Thailand.\n\nP-TECH is expected to reach 220 schools worldwide by the end of 2019, with\nmore than 600 industry partners supporting the initiative. It is a response to\nthe growing recognition that for many emerging, unfilled technology-related\nroles; flexible, relevant credentials and skills are paramount.\n\nP-TECH students in Malaysia will be supported to complete a five-year\nstructured programme at high school and in tertiary education.\n\nSuccessful students will be able to step easily into high-growth, \"new collar\"\njobs. These jobs are positions in some of the most rapidly-expanding\nindustries, where having in-demand technical and professional workplace\nskills, adaptability and recognized credentials are what matter most.\n\nSekolah Menengah Vokasional (SMV) Sepang and SMV Sungai Buloh will begin pilot\nP-TECH programmes in 2020, with the tech firm and MDEC as strategic partners.\n\nP-TECH education will begin for approximately 60 students in both vocational\nschools. The programme is expected to grow as more employers, high schools and\ntertiary-level universities join.\n\nThe partnership will see high schools, tertiary educational institutions and\nindustry players collaborating to ensure work-readiness and develop in-demand\ncredentials and skills that employers need now and in the future.\n\nThe tech firm expressed gratitude for the support it is receiving from the\nMinistry of Education and is excited to partner SMV Sepang, and SMV Sungai\nBuloh and MDEC to bring P-TECH to life in Malaysia.\n\nThe agreement will create new learning pathways directly to new collar jobs\nand help students better understand the connection between their coursework,\nfield experiences and the workplace.\n\nTags: [Digital Education in

Technologies like robotics, automation and\nartificial intelligence (AI) are shaping just about every aspect of our lives,\nfrom how we live to how we work. In these rapidly evolving times, those who\nfail to innovate or upskill risk falling behind.\n\nRapid technological advancements make the [automation of\njobs](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)\nin the future a valid concern. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important, now more than ever,\nfor the current and future workforce to be equipped with the necessary skills\nand experience to thrive in this unprecedented era. A report from the\n[National Academies of Sciences](https://www.nap.edu/read/24649/chapter/1#xiv)\n[notes](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/03/the-future-of-jobs-and-jobs-\ntraining/): \u201cThe education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals\nfor the changing labour market.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, universities must keep abreast of the changing times and\nequip students with the right skills to excel in the future job market. One of\nthe ways universities can produce agile graduates is through 'Work Integrated\nLearning' (WIL), which challenges students to put theory into practice and\nhelp graduates flex their skills and ease their transition into the future\nworkforce.\n\nFor students, these opportunities don\u2019t only serve as valuable work\nexperience, but can also boost CVs and enhance graduate employability. So, for\nprospective students seeking a university that will prepare them for the\nfuture workplace, here are four worth considering:\n\n[**THE EDUCATION UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG\n(EdUHK)**](https://www.eduhk.hk/main/)\n\n\ufeff  \nEdUHK proudly nurtures outstanding and caring educators and professionals with\nits holistic learning framework that promotes students\u2019 whole personal\ndevelopment. This includes incorporating multidisciplinary programmes,\ndelivering quality courses and innovative curricula as well as built-in field\nexperiences and internship opportunities.\n\nStellar curricula aside, the university also introduces non-formal learning\ncomponents to support students\u2019 personal and professional development. To\nbetter equip students to become caring global citizens, its [Student Affairs\nOffice](https://www.eduhk.hk/sao/) runs various [global\nexposure](https://www.eduhk.hk/sao/?p=4420) programmes that aim to nurture\ntheir multicultural competency and dynamic leadership skills.\n\nFor example, its Leadership Enhancement and Development Programme sees\nstudents participating in workcamps in developing countries, while its\niAmbassador Programme promotes internationalisation and cultural integration.\nThere are also [cultural\ntours](https://www.eduhk.hk/spfeo/view.php?secid=52969&u=u) to countries such\nas Finland, Japan and the US to widen students\u2019 horizons.\n\nFor prospective language teachers at EdUHK, its academic faculties and\ndepartments supplement classroom learning with a [language immersion\nprogramme](https://www.eduhk.hk/acadprog/pgde/immersion.htm), which enhances\nstudents\u2019 English or Putonghua proficiency to ensure their future teaching\nsuccess.\n\nThe university\u2019s prowess in producing highly skilled and employable graduates\nis cemented by the results of its latest [Graduate Employment\nSurvey](https://www.eduhk.hk/main/media/press-release/929), which shows 99\npercent of graduates from the Bachelor of Education programmes were employed\nor had chosen to further their studies within three months of graduation.\nTheir average monthly salary registered a year-on-year increase of 7.1\npercent.\n\n### [**LA TROBE UNIVERSITY**](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/)\n\n\ufeff  \nThis public university in Melbourne, Australia, opened its doors in 1967 and\nhas since built itself an international reputation. It stands [among the\nworlds\u2019 top 350 universities](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-\nuniversity-rankings/la-trobe-university), based on the _Times Higher Education\n(THE) World University Rankings 2019_.\n\nMost of La Trobe\u2019s degrees provide students with an opportunity to complete\n[WIL](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/students/opportunities/wil-\nplacements/options) to help them hone their skills. This can be [in the form\nof](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/study/undergrad/why-study-at-la-trobe) an\ninternship, clinical placement or a subject that embeds students in a\nworkplace setting.\n\nFor example, La Trobe\u2019s WIL or Industry Based Learning (IBL) acts as an\noptional practical learning opportunity that enables students to apply what\nthey\u2019ve learnt within the workplace. Benefits of completing a WIL include\nbuilding your network, improving your employability through work experience\nand learning more about your future career.\n\nThere are also [elective\nplacements](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/students/opportunities/wil-\nplacements/elective-placements) that enable students to explore La Trobe\u2019s\nelective opportunities to gain work-relevant experience for credit with the\nuniversity\u2019s industry and community partners.\n\nAs a testament to the university\u2019s prowess, La Trobe ranks well for\n[employability](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/about/rankings-and-ratings), coming\n14th in Australia and 4th in Victoria (and in the top 300 universities\nglobally) in the 2018/2019 QS Graduate Employability Rankings. The university\nalso enjoys a healthy employment rate; La Trobe ranks 9th in Australia and\n129th in the world for the number of graduates in full or part-time employment\nwithin 12 months of graduation.\n\n### [**AUCKLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (AUT)**](https://www.aut.ac.nz/)\n\n  \nNestled in Auckland, New Zealand, AUT produces work-ready graduates. With\nglobal industry partnerships 5,000-strong and alumni who live and work in 80\ncountries, this comes as no surprise.\n\nAt AUT, learning isn\u2019t confined to the classroom. The Kiwi university offers\nWIL for all students, which involves a partnership between the student,\nindustry and university to create collaborative learning opportunities through\nthe exchange of ideas, practices and experiences.\n\nThe WIL model serves as an integration of knowledge gained in the university\nwith knowledge accessed or constructed through workplace experience, notes the\n[website](https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/sport-and-\nrecreation/research/co-operative-education-and-work-integrated-learning). This\ncooperative education and other forms of WIL as part of a degree programme\nhave been shown to develop capabilities that enhance the employability of\ngraduates.\n\nWIL is the final part of a students\u2019 degree, regardless of their major, and\ntakes a full semester. This supervised work placement is related to a\nstudents\u2019 major(s), for an organisation of their choice, which can ensure\nstudents leave work-ready upon graduation.\n\nMeanwhile, AUT has been steadily climbing the\n[rankings](https://www.aut.ac.nz/about/rankings-and-accreditation). _THE World\nUniversity Rankings 2019_ ranks AUT among the worlds\u2019 [top 350\nuniversities](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/auckland-university-technology), while in the Asia-Pacific University\nRanking 2019, AUT is ranked as number 51. The university also has over 250\nbachelor\u2019s, graduate diplomas, master\u2019s, MBAs and PhDs to choose from across a\nrange of fields, setting students up for successful careers around the world.\n\n### [**CURTIN UNIVERSITY**](https://www.curtin.edu.au/)\n\n  \nDespite only being founded in 1987, this leading Australian university has\ndeveloped a global reputation for its education and research excellence.\nCurtin is ranked in the [top one percent](https://about.curtin.edu.au/who/) of\nuniversities worldwide in the [Academic Ranking of World Universities\n2018](http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2018.html) and has campuses across\nthe globe, including in Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore and the\nUnited Arab Emirates.\n\nThe institution offers a variety of [undergraduate and graduate\ncourses](https://study.curtin.edu.au/study-options/), including double degrees\nfor students looking to specialise in two areas of study.\n\nWIL has been integrated into [all Curtin\ncourses](https://engage.curtin.edu.au/industry/work-integrated-learning/) to\nensure graduates have the skills and practical experience demanded by\nindustries. This is done through Curtin\u2019s professional, community and\ngovernment partnerships, enabling students to contribute to the workplace\nwhile also strengthening their skills, expanding their industry knowledge and\nincreasing their employability.\n\nCurtin offers [fieldwork\neducation](http://www2.curtin.edu.au/learningfortomorrow/industry_skilled/work-\nintegrated-learning.cfm), a form of WIL, designed to provide real-world\nexperience to better prepare students for professional work after graduation.\nFieldwork activities can include units or courses that require a work\nplacement or workplace activities; participation in laboratories; as well as\nstudy tours, field trips/camps, among others.\n\n_THE_ ranks Curtin in the [301\u2013350th\nband](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/curtin-\nuniversity) in the _World University Rankings 2019_.\n\n_*Some of the institutions featured in this article are commercial partners of\nStudy International_\n\n## Liked this?

Translating your everyday skills to the workplace\n\n#  Translating your everyday skills to the workplace\n\n**08 November 2019** \\- [****](/insights/news?author=)\n\n#### ![Person holding briefcase](/~/media/Images/Insights/CMI-Translating-\nyour-everyday-skills-to-the-workplace.jpg)You may not know it, but you don\u2019t\nneed specific experience to show that you\u2019re work-ready \u2013 here are all the\nways your day-to-day skills make you a great candidate\n\n****\n\n**Rosie Gailor**\n\nWhen sitting down to write your CV for the first time, it can be challenging\nto know where to start, especially if you\u2019ve not had any previous experience.\nYet, you may have more skills in your arsenal than you\u2019d originally thought \u2013\nall of your experiences in life so far will have helped you to hone and polish\nparts of yourself that you can use to sell yourself to a potential employer.\nWhether you\u2019ve gone down the university route, the apprentice route, or\nstraight into the world of work, these are the skills you can boast about in\nyour cv and your interview.\n\nSo how exactly do you translate these everyday skills into professional\nexperience? CMI talks you through it.\n\n### Problem solving\n\nAny time you\u2019ve overcome a setback, you\u2019ve practised your problem-solving\nskills. Think about any research projects you\u2019ve undertaken at school or\nuniversity, a customer complaint that happened at work, or a hobby that threw\nup unexpected curveballs. You can also talk about the times you\u2019ve shown\ninitiative to overcome problems, such as asking for advice from friends or a\nteacher or mentor, and how you researched into the problem \u2013 like looking up\nvideos online to see how something can be fixed.\n\n### Communication\n\nYou\u2019ve spent your entire life communicating, and believe it or not, this is a\nkey soft skill that employers are seeking. They don\u2019t want someone who can\u2019t\nvocalise ideas, pick up the phone, or write a professional email. Talk about\nyou\u2019ve showcased your communication skills through presentations at school,\nworking in groups for projects, and any part-time customer service work you\u2019ve\nhad. Writing skills can be specifically highlighted through essay-writing\nexperience, blog writing, or creative writing like short stories or poetry.\n\n### Numeracy\n\nWith most jobs, there\u2019s a level of numeracy needed. This may be to analyse\ndata, do number-crunching, or counting money in tills at the end of the day.\nBeing handy with a calculator is a good skill to have in life anyway, so talk\nabout your professional qualifications in maths from school, any cash-counting\nin part-time jobs, or about how you made your own budget for living costs at\nuniversity.\n\n### People skills and teamwork\n\nIf you were part of a drama group, did extra-curricular team sports, or\nvolunteered, you\u2019ve also been polishing up your people skills. Any activity\nthat involves working in a group means you\u2019ve learned how to work\ncollaboratively and supportively, and have learned how to work well with\ndifferent people and various personality types. If you\u2019ve shared accommodation\nwith people \u2013 especially if you didn\u2019t particularly get on with them \u2013 talk\nabout the ways you were a considerate housemate.\n\n### Time management\n\nPerhaps you helped to organise the school yearbook, helped to organise a trip\nwith a large group of friends, or accommodated for essay-writing time in\nexams, you\u2019ve slowly been gaining time-management skills throughout your life.\nFrom the time you were making revision schedules to planning your commute to\nwork or overseeing a large project at university, you\u2019ve used time-management\nskills in different ways throughout your life.\n\n_For more help putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard), we can help\nyou[build a starter\nCV](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2019/july/how-to-build-a-\nstarter-cv).

The model was\nso successful it has been taken for granted that getting a university\neducation is a \u201cgood thing\u201d and would lead to a relatively fast track to\nsuccess.\n\nBut times have changed. With the exception of the elite universities,\ngraduates are no longer quite as certain of obtaining a good job as before.\nThe labour market is much more competitive and there is greater emphasis on\ninstant results.\n\nLeaders in commerce and industry have been critical of universities for not\nproducing work-ready graduates. In addition, the intense focus on research in\nthe modern university is seen as not necessarily having a positive impact on\nthe quality of university teaching.\n\nWithin the universities there has been some disquiet about management\npractices including the remuneration packages awarded to vice-chancellors and\nothers in senior management.\n\nStudent debt has become a major problem in some parts of the world.\n\nSo what has to be done? Well in the first place it is necessary to understand\nthat universities have become large multiproduct, multiprocess, and\nmultifunction businesses.\n\nThis has been largely imposed on them by the fact that government funding has\nnot been as generous as in previous years. Today these institutions are quite\ndifferent from universities 50 years ago. This needs to be understood by\neveryone concerned.\n\nIn doing this, it is important to emphasise that universities have to be about\neducation, education and education \u2013 and it is essential to ensure that the\nessence of education is understood. Education is not so much about\ntransferring facts and figures or skills. It is certainly not about banking\ninformation in the heads of the learners. Education is rather about developing\na mind-set where the learner realises his or her potential and to face\nchallenging situations and come up with satisfactory answers to problems.\n\nOf course, knowledge is required to achieve this, but it needs more than\nknowledge. Becoming work-ready is not the reason to go to university - but\nthere is no doubt becoming work-savvy, which requires inter alia an\nachievement ethos, is a very useful thing.\n\nIt has been known for a long time that attending lectures is one of the least\neffective ways of learning. So learning by doing has to be the way forward and\nfurthermore working \u2013 that is, doing - alongside accomplished practitioners\nhas much to offer. So the University of the Future will amongst other things\nput greater emphasis on collaboration with practitioners.\n\n**Don\u2019t jam pack the day**\n\nUniversities have to be careful not to jam pack their students\u2019 days with\nwork. University years are the time for individual exploration through\ndiscourse with others in similar circumstances and reading works which will\nbroaden the mind.\n\nLike lectures, traditional examinations often do not really establish what\nstudents know in any depth. Students anticipate exam questions and learn\nanswers to previously asked questions off by heart.\n\nIt has been said that in ancient China admission to the civil service was\nhighly competitive, requiring many years of study and a day long examination.\nThe interesting point is that the examination question was always the same\nevery year and furthermore it was well known to everyone. It went something\nlike this, \u201cWrite down what you know that will demonstrate that you are worthy\nof a position in your country\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nToday the final question, in order to graduate from university, could be,\n\u201cWrite down what you know about economics or mathematics or civil engineering,\nor whatever your subject is, which will allow this university to be confident\nthat you are worthy of being awarded a degree.\u201d\n\nThis approach alone to examination, if it were correctly applied, would make a\nmajor contribution to making a university education much relevant.\n\nAttending a university is a privilege. Irrespective of who pays for it, higher\neducation is very expensive. Those who obtain a degree need to be cognisant of\na requirement to put something into the society which has facilitated their\ndevelopment. Universities do not emphasise this enough today. No one can\nreally ever pay back the help received to develop and achieve success, but\neveryone can pay forward and facilitate others achieve their potential.\n\nIt is clear that the University of the Future will be different to what it is\ntoday. But it is essential not to forget the achievements of the past.\nUniversities have made remarkable contributions to improving peoples\u2019 lives.\nUniversities have often led the way in developing new ideas, new processes and\nnew products. Universities have encouraged individuals who have become leaders\nin all walks of life. And through bringing together young and enthusiastic\nindividuals universities have drawn attention to our need to aspire to a\nbetter way of life.\n\n_Professor Dan Remenyi is Co-Editor and contributor to the newly published\nbook[The University of the Future](http://academic-\nbookshop.com/ourshop/prod_6953545-University-of-the-Future.html). _\n\n[ Universities](/categories/universities-0)\n\n[Higher education](/categories/higher-education)\n\n[R&D policy](/categories/rd-policy)\n\n[ Education policy](/categories/education-policy)\n\n_Never miss an update from Science|Business:_ [Newsletter sign-\nup](https://sciencebusiness.net/newsletter-signup)\n\n#### Related News\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/styles/article_thum/public/2020-04/helga-\nnowotny-1_0.jpg?itok=OZ3wp8WD) ](/viewpoint/viewpoint-its-time-coordinate-\nglobal-covid-19-research-effort)\n\n[Viewpoint: It\u2019s time to coordinate the global COVID-19 research\neffort](/viewpoint/viewpoint-its-time-coordinate-global-covid-19-research-\neffort)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/styles/article_thum/public/2020-03/jc-\nburgelman.jpg?itok=HCrCT0EE) ](/viewpoint/viewpoint-covid-19-open-science-and-\nred-alert-health-indicator)\n\n[Viewpoint: COVID-19, open science, and a \u2018red alert\u2019 health\nindicator](/viewpoint/viewpoint-covid-19-open-science-and-red-alert-health-\nindicator)\n\n31 Mar 2020\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/styles/article_thum/public/2020-03/meulien_0.jpg?itok=2JVfaFvp)\n](/viewpoint/viewpoint-hard-lessons-covid-19-will-leave-us-better-prepared-\nnext-pandemic)\n\n[Viewpoint: Hard lessons from COVID-19 will leave us better prepared for the\nnext pandemic ](/viewpoint/viewpoint-hard-lessons-covid-19-will-leave-us-\nbetter-prepared-next-pandemic)\n\n26 Mar 2020\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/styles/article_thum/public/2020-03/alain-\nverbeke.jpg?itok=puH_wU9N) ](/viewpoint/viewpoint-how-negotiate-global-\ncovid-19-vaccine-research-collaboration)\n\n[Viewpoint: how to negotiate global COVID-19 vaccine research\ncollaboration](/viewpoint/viewpoint-how-negotiate-global-covid-19-vaccine-\nresearch-collaboration)\n\n23 Mar 2020\n\n[__   Newsletter sign-up](https://sciencebusiness.net/newsletter-signup)\n\n#### Jobs\n\n[Microsoft seeks a Cyber Security Policy Coordinator -\nBrussels](/jobs/microsoft-seeks-cyber-security-policy-coordinator-brussels)\n\n#### COVID-19 news and resources for researchers\n\n  * [Science|Business Database: Coronavirus Funding Opportunities](https://sciencebusiness.net/list-coronavirus-rd-projects)\n\n  * [LIVE BLOG: R&D response to COVID-19 pandemic](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/live-blog-rd-response-covid-19-pandemic)\n\n  * [Crowdhelix match-making platform for COVID-19 researchers](https://network.crowdhelix.com/covid-19)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### The Network\n\nThe unique forum convening public and private sector leaders for networking,\nintelligence and debates on research and innovation.\n\n[More info](/network)\n\n![network pic](/sites/default/files/inline-images/network-2019%20-%20Copy.JPG)\n\n#### Most Read\n\n  1.

London](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/author/regents-\nuniversity-london/) | December 16, 2016 |\n[@regentsuni](https://twitter.com/regentsuni \"Regent\u2019s University London on\nTwitter\")\n\nIn an increasingly competitive job market, graduates must work twice as hard\nto find meaningful employment. Academic excellence is not the be-all and end-\nall of a prospective hire\u2019s employability rating; employers want well-rounded\ncandidates whose skills extend to activities outside of the classroom\nenvironment. According to _[The Times Higher\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/postgraduate-degree-\nnecessary-get-job)_ ( _THE_ ), getting an undergraduate or a postgraduate\ndegree is important, but a candidate\u2019s personal skills and natural instincts\nare just as significant when it comes to getting hired.\n\nStephen Isherwood, Chief Executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters\nexplains that the best candidates usually have the right combination of\nsought-after knowledge, skills and attributes. \u201cThe best candidate usually\ngets the job as they have self-analysed, done their career research and met\nthe employer\u2019s needs,\u201d he says. \u201cThese truisms apply equally to undergraduates\nand postgraduates.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a statement that many recruitment specialists agree with, including Sam\nMiskin, talent acquisition manager at _Hearst Magazines_ , who adds that work\nexperience, commitment and having the right skills and attitude are also\nimportant factors considered by employers.\n\n![4l5a1468  ](/sites/default/files/uploads/4l5a1468.jpg)While it is true the\njob market is expected to improve in 2017, a\n_[CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/16/college-grads-enjoy-the-best-job-\nmarket-in-years.html) _report warns that graduates of 2016 will need to\ncompete with graduates from previous years who are currently unemployed, or\nworking low-wage jobs unrelated to their chosen field. Therefore, for\ngraduates to ace interviews and snag their dream careers, it\u2019s important that\nthey combine both academic and personal skills with the right work experience\nto ensure they snag that ultimate position.\n\nAt [Regent\u2019s University London](http://www.regents.ac.uk/), students are\nencouraged to pursue work experience opportunities, attend guest speaker\nlectures, and participate in networking events throughout their degree\nprogramme to help them get one step closer to their career aspirations.\n\n\u201cWhen our graduates leave, they are able to perform confidently anywhere in\nthe world. They go on to build successful international careers in a range of\nindustries, as well as becoming entrepreneurs, starting their own companies,\nor returning to ensure the continuing success of family businesses,\u201d says\nProfessor Aldwyn Cooper, Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive at Regent's\nUniversity London.\n\nJob hunting can be difficult, but equipped with the following skills, you\u2019ll\nfind yourself one up above the rest. Here are 5 work-ready attributes\nemployers love to see:\n\n**1\\. International perspective**\n\nStudying in a diverse and multicultural environment allows students to develop\na global network of friends and create a list of contacts upon graduation. And\nwith Regent\u2019s, you\u2019ll truly get to experience this, as the institution\nrepresents students from over 140 nationalities, creating a cosmopolitan\nenvironment of rich diversity. At Regent\u2019s internationalism is a way of life\nand programmes are international in both scope and relevance with many\nstudents spending a period of study abroad. Languages is also an integral part\nof a Regent\u2019s education, with students being encouraged to take classes in any\nof nine economically important languages to prepare them enter the world of\nwork and operate globally.\n\n**2\\. Industry/Relevant experience**\n\nEmployers are constantly looking for the right fit for their company, and this\nis something staff at Regent\u2019s understand. The institution is industry-focused\nand has access to the latest thinking and developments in the field through\ncontact with visiting experts and industry networking events. [MA Luxury Brand\nManagement](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-study/programmes/ma-\nluxury-brand-management/) regularly hosts luxury seminars to give students\naccess to the latest insights and developments in the industry. High profile\nspeakers in 2016 have included [Helen David, Harrods Fashion\nDirector](http://www.regents.ac.uk/news/internships-invaluable-harrods-\nfashion-director/), Matthew Zorpas from The Gentleman Blogger and Valerie\nKaminov, CEO of Miller Harris Perfumes to name a few.\n\nThe university also regularly organises seminars and debates with students\nwelcome to participate and share their thoughts on the impact of global\nevents. Additionally, students can seek guidance and advice from the\nuniversity\u2019s [career advisors](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-\nstudy/careers.aspx), who provide help with applications and cover letters, or\noffer welcome moral support. For some, [work\nplacements](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/careers/work-experience-and-\nplacements.aspx) are an integrated part of the programme, which are always\nhighly-valued by employers.\n\n**3\\. Strong communication skills**\n\nEffective communication skills are among the most cited industry requirements,\naccording to a _[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-job-\nskills-report/)_ report. The ability to speak to your lecturers and peers is a\nskill that you will master with Regents\u2019 world-class\n[programmes](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-study/programmes).\nYou will have the opportunity to work on live briefs, presentations and real-\nworld cases to balance academic knowledge with practical hands-on learning.\n\n**4\\. Leadership potential**\n\nAs Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, says, \u201cLeadership\nbelongs to those who take it\u201d. Leadership is one of the key traits that\nrecruitment managers look for in graduates, so take charge of a school project\nor volunteer to lead a new team as part of your extracurricular activities. If\nyour interest lies in leadership and management, the university offers a [BA\n(Hons) Global Management](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-\nstudy/programmes/ba-hons-global-management-leadership-management.aspx) degree\nwhere you can learn about proactive decision-making among other skills, to\nbecome a future business leader.\n\n![4l5a1468  regents_uni_feb_20160377\n](/sites/default/files/uploads/regents_uni_feb_20160377.jpg)At postgraduate\nlevel, Regent\u2019s offers an [MA\nManagement](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-study/programmes/ma-\nmanagement/) which takes a holistic approach to management and leadership\ntheory with a strong focus on developing your personal as well as professional\nattributes.\n\n**5\\. \u2018Go-getter\u2019 attitude**\n\nBesides getting good grades, it\u2019s important to get some extra-curriculars\nunder your belt to ensure your CV is well-rounded. Employers don\u2019t just look\nat qualifications and work experience to make a sound decision; they\u2019ll want\nto know if you\u2019re proactive, so show you are just that by joining the\nuniversity\u2019s campus-wide activities, clubs, societies, and social events.\n\nThe [Student Union](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/student-life/student-\nunion.aspx) organises various networking events, or you could get involved in\nmajor social/cultural events that run throughout the year, including the Grand\nAutumn Party, the Regent\u2019s Arts Festival, and more. But if that doesn\u2019t float\nyour boat, you can participate in the institution\u2019s competitive sports teams,\nwhich include football, basketball and polo, just to name a few. There are\nalso a range of other sports available, or you could even start your own\nunique club with the university\u2019s help. It doesn\u2019t stop there, once you\ngraduate you will be able to join the [Alumni Association better known as\nRegent\u2019s clubs](http://www.regents.ac.uk/about/alumni) and become part of a\nnetwork of more than 15,800 alumni in 158 countries.\n\nWith the support and guidance of a great university such as Regent\u2019s\nUniversity London, you\u2019ll be able to achieve your dream career goals. Located\nin the heart of the UK capital, the institution accepts direct applications\nall year-round with intakes in\n[January](http://www.regents.ac.uk/study/programmes-starting-january-2017/)\nand September.

Shortt](https://www.wnky.com/bios/josh-shortt/),\n\nGLASGOW, Ky.- Inside the walls of Barren County Middle School, and the\ndistrict\u2019s elementary schools like North Jackson, students are learning more\nabout being work ready.\n\nBring your Best, Barren is a work ethics program that involves taking on\nadditional roles to ensure that they're work ready. For three years, only high\nschool students could participate. Beginning in 2020, middle school eighth\ngraders and elementary school sixth graders can participate as well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so exciting, because by the time they get to the 12th grade, they\u2019ll\nunderstand the whole process of work ethics, and why we\u2019re doing this; to\nbetter them, and to get their profiles work ready,\u201d said Barren County School\nDistrict community education and after school coordinator Sonya Davis.\n\nDepending on what grade the student is in, this program will have them do\ndifferent tasks to teach them about responsibility and action, ranging from\noutside community service, to being responsible for everyone\u2019s pencils being\nsharpened, and even reaching out to fellow classmates.\n\n\u201cDuring recess, I go down to second grade and work with some kids. We just\nwork on homework, anything they need help with,\u201d said North Jackson Elementary\n6th grader Paul Lowe.\n\nThe teamwork activities the young students participate in are now related to\nthe new goal of getting the younger students ready. Something they can\u2019t wait\nto see the benefits of.\n\n\u201cI think it can really help everybody to get better jobs when they\u2019re older\nbecause we\u2019re learning at a younger age, so we know more stuff about it,\u201d said\nNorth Jackson Elementary sixth grader Lucy Zalla.\n\nStudents will also participate in interviews to apply for a work ethic\ncertificate, which they can use for future employment.\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.wnky.com/work-ready-program-expands-to-barren-county-middle-school-and-elementary-schools/)\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.wnky.com/work-ready-program-expands-to-barren-county-middle-school-and-elementary-schools/&text=Work%20ready%20program%20expands%20to%20Barren%20County%20Middle%20School%20and%20elementary%20schools%20)\n  * [email](mailto:?subject=Work%20ready%20program%20expands%20to%20Barren%20County%20Middle%20School%20and%20elementary%20schools&body=%20https://www.wnky.com/work-ready-program-expands-to-barren-county-middle-school-and-elementary-schools/)\n\n[Download the WNKY 40 News App](https://www.wnky.com/app/ \"WNKY 40 News App\")\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n[ ![Blessing For Workers Live Scott 040720](https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-\ncloud.net/www.wnky.com/content/uploads/2020/04/1586301683-4e09104dcffd449ee94604292c1cab9a864de3e1-1024x576.jpg)\n](https://www.wnky.com/scott-live-6pm-040720/)\n\n### [Faith community lifts up healthcare workers](https://www.wnky.com/scott-\nlive-6pm-040720/ \"Faith community lifts up healthcare workers\")\n\n[ ![Online Car Show](https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-\ncloud.net/www.wnky.com/content/uploads/2020/04/ONLINE-CAR-SHOW-1024x576.jpg)\n](https://www.wnky.com/national-corvette-museum-takes-auto-show-online/)\n\n### [National Corvette Museum takes auto show\nonline](https://www.wnky.com/national-corvette-museum-takes-auto-show-online/\n\"National Corvette Museum takes auto show online\")\n\n[ ![Sequence 01.00 00 19 08.still001](https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-\ncloud.net/www.wnky.com/content/uploads/2020/04/Sequence-01.00_00_19_08.Still001-1024x576.jpg)\n](https://www.wnky.com/farmers-seeing-corn-prices-drop-due-to-covid-19-and-\nforeign-affairs/)\n\n### [Farmers seeing corn prices drop due to COVID-19 and foreign\naffairs](https://www.wnky.com/farmers-seeing-corn-prices-drop-due-to-\ncovid-19-and-foreign-affairs/ \"Farmers seeing corn prices drop due to COVID-19\nand foreign affairs\")\n\n## Popular Articles\n\n### [J.C.

their\nprofessional careers, but the reality is [not always\nso](https://hbr.org/2019/04/the-biggest-hurdles-recent-graduates-face-\nentering-the-workforce). Some struggle to transition into a workforce for\nwhich they\u2019re ill-prepared and find themselves struggling to stay afloat.\n\nUniversities are under increasing pressure to produce work-ready graduates who\ncan step in as agile young professionals, ready to tackle the challenges\nahead. One way of doing this is by incorporating industry experience or\nquality work integrated learning (WIL) opportunities into the curriculum. WIL\nincludes experiences such as internships and fieldwork that improve students\u2019\nemployability.\n\nHands-on work experience serves as a platform from which students can put\ntheory into practice and learn the nuances of the working world, such as how\nperformance and feedback can be malleable, coming in the form of a passing\ncomment made by a manager instead of merely waiting to hear what\u2019s said at a\nperformance review much later on.\n\n![Professional-Writing-and-Publishing\n](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/Professional-Writing-and-Publishing.jpg)\n\nSource: Curtin University\n\n[Studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320284086_Work_integrated_learning_benefits_for_student_career_prospects_-\n_mixed_mode_analysis) already show that WIL can benefit students, exposing\nthem to the world of work. Many universities are integrating WIL to give their\nstudents a head start at professional success. Those looking to give\nthemselves the best preparation for the future workforce may want to consider\nthese four universities that offer industry experience in one form or another,\npreparing students for the future of work:\n\n### [**UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN QUEENSLAND (USQ) -\nAUSTRALIA**](https://www.usq.edu.au/)\n\nUSQ provides quality on-campus and online programs for students from over 100\ncountries and is ranked No. 1 in Australia for graduate starting salary ([Good\nUniversities Guide, ](https://www.usq.edu.au/news/2018/09/good-universities-\nguide-19)[2019](https://www.usq.edu.au/news/2018/09/good-universities-\nguide-19)).

By allowing the students and their instructor to\ncontrol multiple computers from one or more keyboards, video monitors, and\nmice, the Draco tera switch brings greater flexibility and new efficiencies to\nthe NHSTV broadcast operation.\n\n[![](https://www.sportsvideo.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IHSE-\nNWISD_Video_Control-300x124.jpg)](https://www.sportsvideo.org/new/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/IHSE-NWISD_Video_Control.jpg)Station NHSTV is part of\nthe school district's Creative Media Production (CMP) academy, giving students\nan immersive experience and complete introduction to the world of professional\nbroadcasting. In its 10th year at Northwest High School in suburban Fort\nWorth, the CMP academy focuses on television broadcast, filmmaking, graphic\ndesign and illustration, and commercial photography.\n\n\"With NHSTV, we're giving students tangible, real-world experience that will\ngive them an advantage for internships, acceptance to college programs, and\nemployment in any facility involved in audio and video production,\" said\n**Jeremy Rawe, coordinator of the CMP program**. \"The IHSE Draco tera switch\nhas helped us bring our facility into the 21st century and give our students a\nmore realistic work environment \u2014 one where they can use the equipment they're\nlikely to encounter in a real control room and a professional TV studio.\"\n\nNWISD worked with technology reseller Digital Resources to upgrade the NHSTV\nbroadcast facility, which had been operating for more than a decade with a\nvery basic technology configuration. The new installation quadruples the size\nof the control room and includes an all-Ross Video production environment\nincluding Ross routing switcher, playout server, graphics engine, and terminal\ngear. The 16-port Draco tera KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) switch ties together\nevery workstation and a separate rack room, giving the NHSTV crew the\nflexibility to manage all seven workstations from six different user locations\nin the studio.\n\n\"Our student producers can pop right into the KVM system directly from their\nown computers and make changes or perform tasks without having to get up and\nwalk over to the dedicated workstation. Fewer people moving around in the\ncontrol room isn't just a time saver, it also makes things safer and less\nchaotic when we're in the midst of a live production,\" Rawe said. \"Also, if a\nsituation arises with a server or technical function, I can take instant\ncontrol of any student's workstation right from my own desktop, and without\nhaving to leave my office. This helps me ensure the broadcasts are 100%\nstudent-run, while still allowing me to provide unobtrusive guidance and\nsupport.\"\n\n\"NHSTV is quite unique in high school education: a groundbreaking and award-\nwinning television studio and station operated completely by students,\"\ncomments **Dan Holland, marketing manager, IHSE USA**. \"We're honored to play\na role in NWISD's efforts to train and prepare the broadcasters of tomorrow,\ngiving students the skills and experience to be work-ready for professional\ncareers even before they graduate from high school.\"\n\n## Coronavirus Coverage\n\n[PGA TOUR, LPGA, Other Golf Associations Reschedule Major Events in\n2020](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/06/pga-tour-lpga-other-golf-\nassociations-reschedule-major-events-in-2020/)[Zixi Explains Findings from\nPoll on Media Industry's Readiness During Coronavirus\nPandemic](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/06/zixi-explains-findings-from-\npoll-on-media-industrys-readiness-during-coronavirus-pandemic/)[Sony Builds\n$100 Million Global Relief Fund to Combat\nCoronavirus](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/03/sony-builds-100-million-\nglobal-relief-fund-to-combat-coronavirus/)[Coronavirus Update: Wimbledon\nCanceled, UEFA Events Postponed Indefinitely, WTA and ATP Off Until\nJuly](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/01/coronavirus-update-wimbledon-\ncancelled-uefa-events-postponed-indefinitely-wta-and-atp-off-until-july/)[SVG\nSit-Down: BHV\u2019s Chris Bevilacqua on the Potential Impact of Coronavirus on\nSports-Media Rights Landscape](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/03/30/svg-sit-\ndown-bhvs-chris-bevilacqua-on-the-potential-impact-of-coronavirus-on-sports-\nmedia-right-landscape/)[InfoComm Cancels 2020 Show in Las Vegas Amid\nCoronavirus](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/03/30/infocomm-\ncancels-2020-show-in-las-vegas-amid-coronavirus/)[IATSE Responds to Passage of\n'CARES' Act in Congress](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/03/27/iatse-\nresponds-to-passage-of-cares-act-in-congress/)[Twitch To Host Stream Aid to\nRaise Donations for Coronavirus\nEfforts](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/03/27/twitch-to-host-stream-aid-to-\nraise-donations-for-coronavirus-efforts/)[Coronavirus Update 3/27: IndyCar\nMoves Indianapolis 500 from May 24 to Aug. 23;

However, if certain students studying\ncertain courses at particular universities are reaping comparatively greater\nbenefits when they leave, there must be another way to equip graduates to\ncompete in the world of work.\n\n**The skills factor**\n\nIncreasing pressure on organisations and businesses to perform, compete and\nrespond to rapidly changing economic demands means there is no longer the\nspace for entry level graduates to orientate at a leisurely pace. Employers\nneed graduates to contribute value sooner than ever before.\n\nTherefore, employers have an expectation that college curricula will be\nrelevant to their needs. Some colleges can offer this through the strength of\nacademic staff\u2019s connections with industry. However, most universities\nmaintain a traditional focus on research and high-quality academic teaching\nrather than developing 'work-ready' graduates.\n\nStudent and business expectations, plus pressure on university budgets, the\nneed for alternative sources of revenue and Government funding becoming more\ndependent on delivering outcomes has led to colleges looking for other\noptions.\n\n\n\nAlready, some universities are now seeing the value of incorporating\nprofessional certifications for their students alongside established courses.\n\n**Professional certifications in action**\n\nIn practice, what does obtaining a professional certification mean to a\nstudent in further or higher education? First, it provides a common language\nand set of skills that could already be familiar to existing employees in an\norganisation and helps to start developing a professional approach to work.\n\nOften, professional courses have been devised with input from experienced\npeople working in a particular field and this offers valuable knowledge and\ntools to enable new entrants to work more effectively and collaboratively in\ntheir workplace.\n\nWith an increasing emphasis on using 'high velocity' methods in organisations\n\u2013 such as Agile \u2013 and adopting new technologies that optimise performance and\nenable organisations to respond more promptly to customer expectations, the\nrelevant skills are often available only through specialist training courses\nand certifications.\n\nThe opportunity for students to enhance a CV and demonstrate relevant work\nskills at the point of applying for jobs means universities are starting to\nrecognise the value of adding professional certifications to their core\nacademic curricula.\n\nThe value of this for student employability is now being acknowledged both by\ncourse lecturers and people working in college careers services or centres for\ncontinuing education.\n\n* * *\n\n[Get the best L&D content every\nThursday](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/5EDB0B405AAF8D30)\n\n* * *\n\nUniversities, as educational establishments which are already delivering a\nhigh quality of learning, can choose to become training organisations for the\npurpose of delivering professional training and certification. Alternatively,\nthere are numerous accredited training organisations that can step into the\nrole and allow undergraduates to learn and certify as part of their course, or\nin addition to it.\n\n**Developing the university of the future**\n\nThe fast-changing economic environment in the UK \u2013 and, indeed, worldwide \u2013\nmeans universities need to do everything possible to prepare their students\nfor the world of work and equip them with skills and capabilities beyond what\nthey learn on traditional degree courses.\n\nIncluding professional certifications in university curricula means embedding\ntried and tested approaches that are already adopted by organisations to\nsupport employees\u2019 workplace development.\n\nAlong with technical knowledge, that includes cultivating soft skills such as\ncommunication, problem solving and negotiation as part of the foundation for\ntheir future working lives.\n\n\n\n**About the author**\n\nMark Hudson is academia manager at [AXELOS ](http://www.axelos.com)\n\n\n\nTags\n\n[Assessment](/tags/assessment)\n\n[CPD](/tags/cpd)\n\n[Facilitation](/tags/facilitation)\n\n[Hard skills](/tags/hard-skills)\n\nCategories\n\n[Business and industry](/categories/business-and-industry)\n\n[Education and skills](/categories/education-and-skills)\n\n### Share this page\n\n[![Printer-friendly\nversion](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/all/modules/print/icons/print_icon.png)Printer-\nfriendly version](https://www.trainingjournal.com/print/6758 \"Display a\nprinter-friendly version of this page.\")\n\n### CONTRIBUTIONS FROM READERS\n\nPlease [login](/user/login) to post a comment or [register for a free\naccount](/user/register).\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[![Close up hand arranging wood block stacking as step stair on paper blue and\npink\nbackground](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/www.trainingjournal.com/files/styles/original_-\n_local_copy/entityshare/34547%3Fitok%3D4MNOAToa)](/articles/features/development-\ndone-right-when-everything-around-you-changing)\n\n[Development done right (when everything around you is\nchanging)](/articles/features/development-done-right-when-everything-around-\nyou-changing)\n\n31 March 2020\n\nHowever fast things are changing, you still need to build the skills of your\nworkforce, says Jack Allen.\n\n[![Funny Mask groucho marx\nstyle](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/www.trainingjournal.com/files/styles/original_-\n_local_copy/entityshare/34540%3Fitok%3DkYiaTyi9)](/articles/features/dealing-\nimposter-syndrome-workplace)\n\n[Dealing with imposter syndrome in the workplace](/articles/features/dealing-\nimposter-syndrome-workplace)\n\n31 March 2020\n\nMost of us will feel it at some point in our lives.

Learning for the sake of learning\nshould be valued.\n\nBut as some frugal governments have sought to reduce public funding for higher\neducation institutions they\u2019ve asked what is a fair question: do universities\nproduce graduates ready for the workplace?\n\nIn Australia at least, it would seem they do. According to the [2017 Employer\nSatisfaction Survey](https://www.qilt.edu.au/docs/default-\nsource/ess/ess-2017/ess_2017_national_report_final.pdf?sfvrsn=19b2e33c_6)\n(ESS) released this week by the country\u2019s Department of Education, 84 percent\nof graduates\u2019 direct supervisors reporting to be satisfied with their\nemployees.\n\n> New report: Across Australia, the overall satisfaction with graduates as\n> rated by their direct supervisors was 84%.

Employability was ranked lowest at 85\npercent overall.\n\n\u201cThese results tell an overwhelmingly positive story about graduates in the\nlabour market and that universities are preparing their students well for\ntheir chosen careers,\u201d said [Universities\nAustralia](https://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/Media-and-Events/media-\nreleases/Grads-well-prepared-for-jobs--employer-satisfaction-remains-high--\nsurvey#.WlSh-aiWbIV)'s Acting Chief Executive Catriona Jackson.\n\n\u201cEmployers have given university graduates the equivalent of a high\ndistinction,\u201d she added. Satisfaction with all graduate attributes improved\nbetween 2016 and 2017.\n\nInterestingly, the report noted that \u201cgraduates tended to view their\nqualification as less important for their current employment than did their\nsupervisors.\u201d Nevertheless, only 11 percent of graduates felt that their\neducation was \u201cnot at all important\u201d.\n\nIn terms of institutions, Australia\u2019s so-called \u201csandstone universities\u201d were\nedged out by their younger and less famous competitors in terms of meeting the\nexpectations of employers.\n\nRespondents reported the highest rates of overall satisfaction with graduates\nfrom [James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/) (90.6 percent), [The\nUniversity of Notre Dame Australia](http://www.nd.edu.au/) (89.1 percent), the\n[University of the Sunshine Coast](https://www.usc.edu.au/) (88.8 percent),\n[Bond University](https://bond.edu.au/intl) (88.6 percent) and the [University\nof Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/index.html) (88.1 percent) snagging the\ntop five spots.\n\n> Australian employers rate La Trobe University graduates in the 2017 Employer\n> Satisfaction Survey:\n> [@latrobe](https://twitter.com/latrobe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) graduates ranked\n> 2nd among Victorian universities and 8th nationally for overall\n> satisfaction! <https://t.co/gvzy7J0W2m>\n> [pic.twitter.com/KFuLATYPHZ](https://t.co/KFuLATYPHZ)\n>\n> -- La Trobe Melbourne (@StudyatLTM) [January 8,\n> 2018](https://twitter.com/StudyatLTM/status/950490819277946881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nOther high performers were the [University of\nQueensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) (87.6 percent), [RMIT\nUniversity](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) (87.3 percent), [La Trobe\nUniversity](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/) (86.6 percent), the [University of\nMelbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/) (86.1 percent) and [Western Sydney\nUniversity](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/) (85.8 percent).\n\nThe report notes, however, that employer satisfaction is \u201cconsistently high\u201d\nacross all of Australia\u2019s universities, ranging between 91 percent to 77\npercent.\n\nEmployers also indicated they were more satisfied with female graduates than\nmale ones, at 84.5 percent versus 82.3 percent.

your job before you even graduate?\n\nNovember 5, 2019\n\n[![Liz Hilton

Lund](/author/susan-\nlund/)\n\nWith each passing year, parents are getting more worried about how their\nchildren will fare once it\u2019s time to take that step from school to the\nworkforce.\n\nThey have good reason to fret. Some 17 million Americans under age 30\u2014[about\none third](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/13/facts-about-\nstudent-loans/) of the under-30 population\u2014are saddled with student debt. Many\nare worried about their career prospects despite having invested\u2014heavily, in\nsome cases\u2014in education.\n\nThe [cost of college](https://qz.com/1707593/were-thinking-about-the-student-\ndebt-crisis-all-wrong/) is being hotly debated. But it\u2019s only one aspect of an\neven bigger issue: The automation of many entry-level roles will make it even\nharder for young people to gain traction in the working world.\n\nThe road from education to employment is full of more disconnects than ever.\n[Research](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-\nfuture-of-work-in-america-people-and-places-today-and-tomorrow) from the\nMcKinsey Global Institute finds that workers from ages 18 to 34 hold almost\n40%\u2014or 14.7 million\u2014of the US jobs that could disappear due to automation in\nthe next decade. This creates a challenge for young people, both for those\ntrying to make a living in the service sector and for college graduates aiming\nto get onto the professional track.\n\nWorkers aged 18 to 34 hold almost 40%\u2014or 14.7 million\u2014of the US jobs that\ncould disappear due to automation in the next decade.\n\nTwo-thirds of the job losses for young people could occur in food,\nhospitality, or retail. These industries provide a crucial opportunity for\nmore than 30 million Americans overall to bring home a paycheck\u2014and workers\nunder 34 years old make up half or more of the nation\u2019s wait staff, hotel\nreceptionists, and fast food workers. These types of roles build valuable soft\nskills like communication, punctuality, and customer service, and they also\nprovide that all-important first line on a resume that can propel people\nonward and upward. The gig economy has created some alternative options such\nas driving and delivery, but those types of on-demand services are scarce\noutside of urban areas.\n\nOne-third of the automation-related job losses for young people could occur in\nwhite-collar jobs, including entry-level roles in accounting, finance, human\nresources, and administration. In the legal profession, for example, AI can\nhandle document review and case law search\u2014not a favorite task for junior\nattorneys, perhaps, but one that provides valuable immersion and learning.\nActuaries have traditionally spent their early years crunching numbers to\nassess risk. Now AI is outperforming humans at these tasks.\n\nThis means aspiring young professionals will need to enter the labor force in\nhigher-level roles. But employers have been saying for years that too many new\nhires, even those with college degrees, are not work-ready.\n\nThe jobs of the future will demand even more in the way of digital skills,\npeople skills, creativity, communication, and critical thinking.\n\nCompanies can help to address this issue by offering more paid internships and\napprenticeships to prepare students to hit the ground running after\ngraduation. The apprenticeship model, traditionally associated with skilled\ntrades, is now being adopted by companies such as IBM, Bank of America, and\ninvestment and insurance firm The Hartford.\n\nAs technology changes, we need to change apace. The US education system has\nnot evolved as quickly as the new world of work. It is not equipping students\nenough of the technical skills nor the soft skills they will need in the\nworkforce. And there are few road maps available for the majority of young\npeople who are not headed to college.\n\n## Back to high school\n\nA systematic solution could be to expand student access to a wider range of\npost-secondary education and training programs, or blended schools that\ncombine high school diplomas with associates degrees.\n\nWhen technology took a leap forward in the early 1900s, shifting the economy\nfrom agriculture to manufacturing, the United States responded by making high\nschool universal and compulsory.\n\nThe \u201chigh school movement\u201d eventually made Americans the best-educated\nworkforce in the world and set the stage for the GI Bill to boost college\nattendance after World War II. The wave of technological progress we\u2019re facing\ntoday calls for a similar raising of the bar for how the young generation\nattains education.\n\nIn nearly every field, workers will increasingly need access to some type of\npostsecondary training. In addition to expanding access to four-year\nuniversities, we need a wider variety of options, including community college,\napprenticeships, online courses, vocational schools, and credential programs.\n\nSome initiatives promise progress in this direction. In 2014, Tennessee became\nthe first state to cover the cost of community college or technical training\nfor residents\u2014and since then, more than a dozen states and some cities, like\nChicago, have followed suit. Some of these programs, such as IBM\u2019s P-Tech\nschools, the Dallas County Promise, and the Detroit Promise Path, provide\nbusiness mentors to help young people through the job application process and\nacademic life.\n\nThis can be critical support for participants who are the first in their\nfamilies to go beyond high school. Early\n[evidence](https://www.wsac.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2014.ptw.\\(31\\).pdf)\nsuggests these programs have increased the share of young people attending and\ncompleting community college.\n\nEmployers have the best view on emerging jobs and the new sets of skills\nrequired. Some are working closely with community colleges, online educators,\nand universities to design relevant curricula to create a more robust talent\npipeline. Advanced manufacturing companies in particular have made an effort\nto get out in front with community college partnerships to develop the\nspecialized skills they need to fill the thousands of open positions in the US\nmanufacturing market.\n\nNorthrop Grumman has worked with the University of Maryland to create a\n[certificate in cybersecurity](https://research.umd.edu/ng), a growing field\nwith too few graduates. Others are participating in efforts to standardize\ncredentials. Google has worked with Coursera, an online education provider, to\ncreate a [five-course certificate](https://grow.google/programs/it-support/)\nto prepare workers for IT support positions. That certificate is now\nrecognized by dozens of major employers across the US.\n\nThese are all positive steps. But now these efforts need to be scaled up. The\nUnited States needs to focus on upgrading its workforce skills\u2014and we\ndefinitely can\u2019t afford to let the disappearance of entry-level jobs leave\nmillions of young people adrift.\n\n[![Quartz Daily Brief](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n[\n\n##### Quartz Daily Brief\n\n](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n##### Subscribe to the Daily Brief, our morning email with news and insights\nyou need to understand our changing world.\n\nSign me up\n\n[Ideas](/re/ideas/), [artificial intelligence](/re/artificial-intelligence/),\n[AI](/re/ai/), [automation](/re/automation/), [robot](/re/robot/)\n\n[\ud83d\udcac\\+ Add your insights](/co/2803600/)\n\n[](mailto:?subject=Quartz%3A%20Will%20robots%20take%20your%20job%20before%20you%20even%20graduate%3F&body=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1741871%2Frobots-\nare-already-outperforming-humans-at-entry-level-\ntasks%2F%0A%0AAI%20will%20soon%20outperform%20humans%20at%20entry-\nlevel%20tasks%2C%20but%20schools%20aren't%20equipping%20students%20with%20the%20skills%20they%20need%20to%20keep%20up.%0A%0ASign%20up%20for%20the%20Quartz%20Daily%20Brief%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Fdaily-\nbrief \"Share via\nemail\")[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1741871%2Frobots-\nare-already-outperforming-humans-at-entry-level-\ntasks%2F&caption=qz.com%20%7C%20By%20Liz%20Hilton%20Segel \"Share via\nfacebook\")[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1741871%2F&text=Will%20robots%20take%20your%20job%20before%20you%20even%20graduate%3F&via=qz\n\"Share via twitter\")\n\n[](/)\n\nNews for the next era, not the next hour\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\nDiscover\n\n  * [Membership](/become-a-member/)\n  * [Emails](/emails/)\n  * [Latest](/latest/)\n  * [Popular](/popular/)\n  * [Featured](/featured/)\n  * [Obsessions](/obsessions/)\n\nTopics\n\n  * [Emerging industries](/topic/emerging-industries/)\n  * [Economics](/topic/finance-and-economics/)\n  * [Lifestyle](/topic/lifestyle/)\n  * [Politics](/topic/politics-and-policy/)\n  * [Science](/topic/science-and-human-behavior/)\n  * [Tech](/topic/tech-and-communications/)\n  * [Work](/topic/work-and-management/)\n\nMore\n\n  * [Search](/search/)\n  * [Careers](/careers/)\n  * [About us](/about/)\n  * [Contact us](/about/#contact)\n  * [Help center](https://help.qz.com/en/)\n  * [Send us tips](/tips/)\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\n[Download our app](/app/?pid=socialshare&af_dp=zebroid%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ffooter)\n\n  * [Site map](/sitemap/)\n  * [Terms & conditions](/about/terms-conditions/)\n  * [Privacy policy](/about/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Do not sell my info](/about/do-not-sell/)\n  * [Ethics and advertising agreements](/about/ethicsandadvertisingguidelines/)\n  * [Community agreements](/about/community-agreements/)\n\nQuartz is owned by [Uzabase](https://www.uzabase.com/en/), the business\nintelligence and media company. \u00a9 2020 Quartz Media, Inc.

training the future of learning and development?\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few advantages of web-based training (WBT).\n\n![Is web-based training the future of learning and\ndevelopment?](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1567167428/1567167426.jpg)\n\nWeb-based training has replaced instructor-led training in many organizations\nand for a good reason. The availability and ease of creating online training\nhave fuelled this choice of learning and development across various learners\nand training professionals. However, the proverbial question remains; will\nweb-based training replace instructor-led training entirely in the future?\nLet\u2019s look at a few advantages of web-based training (WBT):\n\n### Mobile learning\n\nLearning centricity is at the core of WBT\u2019s. There is no dearth of free and\npaid online courses and learners are opting for any-time learning via LinkedIn\nLearning, Coursera, EdEx, Lynda; just a few names that have revolutionized the\nlearning space. Moreover, most online training courses can be accessed through\nlaptops and cell phones. Most learners are hard-pressed for time, and this\nease of accessing learning content on their commute to work or on weekends\nattracts them to WBT\u2019s.\n\n### Self-paced learning\n\nThe second advantage of WBT\u2019s is that they are self- paced, unlike instructor-\nled training, which is provided by instructors in a training room for a few\nhours/days at max. The learner has the onus of remembering and understanding\neverything he can in the few hours spent in training. How many of us go back\nto the trainer after the training to clear their doubts? Very few, I believe.\nWith WBT\u2019s the learner can go back and access the training material any number\nof times even when the training is over.\n\n### Multi-location access\n\nMost organizations do not operate from a single working location now. With\norganizations increasingly going global and having remote workers in various\nplaces, web-based training has become a way of connecting learners across\nbranches and countries. In addition to that, WBT\u2019s are also less expensive as\ncompared to instructor-led training (ILT). Imagine the cost an organization\nwould have to incur to fly an instructor to various branches/countries or to\ntrain faculty in multiple locations versus creating an interactive online\ncourse.\n\n### Shortcomings of WBT\n\nHaving said that the main shortcoming of WBT\u2019s is the lack of human\ninteraction or involvement. In classroom training participants get the\nopportunity to learn along with meaningful discussions, there is also a\nhealthy competitive spirit that is seen among the participants, which seem to\nbe lacking in WBT\u2019s.\n\nIs there a solution to this? I say, yes! The answer is virtual instructor-led\ntraining (VILT). This mode provides the best of both worlds. Learners log in\nusing a webex or a video conference and become a part of an interactive and\nreal-time learning session.\n\n### WBT, ILT or VILT: Which one to choose?\n\nWhether an organization is going to use WBT/ILT/VILT should be decided on a\nfew key parameters \u2013the number of people who will be attending the session, if\nthe number is huge and the reach expected is wide, then ILT may not be\nfeasible. In that case, VILT or WBT can be used. Next, the type of training\nthat needs to be delivered is also a critical consideration; if the content is\nrepetitive or coding based WBT\u2019s are the answer. However, learners will need\nmore participative learning in sessions like leadership and listening skills.\nDemographic factors like age also become an important area of consideration;\nmillennials prefer WBT\u2019s, but the older generation may not be too comfortable\nwith accessing online training.\n\nThe learning space is changing at breakneck speed with the advent of online\ntraining, simulations, and that means that the learning modes and content are\nin abundance. Organizations need to carefully analyze the training needs of\ntheir employees and their learning objectives to decide which mode will be\nbest suited to them. However, there is no doubt that the world is moving\ntowards a web-based training paradigm and embracing the mobile, self-paced,\nand cost-effective mode of learning.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning & Development](/category/compensation-\nperformance/training-development?utm_source=post_blog&utm_content=training-\ndevelopment \"Browse more in: Learning &amp; Development\"),\n[#GuestArticle](/tag/guest-article?utm_source=post_blog&utm_content=guest-\narticle \"Browse more in: GuestArticle\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Parul Bahl](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1501218161/authors/parul-\nbedi.jpg)](/author/parul-bedi)\n\n#### [Parul Bahl](/author/parul-bedi)\n\nParul Bahl is an Assistant Manager - HR (Generalist) at Tata Consultancy\nServices.

Under TFI\u2019s leadership, an industry working group comprised of Bank\nof Montreal, CIBC, OMERS, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Sun Life, TD Bank\nGroup, and TMX Group was formed to collaborate extensively with Seneca to\ndevelop the program\u2019s curriculum.\n\n\u201cWith Seneca\u2019s expertise in cybersecurity and financial services, working with\nTFI is a natural and ideal partnership,\u201d said Ranjan Bhattacharya, Dean,\nFaculty of Applied Science & Engineering Technology. \u201cThe new program is a\ngreat example of the industry-relevant credentials that Seneca is known for.\nWe look forward to helping individuals prepare for and transition to careers\nin this exciting and in-demand sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cCybersecurity is increasingly at the top of the agenda for organizations\nacross the country that are being affected by technological evolution and the\nresulting need to constantly improve their cybersecurity capabilities,\u201d said\nJennifer Reynolds, President and CEO, Toronto Finance International. \u201cA pool\nof skilled talent is critical to mitigating business disruption caused by\nthese evolving threats. That is why Seneca and TFI are partnering with\nindustry leaders within Financial Services to deliver a tailored educational\nprogram that will help accelerate the delivery of a skilled pool of\ncybersecurity talent.\n\nSeneca\u2019s School of Information and Communications Technology and the School of\nAccounting and Financial Services partnered to develop the eight-month\nprogram, which will prepare students for careers in the information technology\nand financial services sectors \u2014 areas critical to local and global\ninnovation.

Burton creates signature scent for consumers to take home\")\n\n**British jewellery brand Olivia Burton has created a signature scent to add\nto its offer.**\n\nWhen the watch and jewellery brand was bought by the Movado Group in 2017, the\nCEO hinted that he had plans to make Olivia Burton a full lifestyle brand.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, Olivia Burton is the only brand out there that is truly\ndifferent,\u201d said Movado Group's CEO at the time of acquiring the brand. \u201cIt\nhas a true DNA and a true identity that is expandable into a lifestyle brand.\nIt is almost a collectible, which makes it really special.\u201d\n\nStory continues below\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the brand has opened its debut bricks and mortar boutique, which\nhas resulted in a lift in jewellery sales, and small lifestyle gifts (such as\nmirrors) have been well received by the company's loyal following.\n\nNow Olivia Burton has introduced a \u201csignature scent\u201d for homes that will leave\nconsumer's living rooms smelling like a British country garden.\n\nThe brand says of the scent, \"a floral heart of rose, jasmine and peony,\nunfolds like a bouquet of freshly cut flowers\u201d.\n\nThe Floral Home Fragrance is on sale in stores and online now for \u00a332.\n\nThe brand has also introduced a scarf tie gift set for ladies and a pocket\nsquare gift set for me.\n\nTags : [Movado Group](https://www.professionaljeweller.com/tag/movado-group/\n\"Movado Group\")[Olivia\nBurton](https://www.professionaljeweller.com/tag/olivia-burton/ \"Olivia\nBurton\")\n\n__

That's because the latest professional graphics\nprocessors (GPUs) from Nvidia are finally coming to notebooks.\n\nThese new [mobile workstations](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-mobile-\nworkstations) \u2013 some of which are consumer laptops freshly outfitted with this\nwork-ready gear\u2013 will include Nvidia's Quadro RTX GPUs built on the [Turing\narchitecture](https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing).\n\nMany of the laptops that will come out with this high-end hardware will have\nall the horsepower of even the [best gaming\nlaptops](https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-gaming-\nlaptops-top-5-gaming-notebooks-reviewed-1258471), and then some. Many will\nboast the latest Intel Core i9 processors (CPUs), for incredibly strong\nprocessing power to go alongside the solid graphical power.\n\nWhile several of Nvidia's Quadro GPUs will appear in the new mobile\nworkstations, the powerful Quadro RTX 5000 seems to be chief among them. This\nGPU will power many of the new laptops under Nvidia's RTX Studio moniker.\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n![The Acer ConceptD 7 with Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 inside. \\(Image Credit:\nAcer\\)](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nThe Acer ConceptD 7 with Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 inside.

The SAP Young Professional Program is organised by SAP in partnership\nwith the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH\nand hosted by Deloitte. The graduation ceremony was held in Lagos and was\nattended by Mr Hakeem Fahm, the Commissioner for Science and Technology, who\nrepresented Lagos State Government.\n\nDuring his address, Mr Fahm said: \u201cTrue transformation is only possible when\nthere is a shift in mindset from the ordinary to the outstanding as exhibited\nby SAP with its efforts at putting an end to digital skills shortage which\naffects the growth and innovation potential of even the most successful global\norganisations.  Around this time last year, we were all gathered here to\ncelebrate the first crop of graduates of this program, who have since then\nsupported organisations to thrive in the Digital Era thanks to the knowledge\nand skills acquired from the program. The intensity at which the SAP work-\nready digital skills agenda is impacting lives is a testament to the fact that\nwith proper grooming, African youth can indeed play active roles in the much-\nanticipated digital skills and technologies -dominated future economy.\u201d\n\n## Great urgency to upskill Africa\u2019s youth\n\nThe SAP Young Professional Program, an initiative offered under the umbrella\nof SAP Skills for Africa, has since its launch in 2012 trained and graduated\nmore than 990 youths across Africa and more than 2550 talents globally.\n\nAccording to Cathy Smith, Managing Director at SAP Africa, there is great\nurgency in equipping more African youth with digital skills, as more than 40\nmillion high-skilled workers will be needed globally by 2020\\. \u201cConsidering\nthat youth account for 60% of Africa\u2019s unemployed, and that the continent has\nthe largest and fastest-growing youth population in the world, it is\nimperative that we equip our young talent with the skills they need to be\nactive participants in the global economy,\u201d said Smith.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming response, so far, has further fuelled our organisation\u2019s\ncommitment to continue training programs that will help empower the local\ncommunities by closing the digital skills gap; providing businesses with the\nright support system; and powering economic expansion,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe thank\nour customers and partners including Deloitte, Eta-Zuma Group, Oryx Systems\nLimited, SHELL Nigeria and WYZE Consulting, that hired our recent program\ngraduates of the SAP Young Professional Program in Nigeria and hereby join our\nefforts to enable today\u2019s youth for the Digital Era.\u201d  \n\n## Career kick-start for young professionals\n\nGraduates that form part of the Young Professional Program undergo a rigorous\nselection process before embarking on the three-month full-time training\nprogram where they are equipped with SAP and soft skills needed to succeed in\nthe modern workplace. This makes every graduate of the program immediately\nemployable in a range of public and private sector companies. Through SAP\u2019s\nclose partnership with its customers and industry partners, over 99% of all\nprogram graduates secure work placement upon graduation.\n\nOne of the graduates from the inaugural program in 2018, who is now employed\nat WYZE Consulting as SAP Presales and Delivery Consultant, Adedoyin Akande,\nsaid: \u201cDefinitely, the Young Professional Program was the major start of my\ncareer and the training equipped me with so much competence to help me\nkickstart my career.\u201d\n\nThis cohort of the SAP Young Professional Program in Nigeria is part of a\nrecently announced collaboration between SAP and the German Federal Ministry\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) with the aim to jointly create\n450 jobs for highly qualified personnel in the IT sector in ten African\ncountries over the course of three years. The cooperation project is part of\nthe special initiative \u201eTraining and Job Creation\u201c and the develoPPP for jobs\nprogram that the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)\nGmbH implements on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic\nCooperation and Development (BMZ).\n\n## New academic partnership promises work-ready innovators\n\nThe SAP Young Professional Program is one of two programs under the umbrella\nof SAP Skills for Africa; the other being the SAP Dual Study Program, designed\nto provide university students with training and certifications linked to\nSAP\u2019s latest innovations that align to the company\u2019s Intelligent Enterprise\nmodel.\n\nBuilding on its previous efforts on digital skills build and youth enablement\nin Nigeria and beyond, SAP recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with\nCovenant University in Nigeria for the Dual Study Program, extending the\nprogram\u2019s reach to 24 universities across 13 countries globally.\n\nMarita Mitschein, Senior Vice President of Digital Skills Southern Europe,\nMiddle East & Africa at SAP and Managing Director of the SAP Training and\nDevelopment Institute, said: \u201cIn partnership with leading universities, the\n6-12 months program combines university theoretical studies with the\nopportunity for students to take SAP certification during academic years under\nthe collaborative curriculum. This helps bridge the gap between university and\nworkplace by giving students a competitive edge. With a pervasive digital\nskills shortage affecting the growth and innovation potential of even the most\nsuccessful global organisations, both the SAP Young Professional Program as\nwell as the SAP Dual Study Program provide organisations with ready-to-employ\ntech talent with scarce digital skills on market-leading SAP technologies.\u201d\n\nDr Ada, Assistant Professor and Director International Officer and Linkages at\nCovenant University, said: \u201cThe Dual Study Program is a great opportunity for\nour students to build the right skillset required by the labor market before\nthey graduate, which allows them to kickstart their career immediately after\ngraduation. By joining hands with the market leader in enterprise application\nsoftware we can empower our young people who will shape the future of our\ncountry and our continent.\u201d\n\nAs the Experience Company powered by the Intelligent Enterprise, SAP is the\nmarket leader in enterprise application software, helping companies of all\nsizes and in all industries run at their best: 77% of the world\u2019s transaction\nrevenue touches an SAP\u00ae system.

Davis](/author/ellie-davis \"Ellie Davis\")\n  * Thursday 15 August 2019 16:45\n\nClick to follow  \nThe Evening Standard\n\nWhen our alarm sounds that it\u2019s time to leave our cloud-like cocoon of a bed\nand head to the office, we are faced with the first challenge of the day \u2013\nfinding something to wear.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like us, this is a daily struggle that preoccupies far more\ntime in the morning than we care to admit. But there is a simple way to\nmaximise your sleep by creating an army of work-ready dresses.\n\nWorkwear has seen a major evolution over the past ten or so years where the\ndefinition of office appropriate has loosened since monochromatic suiting\ndominated the board room.\n\nWhen it comes to navigating the tricky politics of the workplace wardrobe\nself-assurance is key. You need something professional but you still need to\nbe comfortable, and you don\u2019t want to spend all day tugging at your hemline or\nworrying about accidental flashes. You also need to feel confident in what you\nare wearing.\n\nIdeally the piece will also be transitional \u2013 worn from summer to winter \u2013 and\nwill take you from your 9 to 5 to your evening plans with ease.\n\nWhile we are not opposed to the versatility of blouses and trousers, the\nbeauty of the work dress means you only have to worry about one thing. By\ncreating an arsenal of failsafe dresses with an effortless throw-on-and-go\nquality, you will banish your morning sartorial struggle without adding to\nyour floordrobe of rejected ensembles.\n\n## _**_Best Dresses for Work_**_\n\n### **Bow Wrap Dress**\n\nA wrap dress presents ample styling possibilities, and we think this latest\naddition from Mango deserves to be played on office-repeat.\n\nSee all **_[NEW dresses from\nMango](https://shop.mango.com/gb/women/dresses_c55363448)_**\n\n### **ME + EM Striped Rib Midi Dress**\n\nNew to the collection but somehow we're already nostalgic about it \u2014 fun,\nprofessional and a bit unexpected, this might just be office dress of the\nyear.\n\n### **Utility Shirt Dress**\n\nThis one is a no-brainer, simple, chic and classic black.

education](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/dreamstime_s_70351698-696x464.jpg)](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/dreamstime_s_70351698.jpg)\n\n## Alison Watson, Programme Leader for BA (Hons) Business at Arden University\nshares her views on how the higher education sector is helping to prepare\nstudents to be work-ready\n\nThere is great pressure on both organisations and higher education\ninstitutions to develop skilled workers. As many sectors face a skills gap,\nemployers are struggling to recruit the right talent, [while traditional\nstudents graduate with big debts and limited work\nexperience](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/the-decrease-in-adult-\nlearning-are-we-clued-up-on-funding/48260/). It is necessary for this gap\nbetween employee shortages and lack of experience to be filled. Higher\neducational institutions see this issue and attempt to resolve this through\ntheir curriculum development and embedding soft skills into degree programmes.\nThe following provides an overview of how universities are attempting to\nrectify this issue.\n\nThe higher education sector is becoming increasingly aware of the demand from\nemployers for the development of required sector skills when designing\nundergraduate and postgraduate programmes.\n\nToday, employers are not only looking for graduates to be equipped with the\nknowledge in their specialised fields but also to possess fundamental\ntransferrable skills to enable them to operate effectively within an\norganisation, for example, communication, negotiation and time management\nskills.\n\nIn order for employees to function effectively, they need to be able to\ndemonstrate they have these hidden skills and are able to put them into\npractice. More programmes are being designed with these skills in mind and are\nembedded through teaching and learning strategies. Caution must be drawn,\nhowever, to providing graduates with a balanced competence set. Focusing too\nmuch on these skills could lead to more practical ones being ignored.\n\n[A lot of universities are committed to providing society with work-ready\nindividuals. ](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/bringing-the-world-of-\nwork-to-life-for-young-people/43457/)A part of this process is to support,\ndevelop and prepare students for the working environment, for the benefit of\nemployees and employers alike.\n\nThe main driver for students when enrolling in university courses is career\nenhancement and to get a good job. With this motivation in mind, universities\nprovide students with numerous support mechanisms to help them prepare for\nlife after study. Not only do they equip graduates with the skills necessary\nto function in their sector, but also coach and mentor students to support\nthem in their job search with guidance on writing a CV, interview advice and\ntime management tips.\n\nMany universities provide students with access to alumni, whereby students can\nactively network with peers to gain contacts in the world of work. Careers\nadvice services are also often at hand to provide guidance to students and\nwork placement opportunities.\n\nA number of universities have identified a priority to work with employers and\nprofessional, statutory and regulatory bodies to develop programmes suitable\nfor students to complete, in order for them to support their career\ndevelopment.\n\nMarketisation is forcing change within the academic environment. Today, there\nappears to be a decline in learning for its own sake and, as an alternative,\nhigher educational institutions are opting to introduce more vocational\ncourses focusing on teaching skills that can be transferred to the working\nenvironment. Presenting students with real-life problems will help them to\ndevelop the necessary experience.\n\nWorking with a range of stakeholders, including businesses, enables higher\neducation institutions to identify the most sought-after skills. This\ncollaborative approach supports the commitment to transform students into job-\nready individuals who are able to quickly adjust to the business environment.\n\nThe increasing accessibility and development of higher apprenticeships are\nalso contributing positively to this combined effort between stakeholders to\ndevelop students\u2019 potential.\n\nIt is, therefore, essential for higher education institutions to continue to\nbuild relationships with a range of external stakeholders who can influence\nthe development of their courses. Equipping graduates with the practical\nskills to be ready to enter into the work environment is essential for our\neconomy and society.\n\nAlison Watson is Programme Leader for BA Business at Arden University. She is\nan expert in marketing, human resource management, international business and\nstudent recruitment.\n\n\n\n**Alison Watson**\n\n**Programme Leader for BA (Hons) Business**\n\nArden

writing and team working skills. Photograph:\nJeff Blackler/Rex Features\n\nThrough its Access All Areas (AAA) programme, professional services firm KPMG\nis bringing rewarding careers in companies including its own closer to young\npeople from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nSocial mobility in the accountancy profession has been in a significant\ndecline, according to the [Social Mobility and Child Poverty\nCommission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/social-mobility-and-\nchild-poverty-commission). Recognising that this presented a substantial\nbusiness risk, KPMG responded with AAA, a suite of educational and outreach\nprogrammes that aims to increase career awareness, motivation and\nemployability among young people who face challenging circumstances.\n\nWorking with 328 schools and colleges, KPMG sees AAA as a long-term investment\nin its future and the future of young people across the UK. In 2014, KPMG\nprovided 231 school leaver and internship roles, and supported 12,000 young\npeople with careers advice, employability workshops and work experience. Among\nthese, 44% of those on STARS, a 12-month school leaver programme, secured\npermanent roles at KPMG, 52% went to university, and 4% pursued other\nopportunities.\n\nAfter taking part in \u201cwork ready\u201d, the company\u2019s employability skills\nworkshop, 91% of students had a better understanding of what employers want\nand 84% felt it improved their CV writing and team working skills.\n\nThese are just a fraction of the programme\u2019s successes and the company is now\none of the government\u2019s 12 \u201csocial mobility business compact champions\u201d. The\nselection panel praised the way KPMG targets young people facing some of the\nmost significant barriers to unlocking their potential.\n\nTo make sure AAA reaches those communities where the challenges are greatest,\nthe company continues to evaluate its process for targeting schools. Recent\nimprovements include the introduction of an algorithm to assess schools on\nsocio-economic disadvantage and educational attainment.\n\nHaving expanded programmes initially launched in London to other locations,\nKPMG\u2019s next task is to open its doors to more school-leavers around the\ncountry.\n\nTopics\n\n  * [ Guardian sustainable business ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sustainable-business)\n  * [ Sustainability case studies ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/sustainability-case-studies)\n\n  * [ sponsored features ](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/sponsoredfeatures)\n\n  * [ Share on Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb \"Facebook\")\n  * [ Share on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=KPMG%20works%20hard%20to%20promote%20social%20mobility&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw \"Twitter\")\n  * [ Share via Email ](mailto:?subject=KPMG%20works%20hard%20to%20promote%20social%20mobility&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_link \"Email\")\n  * [ Share on LinkedIn ](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=KPMG%20works%20hard%20to%20promote%20social%20mobility&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [ Share on Pinterest ](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility \"Pinterest\")\n  * [ Share on WhatsApp ](whatsapp://send?text=%22KPMG%20works%20hard%20to%20promote%20social%20mobility%22%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_wa \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ Share on Messenger ](fb-messenger://share?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_me&app_id=180444840287 \"Messenger\")\n\n  * [ Reuse this content ](https://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Fapr%2F30%2Fkpmg-works-hard-to-promote-social-mobility&type=article&internalpagecode=2276489 \"Reuse this content\")\n\n##  [Most popular](https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/sustainable-business)\n\n  * [ News ](https://www.theguardian.com/international)\n  * [ Opinion ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree)\n  * [ Sport ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sport)\n  * [ Culture ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/culture)\n  * [ Lifestyle ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lifeandstyle)\n\n    * [ Contact us ](https://www.theguardian.com/help/contact-us)\n    * [ Complaints & corrections ](https://www.theguardian.com/info/complaints-and-corrections)\n    * [ SecureDrop ](https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop)\n    * [ Work for us ](https://workforus.theguardian.com)\n    * [ Privacy policy ](https://www.theguardian.com/info/privacy)\n    * [ Cookie policy ](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies)\n    * [ Terms & conditions ](https://www.theguardian.com/help/terms-of-service)\n    * [ Help ](https://www.theguardian.com/help)\n    * [ All topics ](https://www.theguardian.com/index/subjects/a)\n    * [ All writers ](https://www.theguardian.com/index/contributors)\n    * [ Digital newspaper archive ](https://theguardian.newspapers.com)\n    * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/theguardian)\n    * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/guardian)\n    * [ Advertise with us ](https://advertising.theguardian.com)\n    * [ Search UK jobs ](https://jobs.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=NGW_FOOTER_INT_GU_JOBS)\n    * [ Dating ](https://soulmates.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=soulmates_int_web_footer)\n    * [ Discount Codes ](https://discountcode.theguardian.com/)\n\nSupport The Guardian\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\n[ Contribute\n](https://support.theguardian.com/contribute?INTCMP=footer_support_contribute&acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22:%22ACQUISITIONS_FOOTER%22,%22componentId%22:%22footer_support_contribute%22,%22source%22:%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%7D)\n[ Subscribe\n](https://support.theguardian.com/subscribe?INTCMP=footer_support_subscribe&acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22:%22ACQUISITIONS_FOOTER%22,%22componentId%22:%22footer_support_subscribe%22,%22source%22:%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%7D)\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That\nmeans there's more pressure on HR leaders to separate what's hype from what's\nhelpful.\n\nAs a chief HR officer, chief people officer or other HR leader, you'll need to\nidentify which software is truly helpful and reject technology that doesn't\nreally bring value. That means choosing the tools that [support your\nstrategy](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade) and leaving aside those that qualify as\n\"shiny new objects.\"\n\nHere are eight HR technology trends for 2020 that you'll want to research.\n\n### __1.      Workforce experience tools\n\nNo list of current CHRO trends would be valid without mentioning workforce\nexperience tools. Workforce experience goes beyond employee experience to\ninclude the entire workforce.\n\nAn optimal workforce experience ensures high productivity, retention and\nengagement. Your workforce experience systems should include employees and\n[remote workers and contingent\nworkers](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/Critical-tips-for-\nmanaging-contingent-workers), who also contribute value to the company. Tools\nsuch as Qualtrics or SurveyGizmo represent the types of technologies that can\nhelp you gather feedback from employees and contingent workers, view sentiment\ntrends, and provide action plans to enhance your company's workforce\nexperience.\n\nBeware of vendors that market their HR suite as an all-encompassing workforce\nor employee experience suite. While many HR vendors have or are building out\nspecific experience capabilities, marketing that promotes a system as an end-\nto-end \"solution\" is overselling its capabilities.\n\n### __2.      Candidate experience tools\n\nAs [the war for talent](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/the-war-for-talent-\nits-real-heres-why-its-happening.html) has heated up over the last few years,\nmore HR leaders have recognized the importance of the candidate experience. If\nyou can't offer candidates a good experience throughout the recruiting and\nhiring process, you will likely lose top talent to competitors that do provide\nit.\n\n> Beware of vendors that market their HR suite as an all-encompassing\n> workforce or employee experience suite.  __\n\n[Creating a candidate journey\nmap](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/6-candidate-journey-mapping-\nsecrets-savvy-recruiters-HR-pros-know) can help you understand important\ntouchpoints. In addition, recruitment marketing and career site software are\ntools that enable you to optimize and personalize the candidate experience,\nmanage your candidate pool, and gather analytics to help you improve the\noverall experience. [Chatbots can\nalso](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-2-HR-chatbot-\nexamples-for-the-experience-driven-job-market) add a lot of value to the\ncandidate experience during the recruiting process if you use them in the\nright way.\n\n### __3.      AI and machine learning\n\nAI and machine learning are two of the most hyped technologies today, and many\nvendors are increasingly adding AI and machine learning capabilities to their\nproducts.\n\nAI tools -- [particularly\nchatbots](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-2-HR-chatbot-\nexamples-for-the-experience-driven-job-market) \\-- are becoming increasingly\nprevalent in the recruiting and identifying candidates. Machine learning is\ncomplementing AI, since it enables AI to continually learn as companies repeat\nthe hiring process.\n\nYou should understand that these terms are overused. In some cases, vendors\nclaim a product has AI or machine learning capabilities when that's not the\ncase. Another issue is that AI algorithms can be based on biased thinking,\nwhich in turn create biased results. You'll need to test capabilities to\nensure genuine transparent and fair decision-making. And don't forget that the\ntechnology is new and isn't always successful.\n\n\"Something like 70% of all chatbot implementations get turned off,\" said John\nSumser, founder of HRExaminer, in a [video on the state of\nAI](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/video/State-of-HR-AI-technology-\nlikened-to-early-days-of-flight).\n\n### __4.      Robotic processing automation\n\nAs the HR function becomes increasingly strategic, many HR leaders are turning\nto automation tools. A newer technology area that's getting a lot of attention\n-- and has a number of use cases -- is [robotic process\nautomation](https://searcherp.techtarget.com/feature/RPA-basics-What-it-is-\nbenefits-downsides-use-cases) (RPA).\n\n[RPA software enables HR\nautomation](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/8-uses-for-RPA-in-HR-\noperations) of certain processes that are often time-consuming and laborious,\nenabling your HR team to focus on value-adding activities. However, since\nthere aren't a lot of proven RPA offerings, you'll need to carefully vet the\nones you decide to use.\n\n### __5.      Employee wellness tools\n\nAs part of your [employee experience\nstrategy](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/How-to-create-an-\nemployee-journey-map) and to maintain a high level of productivity, employee\nwellness programs and software can be important.\n\nAside from helping to boost a company's reputation as a good place to work,\nemployee wellness programs provide real benefits to employees. They can help\nthem stay fit and healthy and thus a productive member of the organization.\nEmployee fitness and burnout are some areas where software can help you ensure\nemployees are keeping themselves work-ready. You can even consider offering\nprograms that help ameliorate the stress of modern life. [Mindfulness\nprograms](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/The-nine-best-ways-\nto-boost-workplace-mindfulness-success) and [financial wellness\nprograms](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Why-your-company-\nneeds-a-financial-wellness-program) are two areas that fall into this\ncategory.\n\n### __6.      People analytics\n\nDespite people -- or HR \u2013 analytics' status as a hot topic with industry\nanalysts and consultants, few companies and HR leaders have taken analytics as\nseriously as they should.\n\nAn integral part of better decision-making, analytics have become much more\naccessible for HR and executives in recent years. To this point, you might\nwant to consider researching how analytics could further your company's goals.\nMany [people analytics\ntools](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/video/Understand-why-people-\nanalytics-maturity-matters) provide predictive analytics and user-friendly\nsuggestions using natural language that are based on data analysis, and don't\nrequire a data scientist to decipher results. With that said, training your HR\nprofessionals or hiring specialists in data science will help you optimize\nyour analytics use.\n\n### __7.      Skills management tools\n\nIn an economy where virtually every company is fighting turnover and internal\nrecruiting is becoming more important, skills management tools are critical.\n\nYou need to accurately measure employee competencies against the [ones they\nneed for their roles](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/Fight-the-\nskills-gap-with-a-great-upskilling-and-reskilling-strategy), as well as ensure\nyour hiring is effective. Your HR system also needs to manage your skills\ncatalog and assign those skills to people and roles. In addition, it needs\nsearch capabilities to find people who can fill a role internally. Many\nvendors are building out skills technology and libraries and you can\ninvestigate whether these will add value to your organization.\n\n### __8.      Integration\n\nMany HR leaders use targeted software, but it's time to focus on integration\nif you haven't already done so.\n\nIntegrating applications can help your team create effective processes and\naccurate reporting to drive decision-making. If you are using a different\napplicant tracking system\n([ATS](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/applicant-tracking-\nsystem-ATS)), onboarding system and core HRIS, then you need to understand how\nexactly data will flow between these systems. For example, can you hire\nsomeone with the data from the ATS or are you going to have manually enter\ntheir data in the onboarding system and HRIS? These are real problems that\nimpact the efficiency of how HR operates, as well as the employee experience\nwithin your own HR team.\n\n####  Related Resources\n\n  * [Talent Management Systems](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1430133355_488.html) -ComputerWeekly.com\n  * [Why You Shouldn\u2019t Be Afraid of Deciding on a Talent Management System](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1579117861_62.html) -Cornerstone OnDemand\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Talent management systems\n\n  * [\n\n##### Spanish bank applies AI to staff training\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Karl-Flinders-profile-\nphoto-140x180px.jpeg) By: Karl Flinders\n](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252477006/Spanish-bank-applies-AI-to-\nstaff-training)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Top 2020 HR trends: Employee and candidate experience, AI and more\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade)\n\n  * [\n\n##### How to improve HR processes: 6 modern tools CHROs should consider\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/How-to-improve-HR-\nprocesses-6-modern-tools-CHROs-should-consider)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 4 future workplace trends HR should understand for 2020 and beyond\n\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/4-future-workplace-trends-HR-\nshould-understand-for-2020-and-beyond)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

Students then had an opportunity to speak\ndirectly with the Secretary and to share their decision-making process and\njourneys towards TAFE.\n\n\n\nMany students, a Chisholm spokesperson said, explained that working in ECE was\n\u201ca calling\u201d and that they had long wanted to work with children. For other\nstudents, it was their family and friends who had identified their passion for\neducation.\n\n\n\nThe Cert III students are amongst a wave of those completing ECE\nqualifications in line with the [$5 billion\ninvestment](https://thesector.com.au/2020/01/28/universal-kinder-arrives-for-\nvictorias-three-year-olds/) outlined by the Victorian Government to be spent\nover the next decade to provide access to a full 15 hours per week of\nsubsidised three-year-old kindergarten by 2029.\n\n\n\nThis year, the State Government ushered in the start of two new free TAFE\ncourses in ECE - [Certificate III in Early Childhood Education and Care\n(CHC30113)](https://www.chisholm.edu.au/courses/certificate-iii/early-\nchildhood-education-and-care), and the [Diploma of Early Childhood Education\nand Care (CHC50113)](https://www.chisholm.edu.au/courses/diploma/early-\nchildhood-education-and-care). The courses, added to the f[ree TAFE list\n](https://www.chisholm.edu.au/free-tafe-for-priority-courses)from 2020, is one\nway the state government is hoping to fill thousands of jobs that will become\navailable over the next five years as the kinder program is extended by an\nadditional year, to include three-year-olds.\n\n\n\nChisholm CEO Stephen Varty said the visit by the Parliamentary Secretary and\nMember for Frankston was a fantastic opportunity to showcase the new ECE\nfacilities at Frankston campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor Early Childhood Education, we have playrooms and technologies to support\nour teachers to deliver the best in education, and that provide the best\nlearning experiences for our students. We work with the ECE sector to start\nplacement from Term 2, and this prepares our students to be work-ready and\nconnected with their professional peers, even before they graduate,\u201d Mr Varty\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe Frankston campus Early Childhood Education facilities are part of the [$85\nmillion Stage 1 redevelopment of the\ncampus](https://www.chisholm.edu.au/about-us/media/chisholm-unveils-the-\nfuture-of-tafe-in-frankston), which was completed and launched in 2019.

In addition, a 2019 report by the\nOffice for National Statistics revealed that nearly 1.5 million jobs in\nEngland are at risk of automation.\"\n\nWhile many fear that automation will render work done by human beings\nmeaningless, this latest research compounds the idea that it just means the\ngraduates need to 'future-proof' themselves with skillsets that cannot be\nachieved by automation.\n\nThe impact the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) will have on the future\nworkforce has been the subject of many debates and discussions.\n\n> Integrative knowledge building, skills for lifelong learning and close\n> partnerships with employers are all key to ensuring that technology\n> graduates are work-ready in the fourth industrial revolution\n> [#LCTTheory](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LCTTheory?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#lifelonglearning](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lifelonglearning?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#Employability](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Employability?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#Digitalapprenticeships](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Digitalapprenticeships?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> <https://t.co/tOKNmvMT5B>\n>\n> \u2014 Janet Francis (@JanetSFrancis) [April 28,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/JanetSFrancis/status/1122396420538085376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nMethods of learning such as memorisation and standardised testing are becoming\noutdated as humans will no longer be needed for tasks that require these type\nof skills in the future - there will be robots for that.\n\nUniversities are increasingly preparing students for the future workforce by\nincorporating more practical learning within course structures.\n\nThey are offering students work experience opportunities such as internships,\nindustry-linked projects, networking opportunities, and more, so they can\ndevelop the soft skills needed in a future fueled by automation and new\ntechnologies.\n\nEven on a K12 education level, schools around the world are adopting 21st\ncentury learning methods to teach kids how to develop problem-solving,\ncollaborative thinking, and critical thinking, to prepare them for the future.\n\nPareto Law is also offering [training courses](https://www.pareto.co.uk/sales-\ntraining/our-courses/) to ensure graduates are equipped with the necessary\nskills to succeed.\n\nJonathan Fitchew, CEO of Pareto Law, said, \"With the graduation season upon us\nwe wanted to help graduates understand the skills they\u2019ll be expected to have\nwhen applying for entry level roles in 2019 and beyond.\n\n\"While traditional \u2018hard\u2019 skills are still important, with technology\nimpacting jobs in an unprecedented way, it\u2019s clear that graduates need to be\nstrengthening their soft skills to prepare for the future of work.\"\n\n## **Liked this?

Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) for\nhealthcare services that were never provided to federal workers suffering from\nwork related injuries, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nSanders is to be sentenced at a later date.\n\nTWR had clinics in five states including Federal Work Ready in Houston, Alamo\nWork Ready in San Antonio and Bayou Work Ready in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nDuring the criminal trial, the jury heard testimony from 38 witnesses\nincluding former patients of TWR clinics, former employees of TWR clinics,\nvarious experts and special agents from the USPS-OIG and IRS-CI.\n\nAccording to testimony, TWR submitted approximately $9.6 million in false and\nfraudulent claims from four of its clinics for physical therapy services that\nwere not provided. The claims were submitted under the Federal Employees\nCompensation Act (FECA) health care benefit program which is administered by\nthe DOL - OWCP.\n\nDOL-OWCP's chief fiscal officer said at trial that FECA does not pay for\nprofessional services performed by unlicensed aides which is why DOL-OWCP\nrequires the enrollment of all licensed professionals providing services to\ninjured federal employees, including copies of professional licenses.\n\nHe testified that the FECA program only considers chiropractors as physicians\nwhen they treat spinal subluxation. Otherwise, chiropractors are considered\nequivalent to physical therapists and may provide physical therapy under the\ndirection of, and as prescribed by, a medical doctor.\n\nSpecifically, in relation to this case, the DOL-OWCP would not have paid\nmillions of dollars for the physical therapy services billed by TWR if they\nhad known that the services were not provided as described in the claims\nsubmitted to DOL-OWCP.\n\nThe claims TWR submitted falsely and fraudulently described skilled one-on-one\nphysical therapy services provided by a licensed chiropractor. Patients from\nfour TWR clinics testified that they did not receive the one-on-one physical\ntherapy services paid for by DOL-OWCP under FECA.\n\nFormer employees testified that they did not perform all the one-on-one\nservices documented on patient treatment notes and admitted they frequently\ncompleted the patient treatment notes at the end of the day by following a\n\"cheat sheet\" and asking each other and the patients what activities had been\ndone.\n\nAssistant United States Attorneys Julie Redlinger and Daniel Rodriguez\nprosecuted the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson handled the\nforfeiture matters.\n\n_Source: U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of Texas_\n\nWas this article valuable?\n\nYes No\n\nThank you!

[David Paschall](/staff/david-paschall/)\n\n![](https://media.timesfreepress.com/img/photos/2020/01/11/1578783959_Jamie-\nNewman_gs_t800_h0af056a72ddea731730cb42a2af0a8dc1639e8ad.jpg) Wake Forest\nphoto / Former Wake Forest quarterback Jamie Newman has enrolled at Georgia as\na graduate transfer for the 2020 season.\n\nGeorgia will have another proven quarterback for the 2020 season, though his\nnext snap against a Southeastern Conference opponent will be his first.\n\nJamie Newman, who guided Wake Forest to an 8-5 record and a berth in the\nPinstripe Bowl this season, announced Saturday via Twitter that he will be\nplaying his final year for Kirby Smart's Bulldogs. Newman cited Smart and\noffensive coordinator James Coley as reasons why he selected Georgia over\nother graduate-transfer opportunities around the country.\n\n\"As I look ahead, I am excited about joining such a great football program\nunder the leadership of Coach Smart and Coach Coley,\" Newman said. \"I believe\nin UGA's amazing staff, great football program and the passionate fans\nsupporting this team. Most importantly, I am ready to get to work, ready to\nmake new friendships and am committed to contributing to this great program.\"\n\nFormer Georgia coach Mark Richt reacted on Twitter to Newman's change of\nlocation by posting, \"I have been watching Jamie Newman all season with the\nACC Network. Georgia just landed a great one! I predict he will be the best\nquarterback in the SEC!\"\n\nNewman, a 6-foot-4, 230-pounder from Graham, North Carolina, was a three-star\nsignee in 2016 and the nation's No. 17 dual-threat quatrterback, a position\ngroup headed that year by Jarrett Guarantano and Jalen Hurts. After\nredshirting the 2016 season and playing just 22 snaps in 2017, with 17 of\nthose coming in a 51-7 opening rout of Presbyterian, Newman became Wake\nForest's starting quarterback late in the 2018 season.\n\nAs a redshirt junior this season, Newman completed 220 of 361 passes (60.9%)\nfor 2,826 yards with 26 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also rushed for\n574 yards and six scores but on New Year's Eve announced that he would be\nleaving Winston-Salem.\n\n\"My decision has been primarily based on my need to develop further and my\ndesire to stretch myself to prepare for the next level,\" Newman posted on\nTwitter when revealing his transfer announcement.\n\nGeorgia's starting quarterback the past three seasons, Jake Fromm, announced\nWednesday that he would be[ forgoing his final year of\neligibility](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/sports/college/story/2020/jan/08/georgias-\njake-fromm-leaving-early-nfl-draft/512498/ \"Fromm forgoing senior season\") and\nwould enter the NFL draft. The only other scholarship quarterbacks for the\nBulldogs this season have been redshirt sophomore Stetson Bennett and true\nfreshman D'Wan Mathis.\n\n[Bennett is a former Bulldogs walk-\non](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/sports/college/story/2019/sep/09/stetsbennett-\ngaining-confidence-jake-fromms-b/503168/ \"Stetson Bennett feature\") who played\nthe 2018 season at Jones County (Mississippi) Community College before\nreturning, while Mathis had a cyst removed from his brain last spring and\nnever went through a full-contact practice. Georgia added four-star\nquarterback Carson Beck of Jacksonville, Florida, during last month's early\nsigning period.\n\nNewman instantly vaults to the favorite role this spring, with Pro Football\nFocus recently rating him college football's third-best returning quarterback\nbehind Clemson's Trevor Lawrence and Ohio State's Justin Fields.\n\nA glowing critique of Newman by PFF reads, \"The tight-window passing he has\nput on display has been next level and a large reason why he is highly sought\nafter on the transfer market. Joe Burrow is far and away the highest-graded\nquarterback throwing to a tight window, but Newman is second and third isn't\nanywhere near him. Newman has some rushing ability and has seen the eighth-\nmost designed rushes for a quarterback (128).\n\n\"While some may say it's his rushing that can be his greatest weapon, it's\nclearly his arm.\"\n\nNewman could become Georgia's first graduate-transfer starting quarterback\n[since Greyson Lambert]( \"Lambert\"), who arrived from Virginia in 2015 and\nstarted that season for the Bulldogs. Lambert started Georgia's 2016 opener\nagainst North Carolina but was beaten out by Jacob Eason, who lost the job to\nFromm a year later.\n\n_Contact David Paschall at dpaschall@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6524._\n\nNext Article\n\n##  [Mocs respond after a tough loss with a blowout win over\nSamford](/news/sports/college/story/2020/jan/12/mocs-respond-after-tough-loss-\nblowout-wover-s/512804/)\n\n  \nPrevious Article\n\n##  [Area sports notes: UTC wrestlers overwhelm Gardner-\nWebb](/news/sports/college/story/2020/jan/13/aresports-notes-utc-wrestlers-\noverwhelm-gardn/512843/)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPreps Sports\n\nChoose a school from the list to see related news coverage\n\n\\-- select --  Baylor Bledsoe County Boyd Buchanan Bradley Central Brainerd\nCalhoun CCS CSAS Central Chattooga Cleveland Copper Basin Dade County Dalton\nEast Hamilton East Ridge Gordon Central Gordon Lee Grace Academy Grundy County\nGPS Heritage Hixson Howard Ider LaFayette LFO Lookout Valley Marion County\nMcCallie McMinn Central McMinn County Meigs County Murray County North Jackson\nNorth Sand Mountain Northwest Whitfield Notre Dame Ooltewah Polk County Red\nBank Rhea County Ridgeland Ringgold Sale Creek Sequatchie County Sequoyah\nSoutheast Whitfield Signal Mountain Silverdale Soddy-Daisy Sonoraville South\nPittsburg St. Andrew's -

show me and I\nmay remember; involve me and I\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nBusiness schools that are most successful in producing work-ready graduates\nare those that involve them, or those that encompass professional development\nalong with their academic coursework.\n\nThis means rather than just research, presentations and publications, students\nare encouraged to make connections in industry through work placements,\nvisiting speakers, cross-disciplinary learning, and being exposed to society\nat large via an international outlook or community engagement.\n\nWhile students often look at a school\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s graduate starting\nsalary, cost or location; ultimately the best school will be one that helps\nyou reach your unique set of goals. Here are a few things to look for when\nundergoing the search for your most suited business school:\n\n\n\n###### ![photo-1452830978618-d6feae7d0ffa\n](/sites/default/files/uploads/photo-1452830978618-d6feae7d0ffa.jpg)  \nImage via [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/tZnbakTUcTI)\n\n\n\n### Good connections\n\nStudents at schools that are connected with industry are generally able to\nestablish contacts with future employers, and therefore find it easier to\nenter the job market. In this way, not only do companies benefit from student\nresources to strengthen their employer brand, but schools can prepare their\neducational content in order to meet industry requirements.\n\n### Cross-disciplinary approach\n\nTo act on problems facing the world today, it\u2019s best to analyse them with the\nmost appropriate tools. This can sometimes involve cross-disciplinary\napproaches and inter-institution collaboration. Schools that offer a variety\nof learning methods via lectures, workshops, speakers, resources across\ncampus, or partnerships with other universities or centres are able to better\nimpart key transferable skills to their students.\n\n### International approach\n\nWhile many schools have connections with local business, the importance of\nstrategic partnerships with industries and universities beyond this is an\nideal way to develop academic co-operation, exchanges and recruitment. This\nenriches the learning environment and helps students develop a responsible\nattitude towards societal problems.\n\n### Research based education\n\nEducation that encourages a scientific mindset, systematic critical thinking\nand rigor is the best way for students to attain required knowledge within\ntheir chosen field. Allowing them to be actively involved in research cements\nthat process further as they learn and understand from being involved. The\nprocess of internalizing, practicing and following research conduct helps them\nlearn how to work independently, as a team, as well as to effectively monitor\nthe entire research process.\n\n\n\n###### ![photo-1452830978618-d6feae7d0ffa  3693\n](/sites/default/files/uploads/3693.jpg)  \nImage courtesy of the University of Gothenburg\n\n\n\nTom Bodett an American author, politician, voice actor, and radio host, once\nsaid that the difference between school and life was, \u201cIn school, you\u2019re\ntaught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you\u2019re given a test that\nteaches you a lesson.\u201d Here are some business schools that combine these\nlessons and tests through a combination of development and academia, in to\noffer their students a springboard into the business world:\n\n### [SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, ECONOMICS AND LAW, UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG -\nSWEDEN](http://handels.gu.se/english)\n\nThe [School of Business, Economics and Law](http://handels.gu.se/english) is\nthe only school in Sweden that has a triple crown accreditation from EQUIS,\nAACSB and AMBA; a privilege held by just 0.5% of the world\u2019s business schools,\nhighlighting the extent of its high quality education.\n\nLocated in the friendly city of Gothenburg, the school attracts 3,700 students\neach year, and partners with about 30 companies and 160 universities.

Skills Minister Michaelia Cash has sought to lift the profile\nof vocational education and training, saying that for many it is a better\nincome path than going to university and the economic benefits were broader.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nSenator Cash flagged new measures to encourage people from welfare to work.\nAlex Ellinghausen\n\n\"University is for learning, VET is for earning,'' Senator Cash told a small\nbusiness breakfast on the Gold Coast on Monday.\n\n\"And what we are hearing from employers is that we need to ensure that you\nhave work-ready employees from day one,'' she said.\n\n\"That is exactly what vocational education is going to give you \u2013 for both the\nemployee and yourself as the employer.\"\n\nThe government committed [$525 million towards skills training in the April 2\nbudget.](https://www.afr.com/news/economy/federal-budget-2019-skills-package-\nto-increase-apprenticeship-payments-20190402-1o252g) It included 80,000\nadditional apprenticeships over five years in occupations facing shortages\nincluding bakers, carpenters, bricklayers and plumbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Cash's office stressed the minister was not maligning universities but\nmaking the point that university was not for everybody.\n\nFurthermore, skills delivered through VET benefited individuals, businesses\nand the economy more broadly.\n\nDepartmental projections show the majority of new jobs in the five years to\nMay 2023 will require post-secondary qualifications. And seven out of 10 of\nthe fastest growing occupations require a VET qualification.\n\nSenator Cash also flagged new measures to encourage people from welfare to\nwork.\n\n\"We will never make excuses, we will always get people off welfare and into\nwork,'' she said.\n\n\"We will continue to look at what more we can do to get people off welfare and\ninto work because the greatest gift you can ever give a person in life, is the\nopportunity of work and we will never resile from that.\"\n\nSenator Cash's speech came amid growing calls for the government to increase\nthe Newstart allowance, following its announcement at the weekend [to lower\nthe deeming rate](https://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/pension-rise-accounts-\nfor-very-strong-asx-returns-20190714-p5270x) for part pensioners to compensate\nfor falling interest rates.\n\nLabor went to the election promising to review Newstart with a view to\nincreasing the payment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers reiterated the call on Monday.\n\n\"The concerns that have been raised about Newstart are well founded. Labor is,\nat best, three years away from government. So the ball is in the government's\ncourt.''\n\nThe Coalition remains steadfastly opposed to any increase to Newstart beyond\nits indexation to inflation.\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\n[License\narticle](http://rightsportal.copyright.com.au/pages/republicationpage.aspx?author=Phillip%20Coorey&publication=AFR&publicationdate=2019-07-15T06%3A22%3A57Z&publisher=fxj&title='University%20is%20for%20learning%2C%20VET%20is%20for%20earning'&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffederal%2Funiversity-\nis-for-learning-vet-is-for-earning-20190715-p527dh)\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [Michaelia Cash](/person/michaelia-clare-cash-4gk)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [University](/topic/university-63k)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n **[Phillip Coorey](/by/phillip-coorey-hve1e)** is the Political Editor based\nin Canberra.

University, Study\nCentres](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/author/charles-sturt-\nuniversity/) | January 21, 2020\n\n3490\n\nSOCIAL BUZZ\n\nTechnology is advancing at an accelerated pace, powering or transforming just\nabout every industry imaginable. As it is an indispensable part of business,\nthis makes the field of computing and information technology (IT) an exciting\nfield to branch into.\n\nWhile a Bachelor in IT - or a related field - serves as a stepping stone into\nthe industry, maintaining a competitive edge in the future workforce entails\nequipping oneself with further knowledge and skills to capitalise on the\nbigger opportunities in the field.\n\nAccording to the [US Bureau of Labor and\nStatistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-\ntechnology/home.htm), computer and IT occupations are projected to grow 12\npercent from 2018 to 2028 - much faster than the average for all occupations.\nThey add that these occupations are projected to add about 546,200 new jobs,\nas demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud\ncomputing, the collection and storage of big data as well as information\nsecurity.\n\nGraduates who are looking to future-proof their careers and receive a forward\nthinking education might want to consider doing so at [Charles Sturt\nUniversity Study Centres](http://www.csustudycentres.edu.au/).

A career in data science can lead to\nroles in product management, education management, consulting, business\nintelligence development, among others, across numerous industries.\n\nMeanwhile, cyber security graduates can go on to become security specialists,\nsecurity engineers or network security managers, which can lead to information\nsecurity officer positions and security architect roles.\n\nA graduate degree in the field can also serve as a sound investment. For\ninstance, a data scientist with one to two years of experience can earn\nanywhere from AU$100,000 to AU$113,000 per year on average, according to\n[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Salaries/australia-data-scientist-\nsalary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IN16_KO10,24.htm). Meanwhile, [cyber security\nanalysts](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Salaries/australia-cyber-security-\nanalyst-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IN16_KO10,32.htm) can earn between AU$56,000 to\nAU$111,000 whereas a [cyber security\nconsultant](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Salaries/australia-cyber-security-\nconsultant-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IN16_KO10,35.htm) can earn up to AUS$85,000.\n\nTo boot, their MIT programme is accredited by the Australian Computer Society\n(ACS) and is rated five stars by the Good Universities Guide 2019. Coupled\nwith the fact that the universities graduates have an employment rate of 87.5\npercent - 14 percent higher than the national average - in addition to being\namong the nations\u2019 highest earners - with an average starting salary of\nAUS$63,400 compared to the national average of AUS$61,000 - it\u2019s clear that a\ndegree from this institution will give students a competitive edge in their\ncareers.\n\n_Follow Charles Sturt University Study Centres on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/CSUSydney?ref=hl) _,_[\n_Instagram_](https://www.instagram.com/csustudycentres/) _and_[\n_YouTube_](https://www.youtube.com/user/CSUStudyCentres)\n\n## **Liked this?

On Oct. 6, it pledged to set up the first U.S. apprenticeship system in\ntourism and to launch 370 apprenticeship positions over the next five years in\nareas such as culinary arts and housekeeping. Hilton made the pledge at a\nmeeting of [the Global Apprenticeships Network (GAN)](http://www.gan-\nglobal.org/), a coalition of companies, employer federations, associations and\ninternational organizations working to promote quality apprenticeships and\nwork-readiness programs around the world.  \n\n\"The hotel and hospitality area is not something you ordinarily think of [for\napprenticeships], but the nature of the work and the nature of jobs [in that\nindustry] are changing,\" said Dan Marshall, legislative and policy specialist\nfor workforce issues and director of the Working for America Institute of the\nAFL-CIO.  \n  \nHe was among speakers at the summit that drew people from Argentina, Brazil,\nColombia, France, Indonesia, Malawi, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and\nthe United States to discuss apprenticeships as a solution to youth\nunemployment in a way that ensures training matches company and industry\nneeds. The summit was preceded by a private discussion at the White House that\nincluded Thomas Perez, U.S. Secretary of Labor, and Matthew Colangelo, who\nserves as an economic policy advisor to the president.\n\nApprenticeships in the U.S. often are associated with manufacturing jobs and\nvocational training that is an alternative to a four-year college degree.\nHowever, apprenticeships are being created in other sectors, summit speakers\nnoted. For example:  \n  \n\n  * IBM has created a three-year training program for business or technical specialists in which apprentices are considered for permanent employment.   \n\n  * Nestle offers apprenticeships and traineeships in Europe, the Americas and elsewhere.   \n\n  * MasterCard Foundation's Youth Livelihoods program prepares young people for entry-level employment or entrepreneurship in the fields of agribusiness, health, hospitality and construction.   \n\n  * Samsung Tech Institutes provide technical training in areas such as software development and computer programming. In 2014, Samsung launched a two-year web designer training program in France.\n\n\"Business leaders can be the best ambassadors for these programs. We have\ncrisscrossed the globe to learn about the [apprenticeship] models in other\ncountries,\" said Christopher P. Lu, deputy secretary for the Department of\nLabor (DOL).  \n  \n\"We need to look for opportunities to move [apprenticeships] into different\ntypes of careers,\" he added. The DOL's [Registered\nApprenticeship](https://www.doleta.gov/OA/apprentices.cfm) program offers\naccess to 1,000 career areas that can lead to jobs such as a pipefitter,\ncarpenter and electrician, as well as chef, dental assistant, fire and medical\nprofessional, law enforcement agent, and child care development specialist.\n\nGetting Young Workers Involved\n\nOne challenge is \"changing the mindsets of parents, guidance counselors [and]\nstudents,\" Lu said. Businesses and schools need to create on- and off-ramps to\ncareers and offer apprenticeships as educational components so students \"have\na credential and a pathway for a four-year degree\" if desired, he said.  \n  \nHe noted that [in 2015, the DOL awarded $175 million in American\nApprenticeship\nGrants](https://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ETA20151762.htm) to\norganizations to help train and hire more than 34,000 new apprentices in high-\ngrowth, high-tech industries such as health care, information technology and\nadvanced manufacturing within the next five years.  \n  \nAnd at the summit, the DOL [Bureau of International Labor Affairs announced it\nwas awarding GAN $1.4 million over two\nyears](http://www.publicnow.com/view/02DFA6683BB8A84A358D47E7CB85F17E73B6E251?2016-10-06-21:01:42+01:00-xxx3202)\nto support global apprenticeships. The DOL also will encourage U.S.-based and\ninternational apprenticeship networks to share best practices, according to a\nnews release about the award.  \n  \n\"Youth unemployment is a global problem,\" Lu said, \"and work-based learning is\na part of that solution.\"  \n  \nLynn Shotwell, executive director of the SHRM affiliate Council for Global\nImmigration (CFGI), concurred. Businesses as well as young workers will profit\nfrom apprenticeships, she told SHRM Online.  \n  \n\"The skills gap impacts employers of all sizes and all industries around the\nglobe,\" she said. \"It is exciting to see the GAN and DOL working with\nemployers to prepare youth for the jobs of the future.\"  \n  \nShotwell noted that \"SHRM members can tap into these existing networks to help\ngrow their own talent pipelines\" and pointed to the [DOL website as a source\nfor information on grants and a variety of apprenticeship\nmodels](https://www.dol.gov/featured/apprenticeship/grants) being used.  \n  \nJennifer Mishory, executive director and a founding staff member at [Young\nInvincibles\u2014a Washington, D.C.-based\nnonprofit](http://younginvincibles.org/about/) representing the interests of\npeople ages 18 to 34 years old\u2014said young people need to be educated about\napprenticeships.  \n  \nThey often cannot afford to take an unpaid internship that would help them\ngain the experience that employers seek, and they may be unaware that\napprenticeships are an \"earn while you learn\" program, she said. They also may\nnot realize that apprenticeships can prepare them for the modern-day workforce\nand think an apprenticeship program would mean forgoing college.  \n  \nShe recommended promoting apprenticeships by:  \n  \n\n  * Using graduates of apprenticeships as ambassadors. \n  * Making sure young people know that apprenticeships are paid opportunities. Some employers, such as banking company UBS, offer their apprentices benefits equivalent to what permanent employees receive. \n  * Using social media to promote apprenticeships.  \n\n  \nLinda Kromjong, secretary general of the International Organization of\nEmployers, called upon schools to build in apprenticeship opportunities as\npart of their curriculums. And employers should be willing to hire an\napprentice over a candidate who does not have similar training, said Ned\nMcCulloch, global issues manager for skill development and education at IBM's\ngovernmental program function.  \n  \n[National Apprenticeship Week begins Nov.\n14](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/NAW/).  \n  \n\n[Training and Development](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Training and\nDevelopment)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Apprenticeships%3a+One+Way+to+Create+a+Work-\nReady+Talent+Pool&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/organizational-and-employee-development/Pages/Apprenticeships-One-Way-\nto-Create-a-Work-Ready-Talent-Pool.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Check it out:\nhttps://meconstructionnews.com/39426/university-of-manchester-launches-new-\nmasters-degree-for-middle-east-professionals) **\n\nNew programme is the latest in a growing portfolio of blended Masters degrees\nfor working professionals offered in the region\n\n**\n\n![](https://meconstructionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prof-Selma-\nCarson_Manchester-University_1000x600.jpg)\n\nThe University of Manchester has launched a new part-time master\u2019s degree in\nthe Middle East. It is designed for people working in the real estate industry\nand associated professional services or working professionals with an interest\nin building a career in real estate.\n\nAs per a statement, the MSc Real Estate programme is delivered in a part-time\nblended learning format, suitable for working professionals, with the\nopportunity to join face-to-face course conferences with faculty and peers, in\nDubai. The new programme is accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered\nSurveyors (RICS) and is taught by a team of leading academics experienced in\nthe global real estate industry, the university states.\n\nThe programme is said to be designed to meet the needs of professionals in a\ndynamic global industry, which is facing a range of issues such as rapid\nurbanisation and the challenge to urban planning; climate change and energy\nsustainability; digital transformation (prop-tech) and changing end-user\nlifestyles and expectations.\n\n\u201cThe real estate sector is at the heart of many local and regional economies\nand is one of the world\u2019s largest industries, attracting investment and\ntalent, and creating wealth and career opportunities. The built environment is\nalso at the core of the quality of life for all communities but is being\nchallenged. Recent research has highlighted the need for real estate\nprofessionals to add value by providing leadership in providing solutions\nrather than just traditional technical skills. The changing nature of real\nestate requires new skills, from hospitality to data analytics,\u201d explained\nProfessor Selma Carson FRICS FCIArb FHEA, programme director for the MSc Real\nEstate at The University of Manchester.\n\nThe MSc Real Estate programme is said to encompass academic excellence with\nthe development of transferable skills that are essential for a career in real\nestate in the private or public sector, internationally. It is designed as an\nintensive fast-track conversion course for the Royal Institution of Chartered\nSurveyors (RICS). The key themes are commercial awareness, globalisation, and\nsustainability, understanding the role of real estate in society, business,\nand the end-user. Students in the Middle East are likely to be working in real\nestate or a related field, such as banking, real estate finance, or\ndevelopment, the educational institution said.\n\nCarson added, \u201cThis is the essence of our MSc in Real Estate and we aim to\nhelp our students develop the necessary skills, knowledge and professionalism\nto compete effectively in a challenging regional and global market. The\nprogramme is designed as an intensive fast-track conversion course and\ncombines academic excellence with the development of the transferable skills\nthat are essential for a successful career in real estate.\u201d\n\nRelated Items:[education](https://meconstructionnews.com/topics/education),\n[real estate](https://meconstructionnews.com/topics/real-estate), [Royal\nInstitution of Chartered

[+] (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nMcGraw-Hill Education\u2019s (MHE) survey on readying college graduates for the\nworkforce is hot off the press. With the school year just around the corner, a\nnew crop of graduates gearing up for their job search after summer break and a\nrobust economy, this survey is timely. In fact, for the class of 2018, 44% of\nemployers will increase hiring of new college graduates.\n\n**Essential career readiness skills are not what you think.**\n\nMHE reports that only four in 10 college students feel very or extremely\nprepared for their future careers. Even though this figure is better this year\nthan last, it is still low.\n\nWhereby over half of college graduates surveyed believed they were well\nprepared for the workplace in \u201cessential career readiness skills\u201d like\nprofessionalism and work ethic (77%), critical thinking and problem solving\n(63%), and oral and written communication (61%), employers\u2019 perception of\ncareer readiness was lower, namely (43%) for professionalism, (56%) for\ncritical thinking and (42%) for communication. That\u2019s divided thinking.\nTechnical skills don\u2019t seem to be a big issue for either students or\nemployers. Interpersonal skills are. Only in teamwork and collaboration did\ncollege grads (73%) and employers (77%) see eye-to-eye.\n\nIt is important to note, says Susan Gouijnstook, VP of Learning Solutions\nStrategy at McGraw-Hill, that a gender disparity around confidence in\nworkplace skills showed up again this year in McGraw-Hill\u2019s Future Workforce\nSurvey. In fact, 50% of men compared to 36% of women feel like they are\n\u201ccareer ready.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nWhere does the ball drop in providing college grads (and all young adults for\nthat matter) with essential career readiness skills?\n\nWhether it\u2019s early college high schools, community colleges, apprenticeship\nprograms, or four-year colleges everybody is stepping up to the plate. All are\nembarking on endeavors to facilitate the pathway from school to work. MHE\u2019s\nfindings have important implications across the board for America\u2019s nascent\nworkforce.\n\nMore and more early college high schools and community colleges are teaming up\nwith industry partners to produce work-ready students with specialized skills.\nAs Shasta Buchanan, (Associate Vice President, Austin Community College)\narticulated, \u201cIn Austin (TX), our high schools, community college and large\nemployers like Dell, Samsung and Seton Medical Center are working together to\nbuild pipelines of jobs for young adults in cybersecurity, health sciences and\napplied manufacturing. Job shadowing and mentoring comprise an impressive\nquarter of the curriculum. Industry partners embed them into their training.\u201d\nSimilarly, the Obama and Trump Administrations have committed hundreds of\nmillions of dollars to create registered apprenticeships in high demand\nindustries to skill up workers in energy, medical services, technology and the\ntrades. Not only do you earn while you learn as an apprentice, and gain a\nreputable certification upon graduation, but these programs also have\nsignificant mentorship components.\n\nThe importance of mentors cannot be overstated. Based on their years of\nexperience, advising and reflecting on interpersonal skills are part and\nparcel of a good mentor\u2019s repertoire in helping young employees succeed in the\nworkplace.\n\n**Assessing problem-solving abilities replaces standardized testing.**\n\nAnd four-year colleges are gearing up to provide their graduates with career-\nready skills. MHE, explained Ms. Gouijnstook, is using survey results to\ninform product development and help college instructors zero in on essential\ncareer readiness skills - to \u201cunlock the potential of each learner\u201d \u2013 by\nleveraging learning science to create tools that support application of\nlearning and authentic assessments. If you don\u2019t know the term, authentic\nassessment, it\u2019s one you should become familiar with. \u201cThrough our products,\nwe seek to help students improve critical thinking skills, learn to\ncommunicate more effectively and perform real-world tasks through meaningful\napplication of fundamental knowledge,\u201d said Ms. Gouijnstook. The classroom\nbecomes a laboratory for applied knowledge. MHE is a significant player in\nbringing these kinds of skills to schools and making students work ready.\n\n**Practice makes perfect.**\n\nFinally, in addressing MHE\u2019s findings on college grad\u2019s confidence levels,\nNick Corcodilos (CEO, Ask The Headhunter) observes, \u201cBy being exposed to the\nworkplace early, whether by internship, apprenticeship, volunteer\nopportunities or authentic assessment, young adults develop a clear sense of\nexpectations and increased confidence. Experience speaks volumes.\u201d Along these\nlines, just over half of all students surveyed by MHE believed professional\nexperience and internships would better prepare them for the workforce. Adding\nfuel to this fire, in the MHE survey, nontraditional students (those who did\nnot enter college within a year of high school) were more likely to feel\nprepared for the workforce than traditional students, 49% to 34%. A pretty big\ndifference.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@Nicholas_Wyman) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wyman-4abb697).

reality (VR) is poised to revolutionize the future of work \u2013 but is\nGen Z equipped for VR skills? We discuss:_**\n\n  * **_The role of VR in the future of work_**\n  * **_Six skills that would benefit Gen Zers succeed in VR_**\n  * **_Insights from the University of Nebraska\u2019s Megan Elliott on VR education_**\n\nA recent [Capgemini study](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/AR-VR-in-Operations1.pdf) that surveyed executives\nfrom more than 700 companies states that 53% of businesses predict that VR\nwill become a mainstream technology in the next three years. If it does, it\nwill require that the workforce develop a specific set of skills that lay the\nfoundation of working with virtual reality.\n\nWith Generation Z entering the workforce in droves, we delve into how it can\nprepare for the future of work marked by the collaboration of storytelling\nwith immersive technologies such as virtual reality, in conversation with\n**Megan Elliott, Director of Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts at\nthe University of Nebraska \u2013 Lincoln**.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Upskilling Strategy 2020 - Is Your Workforce Acquiring\nExtended Reality (XR)\nSkills?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/upskilling-strategy-digital-skills-ar-vr-mr-xr-skills/)\n\n## **What Does the Future of Work for Gen Z Look Like?**\n\nGen Z covers individuals of a broad age group, from 7 years to 22 years of\nage. So, the future of work for this generation is unpredictable and fast-\nevolving, making rapid upskilling vital. Elliott believes in preparing Gen Z\nfor the future of work right from their college days.\n\nElliott tells us in an exclusive, \u201cOur Bachelor of Fine Arts in Emerging Media\nArts allows students to choose two of eight emphases from among Experience\nDesign, Immersive+Interactive Media, Cinematic Arts, Story, Sensory Media,\nVirtual Production, Sonic Arts, and Data+Art. We are equipping our students\nwith the skills they need to thrive in the 21st century,\u201d Elliott comments.\n\nAnd several trends suggest that these skills are shifting towards visual\nstorytelling and immersive experiences:\n\n  * [Upwork\u2019s Skills Index 2019](https://www.upwork.com/press/2019/08/14/q2-2019-skills/) mentions motion graphics and social video marketing among the 20 most in-demand freelance skills for this year. Gen Z would benefit from acquiring such competencies before they enter the workforce.\n  * From broad-based skills, companies are now moving towards platform-specific capabilities. While virtual reality as a discipline was an in-demand skill [according to Upwork in 2017](https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/08/01/q2-2017-skills-index/), this year, the 4K video editing platform, DaVinci Resolve, has taken its place.\n  * This demand isn\u2019t confined to mature technology markets. [PwC reports](https://www.pwc.in/research-insights/2019/fast-forward.html) that VR will be integral to the future of work for Gen Z employees in upcoming markets such as India as well.\n\n  \nTo stay ahead of this evolution curve, students, educators, and corporate\ntrainers must make VR part of their competency suite. This will help upcoming\ngenerations meet the needs of the future of work, ready to fill some of the\nskill gaps that have emerged in recent times.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Future of Virtual Reality in the\nWorkplace**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/the-future-of-virtual-reality-in-the-workplace/)\n\n## **6 Skills Gen Zers Need to Succeed in the Age of VR**\n\nTo face the [future of work](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/future-of-work-key-trends/) with confidence, Gen Zers need a\nunique combination of hard and soft skills. \"I always say we are looking for\nthe 'magicians, pirates, and the wizards.\u2019 We\u2019re looking for the students who\njust like to create \u2013 telling stories, making movies, building apps, creating\nvideo games, building robots, making music, whatever their passions are,\u201d says\nElliott. Let\u2019s look at these skills and traits in closer detail.\n\n### **1\\. A fail-fast, fail-often mindset (soft skill)**\n\nVR professionals will work in a highly dynamic space, with new technologies\nentering the market every day, and expectations/opportunities changing\naccordingly.\n\nFor instance, Elliot tells us that the Carson Center is \"recruiting students\nwith radical imaginations who want to invent the future \u2013 not just in\nentertainment, but in architecture, precision agriculture, wearable\ntechnology, and more. We'll prepare them to do so with the skills to harness\ndisruptive forces like AI and data streaming.\"\n\nThis will help to pick up new skills rapidly, without aiming for absolute\nperfection in VR projects. Employees who can fail fast and fail often are also\nless likely to become complacent with a specific VR or storytelling platform.\n\n### **2\\. The ability to collaborate and lead a team (soft skill)**\n\nAs VR technology matures, projects will become more collaborative, requiring\ninvolvement from multiple stakeholders. One can imagine the creation of\ncollaborative platforms for VR, where highly specialized Gen Z employees come\ntogether to create the final VR product. To succeed in this future of work,\nGen Zers need the ability to collaborate seamlessly.\n\nLeadership will also be an essential skill, as the most innovative/disruptive\nprofessionals find themselves at the helm of game-changing VR projects. \u201cWe\nare looking for smart, creative leaders \u2013 the innovators and entrepreneurs of\nour world,\u201d Elliott adds.\n\n### **3\\. An active imagination with high fidelity (soft skill)**\n\nImagination is the cornerstone of crafting immersive experiences, and this\napplies to VR as well. But being able to imagine an engaging environment isn\u2019t\nenough \u2013 it should carry adequate fidelity to replicate the real world. To\nachieve this, and succeed in the future of work, Gen Z needs powerful\nobservation skills, the ability to find patterns, storytelling skills, and an\ninterest in linking the physical world to digital artifacts. Courses such as\nthose offered by the Carson Center help in the development of such skills.\n\n### **4\\. 3D objects design and simulation (hard skill)**\n\nThis is a basic hard skill that Gen Zers will require in the future. Just like\nmath lays the foundation of STEM, 3D simulation will be a critical building\nblock for VR projects.\n\nSeveral tools out there can help young professionals and students get started\nwith building 3D modeling skills immediately. For example, [Second\nLife](http://secondlife.com/) is a gamified virtual world where users can try\ntheir hand at basic 3D modeling. For more advanced learners and corporate\ntrainers, [Unity](https://unity.com/) is a smarter choice, as it comes\ncomplete with resources and support services.\n\n### **5\\. Mobile-native app and hardware development (hard skill)**\n\nAs VR technology evolves, it will become more user-friendly, delivering\nsuperior experiences to the audience. This means that VR will require\ncompatibility with smartphones.\n\nThat\u2019s why Gen Zers need advanced mobile-native development skills that can\nalign the high-bandwidth, high-quality content of VR with a standard\nsmartphone specification. Hardware skills will also prove valuable to the\nfuture of work, as Gen Zers who can optimize hardware form factors and battery\nlife will be in high demand.\n\n### **6\\. User experience / User interface design (hard skill)**\n\nUX/UI designers have never been in more demand than right now. [According to\nthe Onward Search Digital, Creative and Marketing Professionals Salary\nGuide](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/want-a-career-in-ux/), UX design\nwas 2019\u2019s second-most searched for skill. And this trend is likely to\ncontinue as VR becomes central to the future of work. Gen Zers should be able\nto imagine a user\u2019s journey for a compelling narrative around interactions,\nidentify user problems to be addressed via design, and write code that can\nturn design concepts into reality.\n\n\u201cOur graduates will be fluent in story, design, entrepreneurship, and code \u2013\ncore creative capabilities that give students ownership over their futures and\nallow them to thrive in a fast-changing, diverse, global environment,\u201d\ncomments Elliott.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Connecting the Dots With VR: KPIs to LRS - Three Examples\nof Usage Today**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/connecting-the-dots-with-vr-kpis-to-lrs-three-examples-of-\nusage-today/)\n\n## **VR Will Be at the Heart of Tomorrow\u2019s Workplace \u2013 Are Employers Ready?**\n\nAs VR technology becomes more sophisticated and accessible, processes like\ntraining, collaboration, equipment maintenance, and marketing will be heavily\nimpacted. For example, [VR is already widely used for soft skills\ntraining](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-ar-\nand-vr-are-revolutionizing-soft-skills-training-in-2019/) in areas like\nmanufacturing and hospitality.\n\nIt\u2019s vital to start equipping the Gen Z for this new future of work from an\nearly stage. The University of Nebraska has made significant strides in this\ndirection. \"The Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts recently became\nthe first in the Big Ten to collaborate with Educause and HP in researching\nthe possibilities of XR [extended reality] in higher education,\u201d Elliott tells\nus.\n\nWith 2020 right around the corner, employers must revisit their skill\nrequirements with an eye on a VR-led future. The six skills listed above will\nbe critical for the future workforce, shaping Gen Zers' performance trajectory\nas well as the company's growth path.\n\n_Is Gen Z ready as VR takes over the future of work?

And they\nare definitely on to something.\n\nRecent research on HR and employee engagement has produced compelling evidence\nof the benefits satisfied and engaged workers bring to both their\norganizations and themselves.\n\nJob satisfaction statistics highlight the fact that happy employees really\nmake a difference in any organization. Those who show up at work with an\neagerness to overcome challenges, solve problems, and achieve set goals are\nthe driving force of any business. Unfortunately, at the moment, only a third\nof the US workforce feels this enthusiastic about their job.\n\nThis puts the ball in the employers\u2019 court. They are the ones who can spike\nthese numbers by showing employees they truly care, by rewarding hard work and\ndedication, and by making employee wellness and engagement a priority. To\ndiscover how employee happiness can boost an organization\u2019s productivity and\nto learn how to deploy a winning staff engagement strategy, dive into our list\nof employee satisfaction and engagement statistics.\n\n##  **Key** **Job Satisfaction Statistics** ** - Editor\u2019s Pick**\n\n  * 72% of surveyed professionals say having more work benefits would increase their job satisfaction.\n  * 51% of US workers say they get a sense of identity from their job.\n  * 13% of employed Americans are actively disengaged at work.\n  * 30% of American workers say their job is \u201cjust a job to get them by.\u201d\n  * Only 46% of employees place \u201ca great deal of trust\u201din their employers.\n  * Employees who feel their superiors treat them with respect are 63% more satisfied with their jobs.\n  * 79% of American workers say company culture is an important factor in job satisfaction.\n  * 83% of millennials consider work-life balance to be the most important factor in evaluating a potential job.\n\n### Job Satisfaction Stats\n\n#### 1\\. Employees who feel their superiors treat them with respect are 63%\nmore satisfied with their jobs.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nEmployers who treat their workers respectfully have much to gain and nothing\nto lose. As a recent Harvard Business Review report confirms, when employees\nare respected by their leaders, their job satisfaction levels go up by as much\nas 63%. This, in turn, creates a 55% spike in engagement, while employees\u2019\nfocus heightens by 58%. This work satisfaction report also shows that\nappreciated employees are 110% more likely to stay with their organization.\n\n#### 2\\. 62% of employees in managerial positions report high job satisfaction\nlevels.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nEven though a management role entails a lot of responsibility and is often\nstressful, it comes with a set of perks that make up for it. Top-notch\nhealthcare, paid time off, a retirement savings plan, maternity/paternity\nleave, and professional development programs are some of the core benefits\nthat compensate for the stress and create good work-life balance. Pew\nResearch\u2019s job satisfaction statistics confirm that executives are\nparticularly likely to say they\u2019re \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their jobs, compared\nwith only 48% of those who work in manual or physical labor jobs.\n\n#### 3\\. 72% of surveyed professionals say having more work benefits would\nincrease their job satisfaction.\n\n(Zoro)\n\nThe majority of employees feel that additional benefits would improve their\noverall job satisfaction. Medical insurance paid fully by the company is\ndesired but not received by 58% of respondents, as is fully company-paid\ndental insurance (53%). Employee motivation statistics reveal that other perks\nworkers desire but don\u2019t get include work-from-home/remote days (40%),\nperformance bonuses (35%), transportation allowance (32%), catered meals\n(31%), and student loan reimbursement (29%).\n\n#### 4\\. 61% of employees with an annual family income of less than $30,000\nsay they are \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their family lives, compared with 80% of\nworkers whose family income is $75,000 per year or more.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the perks that matter. A study conducted by Pew Research\nCenter on 5,000 working American adults from all 50 states shows that a higher\nincome is directly related to overall satisfaction and happiness in terms of\nboth professional and family life. Happiness and productivity at work\nstatistics show that eight in 10 adults living in high-income households (with\nan annual income of $75,000 or more) reported being \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with\ntheir family lives, whereas only six in 10 adults from low-income families\n(with an annual income of $30,000 or less) reported the same level of\nsatisfaction.\n\n#### 5\\. 51% of US workers say they get a sense of identity from their job.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nAmericans are divided on whether their job is merely a source of income or a\nmore meaningful aspect of their lives that gives them a sense of identity. The\nsame job satisfaction in the US study indicates a little over half of working\nAmericans find purpose in their work. Another 47% of US employees say their\njob is just what they do for a living, while the remaining 2% hold multiple\njobs and did not answer this question.\n\n#### 6\\. 70% of adults working in education say their job gives them a sense\nof identity.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nSome jobs are just more fulfilling than others. According to career\nsatisfaction statistics, most educators (70%) think their work makes them who\nthey are. Healthcare workers feel the same way, with 62% of them saying their\njob gives them a sense of identity. On the other hand, only 42% of people\nworking in hospitality and just 36% in the retail or wholesale trade identify\nwith their job.\n\n#### 7\\. 79% of American workers say company culture is an important job\nsatisfaction factor.\n\n(Speakap)\n\nWhen asked whether company culture is important to them, almost 80% of US\nprofessionals responded in the affirmative. Not only that: 57% said they would\ntake a job with a competitor if they felt that company\u2019s corporate culture\nwere better than their current company\u2019s. According to Speakap\u2019s company\nculture statistics, respect and fairness, trust and integrity, and teamwork\nare the most important attributes of a strong culture.\n\n#### 8\\. More than 50% of CEOs say corporate culture influences productivity,\ncreativity, profitability, company value, and growth rate.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nAnd while eight in 10 employees consider company culture vital to workplace\nengagement, only five in 10 top managers recognize this. Recruit Loop reveals\nthat a little over half of CEOs surveyed admit the effects of corporate\nculture on how productive and creative workers are, how much revenue the\ncompany generates, and how quickly it grows.\n\n#### 9\\. 58% of US managers say they haven\u2019t received any management training.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nPerhaps the discrepancy between the percentage of workers and executives who\nunderstand the relevance of corporate culture can be accounted for by this\nshocking stat. CareerBuilder\u2019s nationwide survey conducted on 2,480 US\nemployers and 3,910 US workers reveals that nearly 60% of managers get into\nleadership positions without receiving any training for the task. According to\nthese HR statistics, the biggest challenges executives name are dealing with\nissues between co-workers on their team, motivating team members, performance\nreviews, and creating career paths for employees. Basically, all the tasks\nthey find daunting reflect their lack of managerial training.\n\n#### 10\\. 23% of employees describe their leaders\u2019 performance as \u201cpoor\u201d or\n\u201cvery poor.\u201d\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same study found that almost a quarter of US workers rate\ntheir corporate leaders\u2019 performance as \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cvery poor.\u201d CareerBuilder\u2019s\njob satisfaction statistics further explain that employees who are unsatisfied\nwith their superiors think they don\u2019t make an effort to listen to employees or\naddress employee morale. Employees also cite a lack of transparency and honest\ncommunication, major changes made without warning, unreasonable workloads, and\nimpossible productivity demands as reasons for their poor evaluation.\n\n#### 11\\. 30% of American workers say their job is \u201cjust a job to get them\nby.\u201d\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nNearly a third of employed adults in the US work just because they have to.\nThey consider their job neither a career nor a stepping stone to one. Luckily,\nthe number of devoted workers who believe they are on the right path is\nhigher, with 50% of respondents saying they view their job as a career.\nAnother 20% of Americans believe their current job is the starting point that\nwill lead to a career, according to recently published employment satisfaction\nstatistics.\n\n#### 12\\. Only 25% of employees who quit their jobs cite money as the main\nreason for leaving.\n\n(Officevibe)\n\nEven though most employers are blissfully oblivious, with 89% of them thinking\nworkers leave for financial reasons, in reality only 25% of employees abandon\ntheir jobs because of unsatisfactory pay. In fact, it\u2019s usually the employer\nwho chases people away. Officevibe\u2019s turnover statistics show that 75% of\npeople who end up leaving don\u2019t quit their job; they quit their boss.\n\n#### 13\\. Women (44%) are more likely than men (39%) to leave their current\njob for a new one with a flexible work environment.\n\n(Globe Newswire)\n\nWomen, who often need to juggle various responsibilities both at home and in\nthe office, are more interested in a flexible work environment than men.\nAlmost half of female respondents said they would quit their job to go work\nfor a company that permits them to work from home occasionally, with flexible\nworking hours. Men were less interested in this perk - only 39% of them would\njump ship for this reason.\n\n#### 14\\. Men (40%) are more likely to leave their current job for a higher\nposition in a different company than women (30%).\n\n(Globe Newswire)\n\nBetter-ranking positions tend to motivate men more than flexibility. Yoh\u2019s\nworkplace statistics show that male employees often change jobs because of the\nprestige and power associated with executive roles. Their female counterparts\nare less inclined to switch work environments for a high-status position.\n\n#### 15\\. 83% of millennials consider work-life balance to be the most\nimportant factor in evaluating a potential job.\n\n(FlexJobs)\n\nAchieving work-life balance is a priority for a handsome majority of\nmillenials. A whopping 83% of people born between the early eighties and mid-\nnineties assess a potential job on how time-consuming it will be. If they\njudge it will leave little to no free time, millennials won\u2019t accept such a\nposition, as we can see from a range of job satisfaction statistics. When it\ncomes to baby boomers, though, only 62% consider work-life balance a factor\nwhen deciding whether or not to take on a new role.\n\n#### 16\\. More than three-quarters of employees would not accept a better-paid\njob from a company that failed to act against employees who were involved in\nsexual harassment.\n\n(The Manifest)\n\nMore money would not be incentive enough to attract professionals to a company\nwith unethical practices. A 2019 study published by The Manifest shows that\n79% of employees wouldn\u2019t come to work in a firm that neglects to act on\nsexual harassment accusations. Other intolerable practices, as reported in\nthese retention stats, include selling users\u2019 data without their knowledge\n(76%), creating environmental problems (72%), and paying female or minority-\nbackground employees less (71%).\n\n#### 17\\. Workers who say their company provides equal opportunities are\nalmost four times more likely to be proud to work for the company.\n\n(Salesforce)\n\nCreating a workplace where everyone\u2019s voice is heard and all have the same\nchance of getting ahead exclusively based on merit is an excellent way of\nmotivating employees. Working for an equal-opportunity company makes staff 3.8\ntimes more likely to feel proud of their employer and team.\n\n#### 18\\. 42% of employed Americans would change jobs for another that offers\nthe possibility of working remotely, but only 24% would switch jobs for a\nshorter commute.\n\n(Global Newswire)\n\nWork place statistics let know that US employees deem remote work possibility\nmore important than short commute when considering a job change. If offered a\nposition in a different company that would allow them to get things done\nwithout coming into the office, 42% of employed Americans would accept it. A\njob closer to home with reduced commute time would motivate only a quarter of\nUS employees to leave their current job.\n\n#### 19\\. Only 46% of workers have \u201ca great deal of trust\u201d in their bosses.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nA global study that included 9,800 full-time workers aged 19 to 68 from eight\ncountries shows only 46% of workers trust their employers greatly. According\nto Harvard Business Review employee loyalty statistics, 39% of surveyed\nemployees say they have \u201csome trust,\u201d while 15% report \u201cvery little\u201d or \u201cno\ntrust at all.\u201d Employers who want to improve engagement and retention should\nkeep in mind that people believe a high level of trust in their company has a\nmajor influence on them being happier at work, staying at the company, doing\nhigher-quality work, and recommending the company to others.\n\n#### 20\\. 66% of Gen Z workers consider equal opportunity for pay and\npromotion as \u201dvery important\u201d factors that would influence their trust in an\nemployer.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nTo earn the trust of Generation Z, companies need to implement fair practices.\nEmployee satisfaction statistics indicate that two-thirds of employees just\nentering the workforce consider equal advancement opportunities and merit-\nbased salaries \u201cvery important\u201d factors in shaping how much they trust their\nemployer. Learning and advancement opportunities are also very important for\n66% of young workers when deciding whether to trust their companies.\n\n#### 21\\. More than two in five workers have gained weight at their current\njob.\n\n(PR Newswire)\n\nCareer Vision\u2019s corporate wellness statistics reveal that 56% of the nation's\nworkforce believe they are overweight, and 45% believe they've gained weight\nat their present job. When asked what contributed to their weight gain, 51%\nsaid sitting at a desk most of the day, 45% said they were too exhausted from\nwork to exercise, and 38% blamed stress-eating.\n\n#### 22\\. 28% of employees say their company provides gym passes, workout\nfacilities, or wellness benefits, but 63% of employees from this group don't\ntake advantage of those perks.\n\n(PR Newswire)\n\nEmployee engagement statistics indicate that more than a quarter of companies\ntry to keep their workers happy and healthy by providing workout passes.\nDespite this, 63% of people who have access to these wellness benefits do not\nuse them. On the other hand, 64% of workers say their employers do not offer\nsuch perks, but if offered, 42% think they would take advantage of them.\n\n#### 23\\. With a job satisfaction score of 4.6 out of 5, recruiting managers\nreport the highest job satisfaction levels.\n\n(Glasdoor)\n\nA job satisfaction by profession study published by Glassdoor in 2019 reveals\nthat recruiting managers, with a median base salary of $70,000, tend to be\nhappiest at work. Second place is shared by three professions: dental\nhygienists, who make $67,250 annually, sales operations managers ($93,000 per\nyear), and product designers ($100,000 per year). All of these jobs have\nsatisfaction levels of 4.5 out of 5. This data shows that, while money is\nimportant, it isn\u2019t the decisive factor in determining how one feels about\ntheir job.\n\n#### 24\\. 75% of US professionals think new technology is contributing to\ntheir job dissatisfaction.\n\n(The Economic Times)\n\nAs many as three-quarters of American workers believe new technology causes\ndissatisfaction at work, only 20% say tech innovation and new gadgets are\nresponsible for raising their job satisfaction, while 5% are indifferent.\nThese employee dissatisfaction statistics reveal that fear of immediate job\nloss, concern about fewer jobs in the future, and poor workplace ethics are\nthe main reasons for this dissatisfaction.\n\n### Employee Engagement Stats\n\n#### 25\\. Only 34% of US employees are engaged at work.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nBut according to Gallup\u2019s latest employee engagement statistics, the\npercentage of workers who are passionate about their job and feel committed to\ntheir work and their workplace is actually at an all-time high. The American\nanalytics agency started conducting a yearly survey on employee engagement in\n2000. In the nearly two decades since, the percentage of actively disengaged\nworkers has never been lower, either. Employees who feel miserable about their\nwork environment currently make up only 13% of the American workforce.\n\n#### 26\\. 91% of highly engaged employees report being satisfied with their\nprofessional development opportunities.\n\n(Bonusly)\n\nBut why is employee engagement important? Because it creates pleasant\nworkplaces people don\u2019t want to leave. When employees feel like valued team\nmembers whose contribution is recognized and appreciated, they are 87% less\nlikely to leave their job, according to Recruit Loop\u2019s retention statistics.\nThe bottom line is that it makes more sense, financial and otherwise, to\ninvest in keeping high-performance workers than to constantly spend money\nfinding and training new personnel.\n\n#### 27\\. Engaged teams generate 21% more profit than their disengaged\ncounterparts.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nWhen people are satisfied with their job, have good communication with their\nsuperiors and their colleagues, and set clear goals, they are motivated to\nachieve great results. And they often do. According to Gallup\u2019s engagement\nstatistics, teams that work in companies that nurture a high-engagement\nculture reward those companies with higher productivity, better customer\nengagement, better employee retention, and a 21% increase in profitability.\n\n#### 28\\. Employers who increase their workers\u2019 engagement by just 10% can\nboost profits by $2,400 per employee every year.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nRecruit Loop provides more detailed information on the financial rewards\nemployers can reap if they increase worker engagement. Raising staff morale\ncan also boost company profits. Getting employees to care just 10% more about\nthe work they do and their company can bring in $2,400 per employee each year,\naccording to these productivity stats.\n\n#### 29\\. Actively disengaged workers cost the US between $450 billion and\n$550 billion in lost productivity per year.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nKeeping severely disengaged workers - the ones who are so unhappy with their\njob they undermine the achievements of engaged employees on purpose - costs\nAmerican companies a hefty sum each year. In fact, Gallup estimates the\ncombined cost in lost productivity these workers cause amounts to $550 billion\nannually.\n\n#### 30\\. US companies spend $11 billion annually on employee turnover.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nStaff rotation costs are another huge financial burden relating to employee\nengagement. Finding ways to keep workers motivated and truly connected to the\ncompany will ensure they are loyal to their organization. Failing to do this,\nhowever, means constantly having to search for new employees and spending time\nand money training them. Bearing in mind recent employee turnover statistics\nthat reveal American companies allocate as much as $11 billion every year on\nreplacing staff, it\u2019s undoubtedly more profitable to retain existing workers.\n\n#### 31\\. 47% of HR chiefs cite employee retention and turnover as their top\nworkforce-management challenge.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nAs clear as it may be that employee retention is beneficial to any\norganization, HR leaders agree it is the biggest obstacle they encounter while\nmanaging personnel. Nearly half of HR specialists cite retention and turnover\nas the most challenging aspects of their job, followed by recruitment and\nculture management.\n\n#### 32\\. 96% of employees believe showing empathy is an important way of\nimproving employee retention.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nEmployers who care openly about their staff have an excellent shot at earning\ntheir workers\u2019 loyalty, according to Forbes\u2019 employee retention statistics.\nHuman capital is a company\u2019s most valuable asset, so why not show some human\ninterest in your workers? Celebrating important life moments, encouraging\nemployees to use vacation time, providing company gym passes - these are all\nways of showing the people who work for you that you care about them.\n\n#### 33\\. 70% of organizations have adopted values-based employee-recognition\nprograms.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nFostering employee engagement in an organization goes hand-in-hand with\nletting employees know their hard work is noticed and appreciated. Tying these\nrecognition programs with core values of a company is becoming notably popular\namong HR leaders. Why? Because values-based employee-recognition plans reward\nemployees while reinforcing and driving business goals at the same time.\n\n#### 34\\. Employee-recognition programs funded with at least 1% of payroll are\nmore likely to be rated successfully by HR managers than underfunded programs\nor programs with zero budget.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nWorkhuman\u2019s job satisfaction statistics emphasize the importance of investing\nin programs that make employees feel appreciated. HR experts agree that\nunderfunded employee recognition initiatives or initiatives with no budget at\nall give unsatisfactory results. A certain amount of funds - usually at least\n1% of payroll - need to be set aside for these programs to be effective.\n\n#### 35\\. Organizations with ethnically and gender-diverse staff are 21% to\n31% more likely to have financial returns above industry medians.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nWomen and minorities remain underrepresented in many workplaces despite the\nfact that diversity has been proven to improve businesses\u2019 performance. US job\nstatistics recently published by McKinsey bring to light just how big an\neffect diversity has on company revenue. Businesses that are in the top\nquartile for gender diversity are 21% more likely to exceed their industry\nmedian profits. In the case of ethnically diverse teams, the likelihood of\nexceeding median industry revenue goes up by 31%. It makes perfect sense; in\ndiverse teams everybody brings their own perspective to the table,\nstrengthening the company.\n\n#### 36\\. Empowering women and advancing their equality in the workplace could\nadd $12 trillion to the global GDP by 2025.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nMcKinsley\u2019s productivity statistics point to the enormous power of inclusion.\nWorking towards empowering women and engaging them in the workforce around the\nworld would be extremely beneficial to everyone. To put it in financial terms,\nthe global GDP would increase by mind-boggling $12 trillion in the next six\nyears if this goal were achieved.\n\n#### 37\\. A great onboarding experience can lock down 69% of employees for at\nleast three years.\n\n(O.C. Tanner)\n\nOnboarding is the employer\u2019s first chance to shape an engaged worker.\nSuccessfully communicating the company mission, setting clear goals and\nexpectations, providing adequate training and mentorship, and checking in on\neach new employee\u2019s progress are some of the most important ways to retain\nstaff. Employee engagement and retention begin on day one. If done properly,\nthese initial actions can ensure the majority of workers stay with the\norganization for a minimum of three years.\n\n#### 38\\. Up to 20% of employee turnover happens within the first 45 days on\nthe job.\n\n(O.C Tanner)\n\nJust as effective onboarding has the power to lock down new hires for years, a\nmishandled onboarding process can drive new employees away in just 45 days. As\nO.C. Tanner\u2019s employee retention stats show, a fifth of all employee churn\nhappens during this short period of time. Deploying the previously mentioned\ntechniques reduces the likelihood of employee walkout, both at the beginning\nof employment and later on.\n\n#### 39\\. 60% of employers don\u2019t set clear goals for new hires in their first\nyear.\n\n(O.C Tanner)\n\nAlmost two-thirds of employers make the huge mistake of not determining well-\ndefined goals for new hires during their first year on the job. Even though it\nmay seem sensible not to put too much pressure on new team members and give\nthem time to learn the ropes, it is detrimental for the organization not to\nset clear targets for the first year on the job. According to employee\nengagement data, if workers don\u2019t see management taking interest in their\nresults, monitoring them, and providing constructive feedback, they can easily\nbecome disengaged.\n\n#### 40\\. 86% of both employees and executives cite a lack of collaboration\nand ineffective communication as the main reason for workplace failures.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nEmployees and their bosses are on the same page when it comes to pinning down\nthe reasons for workplace failures. The large majority of all workers think\nclearer communication and more collaboration would lead to better results, but\nonly 18% of employees are evaluated on communication in their performance\nreviews.\n\n#### 41\\. When employees take part in special projects, they are 50% more\nlikely to learn new and valuable skills that help with their current roles.\n\n(O.C. Tanner)\n\nO.C. Tanner\u2019s recently published employee development statistics point to the\nimportance of involving employees in projects that go beyond their everyday\ntasks. Constantly focusing on just a few assignments kills workers\u2019\nmotivation. So, when a new project arises, make sure to include not just the\nemployees who can contribute, but also those who can learn from it.\n\n#### 42\\. For every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-\nexecutive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) go up by 0.8%.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nPeople from different backgrounds have different perspectives. Thanks to their\nunique set of previous experiences, they view problems from a range of angles\nand come up with different solutions. When people with different outlooks\nbounce ideas off of each other, they think of better solutions than like-\nminded people from the same culture. As McKinsey\u2019s employee engagement\nstatistics show, executive teams composed of ethnically and racially diverse\nmembers generate higher earnings.\n\n#### 43\\. Nine in 10 HR leaders agree that ongoing peer feedback and check-ins\nhave a positive impact on their organizations.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nRegularly checking in on employees\u2019 progress, results and issues they face\nhelps organizations a great deal. This practice gives managers a chance to\nguide workers in the right direction at the right time. Instead of employees\nfeeling stuck and abandoned with a task, regular check-ins ensure problems are\ntackled by both the staff and their leaders. This system, paired with ongoing\npeer feedback, is among the top employee engagement and retention strategies\nof 89% of HR experts.\n\n#### 44\\. 80% of HR managers say there is an employee-recognition program in\ntheir organizations.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nHR managers agree that their employee-recognition programs contribute to a\npositive employee experience (89%), good employee relationships (86%),\norganizational culture (85%), employee engagement (84%), and organizational\nvalues (83%). Keeping in mind all these benefits, HR leaders recommend\ntreating employee recognition as more than just a program. They believe it\nshould be a management practice with a real and measurable business impact,\naccording to Workhuman\u2019s HR and employee engagement statistics.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### What is job satisfaction?\n\nJob satisfaction, as the name indicates, refers to the level of fulfilment an\nemployee gets from their job and work environment. When workers are satisfied,\nthey are self-motivated, content, and productive. They show up to work ready\nto face new challenges. Companies whose workers feel highly satisfied with\ntheir job outperform their competition. Innovation and great results happen\nwhen workers feel respected and valued at work.\n\n#### How to keep employees engaged?\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to employee engagement. Clearly defined\ngoals and expectations, ongoing feedback from peers and superiors alike, open\ncommunication, employee recognition programs, internal career development\nprograms, competitive benefits, positive corporate culture, and flexible work\nenvironment are among the best employment engagement strategies.\n\n#### Why employees quit statistics?\n\nPeople quit for various reasons, but according to 2019 data from Statista, a\nquarter of Americans cite better pay as the main reason for leaving a company.\nThe second-most common reason is dissatisfaction with their current\norganization (16%), followed by workers who are looking for companies with\nvalues more similar to their own (14%). Relocation (11%) and changing part-\ntime gigs for full-time jobs round up the top-five list of reasons why US\nworkers change employers.\n\n#### What percentage of employees are engaged?\n\nThe latest statistics on employee engagement published by Gallup in 2018 show\nthat the percentage of engaged workers has never been higher. But with only\n34% of workers describing themselves as engaged, there\u2019s still a long way to\ngo before America reaches its full productivity and engagement potential.\n\n#### How many employees are disengaged?\n\nWhile a little over a third of employed Americans identify as \u201cactively\nengaged\u201d at work, 53% of them say they are \u2018not engaged\u2019. Workers from this\ngroup are generally satisfied with their job but say they lack an emotional\nand cognitive connection with their work environment. Employee disengagement\nstatistics show that 13% of workers are \u201cactively disengaged,\u201d meaning they\nare very discontent with their job, so much so they actively undercut the work\ntheir engaged coworkers do.\n\n#### What are the benefits of employee engagement?\n\nThe benefits flow thick and fast when for both workers and corporations when\nstaff members are engaged. Appreciating the human capital of a company leads\nto higher job satisfaction rates as well as improved employment retention\nrates. When employees are engaged at work they tend to have fewer accidents\nand miss work less. Engaged personnel generate more revenue, provide better\ncustomer service, makes more sales, and create more profitable organizations.\nAlso, engaged and satisfied employees achieve a better work-life balance and\nare healthier.\n\n#### How many people like their job?\n\nRelying on the latest data from Statista and Gallup, we\u2019ve calculated that\nthere are approximately 44.5 million full-time workers in the US who love\ntheir job. According to a Statista report published in June 2019, the number\nof full-time workers in the US amounts to 131 million. Gallup\u2019s latest annual\nsurvey suggests 34% of working Americans are fully engaged - happy and\ncommitted - at work. Therefore, the number of people who love their job is a\nlittle over 44.5 million.\n\n#### How many Americans hate their job?\n\nBasing our estimates on the previously mentioned statistics about jobs, we\nreached a number of some 17 million US employees who hate their job. Let\u2019s\nconsider that the 13% of actively disengaged workers from Gallup\u2019s yearly\nemployee engagement study hate their job. From that, we calculated 13% of\nStatista\u2019s data on the number of US employees who hold full-time positions.\nAccording to this data, more than 17 million Americans are miserable at work.\n\n### Happy Employees = Productive Company\n\nAs our list of job satisfaction statistics reiterates, companies do very well\nwhen their employees are happy at work. Engaged employees are likely to feel\ngreat about their job, achieve better results, have a good work-life balance,\nand feel appreciated. All these positive feelings they generate spill over\ninto the company\u2019s performance, resulting in higher productivity and more\nrevenue.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already doing so, you should start expressing appreciation for\nyour employees immediately. After all, they are your business\u2019s most valuable\nasset.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n  1.

Fair Grove Elementary School is the only school in the\ndistrict that received a D grade and did not meet growth expectations.\n\n  \n\nAshley Barr, principal of Fair Grove Elementary, presented the school board\nwith the schools' improvement plan.\n\n  \n\nShe said in this plan there is a placed emphasis on increasing proficiency on\nend-of-grade testing and reading. Barr said some of the strategies to reach\nthis goal include data-based instructional planning; social-emotional learning\nand support; communication with parents; support of transitions from grade to\ngrade; professional development and reading specialist support.\n\n  \n\nSchool board member Kristie Bonnet stated the three schools identified as low\npreforming last year had improved both their performance and growth when given\nsupport by the school district.\n\n  \n\n\"Every one of these schools have pulled up within a year when we have given\nthem the support that they need,\" Bonnett said. \"So instead of looking at this\nas a negative, we have identified their weaknesses and we have worked with\nthem to help bring them up\u2026You can't make anyone a success if you don't know\nwhere the weaknesses are.\"\n\n  \n\nAlso during the meeting, the school board approved a memorandum of agreement\nwith local law enforcement to create a public safety program for the district\nin the spring of 2020.\n\n  \n\nLeeAnn Tuttle-Thomas, director of CTE instruction for Davidson County Schools,\nsaid the initial academies will be located at North Davidson and Central\nDavidson high schools.\n\n  \n\nDavidson County Board of Education Chairman Alan Beck questioned how the\nprogram can be expanded to other schools. He said that he had brought up the\nidea of a public safety academy several years ago for South Davidson High\nSchool and he was disappointed the school was not selected as a host site.\n\n  \n\nDeena Coley, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, told Beck\nthat the proximity of training facilities at Midway and Southmont fire\ndepartments and equipment required by the state to offer the program was a\nmajor factor in the decision to the schools as the initial locations.\n\n  \n\nTuttle-Thomas said the purpose of the safety academy is to guide interested\nstudents toward a career in public safety through a series of courses that\nfocus on academics and on-site training.\n\n  \n\n\"We are preparing our students to be work ready with certification within the\npublic safety academy,\" Tuttle-Thomas said. \"They can walk out (at graduation)\nand have employment. Therefore, it gives us the opportunity to close workforce\ngaps in those fields. ... As we have been meeting over this past year, what we\nhave found out is there is definitely a need and we want to help meet that\nneed.\"\n\n  \n\nMidway Fire Deputy Chief Zach Medlin and Davidson County Sheriff Richie\nSimmons addressed the board and said they were glad to be able to partner with\nDavidson County Schools.\n\n  \n\nMedlin said the local fire departments are committed to providing equipment\nand training for the public safety academies. He said he believes that a\npublic safety academy will provide guidance and opportunity for students.\n\n  \n\nSimmons said he hopes the new public safety academy can help students by\ngiving them goals while at the same time getting more of them interested in\nlaw enforcement and emergency services.\n\n  \n\n\"If you don't fan the flames for these kids, they will never start a fire or a\nspark, no pun intended,\" Simmons said. \"I have required our (schools resource\nofficers) to be more than just protection and to use our crime prevention\nprogram to advise and give technical advice in the law enforcement realm.\nHopefully it will be a great recruiting tool for us; it is a difficult thing\nto get people to go into the public sector.\"\n\n  \n\nSharon Myers can be reached at (336) 249-3981, ext. 228, or sharon.myers@the-\ndispatch.com\n\n## Never miss a story\n\nChoose the plan that's right for you.  \nDigital access or digital and print delivery.\n\n[Subscribe Now](https://www.the-dispatch.com/subscribenow?g2i_source=the-\ndispatch.com&g2i_medium=subscribe&g2i_campaign=footer)\n\n## Sign up for daily e-mails\n\n#### Reader Services __\n\n  * [Support Local Businesses](https://supportlocal.usatoday.com)\n  * [My Profile](http://myprofile.the-dispatch.com/page.aspx?QS=c76003443ff9837d08393c4559ff8a1b86d1a2da672edbd7&PROD_CODE=INKA_DIS)\n  * [Subscribe Now](http://subscribe.the-dispatch.com/)\n  * [Manage Print Account](https://ssl.subscribehome.com/cgi-bin/cmo_wilmington.sh/custservice/web/registration.html?siteid=dis)\n  * [Manage Digital Account](http://subscribe.the-dispatch.com/)\n  * [FAQs](https://www.the-dispatch.com/news/99999999/help)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.the-dispatch.com/contact)\n\n#### Submissions __\n\n  * [News Tips](https://www.the-dispatch.com/news/99999999/help)\n  * [Letters to the Editor](https://www.the-dispatch.com/news/99999999/help)\n  * [Calendar Events](https://www.the-dispatch.com/news/99999999/help)\n  * [Obituaries](https://www.the-dispatch.com/obituaries)\n  * [Legal Notices](http://marketplace.the-dispatch.com/classifieds)\n\n#### Advertising __\n\n  * [Advertise With Us](http://mediakit.gatehousemedia.com/Lexington_NC)\n  * [Place an Ad](https://www.the-dispatch.com/place-ad)\n  * [Classified Ads](http://marketplace.the-dispatch.com/classifieds/)\n  * [Pay Your Ad Bill](https://www.the-dispatch.com/pay-your-ad-bill)\n\n#### Online Services __\n\n  * [Newsletters](http://myprofile.the-dispatch.com)\n  * [Text Alerts](http://newsletter.the-dispatch.com/)\n  * [RSS Feeds](https://www.the-dispatch.com/section/feed)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lexdispatch)\n\n(C) Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.

It has a strong value\nproposition that makes it worth considering against even the best laptops.\n\n####  For\n\n  * Incredibly light \n  * Bright display \n  * Crisp speakers \n  * \n\n####  Against\n\n  * Middling battery life \n  * Flimsy screen \n  * Somewhat cheap feel \n  * \n\n  * [ Intro, availability, design and display ](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-swift-5)\n  * [ Performance, battery life, features and verdict ](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-swift-5/2)\n\n____\n\nAcer\u2019s Swift 5 is a productivity-oriented, ultra-light laptop, and the latest\nmodel introduces a 15.6-inch screen to the series. The laptop\u2019s form factor\nand weight are offset by higher performance internals that make for a capable\nlaptop that compares to the likes of the LG Gram.\n\nA stylish design with some premium flair sets the Acer Swift 5 up to run\nagainst other premium Ultrabooks. And, while the overall value may not be as\nhigh as some of its competition, it costs less than a lot of those laptops as\nwell.\n\n![Acer Swift 5](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n##### Spec sheet\n\nHere is the Acer Swift 5 configuration sent to TechRadar for review:\n\n **CPU:** 1.6GHz Intel Core i5-8265U (quad-core, 6MB cache, up to 3.9GHz)  \n**Graphics:** Intel UHD Graphics 620  \n**RAM:** 8GB DDR4 (2,400MHz)  \n**Screen:** 15.6-inch, 1080p (1,920 x 1,080, IPS, 300 nits, 100% sRGB, 16:9\naspect) touch  \n**Storage:** 256GB PCIe SSD  \n**Ports:** 2 x USB-A 3.0, 1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 2, HDMI, headset jack  \n**Connectivity:** 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5  \n**Camera:** HD (720p, 0.9MP) webcam  \n**Weight:** 2.2 pounds (1kg)  \n**Size:** 14.1 x 9.1 x 0.6 inches (358.1 x 231.1 x 15.2mm; W x D x H)\n\n## Price and availability\n\nThe Acer Swift 5 is available now in the US in two configurations \u2013 we\u2019re\nstill waiting on availability in the UK and Australia. They are available for\n$999 (about \u00a3775, AU$1,420) on the low end and $1,399 (about \u00a31,080, AU$1,990)\non the high end. The difference between the two models comes down to the\nprocessors, RAM and storage inside.\n\nThe cheaper model includes an Intel Core i5-8265U quad-core processor (CPU)\nwith 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), while the more expensive\nmodel upgrades the CPU to the Core i7-8565U and doubles the memory (RAM) and\nstorage.\n\nImage 1 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 2 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 3 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 4 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 5 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 6 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 7 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 8 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 9 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage 10 of 10\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n##  Design and display\n\nThe 15-inch Acer Swift 5 goes for a classy aesthetic in most regards, but\nthere are a few areas where it sneaks a little more budget-like style under\nthe radar.\n\nThe chassis is largely metal, made from a combination of magnesium-lithium and\nmagnesium-aluminum alloys that keep the laptop light, and give it that premium\nmetal look. However, to the touch, these metals don\u2019t feel quite as 'metal\u2019 as\nthe straight aluminum bodies.\n\nThe chassis ends up feeling almost like a stiff plastic, and not the _most_\nstiff one at that. The area below the keyboard can flex under a little\npressure, and the thin display flexes too easily.\n\nThe tradeoff is that this is very light metal. The total weight of the Acer\nSwift 5 is under 1kg. It\u2019s not much strain to pick up the whole laptop by just\nthe corner of the chassis, and slipping it into our backpack makes almost no\ndiscernible difference to the weight on our back. The wall charger is barely\nbigger than a smartphone's and just serves to round out the portability of the\nSwift 5.\n\nWhile some 15-inch laptops have full-size keyboards, the trimmed-down design\nof the Acer Swift 5 leaves it with a tenkeyless design. The keyboard is fully\nbacklit with a simple white glow.\n\nThere are no varying light levels, but the light does illuminate all of the\nlegends on each key. Whether it\u2019s a letter, a number, a special function or\nmedia control, it gets backlit. The way the light illuminates the legends\nisn\u2019t consistent though, and some sections appear slightly dim and a quick pop\nthat\u2019s typical of low-profile, membrane keyboards. We don\u2019t notice any glaring\nfaults, so we\u2019d say it\u2019s a serviceable option, but we don\u2019t notice anything\nthat makes us think compared to others.\n\n![Acer Swift 5](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nThe keyboard is nothing to get excited about. The keys do feel consistent,\nwith light resistance \"wow, that feels amazing.\"\n\nBelow the keyboard, there\u2019s a thin fingerprint scanner that works with Windows\nHello for biometric login, and a simple trackpad that looks and feels similar\nto the chassis of the laptop. It\u2019s smooth to touch and pleasant feeling, but\nthe trackpad has a noticeable quirk.\n\nResting one finger on it to be ready to click while moving the pointer around\nwith the other finger moving the mouse results in a jumpy cursor. This lack of\nwhat\u2019s widely known as \"palm rejection\" can make it difficult to accurately\nplace the cursor in specific spots, such as on buttons or between letters\nwhile editing text. It\u2019s a minor hurdle, but comes up enough when doing a lot\nof text work or just trying to close tabs quickly that we notice it.\n\nAll of the ports for the Swift 5 are located on the sides. The power connector\nis on the left, and feels a tad wobbly, like it\u2019s not the most snug fit.\nHowever, the cable stays solidly plugged in. The left side also has two USB\n3.0 Type-A ports and one Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 port. There\u2019s also a full-size\nHDMI port on the side \u2013 but, it couldn\u2019t run a 1440p monitor at higher than\n60Hz.\n\nOn the right side, there\u2019s a slot for a lock and a headphone jack. Now, a\nheadphone jack on the right side of the computer may not seem like much of an\nissue until you consider how many headphones have the cable stemming from the\nleft headphone. Short headphone cables get in the way easily.\n\nThe screen is a standout portion of the Acer Swift 5. It\u2019s a full 15.6 inches\ndiagonally despite the computers smaller body, and the bezels are fairly slim.\nThe display is a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS panel with a straightforward 16:9\naspect ratio. At a peak of 300 nits, it\u2019s dazzling bright, and out on a porch\non a sunny day, we can see what we were doing clearly. It\u2019s not perfectly\nclear in full sunlight, but the display is usable. With 100% coverage of the\nsRGB color space, the panel can accurately reflect colors for web design\npurposes.\n\nThe bezels around the display are a rubberized plastic, which is one spot Acer\nseems to have skimped, but it\u2019s easy to miss because the screen is so bright\nand the bezels slim at 5.87mm.\n\nWe turned on high dynamic range (HDR) in Windows settings, and though we\nenjoyed impressive visuals in most content, it was hard to say we were getting\ntrue HDR in content. Guardians of the Galaxy looks beautiful on this display,\nfor example, but doesn\u2019t appear to feature any HDR encoding that we know of.\n\nMeanwhile, streaming Star Wars: The Last Jedi, we can see obvious color\nbanding between shades of red in the epic lightsaber battle with Kylo Ren and\nRey. The same goes for the blacks of space. That may very well be the fault of\nNetflix, but the Acer display and Windows HDR settings don\u2019t perform any magic\ntricks.\n\nStill, for entertainment and work, the screen does an impeccable job. The\nhinge is firm as well, which makes using the touchscreen easy.\n\n  * Images Credit: TechRadar\n\n  * 1 \n  * [2](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-swift-5/2)\n\nCurrent page: Intro, availability, design and display\n\n[ Next Page Performance, battery life, features and verdict\n](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-swift-5/2)\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

No one comes\ninto education with the will to do a bad job. Despite this, the gap between\nwhere we are in education and where we need to be (in order to make our\nstudents life-ready and work-ready) is widening much faster than our schools\nare changing. Technology is drastically transforming how we live and work:\neducators, therefore, must manage any risks associated with these new\ntechnologies.\n\n* * *\n\n **You might also like:[Marking aids top score on teachers\u2019 edtech wish list,\nfinds Bett](https://edtechnology.co.uk/dashboard2/Article/marking-aids-top-\nscore-on-teachers-edtech-wish-list/)**\n\n* * *\n\nWith more than 32,000 schools in the UK looking after more than 10 million\npupils, this is a massive undertaking. Unfortunately, teaching shortages and\never-increasing workloads mean that there appears to be no time for these\nimportant ethical discussions.\n\nWe educators have become passive consumers of recommended technologies, with\ninsufficient thought being given to their ethical application.\n\nThis is worrying, because any new technology can be used for both positive and\nnegative applications.\n\n **Q.** **What, if any, policy changes would you like to see in education this\nyear?**\n\nThe future of education is about access, so I\u2019d hope to see something done\nabout finance and infrastructure. Currently, teachers are put off from using\ntechnology when, for example, the network is slow. In addition, when devices\ndon\u2019t work instantly, engagement by both the teacher and student is hindered.\nThe cloud offers huge potential to collaborate, and to break free from the\nconfines of the classroom. This, however, relies on schools having the\nappropriate infrastructure, tech support, appropriate professional development\nand necessary budgets to be able to embrace new technologies with the right\nconsideration.\n\n>  _The future of education is about access, so I\u2019d hope to see something done\n> about finance and infrastructure._\n\n **Q.** **If you could pinpoint one area of improvement for the education\nsector during 2020, what would it be?**\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough: workload, workload, workload! The unmanageable\nvolume of planning, marking, administrative duties, and non-teaching tasks is\nhighlighted so often \u2013 and yet merely paid lip service, never properly\ntackled. Artificial intelligence could, I believe, have a massive impact here,\nfreeing us up from the drudgery of iterative assessment activities, as well as\neradicating the need for SATs and league tables. However, for this to work we\nneed a far more holistic approach to educating future generations, rather than\na mere bolt-on to our current system.\n\nIf we are to shake off our current bolt-on educational system, the greatest\nchallenge for 2020 is to go back to basics and debate openly what education\nis, what it\u2019s for, and where it should happen. It is imperative that this is\ndone collaboratively, and not in silos. The complexity of this task is vast,\nespecially as we interact with more intelligent environments.\n\nPerhaps the starting point for us all is to clarify our understanding of\nintelligence, in order to think more about the aims of a 21st-century\neducation system. Professor Rose Luckin, in her book Machine Learning and\nHuman Intelligence, shines a light in this area. I think this is important\nbecause schools are picking up on the discussion of intelligence, and this\nwill give them a starting point.\n\nTechnology is a major driver for change, and is developing much faster than\nmost of us can keep up with. It offers the promise of so much to so many, in\nincreasingly shorter timeframes: and education is no exception. Faster\nprocessing powers, for example, open up new experiences in both virtual and\nimmersive worlds. Student identities could be tied more to biometrics, which\nwould make personal data more secure. And artificial intelligence has the\npower to reduce a teacher\u2019s workload with a whole manner of iterative tasks.\n\n* * *\n\n **You might also like:[Bett 2020: creating a better future by transforming\neducation](https://edtechnology.co.uk/dashboard2/Article/bett-2020-creati\u2026orming-\neducation/)**\n\n* * *\n\nThe positive impact of all these developments will only be felt, however, if\neducators have time to better prepare ourselves for these transformations.

The country is home to\nsome of the world\u2019s most renowned academics, who consistently produce high-\nquality research that has an impact on society. Lecturers are engaging and\ninnovative in their teaching. And scholars are constantly forging partnerships\nwith global peers to ensure they are up to speed on the latest developments in\ntheir field.\n\nBut when it comes to graduate employability, the UK\u2019s dominance is less\ncertain. The [Global Employability University\nRanking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/carousels/global-employability-\nuniversity-ranking-2015-results), published today, suggests that recruiters\nare increasingly turning away from UK institutions when choosing the\nuniversities from which they hire graduates.\n\nThe UK has 12 universities in the top 150 list, down from [13 last\nyear](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/global-employability-\nuniversity-ranking-2014-results/2017406.article). Of those, seven have fallen,\nfour have gained places and one has remained static, leading to a net loss of\n36 places.\n\nUniversity College London falls 16 places to 30th, for instance, while [King\u2019s\nCollege London](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/kings-college-london) declines eight places to 43rd. There is also\ndownward movement outside the capital. The [University of\nNottingham](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/university-nottingham) drops 15 places to 78th and the [University of\nBirmingham](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/university-birmingham) plummets 20 spots to 80th.\n\nSo what is the reason for the UK\u2019s decline? One possible factor is that UK\ninstitutions\u2019 links with industry are not as strong as those of their\ncounterparts elsewhere. For [my\nfeature](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/employability-which-\nuniversity-is-doing-the-best-by-its-students) on the results of the ranking, I\nspoke to several institutions that consider strong relationships with\nemployers to be a core part of their remit. Many of their courses include\nmandatory internships or extensive projects with industry that are integrated\ninto the curriculum.\n\nAnother concern that has been raised is that UK universities that do offer\nwork placements do not always provide the right kinds of opportunities. As\nDavid Docherty, chief executive of the UK\u2019s National Centre for Universities\nand Business, told me: \u201cThe irony is that there are more placements being\noffered by universities than students taking them.\u201d\n\nEmployers based in the UK are less likely than their global peers to believe\nthat only universities able to establish links with companies can promote\nemployability, according to the survey.\n\nDespite that, the demand from employers is clear. When recruiters in the UK\nwere asked which criteria they base their university selection on, the most\npopular response was links with companies, followed by expertise in one field\nof competency and the production of ready-to-work graduates. Laurent\nDupasquier, associate director of [Emerging](http://emerging.fr/), the French\nhuman resources consultancy that commissioned the survey and ranking, says\nthat as the higher education market becomes increasingly globalised,\n\u201creputation plays less of a role and expertise [plays] more\u201d.\n\nThere is no doubt that graduate employability is at the forefront of the minds\nof vice-chancellors across the UK, as high tuition fees and fierce competition\nfor graduate jobs mean they are regularly required to justify the cost of a\ndegree.\n\nBut this survey also reminds us that UK university leaders cannot rely solely\non existing reputation in their drive to attract students and must prove that\nthey can produce graduates who are ready for work.\n\n_[ellie.bothwell@tesglobal.com](mailto:ellie.bothwell@tesglobal.com)_\n\n**[Read the feature on the Global Employability University\nSurvey](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/employability-which-\nuniversity-is-doing-the-best-by-its-students)**\n\n**[View the full Global Employability University\nRanking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/carousels/global-employability-\nuniversity-ranking-2015-results)**\n\nRead more about\n\nRead more about:\n\n[Employability](/policy/employability)\n\n[Employment](/policy/employment)\n\n[Graduate employment](/policy/graduate-employment)\n\nRead more\n\n### [Employability: which university is doing the best by its\nstudents?](/features/employability-which-university-is-doing-the-best-by-its-\nstudents)\n\n## Please [login](/the_user/login/nojs) or [register](/multistep-\nregister/ajax/welcome) to read this article.\n\n### Register to continue\n\n**Get a month's unlimited access to THE content online.** Just register and\ncomplete your career summary.\n\nRegistration is free and only takes a moment.

Equitable\n\nJanuary 29, 2020 |  :\n\nby [Sara Weissman](https://diverseeducation.com/article/author/sweissman/\n\"Posts by Sara Weissman\")  \n  \n\n![Print Friendly, PDF &\nEmail](https://cdn.printfriendly.com/icons/printfriendly-icon-lg.png)Print\n\nA lot of students work to pay for college - more than 80% of part-time\nstudents and over 40% of full-time students, according to [U.S. government\ndata](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_ssa.pdf). A popular option is\nwork-study programs, that is, jobs on campus offered as part of a financial\naid package. The problem is work-study jobs often involve little professional\ndevelopment to help students prepare for careers. Unpaid internships\nfrequently do, but they don't pay the bills.\n\nWhat if work-study wasn\u2019t just about paying for college? What if it was a more\nintentional part of a student\u2019s\neducation?[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images-\ndiverse/uploads/2020/01/29171706/library-922998_640-1-300x199.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images-\ndiverse/uploads/2020/01/29171706/library-922998_640-1.jpg)\n\nColleges and universities are increasingly asking themselves these questions.\nAnd as a result, they have developed some innovative models to make on-campus\nemployment a path to post-graduation jobs.\n\nA number of schools have been engaged in this process for years.\n\nThe University of Iowa, for example, started Iowa GROW, or Iowa Guided\nReflection on Work, in 2009. The program requires student employees to have\nguided conversations with their supervisors about how the skills they\u2019re\nlearning at work and in the classroom can inform each other.\n\nNorthern Arizona University has partnerships with employers like the U.S.\nForest Service, the Museum of Northern Arizona, America Reads and others,\nwhich provide jobs for students with federal work-study.\n\nFive years ago, Clemson University started a program called the University\nProfessional Internship/Co-op Program, focused on paid, on-campus internships\nwith professional development and hands-on mentorship from university staff.\n\nMaking paid internships available on campus helps those students who might\notherwise struggle to get those opportunities, said Dr. Caren Kelley-Hall,\nassociate director of the Clemson program.\n\nFor example, some internships have GPA requirements, which Kelley-Hall said\ncan be a barrier for first-generation students getting acquainted with the\ndemands of college without parental guidance. Clemson's program tries to give\nstudents meaningful work experience with a focus on learning transferable\nskills. If it helps them pay for college, all the better.\n\n\u201cWe aim to have something for every student,\u201d Kelley-Hall said. Clemson tries\nto provide internships in information technology, marketing and a lot of other\ndifferent disciplines. As a part of the program, some engineering student\ninterns even went to Haiti to work on post-earthquake infrastructure.\n\nUnder their supervisors, students aren\u2019t \u201crunning to get them coffee or file\npapers,\u201d Kelley-Hall said. The internships are designed with the intention of\nbeing students' \u201cstepping stone\u201d to jobs in the workforce.\n\nInspired by universities like Clemson, Bennington College has become a recent\naddition to the growing number of colleges and universities scrutinizing work-\nstudy. In 2017, the small Vermont liberal arts school received a grant from\nthe Lumina Foundation to convene a group of institutions to discuss the equity\nand the educational potential of work-study or work-integrated learning.\nFollowing that meeting, Bennington decided to make changes to its own work-\nstudy program.\n\nToo often, work-study is treated like it\u2019s \u201ctransactional,\u201d said Dr. Isabel\nRoche, interim president of Bennington College. But it shouldn't be just about\nthe money. It should also provide students future-oriented skills, she said.\n\nNow, Bennington's student employees \u2013 who start off working in dining, IT, the\nlibrary and the gym \u2013 are paid to go to professional development workshops so\nthey have structured opportunities to reflect on the skills they\u2019re learning\nat work with trained mentors. The school has also streamlined the work-study\nprocess, reducing stress by automatically assigning jobs to first-year\nstudents with work-study in their financial aid packages.\n\n\u201cThis kind of work gives students opportunities to process and build the\nskills that they need in whatever career that they go into,\u201d Roche said. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think we can underestimate the value of those work-ready skills\u2026what it\nmeans to be on time, to be present, to understand and decode the culture of\nwhatever work environment you\u2019re in, whether it\u2019s the dining hall, the library\nor something external.\u201d\n\nFaith McClellan, associate dean of work-integrated learning at Bennington,\nsaid reforming work-study is a diversity and equity issue as well. Low-income\nstudents often can\u2019t afford to do unpaid internships that offer professional\ntraining, she found. But work-study \u2013 programs predominantly made up of low-\nincome students \u2013 can ideally bridge that gap.\n\n\u201cRather than reinforcing these inequalities, we were using campus employment\nas a way to dismantle them,\u201d McClellan said.\n\nBoth Bennington and Clemson reported higher retention rates after they tweaked\ncampus employment models.\n\nFor other colleges and universities looking to make work-study more\neducational and equitable, Bennington's Roche has some \u201cvery straightforward\u201d\nadvice. These programs, she said, need to be \u201cthinking about the work that\nstudents are doing on campus as learning, recognizing that work as learning,\nthen finding real significant ways to acknowledge and recognize that, so\nstudents can benefit both during their time at that school and thereafter.\u201d\n\n_Sara Weissman can be reached at sweissman@diverseeducation.com._\n\n**Semantic Tags:** [Bennington\nCollege](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/bennington-college/) \u2022\n[Clemson University](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/clemson-\nuniversity/) \u2022 [Dr. Caren Kelley-\nHall](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/dr-caren-kelley-hall/) \u2022 [Dr.\nIsabel Roche](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/dr-isabel-roche/) \u2022\n[Faith McClellan](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/faith-mcclellan/) \u2022\n[Low-Income Students](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/low-income-\nstudents/) \u2022 [Lumina\nFoundation](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/lumina-foundation/) \u2022\n[Work Study](https://diverseeducation.com/article/tag/work-study/)  \n\n###  [ ![](http://www.diverseeducation.com/images/DJOBS-LOGO.png)\n](https://diversejobs.net/)\n\n                    \n**       **\n\n[Find Jobs](https://diversejobs.net \"Find Jobs\")\n\n[Post Jobs](https://494.careersite.com/employer/emplogin.html \"Post Jobs\")\n\n**Employers:** [Register (Web-\nOnly)](https://494.careersite.com/employer/emplogin.html \"Register\") | [Print\nAds](https://diverseeducation.com/media-kit/print-ad-rates/ \"Print Ads\")\n\n**Featured Employer**\n\n[  \nView Employer Profiles](https://diversejobs.net/companies/ \"View Employer\nProfiles\") **[www.diversejobs.net](http://diversejobs.net \"Diverse Jobs\")**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Featured Jobs >>\n\n[ Associate Dean for Academic Affairs\n](https://diversejobs.net/posting/associate-dean-for-academic-\naffairs/AE115-3X1E/\n\n) University of Illinois at Chicago\n\n* * *\n\n[ Dean of STEM](https://diversejobs.net/posting/dean-of-stem/AE125-5BXQ/\n\n) Thomas Nelson Community College\n\n* * *\n\n[ Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs\n](https://diversejobs.net/posting/executive-vice-chancellor-for-academic-\naffairs/AE125-5BXM/) University of Texas System\n\n* * *\n\n[ Vice President for Advancement ](https://diversejobs.net/posting/vice-\npresident-for-advancement-/AE125-5BXO/) Kalamazoo College\n\n* * *\n\n[ Associate University Librarian and Director\n](https://diversejobs.net/posting/associate-university-librarian-and-\ndirector-/AE125-5BXN/) Philadelphia, PA\n\n* * *\n\n[ Legal Scholars Program Director ](https://diversejobs.net/posting/legal-\nscholars-program-director/AE125-5BW3/) NAACP Legal Defense and Educational\nFund, Inc\n\n* * *\n\n###  Upcoming _Diverse_ Issues\n\n****COVID-19****  \nIssue Date: 04/30/2020  \nAd Deadline Date: 04/09/2020  \n  \n**[APAHM / MPPW in Community\nColleges](https://responses.diverseeducation.com/2020mppwcc_apahm)**  \nIssue Date: 05/14/2020  \nAd Deadline Date: 04/23/2020  \n  \n[Advertise with Us](https://diverseeducation.com/media-kit/)\n\n  \n\n## Diverse Poll\n\n[view poll](https://www.esurveyspro.com/app/polls/DirectPoll.aspx?id=61286)\n[online survey software](https://www.esurveyspro.com/ \"free online survey\nsoftware\")\n\n### MOST VIEWED\n\n      * 1 [Minority Engineering Forum Examines College Affordability](https://diverseeducation.com/article/52587/)\n      * 2 [\u201cYou Don\u2019t Look Like a Professor\u201d](https://diverseeducation.com/article/113239/)\n      * 3 [Famous Actress and Family Reflect on the Impact of Upward Bound](https://diverseeducation.com/article/126429/)\n      * 4 [10 Signs of Institutionalized Racism](https://diverseeducation.com/article/64583/)\n      * 5 [HBCUs: For Colored Kids When Predominantly White Institutions Aren\u2019t Enough](https://diverseeducation.com/article/111264/)\n\n## LATEST TWEETS FROM DIVERSE >>\n\n[Tweets by @DiverseIssues](https://twitter.com/DiverseIssues)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n![](https://www.efvrgb12.com/93643.png?trk_user=93643&trk_tit=jsdisabled&trk_ref=jsdisabled&trk_loc=jsdisabled)\n\n\u00d7\n\n      * [Home](http://www.diverseeducation.com)\n      * [About Us](http://diverseeducation.com/about-us/)\n      * [Contact Us](http://www.diverseeducation.com/contact-us/)\n      * [Advertise](http://www.diverseeducation.com/advertise/)\n      * [Press Releases](http://www.diverseeducation.com/press-releases/)\n      * [Editorial Calendar](http://www.diverseeducation.com/editorial-calendar-2/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Diverse: Issues In Higher Education, a CMA publication.  \nCox, Matthews, and Associates, Inc., 10520 Warwick Ave, Suite B-4, Fairfax, VA\n22030\n\n      * [PRIVACY POLICY](http://diverseeducation.com/privacy-policy/)\n\n"}, {"item": "4 work-life survival tips for you and your team -

Here's how to foster a more supportive\nenvironment that works for both employees and business\n\n[up](/article/2020/2/4-work-life-survival-\ntips?rate=97EfJuutmuNvaC5WC85kBtyRsFkOzehb02VnUSTqFY4 \"up\")\n\n37 readers like this\n\nBy [Stephanie Sponsel](/user/stephanie-sponsel \"View user profile.\") |\nFebruary 07, 2020\n\n![](https://enterprisersproject.com/sites/default/files/styles/620x350/public/cio_timethief.png?itok=M-k-\nSxI0)\n\n[Work-life balance ](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/8/blended-\nnot-balanced-8-ways-reclaim-sanity-work-and-home?page=1)\u2013 at least as media\nand corporate culture typically view it \u2013 is a myth: A perfect alignment of\nthe two is just about impossible. Just ask any working parent. That doesn\u2019t\nmean that you can't have both a prosperous career and a thriving family life.\nLet\u2019s start by discussing the importance of prioritizing.\n\n**[ Finding balance starts with prioritizing:[7 tips to declutter your work\nlife](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/1/7-tips-declutter-your-\nwork-life). ]**\n\nEarly in my career \u2014 before I formed a hard stance on what work-life balance\nis and isn\u2019t \u2014 I joined the local chapter of the Advanced Women Leaders (AWL)\nand asked my peers to weigh in on this topic. From this discussion, I learned\ntwo important things:\n\n  * Business leaders, and our workforce in general, need to foster a workplace culture that empowers employees to prioritize what\u2019s personally important to them throughout the day. It is imperative to accept that we can only give our best to whatever is happening at that moment, and that every day will be different.\n  * Working parents should strive to prioritize each workday based on what goals are most important to them. If your child has a soccer game at 3:30 p.m., for example, try to prioritize the workday in a way that supports your family and meets your work obligations. Be agile and remember that prioritizing tasks, meetings, appointments, and childcare is a daily, sometimes even hourly, requirement.\n\nBe agile and remember that prioritizing tasks, meetings, appointments, and\nchildcare is a daily, sometimes even hourly, requirement.\n\nWhen I took maternity leave as a high-level leader in my organization, I\nworked to make the transition smooth and easy for my colleagues and my family\nby identifying the goals that were most important to me. This approach enabled\nme to plan more effectively and return to work ready to hit the ground\nrunning.\n\nThis didn\u2019t come easily. It took years of practice and the experience drawn\nfrom three previous maternity leaves. When company leaders offer empathy and\nsupport for employees who take leaves of absence \u2014 to care for a new baby or\nan ailing parent, or simply to recharge \u2014 the workplace becomes a more\ndesirable and welcoming environment when those employees return.\n\nHere are some of the lessons I've learned that help me juggle my work and home\nlife every day, plus related tips for leaders.\n\n## Plan ahead, and ask for the support you need\n\nBy the time my fourth child arrived, I had accumulated years of experience to\nguide my maternity leave plan. After my first and second children were born,\nfor example, I threw myself full-speed-ahead into work and quickly suffered\nburnout.\n\nTo avoid this the third time, I implemented touchpoints with my colleagues and\nmy team to get important updates on business and customer performance. As part\nof the management team, I met regularly with the CEO during my leave in order\nto establish action items she would need from me when I returned.\n\nAnother strategy that proved indispensable: My team regularly updated a\nspreadsheet detailing client proposals, current projects, and a future\npipeline I\u2019d need to monitor when I returned full-time. This spreadsheet\nenabled me to return to work one step at a time instead of jumping in at a\nfull speed, which in turn reduced stress levels and increased efficiency and\nproductivity for the entire team.\n\nSupport at work is vital, and it is a key component for working parents.\n\n**_Leadership tip:_** _Prior to an employee\u2019s leave of absence, establish a\nplan that sets guidelines for how you will keep the employee up to date.\nConsider setting a return date that falls in the middle or toward the end of\nthe week so the employee can ease back into the workday routine._\n\n## Lose the guilt\n\nToday, 50 million Americans are working parents. In a survey by the Pew\nResearch Center, [65 percent of parents](https://hbr.org/2019/07/a-working-\nparents-survival-guide) responded that juggling child-rearing and a career is\n\u201csomewhat difficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\n\nWhen we feel that we aren\u2019t giving 110 percent, we feel guilty. This guilt can\nfeel endless and exacting, and it can penetrate the daily lives of first-time\nand seasoned parents alike.\n\nSetting the bar to give 110 percent to everything, all the time, is\nunrealistic. Be realistic about what you can reasonably complete and\nprioritize accordingly. If your child is sick, stay home. If there is a\nparent-teacher conference, go. It might mean going to work earlier or staying\nafter hours to compensate, but you should not feel guilty for prioritizing\nfamily matters and maintaining a reasonable schedule that lets you do that.\n\n**_Leadership tip:_** _Implement wellness initiatives that help employees\nidentify with each other. Set up a book club for working parents or develop\nsmall discussion groups that meet regularly to encourage open discussion about\nworking parenthood. Focus professional development programs on reasonable\ngoal-setting and productivity tools and tips._\n\n## Take a break \u2013 use your PTO\n\nMost employees in the U.S. do not use all of their paid time off (PTO) before\nthe end of each year. In 2017, Americans used only 54 percent of available\nPTO, leaving an estimated [$62.2 billion of lost\nbenefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/only-28percent-of-americans-plan-to-\nmax-out-their-vacation-days-this-year.html) on the table.\n\nMuch research has been done about the [health and productivity\nbenefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/25/vacation-can-make-you-more-\nproductive--just-ask-the-europeans.html) of taking vacation time, and those\nbenefits apply to new and seasoned parents alike. Employees are more creative\nand productive when they take time off to step away from the everyday stresses\nof work and recharge.\n\nTaking regular breaks during the workday is equally important. In fact,\nresearch suggests that the most productive workers take [17-minute breaks\nevery 52 minutes](https://executive.mit.edu/blog/want-to-be-more-productive-\nin-2018-take-more-breaks). Researchers also found employees learn and retain\ninformation more effectively when they take [frequent breaks throughout the\nday](https://executive.mit.edu/blog/want-to-be-more-productive-in-2018-take-\nmore-breaks).\n\n**_Leadership tip:_** _Develop an incentive program that encourages employees\nto take time away from the office. Offer small financial incentives (if\npossible) that help workers plan a trip or experience a bucket list item, and\nreward employees who return and share that experience with colleagues._\n\n## Laugh often, and don\u2019t sweat the small stuff\n\nNumerous studies show the [mental and physical benefits of\nlaughter](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200504/laughter-the-\nbest-medicine), especially in the workplace. [Laughter increases oxygen\nintake](https://hbr.org/2018/11/the-benefits-of-laughing-in-the-office),\nimproves circulation, releases endorphins, and relaxes muscles.\n\nFinding humor when things do not go as planned will reduce employee stress\nlevels and help foster important relationships in the workplace.\n\nThings will inevitably go wrong at work and at home. Granted, this is easier\nsaid than done, but practicing flexibility and finding humor when things do\nnot go as planned will significantly reduce employee stress levels and help\nfoster important relationships in the workplace.\n\nThese skills are especially critical for working parents. Constantly feeling\nthat \u201cI have a million things to do today,\u201d is exhausting and disempowering,\nand when we don\u2019t complete tasks during the day, we can feel defeated and\nenslaved to lists. Prioritize the big tasks and let the rest go \u2013remember that\nyou can complete only so many things in one workday.\n\n**_Leadership tip:_** _Organize and promote fun events that are specifically\nintended to leverage humor. Construct recreational areas in the workplace that\ngive \u201cemotional breaks\u201d for employees during the day._\n\nMORE ON WORK-LIFE BALANCE\n\n  * [Finding balance: CIOs share how they prioritize work and family](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/finding-balance-cios-share-how-they-prioritize-work-and-family)\n  * [5 work/life balance tips from Chicago CIO of the Year winners ](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/6/5-worklife-balance-tips-chicago-cio-year-winners)\n\n## The bottom line on balance\n\nWork-life balance is a fictional narrative: Having a family and a flourishing\ncareer is certainly possible, but the two won\u2019t be perfectly balanced.

Covid-19** ](/news/wastewater-test-could-provide-early-warning-of-covid-19-)\n\nRecent evidence points to the increasing \u2018youth gap\u2019, with 19 per cent of the\nsector\u2019s workforce aged 55 or older and only 8 per cent under 24, compared to\nthe 12 per cent national average.\n\nBuilding on its long-term \u2018Inclusion Commitment\u2019, Energy & Utility Skills will\ncollaborate with Youth Employment UK, employer members and strategic partners\nto inspire more young people into critical industries.\n\nAs a leading youth organisation, Youth Employment UK will work closely with\nEnergy & Utility Skills to realise the Inclusion Commitment. This includes the\nsupport of Talent Source Network \u2013 the online platform that connects young and\ndiverse talent with career and training opportunities in 25 leading utility\nand energy employers.\n\nThrough the meaningful partnership, both organisations will use their\nexpertise to support, promote and guide young people to roles or training\nprovision in the sector or to get \u2018work ready\u2019 by developing additional skills\nthrough the \u2018Young Professional\u2019 programme.\n\nEnergy & Utility Skills has also recently become a chartered \u2018Youth-Friendly\nEmployer\u2019. By signing up to Youth Employment UK\u2019s charter, Energy & Utility\nSkills has committed itself to raising the visibility of opportunities within\nthe sector and providing quality opportunities to young talent directly.\n\nCadent, which owns the UK\u2019s largest gas distribution network, and Morrison\nUtility Services are leading the way as early adopters in supporting the\npartnership and the charter by providing expert support to young people.\n\nKate Davies, Energy & Utility Skills' chief operating officer, said: \"Over the\nnext ten years, our sector will require over 221,000 skilled and professional\nworkers to ensure we have the people we need in our growing sector.\n\n\"Attracting more young talent into our profession is key to driving innovation\nand future-proofing our workforce. By partnering with Youth Employment UK, we\ncan ensure that we are building an industry that is attractive to and\nrepresentative of young people. This will support our inclusive culture and\ndeliver diverse and vibrant teams.\n\n\"We\u2019re delighted that we\u2019re able to build upon the momentum of our recent\nInclusion Commitment and look forward to working with our members and Youth\nEmployment UK to develop this work further.\"\n\nLaura-Jane Rawlings, Youth Employment UK chief executive, said: \"We are\nthrilled to be working with Energy & Utility skills to support them and their\nmembers to become youth-friendly employers.\n\n\"We understand the challenges that many sectors are facing, and by working\ntogether with Energy & Utility Skills we will be able to provide additional\nsupport to their \u2018inclusion commitment\u2019 and link our key services - so that\nmore young people can be inspired to engage with careers in the sector.\n\n\"We know that many employers in the energy and utility sector are committed to\ngood quality youth employment and it will be great to recognise and support\nthem as youth friendly employers and connect them with the more than 65,000\nyoung people using our skills and careers resources each month.\u201d\n\nCadent HR director Chris Mead said: \"We are delighted to be an early adopter\nin the Youth Employment partnership. This aligns to our workforce strategy and\nour drive to encourage and inspire a more diverse workforce. Cadent is working\nhard to encourage under-24s into our business, offering internships,\napprenticeships and many more opportunities. Being youth-friendly is key to\nsupporting them develop their potential and get them work ready, whilst at\nCadent.\"\n\nMorrison Utility Services HR director Colin Jellicoe added: \u201cWe work hard to\nprovide excellent career paths for young people in our business.\n\n\"We also make time to go out into the community to explain the sheer variety\nof opportunities on offer. Our schools workshops and work experience\nplacements offer the chance to see where young people can realise their full\npotential and enjoy a fulfilling, lifelong career in the utilities sector.\n\n\"As a youth-friendly employer, our work will continue alongside strong allies\nin Youth Employment UK, Energy & Utility Skills and Cadent Gas.\"\n\nTo mark the start of the partnership, Energy & Utility Skills and Youth\nEmployment UK will be attending April\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group for\nYouth Employment along with Anne Milton, Minister for Skills and\nApprenticeships, and Cadent and Morrison Utility Services, as part of the\ninquiry into the role employers play in youth employment.

This involves\nmatching students to learning goals and activities that are most appropriate\nto where their learning is. It is about meeting the individual needs of all\nstudents, including those who have learning difficulties and those who are\noutstanding.  \n  \nTeachers spend a considerable amount of time coming to understand their\nstudents in terms of their levels of learning motivation, their attitudes\nabout and approaches to learning, their receptiveness to different\ninstructional practices and what they know and don\u2019t know. Their goal is to\nmeet the diverse learning needs of all the students in their class.  \n  \nSo, what happens when students arrive at university?  \n  \n**One size fits all**  \n  \nWhile universities provide credit recognition for formal study completed\nelsewhere and recognition is given for prior work and other relevant\nexperiences, universities tend not to allow students to \u2018skip\u2019 certain\nsubjects or content areas even if they can demonstrate proficiency in the\narea.  \n  \nFor example, the first-year undergraduate who attained top marks in their\nfinal-year results at school in all aspects of their English subject must\nstill enrol in the mandatory introductory communications topic.  \n  \nDoesn\u2019t this constitute a waste of time for the student who could have been\ngiven an exemption based on demonstrating proficiency and who could then enrol\nin another subject relevant to their degree?  \n  \nAlthough students can fast-track their degree by about one semester by\nenrolling in a three-semester year \u2013 an option not all but more universities\nare now offering \u2013 universities tend not to accelerate students through their\ndegree by allowing them to take a higher semester load than usually\nprescribed, for example, six subjects per semester rather than the traditional\nfour.  \n  \nUniversities tend not to allow self-directed students who have worked through\nthe content material of a subject to complete the required final assessment\ntask, usually an end of semester examination, earlier than the scheduled exam\nperiod.  \n  \nA lot of these practices appear to be driven by what is \u2018easiest\u2019 for\nuniversities to administer rather than by the learning needs of students. And\nwhen almost all universities behave in the same way, there is really no\ninducement for such practices to change.  \n  \n**Adapting the culture**  \n  \nIt would be na\u00efve to suggest that it is feasible to change certain practices\nor that some could change overnight. For example, it is impractical for\nuniversity teachers to adapt instruction to each and every student they\nencounter when class sizes can exceed 400 or so students at any one time.  \n  \nHowever, more attention could be given to incorporating strategies that more\nably meet the different backgrounds, experiences, prior learnings, interests,\nambitions, levels of motivation and approaches to learning of university\nstudents.  \n  \nGiven the current teaching-learning context, it is also unrealistic to change\nthe principal teaching methods that have dominated university teaching-\nlearning for hundreds of years, namely, lectures, tutorials and laboratory-\ntype activities.  \n  \nThese tend to prove the most economical and efficacious methods for reaching a\nlarge number of students. While they are complemented by other methods such as\nobservations, practical demonstrations and discussions, they underpin how most\ncontent is delivered to students, namely, in face-to-face and in digital form.  \n  \nCurriculum content is generally also not up for negotiation. It has been\ndesigned to meet particular higher education standards along with the\nexpectations of the relevant profession. Employers rely on higher education\nproviders to deliver qualified and skilled employees who know and understand\nand are able to do certain things; and graduates expect they will have the\nprofessional attributes that make them \u2018work-ready\u2019.  \n  \nHowever, universities could provide the brightest undergraduate students with\nopportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and aptitude up front if they say\nthe subject content is one they have covered or know.  \n  \nIf a student can prove their proficiency by completing the set assessment\ntasks to a satisfactory level of achievement, why not allow them to\ndemonstrate this, receive credit and enrol in a more advanced subject relevant\nto their degree?  \n  \nAnd similarly, why not make provision for those independent self-directed\nstudents who can work at an accelerated pace to complete the required final\nassessment tasks when they are ready to do so rather than make them wait until\nthe end of the semester?  \n  \n**The right to be challenged**  \n  \nUniversities provide many forms of student learning support to the less\nacademically able to help develop their skills in time management, note-\ntaking, referencing, how to prevent plagiarism, how to better prepare for\nexams, academic writing, statistical literacy, academic writing and how to be\ncritical thinkers.  \n  \nBut all students are entitled to be supported to achieve a level of success\nnot just comparable to the knowledge and skill level they come to university\nwith, but one that demonstrates they have been challenged and extended in\ntheir intellectual development. And that means putting in place practices that\ncater better for smarter students.  \n  \n_Nita Temmerman (PhD) is a former university pro vice-chancellor (academic)\nand executive dean of the faculty of education at the University of Southern\nQueensland, Australia.

(Alisha Jucevic/The Columbian) Photo Gallery\n\nRIDGEFIELD -- Shop classes aren't as prevalent at high school today, but a\ngroup of Ridgefield High School students have spent time recently working on a\ncar.\n\nYou won't see the car cruising Pioneer Street anytime soon, though. Instead,\nit'll most likely be seen on the playground at Union Ridge Elementary School.\nThe high schoolers are part of Ridgefield's new Center for Advanced\nProfessional Studies program, in which students work with outside companies on\nprojects.\n\nOne group of students teamed up to transform a toy car into an adaptive car\nthat will allow students with special needs to drive around a playground\nduring recess and socialize with their classmates. They used grant funds to\npurchased a toy remote car large enough for a child. They removed the seat and\nreplaced it with a car seat, which they secured to the car to keep the student\ndriving safe.\n\n\"We found two students in the district where something like this would really\nhelp them go out during recess to be around other students,\" said Malachi Lee,\na senior at Ridgefield High School who is working on the car.\n\nOn a visit before winter break, the students were working on continuing to\nlock the car seat into place using seat belts.\n\nThe CAPS program started in the spring, and there were 36 juniors and seniors\nin it when the program returned this fall. The program lasts two periods of\nthe day, and is based in portable classrooms at Union Ridge. Students travel\nfrom the high school to Union Ridge and dress in more work-appropriate clothes\nthan the typical high school student might wear to class.\n\nThere are three strands available to follow: engineering, health sciences and\nbusiness, marketing and entrepreneurship. The adaptive car is a rare project\nwhere students from multiple strands are teaming up.\n\n\"Times have changed,\" Superintendent Nathan McCann said. \"It's easy for all of\nus to look back on our childhood a little more rose-colored than might merit.\nA lot of people think the younger generation is more selfish because they\nseemed more focused on themselves, but I don't believe it. Kids today are\nevery bit committed to their communities and doing good work. They want to\nmake an impact.\"\n\nThat was a big reason why McCann was first interested in bringing the CAPS\nprogram to Ridgefield after seeing it used at a district in Utah. CAPS is a\nnational program that looks to bring students into the professional world\nwhile teaching them skills to succeed outside the classroom.\n\n\"People think students just graduate and they're work ready,\" said Kara\nBreuer, health sciences instructor in the Ridgefield program. \"They're not.\"\n\nEach strand has an instructor from the high school. In addition to Breuer,\nAndrea Reinertson teaches the business, marketing entrepreneurship strand and\nSteve Rinard leads the engineering cohort. All three also teach at Ridgefield\nHigh School. Tiffany Gould, the district's director of career and technical\neducation and federal programs, leads the CAPS program. Ridgefield High School\nPrincipal Christen Palmer also helps oversee the program.\n\nThe three teachers helped students connect to local businesses or\norganizations looking for help on projects. It's then up to the students to\ncollaborate with those organizations, pitch ideas, set up times to talk and\npresent their projects. Reinertson said the program is the \"ultimate\nconnection between education, community and business.\" The instructors said\none important thing they've had to teach students is that failure doesn't mean\na project ends -- just that they have to come up with another idea and try\nagain.\n\n\"Not everything will be a success,\" Gould said. \"We want this to be a learning\nenvironment for the students to show them how to approach things in the\nbusiness world.\"\n\nThat's not the only major hurdle students have faced, according to the\ninstructors.\n\n\"It's an ongoing process to teach time management,\" Rinard said. \"Students\nknow how to cram for a test or assignment. You can try to do one of these\nprojects in one night, but you're going to have a bad project and fail. So we\nhave to go over time management a lot. Many of their mentors see time\nmanagement as the greatest asset they can have.\"\n\nStudents have worked on projects for Elkhart Plastics in Ridgefield, Oregon\nHealth & Science University and a company that creates lasers. They also have\nguest speakers and do job shadows.\n\nThe Columbian is becoming a rare example of a news organization with local,\nfamily ownership.

A job\nshadow can be really impactful. Most kids don't get an opportunity like that.\"\n\nStudents in the program also get to work on projects in their community. A\ngroup of seniors in the program -- Hunter Abrams, Nathan Neil, Aida Sinks,\nBrooke Weese and Ethan Barnette -- were tasked with designing inclusive\nplaygrounds for elementary schools, which will then be part of the district's\n[February 2020 bond campaign](https://www.columbian.com/news/2019/oct/31/as-\nridgefield-grows-school-district-prepares-to-put-bond-back-on-ballot/).\n\n\"I enjoy science classes a lot,\" Weese said. \"So that led me in this\ndirection.\"\n\nThe instructors and McCann say they hope to add more strands as the program\ncontinues to grow. There are no prerequisites for joining the program,\nalthough there is an application process. The instructors said they don't want\nto go above 20 students in each strand right now. Gould said one idea for the\nfuture is to add a digital design strand. Construction is also a possibility,\nshe added. McCann said he's interested in looking at a drone technology focus\nand a mental health one.\n\nRegardless of what future strands the program adds, McCann said he's confident\nbringing CAPS to

OpenClassrooms\n\n####  This story is available exclusively on Business Insider Prime. [Join BI\nPrime](/subscription/prime?r=readmode) and start reading now.\n\n  * Corporations are spending billions to retrain workers amid an intense battle for tech workers. And several top companies are turning to OpenClassrooms to help do that.\n  * Cofounder and CEO Pierre Dubuc launched the company when he was 11 years old, when he and cofounder Mathieu Nebra couldn't find the courses they wanted at school. Now the company has trained about 3 million students and operates in 130 countries.\n  * While partners like Microsoft believe traditional educational pathways are still relevant, the rise of OpenClassrooms and other online institutions show just how eager organizations are to pursue a number of different pathways to upskill and retrain their workforce.\n  * Amid the coronavirus pandemic, OpenClassrooms is offering its platform for free to academic institutions and other professional training firms.\n  * [Click here for more BI Prime stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/prime?module=article&area=summary).\n\nCompanies are investing heavily to retrain workers as the [war for tech talent\nintensifies](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-skills-in-highest-\ndemand-2019-9).\n\nAmazon [pledged $700 million to retrain a third of its\nworkforce](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-plans-to-retrain-a-third-of-\nus-workforce-2019-7) in the next six years. The professional-services firm\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is [similarly investing $3 billion to retrain\n275,000 employees](https://www.businessinsider.com/pwc-announces-3-billion-\njob-retraining-investment-as-competitive-edge-2019-9) in the next four years.\nAnd [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-companies-using-virtual-\nreality-in-the-workplace) is in the middle of training 1,000 new artificial-\nintelligence engineers.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common? The companies are relying on\nOpenClassrooms to help. With Amazon, for example, OpenClassrooms is reskilling\nfulfillment-center workers to make them web developers or digital marketers.\n\nThe company previously announced a new executive education program in\npartnership with Stanford University. The six-month, master's level curriculum\nincludes coursework curated by professors and faculty at the esteemed college\naimed at giving managers the \"skills and confidence they need to transform\ncompanies, big and small,\" according to a blog post [detailing the\ninitiative](https://blog.openclassrooms.com/en/2020/02/03/openclassrooms-with-\nstanford-online-preparing-todays-leaders-for-technological-changes-ahead/).\n\nThe partnerships show just how critical new educational pathways outside\ntraditional colleges are to companies trying to overcome the talent shortage\nthat is hindering digital-overhaul efforts. And as the coronavirus pandemic\nshutters colleges, high schools, and other professional training programs,\nOpenClassrooms is offering its platform [for free to educational\ninstitutions.](https://openclassrooms.com/en/p/academic-continuity)\n\n\"Reskilling was nowhere 10 years ago,\" OpenClassrooms CEO and cofounder Pierre\nDubuc told Business Insider. \"Now you have so many large companies investing\nmassively on upskilling and reskilling as a way to uplift their workforce,\nimprove the employer's brand, increase the loyalty of their employees. It's\ndefinitely a tipping point right now.\"\n\nDubuc's journey to grow OpenClassrooms started early. When he was 11 years\nold, Dubuc and his cofounder, Mathieu Nebra, began creating online courses\nbecause they could not find the classes they wanted at their school. Now the\ncompany has trained about 3 million students and operates in 130 countries. It\nalso guarantees that graduates will find a job within six months or get their\nmoney back.\n\n\"It's really a way for us to make sure that we'd build the right curriculum\nwith the right competencies in high demand on the markets [and] to update\nthose curriculum regularly,\" Dubuc said.\n\n## Microsoft's challenge to train new AI engineers\n\nEach enrollee in OpenClassrooms has a dedicated mentor they meet with every\nweek via video conference. The goal is to have a highly personalized\nexperience for each student. But the company also tailors the educational\nprograms to the needs of the client.\n\nWith Microsoft, for example, it is training employees on general AI skills,\nand it also has more specific courses on Azure, the tech behemoth's cloud\nplatform. So over the course of the one-year program, students will meet with\ntheir mentor 50 times and emerge with a master's degree, along with a\nMicrosoft certification in AI.\n\n\"We obviously are experts in our technology, but our core competency is not\nmaking someone employable,\" Ed Steidl, the director of offering and\npartnerships at Microsoft, said. The goal with the OpenClassrooms partnership\nis \"getting people who are work-ready deployed, upskilled, and reskilled, and\nback into the marketplace in a relatively short time frame.\"\n\nWhile Steidl still sees a role for higher education, legacy institutions are\nlimited in their online offerings and, according to Dubuc, can't handle the\npace at which corporations need to reskill employees.\n\n\"Which local community college can create 1,000 AI engineers? The scaling is\nreally an issue,\" he said.\n\n## Determining the return on investment from retraining initiatives\n\nOne relative unknown is how effective these retraining efforts will be and how\nto effectively measure the success of the programs.\n\nPwC is taking a client-centric approach to evaluating its own initiative by\nasking, among other things, how they view the professional-services firm\ncompared with the competition, then evaluating the feedback across the three-\nyear training exercise to see if it improves. It's also tracking whether\nemployee retention rises for those who enroll, and if increased performance\nresults in financial gains.\n\n\"Working with these new tools should allow them to do more with less, or do\nthe same with less,\" Mame-Mor Fall, the workforce-strategy manager at PwC,\nsaid. \"That should reflect in our financial metrics.\"\n\nSome of OpenClassrooms' other clients are also seeing success in their\nreskilling efforts. It worked with an energy company that became connected to\na smart grid and was faced with a declining need for technicians who worked on\nmeters (this meant the meters could be managed remotely). The company wanted\nto invest in training those employees to become IT workers and application\ndevelopers.\n\n\"We had more than a 90% success rate, meaning they went from technician to\ndeveloper,\" Dubuc said. That outcome is about average across OpenClassrooms.\n\nBut it's not just the companies that are seeing radical transformations in\ntheir workforce. One enrollee studied in prison to become a freelance web\ndeveloper. Another was a cashier at a supermarket who is now a digital-product\nmanager making three times her salary. The stories help inspire\nOpenClassrooms' employees to continue the mission.\n\n\"Every week, we have an all-hands meeting with the team -- we're a team of 200\n-- and we ask a student graduate to tell her story in front of the team,\"\nDubuc said. \"It's so emotional, people telling what they have been through and\nhow that's challenged and impacted their lives.\"\n\n###  SEE ALSO: [Frito-Lay's transformation chief on how drooping bags became\none of the biggest problems in the digital overhaul effort at $186 billion\nPepsiCo's most profitable division](https://www.businessinsider.com/frito-lay-\nchief-transformation-officer-outlines-its-ai-strategy-droopy-bags)\n\n###  NOW WATCH:\n\nMore: [BI Prime](/category/bi-prime) [Strategy Prime](/category/strategy-\nprime) [inline](/category/inline) [Negotiable Deal](/category/negotiable-deal)\n\n  * [Innovation Insider](/category/innovation-insider)\n\nChevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous\n/ next navigation options.\n\n[ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0\n0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](//www.businessinsider.com \"Visit Business Insider\") Follow us on: [\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0\n1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider \"Facebook\") [\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0\n1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://twitter.com/businessinsider \"Twitter\") [\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0\n1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider \"Connect with us on\nLinkedIn\") [ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider \"Subscribe to our YouTube\nchannel\") [ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://www.instagram.com/businessinsider \"Instagram\")\n\n[ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0\n0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id554260576?mt=8) [\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0\n1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freerange360.mpp.businessinsider)\n\nAlso check out: [ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp) ](//www.thisisinsider.com \"Visit\nInsider\") [ ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](//markets.businessinsider.com \"Visit Markets Insider\") [\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0\n1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](//intelligence.businessinsider.com/?utm_source=businessinsider&utm_medium=site_footer&utm_term=bi_site_footer&utm_content=bi_site_footer&utm_campaign=bi_site_footer\n\"Visit BI Intelligence\")\n\n* [Copyright (C) 2020](https://www.insider-inc.com/terms/) Insider Inc.
