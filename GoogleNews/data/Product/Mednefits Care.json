and other companies to meet employee\nneeds in the area of health benefits\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | February 4, 2019\n\nTopics: [Compensation and\nBenefits](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-921346680.jpg)\n\n\n\n**About the Author**  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mednefits-\nChris.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mednefits-\nChris.png)Chris Teo is the CEO and co-founder of Mednefits.  \n  \nMany SMEs and start-ups are undermined by inadequate corporate health\nbenefits, causing them to lose out to big corporations in terms of benefits\nfor their employees.\n\nMaking matters worse, in Singapore, the cost of healthcare benefits is\nexpected to increase by 9.1% in 2019 due to the rising cost of medical\ntechnology and profit motives of healthcare providers.\n\nTraditionally, corporate health insurance products typically offer outpatient\nand inpatient insurance together as a costly bundle.\n\nBecause of their steep prices, these bundles are often inaccessible or\nunappealing to SME employers.\n\nHowever, providing great healthcare benefit experiences and controlling costs\nneed not be competing priorities. By leveraging on new tools, innovation, and\nimproved access to data, health benefits can be made affordable and simple.\n\nSMEs can consider adopting a customisable progressive benefits package,\ngranting them greater control on healthcare investments.\n\nBeyond primary care such as General Practitioners (GPs) and specialists,\ncompanies can stretch their existing employee benefits packages to include\naccess to a wider range of services from health screenings to Traditional\nChinese Medicine and wellness, as well as access to preventive wellness\nprogrammes such as fitness classes, yoga and eye care.\n\nThese initiatives will encourage employees to keep themselves healthy,\nresulting in lower illness-related absenteeism, increased productivity, and\nreduced sick leave.\n\nUnderstanding this, what are some concrete, low-cost steps for SMEs to meet\nemployee needs when it comes to health benefits?\n\n\n\n### Research current market practice and offerings\n\nTraditionally, employee health benefits includes health check-ups,\nhospitalisation benefits, GP consultations and dental benefits.\n\nHowever, the market has grown competitive, with companies offering a broader\nrange of health benefits such as optical care, gym passes, fitness classes and\nphysiotherapy.\n\nCompanies who wish to attract and retain top talents should offer a greater\nvariety of benefits on top of traditional health benefits.\n\nIt is also important for companies to find out what employee health benefit\nstrategies competitors are using to stand out among the competition.\n\n\n\n### Survey your employee demographics and their respective needs\n\n\"Aone-size-fits-all approach to employee benefits is no longer enough to cater\nto the diverse needs of employees in our multi-generational workforce today.  \n---  \n  \nA one-size-fits-all approach to employee benefits is no longer enough to cater\nto the diverse needs of employees in our multi-generational workforce today.\n\nUnder-utilisation of employee benefits is one of the biggest issues plaguing\ncompanies. By surveying employees on what they need in their benefits package,\na company can gain greater insight into the employees\u2019 needs, and even whether\nthey are aware of what benefits are offered.\n\nThe company can then scale back on under-utilised benefits, while placing more\nfocus on what their employees really need.\n\n\n\n### Leverage on technology to automate repetitive workflows\n\nAfter researching on employee benefits offerings and understanding the needs\nof their employees, companies should review their current HR workflow to see\nhow can leverage on technology to digitise repetitive administrative\nworkflows.\n\nThrough technology, benefit claims processing can be digitised, freeing up HR\nprofessionals to focus on higher value work that contribute to business\nproductivity, such as ensuring that the company\u2019s overall benefits are\ncompetitive in the market or analysing real-time data on how benefits can\nimpact employee retention.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\ncan-smes-take-better-control-of-their-employee-health-benefits-investment%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+can+SMEs+get+the+most+from+their+employee+health+benefits%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\ncan-smes-take-better-control-of-their-employee-health-benefits-\ninvestment%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\ncan-smes-take-better-control-of-their-employee-health-benefits-investment%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.
