What it does not do, alas, is auto-update itself. PowerToys fans will\nhave to wait until version 0.17 for that particular delight. Instead, handy\nFile Explorer preview pane viewers for Markdown (`.md`) and SVG files have\nbeen added along with a very useful Image Resizer extension.\n\nAfter selecting one or more files, the Resizer shows a dialog with a host of\nsizes as well as encoding and file copy options. It's a neat tool, even if an\ninveterate tinkerer could achieve something similar through the command line.\n\nThe fourth new toy is the Window Walker (aka Product Launcher), which is a\nmore useful version of the Alt-Tab switcher Windows users have become familiar\nwith over the years. Rather than cycle through running applications, a tap of\nCtrl and the Windows key brings up a box into which a user can type text to\nfind a running process.\n\nWe're not entirely convinced by the searching used by default (for example,\ntyping \"word\" brings up both the eponymous word processor as well as any other\nrunning window that has the letters w, o, r and d in its title, like some sort\nof demented _Seasame Street_ character) but it's a handy thing for those\nalready used to launching apps by keyboard rather than clicking.\n\nThe only PowerToy missing in action remains the Quick Launcher, currently\npencilled in for version 0.18, due in May. A final v1.0 release is tentatively\nscheduled for September, just in time for Microsoft's [newly digital Ignite\nconference](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/01/microsoft_ignite_goes_digital).\n\u00ae\n\n[ Tips and corrections\n](mailto:corrections@theregister.co.uk?subject=%5Bcorrection%5D%20Microsoft%27s%20PowerToys%20suite%20sprouts%20four%20new%20playthings%20with%20a%20final%20March%20emission&body=re:%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/01/powertoys_0_16/\n\"Spotted an error or have a tip?

PVCAD\nMega delivers precise solar engineering and layouts for tracker and fixed-tilt\nprojects of any size in five minutes or less.  \n\n#### More Headlines\n\n  * [Residents and Businesses Can Earn Cash for Energy Saving Actions Through Innovative \"GridRewards\" Pilot Program](/content.php?post=32972)\n  * [Total Corporate Funding in the Solar Sector Comes to $1.9 Billion in Q1 2020, Reports Mercom Capital Group](/content.php?post=32971)\n\n[ ![Click\nHere!](//ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=28&pid=2&position=1)\n](http://ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=28&pid=2&lookup=true&position=1)\n\n  * [Joules Accelerator & the Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster Select Next Cohort of Entrepreneurs to Accelerate Energy Innovation in the North Carolina Cleantech Corridor](/content.php?post=32970)\n  * [Bidgely Demonstrates How Personalized, Digital-Centric Home Energy Reports Increase Energy Savings by 80% ](/content.php?post=32969)\n  * [Webinar shows how to get more from heat network metering & billing ](/content.php?post=32967)\n\n#### Articles\n\n  * [Upcoming Webinars - PV Mounting in Asphalt and Metal Roofs](/content.php?post=32942)\n  * [Fire Protection for Stationary Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage Systems](/content.php?post=32918)\n  * [Assessment of Ransomware Event at U.S. Pipeline Operator](/content.php?post=32913)\n  * [Solar Light Systems Provide Crucial Light Sources in Remote Oil Fields](/content.php?post=32911)\n  * [What is the Safest Energy for the Future?](/content.php?post=32904)\n\n  \n\"Solar engineers love CAD software because it provides responsiveness and the\nprecision canvas they need to create accurate drawings in a way that cloud\nsoftware can't match,\" explains PVComplete CEO Claudia Eyzaguirre. \"But\nvanilla-variety AutoCAD wasn't created with solar in mind. It doesn't know how\nto design for optimal energy production. With PVCAD Mega, solar engineers now\nhave a uniquely solar flavored CAD product for the first time. The platform\ndelivers essential CAD performance while also providing solar functionality,\nincluding integrated racking and module databases.\"  \n  \nIn addition to enabling the industry's fastest layout speed, PVCAD Mega also\nimproves the accuracy of project modeling with advanced capabilities such as\ntopography pier analysis. Where legacy utility scale project design relied\nupon slope analysis based on aerial site views and computations of an average\ngrade, PVCAD Mega now makes pier analysis at scale possible for the first\ntime, replacing average grade with unique post heights for every pier on a\nproject site. The result is more informed constructability and equipment\ndecisions, as well as lower material and installation costs.  \n  \nOther key features include:  \n* Click-and-drag full and partial tracker blocks and angled layouts   \n* Automatic placement of partial trackers, access roads and equipment pads   \n* Advanced topography analysis in less time, including custom topo data   \n* Side-by-side layout comparisons that reveal the outcome of different structural component selections   \n* NEXTracker and Array Technologies integrations   \n  \n\"Five years ago, PVCAD raised the bar on solar project design for residential\nand commercial rooftops, carports and other sites in built environments,\nmeeting the highest standard of precision within the AutoCAD environment,\"\nadds Eyzaguirre. \"Now, PVCAD Mega is poised to similarly revolutionize solar\nprojects built on terrain. In an era in which large, flat square project sites\nhave given way to those with boundaries that resemble a gerrymandered\npolitical district with varied terrain, new design practices are essential.\nPVCAD Mega empowers everyone in the utility-scale solar project development\nand EPC process to more rapidly and accurately design, optimize and construct\nfixed tilt and tracker installations worldwide in today's challenging utility-\nscale environment.\"  \n  \nThe platform has already been deployed on behalf of leading utility-scale\nsolar developers and EPCs, including Lightsource BP, a strategic partnership\nformed in 2018 between Lightsource Renewable Energy and global energy company\nBP. \"PVCAD Mega has been instrumental in increasing our productivity,\" says\nLightsource PV Development Engineer Leonardo Silva. \"Having the ability to\ncreate large-scale tracker layouts in minutes that are up to Lightsource\nstandards for quality, efficiency and effectiveness is a game changer for us\nand is helping accelerate our project deployment throughout North America.\"  \n  \nPVCAD Mega is available with or without bundled AutoCAD software on a monthly\nor annual subscription basis.

This product is the world's\nfirst EV charger with an integrated PV inverter. Reducing the hassle of\ninstalling separately a standalone EV charger and a PV inverter, the EV\ncharging inverter eliminates the need for additional wiring, conduit and a\nbreaker installation. By installing an EV charger that is integrated with an\ninverter, no additional dedicated circuit breaker is needed, saving space and\nruling out a potential upgrade to the main distribution panel. Whether you own\nan EV now or just want to be EV-ready, future-proof your home with SolarEdge.\n\n[More Products](/products.php)\n\n[Feature Your Product](/register_partner.php)\n\n#### Sponsors\n\n[ ![Click\nHere!](//ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=28&pid=2&position=1)\n](http://ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=28&pid=2&lookup=true&position=1)\n\n[ ![Click\nHere!](//ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=28&pid=2&position=1)\n](http://ljb.advertserve.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=28&pid=2&lookup=true&position=1)\n\n[![Newsletters](/images/site\nicons/Newsletter_Button.jpg)](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=s9wzelzab&p=oi&m=1126729309010&sit=br6cuoelb&f=8b32144a-55f0-447e-9976-c46235d44213)[![White\nPapers](/images/site icons/WhitePapers_Button.jpg)](/whitepapers.php)\n\n[![Events](/images/site\nicons/EventsCalendar_Button.jpg)](/events.php)[![News](/images/site\nicons/News_Button.jpg)](/stream/news/)\n\n#### Most Popular Articles\n\n[What is the Safest Energy for the Future?](/article/2020/03/what-is-the-\nsafest-energy-for-the-future/32904)\n\n03/22/20 | [Other Energy Topics](/category/other-energy-topics)\n\n[Fire Protection for Stationary Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage\nSystems](/article/2020/03/fire-protection-for-stationary-lithium-ion-battery-\nenergy-storage-systems/32918)\n\n03/25/20 | [Energy Storage & Grids](/category/energy-storage)\n\n[Upcoming Webinars - PV Mounting in Asphalt and Metal\nRoofs](/article/2020/03/upcoming-webinars-pv-mounting-in-asphalt-and-metal-\nroofs/32942)\n\n03/31/20 | [Solar & Wind](/category/solar-wind)\n\n[Assessment of Ransomware Event at U.S. Pipeline\nOperator](/article/2020/03/assessment-of-ransomware-event-at-us-pipeline-\noperator/32913)\n\n03/24/20 | [Other Energy Topics](/category/other-energy-topics)\n\n[Solar Light Systems Provide Crucial Light Sources in Remote Oil\nFields](/article/2020/03/solar-light-systems-provide-crucial-light-sources-in-\nremote-oil-fields/32911)\n\n03/24/20 | [Solar & Wind](/category/solar-wind)\n\n[Articles & Stories](/stream/articles/) | [News](/stream/news/)\n\n#### Events and Conferences\n\n[Roof Tech Webinar - PV Mounting in Asphalt and Metal Roofs.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/ai-wearable-fight-coronavirus-face-\ntouching/) __\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, three Seattle entrepreneurs have created\na wristband that vibrates when the person wearing it goes to touch their face,\nartificial intelligence (AI) startup\nImmutouch[announced](https://immutouch.com/march_9_2020_press_release.pdf) on\nTuesday (March 10).\n\nAlong with hand-washing, medical professionals are advising the public to\navoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth during the worldwide outbreak. Since\nthe virus first surfaced at the end of December, 116,400 people have been\ninfected in at least 103 countries, according to [official\ncounts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).\nAs of Tuesday morning (March 10), some 4,082 people with the disease have\ndied. All but 946 are in mainland China.\n\n\u201cThe Immutouch wearable vibrates when the user\u2019s hand enters a precalibrated\nposition, such as near the mouth, nose or eyes. Instantaneous alerts can\nprovide immediate intervention for habitual touchers, while vigilant users can\nrefine good habits over time,\u201d a press release from the company said.\n\nCo-founders of the company \u2013 brothers Matthew Toles and Joseph Toles and their\nfriend Justin Ith \u2013 were motivated to develop a tool after someone died of the\nvirus a few miles from their Seattle homes. There are at least [162 confirmed\ncases](https://q13fox.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-death-toll-\nreaches-22-statewide-after-three-more-life-care-residents-die/) in the state\nof Washington and 22 deaths there, 20 of which are in Kings County in Seattle.\n\n\u201cA problem the size of COVID-19 requires everyone to do their part, large or\nsmall,\u201d said Matthew Toles, 28, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cThe three of us happened\nto be uniquely well-equipped to tackle this one task and felt it was our duty\nto at least try.\u201d\n\nThe trio tapped designs from a previous project and were able to launch the\nImmutouch wearable in just seven days.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first wearable for the entrepreneurs. In 2015, they founded\n[Slightly Robot](https://slightlyrobot.com/) and developed a device similar to\nImmutouch that was geared toward reducing compulsive skin picking, nail-biting\nand hair-pulling, also known as trichotillomania.\n\n\u201cBoth wearables use gravimetric hand position, meaning assets like the\nexisting inventory of printed circuit boards and portions of the codebase\ncould be repurposed for the new device,\u201d according to the release. \u201cThis\ntechnological cannibalism enabled the breakneck pace of development necessary\nto help combat [COVID-19](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/covid-19/) while there is\nstill time. It typically takes over a year to bring a product to market.\nImmutouch took 1/50th of that time.\u201d\n\nAmazon [told employees](https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/coronavirus-\namazon-adjusts-attendance-policy-trip-com-chairman-ceo-stop-taking-salaries/)\nin Seattle, Bellevue and the San Francisco Bay area to telecommute if possible\nthrough the end of March.

GameSpot\nmay get a share of the revenue if you buy anything featured on our site.\n\n## Click-clack, front and back. Read about our favourite gaming keyboards,\nfeaturing Steelseries, Razer, Logitech, HyperX, and Corsair.\n\nBy [Edmond Tran](/profile/doorselfin/) |\n[@EdmondTran](https://twitter.com/EdmondTran), [Peter Brown](/profile/doc-\nbrown/), and [Michael Higham](/profile/highammichael/) |\n[@michaelphigham](https://twitter.com/michaelphigham) on April 7, 2020 at\n1:38PM PDT\n\nKeyboards are an unavoidable part of the 21st century. We hammer out texts on\nour phones, mash the WASD keys while testing out a [new\nkeymapping](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-controls-\nguide-hotkeys-and-keyb/1100-6472601/) for [Escape From\nTarkov](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-pre-order-guide-\nall-early-acces/1100-6472569/), and type out personal details to fill out\nforms on our laptops. And if you do a lot of typing, you may as well buy a\ngreat keyboard that can make it fun to write the next great novel _and_ make\nyou a better gamer, however slightly. With so many [great games available on\nPC](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pcs-5-best-games-\nof-2019/2300-6451785/)\\--and major hits like [Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-pre-order-guide-\nbonuses-new-release/1100-6459539/), [Marvel's\nAvengers](https://www.gamespot.com/marvels-avengers/), and [more on the\nway](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-release-dates-of-2020-switch-\nps5-xbox-series-/1100-6469273/)\\--it's worth investing in a good keyboard for\ngaming.\n\nWhen it comes to finding the right keyboard and mouse setup, you have to know\nwhat you want. Some like their keyboards small, flat, and quiet, while others\nprefer the tactile key switches, larger profile, and satisfying sounds of a\nmechanical gaming keyboard. High-end keyboards get more elaborate every year,\ntoo, which means there are more factors, like keyboard backlighting, ergonomic\ndesign, N-key rollover, and response time to think about.\n\nIf you're serious about your gaming experience on PC, especially for action-\nheavy games like shooters or real-time strategy games, then a dedicated,\nmechanical gaming keyboard can come with a host of advantages. They can\nprovide better ergonomics for increased comfort over a standard keyboard,\nmaking them a better purchase in the long run; they can provide a more defined\n(and potentially faster) response time due their better key switches, to make\nsure you know you did the thing; with a good backlight, they can potentially\nplay host to an extravagant light show that might let you know when something\nbad (or good!) is happening in your game.\n\nThere's a lot to think about when you're looking for the best gaming keyboard,\nand there are a lot of different options on the market to choose from. We've\nbeen fortunate enough to try a number of currently-available keyboard models,\nand in this article, we've rounded up our personal favourites to help give you\nan idea about what you might want out of your perfect keyboard.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right keyboard, you have to be aware of some\nterminology, especially as it relates to mechanical switches. First off,\nlinear versus tactile switches keys. **Linear** means there is no physical\nfeedback mechanism to indicate when a keystroke is registered. It's smooth,\nrelatively quiet, and preferred for rapidly tapping on keys. **Tactile** means\nthere is a bump or click to indicate you've hit the actuation point; it's\nlouder, but some prefer having physical feedback for keystrokes. It really\ncomes down to preference. **Actuation point** is the distance at which a\nkeystroke is registered; a shorter distance means you don't have to press the\nkey down as far, but can lead to errant inputs. **Actuation force** is, well,\nthe force needed to press the key down.\n\nWhile Cherry has been the long-time dominant manufacturer of mechanical\nswitches, some gaming peripheral brands have started making their own\nproprietary mechanical switches for their keyboards, namely Razer and\nLogitech.

Such is the case with the G512/G513\nmodels of its mechanical gaming keyboard design--they're an improvement over\nthe G413 in subtle, but important ways. These newer models sport full RGB\nbacklighting that's customizable through Logitech software, and the option to\ncome equipped with Logitech's own Romer-G mechanical switches. While the G413\nintroduced the Romer-G tactile switches, the new linear option is what makes\nthe G512/G513 some of the quietest gaming keyboards out there.\n\nLinear switches don't have the clicking-and-clacking of tactile ones, but the\nsound of the key bottoming out remains loud. However, Romer-G switches soften\nthe blow by design, reducing the amount of contact between parts. When using\nmy tenkeyless Razer keyboard with linear switches and my G513 side-by-side,\nthe difference in noise is night and day. Romer-G isn't necessarily a\ncompromise either; it's a fast and accurate mechanical switch, like its Cherry\nand Razer counterparts. The only thing I noticed is that a keystroke itself\nmay not feel as buttery smooth.\n\nThe G512/G513 is a simple design executed just right. It has exposed LED-\nbacklit keycaps for easy cleaning and a sleek brushed aluminum frame means the\nkeyboard backlighting looks premium but not gaudy. One USB pass-through is at\nthe top-right of the chassis and media functions are relegated to the F-keys.\nA perk specific to the G513 is that it comes with a padded palm rest that\nattaches magnetically, which feels much better than plastic ones seen on other\nkeyboards--that's the main difference between the two models and may not be\nworth the price difference. Overall, they're great packages, and you should\ndefinitely consider either one if you want a mechanical keyboard without the\npotential noise complaints.\n\n  *  **Price:** $100 USD (G512) or $150 USD (G513) // $120 AUD (G512)\n  *  **Switch Types:** Romer-G Linear or Tactile, GX Blue\n  *  **Available in Tenkeyless:** No\n\n[ Logitech G512 $100 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Keyboard-\nRomer-G-Tactile/dp/B07L6JVJCX?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n[ Logitech G513 $130 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Backlit-Mechanical-\nKeyboard-Keyswitches/dp/B07B2XCDMV?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Gaming Keyboard For RGB Lighting Effects\n\n### HyperX Alloy Origins\n\n[![No Caption\nProvided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3609585-hyperx_alloy_origins.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3609585-hyperx_alloy_origins.jpg)\n\n **The Good**\n\n  * Incredibly vibrant lighting effects\n  * Slick, strong, and weighty build\n  * Exposed keycaps make it easy to clean\n  * Smooth, responsive switches\n  * Detachable USB-C cord\n\n **The Bad**\n\n  * No USB passthrough\n  * NGenuity software is unreliable\n\nThe Alloy Origins from HyperX is a very well-made all-rounder keyboard at a\nreasonable mid-range price. The aluminum build feels incredibly solid and\ngives the keyboard quite a bit of weight, but it's still a compact unit with\nexposed keycaps, minimal trim around the edges, and a detachable USB-C cord.\nIt comes in three different variations with HyperX's custom switches (linear,\ntactile, and clicky)--I tested the linear version which felt very smooth and\nresponsive (the key travel is 1.8mm), even if the overall travel (3.8mm) is a\nlittle bit longer than I personally prefer for long stretches of typing.\n\nYou can set it at three different angles to suit your ergonomic setup. It also\nhas a Game Mode that disables keyboard shortcuts like Alt+Tab--another nice\ntouch. Other than that, there aren't a whole lot of bells and whistles--no\nmacro keys, not even USB passthrough. As the \"Origins\" name might suggest,\nthis is a slick, strong, no-nonsense keyboard with a focus on responsiveness.\n\nBut the thing that really makes the Alloy Origins stand out are exposed LEDs\nit uses for its RGB lighting. Instead of having the lights sit underneath each\nkeyboard switch, they lay alongside them. This results in an incredibly vivid\neffect where coloured lighting not only comes through each keycap but emanates\na distinctive aura underneath each keycap too, which is visible even my\nbright, sunny office. It's stunning, especially when compared directly to\nother models, and especially once you set up some of the more audacious\ntrigger effects like explosions or fades.\n\nThe only caveat is that the HyperX NGenuity software required to program the\nlights can be a little finicky--I wasn't able to get the software to detect\nthe keyboard on my home PC at all, but your mileage may vary. It's a pretty\nuser-friendly piece of software, however--I was able to very quickly and\neasily set up my keyboard with a beautiful, twinkling cherry blossom idle\neffect with lingering fade lights as I typed, and bright red explosions when I\nhit backspace. If style is your priority, the Alloy Origins is a great pick.\n\n  *  **Price:** $110 USD // $200 AUD\n  *  **Switch Types:** HyperX Custom Switches (Linear, Tactile, Clicky)\n  *  **Available in Tenkeyless:** Yes\n\n[ $122.24 at Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/159047/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Form-\nMacro-Customization-Light-Factor-Compact-Origins-Keyboard-LED-RGB-Alloy-\nLinear-Red-Software-Controlled-Switch-HyperX-Backlit-Mechanical-\nGaming/904339328?irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwYwtUzTE3U0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_159047&clickid=27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwYwtUzTE3U0&subid1=gs|gs-1100-6471780)\n\n[ $110 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Software-\nControlled-Customization/dp/B07W86N3JV?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Gaming Keyboard: Compact/Tenkeyless Mechanical\n\n### Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition\n\n[![No Caption\nProvided](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![No\nCaption\nProvided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3609593-razer_huntsman.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3609593-razer_huntsman.jpg)\n\n **The Good**\n\n  * Razer's own switches are among the best\n  * Strong build quality with aluminum chassis\n  * Detachable USB-C cable\n  * Low actuation point means slightly faster input registry...\n\n **The Bad**\n\n  * ...but can lead to typos or mistaken inputs\n  * Keystrokes can be loud, even for linear switches\n\nThere's something novel about a compact tenkeyless keyboard; they're cute. If\nyou have no use for the number pad and/or want to have a minimalist desk\nsetup, they're definitely up your alley. If that's what you're into there's a\nton of options out there, as tenkeyless is quite popular among the PC gaming\ncrowd, which was born out of the need for small keyboard at cramped LAN\ncompetitions. But which one should you get? The Razer Huntsman Tournament\nEdition is an easy choice.\n\nRazer's Huntsman keyboards have a sleek aluminum chassis and an overall no-\nnonsense design. The Tournament Edition specifically is the tenkeyless\nversion, and it features a long detachable braided USB-C cable, which makes it\neasier to take places if you need to. It also retains the Razer Chroma RGB\nlighting though the backlighting isn't as vibrant as other Razer keyboards.\nWhat makes these keyboards special are the options you have for mechanical\nswitches. Each of Razer's own switches (Green, Yellow, and Orange) are tuned\nfor competitive gaming with short actuation points and fine-tuned reset\npoints; they're also consistently smooth to the keystroke. I've mainly used\nRazer Yellow with the Huntsman TE, and it's my preferred setup for when things\nget serious.\n\nThe fast response and short actuation point may also lead to more errant\ninputs, mainly from resting your hand on the keys; it's something to be\nmindful of. And the Huntsman isn't designed for the courtesy of others around\nyou as full keystrokes can be really loud. If neither of those are big\nconcerns, then it'd be hard to overlook the Razer Huntsman.\n\n  *  **Price:** $130 USD // $200 AUD\n  *  **Switch Types:** Razer Orange, Green, or Yellow\n  *  **Available _not_ in Tenkeyless:** Yes\n\n[ $130 at Razer ](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-\nhuntsman-tournament-edition)\n\n[ $130 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tournament-\nTenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07V25YPVW?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Gaming Keyboard: Wireless Mechanical\n\n### Logitech G613\n\n[![No Caption\nProvided](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![No\nCaption\nProvided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3609594-logitech_613_wireless.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3609594-logitech_613_wireless.jpg)\n\n **The Good**\n\n  * Long battery life (AA required)\n  * Fast input response that matches that of wired keyboards\n  * Affordable, especially considering how few options are available\n  * Romer-G tactile switches work well\n\n **The Bad**\n\n  * Not the best looking keyboard\n  * Plastic wrist rest comes attached, making it a bit bulky overall\n\nWireless mechanical keyboards are hard to come by, since there are so few\noptions available. That's not the only reason why we recommend the Logitech\nG613, though. Input latency is at the top of concerns, but that's been largely\nsolved as seen with wireless gaming mice, and Logitech adapts its \"Lightspeed\"\ntech found in its mice for the G613. It's also a fantastic budget gaming\nkeyboard.\n\nThe G613 is a full-size keyboard in every sense. It features a built-in\nplastic wrist rest, which is handy, but not detachable. There are six\nprogrammable macro keys on the left side of the keyboard and a suite of media\ncontrols at the top-right, too. Most importantly, the G613 stands among the\ngreat mechanical keyboards out there because of its fast response and accurate\nmechanical switches. It only comes with Romer-G tactile switches, which isn't\nso bad because these provide all the benefits of a mechanical switch like\nsmooth, consistent keystrokes.\n\nWhile you'll need to stock up on AA batteries, the G613 is quite efficient,\nlasting up to 18 months according to Logitech--it's so efficient, we're not\neven talking in hours anymore. And only once did I have to swap out batteries\nsince I took it in as my main keyboard for work back in 2017. It'd be pretty\nannoying to swap out batteries for a keyboard every few months, so this is\nkey. A reason why battery life last this long is because one common feature\nhas been left behind: backlit keys. Keys are painted in a vibrant white that\nhelps visibility, but of course it's not the same as proper backlighting.\n\nConsidering its feature set and the fact that it's one of the few wireless\nmechanical keyboards out there, the Logitech G613 is fairly affordable,\nespecially when it's on sale. The prospect a wireless gaming keyboard may not\nbe as appealing as a wireless mouse (you're not constantly moving a keyboard\naround and dragging a cord after all), but those who want to cut the cord\nwithout sacrificing keyboard quality have a great option here.\n\n  *  **Price:** $129.99 USD // $135 AUD\n  *  **Switch types:** Romer-G Tactile\n  *  **Available in Tenkeyless:** No\n\n[ $130 at Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/159047/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-G613-Wireless-\nMechanical-Gaming-\nKeyboard/488776282?irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwd2pUzTE3U0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_159047&clickid=27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwd2pUzTE3U0)\n\n[ $130 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G613-Lightspeed-\nMechanical-Multihost-Connectivity/dp/B07796MBJ7?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Gaming Keyboard: Best Build Quality\n\n### Corsair K68\n\n[![No Caption\nProvided](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![No\nCaption\nProvided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3609595-corsair_k68.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3609595-corsair_k68.jpg)\n\n **The Good**\n\n  * Solid, sturdy build that's also water-resistant\n  * Dedicated media keys are convenient\n  * Smooth keystrokes with multiple options for Cherry MX switches (for RGB models)\n\n **The Bad**\n\n  * None to speak of\n\nThe Corsair K68 is an all-around solid keyboard--solid, of course, as in it\ncan take a beating. It's pitched as the mechanical keyboard that'll withstand\nthe hazards that might accompany someone's desk, like spilled liquids. On to\nof being water-resistant, it's housed by a thick, sturdy chassis. While\nCorsair's product page shows the keyboard being showered on, we tested it\nourselves in our K68 review--it turns out it can take showers. There's a\nprotective membrane beneath the keycaps and shields the mechanical switches\nfrom damage, and any liquid it takes on is funneled out of the board.\n\nThose are some of the perks specific to the K68, but it's an overall top\nperformer. We've only used it with Cherry MX Red switches and, as expected,\nthey work like a charm, providing smooth and responsive keystrokes. You have a\nfew options when it comes to K68 models, however. There's a cheaper version\nthat only comes with red LED backlighting and Red switches, but you'll have to\nkick in a few more bucks to get the RGB backlit version which also lets you\nchoose between Cherry MX Red, Blue, or Speed switches. Both models do feature\nsome nice, chunky media control buttons at the top-right, and they come packed\nwith a detachable wrist rest with rubber texture.\n\nThere's nothing bad to say about the K68, really. You can't go wrong if you're\nlooking for a great mechanical keyboard, especially if you're accident-prone\nor just want to make sure your investment doesn't get destroyed so easily.\nIt's also a budget gaming keyboard, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\n  *  **Price:** $90 USD (Red LED) / $120 USD (RGB) // $150 AUD (Red LED) / $190 AUD (RGB)\n  *  **Switch types:** Cherry MX Red, Blue, or Speed\n  *  **Available in Tenkeyless:** No\n\n[ $97 at Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/159047/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Corsair-\nGaming-K68-Mechanical-Keyboard-Backlit-Red-LED-Cherry-MX-\nRed/342745066?irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwdzNUzTE3U0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_159047&clickid=27Yy9-S9AxyJRKIwUx0Mo3chUknTwdzNUzTE3U0)\n\n[ $80 at Amazon ](https://assoc-\nredirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-Mechanical-Keyboard-\nBacklit-Resistant/dp/B0716Q4932?tag=gamespot-best-\nlists-20&ascsubtag=ag%3Ags-1100-6471785%7Cvg%3A-%7Cst%3Adtp)\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Gaming Keyboard: Premium High-End For Serious People\n\n### SteelSeries Apex Pro\n\n[![No Caption\nProvided](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![No\nCaption\nProvided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3609597-steelseries_apexpro.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3609597-steelseries_apexpro.jpg)\n\n **The Good**\n\n  * Adjustable mechanical switches are impressive\n  * Switches are smooth and relatively quiet\n  * Very solid and compact (ignoring the wrist rest) construction\n  * Lots of meaningful luxuries that make it feel high-end\n  * Comprehensive customisation software\n\n **The Bad**\n\n  * It's relatively expensive\n\nThe SteelSeries Apex Pro is a high-end keyboard that, on top of looking and\nfeeling the part in basically all respects, sports a pretty innovative feature\nthat currently only exists in maybe [one other\nkeyboard](https://www.amazon.com/WOOTING-\nClicky%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D55%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D-Analog-\nMechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07772B3HX): Adjustable mechanical switches. That's\nright--you can adjust the trigger point of each individual key on the main key\nspread to suit your preference, meaning you can program them to only activate\non a full, concerted press (about 3.6mm) or the lightest of touches (a shallow\n0.4mm).\n\nIs that useful? It can be! A common example would be if you're a keyboard\nstickler who spends long stretches of time both typing and playing PC games,\nlike me. You might prefer longer, deeper actuation to help with accuracy and\nreduce any slips while typing, and a much lighter actuation to increase\nresponse times in action games. The SteelSeries Engine software makes it easy\nto build these profiles (which can be saved onboard the keyboard itself for\nhardware-side activation), and conveniently allows you to script automatic\nprofile switching for when a particular application becomes active (like\nChrome or Apex Legends, for example).\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the linear nature of the switches remains the\nsame regardless, and there are no other options if you prefer a clicky or\ntactile switch. That said, the way the keys respond can still feel like night\nand day depending on where you are on the actuation scale.\n\nA host of wholly unnecessary but luxurious features include a tiny OLED\ndisplay plus a dedicated media playback and volume control wheel, both of\nwhich help navigate the onboard UI, which allows you to customise every aspect\nof the keyboard without having to launch the software, though it's certainly\nnot as efficient. The display can easily be customised to display 1-bit,\n128x40 pixel gifs, and supports integration with a limited selection of\nprograms like Discord, Dota 2, CS:GO, Mortal Kombat 11, and Tidal (if you use\nTidal for some reason) to display vital information.\n\nIt features USB passthrough, cable routing, macro keys, a magnetic soft rubber\nwrist rest, and exposed LED lighting for individual keys. The aluminum\nconstruction is incredibly durable as you'd expect--it features an exposed\nkeycap design, and it sports a very compact trim, much like the HyperX Alloy\nOrigins (though the lighting isn't quite as vibrant).

With all of their needs, a growing majority of customers\nturn to the web, and home-buyers are no different.\n\nBut, how do you allow your real estate listings online available and findable?\nYou will customize the listings for search engines through Search Engine\nOptimization (SEO), which improves their popularity in the search results,\nensuring more eyes and offers on your usable assets.\n\nIf you want to know more about SEO tips for real estate websites, including\nSEO strategies to help you make your real estate business grow, then keep\nreading. If you are searching for technical tools for SEO of your real estate\nlistings, click this link to find out a complete suite of SEO tools.\n\n### What specifically is SEO?\n\nBefore start doing SEO with your real estate listings, it's necessary to\nunderstand first what exactly it is. SEO is basically the way in which website\ncontent is tailored for high performance in search engines like Google. If you\nrate high, the search results will reveal the website to web users who are\nlooking for words specific to your website, such as \"houses in New York.\"\n\nRealtors usually tackle SEO tools by incorporating high-traffic keywords to\nthe material of their website. Although this isn't inherently a poor idea,\ntailoring the keywords to draw the best customers for particular listings may\nbe a lot of effort.\n\n### How to perform SEO on real estate websites?\n\nBy specifically designing a real estate website for SEO, you will achieve\nsignificant traction. Read how SEO for real estate websites should be\nimplemented. These tips and tricks for implementing various SEO techniques for\nreal estate websites will come in handy whenever you think your website is not\nperforming up to the mark.\n\n### Your website should be responsive and effective\n\nYou can begin with a responsive website to optimize the scope of your website.\nYour future buyers are most likely entering addresses into mobile devices into\nsearch engines and hoping to locate listings for real estate.\n\nAn efficient website for real estate listings is the cornerstone of SEO. When\nyour website has been set up and is fully usable, you will shift your\nattention to refine the quest for real estate listings.\n\n### Conduct keyword research\n\nAnalysis of keywords for real estate websites is an important aspect of SEO\nstrategy. You need to learn the parameters of the search, which will take\nprospective clients to the website and listings of real estate. When you know\nthese words, you'll incorporate them creatively into your lists.\n\nThere are several resources to do keyword analysis, but Google's keyword\nplanner is one of the strongest. Google Ads account is a great place to find\nout how many other firms are contending with same words and how many other\ncustomers are looking for terms specific to your product.\n\n### Optimize real estate website for search engines\n\nAfter you have discovered the best keywords for your listings, you'll want to\nuse them where necessary. Avoid the desire to include them in any single\ncolumn, because it is called \"keyword stuffing\" and can impact the rankings\nadversely, but place them anywhere it makes sense.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to find a 1000 square foot flat in New York, you\ncould find it as \"1000 Square Foot flat in New York.\" However, if the keyword\nanalysis tells you that more people are searching for a \"single bedroom flat\nin New York,\" that's obviously a better option.\n\n### SEO tips for real estate\n\nGain the most benefit by using SEO for your real estate website with these SEO\ntricks.\n\n#### Use relevant but local keywords\n\nSince your property is situated in one city practically, find certain keywords\nthat define the metropolitan region. When you list a property in New York, for\nexample, think about how buyers in the region would look for properties. Think\nabout broader terms such as \"Central Park\" or \"Central District,\" and then do\nsome work on such keywords.\n\n#### Write the address in body and header tags\n\nBe sure to include the town, zip code, and street address as part of your SEO\ntechnique for the real estate website. This should attract attention to the\nweb page to make it convenient for the search engines.\n\n#### Promote your real estate business with blogs\n\nWhile search engines are incredibly helpful to get traffic on your pages,\ndon't rely on them to do all the work. Make sure you link to your individual\nlistings from your website and recommend you have a section on your homepage\nshowing your new assets. Write several blogs and use them as guest posts and\nblog posts. Use a grammar checker to write perfect content and a plagiarism\nchecker to make sure your content is plagiarism-free.\n\nIt may also be a perfect way to bring guests up-to-date on new listings if you\nhave a forum. Don't be too optimistic and avoid losing followers, but\nincluding a couple of different products that you think that attract your\nreaders at the bottom of a post might possibly inspire some new buyers.\n\n#### Promote on social media\n\nAdding links to your social networking site listings can help with public\nvisibility. That said, beware of not doing anything very much. When your\nsocial media load their news-feeds with real estate ads, your followers may\nget irritated, so restrict yourself to at most one or two properties a week.\n\n#### Image optimization is a must\n\nPhotos are two of the most significant aspects of the listings for real\nestate. You will help prospective customers want to get in contact with you\nand offer a greater understanding of a property than just email. Nevertheless,\neven though it can perform well for web users, search engines cannot handle\nvisual information. File names and alt definitions are the only way search\nengines can determine what the images are about. So don\u2019t forget to include\nboth of them in the relevant tags of your images.\n\n#### Make a profile on local listings directories\n\nMake sure local profiles are built on all the major real estate listing\ndirectories. Or try joining other online communities, such as online community\nin the city or area. These directories are visited by hundreds of people on\ndaily basis and could be very beneficial for your real estate business.\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nYou can reach more clients and sell more homes with real estate SEO. If you're\nusing SEO for your real estate ads, you'll help the company attract more\nconsumers. Nonetheless, SEO for real estate websites requires time and effort.\n\nWhen you realize that your organization has little resources to devote SEO,\nbut understands the importance of SEO, talk about investing in SEO services\nfor immovable assets. Your company can draw more buyers and sell more homes\nwith qualified SEO services like\n[Prepostseo.com](https://www.prepostseo.com/).\n\n292\n\nSpread the love\n\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  _[](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Top%20SEO%20tips%20for%20Real%20Estate%20websites https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stl.news%2Ftop-seo-tips-for-real-estate-websites%2F317953%2F)_\n  *  _[](https://www.instagram.com/)_\n  *  __\n\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  _[](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Top%20SEO%20tips%20for%20Real%20Estate%20websites https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stl.news%2Ftop-seo-tips-for-real-estate-websites%2F317953%2F)_\n  *  _[](https://www.instagram.com/)_\n  *  __\n\nTags: [Marketing](https://www.stl.news/tag/marketing/), [real\nestate](https://www.stl.news/tag/real-estate/), [search engine\noptimization](https://www.stl.news/tag/search-engine-optimization/),\n[seo](https://www.stl.news/tag/seo/), [we](https://www.stl.news/tag/we/)\n\n## Post navigation\n\n[COVID-19 puts Libya's health service in danger of\ncollapse](https://www.stl.news/covid-19-puts-libyas-health-service-in-danger-\nof-collapse/317948/)\n\n[Candicci's Raises $400 for Food to Donate to Health Care\nWorkers](https://www.stl.news/candiccis-raises-400-for-food-to-donate-to-\nhealth-care-workers/317958/)\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/top-seo-tips-for-real-estate-\nwebsites/317953/#respond)\n\nYou must be [logged\nin](https://www.stl.news/login/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stl.news%2Ftop-\nseo-tips-for-real-estate-websites%2F317953%2F) to post a comment.\n\n### Categories\n\nCategoriesSelect CategoryBusiness  (1,367)Class Action  (3)Conservation -

Under no circumstances can Druva access your data.\n\n### **Insight and Analysis**\n\nHere is a professional\u2019s review of Druva from 2019 on [IT Central\nStation](https://www.itcentralstation.com/product_reviews/druva-insync-\nreview-64309-by-reviewer603831) **:**\n\n**How has Druva helped my organization?** \u201cDruva is one of the most trusted\nbackup solutions for endpoint backup. It has helped us in backing up our\nendpoint machine, hassle-free. It is a very simple-to-use product, and users\ncan even restore their own data. There is no administrative overhead in the\nproduct. You don't need a certified administrator to manage this product. Most\nimportantly, the product is lightweight, as the client installed on a desktop\nor laptop is just 60MB in size.\u201d\n\n**What is most valuable? \"** The features that we find valuable are:\n\n  *     Geofencing (it allow users to restore data only in a specific network)\n  *     Office 365 / G Suite backup\n  *     DLP (Device tracking, Data wipe, and Encryption)\n  *     Druva inSync Share (like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive)\n  *     Restrict admin access to user data\n  *     Mobile phone backup\n  *     You can restrict backups to a specified network (e.g. mobile network)\n  *     Resource throttling (CPU and Bandwidth)\n  *     Legal Hold feature is available\n  *     Compliance feature is also available\"\n\n**What needs improvement?** \u201cThis solution would benefit from the inclusion of\nan on-premise backup feature, as currently, they are offering everything in\nthe cloud. We have seen that some customers prefer on-premise backup, so they\nneed to think about this.\u201d\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is another professional\u2019s review of Druva from 2019 in [Gartner Peer\nReviews](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/data-center-backup-and-\nrecovery-solutions/vendor/druva/product/druva-insync/review/view/1030706):\n\n**Overall Comment:** \"Druva is a simple tool to back up your user's data to\nthe one centralized server. It also offers privacy option for each separate\nuser to decide whether his/her data backed up encrypted or not. This provides\na transparent environment between user and company information security\npolicies.\"\n\n**What do you like most about Druva?** \u201cIt is easy for our users to back up\ntheir files through Druva InSync thanks to the its user-friendly interface.\nAlso, it is install-and-forget application which does not throws error or\nproblems frequently. I never had to check the server and application status\nfor monitoring purposes. This one of its desirable features.\u201d\n\n**What do you dislike most about the product or service?** \u201cSome users (about\n3 users in 650 users) reported high CPU problems during backup process starts.\nAfter analyzing their computers for seeking the core reason of the CPU\nproblem, we couldn't find any logs corresponds to it. That is why it's logging\nstructure is not well developed. As I said in the title, Druva is not an\nenhanced solution for data backup.\u201d\n\n**List of current customers:** Flex **,** Hitachi **,** Live Nation **,**\nMarriott **,** Pfizer **,** San Jose Sharks\n\n**Delivery** : Software-as-a-service, cloud\n\n### **Pricing**\n\n **Subscription/credit pricing:** Consumption based per TB pricing for data\ncenter workloads across cloud and on-premises, as low as $4 per user pricing\nfor endpoints and SaaS apps.

are roasting, and\nAMD\u2019s huge annual update for Radeon Software is rolling out.\n\nWhile previous iterations focused on stuffing in new features\u2014to such an\nextent that [I wondered how AMD could further\nimprove](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3327569/amd-radeon-software-\nadrenalin-2019-update.html) its already-outstanding graphics suite\u2014AMD Radeon\nSoftware Adrenalin 2020 Edition revolves around a gorgeous visual overhaul\nthat puts everything you need in more obvious places. That said, it also comes\nwith some helpful new additions that flesh out existing features, streamline\nyour gaming experience even more, and in the case of the intriguing new Radeon\nBoost, can potentially supercharge your frame rates in fast-paced games.\n\nAdrenalin 2020 Edition can even act as a unified game launcher in [an era of\nwarring platforms](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-\ngames-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html).\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487805/xfx-radeon-rx-5700-xt-thicc-iii-\nultra-review.html)[XFX Radeon RX 5700 XT Thicc III\nUltra](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487805/xfx-radeon-rx-5700-xt-thicc-\niii-ultra-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487805/xfx-radeon-rx-5700-xt-thicc-iii-\nultra-review.html)\n\n[Read PCWorld's review](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487805/xfx-radeon-\nrx-5700-xt-thicc-iii-ultra-review.html)\n\nSee it\n\nThe days of Radeon software inferiority are over. The latest revision in a now\nlong and consistent line of yearly improvements, AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin\n2020 Edition makes an already-great graphics control center even better. Let\u2019s\ndig into the new look, followed by a recap of the new features you\u2019ll find.\n\n[[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming\n]](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3106426/components-graphics/the-best-\ngraphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html)\n\n## AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition\u2019s fresh new look\n\nAMD kicked the aging Catalyst Control Center to the curb in 2015, introducing\na sweeping redesign in [Radeon Software\nCrimson](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2999410/adios-catalyst-meet-radeon-\nsoftware-crimson-amds-slick-new-software-hub.html) that surpassed Nvidia\u2019s\nGeForce Experience in sheer slickness. As new features like ReLive streaming,\nRadeon Wattman overclocking, and AMD Link were added over the years, the\ninterface became increasingly crowded. AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020\nEdition brings it all back together into a more cohesive whole.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/radeon-software-\ninstaller-100820906-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nIt all starts with a completely rearchitected installer that\u2019s up to 34\npercent faster than previous versions. The installer includes the ability to\nkeep your previous settings if you\u2019re upgraded an existing version of Radeon\nSoftware, or you can check a box to perform a clean install and blow any away\npossible cobwebs. You can also choose between WHQL-certified and beta drivers\nwith the latest bug fixes and features when those start rolling out. Groovy.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/startup-wizard-\ngaming-100820902-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nOnce you\u2019re up and running, you\u2019ll be asked to select one of three preset\nprofiles, all of which activate different features by default. The Standard\nprofile turns on FreeSync only when you connect a compatible monitor\u2014a setting\nenabled for all three profiles.\n\nThe Gamer profile focuses on delivering better graphics with great frame\nrates, enabling AMD\u2019s Enhanced Sync, Radeon Image Sharpening, Radeon Anti-Lag,\nand Virtual Super Resolution options. The E-sports profile optimizes around\npure performance when every second of latency matters. It skips Enhanced Sync\nand Virtual Super Resolution, and limits the tessellation image to 8X, with\nRadeon Image Sharpening and Anti-Lag also active. You can manually change each\noption or your profile after setup.\n\nThen you say hello to the new-look Radeon Software interface. You can summon\nit at any time, inside of games or on your desktop, by pressing **ALT** +\n**R**.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/home-not-\nplaying-100820895-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nYour most recently played games are at the forefront of the new interface,\ncomplete with performance metrics and hours played for each title, which AMD\nconstantly tracks in the background now. If you want to hop back into things,\nyou can launch your most recent game with one click.\n\nSelecting the gaming center in the main interface brings you to the new Gaming\ntab, where you can select a title to see the same performance and time\nmetrics, a compatibility checker that compares your current hardware against\nwhat the developers recommend, and graphics and display options galore if you\nwant to set specific settings for the particular game, rather than globally.\nYou can also launch your game from here, regardless of which launcher it\nrequires. Check it out below.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/gaming-game-details-\nadvanced-100820892-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nUnderneath the \u201cLast played\u201d box on the main screen you\u2019ll find some quick\nmedia capture tools allowing you to take a screenshot, record a video, create\na GIF, or capture an instant replay of your last action quickly and easily.\nThese are the sorts of tools that used to live under the ReLive brand, but\nthat\u2019s being retired, with all capture tools consolidated under Radeon\nSoftware Adrenalin 2020 Edition\u2019s Streaming tab. You\u2019ll mind more extensive\nlive streaming and media creation options there. AMD provides everything you\nneed to start recording videos, complete with a scene editor and more\u2014no\ncomplicated third-party software like OBS or X-Split needed if all you want is\na straightforward stream.\n\nFinally, the right rail/column of the main screen is dedicated to basic system\ninformation. You\u2019ll see the status of your drivers and whether new ones are\navailable, along with a Device Status module that shows whether you have a\nphone or tablet connected via AMD Link. (The AMD Link mobile app will receive\nan overhaul of its own to match the look and feel of Adrenalin 2020 Edition.)\nAMD\u2019s Upgrade Advisor lets you know at a glance whether your hardware\u2019s up to\nsnuff for modern gaming, while a Tutorials section shines more light on\navailable features.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/radeon-software-streaming-\ntab-100820907-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nThe Streaming tab interface for live streaming.\n\nYou\u2019ll see different sections available across the app\u2019s title bar.\n**Streaming** holds the video options formerly known as ReLive, as we\u2019ve\ndiscussed. If you\u2019re recording gameplay, pressing **ALT + R** to summon the\nRadeon Overlay in-game displays a different main screen than the standard one\nwe just discussed. You can see it below.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/home-capture-\ncontext-100820893-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nThe **Gaming** tab, again, lets you dig deeper into the details for individual\ngames. A supplementary **Media** section lets you browse through and edit any\nmedia you\u2019ve captured with Radeon Software, while the **Compatibility**\nsection provides a broader overview of whether your hardware meets the\nrequirements for all your games, respectively.\n\nThe **Performance** tab\u2019s **Metrics** section provides just that\u2014a look at how\nyour system hardware\u2019s performing.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/performance-metrics-\nfps-100820896-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nThe **Tuning** section of the Performance tab holds all the overclocking, fan\ncontrol, and undervolting options previously known as Radeon Wattman, a brand\nthat\u2019s also being retired. This is where geeks can optimize their graphics\ncard, complete with an overhauled manual view with dedicated controls for GPU\ntuning, fan tuning, VRAM tuning, and power tuning. The **Advisor** section,\nfinally, grants access to the [beginner-friendly Advisor\ntools](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3327569/amd-radeon-software-\nadrenalin-2019-update.html#toc-1) introduced in last year\u2019s Radeon Software\nupdate, which can help you change profiles and optimize your games and\nhardware.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/performance-tuning-\nod8-manual-advanced-expanded-100820898-orig.jpg) AMD\n\nThe rest of the sections sprawled across the top toolbar should be pretty\nstraightforward. The Settings cog grants access to all the nitty-gritty\noptions you want from GPU software in one convenient location, with settings\nbeyond what you\u2019ll find in the more streamlined main tabs. The Search box,\nwell, searches for any features you can\u2019t find.\n\nOf particular note is in the newly integrated web browser, symbolized with a\nglobe icon. AMD integrated a lightweight, Chromium-based browser right inside\nof Radeon Software, so you can easily search for tips, walk-throughs, videos,\nand anything else when you summon the Radeon Overlay in-game. Sounds handy,\nespecially on resource-constrained systems that might not be able to run\nChrome and a game simultaneously very well.\n\n _Next page: Adrenalin 2020 Edition\u2019s new

Acquisition Case\n\nBy:  [Joe Clabby](/Authors/joe-clabby \"Posts by Joe Clabby\") |  March 04, 2020\n\neWEEK ANALYSIS: Five years ago, Compuware was fading out of existence. The\ncompany's products were stodgy; its leadership was questionable; its revenues\ndeclining. Then new CEO Chris O\u2019Malley intervened, changing the way the\ncompany did business.\n\n**Download the authoritative guide:[Big Data: Mining Data for\nRevenue](https://o1.qnsr.com/cgi/r?WT.qs_dlk=Xo2v0QrIhEIAAGZ1-JsAAADc;;n=203;c=1668429;s=14821;x=7936;f=201911080913470;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;k=https%3A%2F%2Fassetform.eweek.com%2Fcontroller%3Fasset%3D253713510%26srvid%3D95900%26vkey%3D4190310%26io%3D11111%26qid%3D000%26qset%3DCONTACTFORM_HQB%26formHQB%3Dy%26domain%3Dwww.eweek.com)**\n\n![BMC.Compuware.logos2020](/imagesvr_ez/b2bezp/2020/03/BMC.Compuware.logos2020.jpg?alias=article_hero)\n\nHouston-based BMC Software, a $2 billion maker of distributed, cloud and\nmainframe software, [announced this week](https://www.eweek.com/it-\nmanagement/bmc-s-big-week-acquires-compuware-upgrades-helix-platform) that it\nwill acquire Detroit-based Compuware, a $600 million-plus maker of mainframe\nsoftware, at a price tag of $2 billion. With this acquisition, BMC will\nsignificantly increase its mainframe software revenue; add new mainframe\ndevelopment/operations products (DevOps); and acquire experienced, motivated,\ncreative mainframe marketing and development resources.\n\n#### **A Closer Look at Compuware**\n\nFive years ago, Compuware was fading out of existence. The company\u2019s products\nwere stodgy; its leadership was questionable; its revenues declining. And then\nChris O\u2019Malley intervened; when O\u2019Malley became the CEO, he changed how the\ncompany did business in three important ways:\n\n  1. The company expanded its product portfolio by structuring cooperative development agreements with other vendors (including competitors);\n  2. it committed to delivering new and valuable software functionality every quarter (unheard of in the mainframe software industry); and\n  3. O\u2019Malley greatly improved morale\u2014articulating a corporate vision, mission and core values that everyone in the company could buy into\u2014creating a new sense of pride in being a Compuware employee.\n\nThat enthusiasm reached the company\u2019s customers, who voted with their\npocketbooks, steadily growing Compuware [revenues in excess of $600\nmillion](https://incfact.com/company/compuware-detroit-mi/). Compuware\u2019s\ngrowth has come from organic (internal) development, with research and product\nengineers bringing new, innovative solutions and ideas to market, combined\nwith several strategic acquisitions.\n\nIn January 2016, Compuware purchased ISPW (an agile mainframe source code\nmanagement/build/deploy automation solution that works seamlessly with\nJenkins, XebiaLabs and REST APIs within a DevOps toolchain). The ISPW\nacquisition was followed by the acquisitions of Itgrations, Standardware, MVS\nSolutions, XATester and INNOVATION Data Processing in January 2020. (For a\ncomplete view of Compuware\u2019s products and strategies, see this [Clabby\nAnalytics August 2018 report](https://clabbyanalytics.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/10/Compuware%E2%80%99s-Mainframe-DevOps-Strategy-Product-\nOfferings-and-Competitive-Differentiators.pdf) in PDF format.)\n\n#### **A Closer Look at BMC Software**\n\nBMC provides software solutions for multi-cloud management, cognitive service\nmanagement, digital business automation, systems management using artificial\nintelligence/machine learning/predictive analytics, cybersecurity and\nmainframe modernization.\n\nA look back at BMC\u2019s history shows a company that, like Compuware, has also\ngrown through organic development and software acquisition. In 1994, BMC\nacquired Patrol Software; then over successive years the company purchased a\ngaggle of companies: Datetools, Boole & Babbage, BGS Systems, New Dimension\nSoftware, Optisystems, Remedy, IT Masters, Marimba, Identify Software, Service\nManagement Partners, ProactiveNet, RealOps, Emprisa Networks, BladeLogic, MQ\nSoftware, Tideway Systems, Phurnace Software, GridApp, Coradiant, StreamStep,\nNumara Software and now Compuware. BMC acquires companies that bring new\nfunctionality to its series of product offerings\u2014and then uses its development\nresources to integrate those offerings with other products in its portfolio.\n\nIn the mainframe world, BMC currently offers automated mainframe intelligence\n(AMI) based on artificial intelligence/machine learning/predictive analytics\ntechnologies, including BMC AMI for Security and BMC AMI DevOps for IBM Db2.\nThe company\u2019s MainView Systems Management optimizes mainframe systems to\nimprove overall performance and increase availability\u2014helping to detect and\nsolve problems quickly. BMC\u2019s Mainframe MLC Cost Management can help BMC\ncustomers reduce their monthly license charges (MLCs) by up to 30%. The\ncompany also offers two data management products (one for the DB2 database,\nthe other for IMS) that help reduce data management costs.\n\n#### **Summary Observations**\n\nWith the acquisition of Compuware, BMC is adding a sophisticated mainframe\nDevOps (development/operations) environment, build and deploy tools and\nutilities, additional data management, measurement and operations softwareas\nwell as additional compliance/security software. The acquisition expands BMC\u2019s\nreach into mainframe DevOps. Plus, it adds a highly integrated\nworkbench/program analysis/management/test/process flow environment\n(Compuware\u2019s Topaz product suite) to BMC\u2019s mainframe portfolio.\n\nThere is very little product overlap in this acquisition, since the two\ncompanies have largely focused on different aspects of mainframe computing\n(except with regard to operations management, where the two companies\u2019\nproducts do compete). Accordingly, BMC will now have a broader, deeper\nportfolio, enabling it to compete with other vendors in different disciplines\nof mainframe development and management\u2014making way for an even large revenue\nshare of the mainframe software marketplace.\n\nFrom the perspective of Compuware, this deal is also a textbook example of how\nto rebuild a company and up its market value to the point that it becomes\nhighly valuable as an acquisition target. Over the past five years, O\u2019Malley\nand the rest of the company\u2019s management revitalized Compuware\u2019s staff\u2014and\nexcited its customers. A move to agile development practices enabled the\ncompany to bring innovative product solutions to market faster than ever\nbefore. A willingness to work with other software vendors\u2014including\ncompetitors\u2014enabled Compuware to bring greater value to its customers beyond\nwhat it could have delivered using only its own resources.\n\nWe hope to see, as this acquisition takes place, a similar transfer of energy\nand enthusiasm at BMC. We hope that Compuware\u2019s culture of innovation is not\nlost in the assimilation process. We hope that BMC retains most of the\nCompuware\u2019s inventive, high energy organization\u2014and gives that organization\nsome free rein to continue to analyze the market and build new products and\nsolutions for mainframe developers and managers.\n\nBMC Software has shown that it well understands the mainframe market (see this\n[survey](http://documents.bmc.com/products/documents/94/30/519430/519430.pdf),\nthis\n[study](https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1254255&tp_key=414fbb02cf)\nand this [survey](https://www.bmc.com/forms/mainframe-survey-results.html)).\nThe acquisition of Compuware will provide BMC with even deeper insights. With\nthese two companies blended, BMC Software will become an even more formidable\ncompetitor in the mainframe marketplace.\n\n**_Joe Clabby_** _  of  _[Clabby Analytics](https://www.clabbyanalytics.com/)\n_ is a longtime IT market analyst and writer. \u00a9 2020 Clabby Analytics.

The year has started off with a myriad of new tools and sources of data\nfor investors, more advanced and more customizable than ever before-but are\ninvestors any better of than they were ten or twenty years ago?\n\n\u201cThe software industry built\u2014and firms have bought\u2014departmental solutions to\naddress specific needs, but this has created a maze of data silos which in\nturn is creating a data disaster,\u201d Patel explained.\n\nIndeed, an overload of information and technology can be just as detrimental\nas having access to too little information and technology; therefore, less is\nmore: the key to greater success is to act with precision.\n\nBut how can investors effectively use the new tools and technologies they have\nat hand in order to avoid a \u201cdata disaster\u201d?\n\n## Connecting \u201cdata, workflows and financial models into a single integrated\nsystem\u201d\n\nPatel believes that \u201cthe most important trend we\u2019re seeing is companies\nstarting to shift away from this legacy thinking and turning their focus\ninstead on creating a data architecture that centralizes and harnesses data\nacross departments, systems, and external sources.\u201d\n\nWhat does this look like on a practical level?\n\nPatel said that from Mercatus\u2019 perspective \u201cas a company addressing a major\npain point for the fastest-growing segment in investing in the financial\nmarkets, which is the private market, we see some of the biggest brands using\nsoftware that is inherently more flexible and enables them to diversify into\nnew asset classes, regions, and unanticipated new business framework.\u201d\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/go-\nmercatus.jpg)Haresh Patelchief executive officer of Mercatus, data platform\nfor private market investors.\n\nThese kinds of platforms \u201charness and centralize internal and external data\ninputs\u2014from asset operators, energy pricing systems, accounting systems, and\nmore\u2014to facilitate real-time reporting and collaboration across fundraising,\ninvesting and asset management teams.\u201d\n\nIn other words, \u201cthese early adopters are able to connect data, workflows and\nfinancial models into a single integrated system powering data-driven\ndecisions, insights, and reports at speed. With advanced analytics and custom\ndashboards, they are able to quickly gain insight into key trends and KPIs,\nlike performance, risk, forecasts and IRR, all the way down to the asset\nlevel.\u201d\n\n## AI is becoming more popular, but AI isn\u2019t the silver bullet to effective\ninvestment strategies\n\nThe creation of these kinds of tools and platforms has been enabled in part by\nadvances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. \u201cAI-powered solutions can\nempower investment firms to make more informed decisions. This includes high\nprecision data analytics: investment patterns, predictive analysis, and client\nengagement,\u201d explained Victor Fredung, chief executive officer at Shufti Pro,\nan AI-based identity verification service provider.\n\n\u201cUsing machine learning algorithms, investment data can be optimized to\nenhance portfolio management, as well as operational efficiency. It leads to\nbetter reporting, higher accuracy and just better chances of client outreach\nonce decision-making is improved.\u201d\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/david-\nbakke.jpg)David Bakke, finance expert at personal finance blog Money Crashers.\n\nHowever, AI-powered or not, not all algorithms are created equally-\u201dmost\nalgorithms tend to gather \u2018all\u2019 of the data rather than just what\u2019s needed,\u201d\nexplained David Bakke, finance expert at personal finance blog _Money\nCrashers._\n\nBakke believes that, therefore, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 type\nproposition. If you\u2019re going to do this on your own, it will take a lot of\ntime and effort, and you\u2019ll have to be hyper-specific in what you\u2019re searching\nfor. If you\u2019re going to rely on, say, a robo-investing site, there are going\nto be anomalies that simply can\u2019t be accounted for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, in a sense, while it might seem like a better strategy than using no data\nat all, it is a crapshoot.\u201d\n\n## The AI realm will more than likely see improvements in security and\ntransparency, in order to make data more relevant.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bakke does believe that developments in AI could eventually lead to\nthe development of improved algorithms and improved data-gathering systems.\n\n\u201cThe AI realm will more than likely see improvements in security and\ntransparency in order to make data more relevant,\u201d Bakke said. \u201cBeyond that,\nyou should see improvements in gathering more intelligent data and the\nelimination of less necessary data, as this niche continues to improve and\nexpand,\u201d he told _Finance Magnates._\n\nAt the same time, however, Haresh Patel pointed out that the sudden and sharp\nrise in the use of AI in data could be in for some big shifts as regulations\nare built around its usage: \u201cconsidering that the world is rapidly\ntransitioning to digital, AI will influence nearly every aspect of data, from\nthe way it is collected to the way it is shared and analyzed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\nwill be some major changes coming in 2020.\u201d\n\nFor example, \"new landmark legislation to protect privacy and data has taken\neffect in Vermont and in California beginning January 1, 2020, with the states\nrequiring data brokers who collect information about individuals from public\nrecords and private sources to disclose their company names and practices on a\nregistry which consumers can freely access.\u201d\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/victor-1.jpg)Victor Fredung, chief executive officer\nat Shufti Pro, an AI-based identity verification service provider.\n\n\u201cI expect similar measures will take effect in other states, but it is too\nsoon to tell,\u201d he added; therefore, algorithms that take personal data into\naccount in order to inform investors could be affected by these regulations.\n\n## The dawn of alternative data\n\nHowever, developments in artificial intelligence have also enabled the\ncreation of new kinds of [\u201calternative\ndata\u201d](https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/technology/ai-\nalternative-data-mifid-ii-shifting-face-investment-research/) that can be\ncreatively used to inform investors of relevant trends. While alternative data\nhas been around for some time, the field is continuing to grow in popularity-\nbut, like AI, having access to alternative data isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all\nfor good investment strategy; it must be used wisely.\n\nWhat is alternative data, exactly? Zak Selbert, chief executive officer of\nalternative data firm Indexica, [explained in an interview with _Finance\nMagnates_ late last\nyear](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/interview/how-ai-is-\nforming-the-future-of-market-data-in-crypto-beyond/) that his company has\ncreated a series of metrics that crunch news content from all over the globe\nin order to determine market sentiment.\n\n## Suggested articles\n\nFBS Launches Online Trading School - FBS Trading Bootcamp[Go to article\n>>](https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/fbs-launches-online-\ntrading-school-fbs-trading-bootcamp/)\n\nFor example, Indexica\u2019s \u201cSurprise\u201d metric \u201clooks at events around companies-\nso, for example, if there was an event like \u2018Netflix reported subscriber\nlevels that were below expectations\u2019, that would be considered a surprise; or\n\u2018Boeing cancels production of 737s\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnother of Indexica\u2019s metrics, \u201cfuturity\u201d, is a metric that \u201creads language\nand analyzes whether or not the tense [of the language] is in the future or\nthe past\u2026it also extracts times and dates.\u201d\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/zakselbert.png)Zak Selbert, co-founder and CEO of\nIndexica.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d for example, \u201cif [it was] mentioned in a news article that \u2018Amazon was\ngoing to be releasing a fleet of drones next year\u2019,\u201d the company would\nquantify that statement \u201cas being \u2018future\u2019\u201d, Selbert explained, because of the\nuse of the phrase \"next year.\"\n\n\u201cWhereas, if we read an article that said \u2018Boeing grounded its fleet\u2019 of\n737s\u2019, we would ground that as \u2018last year.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, imagine multiplying that type of verbiage by millions of sentences from\nall the text that we read, and then mapping it to publicly traded securities,\u201d\nas well as certain cryptocurrency assets, like Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this metric does\u2013and interestingly, if you look at it, and you\nlook at market performance, there tends to be a very strong relationship\nbetween how often and to what extent a company is spoken about in the future\n[tense], and then the performance of their stock.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the more that a company is mentioned in the future tense, \u201cthe\nbetter it tends to do.\u201d\n\n## When sifting through datasets, investors should search for what is\n\u201corthogonal\u201d\n\nHowever, as clever as alternative data sources may seem to be in and of\nthemselves, alternative data is all but useless if it isn\u2019t used effectively.\n\u201cAccess to good data is simply like having an industry edge that helps you\nmake smart decisions,\u201d Haresh Patel said. \u201cThese are unique insights that let\nyou in on industry trends that may be obvious to a wide range of investors but\nneed to be interpreted smartly to add value to your portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Alternative data] may or may not be helpful for fund managers who are mostly\nlooking for specific trends instead of rough aggregate data,\u201d Haresh Patel\nsaid.\n\nEssentially, \u201cthe key is to categorize data and build profiles based on\ngeographies, markets and personas. In contrast to big data, alternative data\ncan help tailor customer experience and optimize operations.\u201d\n\nBut how can the effectiveness of alternative data be determined? In a more\nrecent call with _Finance Magnates,_ Zak Selbert explained that for example,[\nquant funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantfund.asp) (funds that\nselect securities by utilizing the capabilities of advanced quantitative\nanalysis) usually want to know if \u201ca data set, just on its own in a silo, has\nsome sort of predictive value-and the answer is either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\nSelbert went on to explain that the second question that quant funds usually\nask about a data set is \u201cwhether or not it adds any value\u201d-in other words,\n\u201ctraditional market factors are easily accessible; so if you strip out the\neffects of traditional market factors, does a data set still have value?\u201d\n\nAt this point, \u201cthose that stand out\u201d are \u201corthogonal\u201d-in other words, \u201cthey\nhave no relationship to traditional market factors,\u201d he explained.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/david-\nmetzler-300x300.jpg)David Metzler, , chief executive officer of CBD Capital\nGroup.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what starts to cut out value for a lot of data sets that clients on\nthe buy-side are looking at,\u201d Selbert said.\n\nInvestors also need to take into account the \u201cother kinds of market data,\nincluding alternative data\u201d that they have access to-and as the field of\nalternative data continues to grow, investors have more choices than ever\nbefore.\n\n## \"Garbage in, garbage out\": different data is relevant to different\nindustries\n\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that not every piece of data or\ninformation is appropriate for work or investments in every sector.\n\nFor example, Daniela Andreevska, Marketing Director at Mashvisor, a real\nestate data analytics company, said that in her industry, \u201cthe importance of\nthe use of big data, predictive analytics, and AI is constantly growing when\nit comes to real estate investing decisions\u201d\n\n\u201c Investors want to base their investment decisions not only on the past\nperformance of rental properties (traditional analytics) but also on their\nexpected performance in the future (predictive analytics). Of course, this\nfuture expected performance is heavily based on trends in past performance as\nwell as trends in the general real estate and housing market.\u201d\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/daniela.jpg)Daniela Andreevska, Marketing Director at\nMashvisor, a real estate data analytics company.\n\nDavid Metzler, chief executive officer of CBD Capital Group, a Venture Capital\nGroup focused on acquiring small to medium cannabidiol (CBD) companies in the\nUS, shared that his company \u201clicensed 40M+ e-commerce data points to create a\ncohort to compare our prospective acquisitions against.\u201d\n\n\u201c[ \u2026]We [also] used a MOS healthcare study that was created by the Rand\nCorporation all the major health insurers use,\u201d he added. \u201cThis gives us a\nunique ability to use this data to acquire companies with products that\nstatistically have efficacy on customers and thereby is a proxy for customer\nrepurchase rates and loyalty (if the products work in the eyes of their\ncustomers, they will buy again).\"\n\nAs for the cryptocurrency industry, David Bakke suggested that \u201cwhat you want\nto look at in terms of data is profits and losses posted by users (which could\nbe a challenge to find, I might add); sales and purchases (a little bit easier\nto uncover), and yields.\u201d\n\nWith all of that said, you\u2019d really be better off using any one of a number of\ncrypto portfolio tools,\u201d such as TradingView, he added.\n\nUltimately, though, Haresh Patel said that \u201cgood decision making is only as\ngood as the data at hand\u2014as the old adage goes: garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\n\u201cWith the sheer amount of data available today, it takes a constant, company-\nwide commitment to data ingestion, cleansing, and quality controls, along with\na solid understanding of what data will be most critical in facilitating\nsmart, fast investment decisions.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Investing+in+2020%3A+Exploring+AI%2C+Machine+Learning%2C+%26+Alt+Data+https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/investing-in-2020-exploring-ai-machine-learning-alt-data/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/investing-in-2020-exploring-ai-machine-learning-alt-data/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/investing-in-2020-exploring-ai-machine-learning-alt-data/&title=Investing+in+2020%3A+Exploring+AI%2C+Machine+Learning%2C+%26+Alt+Data&source=https://www.financemagnates.com \"Share This\")\n  * [Telegram Finance Magnates Telegram Channel](https://t.me/share/url?text=Investing+in+2020%3A+Exploring+AI%2C+Machine+Learning%2C+%26+Alt+Data&url=https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/investing-in-2020-exploring-ai-machine-learning-alt-data/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](mailto:?subject=You\u2019re going to love it: Investing in 2020: Exploring AI, Machine Learning, & Alt Data&body=Check out this article from Finance Magnates: https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/investing-in-2020-exploring-ai-machine-learning-alt-data/ \"Share this\")\n\nTags:[artificial intelligence](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/artificial-\nintelligence/) / [crypto](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/crypto/) /\n[data](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/data/) / [data\nanalytics](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/data-analytics/) /\n[investing](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/investing/)\n\nGot a news tip?

Legal Fees\n\nBy [Meg McEvoy](mailto:mmcevoy@bloomberglaw.com)\n\nJune 18, 2019, 2:51 PM\n\nListen\n\nThe state of alternative fee arrangements in the legal marketplace is in flux.\nAdoption of AFAs by law firms is on the rise as more firms acknowledge client\ndemand for the pricing models. Yet there\u2019s no question that law firms\u2019\naccounting, compensation, and income structures\u2014indeed, their very sense of\nthemselves as businesses\u2014are still built upon hourly billing. Some clients,\ntoo, are staying anchored to the billable hour by requesting \u201cshadow bills,\u201d\neven when under an AFA.\n\nIn addition, there is no widely-adopted technology that assists law firms with\nprice modeling. And, with wide variances in data collection and analysis on\nmatter pricing, it\u2019s unclear whether the market is moving very swiftly toward\nthe \u201cutopia\u201d of uniform pricing for similar legal matters.\n\nIn short, AFAs are growing, but the billable hour\u2014and the long shadow it\ncasts\u2014is alive and well.\n\n[Part 1](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-law-\nfirms-respond-to-demand-for-alt-fee-models) in this two-part series discussed\nresults from Bloomberg Law\u2019s Legal Operations & Technology Survey showing the\nrelatively low adoption of alternative fee arrangements by law firms, as well\nas shifting definitions of AFAs.  \n\n## Advertising AFAs\n\nLaw firms increasingly are promoting their use of AFAs, including publicizing\nstats on their percentage of matters handled under an AFA.  \n\n![](https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/a90e93b/2147483647/resize/633x10000%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-\nbna-\nbrightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F84%2F92a4be6e4483aa07f06451081c5c%2Famlaw-\nwebsite-mentions-pie.png)\n\n74% of the AmLaw 100 mentions \u201calternative fee arrangements\u201d on their\nwebsites, either plugging their use of AFAs or engaging in marketing or\nthought leadership on the subject. Google hits ranged from detailed pages on\nfirm pricing approaches to mere mentions of AFAs.\n\nFirms may have an incentive to take the initiative on AFAs.\n\nA 2016 Altman Weil Law Firms in Transition Report\n[showed](http://www.altmanweil.com/LFiT2016/) that 28% of law firms\nproactively initiated AFAs, while 72% were reactive. 84% of the proactive\nfirms reported that AFA projects are \u201cas profitable\u201d or \u201cmore profitable\u201d than\nhourly-billed projects. Only 51% of reactive firms agreed that AFAs were as or\nmore profitable.\n\nAccording to David Fries, chief profitability officer at Orrick, most of the\nfirm\u2019s largest clients have at least some portion of their work performed\nunder AFAs, and in total a little more than a third of the firm\u2019s work is\nunder AFAs.\n\nThirty percent of Reed Smith\u2019s billing arrangements are under an AFA or value-\nbased billing model, according to Suzanne Hawkins, the firm\u2019s global director\nof client value.\n\nHowever, there is some skepticism over whether firms are truly moving towards\nAFAs as aggressively as they say.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of lip-service that\u2019s being paid to the use of AFAs,\nand maybe not as much practical use of AFAs in some of those firms,\u201d Nicole\nAuerbach, founding partner of ElevateNext, a law firm aligned with law company\nElevate Services, and Valorem Law, an alternative-fee-arrangement-based law\nfirm based in Chicago.\n\n\u201c100% AFAs is [ElevateNext\u2019s] business dream,\u201d Auerbach said. \u201cRight now, the\nmajority of our work is on AFAs, but in reality, we will not turn away work if\na client has not yet gotten their arms around the alternative fee or has opted\nnot to use an AFA. Alternative fees take some getting used to.\u201d  \n\n## The Billable Anchor\n\nEven law firms that publicize their AFA use may be heavily dependent upon\nbillable hour models to create price estimates.\n\n\u201cOur experience is that large firms or midsize firms that are billing using\nalternative fee arrangements are backing into it using a billable hour model\nthat takes estimated hours spent and then adds a cushion for error,\u201d Auerbach\nsaid. \u201cAll of the billing systems and compensation structures in traditional\nlaw firms are based on the billable hour model, so that makes [doing value-\nbased AFAs] really difficult.\u201d\n\nFries doesn\u2019t necessarily see billable-based pricing as antithetical to\nefficiency and risk-sharing: \u201cI believe there is a growing convergence between\nwhat people would call traditional hourly billing and AFAs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, clients are developing an informed view of what things should\ncost and what they think is a fair price,\u201d Fries said. \u201cIn most circumstances,\nequating traditional hourly billing with the client is going to pay you\nwhatever you have on the clock is a misnomer. [Even where a firm hasn\u2019t agreed\nto a cap] if your fees aren\u2019t within market, most of the risk of overage is\nprobably still going to be on the law firm.\u201d\n\nOther pricing experts believe billable hours will continue to play a key role\nin matter pricing.\n\n\u201cI am a proponent of the belief that the billable hour will likely persist for\nthe foreseeable future, because where there are ill-defined or poorly\nunderstood needs at the outset, the hourly rate remains the simplest way to\nbuy complex expertise,\u201d Jae Um, director of pricing strategy at Baker\nMcKenzie, said.  \n\n## Shadow Billing\n\nAnother reflection that billable hours are a hard habit to kick: some\ncompanies paying for legal work under an AFA may still ask for copies of\nattorney and professional hours spent on a matter, a practice known as \u201cshadow\nbilling.\u201d\n\nAFA proponents seem to universally abhor the practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re vehemently opposed to that and we don\u2019t do it. It defeats the purpose,\u201d\nAuerbach said. \u201cThere is a massive amount of time that is spent going line-by-\nline, looking through bills. That is not the best use of an attorney\u2019s, or a\nparalegal\u2019s, or even an admin\u2019s time. Clients should know what their attorneys\nare doing, they should trust them to get the outcomes that they\u2019re wanting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne item that I have been vocal about is shadow billing,\u201d Fries said. \u201cThere\nare companies out there that are saying, on the one hand, that firms need to\nmove away from the billable hour and do more valued based and fixed fee\npricing, but they still want firms to produce invoices as if they were hourly\nbilling and make a line item adjustment. There is no doubt in my mind that\nshadow billing gets in the way of driving innovation and change. I many of the\nleading in-house legal operations chiefs agree and have been equally vocal.\u201d\n\nOther legal pricing professionals say their clients who are under AFAs don\u2019t\nask to see the hourly bills.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard from the market is that our in-house department clients\ndon\u2019t believe in shadow billing. They don\u2019t see the utility and the value of\nit,\u201d Josh Kalmus, vice president of sales for legal billing technology\nprovider PERSUIT, said. \u201cHours can be manipulated to reflect a certain\noutcome. Law firms are smart and can make the numbers work in their favor to\nshow that they\u2019re delivering value [over the billable hour]. Trying to discern\nvalue on an AFA basis based on shadow billing is probably not the best way to\nmeasure value.\u201d\n\nBut, shadow billing is a reflection that despite demands for greater\nefficiency, there can be client-side resistance to fully transitioning to\nAFAs.\n\n\u201cAFAs, especially when you\u2019re first setting out to try them, are more work,\nmore effort, and take more time to manage than hourly rates. Because it\u2019s\nsomething new and the operating environment was not designed [for AFAs],\u201d Um\nsaid. \u201cMore and more people are sharing experiential knowledge and insights,\nand I think that we are all getting a more realistic view of what it takes to\nmake that kind of shift to the revenue and business model work.\u201d  \n\n## Tech Tools\n\nThere is currently no widely adopted software used by law firms to recommend\nand structure fee arrangements based upon user inputs.\n\nBloomberg Law\n[reported](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/exp_blp/ewogICAgImN0eHQiOiAiRE9DIiwKICAgICJpZCI6ICJYRE01TTNCMDAwMDAwMD9yZXNvdXJjZV9pZD05ZTc4MmNjYTg1ZDBlZjM0NDM3YjMxNzYwYzQ2OTFmMCIsCiAgICAic2lnIjogIlU0ckY3RjVxQ1wvVjRQWFNwSzJzcnZUUHdWNE09IiwKICAgICJ0aW1lIjogIjE1NjAzNDgyMzEiLAogICAgInV1aWQiOiAiMmVFSm5tcVQ3VFpvc3RFVkhUNjNodz09ZndOd1pOTVJ2alk5XC9uQ2N1cDNjTXc9PSIsCiAgICAidiI6ICIxIgp9Cg==?emc=BLAW:246417069:0)\nthat legal technology provider Intapp has developed a price modeling tool for\nlaw firms, with six early adopter firm clients. Intapp\u2019s vice president for\nproduct strategy and product management Jose Lazares told Bloomberg Law it has\nabout nine competitors for its pricing software.\n\nLegal billing technology provider PERSUIT\u2019s software works on the in-house\nside. The software allows clients to request information and proposals from\nlaw firms. Firms respond to a fixed set of questions, and clients can compare\nproposals side-by-side.\n\n\u201cOften, clients will run a two-phase process, starting with a request for\ninformation, which helps define the scope and assumptions on what a legal\nmatter will involve,\u201d Kalmus said.\n\n\u201cIt has been a challenge when in-house departments simply say \u2018Hey law firms,\ngive us a fixed fee.\u2019 You need to set those strict assumptions in order to\nmake it easy for your law firm to provide that fixed fee,\u201d Kalmus said.\n\nIn-house departments can also run \u201creverse-options\u201d on law firm\nproposals\u2014essentially, a last call for lowest bid that gives firms a short,\nfixed period of time to respond. PERSUIT clients can save 30% on fixed fee\nprices for legal work by running reverse options, according to Kalmus.\n\nFirms are also developing their own software to assist with price modeling.\n\n\u201cWe have internally developed software that helps set both the budgeting and\nan AFA and it looks at certain firm measures\u201d such as historical matter data\non type, scope, and number of hours, Hawkins said. \u201cWe have some requirements\ninternally that AFAs and fee arrangements are looked at very closely,\nparticularly if a matter is over a certain dollar amount.\u201d\n\nElevateNext is working with Elevate\u2019s invoice review and legal spend analysis\ntechnology to develop AFA-oriented legal technology. \u201cWe use decision trees on\na regular basis both to do early case assessments for matters and throughout a\nmatter,\u201d Auerbach said. \u201cBut in terms of a piece of software that we can plug\nin and establish: this is what we think the AFA should be\u2014we do not use that,\nin large part, because it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some off-the-shelf systems that are designed to input budgets,\ncapture actuals to budget and other information on the back end, and to do all\ntypes of dashboarding,\u201d Fries said. \u201cMany of the larger law firms have built\nmany parts of those systems over the years and have tied those systems to a\nvariety of other databases and tools. For those firms, implementing a new\nsystem would be a massive migration and challenging to do. And ultimately you\nstill need to make sure the data\u2019s good.\u201d  \n\n## Data Ideal vs. Data Reality\n\nLegal industry Utopians might envision a world in which legal work is\nappropriately priced based upon sound analysis of pertinent data points about\na matter. In theory, if enough data is gathered uniformly across enough legal\nmatters over time, an analysis of that data should produce an \u201cideal\u201d pricing\nmodel.\n\n\u201cThe nirvana for corporate legal departments would be to be able to say,\n\u2018based on this particular matter, in this jurisdiction, this is what we call,\nthe \u2018should cost\u2019 model, based on our data set.\u2019 And when you start bench\nmarking that to industry data, then to be able to say: \u2018Ok not only does our\ndata set say this is what we\u2019ve paid for these 10 types of work in this\njurisdiction, but this is what people like us have also paid,\u2019\u201d Kalmus said.\nPERSUIT partnered with CLOC (the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium) last\nyear to put some best practice templates onto their platform and hope to\nevolve their suite of templates to get consistency and uniformity for pricing\nfor legal matters.\n\nThis won\u2019t be so simple, according to Fries.\n\n\u201cThere is unquestionably an enormous amount of data out there. But much of it\nis not adequately structured to do the sophisticated types of analysis that\nfirms would like to do,\u201d Fries said.\n\nFries said he has heard of similar data structure issues on the client side.\n\u201cLaw firms and clients are all over the place in terms of the quality of data\nthey have and the resources and skill sets they have to execute in this area.\nThere\u2019s a lot of garbage in, garbage out,\u201d Fries said.\n\nIn Fries\u2019 opinion, tech tools are improving but they won\u2019t be a blanket\nsolution for price modeling anytime soon.\n\n\u201cMachine learning and AI are getting better, and it is helping both firms and\nclients in the pricing arena. But, in general, in much of the legal tech world\naround AI and data analysis, the marketing is still well out in front of where\nthe actual products are,\u201d Fries said.\n\nAuerbach is more optimistic about data\u2019s potential to right-size pricing for\nlegal tasks. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a long way out, but it shouldn\u2019t be. Companies\nare gathering so much data, even if they\u2019re using a billing system that\ngathers a lot of information,\u201d Auerbach said. \u201cThere are different anomalies,\nbut you can account for that in the data.\u201d  \n\n## The Future\n\nPricing and profitability professionals agree that AFAs are here to stay and\nadoption needs to grow.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to do more with less in the billable hour model once you get\nbelow, let\u2019s say, a 10% discount, which is a pretty uniform discount that\nfirms are willing to give,\u201d Auerbach said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way to get to\nwhere we need to without looking at technology, project management,\nconsulting, best practices, and AFAs are very much a big part of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [the market will] continue to see greater demand for cost-certainty\nand alignment of interests.

Turkus](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/atr/qkR/s4/brandon-\nturkus1.jpg) ](/info/team/brandon-turkus/)\n\nBy: [Brandon Turkus](/info/team/brandon-turkus/)\n\n##  Audi\u2019s new Tesla alternative looks good, drives well.\n\nVerdict 7.6 / 10\n\nThe [2020 Audi E-Tron](https://www.motor1.com/audi/e-tron/) posits a simple\nquestion: what if you want an EV that isn't a\n[Tesla](https://www.motor1.com/tesla/)? Despite what members of the Cult of\nElon might say, there are reasons for this. Maybe you don't like the company's\nstyling, or its founder, or you just want to be different. Perhaps build\nquality and an established dealer network are high priorities.\n\n## Electrifying Audi:\n\n[ ![audi etron mercedes benz eqc\ncomparison](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_0.jpg) Audi E-Tron\nVs Mercedes-Benz EQC Comparison: Current Contenders\n](https://www.motor1.com/reviews/352762/audi-etron-mercedes-benz-eqc-\ncomparison/)\n\n[ ![2019 audi etron first\ndrive](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/placeholder_1.jpg) 2019 Audi E-Tron\nFirst Drive: A Move For The Mainstream\n](https://www.motor1.com/news/292079/2019-audi-etron-first-drive/)\n\nIn that regard, the Audi E-Tron ticks the right boxes. While\n[Audi](https://www.motor1.com/audi/) falls short of Tesla-beating performance\nor range \u2013 two inarguably important metrics \u2013 the disparity between it and a\nModel X isn't so great that there's a clear-cut case against the Audi.\nPurchasing a high-dollar electric crossover is always going to require a\ndegree of rationalizing. The E-Tron just takes a bit more rationalizing than\nthe equivalent Tesla.\n\n**For more on how _Motor1.com_ rates cars, [click\nhere](https://www.motor1.com/news/300338/motor1-star-rating-boilerplate/).**\n\nDesign \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 8/10\n\nCredit to Audi for building an EV without feeling the need to figuratively\nshout it from the rooftop with some extreme piece of design. By and large, the\nE-Tron is just a better looking [Q8](https://www.motor1.com/audi/q8/). We\nprefer its neater grille, which features silver highlights instead of the Q8's\nangry, black design. The headlights are tidier too, with less visual mass on\nthe bottom section.\n\nIn back, a vehicle-spanning LED strip ties together the slim taillights.\nAgain, this is a cleaner, more restrained look compared to the Q8, which adds\na thick black bar underneath its lighting element. By virtue of its emphasis\non aerodynamics, the E-Tron's bumper, with its silver-painted accents, is more\nrestrained than the Q8, which features prominent exhaust outlets for its gas-\npowered engine.\n\nThe E-Tron's cabin adopts the glass-cockpit look featured in the Q8, as well\nas the [A6](https://www.motor1.com/audi/a6/),\n[A7](https://www.motor1.com/audi/a7/), and\n[A8](https://www.motor1.com/audi/a8/). There are three displays \u2013 a 12.3-inch\ndigital instrument cluster, a 10.1-inch touchscreen at the top of the center\nstack, and an 8.8-inch touchscreen below the main display but ahead of the\ngear selector \u2013 and each features impressively pretty graphics. Beyond that,\nthe interior's design is clean and minimalistic with handsome matte wood and\nsubtle silver accents. Our favorite interior touch, though, is the steering\nwheel, which has a nifty four-spoke design that mimics the yoke of an\nairplane. It's very cool.\n\nComfort \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 9/10\n\nLike most EVs, the E-Tron offers excellent noise, vibration, and harshness\ncontrol, owing to the silent propulsion system. Without the engine noise\n(aside from the simulated audio note of the pedestrian warning system), the\nE-Tron is impressively quiet in urban conditions, shrugging off impacts from\nroad imperfections and the roar of its low-rolling-resistance tires. At higher\nspeeds, the sound of the wind rarely interrupts the serene cabin experience.\n\nIn addition to that plus, the E-Tron does all the comfort-focused things other\nAudis do so well. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, whether\ndicing down a canyon road or cruising down the freeway. There's enugh range of\nadjustability in the seat, although our tester's optional massage function\nhardly seems like a conducive use of the E-Tron's electrons. Forward\nvisibility is solid, and the blind spots are minimal. The second-row bench is\nroomy for two adults, with plenty of leg and shoulder room. As with most\nvehicles this size, we'd advise against adding a third full-grown human to the\nmix, although it's doable over short distances.\n\nThere's ample cargo space \u2013 28.5 cubic feet with the seats up and 57 cubes\nwith the second row folded. That means only a minor sacrifice from the Q8,\nwhich has 2.0 and 3.7 more cubes, respectively. The cargo floor is pretty\nhigh, though, so loading and unloading isn't always that easy. A standard air\nsuspension helps matters. In the cabin, meanwhile, there's plenty of space for\nstuff, with sizable door pockets and a giant cubby in the center console. We\nlike this touch, but wish Audi offered a way to cover it up, to better hide\nvaluables.\n\nPerformance & Handling \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 5/10\n\nNo, the Audi E-Tron is not as quick as a Tesla Model X. It's not as quick as a\n[Jaguar I-Pace](https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/i-pace/) or [Mercedes-Benz\nEQC](https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/eqc/), either. Set to its most\naggressive drive mode, Dynamic, the [E-Tron can scoot to 60 in a relaxed 5.5\nseconds](https://insideevs.com/features/374620/top-ten-quickest-evs/). That is\nunquestionably slow in a world where the most affordable Tesla Model X can hit\n60 in 4.4 seconds.\n\nBut particularly for a customer that's only driven gas-powered cars, the\nimmediacy of the E-Tron's 414 pound-feet (up to 490 lb-ft in Boost mode, which\ncomes in automatically when Dynamic mode is active) is eye-opening, especially\nwhen deploying the torque in bursts rather than in sustained acceleration.\nWhile performance fades with the pedal held down, a sudden blast \u2013 like when\ntrying to shoot a gap in traffic \u2013 reveals the powertrain to be suitably\npunchy. Still, anyone who has experienced the extreme performance of a Tesla\nproduct will find this EV lacking. Hopefully, [Audi's RS line will get a\ncrack](https://www.motor1.com/news/351895/audi-e-tron-quattro-s/) at the all-\nelectric game and introduce a variant with more aggressive acceleration.\n\nOverall straight-line performance might be lacking, but there's a real\nlikability here, especially around town. There are no histrionics in how the\nE-Tron accelerates. Its single-speed automatic is unobtrusive and eager to\nengage, even from a standstill. The only real issue is that it's so much\nslower than its competitors.\n\nA big part of that is down to weight, though. At around 5,500 pounds (Audi\nstill hasn't published weight figures), the E-Tron is heavier than the\nMercedes EQC and the Model X Long Range despite both having larger, heavier\nbatteries. That mass has a negative impact on handling, although as expected,\nhandling in the real-world conditions of metropolitan Detroit is better than\non the twisting Californian roads we first experienced it. Our rating reflects\nthat point, calling the E-Tron neither above or below average on a handling\nfront.\n\nThe brakes operate like a lot of EVs, in that in many conditions, the physical\nbrakes don't come into play unless you need to come to a complete stop.\nInstead, the electric motors slow the car and recuperates energy in the\nprocess, a typically smooth, predictable practice. But when we really dug into\nthe brake pedal and triggered the physical calipers/rotors, there was a\nnoticeable shudder as the car realized it needed more stopping power than the\nmotor could provide. This disconcerting sensation only cropped up when we were\nactively testing the braking.\n\nTechnology & Connectivity \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 9/10\n\nAudi remains one of the premiere brands for in-car technology and the E-Tron\nis a reminder of that fact. The two-screen infotainment setup is excellent,\noffering attractive graphics and impressive responsiveness. The menus are a\nlittle dense, but the learning curve isn't egregiously steep. There's also an\nimpressive level of reconfigurability, so owners can optimize the layout of\nthe upper screen based on their needs. The E-Tron ticks the box with advanced\nequipment, too, offering wireless charging, a gorgeous digital instrument\ncluster, and a wireless hotspot. There's even a nifty toll collection system,\nso you won't need to attach a stupid box to your windshield for driving on\ntoll roads.\n\nAll of those things come standard. On top of the infotainment and advanced\ntech, the E-Tron's standard equipment list ticks all the right boxes. Heated\nand ventilated front seats, LED headlights, an air suspension, a Bang and\nOlufsen audio system, a surround-view camera system, and four-zone climate\ncontrol are all standard on the base E-Tron. That's a solid suite of gear.\n\nThe other main options are a $650 Towing package that allows the E-Tron to tow\nup to 4,000 pounds and a $900 Cold Weather package, which adds heated outboard\nrear seats, heated windshield washer jets, and an enhanced in-cabin heater and\npreconditioner.\n\nSafety \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 9/10\n\nThe E-Tron offers [the entirety of Audi's active safety\nsuite](https://insideevs.com/news/365255/audi-etron-quattro-top-iihs/) at no\nadditional cost on the base model. It's standard on our Prestige tester.\nStandouts include full-speed adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency\nbraking, blind-spot monitoring with a vehicle exit sensor, traffic sign\nrecognition, and lane departure warning with lane centering. And these systems\nwork extremely well.\n\nOn the freeway, the active safety is proactive without feeling intrusive. You\ncan drive, and just let the systems work in the background, gently nudging you\nback towards the center of a lane, braking the car gently, and applying\nthrottle without leaning too hard on the battery. This is a very likable,\nusable suite of technology. Along with the LED headlights, the E-Tron is an\nimpressively safe vehicle.\n\nFuel Economy \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 7/10\n\nWith an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of [74 miles per gallon\nequivalent](https://insideevs.com/reviews/343797/audi-e-tron-disappoints-on-\nenergy-consumption-places-last-among-evs/), the E-Tron might be an EV, but\nit\u2019s not especially efficient. A Jaguar I-Pace is mildly more efficient, at 76\nmpge, while the top-rung Tesla Model X with 22-inch wheels returns 79 mpge \u2013\nthe most efficient Model X will do 101 mpge combined.\n\nThe E-Tron\u2019s range is also disappointing relative to the Model X, [at 204\nmiles per charge](https://insideevs.com/audi-e-tron-electric-range-epa/). It\nclaws back some praise with its impressive 150-kilowatt charge rate, though.\nDuring testing, an Electrify America DC fast charger took our E-Tron from 35\npercent of charge to just over 80 percent in 17 minutes.\n\nIn terms of energy consumption, our tester returned a computer indicated 2.2\nmiles per kilowatt-hour. That's pretty much spot on with its EPA estimated\nefficiency, which is to say it's disappointing in 2019. Frankly, the E-Tron's\n95-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack is ample, but the vehicle it\u2019s\nattached to is just too \u201cthirsty\u201d and too heavy.\n\nPricing \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 \u2800 6/10\n\nThe Audi E-Tron Premium Plus starts at $74,800, while our range-topping\nPrestige kicks off at $81,800. Those prices don't reflect [a $7,500 federal\nincome tax credit](https://insideevs.com/news/347490/audi-e-tron-incentives/).\nOur tester was pretty much loaded, adding $595 Glacier White paint, $1,500\n21-inch wheels, and the $900 Cold Weather package. All told, our test model\nsat at $84,795. That's a dear sum, especially compared to some of the\ncompetition.\n\nThe most obvious is the Tesla Model X, which, at $84,990 for the Long Range\nmodel is a smidge more expensive while offering significantly more range. A\nmax of 325 miles is hard to ignore as is a run to 60 that's done over a full\nsecond quicker than the E-Tron. But where the Audi is essentially loaded at\n$85,000, the Model X can climb higher, even if those options are things the\nE-Tron can't match, like a six- or seven-seat layout. Tesla offers its\nimpressive Autopilot system standard, although there\u2019s a premium for its most\nadvanced active safety gear \u2013 the $6,000 Full-Self Driving Capability (it's\nnot full-self driving, kids, that doesn't exist) is definitely more advanced\nthan what Audi is offering, though.\n\nThe other rival, at least until the Mercedes-Benz EQC400 arrives, is the\nJaguar I-Pace. An excellent driver's EV, it has a lower starting price at\n$69,500. It's also faster, taking 4.5 seconds to hit 60, and offers more range\nwith 234 miles to a charge. The Jag's customizability is also welcome, with\nthree separate trim levels, a range of packages, and a broad palette of wheel\nand color options. That said, while the I-Pace is more affordable (even the\nrange-topping model undercuts the loaded E-Tron by around $4,000), its active\nsafety suite feels neither as expansive nor as competent in daily use. Its\ninability to charge at a rate above 100 kilowatts is also a significant\nshortcoming that'd have us considering the Audi first.\n\n### Competitors:\n\n  * **[Jaguar

Nielsen data from August show 98% of people who\nbuy meat alternatives also buy meat.  \n  \nBut whether people are choosing so-called alt-meats for ethical or health\nreasons, they should be careful to compensate for the loss of nutrients,\nexperts say. That goes double for people moving away from animal products\nentirely.  \n  \n\"You do have to be more intentional about it,\" said Jo Ann Carson, a retired\nprofessor of clinical nutrition at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\"People can easily find protein elsewhere, but if they're not having any\nanimal products - if they're not having any dairy, meat or eggs - they might\nhave a hard time getting enough grams of protein in the foods they're eating.\"  \n  \nFor example, regular tofu contains about 8 grams of protein per 100 grams,\naccording to the USDA. The same amount of ground beef includes about 19 grams\nof protein, and ground chicken contains about 17 grams. Federal dietary\nguidelines recommend 10% to 35% of daily calories come from protein. That's\nequivalent to 46 grams of protein a day for adult women and 56 grams for adult\nmen.  \n  \nBut there's more to meat consumption than just protein.  \n  \n\"Iron from beef is very well absorbed, but plant iron not so much so,\" said\nMary Ellen Camire, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the\nUniversity of Maine. \"The big thing is vitamin B12 because you can only get\nthat from animal products or supplements. So for some people, that is a risk\nfactor. They may be at risk for developing anemia.\"  \n  \nMore processing used  \nAccording to restaurant consulting group Baum+Whiteman, 31% of Americans\npractice meat-free days, and 83% say they're adding plant-based foods to their\ndiets to improve health and nutrition. But in the case of many alternative\nmeats, perception may not mirror reality.  \n  \n\"Using vegetable-based meat substitutes, you typically are eating food that is\nmore processed,\" Carson said. \"I don't think we know all of the ramifications\nof that.\"  \n  \nPeople should be aware of the tradeoffs if they choose meat alternatives for\nhealth reasons, Camire said.  \n  \n\"A lot of them are designed so that they are more comparable to some of the\nmore structured proteins, but they're a blessing and a curse,\" Camire said.\n\"It might have as much protein as the real meat, but it probably has a lot\nmore sodium, and it may even have more saturated fat.  \n  \n\"Some of the fake burgers are actually putting little globs of coconut fat in\nthere to make it juicy when you bite into it.\"  \nAccording to news reports, many new meat substitutes smell, feel and even\n\"bleed\" like meat because they are genetically engineered or highly processed.  \n  \n\"It's a little bit ironic today, when everyone is wanting clean labels, that\nsome of these meat alternatives actually have a lot of additives in them,\"\nCamire said.  \n  \nStrive for balance  \nBeans and legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and soybeans can be a healthy\nalternative to meat, she said. In addition to protein, they are good sources\nof other nutrients such as fiber and iron.  \n  \nIn general, as with most dietary choices, the key is to strive for a balance\nbetween animal products, fruits, vegetables and other dietary choices that\nsatisfy nutrition requirements, Camire said.  \n  \nBut that's challenging, she added, because \"moderation and variety are not\nsexy topics.\"\n\n## Never miss a story\n\nChoose the plan that's right for you.  \nDigital access or digital and print delivery.\n\n[Subscribe\nNow](https://www.jacksonville.com/subscribenow?g2i_source=jacksonville.com&g2i_medium=subscribe&g2i_campaign=footer)\n\n## Sign up for daily e-mails\n\n#### Site Services __\n\n  * [Support Local Businesses](https://supportlocal.usatoday.com)\n  * [My Profile](http://myprofile.jacksonville.com/)\n  * [Live Chat](https://www.jacksonville.com/subscribe-manage)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.jacksonville.com/contact)\n  * [e-Edition](http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/floridatimesunion)\n  * [NIE](https://www.nieonline.com/floridacoast/)\n  * [Manage My Subscription](https://ssl.subscribehome.com/cgi-bin/morris/custservice/web/login.html?siteid=JAXTU)\n  * [Manage My Digital Subscription](https://www.jacksonville.com/subscribe-manage)\n\n#### Submissions __\n\n  * [Announcements](https://www.jacksonville.com/send-us-your-news)\n  * [Calendar Event](https://www.jacksonville.com/calendar)\n  * [Obituaries](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/)\n  * [Legal Notices](http://www.marketplaceadsonline.com/marketplace/fljac/category/Announcements/Legals)\n\n#### Advertising __\n\n  * [Advertise with Us](http://www.timesunionmedia.com)\n  * [Classifieds](http://www.marketplaceadsonline.com/marketplace/fljac)\n  * [Place an Ad](http://adportal.marketplaceadsonline.com/gatehouse-adportal/fljac-classified/index.html)\n  * [Circulars](https://www.jacksonville.com/circulars)\n  * [Business Directory](http://local.jacksonville.com)\n  * [PR Link](http://jacksonville.live.communityq.com/)\n  * [Pay Your Ad Bill](https://www.jacksonville.com/pay-your-ad-bill)\n\n#### Stay Connected __\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FLTimesUnion)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jaxdotcom)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jaxdotcom/?hl=en)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/jaxdotcom/videos)\n  * [RSS](https://www.jacksonville.com/section/feed)\n\n(C) Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.

World first: Vaping product now in pharmacies\n\n**Monday, 21 October 2019, 3:57 pm**  \n**Press Release:[Alt New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Alt_New_Zealand)**\n\nMonday, 21 October 2019\n\n  \n\n### ![](http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1910/d951694f24a343699f67.jpeg)\n\n  \n\nBelieved to be a world-first, a vaping system branded specifically for the\nhealthcare sector is now available in many pharmacies throughout New Zealand.\n\nThe off-the-shelf product, branded Vapix, is marketed to smokers over 18 years\nof age, encouraging them to \u2018Make The Switch\u2019.\n\nIts Kiwi owners and developers say getting a high-quality vaping product into\npharmacies is well overdue. The move has also been welcomed by many in the\nhealth sector.\n\nExclusive to Unichem and Life Pharmacy, the Vapix system is packaged to\ninclude a battery and capsule with an option of flavours, nicotine or non-\nnicotine. The smoking cessation product is now available in the majority of\n360 Unichem and Life Pharmacy stores nationwide.\n\nVapix is the brainchild of the country\u2019s largest vaping company, Alt New\nZealand. It is thought to be the only vaping product developed for pharmacy\nand healthcare purposes in the world.\n\nAlt New Zealand co-owners, Ben Pryor and Jonathan Devery, say the\nopportunities to also dispense traditional medicines via the mechanism of\nvaping are limitless. They are now investigating other medical purposes for\nvaping beyond smoking cessation.\n\nTheir New Zealand-registered company, Myriad Pharmaceuticals, was established\nlast year to develop Vapix and assess other opportunities.\n\nMyriad\u2019s chief scientist, Eliana Golberstein, says in this current unregulated\nmarket no therapeutic claims can be made about vaping, albeit Government\nregulations are now imminent. Regardless, Myriad is conducting clinical trials\nwith the aim of Vapix one day gaining registration as a Medsafe-approved\nmedicine.\n\nOwner of Unichem All Seasons Pharmacy in West Auckland, Marie Bennett, now\nstocks Vapix. In recent years, smokers wanting to quit have increasingly\nvisited her pharmacy making enquiries about vaping. She says Vapix is stocked\nstrictly as a smoking cessation tool and sold only to adult smokers attempting\nto quit.\n\n\u201cAs the Ministry of Health makes clear, vaping is an effective tool to support\nsmokers to quit tobacco and it is less harmful than smoking. We are pleased to\nprovide smokers with the Vapix option, ensuring we now have a full suite of\noptions for smokers keen to give up. Without doubt vaping has helped a lot of\nKiwis quit smoking,\u201d says Ms Bennett.\n\nShe says pharmacists supplying Vapix closely follow the Pharmacy Council\u2019s\nguidance statement which sits alongside Ministry of Health guidelines.\n\nMr Pryor says the launch of Vapix reinforces vaping\u2019s critical role in\nreducing New Zealand\u2019s smoking rates and its growing acceptance by healthcare\nprofessionals as a trusted alternative.\n\nHe says recent University of Auckland research involving 1,124 adult New\nZealanders motivated to quit smoking has been compelling for many. Released\nlast month, the large study concluded that using nicotine-based vapes in\ncombination with nicotine patches proved the most effective way for\nparticipants to become smoke-free after six months\n\n\u201cAssociate Minister of Health, Jenny Salesa, is set to introduce vaping\nlegislation which may cut nicotine levels and get rid of most flavours. The\nfact that New Zealand\u2019s largest pharmacies are now stocking Vapix, offering\nboth nicotine and flavour options, says a lot about what actually works,\u201d says\nBen Pryor\n\nVapix is available in Gold Tobacco and Menthol Ice flavours\n\nAsthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ has recently come out, publicly backing\npharmacists supplying vapes to smokers trying to quit.\n\nHealth organisations that have an agreed position on vaping being less harmful\nthan smoking and can help smokers to quit, include the Pharmacy Guild of New\nZealand, all District Health Boards, New Zealand Medical Association, and the\nHeart Foundation. Their supporting logos can be found on the Vaping-To-Quit-\nSmoking website launched by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Agency\nthis year.\n\nThe Alt New Zealand co-owners say they will continue to drive their retail\npresence and brands Vapix, Vapo, and Alt to meet customer demand.\n\nVapo now has 11 stores nationwide, with Sylvia Park and NorthWest the latest\nadditions for Auckland, and Nelson now home to the South Island\u2019s second Vapo\nstore.\n\nTheir company remains driven by the prospect of New Zealand one day being\ntobacco-free.\n\n[[www.vapix.co.nz](http://www.vapix.co.nz/)](http://www.vapix.co.nz/)\n\n **Ends**\n\n  \n\n[(C) Scoop Media](http://www.scoop.co.nz/about/terms.html)  \n\n#### Join the Scoop Citizen Community\n\n20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is\nessential to keep Scoop thriving.

changes are afoot at the company formerly known as MarketInvoice.\n\n![MarketInvoice rebrands as MarketFinance as it launches SME lending up to\n\u00a3250k](/images/featured/marketinvoice-rebrands-as-marketfinance-as-it-\nlaunches-sme-lending-up-to-250k.jpg)\n\nImage source: MarketFinance Co-Founders Ilya Kondrashov and Anil Stocker.  \n\nThis morning CEO and Co-Founder [Anil Stocker\n](http://www.altfi.com/people/anil-stocker)announced a sweeping rebrand of his\nbusiness to[ MarketFinance,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/marketinvoice)\nreflecting a suite of new products being launched.\n\nThe newly-named[ MarketFinance\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/marketinvoice)is expanding to offer business\nloans of up to \u00a3250,000 over 3 years, and plans to scale up to facilities\nworth \u00a31m+ in the coming months.\n\n\"This is just a starting point,\" Stocker told _AltFi_. \"We see this growing in\nthe future and are also launching a Corporate Solutions unit with a new team\nwho have the ability to structure multi-product facilities, a combination of\ninvoice finance and loans.\"\n\nCorporate Solutions will offer lending of up to \u00a35m by combining invoice\nfinance and a business loan.\n\n\"To be honest that's only really been done by the banks, we're the first\nfintech to offer both invoice financing and lending beside each other, if you\nlook at [Funding Circle ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/funding-circle)or[\niwoca,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/iwoca) they just offer loans,\" said\nStocker.\n\nLast month Craig Flyger was announced as the newly-promoted Director of this\nCorporate Solutions unit.\n\n\"I think the new brand reflects how we're becoming a lot broader than just\nsingle invoices on our platform,\" Stocker added. \"We thought a lot about when\nwe would do this, and I think the sooner the better because it gives us a lot\nmore breadth to expand our product set.\"\n\nWhile its invoice financing operation is backed by family offices and\ninstitutions,[ MarketFinance's](http://www.altfi.com/companies/marketinvoice)\nnew business lending arm is being financed exclusively by larger institutions.\n\nThe move looks set to put[ MarketFinance\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/marketinvoice)in competition with a number of\nlarger alternative business lenders from [Esme Loans\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/esme-loans)up to [OakNorth\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/oaknorth)on the larger tickets.\n\n### Sign up to the Daily Disruptor Newsletter\n\nYour

options can be added to Defender\n  * Who should buy a paid antivirus product \n\nShow More __\n\nThere, we said it: You don't need to pay for antivirus software anymore.\n[Microsoft\u2019s Windows\nDefender](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3453717/windows-security-av-\nreview.html), a free service that\u2019s built right into Windows 10, is now as\ngood as the paid antivirus/antimalware solutions that have been collecting\nyour money for years.\n\nMany PC users became accustomed to paying for antivirus software for two\nreasons: Good, free alternatives were scarce, and Microsoft offered minimal\nprotection via Windows, ceding the category to Norton, Kaspersky and a host of\nother third-party vendors. Windows\u2019 first antimalware efforts were so abysmal\nthat testing agencies like AV-comparatives.org and AV-test.org used Defender\nas the baseline (i.e., junk) level of performance. In December, 2013, for\nexample, AV-test.org tested how well 23 antivirus vendors blocked real-world\nmalware samples using Windows 8.1. [Microsoft finished dead\nlast](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3025889/tested-microsofts-windows-\ndefender-antivirus-is-less-awful-than-it-used-to-be.html).\n\nThat was then. Over the intervening years, Microsoft started taking endpoint\nsecurity seriously. In 2019, Microsoft\u2019s own Windows Defender Antivirus, built\nright into Windows 10 for free, often outperforms paid services. (Windows now\nlumps Windows Defender Antivirus underneath what it calls Windows Security,\nwhich includes Windows Firewall and other tools.) It\u2019s not perfect: The\nincidence of \u201cfalse positives,\u201d where legitimate apps are mistaken for\nmalware, can be high. One test also noted that it slowed down a low-end PC\nmore than others do. You can decide for yourself: Are these \u201ccosts\u201d more\naffordable than paying $60-plus per year?\n\n[[ Further reading: Our best Windows 10 tricks, tips and tweaks\n]](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2875600/windows/windows-10-the-best-tips-\ntricks-and-tweaks.html)\n\nWe still review [the best antivirus\napps](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/best-antivirus-for-windows-\npc.html), and there are still some reasons why you'd want one, which we'll get\ninto later. But first let's look at how far Windows Defender has come, and how\nwell it could stand on its own as your primary antivirus package.\n\n## Why you should use Windows Defender to protect your PC\n\nTwo separate testing houses, AV-comparatives and AV-test, rank Windows\nDefender nearly at the top of the products both labs have tested.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that antimalware testing is a time-intensive process.\nEven sites like AV-comparatives use automated tests that crawl the web and\nseek out malicious sites and URLs, trying to reproduce real-world scenarios\nthat all of us would encounter in our daily work.\n\nOne key point stood out: In[ AV-comparatives\u2019 test](https://www.av-\ncomparatives.org/tests/real-world-protection-test-february-may-2019/),\nMicrosoft was one of the four vendors (out of a total of sixteen) that didn\u2019t\nallow _any_ malware to take over its test systems. Vendors whose PCs ended up\ncompromised with malware included big names, such as McAfee and Symantec.\n(Malware and protection mechanisms are constantly evolving. AV-comparatives\nran its tests from February through May, 2019, to demonstrate the \u201caverage\u201d\nlevel of protection over time.)\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of AV-comparatives\u2019 findings:\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/av-comparitives-\nsummary-100809185-orig.jpg) [AV-Comparatives.org](https://www.av-\ncomparatives.org/tests/real-world-protection-test-february-may-2019/)\n\nTo be fair, the AV-comparatives test showed a few weaknesses with Windows\nDefender. The tests revealed three \u201cuser-dependent\u201d test cases, where Defender\ndidn\u2019t immediately identify the malware, and asked the user for permission to\ninstall the file. That\u2019s not ideal\u2014users would probably be inclined to allow\nthe malware onto the system. Windows Defender was also unusually heavy-handed\nwith false positives, blocking a massive 74 legitimate apps and services.\n(This is an instance where _your_ own experience can serve as a sounding\nboard. Think back: Has Windows 10\u2019s Windows Defender blocked an app you knew\nto be legitimate?)\n\nFor its part, AV-test ranked Windows Defender as a Top Product in its [June\n2019 antivirus group test](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-\nwindows/windows-10/june-2019/microsoft-windows-defender-4.18-192315/).\nDefender caught every piece of malware the agency threw at it, including every\n\u201czero-day\u201d sample that reproduced real-world testing, with zero false\npositives. AV-test ranked Defender 6 out of 6 for the group test, scores that\nDefender has been at or near for AV-test\u2019s [April roundup](https://www.av-\ntest.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/april-2019/), the [February\nroundup](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-\nwindows/windows-10/february-2019/), and [December 2018](https://www.av-\ntest.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/december-2018/) and [October\n2018 tests](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-\nwindows/windows-10/october-2018/), too.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the AV-test June 2019 roundup:\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/av-test-june-2019-on-\nwindows-defender-100809188-orig.jpg) [AV-test.org](https://www.av-\ntest.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/april-2019/)\n\nIt\u2019s important to reiterate that Defender scored highly (with a perfect score\nin the June update) in terms of zero-day attacks. Historically, that was one\nof the knocks against Defender: Microsoft couldn\u2019t react quickly and\neffectively enough to combat new, emerging attacks. Defender\u2019s repeated\nsuccess in third-party tests proves that Microsoft has overcome these\nobstacles.\n\nAV-test also ranked Defender above the industry average in terms of\nperformance, such as installing apps and copying files, a significant\nimprovement over AV-comparatives\u2019 own test from April, where [Defender\nperformed poorly](https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/performance-test-\napril-2019/) in those same comparisons.\n\nThe UK\u2019s SELabs is yet a third source of antimalware testing, and it, too,\nranked Defender at the top of its list of antimalware solutions. The report\n(available only via a [downloadable\nPDF](https://selabs.uk/download/consumers/epp/2019/jul-sep-2019-home.pdf))\ngave Defender a perfect 100-percent accuracy rating. Of the top antivirus\ntesting agencies, Defender scored three out of three.\n\nMultiple test results make the case that Windows Defender is good enough to\nprotect your PC from viruses and malware. Of course, you should always\npractice safe Internet practices, such as not clicking on unknown links and\nattachments, and not wandering through the dark corners of the web. And don\u2019t\nforget, [Windows Sandbox](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3338084/how-to-use-\nwindows-sandbox-microsoft.html) (added to Windows 10 Pro machines as part of\nthe[ May 2019\nUpdate](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3363697/windows-10-may-2019-update-\nreview.html)) allows you that extra protection in case you _do_ want to\nexplore a risky site or app.\n\n## Great free antivirus options can be added to Defender\n\nOK, maybe you're still not convinced. If you want an extra layer of\nantimalware protection, Defender makes that easier, too.\n\nHistorically, running _two_ antivirus programs was considered a bad idea,\nbecause of potential conflicts. Windows 10 allows you to run whatever\nantimalware program you choose, and optionally leave Defender in place to\nperiodically check for threats as a secondary measure. (Go to _Settings >\nUpdate & Security > Windows Security_, then click on _Virus and threat\nprotection_. Scroll down to _Windows Defender Antivirus options_ and make sure\n_periodic scanning_ is toggled on.)\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/bitdefenderautopilot-100767172-orig.jpg)\nIDG\n\nThere\u2019s a number of free antivirus solutions from which to choose, though\nBitDefender is a preferred choice. (Note that this screen has been taken from\nthe paid security suite.)\n\nHere you have a wealth of free antivirus options, from AVG to Avast to Avira\nand many more. [BitDefender Internet Security\u2019s free\noption](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html), however, is so\neffective and unobtrusive that you\u2019ll forget that it\u2019s there\u2014which, really, is\nwhat you want in an antivirus program that guards your PC. It, too, is rated\nas a [top product by AV-test](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-\nwindows/windows-10/june-2019/bitdefender-internet-security-23.0-192305/) and\n[AV-comparatives](https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/real-world-protection-\ntest-february-may-2019/), though both tested the paid versions. (To our\nknowledge, there is no difference between the paid and free versions in terms\nof anti-malware protection.)\n\nAgain, we\u2019d rate Windows Defender as sufficient protection for everyday use,\nwith Windows\u2019 ability to layer on additional antimalware capabilities as a\nsecurity blanket.\n\n## Who should buy a paid antivirus product\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/01/mcafee-vs-\nnorton-100785239-orig.jpg) Rob Schultz / IDG\n\nEstablished antivirus/antimalware products from McAfee, Symantec, and others\nhave branched out to offer VPNs, password vaults, and other security services.\n\nThe reason why you might still want a paid antivirus and antimalware solution\nis if you want more services, tied up in a neat package. The leaders have\nmoved beyond traditional protections, offering related services such as VPNs,\ncredit monitoring and protection, and online vaults for your passwords and\nother critical documents.\n\nWhile some attackers simply want to crash your system, remember that there\u2019s\nfar more money to be made in [attacks like\nransomware](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3170201/what-happens-if-your-\nthermostat-is-hacked-researchers-name-the-top-7-security-threats.html), which\nencrypt your PC and then demand that you pay for the decryption key. Both\nMalwarebytes and BitDefender, among others, have developed free anti-\nransomware solutions, which again provide a free alternative.\n\nWindows has its own free [protections that help stop\nransomware](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2084002/how-to-rescue-your-pc-\nfrom-ransomware.html), including Windows Defender as well as protected folders\nthat can be locked down and secured. Nothing\u2019s perfect, and no one can say for\nsure that a new attack won\u2019t be able to break Windows\u2019 protections. But that\nargument applies to paid services as well.\n\nAlternatively, you can roll your own a-la-carte security suite, building on\ntop of Windows\u2019 own antimalware service. Seek out your preferred VPN provider\nfrom our [list of best VPNs](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198369/best-vpn-\nservices-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html), for example. Subscribe to LifeLock\nor a credit-monitoring service. Google Chrome and other browsers will manage\nyour passwords, or you can pick from a list of [the best password\nmanagers](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207185/best-password-managers-\nreviews-and-buying-advice.html). What paid antimalware suites offer are vetted\nservices, all rolled up into a neat, manageable package, as well as peace of\nmind.\n\nThat convenience comes with a price, however, one that will hit your wallet\nevery year as part of a recurring subscription. If you want to keep paying for\nthese kinds of services, that\u2019s fine. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to save\nmoney, cutting out your existing paid antivirus subscription in favor of\nWindows Defender is worth a good, hard look.\n\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may\nearn a small commission.

Every single food has meat\ningredients, and we don't have a vegetarian menu in regular restaurants.\"\n\nIn general, new meat alternatives are but \"a curiosity,\" in Korea, she says.\nWhile shoppers can now afford meat there, a growing number are opting for meat\nsubstitutes owing to \"a religious reason, or animal welfare, or environmental\nconcern or sustainability issue.\" But such trends \"are in the initial stage,\"\nshe says.\n\n# Related Articles\n\n[Alt-meat sales rise on new flavors, profiles,\ningredients](/articles/12339-alt-meats-sales-soar-on-new-flavors-profiles-\ningredients)[Taiwan gets a look at alternative beef\ncuts](/articles/12011-taiwan-gets-a-look-at-alternative-beef-cuts)\n\nShe found the retail price of the Beyond Burgers were \"3.5 times more\nexpensive than the price of a (U.S. beef burger) right now,\" and some meals\nfeaturing the patties were priced at USD $30 to $50, far out of range for most\nconsumers.\n\nFurther, she says, ground meat patties \"are not the way we eat beef\" in Korea.\nAnd when Beyond Meat cutlets and nuggets were tasted in a recent trial, \"all\nwere reviewed as a bad smell in cooking and a need to cover up with sauces,\"\nYang said.\n\nMeanwhile, Yuri Barutkin, USMEF's representative in Eastern Europe and Russia,\nsays a lot of Europeans are finding reasons of personal health, animal\nwelfare, food fashion and novelty to dine with meat substitutes. Plus some\ngovernments are pushing meatless diets, and some restaurants add them to menus\nwhen it can mean a premium price, he says.\n\n\"Europe is seen by many as a trends setter in food standards and food\npatterns,\" he says. Generally, \"Europe has embraced the alternative meats.\"\n\n\"But Europe is very different from one part to another,\" Barutkin says. The\nEuropean Union's 28 nations includes countless nationalities, he says, \"and\nthere are 100 nationalities in Russia alone.\" In many areas, income supports\nlimited eating of traditional meat, let alone pricier meat alternatives, and\nenvironmental sustainability is not high in their meat selection criteria, he\npoints out.\n\nOn the global scale, the emergence of meat alternatives is only beginning,\nsaid Glynn Tonsor, a Kansas State University livestock economist who joined\nthe USMEF discussion, and \"more choices in the ground meat space\" are on the\nway.\n\nPricing remains a market barrier, Tonsor said, noting market surveys listing\nplant-based burgers at $7.50 to $12 in the U.S. But in the U.S. and abroad,\nthe products will gain market appeal if and when prices come down, Tonsor\nexpects.\n\nAlso, he says, market growth for the new alternatives doesn't mean less\nsuccess for livestock producers and the conventional meat market, or vice\nversa.\n\n\"It is certainly possible that we can have a growing protein pie in the world,\n(and) I believe that is occurring,\" Tonsor said. \"So one can have smaller\nshare of that protein pie and still have a bigger industry than you had five\nyears ago.\"\n\nMeanwhile, [Allen\nGray](https://ag.purdue.edu/agecon/Pages/Profile.aspx?strAlias=gray&intDirDeptID=4),\na Purdue University agricultural economist also speaking at the conference,\npointed to one [popular\nanalysis](https://www.atkearney.com/retail/article/?/a/how-will-cultured-meat-\nand-meat-alternatives-disrupt-the-agricultural-and-food-industry) that\nprojects vegan meat alternatives will capture 10% of the global meat supply by\n2025 and 25% by 2040, while conventional meat will slide from 90% to 40% over\nthe same period and cultured meat claims 35% of the 2040 market.\n\nGray thinks those projections exaggerate the likely market growth for\nalternatives; the estimates also assumed a 3% annual drop in consumption of\ntraditional meat. He expects markets for traditional meat will instead\ncontinue to grow at 3% to 5% in the coming decades, \"though that leaves room\nfor the alternative meats market to grow as well.\"\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.agri-pulse.com).\n\n![Edmaixnercapitol](//www.agri-\npulse.com/ext/resources/thumb/EdMaixnerCapitol.jpg?1482167569)\n\n[Ed Maixner](mailto:emaixner@gmail.com)  \nContributing Editor\n\nSee Comments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript) [ Comments powered by Disqus\n](http://disqus.com)\n\n![Lock](/images/icons/lock.png)\n\n### Restricted Content\n\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to enjoy a limited number of articles over\nthe next 30 days.\n\n[Please click here to continue without javascript..](?v=preview)\n\n# Top Stories\n\n  * [![Zippy duvall sonny perdue](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Secretaries-and-Administrators/Sonny-Perdue/thumb/Zippy_Duvall_Sonny_Perdue.jpg?1568682747)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13422-farm-bureau-makes-sweeping-appeal-to-usda-to-rescue-producers-nationwide)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Farm Bureau makes sweeping appeal to USDA to rescue producers\nnationwide](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13422-farm-bureau-makes-\nsweeping-appeal-to-usda-to-rescue-producers-nationwide)\n\n  * [![Dairy farm](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Animals/Dairy/thumb/dairy_farm.jpg?1585861729)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13418-farms-eager-for-forgivable-loans-amid-rules-uncertainty)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Farms eager for forgivable loans as SBA updates rules](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/13418-farms-eager-for-forgivable-loans-amid-rules-\nuncertainty)\n\n  * [![Black cattle walking](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Animals/Beef-cattle/thumb/black_cattle_walking.jpg?1585765218)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13410-lawmakers-call-for-targeted-temporary-relief-for-cattle-producers)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Lawmakers call for \u2018targeted, temporary\u2019 relief for cattle\nproducers](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13410-lawmakers-call-for-\ntargeted-temporary-relief-for-cattle-producers)\n\n  * [![Familyfarm 836](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Farmers-Market/thumb/familyfarm_836.jpg?1490804555)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13414-daybreak-april-2-farmers-allies-appeal-to-usda-for-covid-19-relief)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Daybreak April 2: Farmers, allies appeal to USDA for COVID-19\nrelief](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13414-daybreak-april-2-farmers-\nallies-appeal-to-usda-for-covid-19-relief)\n\n  * [![Jeff nunley](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/opinion/thumb/Jeff-Nunley.jpg?1567619510)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13411-opinion-farmers-are-essential-but-not-invincible)[Opinion: Farmers are essential, but not invincible](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13411-opinion-farmers-are-essential-but-not-invincible)\n\n[Visit Archive](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-open-mic-interview)[![Open mic\nlogo](/ext/resources/images/open-mic-logo.png)](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-\nopen-mic-interview)\n\n[![Tim lust open mic](//www.agri-\npulse.com/ext/resources/Podcasts2/Openmic/2020/thumb/Tim_Lust_Open_Mic.jpg?1586110802)](/media/podcasts/85-agri-\npulse-open-mic-interview/play/10898-nsp-ceo-tim-lust)\n\nApril 05, 2020\n\n# [NSP CEO Tim Lust](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-open-mic-\ninterview/play/10898-nsp-ceo-tim-lust)\n\nThis week\u2019s Open Mic guest is Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers.\nWhile the ag industry as a whole has suffered from many headwinds, Lust\nreports sorghum producers have fared better than others.

It enhanced the flavor of its lead product, the\nBeyond Burger, this spring and launched its first stock offering two months\nago at $25 per share. Its sales have been soaring and so has its stock value,\nnow around $150.\n\nBeyond is shipping its products to major grocery and restaurant chains\nthroughout the country and elsewhere: [Tim\nHortons](https://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/menu/beyond-meat-sausage.php)\nannounced in June it will offer Beyond products in its breakfast sandwiches at\n4,000 locations in Canada. Beyond will begin distributing its burgers in\nEurope next year under an operating agreement with Zandbergen, a Dutch meat\ncompany.\n\n[Impossible Foods](file:///C:/Users/emaixner/Documents/AGRI-\nPULSE/Mission%20Statement), also California based, [started\nmarketing](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/12063-burger-king-pilots-\nimpossible-whopper) its Impossible Burger at 59 Burger King outlets around St.\nLouis, Mo., just three months ago, and now it's scrambling to keep up with\norders as Burger King tries to supply all of its outlets with the burger by\nyear's end. Impossible isolated an iron-containing molecule in plants and\nanimals called [heme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6U4H8WC9jg) and added\nit to burgers to ensure a meat flavor.\n\n**[Farmers Restaurant Group](https://www.wearefoundingfarmers.com/locations/)\n(FRG), an early adopter, gives high marks** to the Impossible Burger, and uses\nthe same burger stock for its plant-based meatloaf option as well in its seven\nNorth Dakota Farmers Union-owned locations in the Washington, D.C., area and\nPennsylvania.\n\nDan Simons, co-owner and manager, says FRG operations started ordering\nImpossible Burger stock in late 2017 and now uses about 1,000 pounds a month\nfor patties and meatloaf. Customers pay about a $2 premium per serving for\nboth Impossible products, and Simons reports the products are ordered by the\nfull spectrum of consumers: vegans to those wanting to reduce meat consumption\nfor health reasons to devoted carnivores who are just curious.\n\n\"For any of these categories of folks, for whatever their motivation [to\nchoose Impossible],\" he says, \"the vast majority have a very favorable\nresponse.\"\n\n**Major meat companies are wading eagerly into alt-meat**.\n\nNestle, the world's biggest food company, began supplying its own Incredible\nBurger in April to McDonald's outlets in Germany and to other European\ncustomers. Not to be bested in the U.S. by the Impossible Burger, its Sweet\nEarth affiliate has already showcased its upcoming Awesome Burger at a\nCalifornia food show.\n\nBrazil-based JBS, the world's biggest meat company, announced it will begin\nselling its alt-burger in Brazil under its Seara products line. The patties\nwill be made with soy, wheat, garlic, onions and beetroot. Tyson Foods, a\npoultry, beef and pork processor, expects to market a new line of chicken-\nmimic nuggets and blended meat-plant burgers, meatballs, etc., under a new\n[Raised & Rooted](https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2019/6/tyson-\nfoods-unveils-alternative-protein-products-and-new-raised-rootedr) label and\nits existing Aidells brand. Perdue, meanwhile, announced in June a new\n[Chicken Plus](https://www.perduefarms.com/news/press-releases/perdue-foods-\nlaunches-chicken-plus-with-vegetable-nutrition-new-chicken-nuggets-tenders-\nand-patties-meet-demand-for-flexitarian-families/) line, using a blend of\nchicken and \"cauliflower, chickpeas, and plant protein to create the next\ngeneration of frozen chicken nuggets, tenders and patties,\" especially for\nflexitarian customers.\n\nSpam-maker [Hormel Foods](https://www.hormelfoods.com/), another leading\nprocessed meats firm, announced it'll soon market a vegan burger-like pizza\ntopping and other plant-based meat alternatives. Maple Leaf Foods of Canada\nannounced in April it's building a 230,000-square-foot plant in Shelbyville,\nInd., to give Beyond Meat a run with its own plant-based Lightlife Burger and\nother alt-meat items.\n\n![Will Sawyer](/ext/resources/Newsletter-photos/2019/7-3-19/Will-Sawyer.jpg)\n\nWill Sawyer, CoBank\n\n**The international giants \"are getting into the fray,\"** Sawyer says.\n\"They've got the bandwidth; they've got the R&D budgets and, most importantly,\nthey've got the relationships with the grocery stores and the food service\ncompanies to \u2026 make the supply chain work.\"\n\nAmid that rush to meat alternatives, Ball observes: \"When I count the press\nreleases I've seen in the first six months of the year, they've been very\ngeared to food services. So the growth in the industry \u2026 is going to be in the\nfast food restaurants\" and other food services generally, he predicts.\n\nBeyond Burgers are sold at Carl's Jr. Restaurants and TGI Fridays, for\nexample, and A&Ws in Canada. And KFC jumped into the plant-based meats game in\nthe UK in June with a non-meat chicken burger for its London customers.\n\nMcDonald's, though already serving Nestle's Incredible Burgers in Europe,\nhasn't put a plant-based patty on its U.S. menu. Sawyer says, however, that if\npopularity of those product keeps growing, \"I don't think any fast food chain\nis going to stay on the sidelines.\"\n\n**On the other hand, Sawyer offers two reality checks:**\n\n\"There does have to be a certain level of income for these kinds of products\nto make sense.\" China's top 1% of earners is 14 million people, for example,\nand rising incomes there suggest market potential. But much of the Earth's\npeople are still looking to introduce a little meat into their diets, not to\navoid meats.\n\nAlso, Sawyer says ground beef, pork, and poultry combined are \"a fraction of\nthe animal protein industry.\" And even though chicken alternatives are also\nnow hitting the market, \"when we talk about the alternatives world today, it's\npretty much ground beef, and it's staying in the ground world.\"\n\n**So to say alt-meat sales are soaring \"is an exaggeration,\" **Sawyer opines.\n\"It's not like they're selling alternative salmon \u2026 T-bones \u2026 chicken\nbreasts,\" he says.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of best nutrition per dollar, he says, the new meat/plant-\nblended products from Tyson, Perdue and others may fare well, especially\ncompeting with lean ground poultry choices, which the U.S. market \"has been\ngrowing by mid- to high-single digits for years now.\"\n\nBy now, readers may be wondering, so what's up with production of cultured\nmeat -- those masses of meat animal muscle to be grown in tanks?\n\nThere are huge investments by Bill Gates, Cargill, Tyson Foods and others in\ngrowing meat muscle _sans_ animal that way, and researchers in the U.S. and\nabroad are making progress. But, Ball summarizes: \"They're all still doing\nproduction at bench scale,\" and the developers face long regulatory approval\nprocesses before Americans will throw such meat on the grill.\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.agri-pulse.com/)\n\n![Edmaixnercapitol](//www.agri-\npulse.com/ext/resources/thumb/EdMaixnerCapitol.jpg?1482167569)\n\n[Ed Maixner](mailto:emaixner@gmail.com)  \nContributing Editor\n\nSee Comments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript) [ Comments powered by Disqus\n](http://disqus.com)\n\n![Lock](/images/icons/lock.png)\n\n### Restricted Content\n\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to enjoy a limited number of articles over\nthe next 30 days.\n\n[Please click here to continue without javascript..](?v=preview)\n\n# Top Stories\n\n  * [![Zippy duvall sonny perdue](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Secretaries-and-Administrators/Sonny-Perdue/thumb/Zippy_Duvall_Sonny_Perdue.jpg?1568682747)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13422-farm-bureau-makes-sweeping-appeal-to-usda-to-rescue-producers-nationwide)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Farm Bureau makes sweeping appeal to USDA to rescue producers\nnationwide](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13422-farm-bureau-makes-\nsweeping-appeal-to-usda-to-rescue-producers-nationwide)\n\n  * [![Dairy farm](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Animals/Dairy/thumb/dairy_farm.jpg?1585861729)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13418-farms-eager-for-forgivable-loans-amid-rules-uncertainty)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Farms eager for forgivable loans as SBA updates rules](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/13418-farms-eager-for-forgivable-loans-amid-rules-\nuncertainty)\n\n  * [![Black cattle walking](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Animals/Beef-cattle/thumb/black_cattle_walking.jpg?1585765218)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13410-lawmakers-call-for-targeted-temporary-relief-for-cattle-producers)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Lawmakers call for \u2018targeted, temporary\u2019 relief for cattle\nproducers](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13410-lawmakers-call-for-\ntargeted-temporary-relief-for-cattle-producers)\n\n  * [![Familyfarm 836](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Farmers-Market/thumb/familyfarm_836.jpg?1490804555)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13414-daybreak-april-2-farmers-allies-appeal-to-usda-for-covid-19-relief)\n\n[News](/topics/71-news)\n\n[Daybreak April 2: Farmers, allies appeal to USDA for COVID-19\nrelief](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13414-daybreak-april-2-farmers-\nallies-appeal-to-usda-for-covid-19-relief)\n\n  * [![Jeff nunley](https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/opinion/thumb/Jeff-Nunley.jpg?1567619510)](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13411-opinion-farmers-are-essential-but-not-invincible)[Opinion: Farmers are essential, but not invincible](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/13411-opinion-farmers-are-essential-but-not-invincible)\n\n[Visit Archive](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-open-mic-interview)[![Open mic\nlogo](/ext/resources/images/open-mic-logo.png)](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-\nopen-mic-interview)\n\n[![Tim lust open mic](//www.agri-\npulse.com/ext/resources/Podcasts2/Openmic/2020/thumb/Tim_Lust_Open_Mic.jpg?1586110802)](/media/podcasts/85-agri-\npulse-open-mic-interview/play/10898-nsp-ceo-tim-lust)\n\nApril 05, 2020\n\n# [NSP CEO Tim Lust](/media/podcasts/85-agri-pulse-open-mic-\ninterview/play/10898-nsp-ceo-tim-lust)\n\nThis week\u2019s Open Mic guest is Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers.\nWhile the ag industry as a whole has suffered from many headwinds, Lust\nreports sorghum producers have fared better than others.

hopes to sign up 500 customers a month and become an \"estate agent on\nbehalf of tenants.\"\n\n![Ex Bud, Monzo and Apple personnel plot to disrupt rental\nmarket](/images/featured/ex-bud-monzo-and-apple-execs-wanting-to-disrupt-\nrental-market.jpg)\n\nImage source: Image provided by Fronted  \n\n\"Really we see quite a lot of problems with the rental market,\" says [Jamie\nCampbell,](http://www.altfi.com/people/jamie-campbell) a former executive with\nthe HSBC-backed fintech [Bud ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/bud)who is now\nthe CEO of a new fintech hoping to disrupt the property rental market.\n\n\n\nFronted is the brainchild of Campbell, 30, former [Monzo\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/monzo)executive Simon Vans-Colina, 42, and\nAnthony Mann, 35, an engineer with Apple.\n\n\n\nThe three hip-looking thirty and fortysomethings all have experience of the\nrental market and believe it's in such a torrid state that it needs fixing.\n\nFronted's play is it believes it can sign-up cash-strapped renters by helping\nthem pay their deposits, offering cheaper lending rates by using Open Banking\nand other new-fangled technology as well as at a lower risk.\n\n\"We wanted to build something that was entirely focused on making the rental\nexperience better for renters,\" says Campbell.\n\nWhile there is excitement within the fintech space about the new venture,\nFronted is entering a competitive space, with competition from lenders and\npure-play tech companies.\n\n**A ballooning market**\n\nFronted is moving into a ballooning market: the rental market has soared to\nmore than \u00a350bn a year, more than double the level ten years ago, according to\nfigures by Countrywide.\n\nRaising a deposit for a new property can be a bane for renters, particularly\nthe younger generation, preventing thousands from moving, as often they have\nto pay a new deposit before getting the previous deposit back.\n\n\"There are all sorts of issues along the journey of renting. For us, this\ndeposit loan is really the first way into this market,\" Campbell tells\n_AltFi._\n\n\"It addresses a big consumer need around making the initial outlay when you\nmove into an apartment less burdensome. It does it in a way where it doesn't\nbecome  preventable expensive.\"\n\n**Ambition to disrupt**\n\nCampbell says Fronted's long-term ambition is to be \"an estate agent on behalf\nof tenants.\"\n\nTo achieve this status, Fronted is hoping to launch a suite of products,\nincluding a service for paying utility bills, so renters can \"turn up, turn on\ntheir services\" when they move into their properties.\n\nIts first product, paying rental deposits upfront, is set to launch in March\nthis year with a limited number of tenants.\n\nIt will use Open Banking technology to assess a tenant's financial wellbeing\nbefore lending them their tenancy deposit.\n\nOnce it has agreed to provide credit, Fronted will send the deposit to the\nestate agent, which will put it in a tenancy deposit scheme (TDP). Renters\nwill pay the money back in instalments over the duration of the rental.\n\nFronted will make money on the interest, with typical yields on these\nunsecured loans around 12.5 per cent.\n\nFronted believes its loans will be a cheaper option for renters than taking\nout an overdraft or paying by a credit card.\n\n**[FCA](http://www.altfi.com/companies/financial-conduct-authority)Sandbox\nProgramme**\n\nBeing a consumer credit proposition, Fronted will need to adhere to [FCA\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/financial-conduct-authority)rules.\n\nFronted has applied to get on the [FCA\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/financial-conduct-authority)Sandbox\nProgramme, a scheme that allows businesses with inventive technology to run\ntrials with consumers that are tightly supervised by the regulator.\n\nFor instance, Fronted can test use of Open Banking to underwrite and get\ncustomers signed up, as well as testing different payment models.\n\nIt will find out later in February whether it is on the programme.\n\n\"We are confident as we can be,\" says Campbell, about getting on the scheme.\n\n\"We are building the company on the assumption that we will be in. We have no\nreason to believe that we won't get in.\"\n\n**Competition**\n\nFronted will have to jockey for market share against insurtech companies like\nCanopy and Dlighted who operate in this space, as well as taking on generic\nlenders.\n\nBut Campbell is adamant Fronted is in a strong position, arguing that generic\nlenders are put off by the relatively small size of the deposits involved and\n\"kind of faffy\" nature of the paperwork while some insurtech propositions do\nnot favour renters.\n\n\"What that insurance is there for is not for the tenant to claim on if\nanything goes wrong,\" he says.\n\n\"But for a landlord to claim on if a tenant misses rent. And so that product\nis pro-landlord and arguably it is quite a poor experience for a customer.\"\n\nCampbell also points out that Fronted will act as a counterpoint to a growing\nconcern from campaigners that some companies are pushing deposit-free options\nwithout making it clear they could cost renters more over time.\n\n**500 sign-ups a month and getting the message out**\n\n\"Where we want to be by the end of the year is we want to have proved our\nmodel with the [FCA ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/financial-conduct-\nauthority)Sandbox.

After\nthe \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d a year of price drops and doldrums, crypto spring sent\nBTC rising back up; crypto summer has sustained the price over $10,000.\n\nNow that we\u2019re entering into autumn, a rather unique set of circumstances has\nthe market poised to move in either direction. Perhaps most notably is the\nfact that for the last several weeks, BTC dominance-the ratio of capital in\nBitcoin markets to the amount of capital in altcoin markets-has been hovering\naround 70 percent, the highest that it has been since July of 2017.\n\n[ **London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join\nNow**](https://events.financemagnates.com/londonsummit2019/?utm_source=Autolink&utm_medium=Articles&utm_campaign=FM)\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/btcdominance.png)\n\nMarc Bhargava, Co-founder and President of[ digital asset trading platform\nTagomi](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/tagomi-claims-to-\nmake-shorting-on-crypto-much-easier-report/), told Finance Magnates that that\nfigure could be even higher.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/marc-\nbhargava-150x150.jpg)Marc Bhargava\n\n\"[The] key insight here is that dominance is actually higher than reported\nsince more of the alt market caps are not liquid. BTC dominance could be\ncloser to 80%,\u201d he said. \u201cOn CoinMarket Cap, it says bitcoin dominance is 68%,\nbut includes a lot of questionable exchange volume plus many tokens outside\nthe top 15 which really aren't tradeable in meaningful size. Therefore, the\nmarket caps are not correct.\u201d\n\nThe rise began to pick up speed in late April, several weeks after the first\nin a series of strong upward price movements in BTC. On April 1st, the price\nof BTC was roughly $4,132; by the end of the month, it had surpassed $5,200.\nAt press time, BTC was trading for $10,270, up a fraction of a percent over\nthe last 24 hours.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Bitcoin dominance up? And where do we go from here?\n\n## Bakkt launch could be driving both BTC price and BTC dominance\n\nSeveral events over the course of the last two months have been speculated as\nbeing the driving force behind the latest upward movements in BTC dominance.\n\nThe most \u201cpopular\u201d theories seem to be connected to two announcements of\ninstitutional products: first, the announcement that the Intercontinental\nExchange-backed cryptocurrency futures trading platform, Bakkt, will finally\nlaunch after a year of delays; second, the launch of [VanEck/SolidX' so-called\n\"limited ETF\"](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/what-does-\nthe-flop-of-van-ecks-btf-say-about-bitcoin-etfs/), and the upcoming October\nSEC decision on the full ETF.\n\nA number of analysts have predicted that the launch of Bakkt will bring a wave\nof institutional capital into cryptocurrency markets (particularly Bitcoin\u2019s);\nas such, it\u2019s possible that a number of holders have been stocking up on BTC\nin anticipation of a possible price run.\n\nAlternatively, institutional traders may even already be depositing BTC into\nBakkt trading accounts in preparation for the launch.\n\nIn fact, a[ massive\ntransaction](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/1-billion-\nbtc-transaction-plustoken-payout-or-bakkt-deposit/) earlier this month\ninvolving the sending of 94,505 BTC (worth roughly $1 billion) to a Bitcoin\nwallet earlier this month was widely speculated to be a such a deposit.\n\n## Could ETF drama be a factor?\n\nThe launch of the so-called \u201climited ETF\u201d by Van Eck and SolidX did not bring\nin nearly as much capital or interest from investors as was originally\nanticipated. As of September 12th, roughly $41,000-the equivalent of just\naround 4 BTC-had been invested in the product.\n\nStill, the launch of the limited ETF has brought more media attention onto the\nfact that the SEC must make a final decision on Van Eck/SolidX\u2019 application\nfor a Bitcoin ETF this coming October, after[ months and months of\ndelays.](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/solidx-teams-\nvaneck-launch-physically-backed-bitcoin-etf/)\n\nHowever, in a LinkedIn [post,](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-\ncreadon_the-bitcoin-dominance-index-is-701-this-\nactivity-6574637775340085248-qXCN) Michael Creadon, Head of Institutional\nSales at DrawBridge Lending, warned about the possible negative consequences\nof this limited ETF: \u201cI get nervous when I see stories about backdoor,\n\u2018technical\u2019 SEC rulings,\u201d he said, referencing the fact that the limited ETF\nwas [created on the basis of SEC exemption\n144A.](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/vaneck-bitcoin-\netf-uses-rule-144a-to-get-around-sec-rejection/)\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/michael-\ncreadon-150x150.jpg)Michael Creadon, Head of Business Development at\nDrawBridge Lending.\n\n\u201cAll the SEC rules are technical. Do you mean to tell me we've been awaiting\nBTC ETFs for 5 years & only now some attorney cracked the code & read the\nentire rule book? I'll give an example: our firm can't face retail investors\nbecause we use swaps. That's the rule-period.\u201d\n\nCreadon also pointed out that the media cycle-and the price movements that\nhave followed-surrounding the Van Eck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF has all become a bit\ntoo speculative: \u201ccoming from Chicago where futures and options rule supreme I\nthink the BTC ETF melodrama is a bit overblown,\u201d he wrote. \u201cbut hey, all new\nderivatives are a positive and I respect the heck out of the Van Eck team's\nperseverance. And I hope that this approval\u2019 is fully in lockstep with the\nregulators in Washington so we don't have to take another mulligan.\u201d\n\n## When compared with BTC, altcoins are way down\n\nWhatever the cause, crypto market analyst Willy Woo pointed out that the\neffect of the rise in Bitcoin dominance has been-well, not great.\n\nThis becomes particularly clear if altcoin prices are measured in BTC rather\nthan USD. Woo showed this in a rather aesthetically pleasing chart on Twitter:\n\n> \"Shit runs downhill\", 2019 bull season edition.\n>\n> This is the performance of the the top 200 coins measured in satoshi value\n> (performance against BTC).\n>\n> Note alts got particularly rekted after BTC broke out on 1st Apr.\n> [pic.twitter.com/lN3Jdnsfni](https://t.co/lN3Jdnsfni)\n>\n> \u2014 Willy Woo (@woonomic) [August 13,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1161320822344179720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nArk Invest crypto analyst Yassine Elmandjra made a similar point in a separate\nseries of tweets.\n\n> 2/ In BTC terms:\n>\n> - ETH is down 77%  \n>  - XRP is down 67%  \n>  - BCH is down 50%  \n>  - LTC is down 90%  \n>  - BNB is down 25%  \n>  - EOS is down 60%  \n>  - BSV is down 26%  \n>  - XMR is down 60%\n>\n> from when their current USD price levels were at highs in BTC terms.\n>\n> \u2014 Yassine Elmandjra (@yassineARK) [August 12,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/yassineARK/status/1161029463410380800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Are we in store for an \u201calt-season\u201d?\n\nBut perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could eventually benefit altcoins in a\nmeaningful way-after all, the \u201calt-season\u201d phenomena that showed a repeated\npattern of increased capital in altcoin markets following boosts in Bitcoin\ncould point to an eventual recovery.\n\nAs such, some analysts have claimed that Bitcoin dominance will soon take a\nheavy hit. According to \u201cBitcoin Jack,\u201d former lead analyst at Bitcoin\nBravado, now is a crucial time to hodl onto one\u2019s altcoins, and that BTC\ndominance will soon \u201cfall off a cliff.\u201d\n\n## Suggested articles\n\nFBS Launches Online Trading School - FBS Trading Bootcamp[Go to article\n>>](https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/fbs-launches-online-\ntrading-school-fbs-trading-bootcamp/)\n\n> If you're selling your alts here, you are doing this wrong\n>\n> You don't get charts more beautiful than this one\n>\n> FFFFFFF\u2026\u2026\n>\n> \u2026\u2026RACTAL\n>\n> If we get a nice consolidation after hitting the top box, continuation as\n> squigly is likely\n>\n> If not, still a monster rally\n> [pic.twitter.com/5hTjRrOuAI](https://t.co/5hTjRrOuAI)\n>\n> \u2014 Bitcoin \ud835\udd75ack (@BTC_JackSparrow) [September 6,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/BTC_JackSparrow/status/1170097405552975872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSimilarly, self-described \u201cCryptoGem finder\u201d Faisal Sohail proclaimed that the\nnext alt-season is right around the corner.\n\n> I'm not the kind of person who follows the herd, so contrary to what the\n> masses believe, I hereby declare that\n> [#altseason](https://twitter.com/hashtag/altseason?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> is very close. \ud83d\udcaf\n>\n> Your patience will truly be tested in the next seven days before Bakkt\n> launches.\n>\n> Stay strong fam! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n>\n> \u2014 Faisal Sohail \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f\ud83e\udd18 (@oddgems) [September 14,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/oddgems/status/1172975040100306944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Where is this all headed?\n\nSo, if altcoin markets continue to stay strong-or even grow in strength-how\nwill BTC\u2019s dominance and price be affected long term?\n\nMati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, noted in a tweet that\n\u201cBitcoin dominance is now comparable to where it was before there was even a\ndeveloped market for altcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to see it getting much stronger than here,\u201d he added, suggesting that\nthis is the limit for BTC given the number of altcoins currently on the\nmarket.\n\n> Bitcoin dominance is now comparable to where it was before there was even a\n> developed market for altcoins.\n>\n> Hard to see it getting much stronger from here.\n> [pic.twitter.com/pgfNWLQipr](https://t.co/pgfNWLQipr)\n>\n> \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) [September 16,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/MatiGreenspan/status/1173602488659927040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin dominance hasn\u2019t been this high for more than two years, and\nthe number of altcoins has grown significantly during the same period.\nHowever, altcoins have been a significant force in BTC markets for far longer\nthan that.\n\n\u201cThere was a thriving market for them, on an understandably less grandiose\nscale, during the bull market of 2013,\u201d wrote crypto journalist Richard\nDelaney in a piece for NewsBTC earlier this week. \u201cThe names might have been\nlargely different and the sums of money smaller, but for those in the industry\nat that time, the hype was comparable.\u201d\n\n## Willy Woo drops the mic: market corrections are yet to come\n\nHowever, Willy Woo pointed out in a series of tweets that altcoin markets\nstill haven\u2019t completely \u201cdetoxed\u201d from the hype cycles that took place at the\nend of 2017.\n\n> If this level fails, I'd expect roughly a 60% drop relative to Bitcoin's cap\n> before we some the next area of support.\n> [pic.twitter.com/FpOIIjVeqD](https://t.co/FpOIIjVeqD)\n>\n> \u2014 Willy Woo (@woonomic) [September 8,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1170745333099499520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\u201cFundamentally, though alts are screaming in pain, these two charts show how\nthey have not yet detoxed from 2017 bubble valuations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThough\nlocally oversold and may see some bounce in coming weeks, longer term, into\n2020, I can't see these levels holding (relative to Bitcoin).\u201d\n\n> Here's the same data visualised on the price domain.  \n>  Total crypto cap priced in BTC supply.\n>\n> The 2017 gap that opened up was made of ponzi fluff, ERC20 ICOs investing in\n> other ERC20 ICOs blowing up their combined caps like a fiat money printing\n> machine.

It will be the chain\u2019s third hotel\nin the capital, following the Alt Hotel on Slater Street and the Le Germain\nHotel on Daly Avenue.\n\nFor Group Germain director of development Hugo Germain, the chance to add to\nthe rapidly growing Quebec-based company\u2019s stable of airport properties was\ntoo good to pass up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty rare, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so excited about\nthis one,\u201d he says of airport proposals. \u201cWhen those opportunities come by,\nthey don\u2019t come twice.\u201d\n\nIn this case, that\u2019s not quite accurate. The Ottawa airport authority\ninitially started looking for potential partners to construct a new airport\nhotel back in 2015.\n\nThree sites were considered, and plenty of developers were keen on the\nproposal, Tkach says. But bidders clearly favoured a site that would allow\nthem to link a hotel directly to the airport terminal, and the option best\nsuited for that, located just south of the terminal, posed a number of\nconstruction challenges, he concedes.\n\nThe airport authority went back to the drawing board and did another land\nstudy to find a more suitable space for a hotel, eventually rebooting the RFP\nprocess in 2017.\n\nThe new location next to the parking garage \u201cwas a lot less speculative and it\nwas a lot more exact in terms of what the land could bear,\u201d Tkach says.\n\nGroup Germain\u2019s previous experience in building airport hotels \u200b\u2013 it already\noperates Alt-branded properties at Toronto\u2019s Pearson International Airport and\nHalifax Stanfield International Airport \u200b\u2013 gave the Canadian chain a clear\nedge, he says.\n\nA number of complications can arise when building a hotel so close to an\nairport, Tkach says, including the need to make sure the structure doesn\u2019t\ninterfere with a pilot\u2019s sight lines.\n\n[ Subscribe to our Newsletters  ](/newsletter/signup)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have an operator that knows most of those,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe new property will feature a restaurant and meeting rooms on the top floor\noffering 360-degree views of the terminal and runways. Guests will also be\nallowed to check out whenever they wish, meaning they can relax in their rooms\nuntil just before they need to head over to catch their flights. There will\nalso be informal meeting space on the ground floor just steps away from the\nterminal, Germain adds.\n\n\u201cWe become an extension of the airport,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom the

BodeTree CEO Chris Myers, commented:\n\n _\" The integration of BodeTree's financial tools and Credibly's efficient and\nequitable lending process equips even more small businesses with the resources\nand capital they need to thrive. The spirit of our partnership, and the shared\nvision of both companies, is truly about helping small businesses.\"_\n\nFounded in 2010 and rebranded as [Credibly\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/credibly)last June, the platform targets the\nentire SMB credit spectrum, offering businesses a wide range of tailored\ncapital solutions. Since inception, the platform has funded more than 4,500\nbusinesses in over 300 industries, providing them with more than $200 million\nto date. Last year, the company registered a revenue growth of 100% and has\ndoubled its employees to 120, opening new offices around the US.\n\nThe agreement with BodeTree will allow [Credibly\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/credibly)to enhance its product suite and to\nprovide small businesses with solutions that better reflect their needs.\n[Glenn Goldman,](http://www.altfi.com/people/glenn-goldman) CEO of\n[Credibly,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/credibly) weighed in:\n\n _\" At [Credibly,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/credibly) we believe all\nbusinesses deserve the right to access capital, and our partnership with\nBodeTree makes good on the mission of providing that access to as many\nentrepreneurs as possible. The insights garnered from the BodeTree platform,\ncoupled with access to funding through\n[Credibly,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/credibly) will help BodeTree's\ncustomers achieve their growth goals.\"_\n\nLast June, AltFi\n[interviewed](http://www.altfi.com/article/1125_retailcapital_rebrands_credibly_is_born)\nGlenn about the rebrand and about his view on the alternative finance\nindustry. On that occasion, Glenn voiced his concern about the lack of\nplatforms with a product set sufficient to tackle the super prime and sub\nprime ends of the credit spectrum, and everything in between.

Things are changing so fast\nthat we barely have time to steady ourselves after one technological wave,\nbefore another washes up on deck and sweeps us off our feet again.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why this is happening when we look at technological\ndevelopment in historical terms. Older technologies, like the telephone and\nthe car, [were adopted by consumers gradually, over\ntime](https://marketrealist.imgix.net/uploads/2015/12/Technology-\nAdoption.png?w=620&amp;h=600&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format), sometimes over\ndecades. Newer technologies, like the cell phone and social media, spread\nseemingly overnight, taking almost no time to go from invention to universal\nuse.\n\nToday, each new technology scales with bewildering speed. It is no longer an\nadoption curve; it\u2019s an adoption rocket. With AI, genetic engineering and\nrobotics on the anvil, this pace is unlikely to let up anytime soon. It\u2019s\ndisrupting political, economic and social systems as well as cultural norms\nand social roles.\n\nIt is also taking a toll on each of us psychologically and emotionally.\n\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/0Z6oAOIiRJZ6evTeFkgIc2Qa5Bfr2Pz7PBTf1ihHYdo.jpg)\n\nDisruption: in business, education, and everyday life\n\nExamples of this disruption abound. The impact of social media [on the Brexit\nelection](https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy?language=en#t-235194)\nand across the world has yet to be completely understood and poses the\nquestion: Are free and fair elections still possible? Even the creators of\nthese digital technologies have limited understanding of them and in some\ncases lose control when AI algorithms take over, as with the awkward situation\nthat arose when the recent Notre-Dame fire was [algorithmically and\ninappropriately classified](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/youtube-\nmistakenly-flags-notre-dame-fire-videos-911/story?id=62419884) with a very\ndifferent kind of conflagration, the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs an educator, I\u2019ve seen schools stockpile technology and then struggle to\nbring it to life in a meaningful way to improve learning. The money spent\nhasn\u2019t translated into large-scale value creation. It reminds us of author\nPeter Drucker\u2019s words: \u201cDo not confuse motion with progress.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent car ride (Lyft) in Manhattan, I learnt from the driver that\none of his friends is filing personal bankruptcy because he acquired two New\nYork City cab medallions for $800K about a decade ago, and now with ride-share\nservices gaining popularity the medallions are worth a fraction of the price\nhe paid. Disruption can happen fast and hit us in the face. With self-driving\ncars just round the corner, even the Uber/Lyft drivers will soon be facing\ndisruption.\n\nThe above three examples from different settings highlight the forces of\ndisruption and the need for us to recast our political, educational, and\neconomic systems. Creating change on one dimension is a daunting task. Imagine\ndoing that on multiple dimensions.\n\nIf we don\u2019t change ourselves, it will be impossible to change the systems and\ninstitutions that govern and enable us. Rapid learning and rapid execution are\nkeys to staying ahead.\n\n##  Three key skills\n\nThere are three key attributes that I\u2019m convinced we must cultivate in order\nto take on the challenges the fast-paced disruptive world throws at us:\nlearning agility, resilience, and grounded optimism.\n\n**1\\. Learning agility** : This is the ability and willingness to learn and\nthen apply that learning effectively to prevail even in unfamiliar situations.\nThe seeds of lifelong learning come from curiosity. Curiosity is the innate\nurge to know, the spark that drives us to explore, discover, invent and\nreinvent. Today, as we get older, most of us don\u2019t make a point of nurturing\nour curiosity. But we will have to do it and get better at it. If we don\u2019t\nlearn, how will we evolve? If we end up with a fixed mindset, it will be\nharder to adapt, evolve and excel.\n\nAs [Alvin\nToffler](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-\ned4-00010964) predicted: \u201cThe illiterate of the 21st century will not be those\nwho cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\u201d\n\nHow can one develop learning agility?\n\n\u2022 Be curious \u2013 start by asking \u201cwhy?\u201d Do it continually.\n\n\u2022 Explore. Try new things and engage with different types of people.\n\n\u2022 Reflect. Cultivate self-awareness. Make yourself do this. Actively seek\nfeedback and help. See failure as learning.\n\nA Harvard Business Review article on \u201c[Improve your ability to\nlearn](https://hbr.org/2015/06/improve-your-ability-to-learn)\u201d calls out\nInnovating, Performing, Reflecting and Risking as key learning ability\nenablers.\n\n**2\\. Resilience** : This is the quality that enables one to bounce back when\nknocked down by life. It helps us to endure and thrive. In a disruptive world,\ncoping with stress and catastrophe are vital, as adversity and new challenges\nbecome mainstays of life.\n\nResilience is important in personal life and business. Take a quick\n[test](https://hbr.org/2015/01/assessment-how-resilient-are-you) to see where\nyou stand on three key attributes of resilience: challenge, control and\ncommitment.\n\nHow can you build resilience?\n\n\u2022 Practice cognitive reframing. Learn to make the mental shifts necessary to\nidentify the upsides and not just the downsides of a difficult situation.\n\n\u2022 Avoid the victimization mindset (\u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d) It\u2019s not\nhelpful.\n\n\u2022 Meditate.\n\n**3\\. Grounded optimism** : Optimism is the propensity to anticipate the best\npossible outcome. Grounded optimism is where that optimism has a healthy dose\nof realism and pessimism blended in with it. Grounded optimists are wired to\ntake the positive emotion and convert that into tangible action leading to\nrealistic solutions.\n\nOptimism can be learned. [Martin\nSeligman](https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/faculty-\nprofile/profile-dr-martin-seligman), who is considered the father of positive\npsychology, introduced the concept of [learned\noptimism](http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-\nMind/dp/1400078393/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1490118433&sr=1-1&keywords=learned+optimism+by+martin+seligman)\nbased on his research on learned helplessness. Stanford has a\n[survey](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande271/onlinetools/LearnedOpt.html)\nbased on Martin's research to analyse one's mindset \u2013 the pessimist-optimist\nspectrum.\n\nHow to build grounded optimism?\n\n\u2022 Focus on the positive.\n\n\u2022 Read about optimists and keep company with people who have both an\noptimistic and realistic outlook.\n\n\u2022 Be mindful. Mindfulness is a skill, and there\u2019s a lot to it. Fortunately,\nthere are plenty of resources to help you cultivate it.\n\nAs we dive deeper into the 21st century (shorter product life cycles, breaking\nbusiness models, competing against machines), IQ alone will not be sufficient\nto help us adapt. A healthy dose of EQ (emotional intelligence) and RQ\n(resilience quotient) are critical as we chart our courses.\n\nToday, we live in a\n\u201c[VUCA](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/05/09/how-vuca-is-\nreshaping-the-business-environment-and-what-it-means-for-\ninnovation/#47a130adeb8d)\u201d world, characterized by volatility, uncertainty,\ncomplexity and ambiguity. In this world, it isn't how hard you fall or how\nmany times you fall, but how fast you get up that matters. Are you ready to\nunleash the VUCA warrior in

[Beyond Meat](https://www.barrons.com/quote/BYND) tested\nplant-based fried chicken at a KFC in Atlanta, and the stuff sold out in five\nhours. It was another win for the start-up, which at last count had products\nin over 53,000 outlets. The chicken foray also demonstrates that the\nalternative-meat industry\u2019s initial beef-mimicking products are just the start\nfor plant-based protein.\n\n\u201cWe are truly on the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Danny O\u2019Malley, the\n\u201cpresiplant\u201d of Before the Butcher, another alternative-meat start-up. The\ncompany makes alternative chicken and pork, as well as alternative beef.\nO\u2019Malley left food distributor [Sysco](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SYY) for\nBeyond Meat, then founded Before the Butcher. His company has products in more\nthan 2,000 retail outlets.\n\n\u201cThere is no technical difficulty related to chicken specifically,\u201d says a\nspokeswoman for Impossible Foods, another alt-meat producer. \u201cThe heme content\nwill be lower in chicken, as it will with other white meats.\u201d Impossible makes\nsynthetic heme, which helps the company mimic the flavor profile of animal-\nbased protein.\n\nDespite Beyond Meat\u2019s product expansion, _Barron\u2019s_ continues to worry about\nnew competition, its lofty valuation, and stock volatility. Still, the\nexcitement across the industry is palpable. Two weeks back, JPMorgan\u2019s Ken\nGoldman made the firm\u2019s list of its most-read research with a Beyond Meat\nupgrade. After KFC, the stock is up 13% this past week. So far, investors\u2019\nappetite for Beyond Meat shares equal diners\u2019 desire to try alternative meat.\n\n###### Last Week\n\n###### Weathering the Storm\n\nStocks are being buffeted by trade winds. They dove after President Donald\nTrump threatened to force companies out of China and to raise tariffs on\nChinese goods, then climbed as he walked much of that back. The result:\nuncertainty, with the yield curve inversion deepening at midweek. Despite\nthat, the Dow industrials on the week surged 3%, to 26,403.28; the S&P 500\nrose 2.8%, to 2926.46; and the Nasdaq Composite popped 2.7%, to 7962.88.\n\n###### Mixed Messaging\n\nTrump suggested that he was rethinking tariffs, only to be corrected by his\nown administration. He then said China was calling to seek a restart to trade\ntalks, only to have Chinese officials say no call had been made; it\u2019s still\nunclear who\u2019s talking to whom. Trump did announce a trade deal with Japan,\npromising Japanese corn purchases in exchange for going easy on Japanese car\nimports to the U.S. The deal has yet to be finalized.\n\n###### Carney\u2019s Virtual Currency\n\nAlthough Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell got the headlines at Jackson\nHole, Wyo., the head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, may have stirred the\nmost provocative discussion. With trade conflicts in mind, Carney proposed a\ndigital virtual currency that would replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve\ncurrency. While even Carney admitted that his plan was unrealistic in the near\nterm, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard put it into perspective: \u201cThe best\n[policy] would be: get rid of the political uncertainty. Then you wouldn\u2019t\nhave this issue.\u201d\n\n###### Paying for Opioids\n\nAn Oklahoma judge found [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.barrons.com/quote/JNJ)\nresponsible for abetting the opioid crisis in that state, and hit the\ndrugmaker with a $572 million penalty. J&J stock then rose, probably because\ninvestors were happy that it was a lot less than what the state had sought:\n$17.5 billion. The case will be appealed. Separately, the Sackler family,\nowners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, are in talks to pay $3 billion to\nresolve lawsuits, part of a $10 billion to $12 billion settlement. The family\nwould give up ownership in Purdue, which would file for Chapter 11.\n\n###### Boris Shuts Parliament\n\nQueen Elizabeth II granted United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s\nrequest to suspend Parliament until Oct. 14 after Parliament returns from its\nAugust recess. Johnson insisted he needed more time to gather his \u201cexciting\nnew agenda,\u201d but members of Parliament argued that he was trying to force\nthrough his approach to Brexit by the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\n###### A Hard Rain\n\nDorian, a potential Category 4 hurricane, brushed Puerto Rico and appeared\nheaded to the Florida coast on Labor Day. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal\nreported the administration is considering a plan to roll back rules on\nmethane emissions, despite opposition from major energy companies.\n\n**Email:** [editors@barrons.com](mailto:editors@barrons.com)\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### Beyond Meat\u2019s Test at KFC Shows There\u2019s a Market for Alternative Chicken\n\nHoly alternative cow!

Now, the suite's\nlatest iteration is also a testament to BASS' solid two-pronged approach that\nintegrates BASSnet\u2122 modules for holistic coverage, while embodying the suite\nwith powerful data-driven analytics and predictions. With BASSnet\u2122, vessel\ndata is no longer a 'white elephant' sitting on the sidelines of the fleet\nmanagement process.\n\n![](/media/images/article/Photos/Miscellaneous/bassnet-2a.jpg)  \n**Integrated Suite of Modules**\n\nAs a unified system, BASSnet\u2122 has strategically diverged from the traditional\nparadigm often seen in maritime software: multiple piecemeal systems that can\nlead to cross-compatibility issues, high costs and tricky implementation.\n\nInstead, the 'single platform' strategy behind BASSnet\u2122 makes the fragmented\nnature of traditional systems a thing of the past. BASSnet\u2122 is consistent in\ndesign, platform and user experience, with functionality and content that\nstreamlines business processes across disparate sections of vessel and office\nmanagement.\n\nFor example, the BASSnet\u2122 Projects (Dry-docking) module is tightly integrated\nwith powerful Procurement, Maintenance and Financials modules to capture all\naspects of the docking process flow, including the supplier-quotation chain\nand machinery status. In addition, BASSnet's HSEQ module is integrated with\nCrewing and Maintenance features; this prioritises safety at all levels.\nBASSnet\u2122 is also a powerful tool to aid in meeting compliance requirements in\na complex regulatory environment, providing extensive functionality, reporting\nand data privacy tools.\n\nAs a complete enterprise solution for maintenance, operational, safety and\nfinancial management, BASSnet\u2122 gives ship managers and owners the freedom and\nconfidence to focus their attention and resources on delivering results for\ntheir main business, instead of getting bogged down in diverse, incompatible\nsystems from multiple providers. This was a fundamental reason for the recent\ndeal inked between BASS and the Wallem Group, a key endorsement of BASSnet's\nsuperior functionality as an integrated suite of modules.\n\n![](/media/images/article/Photos/Miscellaneous/bassnet-3.jpg)  \n**Data-Driven Value**\n\nThe use of a single database is a foundation of the centralised experience\nthat BASSnet\u2122 offers. A single database ensures data consistency and\nintegrity. Also, new vessels can be up and running with the application\ninstalled swiftly and easily. The likelihood of data duplication is avoided,\nwhile data accuracy is substantially increased. This makes it easy to build\nhigh-quality PMS databases, for instance.\n\nIn addition, ship owners can be assured of accurate and seamless data\ncollection to drive powerful analytics and predictions, with predictive\nmaintenance being integral to prevent unscheduled downtime.\n\nData-driven analytics are a vital facet of BASS' success. In this age of 'big\ndata', it is essential for ship owners to capitalise on the wealth of\ninformation available across a fleet of vessels to provide valuable insight\ninto the workings of the corporate engine. This drives clear management\nstrategies on a fleet-wide basis. However, randomised sets of information are\nof no use to decision-makers on the go.\n\nBASSnet\u2122 is a solution that not only enables comprehensive data capture but\nalso integrates, consolidates and translates that data into actionable\nintelligence via in-depth trend and pattern analysis. This mature data\nstrategy fully utilizes the significant cache of collected information to\ncreate value.\n\nFor example, comprehensive overview tools provide a 'helicopter' view of fleet\nperformance, compliance, machinery status and urgent issues that may arise.\nThis facilitates optimization of the fleet inventory and maintenance plan at\nall times. Ship owners can also access informative data and KPI charts to spot\nweak points or limitations in their business processes, making it easier to\ncraft effective maintenance plans for cohesive operations.\n\nWith BASSnet's use of data and analytics, ship owners can be assured of\nincreased operational efficiency, productivity and revenue growth, a valuable\ntrifecta reinforced by suite-driven cost savings and optimal employment of\nresources.\n\n![](/media/images/article/Photos/Miscellaneous/bassnet-4.jpg)  \n**Global Connectivity through Mobile & Web Applications**\n\nIn a globalised environment, connectivity on-the-go is a 'must-have' for\nexecutives worldwide. BASS has taken note of the exciting opportunities\nprovided by worldwide connectivity, and is already in the process of\ntransitioning all modules to web applications. Part of this move comes in the\nform of convenient mobile apps. These tools give immediate access to fleet\ninformation, helping decision makers, administrators and crew to make\ninformed, time-sensitive decisions anywhere and anytime while easing real-time\ncommunication between vessels and the office.\n\nThe BASSnet\u2122 Web Portal, for example, provides online access to useful key\nperformance indicators and compliance information to guide sound decision-\nmaking from ship or shore. Users can also instantly review and approve time-\nsensitive items without delay. As for mobile solutions, the BASSnet\u2122 Inventory\napp is invaluable for real-time material management during stock-takes while\nwalking onboard a vessel. The upcoming BASSnet\u2122 Crew Portal app similarly\nprovides instant access to crew members' personal information, schedule,\ntraining, compliance and travel arrangements.\n\n![](/media/images/article/Photos/Miscellaneous/bassnet-5.jpg)  \n**Conveniently Available in the Cloud**\n\nAlongside the transition to web applications, BASSnet\u2122 is proud to be at the\nforefront of another frontier in digitalisation - cloud services. Under the\nbanner of BASSnet\u2122 SaaS (Software as a Service), customers can easily access\nBASSnet\u2122 in the cloud without the burden of upfront infrastructure, platform\nand software costs. Management and maintenance of software and hardware are\nhandled fully by BASS, with comprehensive support services ensuring\nuninterrupted and smooth system usage. Essential preventive and pro-active\nmonitoring and management services by BASS experts are also primed to drive\nsignificant cost-savings for ship owners over the long term.\n\n![](/media/images/article/Photos/Miscellaneous/bassnet-6.jpg)  \n**Vision for the Future**\n\n2019 has seen the culmination of several successful initiatives spearheaded by\nBASS' forward-thinking and future-proof strategy, with BASSnet\u2122 Fleet\nManagement Systems becoming a much sought-after solution in the maritime\nmarketplace. The big question now is: what's next?\n\nWith the rapid pace of digitalisation overtaking traditional ecosystems, BASS\nis excited to explore a number of new and developing technologies. Multi-\nplatform products, machine learning, artificial intelligence and IOT-enabled\ndevices are spheres of interest planned to lead future offerings. With an eye\non the future, and as an industry-proven solution from a reputable and\nestablished provider, BASSnet\u2122 is in a prime position to fuel what is becoming\nan exceptional growth story and create even greater value for ship owners,\nmanagers and crew.\n\nThe opinions expressed herein are the author's and not necessarily those of\nThe Maritime Executive.\n\n**MORE** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ ABS Leads EU-Funded Study on the Future of the EEDI ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/abs-leads-eu-funded-study-on-the-future-of-the-eedi)\n\n  * #####  [ North Sea, U.S. Gulf Producers Work to Keep COVID-19 Off Platforms ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/north-sea-u-s-gulf-producers-work-to-keep-covid-19-off-platforms)\n\n  * #####  [ USNS Comfort to Accept COVID-19 Patients ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/usns-comfort-to-accept-covid-19-patients)\n\n  * #####  [ RightShip and Human Rights at Sea Join Forces ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/rightship-and-human-rights-at-sea-join-forces)\n\n**EDITORIALS** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ COVID-19 and the Shipowner's Legal Obligations ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/covid-19-and-the-shipowner-s-legal-obligations)\n\n  * #####  [ The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Shipping ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-shipping)\n\n  * #####  [ Saudis Invest in Carnival Corporation ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/saudis-invest-in-carnival-corporation)\n\n  * #####  [ Remembering the U.S. Merchant Marine's Sacrifice in a Time of Crisis ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/remembering-the-u-s-merchant-marine-s-sacrifice-in-a-time-of-crisis)\n\n  * #####  [ Op-Ed: Call Someone Who is Alone ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-call-someone-who-is-alone)\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n  * [Print](/subscribe)\n  * [Digital](/subscribe)\n  * [Newsletter](/subscribe)\n  * [Renew](/subscriber/send_subscriber_email)\n\n[Subscribe Now](/subscribe)\n\n**RELATED** STORIES\n\n[Shipping](/shipping-news)\n\n[ ![file photo](/media/images/article/Photos/Oil_Gas_Energy/power-plant-\njapan.aa42ae.jpg) ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/woodside-joins-\njapanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\n##  [Woodside Joins Japanese Green Hydrogen Consortium](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/article/woodside-joins-japanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\nBy **[ The Maritime Executive ](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/author/marex) ** 04-07-2020 10:08:27\n\nAustralian energy company Woodside has signed an agreement with Japanese\ncompanies JERA Inc, Marubeni Corporation and IHI Corporation to undertake a\njoint study examining the large-scale export of hydrogen as ammonia for use\ndecarbonising coal-fired power generation in Japan.

So I think the timing is immense and if you get\nthe right application and tools they can be incredibly helpful.\"\n\nThe problem, however, is that while a select number of Canadian firms have\nsuccessfully utilized hedging strategies, a host of firms who do not have that\nexperience will now be entering the space.\n\nPicton said that advisors who had previously shied away from this area will be\nleft grappling with a new product suite from some unfamiliar providers. He\nsaid there are three steps asset managers should walk through to ensure proper\ndue diligence to determine how best to use these new liquid alt funds.\n\nHe said: \"The first thing I'd start with is why you want to use this? What is\nthe net benefit to the investor here? What risks are you trying to protect?\nWhat diversification angle are you trying to take advantage of? That's the\neasy part.\n\n\"Once you sort that out, you'll be able to cut through all these different\nproducts that are being released to narrow it down to the specific ones that\nare trying to solve the equation for you.\"\n\nPicton said if you wanted an income-related stream but were afraid of interest\nrates going up, an alternative product could protect against this while still\ngiving you access to income. Alternatively, you may be less worried about the\nmarket but want more diversification in the equity space.\n\nThe next stage, he said, is to analyse the manufacturer's track record. How\ndid they do through 2008? Or the taper tantrum of 2013? How did this product,\nthat is going to be replicated in this new alternative framework, do?\n\nThe last part of the process, said Picton, is doing a deep dive into the\ncharacteristics of the firm.\n\nHe said: \"What kind of risk processes do they have that assures me you either\nhave experience with them or you're not going to get way offside and give me\nsomething, some unintended consequence that should never have happened.\"\n\nWhile Picton joked that he hopes his funds become the staple of all good\nportfolios, he expects there will be an incubation period in Canada because\nits hedge fund industry is not as developed as in the US.\n\nHe said: \"There is not as much awareness, quite frankly, of how these things\nwork. Bigger market impact may have to wait for the market to season or,\nunfortunately, maybe a bad event where some of these products show their true\nvalue as diversifiers in a portfolio.\"\n\n**PICTION MAHONEY 'S NEW FUNDS  \nPicton Mahoney Fortified Active Extension Alternative Fund**\n\nDesigned to provide long-term capital appreciation and style diversification\nfor equity portfolios, with an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return and\nsimilar volatility to traditional equity markets.\n\n**Picton Mahoney Fortified Market Neutral Alternative Fund**  \nDesigned to provide consistent long-term capital appreciation and an\nattractive risk-adjusted rate of return, with less volatility and low\ncorrelation to traditional equity markets.\n\n**Picton Mahoney Fortified Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund**  \nDesigned to provide consistent capital appreciation with an attractive risk-\nadjusted rate of return, with low correlation to traditional balanced or\ndiversified strategies.\n\n_Follow WP on[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WealthProCA/),\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wealth-professional-canada/) and\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wealthproca?lang=en)_\n\n\n\n### LATEST NEWS\n\n  * [Ottawa has pledged to help businesses but will it be too late?](/news/industry-news/ottawa-has-pledged-to-help-businesses-but-will-it-be-too-late/328467)\n  * [Financial services firms spend US$181bn a year on this globally](/news/industry-news/financial-services-firms-spend-us181bn-a-year-on-this-globally/328466)\n  * [Why clients should treat COVID-19 as a retirement drill](/news/industry-news/why-clients-should-treat-covid-19-as-a-retirement-drill/328409)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of\nwealth.

Additionally, PayU will invest $200 million in the\nnew venture over the next two years, with $65 million being invested\nimmediately. PaySense boasts over 5.5 million customers and had raised $25.6\nmillion prior to this announcement, with PayU already participating in the\nfintech's Series B funding round in 2018.\n\nThe acquisition can help PayU further diversify its offering, and the new\nventure will likely be in high demand in India.\n\nBy merging LazyPay and PaySense, PayU can offer its users a wider set of\nservices. PaySense allows consumers to take out long-term credit for financing\npurchases including new vehicles, with personal loan options of up to INR\n500,000 ($7,046). LazyPay, on the other hand, focuses more on short-term\ncredit to facilitate order on food delivery platforms and e-commerce websites,\nwith credit options of up to INR 100,000 ($1,409).\n\nThe companies are building a shared technology infrastructure for the two\nservices, though they'll initially continue to run independently. PayU's\ntarget for the new service is to disburse \"a couple of billion dollars\" in\ncredit to consumers over the next five years, per TechCrunch citing Siddhartha\nJajodia, global head of credit at PayU. Additionally, PayU is exploring\nbuilding new services with the new venture, including credit for small- and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nMany consumers in India don't have access to appropriate means of financing,\nand interest in the new venture will likely be high.

__\n\n[Zycus](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/zycus-salesforce-\ncustomer-outreach/), which provides a comprehensive, end-to-end source-to-pay\nsoftware suite in which it uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology, now\nhas a new series of BOTs from its Zycus Merlin AI Suite, according to a [press\nrelease](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zycus-transforms-source-pay-\nlandscape-074100600.html).\n\nThe BOTs will allow procurement and accounts payable (AP) teams to automate\ntasks considered mundane or repetitive.\n\nOne of the tasks that will be able to be automated is invoice intake, in which\nkey data will be automatically extracted. Businesses will be able to automate\nthe sorting and classifying emails and auto-generating responses via AI. The\nprocess of intelligently identifying and analyzing contractual texts will also\nbe automated by the suite.\n\nThe BOTs will also allow for identifying contract clauses in an automated way.\nReview scores will be highlighted at a contract level.\n\nZycus has been working in AI technology for over 20 years, and its first\npatent was filed in 2002 using the tech. Zycus\u2019 Merlin AI Suite will take\nimportant steps toward AI-led intelligent procurement and will be a \u201cgame\nchanger\u201d for procurement and AP operations, the press release states.\n\nBy using the Merlin AI Suite, companies will be able to complete many tasks\nwith \u201clittle or no human intervention\u201d so that transactions are truly\nautonomous.\n\nZycus CEO Aatish Dedhia said AI capabilities are central to Zycus\u2019 product\nroadmap. He said the standout feature of the company\u2019s product is the deep\nunderstanding the company has for the technology, as well as \u201csignificant\nfocus and investment\u201d in people, product and technology. The company also\noffers access to real customers\u2019 data for training.\n\nAs [AI](https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2020/ai-and-manual-fraud-\nreview/)\u2019s proficiency and prominence grows, it is seen increasingly as a way\nfor businesses to optimize quickness, efficiency and profit, and the challenge\nwill be in developing tools that can address every level of a business\u2019s\nneeds, including fraud detection and more.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

It monitors, collects and records configuration changes across the enterprise and verifies their adherence to the unified security policy, helping users visualize the resulting compliance gaps and related vulnerabilities. Tufin uses topology intelligence to map out resources and connections, even across fragmented, complex networks, allowing users to quickly troubleshoot broken connectivity and ensure business continuity.\n\n### **Insight and Analysis**\n\n **IT Central Station** has several reviews of Tufin Orchestration Suite. [Go\nhere to read them](https://www.itcentralstation.com/products/tufin-reviews).\nHere's a sample comment:\n\n**How has Tufin helped my organization? \"** With path analysis, you can\nspecify a source, a destination, and a port and it will tell you whether it's\nblocked or not, and where; which firewall is doing the blocking or the\nallowing, or whatever. That part is very useful. When you have feedback from\nthe user and you have your source, destination, and port, instead of trying to\nsearch on the Check Point console or the Panorama console or the Juniper\nconsole to figure out where that packet being dropped, you go to Tufin, put it\nin and, in 30 seconds, you have your answer.\n\n\"It saves time on each ticket. Instead of playing around for 15 or 20 minutes,\nit's down to 30 seconds. Any first-line of support can go to Tufin, put in the\nsource, destination, and port and they can at least know what to look for, who\nto involve to further troubleshoot the issue. It's a first-step investigation\nthat saves time.\n\n\"It also helps us ensure that our security policies are followed across our\nentire hybrid network.\"\n\n**Gartner Peer Reviews** has [four\nreviews](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/review/view/746585) of Tufin's\nOrchestration Suite. Here's one sample comment:\n\n**Overall Comment: \"** We have been using Tufin for three plus years now.\nSecure Change and Secure Track. Both work well, integrate with AD for\nauthentication of users, Taccas and Radius for authentication to devices. The\nNetwork map it creates is helpful for many things, and can be exported to\nVisio. The Secure Change is excellent for tracking and approving all firewall\nchanges and validating they were implemented correctly.\"\n\n**What do you like most about the product or service?** \"Ensure the VM meets\nor exceeds the specs provided. Also use a separate service account for device\nauditing.\"\n\n**What do you dislike most about the product or service?** \"GUI is not\n'modern,' meaning that where you think some administration settings are, they\nare not. Small inconvenience, but not overly difficult once you know where to\nlook.\"\n\n**What one piece of advice would you give other prospective customers?** \"Make\nsure that you have Secure Track setup before deploying Secure Change, so the\nchange validation works smoothly.\"\n\n**eWEEK score, based on aggregate reviews: 4.6/5.0**\n\n**\\-------------------------------------------**\n\n**List of current users:**\n\n  * RWE\n  * Capital One\n  * Slovak Telekom\n  * Fujitsu\n  * Swisscom\n  * Salt River Project\n  * Virgin Media\n  * TransUnion\n  * Telenor\n  * Monext\n  * Six Group\n  * Axpo\n  * BMW\n  * Ensono\n\n**Delivery** : Tufin Orchestration Suite is typically installed on-premises\nusing a pre-installed appliance ([Tufin offers three appliance models for\ndifferent customer deployment\nscenarios](http://web.tufin.com/hubfs/resources/products/Tufin_T-\nseries_appliance_Datasheet.pdf)) or as a virtual appliance on a VM.

This acquisition enables us to actively support clients and\nadvisers achieve this,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be completed within August 2019 pending certain\ncustomary conditions and some key personnel arrangements. Midwinter's founders\nand senior management will remain a core part of the business.\n\nBravura also reported its FY2019 results, with product sales driving revenue\nand profit growth.\n\nRevenue for the year ended 30 June 2019 came in at $257.7 million, up 16\npercent from $221.5 million the previous year. Net profit after tax is $32.8\nmillion, up 21 percent from $27 million in FY2018. EBITDA is also up 27\npercent while margins also increased from 17.4 percent to 19 percent.\n\nOn a per segment basis, Wealth Management revenue is up 14 percent to $176.8\nmillion, while Funds Administration revenue is $80.9 million, up 22 percent\nfrom $66.4 million.\n\n\"Bravura has again achieved an outstanding set of full year results,\" Tony\nKlim said.\n\n\"The FY19 result was driven by robust demand across the Bravura product suite\ncombined with operating leverage expansion. We have seen continued and\nsignificant project work from our existing client base, in addition to several\nnew contract wins.\"\n\nGot a news tip for our journalists?

CMSs have simplified content and website\nmanagement while providing robust security, on-page SEO, and automation\nfeatures. CMSs are highly flexible and allow you to improve the website\nexperience by integrating third-party extensions or plugins. In this article,\nwe\u2019ll look at the ten best content management systems (CMS) in 2020._**\n\n![](https://images.martechadvisor.com/100x130/images/uploads/native_assets_images/aspire_iq_native_ad_5dcbd072182e0.jpeg)\n\n### CONTENT THAT CONNECTS: WHY INFLUENCER MARKETING IS THE FUTURE OF GEN Z\nENGAGEMENT\n\nGen Z is a business opportunity you can\u2019t afford to miss. As 40% of the\npopulation commanding upwards of $40 billion in spending power, modern\nmarketers need to build compelling strategies to engage with Gen Z.\n\n[Download](https://assets.martechadvisor.com/research/content-that-connects-\nwhy-influencer-marketing-is-the-future-of-gen-z-\nengagement-138766?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## How to Pick the Right CMS?\n\nChoosing a CMS that is suitable for your organization, website, and team\nstructure is a critical decision. In this section, we\u2019ll look at a few\nprerequisites that will help you pick the right CMS.\n\n### 1\\. Business Goals  \n\nBegin by understanding your business goals and their respective marketing\nobjectives. It\u2019s imperative to involve stakeholders from the IT and marketing\ndepartments since they\u2019ll be the primary users of the CMS. Answering questions\nsuch as the organization\u2019s expansion plans and how you intend to drive traffic\nto the website will help you decide on a set of must-have features. For\ninstance, if you\u2019re planning to enter a new market, you might need a\nmultilingual website.\n\nCreate a set of use cases to identify the requirements of additional features\nthat you may have missed.\n\n### 2\\. Usability  \n\nThe biggest strength of a CMS is its usability. Marketers, writers, and\ndesigners primarily manage website content. These users may not necessarily\nhave the programming chops to write lines of code to add, edit, format, or\ndelete content. Therefore, the CMS should be easy-to-use, even for non-tech\nsavvy people. It should have a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor\nthat makes it easy to add text content, rich media, and embed third-party\ncontent such as videos and social media posts.\n\n### 3\\. SEO-Friendliness  \n\nThe CMS you choose should provide features to enhance your SEO efforts. Some\nof these features include customizable permalink structure, XML site map,\nability to add title tag, meta description, alt text, etc. Many CMS software\nallows you to add third-party extensions that offer additional features to\ncustomize these SEO attributes at scale.\n\n**Learn More:[What Is a Content Management System (CMS)? Definition, Key\nfunctions, Best Practices with\nExamples](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/digital-asset-\nmanagement/what-is-content-management-system-cms-definition-functions-best-\npractices/) **\n\n### 4\\. Pricing  \n\nThe cost of your CMS will depend on several factors. The first of them is\nwhether you're building or buying. Corporations with precise requirements may\ndevelop their own CMS. Building a CMS can be an expensive choice. Some open-\nsource CMSs also let you build or customize on top of their layout.\n\nThe next is, on-premise versus cloud-based CMS. On-premise CMS tends to get\npricey due to the infrastructure, maintenance, and scalability aspects. Cloud-\nbased CMS alternatives are relatively easy-to-implement, scalable, and come\nwith a subscription fee.\n\n### 5\\. Security  \n\nOne of the biggest concerns with CMS software platforms is that they're\nvulnerable to security attacks. Therefore, ensure that the CMS you\u2019re choosing\nhas adequate safeguards to ward off security attacks. For instance, although\nWordPress websites have been victims of hacks in the past, plenty of third-\nparty security plugins are available that you can integrate to increase the\nsecurity of your website.\n\n### 6\\. Customizations  \n\nTake stock of the current tools in your martech stack and check whether the\nCMS provides integration capabilities with those tools. For instance, if\nyou\u2019re using an email marketing tool, it should be able to integrate with the\nCMS so that new subscribers through the website are automatically added to the\nlist. Similarly, tracking website visitors shouldn\u2019t be too complex. Just\nadding a plugin or a snippet of code should let you track visitor behavior in\nGoogle Analytics or similar web analytics software.\n\n### 7\\. Technical Support  \n\nCheck out the technical support provided by the CMS. If you\u2019re using a SaaS\nCMS such as Squarespace, you\u2019ll get a 24/7 support team, whereas, for an open-\nsource CMS, you may have to rely on their forums to get help from fellow CMS\nusers.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Customer Experience (CX)? Definition, Design,\nManagement, Best Practices and\nExamples](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/customer-experience-2/what-\nis-customer-experience-strategy-best-practices-trends/)**\n\n## Top 10 Content Management System (CMS) Software for 2020\n\nNow that we know the prerequisites for picking the right CMS, let\u2019s look at\nthe top 10 content management system (CMS) software for 2020:\n\n### 1\\. WordPress  \n\nWordPress.org was launched in 2003 and has simplified website development for\neveryone. It started as a blogging platform and has now grown into a full-\nblown CMS platform to the extent that 35% of the active websites now use\nWordPress. It is also a favorite among bloggers due to its design and easy to\nuse framework.\n\nWordPress is the leader in the CMS category for two main reasons:\n\n  1. It\u2019s a free and open-source application, which means not only you can use it for free but you can also fine-tune its code to suit your requirements.\n  2. A wide range of customization options right from aesthetics and user interface (UI) to third-party integrations.  \n\nWhile WordPress offers a variety of free themes, you can also buy third-party\nthemes. WordPress lets you use plugins to help you extend its feature set and\nintegrate different applications with the website to automate the workflow.\n\nAutomattic, the parent company of WordPress, also offers an open-source\ne-commerce plugin called WooCommerce to help you set up an online store\nwithout any technical complexities.\n\nOne key concern with WordPress is that it has been notorious for its security\nvulnerabilities. Therefore, if you choose to go with WordPress, make sure that\nyou update the CMS and plugins regularly.\n\n### 2\\. Drupal  \n\nDrupal is another free and open-source CMS software that is common across\nindustries such as fintech, sports, entertainment, education, healthcare,\ne-commerce, media and publishing, and NGOs. The Drupal community has 1.39\nmillion members, out of which 117,000 active contributors have built over\n44,000 free modules (third-party integrations) and 2,800 free themes to extend\nthe website\u2019s functionality.\n\nThe basic version of Drupal, known as Drupal core, offers basic CMS features\nand can be used to build blogs, online forums, or user-generated content\nwebsites.\n\nAlthough Drupal is known to be not-a-beginner-friendly CMS, some of its\nfeatures such as security, taxonomy system, multilingual site support, and\ncustom post creation are too powerful to be ignored. It\u2019s recommended to have\nan experienced web developer to manage the Drupal website as it can be a bit\ndifficult to manage and update it from a technical standpoint.\n\nDrupal currently has modules for martech products such as Tableau, Salesforce,\nMailchimp, HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Shopify.\n\n### 3\\. Joomla\n\nSimilar to WordPress and Drupal, Joomla is another widely used free and open-\nsource CMS. Over 2 million websites use Joomla as its CMS. Joomla has a\ncommunity of 1,500+ active volunteers that have developed more than 10,000\nextensions and templates.\n\nJoomla is a powerful CMS if your content strategy involves a diverse content\nmix. The CMS is mobile-friendly, supports multilingual websites, provides\nmulti-level user permissions, and can provide a thorough set of features\nwithout the need for third-party integrations/extensions.\n\nCompared to WordPress and other CMS such as Squarespace or Wix, Joomla comes\nwith a steep learning curve and is not a beginner-friendly CMS. However,\nJoomla provides a comprehensive documentation/user manual and video training\nclasses if you\u2019re willing to learn on your own.\n\n### 4\\. Squarespace\n\nSquarespace is known for its intuitive and ridiculously simple drag-and-drop\nwebsite builder that lets you build an aesthetic website interface. The CMS is\nused primarily by SMBs, entrepreneurs, musicians, restaurants, and bloggers.\nSquarespace acts as a one-stop-shop for users by providing all essential\nwebsite ingredients such as domain name, web hosting, SSL certificate,\nextensions, etc. right from its basic pricing plans.\n\nSquarespace comes with a built-in repository of mobile-friendly themes that\nyou can modify using CSS. You can also use the style editor to customize\nfonts, colors, and other theme settings. Squarespace offers basic image\nmanipulation features to enable you to edit images on the fly. You can assign\nmultiple contributors and assign different access rights to ensure that\nwebsite management doesn\u2019t become complicated.\n\nThe basic plan starts at $16 per month. If you subscribe to its business ($26\nper month) and other advanced plans, you can also set up an e-commerce store\nthat comes with tiered features based on the plan.\n\nWhile Squarespace is an excellent choice for smaller websites, it may not suit\nyour requirements as you scale your content efforts in the longer run.\n\n### 5\\. Wix\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a CMS in the same vein of Squarespace, Wix is the\nanswer. You can either build your website from the ground up or pick a design\nfrom the repository of 500 readymade theme templates. The premium plan offers\na custom domain name, personalized email, web hosting, analytics, contact\nmanagement, and an SSL certificate.\n\nOne of the strongest suits of Wix is its range of features that make it easy\nfor different types of businesses to set up a website. For instance, online\nstores can accept payments via multiple methods, provide coupons and\ndiscounts, and track orders in real-time. Similarly, restaurants can create\nmenus, set up online ordering, and let users book tables through the website.\n\nWhile the basic plan starts at $13 per month, its business plans start at $23\nper month and go up to $500 per month.\n\n### 6\\. HubSpot CMS\n\nHubSpot CMS is the perfect choice for companies that prefer relying on a\nconsolidated martech stack for their marketing requirements. Although HubSpot\nis a well-known marketing automation provider, it also offers a CMS that\nintegrates with the entire HubSpot product suite.\n\nUsers can create, manage, and track the performance of blog articles, landing\npages, and emails from one place. Drag-and-drop modules, SEO features, mobile-\nfriendly themes, and content staging simplify the content creation process.\nThe CMS also provides calls-to-action (CTAs), live chat, chatbot, smart\ncontent, and forms to help brands personalize the experience. HubSpot CMS also\ncomes with a built-in analytics tool that tracks website performance, such as\ntraffic sources, bounce rate, etc. Since the CMS can be integrated with the\nCRM, it can help you personalize the page content based on the visitor\u2019s\ntraits.\n\nThe pricing starts at $300 per month, with a one-time onboarding fee of\n$1,000.\n\n### 7\\. Adobe Experience Manager Sites  \n\nAdobe Experience Manager Sites is a part of Adobe Experience Manager. The CMS\nprovides a drag-and-drop interface, template editor, marketing-friendly\ntemplates, and developer-facing tools to help you create a new website or app.\nAdobe Experience Manager Sites enables you to create marketing sites, customer\nportals, and employee intranets.\n\nThe cross-channel content feature lets you create content and deliver it to\nyour customers beyond web and mobile devices.

The AI-powered technology\nscales it so that it is uniform across the entire customer segment.\n\nYou can get in touch with Adobe\u2019s sales team for a customized quote.\n\n### 8\\. Magento\n\nMagneto is a widely used open-source CMS in the e-commerce niche. The CMS\ncomes with a drag-and-drop page builder to help you deliver an optimal\nshopping experience. The content staging platform also allows you to schedule\nwebsite updates so that you don\u2019t have to involve the IT department to roll-\nout newer versions.

Or an affordable yet powerful tool?\n\nBy [Steve Paris](https://www.techradar.com/author/steve-paris) 16 July 2019\n\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/affinity-publisher)\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Affinity%20Publisher%20DTP%20software%20review&url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/affinity-publisher)\n  * [ __](whatsapp://send?text=Affinity%20Publisher%20DTP%20software%20reviewhttps://www.techradar.com/reviews/affinity-publisher?fwa)\n  * [ __](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/affinity-publisher&media=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLVt5VzGuFp2sHpDtxNuue-1200-80.jpg)\n  * [ __](mailto:?subject=I%20found%20this%20webpage&body=Hi,%20I%20found%20this%20webpage%20and%20thought%20you%20might%20like%20it%20https://www.techradar.com/reviews/affinity-publisher)\n\n__ Shares\n\n![Affinity\nPublisher](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLVt5VzGuFp2sHpDtxNuue-480-80.jpg)\n\nImage credit: Serif\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Serif)\n\n### Our Verdict\n\nDesktop publishing is as much about layout as it is about image manipulation,\nand Affinity Publisher brings all the tools you need to the table (as long as\nyou\u2019ve purchased the other two apps as well), to give you a powerful and\nelegant solution. If a version 1 product is this good, Affinity could become a\nserious contender in a few years.\n\n####  For\n\n  * Affordable \n  * Full featured \n  * Seamless access to Affinity Photo and Designer tools \n\n####  Against\n\n  * Cannot read InDesign INDD files \n  * Cannot yet read InDesign IDML files \n  * \n\nLong ago there was a behemoth desktop publishing app, and anyone serious about\ndesign layout used it. Betting against it was a fool\u2019s errand: Quark Xpress\nreigned supreme.\n\nThen a little upstart company which achieved good success with its photo\nediting software thought it\u2019d throw its hat into the ring. Adobe\u2019s original\nendeavor, while praised for resolving long-standing issues, was also\nridiculed, because how can anyone hope to compete with the current champion?\nThat little upstart app was InDesign, and we all know where Adobe now stands\nwhen it comes to catering for all the needs of image creatives.\n\nSerif is a small British company with ambitious goals. Under its 'Affinity\u2019\nbanner, the company has already released a Photoshop competitor \u2013 Affinity\nPhoto \u2013 and an Illustrator competitor \u2013 Affinity Designer. Both of these apps\nare available for Mac, Windows and iPad.\n\nLast month, Serif released its latest salvo, setting its sights squarely on\nInDesign with Affinity Publisher.\n\nPricing is unbelievably competitive. Unlike [Adobe\u2019s subscription\nplans](https://www.techradar.com/news/save-a-huge-40-off-adobe-creative-\ncloud), all Affinity apps are available for a one-off affordable price:\n\u00a348.99/$49.99 each, for either Mac or Windows (iPad versions of Photo and\nDesigner sell for \u00a319.99/$19.99). Free trials are also available for the\ndesktop versions, so there\u2019s no reason not to check them out.\n\n![Affinity\nPublisher](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nDrag an image or a text box around, and the content alters instantly (Image\ncredit: Serif) (Image credit: Serif)\n\n## Powerful and affordable\n\nThis review is about Publisher, but we have to mention Photo and Designer as\nwell, for reasons that will become clear later on.\n\nSo how good is Publisher at desktop publishing?\n\nLooking at Serif\u2019s website, it seems like it\u2019s covering all the bases, with\nsupport for multiple types of image formats (such as AI, JPEG, PDF, PMG, PSD\nor TIFF), and tools we\u2019ve all come to expect from any DTP suite. The latter\nincludes text styles, text on a path, OpenType support, flow options to avoid\norphaned or widowed lines, advanced guides and grids, support for double page\nspreads, master pages, and so forth.\n\nBut an app is more than the sum of its features. So, how does Designer\nactually handle?\n\nConsidering it\u2019s a brand new app, released in late June 2019 (despite the fact\nit\u2019s already at version 1.7.1), it runs remarkably well.\n\nEverything feels quick and responsive. Moving an image warps the text\ninstantly, so you can see the changes and be as precise as you need to be,\neven on an old computer (we tested it on a 2014 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM\nand an ever-dwindling amount of storage space).\n\nThis kind of responsiveness and on-the-fly changes are felt throughout.\nHighlight some text for instance, and as you scroll over different fonts, you\ncan see the highlighted text update before you even click on your selected\nfont. The change is instant and this is a great way to choose the perfect font\nfor your needs.\n\nAll of this is nice and all, and could entice some folks on a budget to try\nthe app out as a means of avoiding an ongoing Adobe subscription, but\nresponsiveness and elegance isn\u2019t really a killer feature.\n\nBut what comes next may well be\u2026\n\n![Affinity\nPublisher](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nMousing over fonts in the menu is a quick and convenient way to preview fonts\ndirectly on your layout (Image credit: Serif) (Image credit: Serif)\n\n## Seamless integration\n\nHow many times have you had to cycle through apps to get your work done? Say\nyou add a photo to your page layout but need to tweak it in some way, do some\ncolor correction or image manipulation. So you have to hop to your image\nediting app, save your changes, perhaps even reimport it back into your DTP\nprogram\u2026\n\nSerif has found a solution to this merry-go-round: get rid of it altogether.\nThis is a feature they call Studio Link.\n\nWhat this does is actually pretty clever. If you have Affinity Photo and/or\nDesigner installed on your machine, you can access these apps\u2019 tools directly\nwithin Publisher. Essentially you never have to leave Publisher when working\non a project, and this has the advantage of keeping you totally immersed in\nthe layout creation process, making image alterations you know will work\nperfectly with the rest of your pages.\n\nThe way it functions is really simple. Top-left of the interface are the three\nAffinity app icons. Click on the Photo or Designer icon to change Publisher\u2019s\n'persona\u2019, which means the tools are changed from Publisher\u2019s to those of the\nother apps.\n\nIt works surprisingly well.\n\nNot only does this speed up your editing processes, but the switch between\npersonas is so effortless it becomes second nature to swap between tools in\nthat manner.\n\n![Affinity\nPublisher](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nUse all the tools from Affinity Photo and Designer directly from within\nPublisher (Image credit: Serif) (Image credit: Serif)\n\n## Compatibility issues\n\nAnother important feature of this trio of apps is that their file format is\nidentical. Yes, they may be labelled .afphoto, .afdesigner, and .afpub, but\nthat\u2019s to ensure that when you double-click on a file, it will open in the\nright app. However, you can open any file in any app if you want to.\n\nNot all tools are present in all apps, though: Studio Link is only available\nthrough Publisher, but it means that you could pass on your files to other\nusers who may not have the Publisher app, and they\u2019ll still be able to preview\nyour work and make some changes if need be.\n\nThis also means that the current iPad apps can open and read Publisher\ndocuments. An iPad version of Publisher is in the works which Serif hopes to\nhave ready by next year, and it will be bringing Studio Link to that platform\nas well.\n\nThis tight integration is a huge plus, as long as you stick to this suite of\napps. However, compatibility doesn\u2019t extend to Designer\u2019s competition: it\ncan\u2019t read InDesign INDD files. This isn\u2019t surprising since that format\u2019s\nproprietary, but it could hinder your dreams of untethering yourself from\nAdobe, if you or your clients deal with InDesign files.\n\nYou may be interested to know though, that Serif are working on offering\ncompatibility with IDML files - a format many who work with InDesign use to\nensure compatibility between different versions of InDesign - but as of right\nnow, that feature isn\u2019t yet available.\n\nIf you\u2019re used to Adobe\u2019s apps, you will also have to alter your way of\nworking. A lot of keyboard shortcuts are the same, but when you select part of\nan image, for instance, you can\u2019t use the Shift and Alt keys to add or\nsubtract from your selection \u2013 you have a couple of buttons for that instead.\nSome differences are to be expected, of course, and shouldn\u2019t detract from the\npower available in Publisher.\n\nAlthough Mac users will notice the distinct lack of support for their\npreferred computer\u2019s system-wide auto-save feature, Affinity Press has its own\nversion built-in. You can even alter its File Recovery Interval option in the\nPreferences - by default, it saves a copy of your work every 5 minutes.\n\n![Affinity\nPublisher](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nYou can also open a Publisher document in other Affinity apps, and even\nperform some alterations (Image credit: Serif) (Image credit: Serif)\n\n## Final verdict\n\nAs the new kid on the block, Affinity Publisher cannot hope to unseat the\ncurrent DTP champion. However, what\u2019s available now shows immense promise, and\nif your workflow doesn\u2019t require compatibility with InDesign files, then you\nshould definitely give Publisher, and its two companion apps, a serious look.\n\n  * We\u2019ve picked out all the [best DTP software](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-dtp-software) of 2019\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

BASS, the leading provider of\nmaritime software solutions, is pleased that Wallem has selected the complete\nsuite of integrated software to manage their entire fleet.  \n  \nThe signing of Wallem marks a key milestone for BASS, signaling a wider move\nto complete enterprise solutions in the maritime industry as a means to\neffectively standardize ship processes. Wallem has chosen to use BASSnet\u2122 as a\ntotal solution for maintenance, safety, operational and financial management,\namong others, on a fleet-wide basis. The integrated nature, superior\nfunctionality and clear technological strategy of BASSnet\u2122 were of pivotal\nimportance in Wallem's decision to sign with BASS.  \n  \nFrank Coles, CEO of Wallem Group said, \"Having run several maritime software\ncompanies and considering the complexities of operations, compliance and the\nregulatory environment, I was keen to not reinvent the wheel.\"  Coles added,\n\"We have chosen to install a cloud based COTS solution, without customization.\nExactly how digitalisation is supposed to be done.  We are going to defy the\nmyth that ship operations and management needs to be different, or somehow\nspecial.  It does not need all the disparate or heavily customized homegrown\nsystems.  This is the stuff of myths created by a lack of understanding and/or\nold fashioned operational beliefs and techniques.\"  \n  \nColes concluded, \"In my view, offering transparency, analytics and business\nintelligence is the way forward for high-performance fleet management, and\nimplementing a complete enterprise solution from BASSnet\u2122 will allow us to\nintegrate the power of big data with our business processes.  We are going to\nwalk the talk.\"  \n  \n\"BASSnet\u2122 Fleet Management Systems is a complete solution that removes the\nreliance on multiple vendors for piecemeal software,\" noted Per Steinar\nUpsaker, CEO and Managing Director of BASS. \"We have prioritized a well-\nthought-out strategy that is forward-looking, comprehensive and puts BASSnet\u2122\nin a unique position. This includes the incredible convenience and security of\nmanaging an entire fleet using a single database on a state of the art\nplatform.\"  \n  \nUpsaker continued, \"BASSnet's modular features are augmented by progressive\nand responsive web applications and mobile apps, and we have made data\ncollection and analysis a priority, providing an invaluable bird's eye view of\nfleet performance and areas for improvement. Data-driven systems mean higher\ntransparency and visibility,\" he added. \"This makes BASSnet\u2122 the ideal one-\nstop solution to streamline and increase fleet efficiency, asset management,\nand safety.\"\n\nThe products and services herein described in this press release are not\nendorsed by The Maritime Executive.\n\n**MORE** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ ABS Leads EU-Funded Study on the Future of the EEDI ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/abs-leads-eu-funded-study-on-the-future-of-the-eedi)\n\n  * #####  [ North Sea, U.S. Gulf Producers Work to Keep COVID-19 Off Platforms ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/north-sea-u-s-gulf-producers-work-to-keep-covid-19-off-platforms)\n\n  * #####  [ USNS Comfort to Accept COVID-19 Patients ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/usns-comfort-to-accept-covid-19-patients)\n\n  * #####  [ RightShip and Human Rights at Sea Join Forces ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/rightship-and-human-rights-at-sea-join-forces)\n\n**EDITORIALS** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ COVID-19 and the Shipowner's Legal Obligations ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/covid-19-and-the-shipowner-s-legal-obligations)\n\n  * #####  [ The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Shipping ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-shipping)\n\n  * #####  [ Saudis Invest in Carnival Corporation ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/saudis-invest-in-carnival-corporation)\n\n  * #####  [ Remembering the U.S. Merchant Marine's Sacrifice in a Time of Crisis ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/remembering-the-u-s-merchant-marine-s-sacrifice-in-a-time-of-crisis)\n\n  * #####  [ Op-Ed: Call Someone Who is Alone ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-call-someone-who-is-alone)\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n  * [Print](/subscribe)\n  * [Digital](/subscribe)\n  * [Newsletter](/subscribe)\n  * [Renew](/subscriber/send_subscriber_email)\n\n[Subscribe Now](/subscribe)\n\n**RELATED** STORIES\n\n[Shipping](/shipping-news)\n\n[ ![file photo](/media/images/article/Photos/Oil_Gas_Energy/power-plant-\njapan.aa42ae.jpg) ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/woodside-joins-\njapanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\n##  [Woodside Joins Japanese Green Hydrogen Consortium](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/article/woodside-joins-japanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\nBy **[ The Maritime Executive ](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/author/marex) ** 04-07-2020 10:08:27\n\nAustralian energy company Woodside has signed an agreement with Japanese\ncompanies JERA Inc, Marubeni Corporation and IHI Corporation to undertake a\njoint study examining the large-scale export of hydrogen as ammonia for use\ndecarbonising coal-fired power generation in Japan.

Enterprises Need to Know About Getting Started with AI/ML\n\nEdited by:  [Chris Preimesberger, eWEEK](/Authors/chris-preimesberger \"Posts\nby Chris Preimesberger\") |  September 26, 2019\n\neWEEK DATA POINTS RESOURCE PAGE: Effective use of both AI and Ml in business\nproduction use cases can help enterprises that use them jump far ahead of\ncompetitors in their sectors, because the technologies remove friction that\ngums up processes.\n\n**Download the authoritative guide:[Leading Big Data Vendors: Solutions to\nPower

around the world are investing tens of billions of dollars on\nartificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and for good reason.\nThese technologies have real business-altering potential, and that\u2019s why\nGartner\u2019s \"Enter the Age of Analytics\" report predicts that by 2023, AI and\ndeep-learning techniques will be the two most common approaches for new\napplications of data science.\n\nEffective use of both AI and ML in business production use cases can help\nenterprises that use them jump far ahead of competitors in their sectors,\nbecause the technologies remove friction that gums up processes. But despite\nthis promise, few companies have been able to successfully implement and\ndeploy this technology as part of their overall data and analytics strategy.\nAccording to Gartner, 46 percent of CIOs have developed plans to deploy AI,\nbut just 4 percent have made the concept a reality.\n\n_**Go here to see a listing of eWEEK's[Top Predictive Analytics\nCompanies](https://www.eweek.com/big-data-and-analytics/eweek-s-\ntop-10-vendors-for-predictive-analytics).**_\n\nThe truth is that it will take years before many organizations realize the\ntrue potential of AI and ML, but it is never too early to lay the groundwork\nnow for an AI-driven future. In fact, if an organization is not already\nthinking about what an AI strategy looks like, its competition is likely one\nstep ahead. There\u2019s no time to waste, so here are five important points to\nconsider when getting started with AI and ML.\n\n#### Further reading\n\n  * [ How CI/CD Accelerates Machine Learning Model Development ](/big-data-and-analytics/how-to-accelerate-machine-learning-model-development-in-the-enterprise)\n  * [ #eWEEKchat March 11: What's Up with New-Gen Health... ](/big-data-and-analytics/eweekchat-march-11-what-s-up-with-new-gen-health-care-it)\n\nIndustry information for this _eWEEK_ Data Points article is provided by\nAshley Kramer, Senior Vice President of Product at Alteryx. Alteryx claims\nthat its product suite is the only platform in the market that simultaneously\naddresses the requirements of the data analyst, data scientist and citizen\ndata scientist.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 1: Ask the right questions**\n\nThere are four things organizations need to be thinking about when it comes to\na future-proof data strategy. What data is available within the walls of my\norganization? What data do we need to acquire externally to drive\ndifferentiation? Is our data available in a way that can be readily available\nfor machine learning and AI? And perhaps most importantly: Where can we\nupskill our line-of-business, what requires pure data science and AI know-how,\nand what can IT manage? The answer to these questions should serve as the\nfoundation to your strategy.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 2: Take a multi-year approach**\n\nSuccessful AI/ML implementation does not happen overnight. The smartest\norganizations take a multi-year approach to data acquisition and strategy,\nfocused on compiling data from different sources and silos\u2014often built around\na Center of Excellence (CoE)\u2014and investing in the right technologies and\npeople to lay the foundation. At the same time, these organizations look to\ncloud-based offerings from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and others to\ncreate intermediate data storage that can support diverse use cases as\nstrategies progress over time.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 3: Always put humans at the center of the strategy**\n\nA recent study from ZipRecruiter found that \u201cthe most successful applications\nof AI have been when used in partnership with humans, rather than as a\nreplacement.\u201d That\u2019s why, according to the study, AI has created three times\nas many jobs as it killed last year\u2014and companies are continuing to invest in\ntalent with data skills despite the advancement of automation technologies.\nThe World Economic Forum predicts that data-related jobs will be the most in\ndemand within the next four to five years, along with AI and ML specialists.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 4: Build a multidisciplinary team**\n\nA diverse team that incorporates AI experts, data scientists and line-of-\nbusiness analysts presents a more holistic approach to AI/ML, as the overall\nproject encompasses the data collection process all the way to the data mining\nactivities, machine learning and automation. Those who are able to engage with\nthe data gathering, processing and training will be able to optimize their\ncontribution to their organizations, and seriously enhance their individual or\ncorporate ability to achieve goals.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 5: Bridge the skills gaps**\n\nThere is increased demand for any data worker, regardless of technical acumen,\nto do more with data, and organizations need to look for ways to up-level\nskillsets, build models in understandable and transparent ways and generally\nbridge the skills gaps across the organization. Since AI data design requires\n\u201cdata speak\u201d to help build workflows, organizations must implement\ntechnologies such as augmented analytics that automate data prep, insight\ndiscovery and data science (i.e. autoML) all while communicating actions to\nroles with less AI know-how.\n\n#### **Data Point No. 6: Looking ahead**\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning undoubtedly will shake up the\nbusiness world and life as we know it in years to come, and organizations need\nto empower each and every human member of their business to be thinking about\nhow to leverage the technology. No matter how AI and ML evolves, data will\nalways be at the forefront, and one of the most important drivers of success\nand true digital disruption. A smart approach to data now will guide the way\nfor a successful AI-driven future.\n\n_If you have a suggestion for an eWEEK Data Points article, email_[\n_cpreimesberger@eweek.com_](mailto:cpreimesberger@eweek.com) _._\n\n  * [ Previous Story ](/big-data-and-analytics/prophix-launches-ai-powered-virtual-financial-analyst)\n  * Previous [ Prophix Launches AI-Powered Virtual Financial Analyst ](/big-data-and-analytics/prophix-launches-ai-powered-virtual-financial-analyst)\n  *   * Next [ Dell OEM, ENTOUCH: Increasing Intelligence of Smart... ](/big-data-and-analytics/dell-oem-entouch-increasing-intelligence-of-smart-buildings)\n  * [ Next Story ](/big-data-and-analytics/dell-oem-entouch-increasing-intelligence-of-smart-buildings)\n\n![Chris\nPreimesberger](/imagesvr_ez/b2bezp/2017/05/48767_13_Chris%20Preimesberger_standard_2.jpg?alias=author_bio)\n\n### Chris J.

To maintain its dominance in the country, Chime should look into boosting its product suite by offering services such as insurance options and joint accounts -- a trend we've already seen in Europe, where the neobank ecosystem remains ahead of the US'.\n  * US-based full-stack insurtechs Lemonade, Next Insurance, and Root were key winners in 2019, attracting a wealth of funding due to their business models.

They packed themselves into a cheerful courtyard outside the main\ncampus caf\u00e9, a parklike area dotted with picnic tables and a shade structure\nthat resembles a giant game of pickup sticks. Many of them held up handmade\nsigns: \u201cProud Iranian-American Googler,\u201d \u201cEven Introverts Are Here,\u201d and of\ncourse, \u201cDon't Be Evil!\u201d written in the same kindergarten colors as the Google\nlogo.\n\nAfter a few rounds of call-and-response chanting and testimonials from\nindividual staffers, someone adjusted the rally's microphone for the next\nspeaker's tall, lanky frame. [Sundar Pichai](https://www.wired.com/tag/sundar-\npichai/), Google's soft-spoken CEO of 15 months, stood in the small clearing\nin the dense crowd that served as a makeshift stage. \u201cOver the last 24 to 48\nhours, we've all been working very hard,\u201d he said, \u201cand every step of the way\nI've felt the support of 60,000 people behind me.\u201d\n\nIt was, to be precise, January 30; Donald Trump's presidency was 10 days old.\nAnd Executive Order 13769\u2014[a federal travel\nban](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/trumps-refugee-ban-direct-assault-civil-\nliberties/) on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and\nYemen, and a wholesale suspension of US refugee admissions\u2014had been in effect\nfor 73 hours, trapping hundreds of travelers in limbo at the nation's\nairports. For the moment, the company's trademark admonition against evil was\nbeing directed at a clear, unmistakably external target: the White House.\n\nSeptember 2019. [Subscribe to\nWIRED](https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/splits/wired/WIR_Edit_Hardcoded?source=Cover_Inset_CMlink).\n\n__Alex Anderson\n\nTo all the world it looked as if Google\u2014one of the most powerful, pro-\nimmigrant, and ostensibly progressive corporations in the United States\u2014was\ntaking a unified stand. But that appearance of unanimity masked a welter of\nexecutive-level indecision and anxiety. It probably would have been more apt\nif Pichai had said that, over the previous 48 hours, he had been backed into a\ncorner by thousands of his employees.\n\nIn those first days of the Trump era, Google's leaders were desperate to avoid\nconfrontation with the new regime. The company's history of close ties to the\nObama administration left executives feeling especially vulnerable to the\nreactionary movement\u2014incubated partly on Google's own video platform,\n[YouTube](https://www.wired.com/tag/youtube/)\u2014that had memed, rallied, and\nvoted Trump into office. (It didn't help that Eric Schmidt, then executive\nchairman of Google's parent company,\n[Alphabet](https://www.wired.com/tag/alphabet/), had been an adviser to\nHillary Clinton's campaign, or that some 90 percent of political donations by\nGoogle employees had gone to Democrats in 2016.) Kent Walker, Google's risk-\naverse vice president of public policy, had been advising staffers not to do\nanything that might upset Steve Bannon or Breitbart. So when the travel ban\nwas announced on the afternoon of Friday, January 27, Google executives\ninitially hoped to \u201cjust keep [their] heads down and allow it to blow over,\u201d\naccording to an employee who was close to those early calculations.\n\nBut the tribal dictates of Google's own workforce made lying low pretty much\nimpossible. [Larry Page](https://www.wired.com/tag/larry-page/) and [Sergey\nBrin](https://www.wired.com/tag/sergey-brin/), the former Montessori kids who\nfounded Google as Stanford grad students in the late '90s, had designed their\ncompany's famously open culture to facilitate free thinking. Employees were\n\u201cobligated to dissent\u201d if they saw something they disagreed with, and they\nwere encouraged to \u201cbring their whole selves\u201d to work rather than check their\npolitics and personal lives at the door. And the wild thing about Google was\nthat so many employees complied. They weighed in on thousands of online\nmailing lists, including IndustryInfo, a mega forum with more than 30,000\nmembers; Coffee Beans, a forum for discussing diversity; and Poly-Discuss, a\nlist for [polyamorous](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/silicon-valley-\npolyamory/) Googlers. They posted incessantly on an employee-only version of\nGoogle+ and on Memegen, an internal tool for creating and upvoting memes. On\nThursdays, Google would host a company-wide meeting called TGIF, known for its\nno-holds-barred Q&As where employees could, and did, aggressively challenge\nexecutives.\n\nAll that oversharing and debate was made possible by another element of\nGoogle's social contract. Like other corporations, Google enforces strict\npolicies requiring employees to keep company business confidential. But for\nGoogle employees, nondisclosure wasn't just a rule, it was a sacred\nbargain\u2014one that earned them candor from leadership and a safe space to speak\nfreely about their kinks, grievances, and disagreements on internal forums.\n\nFinally, to a remarkable extent, Google's workers really do take \u201cDon't Be\nEvil\u201d to heart. C-suite meetings have been known to grind to a halt if someone\nasks, \u201cWait, is this evil?\u201d To many employees, it's axiomatic: Facebook is\ncraven, Amazon is aggro, Apple is secretive, and Microsoft is staid, but\nGoogle genuinely wants to do good.\n\nAll of those precepts sent Google's workforce into full tilt after the travel\nban was announced. Memegen went flush with images bearing captions like \u201cWe\nstand with you\u201d and \u201cWe are you.\u201d Jewglers and HOLA, affinity groups for\nJewish and Latinx employees, quickly pledged their support for Google's Muslim\ngroup. According to _The Wall Street Journal,_ members of one mailing list\nbrainstormed whether there might be ways to [\u201cleverage\u201d Google's search\nresults](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-workers-discussed-tweaking-\nsearch-function-to-counter-travel-ban-1537488472) to surface ways of helping\nimmigrants; some proposed that the company should intervene in searches for\nterms like \u201cIslam,\u201d \u201cMuslim,\u201d or \u201cIran\u201d that were showing \u201cIslamophobic,\nalgorithmically biased results.\u201d (Google says none of those ideas were taken\nup.) At around 2 pm that Saturday, an employee on a mailing list for Iranian\nGooglers floated the possibility of staging a walkout in Mountain View. \u201cI\nwanted to check first whether anyone thinks this is a bad idea,\u201d the employee\nwrote. Within 48 hours, a time had been locked down and an internal website\nset up.\n\nEmployees also spent the weekend protesting as private citizens, out in the\nopen. At San Francisco International Airport, a handful of Google lawyers\nshowed up to offer emergency representation to immigrants; many more staffers\njoined a demonstration outside the international terminal. But one Googler in\nparticular made national newscasts. On Saturday night, without informing\nanyone at Google, Sergey Brin showed up at the airport to join the crowds. He\noffered no other comment to the press except to tell _Forbes_ , \u201cI'm here\nbecause I'm a refugee,\u201d and to make clear that he was there in a personal\ncapacity.\n\n#### Cast of Characters\n\nBy Zak Jason\n\n####\n\n **SUNDAR PICHAI**  \nGoogle's CEO for the past four years.

Over the course of the weekend, the\ncompany matched $2 million in donations raised by employees for crisis funds\nfor immigrants' rights. And then on Monday, at the last minute, Pichai decided\nto speak at the employees' demonstration.\n\nIn his short, off-the-cuff remarks to the packed courtyard, Pichai called\nimmigration \u201ccore to the founding of this company.\u201d He tried to inject a dose\nof moderation, stressing how important it was \u201cto reach out and communicate to\npeople from across the country.\u201d But when he mentioned Brin's appearance at\nthe airport, his employees erupted in chants of \u201cSer-gey! Ser-gey! Ser-gey!\u201d\nBrin finally extricated himself from the crowd and shuffled up to the mic,\nwindbreaker in hand. He, too, echoed the protesters' concerns but tried to\nbring the heat down. \u201cWe need to be smart,\u201d he said, \u201cand that means bringing\nin folks who have some different viewpoints.\u201d As he spoke, a news chopper flew\noverhead.\n\nAnd that was pretty much the last time Google's executives and workers\npresented such a united front about anything.\n\nAs the Trump era wore on, Google continued to brace itself for all manner of\nexternal assaults, and not just from the right. The 2016 election and its\naftermath set off a backlash against [Silicon\nValley](https://www.wired.com/category/business/tech-culture/) that seemed to\ncome from all sides. Lawmakers and the media were waking up to the extractive\nnature of Big Tech's free services. And Google\u2014the company that had casually\nintroduced the internet to consumer\n[surveillance](https://www.wired.com/tag/surveillance/), orderer of the\nworld's information, owner of eight products with more than a billion users\neach\u2014knew that it would be an inevitable target.\n\nBut in many respects, Google's most vexing threats during that period came\nfrom inside the company itself. Over the next two and a half years, the\ncompany would find itself in the same position over and over again: a nearly\n$800 billion planetary force seemingly powerless against groups of\nemployees\u2014on the left and the right alike\u2014who could hold the company hostage\nto its own public image.\n\nIn a larger sense, Google found itself and its culture deeply maladapted to a\nnew set of political, social, and business imperatives. To invent products\nlike Gmail, Earth, and Translate, you need coddled geniuses free to let their\nminds run wild. But to lock down lucrative government contracts or expand into\ncoveted foreign markets, as Google increasingly needed to do, you need to be\nable to issue orders and give clients what they want.\n\nFor this article, WIRED spoke with 47 current and former Google employees.\nMost of them requested anonymity. Together, they described a period of growing\ndistrust and disillusionment inside Google that echoed the fury roaring\noutside the company's walls. And in all that time, Google could never quite\nanticipate the right incoming collision. After the travel ban walkout, for\nexample, the company's leaders expected the worst\u2014and that it would come from\nWashington. \u201cI knew we were snowballing toward something,\u201d a former executive\nsays. \u201cI thought it was going to be Trump calling us out in the press. I\ndidn't think it was gonna be some guy writing a memo.\u201d\n\nAbout a thousand Google employees protest outside the company's headquarters\non January 30, 2017, decrying President Donald Trump's temporary ban on all\nvisitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\n __Jason Henry/The New York Times/Redux\n\n### II.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Google's internal social networks are like a microcosm of\nthe internet itself. They have their [filter\nbubbles](https://www.wired.com/story/study-revives-debate-about-googles-\nfilter-bubbles/), their trolls, their edgelords. And contrary to popular\nperception, those networks are not all populated by liberals. Just as the\nreactionary right was rising on YouTube, it was also finding ways to amplify\nitself inside Google's rationalist culture of debate.\n\nFor some time, for instance, one of the moderators of the company's\nConservatives email list was a Chrome engineer named Kevin Cernekee. Over the\nyears, Google employees have described Cernekee fairly consistently: as a\nshrewd far-right provocateur who made his presence felt across Google's social\nnetwork, trolling both liberals and conservatives.\n\nIn August 2015, the giant IndustryInfo mailing list broke into a roiling\ndebate over why there were so few women in tech. The previous year, Google had\nbecome the first Silicon Valley giant to release data on the demographics of\nits workforce\u2014and revealed that 82 percent of its technical workers were male.\nTo many inside the IndustryInfo thread, the number constituted clear and\ngalling evidence that Google had to change. When the conversation devolved\ninto a brawl over the merits of diversity\u2014one that Cernekee joined\u2014a senior\nvice president at Google attempted to shut it down. Cernekee proceeded to\nbombard the executive's Google+ page with posts about his right to critique\nthe pro-diversity \u201cSocial Justice political agenda.\u201d \u201cCan we add a clear\nstatement of banned opinions to the employee handbook,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso that\neverybody knows what the ground rules are?\u201d In response, Google HR issued\nCernekee a written warning for \u201cdisrespectful, disruptive, disorderly, and\ninsubordinate\u201d comments.\n\nGoogle also took action against employees on the opposite side of the debate\nfor their conduct in the same thread; but disciplining Cernekee had more\nlasting consequences. In November 2015, Cernekee filed a charge with the\nNational Labor Relations Board claiming that Google's warning constituted\nretaliation for his political views. He also alleged that the reprimand\ninterfered with his right to engage in \u201cprotected concerted\nactivity\u201d\u2014essentially, his right to freely discuss workplace conditions\u2014as\ndefined under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nAs Cernekee entered into a years-long legal battle with Google, he stayed\nactive on internal channels. In 2016, when members of a white nationalist\ngroup called the Golden State Skinheads clashed with antifa counterprotesters\nin a Sacramento park, Cernekee spoke up for the former on Google's Free Speech\nmailing list. Though he said he was \u201cthe farthest thing possible from a Nazi,\u201d\nCernekee argued that the skinheads \u201cstood up for free speech and free\nassociation.\u201d And in January 2017, when the prominent white nationalist\nRichard Spencer was punched in the head by a masked protester after Trump's\ninauguration, Cernekee told his fellow list members that \u201cthe battle over free\nspeech is escalating.\u201d He asked them to donate to a WeSearchr campaign that\nwas raising a bounty for anyone who could track down the identity of the\nassailant. When mailing list members said that WeSearchr\u2014a far-right answer to\nGoFundMe founded by the agitators Charles C. Johnson and Pax Dickinson\u2014seemed\nshady, Cernekee wrote, \u201cIt is completely on the up-and-up. Please don't\nslander my friends. :-(.\u201d\n\nBut as conspicuous as Cernekee was inside Google, he was all but invisible on\nthe open internet. Consequently, it wasn't Cernekee who would become Google's\nmost famous heretic. That distinction would fall to a comparatively reticent\nGoogle Search engineer named James Damore.\n\nIn late June 2017, Damore attended a company event about promoting diversity\nat Google, hosted at the Mountain View headquarters. There, he claims, he\nheard organizers discuss providing extra job interviews and more welcoming\nenvironments for women and underrepresented minorities. (Google says it does\nnot provide additional interviews for people belonging to specific\ndemographics.) To Damore, this all sounded like a violation of Google's\nmeritocratic hiring process, a finely tuned system built to identify\nobjectively qualified engineers.\n\nSoon after, on the plane ride back from a work trip to China, Damore wrote a\n[10-page memo](https://www.wired.com/story/the-pernicious-science-of-james-\ndamores-google-memo/) arguing that biological differences could help explain\nwhy there were fewer female engineers at Google, and therefore the company's\nattempts to reach gender parity were misguided and discriminatory toward men.\nOn average, he wrote, women are more interested in people than things, more\nempathetic, more neurotic, and less assertive. To support these claims about\npersonality differences, Damore cited two studies, three Wikipedia pages, and\nan article from Quillette, a contrarian online magazine that often covers free\nspeech on campus and alleged links between genetics and IQ. In the memo,\nDamore wrote that hiring practices aimed to increase diversity \u201ccan\neffectively lower the bar\u201d at Google.\n\nAll through July, Damore tried to get Google's management to pay attention to\nhis concerns. He sent his memo to the diversity summit's organizers; he sent\nit to Google's human resources department; at the suggestion of a coworker, he\nposted it in Coffee Beans, the internal listserv for discussions about\ndiversity. He made the same points in person at one of Google's \u201cBias Busting\u201d\nworkshops, where employees role-play how to identify unconscious bias against\nminorities. (There, he later claimed, his coworkers laughed at him.)\n\n#### Related Stories\n\n  * [Fred Vogelstein\n\nThe New Antitrust Scrutiny Should Worry Silicon Valley\n\n](/story/new-antitrust-scrutiny-should-worry-silicon-valley/)\n\n  * [Nitasha Tiku\n\nDocuments Suggest Google Did Not Investigate Major Leaks\n\n](/story/documents-suggest-google-not-investigate-major-leaks/)\n\n  * [Nicholas Thompson\n\nInside the Two Years That Shook Facebook--and the World\n\n](/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/)\n\nDamore framed his memo as an appeal for intellectual diversity, identifying\nhis reasoning as a conservative political position silenced by Google's\n\u201cideological echo chamber.\u201d \u201cIt's a perspective that desperately needs to be\ntold at Google,\u201d Damore wrote.\n\nPlenty of Damore's colleagues, however, had heard this perspective before. Ad\nnauseam. \u201cPeople would write stuff like that every month,\u201d says one former\nGoogle executive. When the subject of diversifying Google's workforce comes up\nin big meetings and internal forums, one black female employee says, \u201cyou\npretty much need to wait about 10 seconds before someone jumps in and says\nwe're lowering the bar.\u201d (After one diversity town hall in April 2015, an\nemployee wrote in an internal Google+ post that Google was \u201clowering the\nhiring bar for minorities, or arranging events where white men feel\nexcluded.\u201d) What's more, the debate kept coming up in a repetitive loop\nbecause of the constant influx of young graduates who were engaging in these\ndiscussions for the first time. Google was hiring at a breakneck pace at the\ntime. Between 2015 and 2017, it added some 20,000 full-time employees, about\nthe same number as Facebook's entire workforce. (And even after all that\nhiring, Google's technical workforce was 80 percent male, 56 percent white,\nand 41 percent Asian.)\n\nDamore's memo might have faded into obscurity if a colleague hadn't suggested\nthat he share it with some more receptive audiences inside Google. On\nWednesday, August 2, Damore posted his memo to an internal mailing list called\nSkeptics. The next day he shared it with Liberty, an internal list for\nlibertarians\u2014one Damore hadn't known existed. By Friday, the tech blog\n[Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmkx/google-employee-\nalleges-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-in-viral-memo) was reporting\nthat an \u201canti-diversity manifesto\u201d had gone viral inside Google.\n\nPichai was on vacation when his deputies told him that Google had better deal\nwith the Damore situation quickly. Pichai agreed and asked to corral his full\nmanagement team for a meeting. By Saturday, a full copy of Damore's document\nhad leaked to [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-\nanti-diversity-screed-1797564320). While Googlers waited for an official\nresponse from the top, managers who wanted to signal their support for women\nloudly condemned the memo's ideas on internal Google+ posts.\n\nTo Liz Fong-Jones, a site reliability engineer at Google, the memo's arguments\nwere especially familiar. Google's engineers are not unionized, but inside\nGoogle, Fong-Jones essentially performed the function of a union rep,\ntranslating employee concerns to managers on everything from product decisions\nto inclusion practices. She had acquired this informal role around the time\nthe company released Google+ to the public in 2011; before launch, she warned\nexecutives against requiring people to use their real names on the platform,\narguing that anonymity was important for vulnerable groups. When public uproar\nplayed out much as Fong-Jones had predicted, she sat across from executives to\nnegotiate a new policy\u2014then explained the necessary compromises to irate\nemployees. After that, managers and employees started coming to her to mediate\ninternal tensions of all sorts.\n\nAs part of this internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had become attuned to the\nway discussions about diversity on internal forums were beset by men like\nCernekee, Damore, and other coworkers who were \u201cjust asking questions.\u201d To her\nmind, Google's management had allowed these dynamics to fester for too long,\nand now it was time for executives to take a stand. In an internal Google+\npost, she wrote that \u201cthe only way to deal with all the heads of the medusa is\nto no-platform all of them.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Google's internal networks received a shock to the system.\nA screenshot of Fong-Jones' \u201cMedusa\u201d comment appeared on Vox Popoli, a blog\nrun by the alt-right instigator Theodore Beale, along with her full name and\nprofile photo. The comments section quickly filled with racial and sexual\nslurs fixated personally on Fong-Jones, who is trans. \u201cThey should pitch all\nthose sexual freaks off of rooftops,\u201d one anonymous Vox Popoli commenter\nwrote.\n\nOn Monday morning, Google's top management finally met to discuss what to do\nabout Damore. The room, according to reporting by\n[Recode](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/10/16125452/google-sundar-pichai-fire-\njames-damore-diversity-memo), was split. Half the executives believed Damore\nshouldn't be fired. Then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and head of communications\nJessica Powell urged their colleagues to consider how they would have reacted\nif Damore had applied the same arguments to race, rather than gender. That\npersuaded them: The engineer had to go. In a note to employees, Pichai said he\nwas firing Damore for perpetuating gender stereotypes.\n\nIn his message, Pichai tried to assure the left without alienating the right.\n\u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less\nbiologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt the\nsame time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely\nexpress their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority\nviewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must\nfeel free to express dissent.\u201d Then he promised to fly back to the Bay Area\nfor a TGIF meeting on Thursday where the employees could discuss the matter.\n\n[Damore's termination](https://www.wired.com/story/ex-google-employee-claims-\nwrongful-firing-for-criticizing-james-damores-memo/) set off a predictable\nonslaught of negative coverage from the right. Tucker Carlson, Ann Coulter,\nand Ben Shapiro all bashed Google; _New York Times_ columnist David Brooks\ncalled for Pichai to resign. Damore gave his first interviews to YouTubers\nJordan Peterson and Stefan Molyneux, the latter of whom is a proponent of\n\u201crace realism.\u201d The alt-right took this as an endorsement and started churning\nout memes of Damore, his head on Martin Luther's body, nailing his memo to the\ndoor of a church.\n\n#### SIGN UP TODAY\n\n##### Get the [Backchannel\nnewsletter](https://www.wired.com/newsletter/?name=backchannel&sourceCode=CarveLeft1)\nfor the best features and investigations on WIRED.\n\nMore leaks from inside Google fed the frenzy. Screenshots of conversations\namong Google employees on internal social networks, some dating back to 2015,\nappeared on Breitbart. Meanwhile, on a pro-Trump subreddit, a collage appeared\nthat showed the full names, profile pictures, and Twitter bios of eight Google\nemployees, most of them queer, transgender, or people of color. Fong-Jones was\none of them. Each bio featured phrases that would make the employees instant\ntargets for online harassment: \u201cpolyamorous queer autistic trans lesbian,\u201d\n\u201cjust another gay communist site reliability engineer,\u201d or, in Fong-Jones'\ncase, \u201cTrans and queer as fuck.\u201d Two days after Damore was fired, Milo\nYiannopoulos, the former tech editor at Breitbart, shared the Reddit collage\nimage with 2 million Facebook followers. \u201cLook at who works for Google, it all\nmakes sense now,\u201d he wrote\u2014as if these eight employees had been the ones who\nmade the decision to ax Damore.\n\nFor the employees who were being targeted, the leaks were terrifying. How many\nof their coworkers were feeding material to the alt-right? How many more leaks\nwere coming? And what was their employer going to do to protect them?\n\nIn the past Google had fired an employee for leaking internal memes from\nMemegen. But when the targeted employees reported harassment, they say,\nGoogle's security team told them that the leaking of screenshots might fall\nunder the legal definition of \u201cprotected concerted activity\u201d\u2014the same labor\nright invoked by Cernekee.\n\nTo Fong-Jones, the security team's answer was both shocking and instructive;\nshe didn't realize a leaker could be protected. \u201cEveryone thought Google had\nan absolute right to stop you from talking about anything related to Google,\u201d\nshe says. Yet here Google's hands were apparently tied by labor law.\n\nExecutives felt that they were doing everything they could. They offered to\nput up employees who had been doxed in a hotel for the night. But to the\ntargeted employees, it felt as though Google was allowing fear of a far-right\nbacklash and the threat of further lawsuits to trump the safety concerns of\nloyal employees. (A spokesperson for Google declined to specify whether the\ncompany managed to uncover the identity of the leakers in this case but said\nit investigates all such incidents and enforces its policies without regard to\npolitics.)\n\nBy the day when Pichai was supposed to answer questions about Damore at TGIF,\nchaos surrounded Google. That afternoon, Damore returned to campus with a\nphotographer whom _The New York Times_ had recently dubbed \u201cthe Annie\nLeibovitz of the alt-right.\u201d \u201cLive in Mountain View,\u201d the engineer tweeted,\nteasing some impending spectacle to his 40,000 new Twitter fans. Punchy tech\nreporters, sensing an opening, solicited employees to send them a live readout\nfrom the town hall.\n\nForty-five minutes before the meeting was supposed to start, Pichai sent his\n78,000 employees an email. \u201cTL;DR Sorry for the late notice, but we are going\nto cancel today's Town Hall,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe had hoped to have a frank, open\ndiscussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward.\u201d But\nthe questions employees had submitted for discussion at the meeting, he wrote,\nhad been leaked to the press and were already appearing in [outlets like\nWIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ceo-must-answer-these-questions-\nabout-that-memo/). He also alluded, vaguely, to the employees who had been\ndoxed as part of his rationale for canceling the meeting. \u201cOn some websites\nGooglers are now being named personally,\u201d Pichai wrote.\n\nFong-Jones was at home in Brooklyn when she received Pichai's email. She had\nwanted the executives to explain why, given their reasons for firing Damore,\nthey had let his memo float around Google for more than a month. Now it felt\nas if Google was using the abuse she and other employees had experienced as an\nexcuse to not answer questions. \u201cThat 100 percent did not sit right with me,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cThat wasn't going to make me any safer. In fact, it was a triumph,\nalmost, for the people harassing me.\u201d\n\nIn her internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had always been happy to meet senior\nmanagers on their terms. She kept their secrets. She followed the rules. And\nshe instructed others to do the same. Executives talked to people they\ntrusted, and they didn't trust people who talked to outsiders. But now Fong-\nJones decided to take matters into her own hands. In October she invited a\nlabor group that normally organizes blue-collar workers to teach Googlers more\nabout protected concerted activity. Perhaps a knowledge of labor law would\ncome in handy.\n\n### III.\n\nIn the beginning, Google gave its employees freedom because doing so paid off.\nSome of the company's first multibillion-dollar wins came from granting\nengineers autonomy and stoking their ambitions. In 2002 five engineers coding\nthrough the weekend came up with the core insight behind AdWords, the source\nof much of the company's revenue. The engineers weren't on the ads team and\nhadn't been asked to work on the problem. But they saw a note Larry Page had\nleft in the office kitchen on a Friday afternoon saying \u201cTHESE ADS SUCK.\u201d By 5\nam Monday the engineers had sent out a link with a prototype of their proposed\nsolution.\n\nThat breakthrough set the stage for what seemed like a virtuous cycle. Because\nGoogle made its money by showing people ads, it had a vested interest in\ngrowing the internet itself, and in finding new ways to make it useful. Free,\nworld-changing products poured out: Search, Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Docs, Photos,\nTranslate. To the lucky beneficiaries\u2014the company's billions of users\u2014it was\nalmost as if Google were a public works department and not a capitalist\nenterprise at all. The best engineers on earth flocked to enlist, and the\ncompany offered them time to spend on their own larks. Google saw office\nperks, employee freedom, and lofty missions as a proven recipe for staying\nahead in a changing world.\n\nOver time, Google's leaders codified this radical culture and evangelized it\nto the outside world, as if Google had found a way to suspend the ordinary\nlaws of management and commerce. In their best-selling 2014 book, _[How Google\nWorks](https://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-\nSchmidt/dp/1455582328?tag=w050b-20),_ Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg, two of\nthe main architects of Google's culture, stressed the importance of open\ndebate in the care and feeding of innovative people. \u201cIn our experience, most\nsmart creatives have strong opinions and are itching to spout off; for them,\nthe cultural obligation to dissent gives them the freedom to do just that,\u201d\nthey wrote. They stressed the importance of rooting out \u201cknaves\u201d (liars,\ncheaters, loafers) but supporting and protecting \u201cdivas,\u201d difficult but\nbrilliant employees who can grate on other employees' nerves. \u201cYou need these\naberrant geniuses because they're the ones that drive, in most cases, the\nproduct excellence,\u201d Schmidt said in an interview with WIRED earlier this\nyear. \u201cThey are better than other technical people.\u201d\n\nOne of Google's paradigmatic divas was Andy Rubin, the cofounder of Android, a\nstartup that Google acquired in 2005 for an estimated $50 million. Rubin was\nknown for being territorial, demanding, and impressively inventive.\nJournalists rarely failed to mention his penchant for oddball devices,\nincluding a doorbell at his home with a robotic arm that rang a gong on the\ninterior, and a retinal scanner on the exterior. (\u201cThe system makes it easier\nto deal with former girlfriends,\u201d reported a 2007 _New York Times_ profile,\nparaphrasing Rubin. \u201cNo messy scenes retrieving keys\u2014it's just a simple\ndatabase update.\u201d)\n\nAs executives saw it, Rubin delivered handsomely for Google. More than anyone\nelse, he ensured the company's safe and profitable transition into the mobile\nera. As users moved from desktops to smartphones, Android's open source\noperating system acted as a Trojan horse for Google's consumer apps, most\nimportantly search. By 2013, Android had a billion users, and its success\nafforded Rubin unbelievable perks, including a $14 million loan with a 1\npercent interest rate to buy a beach house in Japan. Page was particularly\ngrateful. At one point he awarded Rubin a $150 million stock grant, before\nGoogle's compensation committee even approved the offer.\n\nGoogle didn't invent all the concepts that charged its culture. (\u201cObligation\nto dissent,\u201d for example, is borrowed from the management consulting firm\nMcKinsey.) But it tied them together into a coherent, aspirational narrative\nabout engineers as a free-thinking people uniquely capable of reconfiguring\nthe world from first principles. This culture helped recruiting, it helped\nretention, and it kept the public and regulators rapt with admiration. So what\nif Google was becoming inordinately powerful? The monopolies of the past\nengaged in price-gouging and became less inventive. Google's products stayed\nfree and continued to blow your mind.\n\n> Google's culture helped recruiting, it helped retention, and it kept the\n> public and regulators rapt with admiration.\n\nOccasionally, of course, a glitch would mar Google's image as a benign,\ngravity-defying force in world markets, but even those glitches would\nsometimes resolve in ways that reinforced the myth. In 2006, eager to tap into\na growing market, Google opened an office in Beijing and launched a [censored\nversion of its search engine](https://www.wired.com/story/google-might-be-\nready-to-play-by-chinas-censorship-rules/) in China. Employees saw this as a\nclear violation of Google's principles; they were supposed to make the world's\ninformation universally accessible, not suppress it. The project quickly went\nawry. Executives had hoped that Google's presence in China would make the\ncountry more open, not closed. Instead, it emboldened the government to demand\nmore concessions. Then, in December 2009, Google discovered a sophisticated\ncyberattack, originating inside China, designed to access the Gmail accounts\nof dissidents and human rights activists. Brin, who had been extremely\nreluctant to enter China all along, convinced Page that they should stop\ncomplying with China's censorship rules and tell the public about the attack.\n\nAt the time, Google was run as a triumvirate, with CEO Eric Schmidt playing\nthe role of resident grown-up. Schmidt argued that if Google stopped censoring\nsearch results, it would never get back into China. But Page and Brin were\nunmoved. In January 2010, employees at Google's office in Beijing learned from\na public blog post that the company was pulling back from China. In an\nemotional teleconference, they told executives they felt abandoned.\n\nThe reaction in Mountain View, however, was euphoric. At the TGIF meeting that\nweek, employees burst into thunderous applause and gave Brin a standing\novation. \u201cThe legacy of the China decision was a giant dose of goodwill from\nGooglers around the world,\u201d Schmidt wrote in _How Google Works_ ; it\nreaffirmed the company's principles \u201cgoverning how all tough decisions should\nbe made.\u201d\n\nWithin five years, however, the costs of that decision\u2014and the limits of\nGoogle's entire formula for success\u2014were starting to become uncomfortably\nclear. Google was still minting money, but ad revenue growth was slowing, and\nthe cost of hiring engineers and funding R&D was climbing fast. Investors\nwanted to know what was next, and Google didn't have a convincing answer. The\ncompany was making incredible strides in [artificial\nintelligence](https://www.wired.com/category/business/artificial-\nintelligence/), but its growth online was increasingly boxed in by social\nnetworking sites. For users hanging out inside Facebook or talking to Alexa,\nGoogle's apps were no longer a click away. And while the company's founders\ntinkered with [self-driving cars](https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-self-\ndriving-cars-california/) and [helium balloons that beamed the\ninternet](https://www.wired.com/story/how-loons-balloons-find-way-deliver-\ninternet/) down to earth, Amazon had built up a huge advantage in an area that\nshould have been Google's to lose: cloud computing.\n\n#### LEARN MORE\n\n##### The WIRED Guide to [Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-\nintelligence/?itm_campaign=GuideCarveLeft)\n\nPage and Brin had been focused on the cloud for more than a decade. They had\nbuilt a sublime constellation of data centers around the world to power\nGoogle's own products like Gmail, a service that, for vast swaths of users,\nhad normalized the idea of surrendering your data to a company's remote\nservers. But Google's MO was building products that a billion people would use\nby default\u2014not closing deals, managing contracts, and customizing\ninfrastructure for other companies.\n\nAmazon had no such compunctions. In 2006 it began marketing a simple but\nhighly effective cloud computing platform to other firms, ultimately offering\nclients like NASA and Netflix on-demand access to computing power, including\nstoring and processing data. By the time Google finally offered a comparable\nservice called Google Cloud Platform, in 2012, Amazon was already leagues\nahead. In April 2015, Bezos revealed that Amazon Web Services had brought in\n$4.6 billion in revenue the previous year and was on track to out-earn his\nretail business soon. Google's earnings call was the same day. The company\nreported that 90 percent of its revenue was still from online advertising.\n\nAround the same time, Google's decision to take the moral high road out of\nChina was seeming more and more like a self-isolating move. Across Silicon\nValley, tech giants in search of growth were going after China's then-680\nmillion internet users. Apple had been running an app store in China since\n2010. Microsoft's search engine, Bing, had served censored search results\nsince 2009. Even LinkedIn was there. Meanwhile, Google watched as Chinese\nhandset manufacturers like Xiaomi sold phones that ran on an unofficial\nversion of Android\u2014which meant no Google Search on the homescreen, no Google\napp store, and no good way to make money off of millions of devices.\n\nThe problem wasn't just that Google was losing a slice of revenue here or\nthere. For Google, these weaknesses in cloud computing and China triggered an\nexistential dread: They meant the company was losing visibility into the way\nthe internet was evolving and what the future would look like.\n\nIn 2015, Google embarked on a massive reorganization. Under a new parent\ncompany, Alphabet, moon shots and side projects would fall outside of Google,\nwhich would be more focused on making money. With Pichai as Google's new CEO,\nfinding a new footing in China and cloud computing were among the company's\npriorities. One of Pichai's first moves, for instance, was to hire [Diane\nGreene](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/tech-exec-wants-cloud-googles-\nmoneymaker/), a cofounder of VMware, a company that helped popularize an early\nversion of cloud computing before the dotcom bust. Greene would head Google's\ncloud division. But catching up with Bezos was going to require Google to\nreorient. Buyers wanted dependability, not wizardry\u2014and they wanted someone in\nMountain View to pick up the phone. And to make up for lost time, Greene would\nneed to go after some big clients.\n\n __Alex Anderson\n\n### IV.\n\nOn August 11, 2017\u2014the day after pandemonium at the Googleplex had prompted\nPichai to cancel the town hall to discuss Damore\u2014Google's executives\nentertained an unlikely visitor: [secretary of defense James\nMattis](https://www.wired.com/story/james-mattis-artificial-intelligence-\ndiux/). At headquarters, they met the retired general across a stately\nconference table, with Brin, Pichai, Greene, and Walker on one side and\nMattis' crew on the other, all situated in the latest-model Aeron chairs in a\nnew shade called \u201cMineral.\u201d\n\nMattis was there to talk business. The Pentagon was in the process of\nrekindling its relationship with Silicon Valley, which had grown up out of\nmilitary contract work in the 1950s and '60s. The rise of artificial\nintelligence made a potential relationship once again seem mutually\nbeneficial. In recent years, partly at the urging of tech executives like\nSchmidt, the Pentagon had begun pursuing contracts to modernize its digital\ninfrastructure. But before the Pentagon could fully partake in AI and machine\nlearning, the department had to label its stockpiles of data and move it to\nthe cloud.\n\nAt the time of Mattis' visit, Google was reportedly in the process of bidding\nfor a project that would jump-start this transition. It was called the\nAlgorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, otherwise known as [Project\nMaven](https://www.wired.com/story/google-sets-limits-on-its-use-of-ai-but-\nallows-defense-work/). The project would involve labeling past drone footage\nto train a computer vision algorithm so that, once everything was in the\ncloud, new drone footage could be analyzed automatically. Though it was a\nrelatively small contract, Maven represented an important potential prize for\nGoogle. Greene had recently boasted that Google Cloud, which according to\nanalysts had 5 percent market share at the time, could be bigger than Amazon\nby 2022. Federal contracts offered a quick way to get there. Maven could put\nGoogle on the fast track to receive the security clearances it needed to win\nmore lucrative defense and intelligence agency contracts, like Joint\nEnterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), a massive Pentagon cloud contract\nthat was worth some $10 billion\u2014if any cunning competitor could wrestle it\naway from Bezos.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, and IBM were all in the running for the Maven contract. But\nGoogle was an especially furtive competitor. The company quietly put in a bid\nvia a contractor, and it prohibited the Pentagon from mentioning Google\nwithout prior approval. As Google seemed to close in on winning the contract,\nexecutives from the cloud team pondered how a deal with the\nPentagon\u2014especially one that could be linked to autonomous weapons\u2014might\nreflect on Google's non-evil brand. In September, a few weeks after the\nmeeting with Mattis, they discussed spinning up some positive PR that would\nfocus on the \u201cvanilla cloud technology\u201d aspects of the Maven contract. \u201cAvoid\nat ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,\u201d wrote Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford\nprofessor and Google Cloud's chief scientist for AI. Li had not been involved\nin the Maven contract, but she was concerned about the hype and confusion\nbuilding around AI in the public imagination. \u201cWeaponized AI is probably one\nof the most sensitized topics of AI\u2014if not THE most. This is red meat to the\nmedia to find all ways to damage Google.\u201d\n\nLi was right to be concerned about how Maven might be received, but the media\nwas not the only group she had to worry about. When Google won the Maven\ncontract in late September, the company opted not to say anything at all\u2014even\nto its own employees. But it wasn't long before Liz Fong-Jones learned about\nMaven from a group of concerned engineers who had been tapped to lay some of\nthe groundwork for it. They asked her to keep quiet until January while they\ntried to convince management to change course. Fong-Jones agreed and focused\nher attention on another fire that was quietly burning inside Google.\n\nJames Damore appears alongside attorney Harmeet Dhillon during a press\nconference on January 8, 2018, in San Francisco, announcing a lawsuit against\nGoogle.\n\n __Karl Mondon/Getty Images\n\n### V.\n\nJust before 8 am on Monday, January 8, 2018, Praetorian PR, a San Francisco\nfirm founded by a Republican political consultant, sent an email inviting\nreporters to a \u201cmajor press conference\u201d with James Damore and his lawyer,\nHarmeet Dhillon, who serves as the California Republican Party's national\ncommittee member and who \u201coften takes on controversial, high-profile cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won't want to miss it,\u201d the email promised.\n\nDamore sat next to Dhillon as she told a smattering of tech reporters and\nlocal news affiliates that her client had filed a class-action lawsuit against\nGoogle, alleging discrimination against white people, Asians, men, and\nconservatives, or any combination thereof. \u201cWe don't normally file 100-page,\n200-page complaints,\u201d Dhillon explained, thumbing through a heavy printout of\nthe complaint laid out in front of her. \u201cI didn't think people were going to\nbelieve the outlandish nonsense, so we actually attached screenshots\nthroughout.\u201d\n\nWhen Damore had filed a set of documents stating an intent to sue Google in\nDecember 2017, the documents named Kevin Cernekee as a fellow plaintiff, but\nthat complaint never materialized. In the lawsuit unveiled by Dhillon that\nday, Cernekee's name made no appearance. The complaint quoted from Google's\nwarning letter to him and included details about his interactions with\nexecutives and HR as evidence that Google had discriminated against\nconservatives, but Cernekee's identity remained mostly invisible to the\noutside world. At least 169 other Google employees were not so lucky: The\nscreenshots included in the lawsuit revealed dozens of email addresses,\nprofile pictures, and snippets of discussion. Most had been culled from\nGoogle's internal social networks, including an anonymous message board about\nmental health and a mailing list for gender-nonbinary employees.\n\nAnother round of harassment quickly began. Threats poured in, calling for\nemployees critical of Damore to be shot in the head, poisoned, blown up,\nstalked, doxed, sodomized with a cattle prod, and thrown off a building. As\nbefore, many of the employees who got singled out were queer and trans people\nof color. On forums like 4chan, employee names exposed in the lawsuit were\nlinked to their social media accounts. The personal information of at least\nthree employees was dug up and posted online. Another employee was the subject\nof a derogatory thread on an online forum called Kiwi Farms, which _New York_\nmagazine has called the web's biggest stalker community.\n\nThat month, Fong-Jones made another calculated exception to her usual policy\nof keeping dissent within the Google family. She and 14 other current\nemployees spoke to WIRED about the [\u201cdirty war\u201d that was being waged inside\nGoogle](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-\ngoogle/) over the issue of diversity. Most news coverage of Damore's case\namplified its claims that Google was cracking down on conservatives. But the\nemployees argued that something else was going on. HR had become \u201cweaponized,\u201d\nthey said; Googlers on both sides of the battle lines had become adept at\nworking the refs\u2014baiting colleagues into saying things that might violate the\ncompany's code of conduct, then going to human resources to report them. But\nGooglers on the right were going further, broadcasting snippets of the\ncompany's uncensored brawls to the world, and setting up their colleagues for\nharassment.\n\nGoogle's HR department, for its part, was feeling inundated with policy\nviolations across the spectrum. And according to Fong-Jones and her\ncolleagues, the department was too focused on trying to appear even-handed.\nEmployees had been reprimanded and even fired for criticizing Damore's memo\nusing terms like \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and \u201cwhite boy.\u201d \u201cPromoting harmful\nstereotypes based on race or gender is prohibited,\u201d Google said in a statement\nabout one such termination.\n\nSoon after speaking to WIRED, Fong-Jones helped prepare a statement explaining\nto colleagues about why she and the others had gone to the press. She asked\ncoworkers to sign a petition for a safer workplace, demanding better\nmoderation of mailing lists and rules against doxing coworkers. It received\n2,600 signatures. But it wasn't the only employee petition that would make\nwaves that winter.\n\n### VI.\n\nBy February, word about Maven began to swirl outside the teams of engineers\nwho had first alerted Fong-Jones to the project. So she decided to post about\nMaven on her internal Google+ page, sharing grave concerns that Google might\nbe helping the US government carry out drone strikes, according to a copy of\nthe post provided to WIRED by another Google engineer. Shortly afterward, the\ngroup of engineers posted an internal statement of their own, explaining that\nthey had been told to build an \u201cair gap\u201d\u2014a security measure favored by the\nPentagon that physically separates networks to protect sensitive data\u2014and\ninforming coworkers about their efforts to thwart the project.\n\nFong-Jones hoped to pressure Google's leaders using entirely internal\nchannels, and at first things seemed to be working. Outraged employees began\nreferring to the engineers as the Group of Nine, and executives felt compelled\nto respond. On her own Google+ page, Greene tried to assure employees that the\ncontract was only $9 million and merely a \u201cproof of concept.\u201d Within 48 hours,\nhowever, Fong-Jones says she received a call from a journalist\u2014Lee Fang of the\nIntercept\u2014asking her for comment on her Google+ post. Someone had leaked. If\nword got out, she feared, management would feel backed into a corner. So Fong-\nJones contacted Google's security team herself. Let's catch the leaker, she\nsaid.\n\nAnother staffer who was keeping close track of the internal rumblings about\nMaven was Meredith Whittaker, a program manager inside Google Cloud. In\naddition to her work at Google, Whittaker also helped run a New York\nUniversity-affiliated research center called the AI Now Institute, which\nstudies the ethics and social implications of artificial intelligence. On\nFebruary 28, Whittaker drafted a petition for employees demanding that Pichai\ncancel the contract. \u201cGoogle should not be in the business of war,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAt TGIF that week, executives were ill-prepared for the blowback. One employee\nstood up and said she had left her last job because of ethical concerns around\ndefense work. Brin told her that Google was different, because at least here\nshe could ask questions. Whittaker's petition netted about 500 signatures that\nnight and 1,000 the next day. It became a touchstone for a divisive, months-\nlong internal debate, inflamed by Google's open culture.\n\nThere was no consensus on Maven inside Google's fractious workforce, which\nincludes former Defense Department researchers, military veterans, and\nimmigrants from countries under US drone surveillance. Even the employee group\nfor veterans was split on the project. But Maven's opponents were organized in\na way that Google hadn't really seen before. Employees fanned out into\ndifferent groups. Some scoured Google's open databases, where they discovered\nemails that appeared to contradict Greene's statement about the size of the\nPentagon contract; they also found snippets of Python code for computer-vision\ntechnology that seemed designed to track human beings and vehicles. Some\nchurned out anti-Maven memes; others kept track of employees who were quitting\nover the contract. One activist group focused on fact-checking, listing every\ntime they found evidence to contradict the company line. The list got longer\nand longer.\n\nGreene responded by playing whack-a-mole\u2014locking down mailing lists, deleting\ndocuments, or asking employees to redact Google+ posts. Longtime execs were\ntaken aback, and even hurt, by the loss of their employees' trust, which they\nhad come to take for granted.\n\n> Fong-Jones contacted security herself. Let's catch the leaker, she said.\n\nIn March, [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-\nai-for-drones-1823464533) broke the Maven story to the public. Inside Google,\nexecutives urged employees to reserve judgment; Google's leaders, they said,\nwere developing a set of AI principles that would govern its business\npractices and contracts like Maven. Employees should wait for those\nprinciples, which would provide the whole company with a basis for discussion.\n\nAt another time, such a gesture toward self-regulation might have sufficed.\nAnd plenty of employees were eager to change the subject. But the anti-Maven\norganizers had momentum on their side\u2014and support from an outside labor\norganization called Tech Workers Coalition. They were also galvanized by a\npowerful realization: They could reliably summon the rapt attention of the\nmedia and the public, which were hungrier than ever for the vicarious thrill\nof watching someone\u2014finally\u2014hold tech companies accountable.\n\nOn April 4, _[The New York\nTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-\npentagon-project.html)_ published a story about Whittaker's petition, which by\nthen had gathered more than 3,100 signatures. Four days later, at 10 pm on a\nMonday night, Whittaker received an email from Greene inviting her to\nparticipate in a four-person internal debate about Maven, to be broadcast to\nGoogle's employees from Mountain View that Wednesday.\n\nWhittaker prepared feverishly. She called up colleagues and a friend from the\nDefense Department. She memorized drone kill stats and read up on defense\ncontracting. On the day she flew out from New York for the event, Whittaker\nlearned that the debate would take place three times during the course of the\nday, so that employees in other time zones could tune in.\n\nWhittaker should have been outmatched. Greene served as the moderator, and the\ntwo pro-Maven panelists were both longtime Google veterans. But they used many\nof the same arguments that executives had recited in recent TGIFs. _The\ncontract is exploratory. Maven merely uses Google 's open source machine-\nlearning software. Better to have Google working on AI than a defense\ncontractor. Maven helps \u201cour\u201d military._ Whittaker, building on an analysis\nshe had been rehearsing in Google's social networks for weeks, argued that the\nethical codes surrounding AI were still largely unformed and shouldn't be\ndefined on the fly in the context of a business relationship with the\nPentagon.\n\nAfter the first panel, Whittaker paced back and forth in the Googleplex\nparking lot, calling up colleagues to ask how they would have countered her\nremarks. By the time the last panel ended, Whittaker's energy was zapped. She\nran to her car in the pouring rain, picked up some beer and peanuts at a\nbodega, and went back to her hotel room. Inside Google, people often look to\nMemegen to gauge the mood of an unruly workforce. On the day of the town\nhalls, most of the memes were pro-Whittaker.\n\nOn May 30, _The New York Times_ published [a story about\nMaven](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-\npentagon.html) that included the emails Fei-Fei Li had sent to other\nexecutives about weaponized AI. At the weekly cloud team meeting two days\nlater, according to details leaked to Gizmodo, Greene announced that Google\nplanned not to renew the Maven contract. The backlash, she reportedly said,\nhad been terrible for the company.\n\n __Alex Anderson\n\n### VII.\n\nIn early June 2018, Pichai finally published the AI principles that Google had\npromised its employees. They included a list of four applications of AI that\nGoogle would not pursue, including weapons, technologies that gather and use\ninformation \u201cfor surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,\u201d and\ntechnology \u201cwhose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of\ninternational law and human rights.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, it seemed to many employees that Pichai had already broken\nthose principles. On August 1, a [blockbuster\nstory](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-\ncensorship/) in the Intercept reported that Google was planning to launch a\nnew censored search engine in China. Codenamed Project Dragonfly, the engine\nwould blacklist search terms like \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201cstudent protest,\u201d and\nwould produce government-controlled results for \u201cair quality.\u201d The service\nwould take the form of an app that Google was prepared to launch in six to\nnine months. Chinese officials had already seen a demo, according to the\nIntercept, though Google still needed government approval. The app might even\nhelp link a person's search records to their cell phone, with the information\nstored on servers in China. (A Google spokesperson tells WIRED that, at the\ntime, it was \u201cimpossible to confirm or comment on\u201d what the service \u201cmight\nhave looked like\u2014it was too early to say.\u201d)\n\nOnce again, an employee backlash set in. The Chinese government censorship\nthat had so disturbed Google staffers in 2010 had only grown bolder and more\nsophisticated under President Xi Jinping, who was detaining hundreds of\nthousands of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in internment\ncamps and deploying the latest in surveillance technology on citizens.\n\nThe succession of scandals kept deepening the divide between execs and\nemployee activists. More and more, the latter were questioning the social\ncontract they had lived by. \u201cI went from \u2018Oh my god, who leaked that?\u2019 to \u2018Oh\nmy god, management did what?!\u2019 \u201d Fong-Jones says. She started to doubt her\npast successes with executives. \u201cPerhaps the reason they were willing to\nlisten in the first place was to give up the things that mattered less to\nthem,\u201d she says.\n\nA couple of weeks after the first Intercept story, Pichai answered some\nquestions about Dragonfly, which he described as an \u201cexploratory\u201d program. In\nhis telling, Dragonfly was a project that aligned with Google's principles,\nnot one that contravened them. \u201cOur stated mission is to organize the world's\ninformation,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is one-fifth of the world's population.\u201d\nBesides, he said, \u201cI genuinely do believe we have a positive impact when we\nengage around the world, and I don't see any reason why that would be\ndifferent in China.\u201d\n\nBrin also spoke at the meeting, claiming he only learned about Dragonfly\nbecause of the \u201ckerfuffle.\u201d (Former executives say this strikes them as\nimplausible.) He also said that \u201cGooglers should feel broadly proud of their\nwork, not feel that it compromises their principles.\u201d Then the meeting stopped\nabruptly. Someone was live-leaking the event to a _New York Times_ reporter.\nAn executive onstage asked the technicians running the meeting to show\neveryone what was happening, and a wall of screens behind Brin flashed a tweet\nfrom the reporter who was posting Brin's comments in real time.\n\nWith the Dragonfly scandal, employees were in some ways the least of Google's\nworries. Washington lawmakers in both parties responded in ominous terms. \u201cIt\nwould be very dangerous for Google if they were misrepresenting to American\npolicymakers the extent of their involvement in China or the ramifications of\nsome of their joint ventures,\u201d US senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from\nVirginia, told WIRED, noting the growing bipartisan concern around China.\n\nDragonfly left Google particularly vulnerable to criticism from leaders on the\nright, who painted the company as un-American. Josh Hawley, now a Republican\nsenator from Missouri, said Google was motivated more by money than allegiance\nto any country. \u201cIf that means violating the privacy of American consumers,\nthey're happy to do it. If that means going to China and partnering on\ntechnologies that aid a repressive regime, they're apparently happy to do it.\u201d\nIn that context, Google's old slogan no longer applies, Hawley said. \u201cIt's\ntime that we remove the halo.\u201d\n\n### VIII.\n\nOn October 25, 2018, a story in _The New York Times_ dredged up the dark side\nof Google's tolerance for aberrant geniuses. In 2013, the paper reported, a\nwoman who worked for Google had accused Android cofounder Andy Rubin of\ncoercing her to perform oral sex in a hotel room. Google, the story reported,\nhad investigated and found the claim credible but [sent Rubin\noff](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-\nandy-rubin.html) with a $90 million exit package and a fond farewell.\n\nThe story didn't stop at Rubin. Another high-performing executive, Amit\nSinghal, the former head of Google Search, was given a multimillion-dollar\nexit package after a female employee accused him of groping her at an off-site\nwork event. A third, Richard DeVaul, allegedly told a female job candidate\nthat he was in a polyamorous relationship during her interview and invited her\nto meet him at Burning Man, where he asked if he could give her a massage.\nGoogle denied her the job. DeVaul was still working at Google as director of\nX, the company's experimental division for ambitious projects.\n\nThe _Times_ investigation also noted Google's overall \u201cpermissive culture,\u201d in\nwhich top executives\u2014including Brin, Schmidt, and chief legal officer David\nDrummond\u2014had relationships with female employees. Some of the women claimed\nthey were later pushed out of the company.\n\nGoogle employees lit up the company's internal social networks, once again\ncontemplating galling facts about the status of women in Silicon Valley. But\nthis time the discussion was less easily derailed, perhaps because some of the\nmost important exchanges took place on an anonymous mailing list called\nExpectant New Moms. The group's 4,000 members knew the stories about Rubin and\nSinghal\u2014thanks in part to email threads on the list after each executive\ndeparted. But Rubin's $90 million payout felt like a sucker punch. The fact\nthat leaders' misconduct had been an open secret made it worse. Why had they\ngiven so many years of their lives to make these men insanely rich?\n\nAt 2:05 pm, Claire Stapleton, then a product marketing manager at YouTube,\nfired off a message to the group: \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u2014all of it, all of\nthem. topple the patriarchy.\u201d\n\nThat day Alphabet was already poised to share some mixed financial news. The\ncompany was set to report $9.19 billion in profits for the third quarter,\nthanks in part to Trump's tax cuts to benefit big business, but missed revenue\ntargets. Now executives scrambled to do damage control with employees before\nthe earnings call. A couple of hours after the _Times_ story was published,\nPichai sent a memo assuring employees that Google had reformed its ways. In\nthe past two years, he wrote, 48 people had been terminated for sexual\nharassment, including 13 at the senior manager level or higher, none of whom\nreceived an exit package. Employees were skeptical. If Google was so committed\nto a safe environment, why was DeVaul still there? (A Google spokesperson said\nHR investigated the allegation \u201cthoroughly and took appropriate corrective\naction.\u201d)\n\nThat same evening, Page\u2014who was CEO when the claims about Rubin, Singhal, and\nDeVaul came to light\u2014apologized to employees at a TGIF. \u201cI've had to make a\nlot of decisions that affect people every day, some of them not easy. And, you\nknow, I think certainly there's ones with the benefit of hindsight I would\nhave made differently,\u201d he said in a prepared statement. Page's explanation\nwas evasive, but his tone was serious. Brin, on the other hand, made an\nawkward joke about confidentiality, which sounded to some as if he were\nblaming the leakers, and seemed irked by the fact that the same question came\nup over and over again when the executives had nothing new to say. The meeting\nsoon returned to business as usual with a product demo for new Google Photo\nfeatures.\n\nFor Stapleton, the meeting was a huge letdown. Her first job at Google, in\n2007, had been to help lead TGIF, including writing talking points for Page\nand Brin. Now they couldn't even answer the main question. At 7:58 pm,\nStapleton fired off another message to the list suggesting the moms channel\ntheir anger into collective action, like maybe a walkout, a strike, or an open\nletter. \u201cGoogler women (and allies) are REALLY ragefueled right now, and I\nwonder how we can harness that to force some, like, real change.\u201d\n\nAs the women dissected the TGIF performance, they also swapped stories about\nreporting harassment to Google HR, only to watch their abusers receive\npromotions. The messages were still rolling in at 1 am.\n\n#### Google Loses Its Way\n\n _In the past three years, the company has lurched from crisis to crisis._\n\u2014Z.J.\n\n### 2017\n\n **JANUARY 30**  \nGooglers protest President Trump's executive order banning citizens from seven\nmajority Muslim countries.\n\n####\n\n **AUGUST 2**  \nA memo questioning Google's pro-diversity hiring practices goes viral inside\nthe company and leaks to the press.

A group\nof eight organizers emerged, including Meredith Whittaker, and they got to\nwork planning logistics, hammering out demands, and fine-tuning their message.\nStapleton set up a Google form to ask employees why they were walking out. The\n350 responses that promptly poured in included personal stories about\nharassment, discrimination, retaliation, and pay inequity.\n\nFrom those responses and other internal posts, the organizers smelted together\nfive core demands. They wanted an end to forced arbitration, a process that\ncompelled employees to bring their claims to a private arbiter, paid for by\nGoogle, rather than before a judge. They also demanded pay equity and policies\nthat would guarantee more transparency around harassment claims. They scrubbed\npersonal details from the 350 stories and divided them into buckets that\nmapped to each demand, so the rally organizers would have something to read.\n\nAs the plans came together, Google invited Stapleton to join a meeting with\nthree top female executives: Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial\nofficer; Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube; and Eileen Naughton, the head of people\noperations. The invitation was brokered by the head of Women at Google, an\nemployee resource group, who told Stapleton it was an amazing opportunity.\nOther walkout organizers disagreed. Google was just trying to co-opt their\nmomentum, the organizers felt. Stapleton pushed off the request. \u201cIt feels\nweird to say no to these women who are, like, Illuminati,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, two days before the walkout, Pichai sent another memo:\n\u201cOne thing that's become clear to me is that our apology at TGIF didn't come\nthrough, and it wasn't enough.\u201d He acknowledged the protest and told employees\nthey would have the support they needed.\n\nThe plan was for each office to walk out at 11:10 am on November 1, 2018. By\nthe time the first images came in from Asia, it was clear that the call hadn't\nmerely mobilized the lefties in Mountain View. In Singapore, where labor law\nprohibits workers from marching, employees stood in a cavernous office lobby,\nsomber and listening intently to the speakers. In New York City, employees\nstreamed out from Google's Eighth Avenue office into a nearby park. Whittaker\nand Stapleton stood on chairs as they rallied the crowd. Their megaphone was\nno match for the noise from the West Side Highway, but chants of \u201cTime's up!\u201d\nrose above the din.\n\nWhen it came time for Mountain View to rally, [4,000 Google employees filled\nthe courtyard](https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-just-latest-sign-\ntech-worker-unrest/) outside the main caf\u00e9, once again chanting and holding\nsigns, including ones designed by volunteers from Google Creative Lab that\nsaid \u201cHAPPY TO QUIT FOR $90M\u2014NO SEXUAL HARASSMENT REQUIRED\u201d in a fresh, sans-\nserif font. Standing a few yards from where Pichai and Brin had stood during\nthe travel ban walkout in 2017, employees once again shared their stories. A\nfemale YouTube employee described being drugged by a coworker at a company\nevent, then being told by HR that she had to stay on the same team. This time,\nno executive stepped up to the mic. No one chanted their names.\n\nLocal TV crews had to report from the edges of campus, but the news choppers\noverhead had a clear view of \u201cNot OK, Google\u201d and \u201cTime's Up\u201d written in chalk\non the pavement. By then, Stapleton, Whittaker, and the other organizers back\nin New York had commandeered a booth at a Mexican place in the Meatpacking\nDistrict. They ordered margaritas and chips and guacamole, updating social\nmedia accounts and ducking outside for press interviews. The women were\ntriumphant; they were half asleep. A few days earlier, they'd thought a\nturnout in the hundreds would be a big deal. When they tallied the total,\n20,000 employees had walked out.\n\nIn a way, though, Google's attempts to neutralize the walkout had worked. A\nsense of catharsis and camaraderie seemed to overshadow any hostility toward\nmanagement. Even some supporters felt that the walkout was more about the act\nthan the asks. On November 8, 2018, a week after the protest, Pichai sent a\nmemo to his employees\u2014simultaneously published on Google's blog\u2014announcing\nthat Google would no longer require arbitration on sexual harassment claims.\nBut it would still prohibit class actions. The change brought Google in line\nwith policy tweaks that Microsoft, and even Uber, had made within the past\nyear.\n\nOn November 1, 2018, as many as 20,000 Google employees walked off the job to\nprotest the tech giant's handling of sexual misconduct by leaders.\n\n __Michael Short/Getty Images\n\n### IX.\n\nGoogle's response followed a familiar cycle: internal opposition and bad\npress, followed by incremental change. But the Women's Walkout appears to have\nperturbed executives in a way that the protests against Dragonfly and Maven\nhad not. In the months that followed, pushback seemed to spill over [into the\norganizers' day jobs](https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-\nsay-theyre-facing-retaliation/). In December, Whittaker was told she would\nhave to leave the Google Cloud organization, where she had worked for three\nyears. A few weeks after that, Stapleton claims she was told that her role at\nYouTube would be \u201crestructured\u201d and she would lose half her reports and\nresponsibilities. (A Google spokesperson says no changes were made to\nStapleton's role.)\n\nFong-Jones, for her part, was burning out. It had been a long year and a half\nsince Damore's memo leaked. In early January 2019, she submitted her\nresignation, but she turned even that into a last-ditch effort to reform\nGoogle; she told executives she would reconsider if the company put an\nemployee on its corporate board. Instead, Google HR tried to get her to leave\nbefore her notice period was up, and she filed a retaliation claim. Google\ninvestigated and determined it was unfounded.\n\nThat month, Google also tightened the reins on TGIF. Brin and Page stopped\nshowing up. Employees could access video recordings for only a week after the\nmeeting, rather than for years. The company nixed live questions, which Google\nclaimed was more fair to employees in different time zones. (\u201cWe're a global\ncompany and want to make sure we're answering questions from employees around\nthe world,\u201d a spokesperson says.) TGIF's transformation from candid\nconversation to press conference was pretty much complete.\n\nThe company's internal social networks were quieter too. Cernekee had been\nfired in June 2018 for violating multiple company policies, including using a\npersonal device to download company information. As part of his ongoing legal\ncase, according to people familiar with the matter, he had to give back 20,000\npages of internal documents, some of them confidential. Cernekee disputes\nthis.\n\n(For weeks, as WIRED was preparing this story for publication, Cernekee's\nlawyer tried to dissuade the magazine from disclosing his identity. Six days\nafter this article went to press\u2014but before it appeared on newsstands\u2014an\ninterview with Cernekee appeared in _The Wall Street Journal_. He presented\nhimself as a whistle-blower and mainstream Republican who had been bullied and\neventually fired for his beliefs. In subsequent interviews with Tucker Carlson\nand on _Fox & Friends_, Cernekee said he believed that Google would try to\nsway the 2020 election\u2014a claim that inspired a tweet name-dropping the\nengineer from President Trump himself.)\n\n[Damore's class-action lawsuit](https://www.wired.com/story/james-damores-\nlawsuit-is-designed-to-embarrass-google/), meanwhile, was still proceeding,\nalbeit without Damore. In October 2018 his claims were moved to arbitration,\nwhile claims from two conservatives who allege they were denied positions for\npolitical reasons are proceeding in court.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on\nDecember 11, 2018, in Washington, DC.\n\n __Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nA couple of months later, Pichai was called up to answer questions about\nDragonfly at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\nare no plans for us to launch a search product in China.\u201d That wouldn't be his\nlast trip to Washington. After two years of employee revolts, culture-warring,\nand accusations, the [furor that had surrounded\nFacebook](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-\nfresh-hell/) for the previous three years now finally seemed to be aimed at\nGoogle with full force. Within a three-week span in March, Senator Hawley\nbanged the drum on amending laws that granted platforms immunity from\nliability for moderating their platforms; Democratic senator and presidential\ncandidate [Elizabeth Warren published a plan to break up Big\nTech](https://www.wired.com/story/elizabeth-warren-break-up-amazon-facebook-\ngoogle/); and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that Google's\neffort to court China \u201cindirectly benefits the Chinese military,\u201d even as it\nsnubbed working with the Pentagon. A couple of days later, President Trump\ntweeted, \u201cGoogle is helping China and their military, but not the U.S.\nTerrible!\u201d\n\nThat spring, many of Google's efforts to stave off scrutiny seemed to hasten\nits arrival. In March, Google announced that it had formed an AI ethics\ncouncil composed of external advisers. It included [Kay Coles\nJames](https://www.wired.com/story/google-needs-grow-cloud-business-\ncarefully/), president of the Heritage Foundation, who lacked any discernible\nexpertise in artificial intelligence and who had recently expressed anti-trans\nand anti-immigrant views. Some employees were appalled; an internal petition\nto remove James quickly gained 2,500 signatures. Breitbart and the Daily\nCaller posted the names of petition organizers, including Whittaker, and\nleaked internal messages from a mailing list. One ethics council member quit\nin the midst of the uproar. When Google learned that another member was\nplanning on defecting, the company disbanded the council\u2014nine days after it\nlaunched. To the outside world, it looked as if Google had capitulated to\nemployee protests. Conservative critics descended. In _The Washington Post_ ,\nJames said Google was not upholding its bargain with the right. \u201cHow can\nGoogle now expect conservatives to defend it against anti-business policies\nfrom the left that might threaten its very existence?\u201d she asked.\n\nWhile Whittaker was helping to lead the charge against the ethics council, she\ncontinued to tussle with management over her job. Stapleton, who had been told\nmultiple times that she was a \u201crising leader\u201d in YouTube marketing, says she\nwas also struggling to hold on to the responsibilities she'd held before the\nwalkout. When the two women heard that a third organizer had also been denied\na transfer, they posted an open letter on the walkout mailing list on a Monday\nin late April, reporting to their coworkers that [Google was retaliating\nagainst them](https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-\ntheyre-facing-retaliation/). They invited their colleagues to fight back\nagainst retaliation at an employee town hall meeting that Friday, to be\nlivestreamed at Google offices around the globe.\n\n#### Got a Tip?\n\nIf you'd like to tip WIRED anonymously, we have a couple ways for you to [do\nthat here](https://www.wired.com/securedrop/).\n\nThat week, managers emailed the entire marketing and cloud departments,\ndenying the women's claims. On the morning of the town hall, Lorraine Twohill,\nthe head of marketing at Google, also sent a department-wide email saying\nStapleton's claims were false. \u201cOver the last several weeks, I have spent a\nlot of time talking to everyone involved, trying to understand and empathize\nwith the situation,\u201d she wrote. Stapleton says Twohill never asked her about\nthe incidents surrounding her claims of retaliation.\n\nAfter that, Stapleton saw no future for herself at YouTube. She handed in her\nresignation three weeks later. In mid-July, Whittaker resigned too. The next\nday Google happened to announce definitively that Project Dragonfly was dead.\nBy then, few of the major organizers of the protests that had shaken Google\nover the past two years were left at the company.\n\nBut that didn't mean things would go back to normal at Google. Over the past\nthree years, the structures that once allowed executives and internal\nactivists to hash out tensions had badly eroded. In their place was a new\nmachinery that the company's activists on the left had built up, one that\nskillfully leveraged media attention and drew on traditional organizing\ntactics. Dissent was no longer a family affair. And on the right, meanwhile,\nthe pipeline of leaks running through Google's walls was still going as strong\nas ever.\n\nLate this June, Project Veritas, a right-wing outlet specializing in stings\nand expos\u00e9s, published a slew of leaked documents and snippets of hidden-\ncamera footage from inside Google. One of the items it posted, as if evidence\nof Google's supposed bias, was a \u201cBeginner's Guide to Protesting\u201d that Google\nemployees had drawn up around the time of the travel ban walkout back in 2017.\nNext to the document was a message and a link. \u201cDo you work in Big Tech?\u201d it\nsaid. \u201cProject Veritas would love to hear from you.\u201d\n\n _Updated 8-13-19, 1:50 pm EDT: An earlier version of this piece incorrectly\nstated the name of the Golden State Skinheads, and that none of Google 's\nmajor protest organizers remained at the company by July 2019. A few\norganizers continue to work at the company._\n\n* * *\n\n **NITASHA TIKU** _([@nitashatiku](https://twitter.com/nitashatiku)) is a\nsenior writer at_ WIRED.\n\n _This article appears in the September issue.[Subscribe\nnow](https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/splits/wired/WIR_Edit_Hardcoded?source=ArticleEnd_CMlink)._\n\n _Let us know what you think about this article.

However, paying\nless, or nothing, doesn't necessarily mean that the software is of lower\nquality, as the open source community can testify.\n\nHowever, there can be issues with sharing documents between different office\nsuite platforms, which can be a real concern. One specific example is that a\ndocument saved to .doc or .docx format in a free software platform such as\nOpen Office might not retain its formatting when loaded into Microsoft Word\nitself, even though the file type shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThis is why when choosing an alternative to Microsoft Office, you need to be\ncertain of any shortfalls that might limit your use of the software,\nespecially if you need to share or collaborative on documents with other users\nwho have one or more different office suites.\n\nIf you're using the office alternative as a standalone piece of software there\nshouldn't be any such issues, but it is something to be mindful about if you\nend up changing to a different software suite.\n\nThat said, the best in the Microsoft Office alternatives are generally strong\nprograms with full functionality, and little problem sharing files with other\nplatforms. Here we'll show the best of them, along with their strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n![Divider](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n[\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-\nproducts?tab=2)\n\n[**The best office software in the world now is: Microsoft\n365**](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-\nproducts?tab=2) **  \n** There are many different office software suites out there, but Microsoft\nOffice remains the original and best, offering an unsurpassed range of\nfeatures and functionality that rivals just can't match.\n\nEven better, [Microsoft 365](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-\nmicrosoft-office-products?tab=2) \\- previously known as Office 365 - is a\ncloud-based solution which means you can use it on any computer, mobile\ndevice, or smartphone, without having to worry about compatibility.

FreeOffice](http://www.freeoffice.com/en/download)\n\nA free alternative which looks very similar to MS Office\n\nInterface very close to MS Office\n\nTouchscreen compatibility\n\nFor Windows, Mac, and Linux\n\nIf you are looking for a free and easy alternative to Microsoft Office, then\n[FreeOffice](http://www.freeoffice.com/en/download) is the suite for you. The\ncompany, SoftMaker, has been developing office software since 1987 and its\noffice suite is their flagship product.\n\nFreeOffice is a complete office suite that is free to use for both home and in\nthe workplace. It is developed for both Windows and Linux, and offers a basic\nversion for Android users.\n\nThe suite itself is fully compatible with all Microsoft Word, Excel and\nPowerPoint formats. This means that you can not only view but save files in\nformats such as DOCX, XLSX and PPTX. It also supports older file types such as\nPPT and XLS.\n\nThe new interface that was launched this year gives you the option of either\nworking with modern or classic menus and toolbars. This makes switching from\nMicrosoft Office easy to do as the interface is eerily similar.\n\nFor those users who have the luxury of a touchscreen PC you can use touch mode\nwith larger icons.

LibreOffice is\nthe default suite for most Linux distros and it is also available for use on\nWindows and macOS. There's also a LibreOffice viewer for Android.\n\nAs with most open source software all your technical support comes from\nonline, but seeing how easy this is to use, support will be rarely needed. The\nplatform also offers the option to export your files into PDF format amongst\nothers.\n\nYou can add extra features to LibreOffice via extensions from its website.\nThese include extra templates for documents.\n\nWhile still a smaller download size than Microsoft Office, LibreOffice weighs\nin at 228MB so is still a fairly large suite to install.\n\nOne of the criticisms that has been noted in relation to LibreOffice is that\nif you create a document within its word processor and then open it within a\nWord document, it may interfere with fonts and formatting.\n\n  * [You can download LibreOffice here](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)\n\n[\n\n![Best Microsoft Office alternatives: WPS\nOffice](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Kingsoft (Image credit: WPS\nOffice)](https://www.wps.com/download/)\n\n### [3\\. WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/download/)\n\nHas an excellent free tier and advanced features for subscribers\n\nGenerous free tier\n\nMulti-language support\n\nAndroid app too large\n\n[WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/download/) was released in 2016 by Chinese\nsoftware developer Kingsoft. It is an office suite that is available for\nWindows, Linux, Android and iOS. The suite is available in English, French,\nGerman, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish and Russian.\n\nIt offers a free and a premium tier. The free tier allows you to use Writer,\nPresentation and Spreadsheets, which are alternatives to the Microsoft Office\nsuite which it also resembles closely. WPS offers a PDF to Word converter\nwhich is fast and easy to use. It supports bulk exportation and can also\nsplit-merge PDF files if needed.\n\nThe suite offers 1GB of free cloud storage for iOS and PC users, but this\nservice is not yet available for Android.\n\nThe 'Premium' tier is $29.99 per year and allows the user to connect up 9\ndevices at once. It also gets rids of all those annoying adverts that are\ncommonplace on the free tier.\n\nWPS has been criticised for not allowing collaboration beyond those that track\nchanges and allow users to insert comments. Users have also said that the\ninterface can be quite slow at times when it comes to loading documents. Linux\nusers have mentioned that not all fonts are automatically included and that\nthey have to be installed separately.\n\nFor Android users installation is quite large and criticism has been levelled\nimploring the developer to make it more lightweight.\n\n  * [You can download WPS Office here](https://www.wps.com/download/)\n\n[\n\n![Best Microsoft Office alternatives:\niWork](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Apple (Image credit: Apple)](https://www.apple.com/iwork/)\n\n### [4\\. iWork](https://www.apple.com/iwork/)\n\nAn excellent, free and easy to use office suite\n\nBeautiful Interface\n\nSimple to use\n\nOnly available for Mac\n\n[iWork](https://www.apple.com/iwork/) is Apple's alternative to Microsoft\nOffice. It consists of Pages, Keynote and Numbers. These are broadly\nequivalent to Word, PowerPoint and Excel. It is exclusive to macOS for a local\ninstall, but there are versions on the cloud that can be enjoyed by users of\nother platforms.\n\niWork is much more lightweight than MS Office and this would suit most users.\nThere are a lot of features in MS Office that the majority of users do not\neven know exist nevermind actually use. That might be a pro for power users\nbut many users may just want a straightforward interface with only a few tabs\nto choose features from. This is where iWork comes in.\n\niWork is free and can be downloaded from the App Store on your Mac. There are\nthree separate apps, each for word processing, preparing presentations and for\ncreating spreadsheets. Numbers, Apple's spreadsheet alternative, offers a\nblank canvas for you to begin on rather than showing a daunting grid view on\nyour spreadsheet. It takes away that feeling of it being a ledger and it is\nvery easy to use and add images, tables and charts as you go.\n\nThe word processor, Pages, is very simple and is perfect for straightforward\ndocuments, and it is not inundated with the layers of options that exist\nwithin MS Word. Pages also allows users to collaborate on their work and has\nnow added a feature that supports EPUB, which can be created and shared to\niBooks if you see fit to do so.\n\nThe presentation app, Keynote, has been referred to as the better alternative\nto PowerPoint by online users as it is easy to use. It creates beautiful\npresentations without the hassle that can be associated with PowerPoint.\n\nMS Office may not be able to open documents created in iWork, but all iWork\napplications can export to other formats that are compatible with other\nsuites.\n\n  * [You can download iWork here](https://www.apple.com/iwork/)\n\n[\n\n![Best Microsoft Office alternatives:\nCalligra](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nImage Credit: KDE (Image credit: Calligra)](https://www.calligra.org/get-\ncalligra/)\n\n### [5\\.

It is completely distinct from LibreOffice.\n\nWhile LibreOffice has the familiar look and feel of MS Office, Calligra does\nnot. A lot of the useable features tabs are set on the right-hand side of the\nscreen and not on the top like MS Office and other office suites. This means\nthat the page you are currently editing does not take up the full screen.\n\nOne of the extra features that makes Calligra stand out is that it offers a\nmind-mapping and project managing tool. Usually these cost extra.\n\nCalligra allows you to read DOCX and DOX formats but you cannot edit them.\nThis can cause difficulties if your contacts send you Microsoft Office\ndocuments, so ask them to use a different format such as ODT (Open Document\nText) instead.\n\n  * [You can download Calligra here](https://www.calligra.org/get-calligra/)\n\n[\n\n![Best Microsoft Office alternatives:\nOfficeSuite](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nImage Credit: MobiSystems ](https://www.officesuitenow.com/en/plans/)\n\n### [6\\.

This tier costs $29.99. It has all the free tier has to offer along\nwith the ability to track changes, export PDF's to other editable formats and\nadvanced PDF features such as digital signatures and passwords. The 'Group'\ntier is $49.99 per year and allows you to use across five desktops, five\ntablets and 5 phones.

Below we'll\ncontinue this list with some more free office software applications for word\nprocessing, spreadsheets, and presentations.\n\n[ **G Suite**](https://gsuite.google.com/) aka Google Docs, Sheets and Slides\nis a free office software platform from Google. While the G Suite of office\nsoftware applications don't yet have the reputation for user features that\nMicrosoft Office enjoys, Google do throw in some nice additional ones. For\nexample, Google Docs in G Suite allows for group collaboration on documents, a\nfeature that normally comes with a premium price from Microsoft. Additionally,\nthe G Suite apps save everything to the cloud using G Drive, so your documents\ncan be easily synced between any device. Perhaps even better, as G Suite runs\nas a web application rather than downloaded software, it means it's accessible\nfor any device giving it a cross-platform advantage. There are professional\nand business upgrade options from the basic platform, available from $5 per\nmonth for the Professional edition, and for business users it is priced at\n$10.\n\n[ **Microsoft Teams**](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/free)\nis a free office suite from Microsoft, which offers basic versions of Word,\nExcel, Powerpoint, and OneNote from the Office 365 suite. Everything is run\nonline from Microsoft's cloud, Sky Drive, with up to 2GB of storage per user.\nSurprisingly, there are also collaborative options available, so don't think\nyou need the premium Office 365 suite for business use. Unsurprisingly,\nthough, Microsoft is keen to push on Office 365 as an upgrade, available at $5\nper user per month for the Business Essentials package, and $12.50 for the\nBusiness Premium package and features.\n\n[ **Zoho Office**](https://www.zoho.com/docs/office-suite.html) is another\noffice suite worth considering as an alternative to Microsoft Office. Although\nit gets less press, Zoho Office is a pretty competent software suite, and\nincludes word processing as Zoho Writer, spreadsheets as Zoho Sheets, and\npresentations through Zoho Show. All of the applications are run online\nthrough the cloud, and there are also collaborative options. Pricing is free\nfor individuals and small team of up to 25 people, though there are business\nStandard and Premium upgrades available starting from less than $5 per user\nper month.\n\n[See more Software news ](https://www.techradar.com/news/software)\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

But we thought it was right\nto build a presence in this market, because we want to offer our customers a\nfull range of financial products.\"\n\nThe [Bank of England ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/bank-of-england)enforced\nringfence regulations at the start of the year -- meaning that large banks\nseparated their domestic retail banks from their investment banking\noperations. This left high street banks such as [Barclays\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/barclays)and HSBC, with large customer\ndeposits that they put to use in the mortgage market, resulting in prices\nbeing driven down.\n\n### New mortgages\n\nDurham-based Atom saw pre-tax losses widen to \u00a380m in the financial year to\nthe end of March compared with \u00a353m a year ago, with the increase largely\ndriven by a \u00a319m mixture of investments in new technology and impairments to\nits existing platform.\n\nThe lender said total assets rose by 40 per cent to \u00a32.8bn over the period\nwith loans and advances doubling to \u00a32.4bn, while deposits lifted 23 per cent\nto \u00a31.8bn.\n\nMullen says mortgage prices are beginning to \"normalise now\", adding that Atom\nwill be more \"cautious\" this year. It is slowing its lending for homes, the\nlender's largest market, and focusing on higher loan-to-value deals to\nminimise losses.\n\nHe said the business will approve between 50 to 60 mortgages a week, this\ncompares with 2017 when, at times, it approved 300 new home purchases a week.\n\n### Bank models\n\nThe mortgage market is important to Atom, because the lender, founded in 2014,\nhas a very traditional model.\n\nIt focuses on building a classic savings and mortgage and small business\nlending model, which simply relies on receiving higher interest in loans than\nit pays out in savings rates. It writes business loans between \u00a3380,000 to \u00a31m\nin value.\n\nThis is unlike peers such as [Monzo ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/monzo)and\n[Revolut,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/revolut) which base revenues around\nsubscription services and in-app marketplaces.\n\nHowever, Atom's Mullen plans to extend the number of services the bank offers\nover the coming year.\n\n### New products\n\nIt will launch instant access savings for personal account holders, which the\nbank expects will be beta tested with small sample groups in October.\n\nThe lender also expects to launch Individual Savings Accounts and unsecured\npersonal loans in 2020, followed by a full current account at the end of next\nyear, or the start of 2021.\n\n\"We want to offer our customers a full suite of credible products,\" said\nMullen. \"We are a savings and loans business that allows customers to borrow\nmoney to buy houses and finance life. That is an important part of banking in\nthis country, or any other country.\"\n\nIn May, it was widely reported that Atom's largest shareholder Spanish lender\nBBVA, which owns a 39 per cent stake in the business, shelved plans to buy the\nUK bank due to ongoing Brexit uncertainty, leaving Atom to search for\nadditional backing ahead of a hoped-for initial public offering in 2022.\n\n### Options to buy\n\nBut Mullen says the banking giant has never had designs on the lender he runs.\n\n\"BBVA has never had an option to buy this bank,\" says Mullen. \"They are very\ncommitted and supportive.\"\n\nNevertheless, Atom did have to raise \u00a350m from investors in July, including\n\u00a310m from under-fire star fund manager Neil Woodford's Patient Capital Trust.\nThe star investment manager Woodford came under fire in June when his \u00a33.7bn\nEquity Income fund was closed following billions of pounds of withdrawals by\ninvestors, amid concerns over the proportion of unlisted stocks in the fund.\n\nHowever, the Atom boss welcomes Woodford's 18 per cent holding in the bank.\n\n\"Neil was one of our first institutional backers,\" says Mullen. \"Without him,\nthere would be no [Atom Bank.](http://www.altfi.com/companies/atom-bank) Also,\nthe amount with which he backed us in the last funding round, was more than\nthe previous round. So he remains committed to the bank.\"\n\nThe bank has raised around \u00a3450m since it was founded five years ago, valuing\nthe business at \u00a3530m. The lending boss expects to raise further capital from\ninvestors next year.\n\n### 'Cutting corners'\n\nThe boss of the lender does not expect Atom to turn a profit for 18 months to\ntwo years, but that is only on a run-rate basis, of extrapolated earnings\nacross a financial year.\n\n\"We are not in a great hurry,\" says Mullen. \"Making money in a hurry in\nbanking means you are either taking risks or cutting corners.\"\n\nAtom is celebrating a \u00a310m win earlier this month from the Banking Competition\nRemedies (BCR) fund, set up as a European union condition of the[ Royal Bank\nof Scotland's](http://www.altfi.com/companies/rbs) 2008 government bailout.  \n\nThe cash is awarded in a bid to boost funds available to small businesses.\nAtom has pledged to deliver an extra \u00a33bn of funding to small firms by March\n2024, by setting up new unsecured, asset-backed and invoice lending\nfacilities. The bank said it will spend \u00a315m of its own cash and create 70 new\njobs as a result of the win.\n\n### 'Extra capacity'\n\n\"We felt qualified to be able to bid for this award,\" says Mullen. \"As a\nstart-up, we are constrained by the number of things we can do simultaneously.\nThis gives us extra capacity.\"\n\nMullen worked in banking for 30 years, including a period as UK head of\nmarketing for HSBC and a three-year stint as chief executive of its phone and\nonline bank First Direct from 2011.\n\nAtom appointed Black Eyed Peas rapper Will.i.am as a board advisor, expected\nto raise the profile of the bank two years ago.  Critics sneer the move is a\nway for a complex firm to appeal to young consumers.\n\nBut Mullen says the musician brings new things to the table when he attends\nboard meetings three or four times a year.  \n\n### 'Changing conversations'\n\nMullen says: \"I think about banking all day, every day. That goes for the rest\nof the board. Will.i.am changes conversations around the table. He talks to\ndifferent sets of people, has access to different sets of people and gives us\ndifferent insights. It very useful to hear what he has to say.\"\n\nFrom US rappers, disgraced star fund managers, to young couples buying their\nfirst home, Atom's [Mark Mullen ](http://www.altfi.com/people/mark-mullen)runs\nwith a mixed crowd.\n\n### Sign up to the Daily Disruptor Newsletter\n\nYour Email:\n\n[![](https://www.altfi.com/images/ext/brighttalk-23-04-mpu.png)](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16919/395213?utm_source=AltFi+News&utm_medium=brighttalk&utm_campaign=395213)\n\n### Companies in this Article:\n\n[![Atom Bank](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/atom-\nbank.png)](/companies/atom-bank)\n\n[![Monzo](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/monzo.png)](/companies/monzo)\n\n[![RBS](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/rbs.png)](/companies/rbs)\n\n[![Revolut](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/revolut.jpg)](/companies/revolut)\n\n[![Bank of England](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/bank-of-\nengland.png)](/companies/bank-of-england)\n\n[![Barclays](https://www.altfi.com/images/companies/barclays.png)](/companies/barclays)\n\n### People in this Article:\n\n[\n\n#### Mark Mullen\n\nAtom Bank  \nCEO and Co-Founder\n\n](/people/mark-mullen)\n\n### More like this:\n\n[](https://www.altfi.com/article/6389_revolut-makes-crypto-and-gold-trading-\nfree-for-all-customers)\n\n## [Revolut makes crypto and gold trading \u2018free\u2019 for all\ncustomers](https://www.altfi.com/article/6389_revolut-makes-crypto-and-gold-\ntrading-free-for-all-customers)\n\n2 April 2020  \nAisling Finn\n\n[](https://www.altfi.com/article/6400_here-are-the-side-projects-fintechs-are-\nlaunching-to-ease-strain-of-coronavirus)\n\n## [Here are the side projects fintechs are launching to ease strain of\ncoronavirus](https://www.altfi.com/article/6400_here-are-the-side-projects-\nfintechs-are-launching-to-ease-strain-of-coronavirus)\n\n6 April 2020  \nAisling Finn\n\n[](https://www.altfi.com/article/6393_more-bcr-chaos-nationwide-\nreturns-50m-new-100m-bcr-pool-announced)\n\n## [More BCR chaos: Nationwide returns \u00a350m, new \u00a3100m BCR Pool\nannounced](https://www.altfi.com/article/6393_more-bcr-chaos-nationwide-\nreturns-50m-new-100m-bcr-pool-announced)\n\n3 April 2020  \nOliver Smith\n\n[](https://www.altfi.com/article/6386_finance-apps-see-20-coronavirus-surge-\nwith-paypal-monzo-and-barclays-taking-the-lead)\n\n## [Finance apps see 20% coronavirus surge with PayPal, Monzo and Barclays\ntaking the lead](https://www.altfi.com/article/6386_finance-apps-\nsee-20-coronavirus-surge-with-paypal-monzo-and-barclays-taking-the-lead)\n\n2 April 2020  \nOliver Smith\n\n[](https://www.altfi.com/article/6398_london-based-open-banking-fintech-\nyapily-raises-13m)\n\n## [ London-based Open Banking fintech Yapily raises\n$13m](https://www.altfi.com/article/6398_london-based-open-banking-fintech-\nyapily-raises-13m)\n\n6 April 2020  \nJohn Reynolds\n\n####  [About AltFi](/about)\n\n_AltFi_ provides market-leading news, opinion, insights and events for the\nrapidly-growing alternative finance and fintech community.

It allows a web server to return a header that specifies\nanother server as the host of its resources, in effect deputizing the stand-in\nto act as the [Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-\nUS/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin), the first-party source of content.\n\n\"The ability to redirect clients to use another server in a transparent,\npersistent fashion brings some obvious security concerns,\" said Nottingham in\nhis post.\n\nA paper titled \"[Alternative (ab)uses for HTTP Alternative\nServices](https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot19/presentation/tiwari),\" by\nboffins Trishita Tiwari, who co-authored the paper while at Boston University\nand is currently a cyber-security PhD student at Cornell University, and Ari\nTrachtenberg, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Boston\nUniversity, makes these obvious security concerns more evident.\n\n[HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) are\na way for clients and servers to communicate metadata during a request-\nresponse interaction. An Alternative Services header, returned with a response\nto a client request, might look something like this:\n\nAlt-Svc: h2=\"new.example.org:443\"; ma=600\n\nThis tells the client that for the next ten minutes (600 seconds), it can\nconnect to new.example.org on port 443 using the HTTP/2 protocol. The redirect\ninformation might also include an optional persist parameter indicating that\nthe alternative service can be remembered after session and network changes.\n\nAccording to Tiwari and Trachtenberg, Google uses Alternative Services to\nadvertise an alternate endpoint for serving content via its UDP-based QUIC\nprotocol. Meanwhile Facebook, among other websites, detects Tor client\nbrowsers and uses Alternative Services to point users to onion hidden service\nendpoints. The protocol is supported by desktop browsers like Brave, Chrome,\nFirefox, Opera and Tor, as well as various mobile browsers.\n\nThe researchers found that the Alt-Svc header can be used to force a Firefox\nor Tor user to scan any TCP ports of any host accessible to the victim. They\nreported this vulnerability to Mozilla, which issued a fix for\n[CVE-2019-11728](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11728) in its July\nrelease of Firefox 68 (which also covers Tor, based on Firefox ESR).\n\nThey also implemented this attack on Chrome and Chromium-based Brave using\nQUIC as an Alt-Svc endpoint. The researcher say they've disclosed this to\nGoogle and discussions about mitigations are underway; QUIC is currently\nhidden from Chrome users behind an experimental flag and must be activated by\nthe user.\n\n\"The basis of this attack is the observation that if a website specifies an\nAlt-Svc header to a secondary host with an HTTP/2/QUIC endpoint, then browsers\nimmediately try to initiate a handshake with the secondary host, without\nperforming any checks on the host or port,\" the researchers explain in their\npaper. \"The secondary host could even be a private IP or localhost, and the\nport could be on the browser\u2019s HTTP port blacklist.\"\n\nAlt-Svc also provides a way to bypass the Safe Browsing system used by Brave,\nChrome and Firefox. \"[I]f a clean, whitelisted first-party specifies a black\nlisted domain as its Alt-Svc, then the Safe Browsing checks are skipped and\nall content is loaded from the malicious domain,\" the research paper explains,\nnoting that the blocked site must present the certificate of the clean site,\nwhich would require collusion between the two.\n\nThe header also provides a way to avoid online site checking tools like\nVirusTotal, URLVoid, Sucuri and IPVoid, the researchers say, noting that\nsecurity checks like Safe Browsing need to not only check the first-party\ndomain but also the designated Alt-Svc domain before marking websites safe.\n\nDistributed denial of service attacks are possible in Firefox and Tor because,\nunlike Chromium-based browser, they do not remember broken endpoints. Thus\nit's possible to use an iframe to create a reload loop that would force\nrepeated TLS connection attempts, creating a denial of service attack.\n\nWhat's more, Alt-Svc can be used to track people despite privacy protections.\n\"By specifying a unique Alt-Svc for each user, and observing subsequent user\nrequests, an attacker could track a user both as a first-party website and a\nthird-party iframe or image,\" the paper explains.\n\nAlong similar lines, network service providers can abuse Alt-Svc to extract\notherwise unavailable web history data through the observation of resource\nloading.\n\nIn an email to _The Register_ , Tiwari said Mozilla addressed the port\nscanning and DDOS vulnerability with a patch that reduced the surface area of\nthe attack by preventing Alt-Svc connections to certain sensitive non-HTTP\nports.\n\n\"While this does not entirely eliminate the underlying issue (as is often the\ncase with patches for many side-channel attacks), this patch brought Mozilla's\nexposure down to the same level as Chrome and Brave (which most would consider\nto be an acceptable level of exposure),\" she said.\n\nThe Safe Browsing issues discussed in the paper have yet to be fully\naddressed. \"I was unconvinced of the explanation that Google provided us on\nhow they address this issue,\" she said.\n\n![Someone peeking over their desk out of\nsight](https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/08/05/shutterstock_hiding_from_computer.jpg?x=174&y=115&crop=1)\n\n## Googlers hate it!

This is really unfortunate given that Safe Browsing is employed\nby not just Chrome, but also Firefox, Brave, etc. and so is relied upon by a\nlot of people.\"\n\nTiwari said that the security implications mentioned in Nottingham's 2016 blog\npost were incorporated into the Alt-Svc spec.\n\n\"The spec does attempt to address these issues, but the mitigations proposed\nthere (i.e., clearing the Alt-Svc cache when the user clears their browser\ncache) are not strong enough,\" she said.\n\n\"Browser vendors understand this and are now proposing much stronger\nmitigations like cache isolation (which should, in my opinion, be included in\nthe spec so that it is not at the mercy of individual browser vendors to\nimplement it \u2013 user tracking has become a rising issue, and it is high time\nthat these RFCs start requiring cache isolation upfront).\"\n\n\"The rest of the attacks we show in the paper stem from how the Alt-Svc spec\nwas improperly implemented, so, in a sense, the remaining attacks weren't\nfundamental design flaws, but rather flaws in the way browser vendors\nimplemented the design,\" she said. \u00ae\n\n[ Tips and corrections\n](mailto:corrections@theregister.co.uk?subject=%5Bcorrection%5D%20Header%20aches%20in%20Firefox%2C%20Tor%2C%20Brave%20and%20Chrome%20as%20HTTP%20opens%20new%20security%20holes&body=re:%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk/2019/08/13/header_banged_for_bafflingly_bad_behavior/\n\"Spotted an error or have a tip?

If analysts\nare correct and the world does eat less [animal-based\nprotein](https://www.barrons.com/articles/beyond-meat-price-\ncomparison-51559339044?mod=article_inline)\u2014in turn switching to products made\nby highflying start-ups such as [Beyond\nMeat](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/BYND) \u2014[other\nindustries](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-animal-health-business-is-\ngrowing-how-to-invest-in-it-51553906098?mod=article_inline) will undoubtedly\nbe affected.\n\nIn the case of Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND), Wall Street has already been\nwondering whether traditional protein producers, such as [Tyson\nFoods](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/TSN) (TSN) or [Sanderson\nFarms](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/SAFM) (SAFM), will face demand\ndestruction. But brokerage firm\n**[UBS](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/UBS) ** has another idea about an\nindustry which could face headwinds because of Beyond and its peers\u2014animal\nhealth.\n\nUBS doesn't mean the health of the animals. In fact, [animal welfare and\nenvironmental considerations](https://www.barrons.com/articles/beyond-meat-\nclimate-change-51559525367?mod=article_inline) are some of the reasons people\nare trying alternative meat. The firm is talking about the animal health\nindustry\u2014companies that make drugs and related products to keep pets and\nlivestock healthy, such as [Elanco Animal\nHealth](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/ELAN) (ELAN) and\n[Zoetis](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/ZTS) (ZTS). That industry could\nalso see falling demand from the rise of alt-meat.\n\n\u201cUBS forecasts the global plant-based meat market to reach about $50 billion\nby 2025,\u201d wrote analyst **Navin Jacob** in a Friday research report.\n\n**Read more:** [McDonald\u2019s Could Be Just What Beyond Meat Stock\nNeeds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mcdonalds-beyond-meat-\nstock-51572967566?mod=article_inline)\n\nJacob is actually a pharmaceutical analyst. Most alt-meat market size\nestimates come from food analysts and range from $15 billion to [$150\nbillion](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-beyond-meat-stock-because-it-\ncould-be-even-bigger-than-the-hype-analyst-\nsays-51568907148?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline) (depending on the time\nframe analysts are considering). Jacob\u2019s value for alternative-meat sales\nappears to split the difference between the pessimistic and optimistic\nscenarios.\n\nJacob goes on to quantify the impact on stocks under his coverage. [Elanco\nAnimal Health](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/ELAN) (ELAN) could be worth\n7% less than his current price target for the stock.\n[Zoetis](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/ZTS) (ZTS) value could drop 9%.\nThe value of more diversified [Merck](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/MRK)\n(MRK)\u2014which also has an animal-health franchise\u2014could drop by 2%, but that is\na \u201cnegligible amount,\u201d according to the analyst.\n\nUnderpinning his assumptions is a global growth rate for the alternative meat\nindustry of about 30% a year on average through 2025. Global protein\nconsumption is expected to advance 1.2% over the same period. By his math, the\ngrowth of alt-meat steals about 0.3 percentage point of growth each year from\nanimal-based proteins. It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but less traditional\nprotein demand means less need for livestock.\n\nOf course, 2025 feels like a long way off for investors. Still, this is a good\nthought experiment. After all, animal-health \u201cpure-play\u201d stocks are expensive.\nElanco and Zoetis trade for [21\ntimes](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elanco-stock-deal-to-acquire-bayer-\nanimal-health-business-51566312397?mod=article_inline) and [29\ntimes](https://www.barrons.com/articles/zoetis-stock-climbs-because-the-pet-\nbusiness-is-still-booming-51573141766?mod=article_inline) estimated 2020\nearnings, respectively.\n\nMerck (MRK), for comparison, trades at about 15 times next year\u2019s earnings and\nthe pharmaceutical components of the [S&P\n500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) trade for 14 times estimated\nearnings.\n\nInvestors should remember, though, that the alternative-meat industry is in\nits infancy. The world consumes 300 million tons of meat each year\u2014give or\ntake. Products from Beyond Meat and peers make up only a tiny fraction of\nprotein demand today. Predicting the path of alternative-meat demand is hard.\n\nBeyond Meat investors can attest to that difficulty. It manifests itself in\nstock volatility. Beyond shares are at $80.81 in recent trading, up more than\n220% from the $25 initial public offering price, but [down\n65%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/beyond-meat-stock-looks-\novervalued-51559347252?mod=article_inline) from their all time high.\n\n**Write to** Al Root at\n[allen.root@dowjones.com](mailto:allen.root@dowjones.com)\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### Beyond Meat Is Shaking Up the Meat Industry.

Products certified as kosher.\n\nThis ad, for an app that helps you locate food that isn\u2019t kosher-certified,\nprovides an interesting view into the ads that help fund alt-right podcasts,\nand the extent to which conspiracy theories drive so much in the alt-right\nworld.\n\nThe app is called KosChertified?, and it\u2019s available on Apple\u2019s App Store and\nGoogle Android.\n\nThe podcast, which we\u2019re not naming because we don\u2019t want to give it more\npublicity (if you want to know, just email me), has hosted the ad in at least\none episode. It was sandwiched between hateful screeds about immigration in\nthe United States and immigration in Europe.\n\nPeter Jalajas, CEO of the company behind KosChertified?, said in an email that\nthe app merely offers education to consumers. [One of the\nwebsites](http://www.thekosherquestion.com/) promoting the app asks why\nconsumers have been \u201ckept in the dark\u201d about kosher certification, and\ncautions ominously that \u201cthe tax exempt revenue flows to many programs and\ninstitutions worth examining for its effect on you and your interests\u201d \u2013\nmirroring the white nationalist conspiracy theories peddled on alt-right\nwebsites and podcasts such as the one on which his app is advertised.\n\nKosher certifiers check, for example, that meat and dairy products are\nstrictly separated and that animals are slaughtered in a humane way that\nensures minimal suffering. [About 41 percent of packaged food on\nsale](https://qz.com/407157/less-than-2-of-the-us-population-is-jewish-so-why-\nis-41-of-the-countrys-packaged-food-kosher/) in the U.S. is certified kosher,\naccording to market research firm Mintel.\n\nIt\u2019s also becoming more popular. A [2017 Food Business News\nreport](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/9015-the-trends-fueling-\nkosher-certification) described the recent boom in kosher certification as\ndriven not just by Jews, but also by other consumers concerned about taste,\nfood safety and dietary considerations.\n\nAside from vague proclamations about costs to consumers and concerns about why\nthe public has been kept in the dark about kosher certification, the\nKosChertified? website doesn\u2019t go into detail about why consumers should be\nconcerned.\n\nBut a quick look at its [active Twitter](https://twitter.com/KosChertified)\naccount (followed by white nationalist Richard Spencer and other racist\nTwitter users) shows it frequently tweets content criticizing Israel and\nblatant anti-Semitic messaging.\n\nFor example, whoever runs the account likes to include a pig emoji every time\nhe or she tweets about the website \u2013 an obvious allusion to pork, which is not\nkosher.\n\n![](https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image1.png)\n\nIn addition to the obvious anti-Israeli content, the account has tweeted clear\ndog whistles, such as [using the word\n\u201cgoyim](https://twitter.com/KosChertified/status/1035263103334674432),\u201d a\nHebrew word for non-Jews that white nationalists have been appropriating.\n\nAryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-\nDefamation League, said he\u2019s never heard of an anti-kosher app before, but\nhe\u2019s seen this sort of thing plenty of times.\n\n\u201cThe notion that there\u2019s this kosher mafia or kosher conspiracy is not new at\nall,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been allegations for decades that the kosher\ncertification industry is just a tool for Jews to rip off non-Jews. Fifteen\nyears ago, before the app economy, there were white supremacist websites that\nincluded reproductions of the kosher certified symbols, as a way of doing\nexactly what this website and app are trying to do.\u201d\n\nJalajas declined to be interviewed, but he sent a short statement,including\nthis explanation as to why his company is advertising on a white nationalist\npodcast:\n\nAs a small company, we are unable to purchase \u201cmainstream\u201d advertising at the\nrates they demand. We are forced to fund our marketing ventures in popular and\n\u201cedgy\u201d podcasts because this meets our budgetary constraints while delivering\nour message to large audiences that are intrigued by this inscrutable topic\nand delighted about the benefits our app offers.\n\n![](https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image2.png)\n\nThe website and app are run by Free Press Promotions LLC, which is based in\nSan Marcos, California, according to state records.\n\nWe found out about KosChertified? thanks to the efforts of our volunteer Hate\nSleuths. They\u2019re a team of volunteer readers who help us with research\nassignments. If you\u2019re interested in signing up, [go\nhere](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_xmkNb7oBRijiJBFG0rfAl9MarNg5ZNOyt8dnssm-L1J7UQ/viewform).\n\nHere are a couple of other nuggets the Hate Sleuths dug up in their research\nof the podcast:\n\n## **American white nationalists love to use other countries as examples.**\n\nSeveral Hate Sleuths noted that the podcast hosts often turned to Europe to\nillustrate their fears and hysteria about the impacts of immigration. Indeed,\nthe podcast referenced above has a regular section devoted entirely to Europe\nthat usually focuses on immigration. It also has an occasional report from\nSouth Africa.\n\nHowever, as one Hate Sleuth noted, the podcast relies on half-truths and false\nstatistics to paint Europe as a continent under siege by nonwhite immigrants.\nThat\u2019s a line President Donald Trump also has seized on during his presidency.\nLast year, for example,Trump [told a\nrally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/12/trump-\nasked-people-to-look-at-whats-happening-in-sweden-earlier-this-year-now-\nsweden-responds/) in Florida:\n\nWe\u2019ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what\u2019s happening in Germany,\nyou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe\nthis?\n\nTrump mentioned Sweden in reference to terrorist attacks by immigrants in\nEurope. But there hadn\u2019t been an attack in Sweden the night before, and at the\ntime of Trump\u2019s remarks the country hadn\u2019t seen an Islamist attack since 2010.\nAs The New York Times reported, Swedes found his [remarks\nbaffling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-\nsweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html).\n\n[In a tweet last month](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-\npolitics/2018/8/23/17772056/south-africa-trump-tweet-afriforum-white-farmers-\nviolence), Trump appeared to endorse [the conspiracy\ntheory](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/the-hate-report-the-story-behind-\ntrumps-south-africa-tweet/) that white farmers are being killed in a \u201cwhite\ngenocide\u201d in South Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that in both the Sweden and South Africa examples, Trump made\nclear that his source was Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. Which brings us to\nour next point.\n\n## **These guys love Tucker Carlson.**\n\nWe [have\nchronicled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/24/president-trump-\nis-pushing-white-nationalist-ideas-into-mainstream/?utm_term=.15e885e3d774)\nCarlson\u2019s slide from journalist to de-facto alt-right propagandist.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that has delighted the hosts of the podcast the Hate Sleuths\nlistened to.\n\nCarlson just gets it, the hosts like to say. Unlike other mainstream\nconservative news personalities such as Laura Ingraham, who are only just\nstarting to understand the issues important to white nationalists, Carlson has\nbeen on board for awhile, the hosts said.\n\n## **Join us!

Learn more at\n[revealnews.org](https://www.revealnews.org/) and subscribe to the Reveal\npodcast, produced with PRX, at\n[revealnews.org/podcast](https://www.revealnews.org/podcast).\n\nThe podcast ad starts breathlessly:\n\nWhat I'm about to introduce you to is a segment of our food culture that has\nbeen kept so low profile to the American public that virtually no one is aware\nof how dominant it is on our refrigerator and cupboard shelves.\n\nThe mysterious culprit? Products certified as kosher.\n\nThis ad, for an app that helps you locate food that isn't kosher-certified,\nprovides an interesting view into the ads that help fund alt-right podcasts,\nand the extent to which conspiracy theories drive so much in the alt-right\nworld.\n\nThe app is called KosChertified?, and it's available on Apple's App Store and\nGoogle Android.\n\nThe podcast, which we're not naming because we don't want to give it more\npublicity (if you want to know, just email me), has hosted the ad in at least\none episode. It was sandwiched between hateful screeds about immigration in\nthe United States and immigration in Europe.\n\nPeter Jalajas, CEO of the company behind KosChertified?, said in an email that\nthe app merely offers education to consumers. [One of the\nwebsites](http://www.thekosherquestion.com/) promoting the app asks why\nconsumers have been \"kept in the dark\" about kosher certification, and\ncautions ominously that \"the tax exempt revenue flows to many programs and\ninstitutions worth examining for its effect on you and your interests\" -\nmirroring the white nationalist conspiracy theories peddled on alt-right\nwebsites and podcasts such as the one on which his app is advertised.\n\nKosher certifiers check, for example, that meat and dairy products are\nstrictly separated and that animals are slaughtered in a humane way that\nensures minimal suffering. [About 41 percent of packaged food on\nsale](https://qz.com/407157/less-than-2-of-the-us-population-is-jewish-so-why-\nis-41-of-the-countrys-packaged-food-kosher/) in the U.S. is certified kosher,\naccording to market research firm Mintel.\n\nIt's also becoming more popular. A [2017 Food Business News\nreport](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/9015-the-trends-fueling-\nkosher-certification) described the recent boom in kosher certification as\ndriven not just by Jews, but also by other consumers concerned about taste,\nfood safety and dietary considerations.\n\nAside from vague proclamations about costs to consumers and concerns about why\nthe public has been kept in the dark about kosher certification, the\nKosChertified? website doesn't go into detail about why consumers should be\nconcerned.\n\nBut a quick look at its [active Twitter](https://twitter.com/KosChertified)\naccount (followed by white nationalist Richard Spencer and other racist\nTwitter users) shows it frequently tweets content criticizing Israel and\nblatant anti-Semitic messaging.\n\nFor example, whoever runs the account likes to include a pig emoji every time\nhe or she tweets about the website - an obvious allusion to pork, which is not\nkosher.\n\nIn addition to the obvious anti-Israeli content, the account has tweeted clear\ndog whistles, such as [using the word\n\"goyim](https://twitter.com/KosChertified/status/1035263103334674432),\" a\nHebrew word for non-Jews that white nationalists have been appropriating.\n\nAryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-\nDefamation League, said he's never heard of an anti-kosher app before, but\nhe's seen this sort of thing plenty of times.\n\n\"The notion that there's this kosher mafia or kosher conspiracy is not new at\nall,\" he said. \"There have been allegations for decades that the kosher\ncertification industry is just a tool for Jews to rip off non-Jews. Fifteen\nyears ago, before the app economy, there were white supremacist websites that\nincluded reproductions of the kosher certified symbols, as a way of doing\nexactly what this website and app are trying to do.\"\n\nJalajas declined to be interviewed, but he sent a short statement,including\nthis explanation as to why his company is advertising on a white nationalist\npodcast:\n\nAs a small company, we are unable to purchase \"mainstream\" advertising at the\nrates they demand. We are forced to fund our marketing ventures in popular and\n\"edgy\" podcasts because this meets our budgetary constraints while delivering\nour message to large audiences that are intrigued by this inscrutable topic\nand delighted about the benefits our app offers.\n\nThe website and app are run by Free Press Promotions LLC, which is based in\nSan Marcos, California, according to state records.\n\nWe found out about KosChertified? thanks to the efforts of our volunteer Hate\nSleuths. They're a team of volunteer readers who help us with research\nassignments.

Indeed,\nthe podcast referenced above has a regular section devoted entirely to Europe\nthat usually focuses on immigration. It also has an occasional report from\nSouth Africa.\n\nHowever, as one Hate Sleuth noted, the podcast relies on half-truths and false\nstatistics to paint Europe as a continent under siege by nonwhite immigrants.\nThat's a line President Donald Trump also has seized on during his presidency.\nLast year, for example,Trump [told a\nrally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/12/trump-\nasked-people-to-look-at-whats-happening-in-sweden-earlier-this-year-now-\nsweden-responds/) in Florida:\n\nWe've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany,\nyou look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe\nthis?\n\nTrump mentioned Sweden in reference to terrorist attacks by immigrants in\nEurope. But there hadn't been an attack in Sweden the night before, and at the\ntime of Trump's remarks the country hadn't seen an Islamist attack since 2010.\nAs The New York Times reported, Swedes found his [remarks\nbaffling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-\nsweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html).\n\n[In a tweet last month](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-\npolitics/2018/8/23/17772056/south-africa-trump-tweet-afriforum-white-farmers-\nviolence), Trump appeared to endorse [the conspiracy\ntheory](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/the-hate-report-the-story-behind-\ntrumps-south-africa-tweet/) that white farmers are being killed in a \"white\ngenocide\" in South Africa.\n\nIt's notable that in both the Sweden and South Africa examples, Trump made\nclear that his source was Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. Which brings us to\nour next point.\n\nThese guys love Tucker Carlson.\n\nWe [have\nchronicled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/24/president-trump-\nis-pushing-white-nationalist-ideas-into-mainstream/?utm_term=.15e885e3d774)\nCarlson's slide from journalist to de-facto alt-right propagandist.\n\nIt's a move that has delighted the hosts of the podcast the Hate Sleuths\nlistened to.\n\nCarlson just gets it, the hosts like to say. Unlike other mainstream\nconservative news personalities such as Laura Ingraham, who are only just\nstarting to understand the issues important to white nationalists, Carlson has\nbeen on board for awhile, the hosts said.\n\nJoin us!

With the service, financial advisors will be able to\naccess RateSetter's portal to help advise their clients on P2P investments. It\nhas always been the plan to open up RateSetter to the advisor community,\naccording to the startup's chief investment officer Mario Lupori, cited by\nPeer2Peer Finance News.\n\n[ ![Global VC Backed Funding For Alt Lenders](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5dfb8294855cc2332a35f643?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n](https://i.insider.com/5dfb8294855cc2332a35f643) Business Insider\nIntelligence\n\nThe announcement comes after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\nintroduced new rules in the P2P lending space, and could help RateSetter\nremain successful.\n\nThe FCA's new rules -- confirmed in\n[June](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18931300.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wb3N0L2xlYWRpbmctYmFua3MtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWNyeXB0by1pbi0yMDIwLXVrLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LXAycC1sZW5kaW5nLXJ1bGVzLW1vbmV5MjAyMC1maW50ZWNocy1leWUtYmlnLXRlY2gtY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi0yMDE5LTY/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBb6a921da)\n-- include limiting investments for new retail investors to 10% of their\ninvestable assets. Likely in response to this, other P2P lenders have shifted\ntheir focus from solely focusing on individual retail investors to targeting\ninstitutional investors.\n\nFunding Circle, for example, closed its [fourth\nsecuritization](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18931300.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3Jwb3JhdGUuZnVuZGluZ2NpcmNsZS5jb20vbWVkaWEvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvZm91cnRoLXNlY3VyaXRpc2F0aW9uLWZ1bmRpbmctY2lyY2xlLWxvYW5zLXVudmVpbGVk/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBd88ae3dc)\nfrom Waterfall Asset Management, worth \u00a3232 million ($304 million), in July as\npart of the latter's \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) investment in Funding Circle\nloans. RateSetter, on the other hand, [continues to\nbet](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18931300.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wb3N0L3JvYmluaG9vZC1sYXVuY2hlcy1jYXNoLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtZmVhdHVyZS1hbHQtbGVuZGVyLXJhaXNlcy0yNDRtLWxpYnJhLW1lbWJlcnMtdXJnZWQtdG8tcmVjb25zaWRlci1pbnZvbHZlbWVudC0yMDE5LTEw/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB1e7d5db7)\non individual investors to fund its loans, and currently has 80,000 self-\ndirected investors on its platform.\n\nBy working with licensed financial advisors, RateSetter has found a way around\nthe new rules. The aforementioned investment restriction doesn't apply to\nthose that have received regulated financial advice. Hence, by opening its\nplatform to advisors, retail investors could potentially pour more money into\nRateSetter's platform.\n\nAdditionally, with the P2P lending space getting more regulated and\ntransparent under the new rules, as lenders will have to provide a minimum\namount of information to investors and assess the knowledge and experience of\nconsumers ahead of investing, it seems likely that financial advisors will be\nmore willing to diversify a client's portfolio with P2P investments.\n\nThe P2P lending space had a bumpy year in 2019, which will probably continue\nthroughout the next year. In May, [for\nexample](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18931300.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wb3N0L3NlY29uZC11ay1maW50ZWNoLWZhaWxzLXdpdGhpbi1hLXdlZWstcmV2b2x1dC1nYXJuZXJzLWhpZ2hlc3QtbnVtYmVyLW9mLW5lb2JhbmstY3VzdG9tZXItY29tcGxhaW50cy1pbnN1cmFuY2UtZmlybS1leHBvc2VzLWFsbW9zdC0xLWJpbGxpb24tY3VzdG9tZXItZmlsZXMtMjAxOS01/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB54bf0c8c),\nLendy went into administration after it was revealed that the P2P lender had\nrising default levels, and it was\n[soon](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18931300.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzIwMTkvb2N0LzIzL3BlZXItdG8tcGVlci1sZW5kZXItZnVuZGluZy1zZWN1cmUtYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24tcGF3bmJyb2tlcg/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBec626b5c)\nfollowed by Funding Secure.\n\nAs the regulations shake up the industry and force players, including some of\nthe biggest, like RateSetter and Funding Circle, to expand their services, we\nwill likely see more smaller players struggle. And while tapping financial\nadvisors will likely help RateSetter remain successful, it should also\nconsider institutional investments to ensure there won't be any disruptions\nfor borrowers on its platform.\n\n _ **Want to read more stories like this one?
