Due to\nCOVID-19 and the enforced closures of indoor sporting venues, community\ncentres and gyms, a number of PCYC Queensland activities have temporarily been\nsuspended, except for the provision of essential services. All other programs,\nfitness classes, gyms and activities have been suspended until further notice.\n\nPCYC Queensland chief executive officer Phil Schultz said due to unprecedented\nchanges in society caused by the virus, people's health and wellbeing and\nconnection to community has become more important than ever.\n\n\"The impact that COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on all our lives is\nextraordinary. \"During this challenging and isolating time, Activ8 @home\nprovides an essential way for the community to remain connected, fit and\nhealthy,\" said Mr Schultz.\n\n\"For this reason, PCYC Queensland has made the program free and available to\nthe entire community.\n\n\"Already more than 1,100 members have joined the group from across the state,\nand they are already positively supporting and interacting with one another\nwhich is great.\"\n\nActiv8 @home is supported by PCYC Queensland Youth Ambassador and boxing icon\nJeff Horn, whose upcoming fight against Tim Tszyu has been postponed till\nfurther notice.\n\n\"With my fight being postponed, I'm definitely looking for ways to maintain my\nfitness.\n\n\"Activ8 @home is a great online program that provides effective workouts and\ntips that can benefit the whole family, to stay fit and healthy at home.\"\n\nTo join the community and sign up to the program visit www.pcyc.org.au or\nsearch for the PCYC Queensland Activ8 @home Facebook group.\n\n#### More Stories\n\n  * [ Coronavirus count eclipses 4000, death toll claims 21 ](/news/how-many-cases-there-are-in-australia/3984063/)\n  * [ Photo shows brutal reality of essential job ](/news/photo-shows-brutal-reality-of-essential-job/3986753/)\n  * [ Backflip after love ban confusion ](/news/backflip-after-love-ban-confusion/3987116/)\n\n#### More Stories\n\n  * [ Coronavirus count eclipses 4000, death toll claims 21 ](/news/how-many-cases-there-are-in-australia/3984063/)\n  * [ Photo shows brutal reality of essential job ](/news/photo-shows-brutal-reality-of-essential-job/3986753/)\n  * [ Backflip after love ban confusion ](/news/backflip-after-love-ban-confusion/3987116/)\n\n0\n\ncoronavirus\n\n[ Read More ](/topic/coronavirus/#biography) Login to follow\n\nfitness\n\n[ Read More ](/topic/fitness/#biography) Login to follow\n\n[__coronavirus](/topic/coronavirus/) [__fitness](/topic/fitness/)\n\n[![Ipswich Advertiser](https://media.apnarm.net.au/source/ipswich-\nadvertiser_t130.gif) ](http://www.ipswichadvertiser.com.au/)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## Subscriber Exclusives\n\n[ ![Bruce Highway horror scene a heartbreaking\nreminder](https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/04/07/v3imagesbin4a7989f74e2cf8b22a4fe374ef748599-dgezjankyfvzgrum4u2_ct677x380.jpg)\n](/news/bruce-highway-horror-scene-a-heartbreaking-reminde/3991100/)\n\n[\n\n###  premium_icon Bruce Highway horror scene a heartbreaking reminder\n\n](/news/bruce-highway-horror-scene-a-heartbreaking-reminde/3991100/)\n\nNews The family of a man killed in a horrific head-on crash near Farleigh is\npreparing for a tough Easter without a loved one.\n\n[ ![GROUNDED: Stunning images reveal Brisbane Airport\u2019s\nshutdown](https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/04/08/v3imagesbine6a2a30255910fa0c0e2e32a770078f8-6to660ozuqcicgzt4u2_ct677x380.jpg)\n](/news/grounded-stunning-images-reveal-brisbane-airports-/3991810/)\n\n[\n\n###  premium_icon GROUNDED: Stunning images reveal Brisbane Airport\u2019s shutdown\n\n](/news/grounded-stunning-images-reveal-brisbane-airports-/3991810/)\n\nBusiness Incredible images from Brisbane Airport have revealed hundreds of\nplanes parked on the runway as air travel grinds to a halt throughout the\nworld.\n\n  * 8th Apr 2020 7:46 PM\n\n[ ![Why day 10 of COVID-19 infection is most\ndangerous](https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/04/08/v3imagesbinc91b95a197ee05631a75aea8cc918ab3-c9bz6cbiw2wh6nbu4u2_ct677x380.jpg)\n](/news/why-day-10-of-covid-19-infection-is-most-dangerous/3991862/)\n\n[\n\n###  premium_icon Why day 10 of COVID-19 infection is most dangerous\n\n](/news/why-day-10-of-covid-19-infection-is-most-dangerous/3991862/)\n\nHealth Day 10 has emerged as D-Day for COVID-19 patients who fail to show\nsigns of improvement.

isolation and social distancing\nrules.\n\nBranch manager of Emerald PCYC Sergeant Julia Henderson said while everyone\nwas facing the same issues in relation to COVID-19, it was significantly\nimpacting young people in the region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s restricting access and preventing them from being able to participate in\nall their normal activities like sports, activities, hanging out with friends,\ngoing to the cinema and shops,\u201d she said.\n\nThe federal government recently announced the closure of all skate parks,\npublic playgrounds and outside gyms, followed by Queensland government\nenforcing the two-person limit to limit the spread of COVID-19.\n\nEarlier this week, Central Highlands Regional Council were forced to fill the\nEmerald skatepark with sand after police raised concerns about the towns youth\nignoring new rules.\n\nSgt Henderson said while it was great to see majority of the community doing\nthe right thing, it was important that everyone was abiding by the rules.\n\n\u201cIt can be tough for young people to appreciate the seriousness of some\nissues, but I definitely think most understand this situation, as it impacting\nevery single

Moreover, for brokers\ninterested in the platform, it is possible to customize the platform to appear\nindividual to the broker itself, providing traders with a unique experience\nand feel.\n\n## Format and Build\n\nLeverate\u2019s Activ8 trading platform is generally divided into 3 underlying\ncategories: 'Trading', 'Strategies', and 'Masters'. Each category focuses on\nits own features, and allows traders to navigate through the platform to\neasily locate their desired destination. The trading section includes all\ntrading assets and instruments in an orderly fashion, inducing a simple\ninterface that allows for a fast location of the desired asset.\n\nIn addition, there is an implanted footer that can be viewed across all\ncategories, which summarizes the account information, including equity,\nbalance, and open P/L. The footer further details the total number of open\npositions, number of pending orders, and clearly shows a breakdown of open P/L\nspread across the account\u2019s utilized assets and EAs, at any given time.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/02/Activ8-Footer-1.jpg)\n\n## Categories\n\nThe trading category is further divided into several subcategories of each\nasset type: 'Commodities', 'Forex', 'Indexes', and 'Other'. Each brokerage can\nselect which categories each user can see upon login to the system. This\nenables the brokerage to only offer certain categories (for example\n'strategies') for certain users, and to use a category as a future selling\npoint to retain or upsell a client\u2019s account.\n\nUsers can 'favorite' any asset that will then be added to their respective\nfavorites list. Traders can also simply type the name of the desired asset\ninto a search bar to find it even faster. Once a trader clicks on an asset,\nthe system knows to mark the asset for future use, and these assets will\nappear toward the top of the assets list upon the next login to the platform.\n\nUpon clicking on an asset, its corresponding page will appear, showing the\nuser a chart, and providing easy trading functions on the left side of the\nscreen. The trader can then determine the size of the trade and easily enter\ninto a position.\n\nFollowing the execution of an order, the entry price will be shown with a\nblack line on the chart. If the trade inputs a stop loss and take profit,\ntheir respective levels will be shown on the chart as well, allowing for a\nfull view of the position details with very little effort on behalf of the\nclient. Below the chart, users can see their full list of open positions or\npending orders of that particular asset, and click on each order to smoothly\nnavigate between them.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Activ8-Trading-\nSection-AUDCAD.jpg)\n\n## Suggested articles\n\nFBS Launches Online Trading School - FBS Trading Bootcamp[Go to article\n>>](https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/fbs-launches-online-\ntrading-school-fbs-trading-bootcamp/)\n\nThe 'Strategies' category provides an array of expert advisors (EA/bots),\nwhich generally focus on a particular group of assets or currency pairs. By\nclicking on a specific EA, users can view its historical performance, and then\nselect whether or not they wish to enable its use across their own portfolio.\nTraders can select a percentage of their account equity that they desire to\nallocate to the use of that particular strategy (EA).\n\nLeverate has really made using EAs much easier than in the past. By\ncomparison, the widely popular Metatrader 4 platform requires a thorough\nprocess to implement any EA, which has to be added manually by each user, and\ncan only be applied through files saved on an individual computer.\n\n## Dashboard\n\nThe Activ8 Dashboard grants the user a centralized point of information,\npertaining to the portfolio. The segment shows a clear view of deposited\namounts, a large-scale P/L and equity chart, used and free margin levels, and\ntrading and strategy distribution charts. This section is quite helpful, as it\ngives the user a clear and concise overview of the account and the trading\nactivity that is encompasses.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/02/Activ8-Dashboard.jpg)\n\n## Side Display - Analysis\n\nLeverate has also thought about how to incorporate external market analysis\ninto its trading platform. On the right side of the interface, there is a\ndisplay that is further divided into 3 categories: 'Market Analysis', 'News',\nand 'Calendar'.\n\nThe market analysis section includes external technical analysis provided by\nexternal content provider Auto chartist. Each entry in this section analyses a\nspecific asset or currency pair, providing a short subtext description and a\nchart with technical indicators. A simple click of the mouse on the chart\nitself will enlarge the image to show the user the analysis on the chart\nitself.\n\n![](https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Activ8-Market-\nAnalysis.jpg)\n\nBoth the news and calendar sections implement information and data supplied by\nMTE Media, and give users additional information that can be used to reach a\ntrading decision. It is worth noting that alternative or additional external\ncontent providers could be implemented by Leverate at any time.\n\n## Where to Improve\n\nWhile the overall functionality of Leverate\u2019s Activ8 platform is generally\npositive, there are a few areas that can be improved. For instance, there\ncurrently is no fund management system integrated into the platform. For\nbrokerages that work with external portfolio managers to manage client funds,\nthis can present an issue, since the platform does not currently support this\nfeature.\n\nBy comparison, Metaquotes provides its Multiterminal platform to allow for the\nsimultaneous management of multiple accounts. Additionally, there are\nfinancial technology providers who have developed MAM and PAMM systems that\ncan be integrated into trading platforms through a plugin, thereby enabling\nfund management capabilities for FX and CFD brokerages.\n\nAnother facet of the platform that was rather lacking was individual risk\nmanagement. Risk management is important to the long-term success of online\ntrading, and the system currently lacks a centralized framework that will\nnotify clients declining free margin, high exposure levels, and dangerous\nequity levels that can place the portfolio at risk.\n\nFinally, the aforementioned 'Strategy' category is extremely user friendly.\nWhile the system allows for the simple allocation of an equity percentage to\nbe attributed to a particular trading strategy (EA), some clients might find\nit confusing, since the platform does not allow for the allocation of an\namount in USD, EUR, or any other fiat currency.\n\nIn other words, traders are forced to select a percentage level for a\nparticular strategy, following a manual calculation of the percentage\u2019s\nvaluation at any given time. As the equity of the portfolio changes, so to\ndoes the value that be allocated to each strategy, based on the fixed\npercentage that was set by the user.\n\nOverall, Leverate\u2019s Activ8 trading platform provides both brokerages and\ntraders with many features that are unavailable in some of the industry\u2019s\nleading trading platforms. According to Leverate, the development of the\nActiv8 and Optim8 systems have been gaining momentum, as popularity increases\namong FX and CFD providers and end users alike.\n\nShare this article\n\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Product+Review%3A+Leverate%E2%80%99s+Activ8+Trading+Platform+https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/product-review-leverates-activ8-trading-platform/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/product-review-leverates-activ8-trading-platform/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/product-review-leverates-activ8-trading-platform/&title=Product+Review%3A+Leverate%E2%80%99s+Activ8+Trading+Platform&source=https://www.financemagnates.com \"Share This\")\n  * [Telegram Finance Magnates Telegram Channel](https://t.me/share/url?text=Product+Review%3A+Leverate%E2%80%99s+Activ8+Trading+Platform&url=https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/product-review-leverates-activ8-trading-platform/ \"Share This\")\n  * [ __](mailto:?subject=You\u2019re going to love it: Product Review: Leverate\u2019s Activ8 Trading Platform&body=Check out this article from Finance Magnates: https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/technology/product-review-leverates-activ8-trading-platform/ \"Share this\")\n\nTags:[forex](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/forex/) /\n[innovation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/innovation/) /\n[Leverate](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/leverate/) /\n[technology](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/technology/) / [trading\nplatform](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/trading-platform/)\n\nGot a news tip?

Youth Sports Alliance\n\nSchool is starting in just a couple weeks, which also means that after-school\nprograms with the Youth Sports Alliance will begin soon.\n\n[](https://cpa.ds.npr.org/kpcw/audio/2019/08/08-randy-emily-b-ysa.mp3)\n\nListen\n\nListening...\n\n/\n\n3:05\n\nYSA Youth Programs Director Heather Sims says the organization has added new\nprograms to their Get Out and Play and ACTiV8 lineups, including welding,\nrowing and more.\n\n\u201cWe've got a new program with some local Summit County sheriffs called 'Blue\nLine Combatives,' and they're going to be doing some self-defense classes,\"\nSims said. \"As well as cooking and mountain biking, and then we also have\nprograms out in South Summit now, and so they're going to be doing biathlon\nand some mountain biking and photography as well as our Get Out and Play\nprograms, which is mountain biking and triathlon.\u201d\n\nGet Out and Play programming is geared toward younger students, from first\nthrough fifth grades, while ACTiV8 targets sixth through ninth graders. Sims\nsays YSA\u2019s after-school programming begins in full in mid-September.\n\nLast year was the first year programming was offered in the South Summit\nSchool District. As well as doing outreach in that area, Sims says YSA has a\nlong-term plan to provide programming to all of Summit County and into Wasatch\nCounty.\n\n\u201cWe have such great activities here in Park City and great partners,\" Sims\nsaid. \"Some of our partners actually have employees in those areas, and they\nwork full-time, too, and they want their kids to have the same opportunities\nas our local Park City kids.\u201d\n\nScholarships are available for Get Out and Play and ACTiV8 participants who\ndemonstrate financial need, like students who qualify for free school lunch.\nYSA also provides financial assistance for athletes on YSA member teams,\nincluding Park City Ski & Snowboard and Wasatch Freestyle Foundation, through\nthe YSA Stein Eriksen Dare to Dream Scholarship. Applications opened Aug. 1\nand close Sept. 4. YSA Development Director Jana Dalton says 100 athletes\ntypically apply.\n\n\u201cA lot of these kids try programs and Get Out and Play, and they love it, so\nthey want to move on and continue in their sport,\" Dalton said. \"But\noftentimes it's difficult with finances and may not be affordable for\neverybody, so we have the Stein Erickson Opportunity Endowment that provides\nscholarships to these seven winter sports clubs and junior-level athletes.\u201d\n\nYSA scholarships are partly funded by the organizations\u2019 JANS Winter Welcome\nevent. This year\u2019s fundraiser is Oct. 26, and Dalton says tickets are 70% sold\nout for the evening of dinner, dancing and auction.\n\n\u201cWe also have our opportunity drawing, so all of the sales from the\nopportunity drawing go directly back to the seven winter sports clubs,\" Dalton\nsaid. \"And that grand prize this year is a Greek island cruise for two on a\n148-passenger sailboat, so it's a little different than your traditional\ncruise ship. It's very unique, and it's going to be an amazing trip.\u201d\n\nGuardians can register their students for YSA\u2019s programming at back-to-school\nnights and online at [ysaparkcity.org](https://ysaparkcity.org/), where people\ncan also find more information about programming, scholarships and the JANS\nWinter Welcome event.\n\nTags:\n\n[Youth Sports Alliance](/term/youth-sports-alliance)\n\n[Get Out and Play](/term/get-out-and-play)\n\n[activ8](/term/activ8)\n\n[Jans Winter Welcome](/term/jans-winter-welcome)\n\n[Share](http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy3n7raro&t=New%20After-\nschool%20Programs%20With%20Youth%20Sports%20Alliance\n\"Share\")[Tweet](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy3n7raro&text=New%20After-\nschool%20Programs%20With%20Youth%20Sports%20Alliance\n\"Tweet\")[Email](mailto:?subject=New%20After-\nschool%20Programs%20With%20Youth%20Sports%20Alliance&body=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy3n7raro\n\"Email\")\n\n[View the discussion thread.](http://npr-\nkpcw.disqus.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kpcw.org%2Fpost%2Fnew-after-school-\nprograms-youth-sports-alliance)\n\n### Related Content\n\n[](/post/ysa-looking-expand-all-summit-county-after-successful-pilot-south-\nsummit-middle-school)\n\n## [YSA Looking To Expand Into All Of Summit County After Successful Pilot At\nSouth Summit Middle School](/post/ysa-looking-expand-all-summit-county-after-\nsuccessful-pilot-south-summit-middle-school)\n\nBy [David Boyle](/people/david-boyle) _\u2022_ Jun 13, 2019\n\n[\n![](https://www.kpcw.org/sites/kpcw/files/styles/medium/public/201708/YSAlogo-\nBadge-Color.jpg) ](/post/ysa-looking-expand-all-summit-county-after-\nsuccessful-pilot-south-summit-middle-school)\n\nLocal Nonprofit Youth Sports Alliance provides after school activities to\nstudents in the Park City School District, originally the program was focused\non involving elementary students in winter sports activities but has since\nexpanded into more activities and more grade levels.

In the comments of these videos, fans have called the\ndepictions a disrespect to Kizuna Ai's original character. Coupled with rumors\nthat the Multiple A.I. project (of which these videos were representative of)\nwill result in Kizuna Ai's original voice actress being phased out of future\nvideos entirely, the videos have become emblematic of the problems fans are\nhaving with the current direction of Kizuna Ai.\n\n![](/img/spacer.gif)\n\nComments on bilibili's video regarding the issue are being moderated. Any\ncomment containing Activ8 (the name of the corporate group Kizuna Ai belongs\nto) or its abbreviation A8 are made invisible to other users. Chinese fans are\nexpressing their displeasure about the situation by unsubscribing from the\nchannel entirely. A [livestream](https://live.bilibili.com/5465473) monitoring\nKizuna Ai's subscribers indicates that the bilibili channel has lost roughly\n100,000 subscribers in just over a week. At the channel's peak on August 6,\nthe subscriber count was just shy of one million; at the time of this\npublication, the number is just over 900,000.\n\nThe multiple Kizuna Ai project was first unveiled on May 25 in a\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWwohKOmgqA) titled \"If I say there is\n4 Kizuna Ai's will you believe me? #1.\" A fifth Kizuna Ai, who speaks Chinese,\nwas introduced at the Virtual YouTuber's second birthday concert event \"A.I.\nParty! 2019 ~ hello, how r u? ~\" on June 30, and on the YouTube channel on\nJuly 1.\n\nThe Chinese Kizuna Ai is so far the only offshoot of the character to receive\na different character design from the original, although all the Kizuna AIs\nhave a different [voice actor](/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=75). None of the\nidentities of Kizuna Ai's voice actresses are public.\n\nSince the introduction of multiple Kizuna AIs, the original voice has reduced\nher appearances. Additionally, the third Kizuna Ai's voice has been appearing\nin commercials instead, such as in Santen's\n[commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfr8dyJUbk) from July 30. This\nhas given rise to fan speculation that Kizuna Ai's original voice will be\n\"phased out,\" although no official plans have been announced. A.I.Channel on\nbilibili released an official\n[statement](https://t.bilibili.com/h5/dynamic/detail/285220523205832760?tab=1)\non August 8 saying that videos on the channel are recorded, edited, and\nscheduled in advance, but did not directly address the future plans for Kizuna\nAi's original voice.\n\n_[Via[r/VirtualYouTubers](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/co22i0/full_timeline_of_multiple_ai_project/)\n(u/Harmonyano), [Medium](https://medium.com/@zenglin12345/the-posters-with-\ncentralized-information-about-the-original-kizuna-ai-a56fcdf95d2c) (Lin Ceng),\n[@Miracle_XYZ](https://twitter.com/Miracle_XYZ/status/1158788735602872320)]_\n\n* * *\n\n[discuss this in the forum (6 posts)](/cms/discuss/149993) |\n\nbookmark/share with:  ![](//cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/images/system/bookmark-\nshorturl.png)\n\n[Interest homepage](/interest/) / [archives](/interest/archive)\n\n[ ![](//cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/images/s/93/11338.ann-search-new_rev.gif)\nRightStuf - Anime, Manga and More ](/sponsor/click.php/11338)\n\n\u2b08\n\n\u2b0b\n\n-\n\n+\n\nep. review\n\n[220 comments](/cms/discuss/158385)\n\n[](/review/fruits-basket/episode-26/.158385)\n\n###  [Season Premiere: Fruits Basket \u2012 Episode 26](/review/fruits-\nbasket/episode-26/.158385)\n\nApr 8, 04:36\n\n[220 comments](/cms/discuss/158385)\n\nanime\n\nReturning champion Jacob Chapman is back to review the rollercoaster new\nseason of one of the biggest shojo dramas ever - how does the premiere hold\nup?\n\ncolumn\n\n[2 comments](/cms/discuss/158348)\n\n[](/this-week-in-anime/2020-04-07/.158348)\n\n###  [This Week in Anime - Things Get Awkward in the Idol Romcom\nOshibudo](/this-week-in-anime/2020-04-07/.158348)\n\nApr 8, 02:00\n\n[2 comments](/cms/discuss/158348)\n\nanime\n\nEripiyo is a one-woman fanclub for underground idol Maina from the group\nChamJam.

Paybac examines his complex relationships with the elements of\nhis 'Nigerian' life [Album Review]\n\n[ Motolani Alake ](https://www.pulse.ng/authors/motolani-alake)\n\n03/30/2020\n\nTell your friends [](javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Facebook\")\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Twitter\")\n[](mailto:?body=www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/paybac-cult-album-\nreview/exwgn0w \"Email\")\n\n**For his fourth body of work in just two years, **Paybac** uses the symbolic\nrepresentation of life as a totem to address inter-relationships in his life\nand the larger Nigerian society.  \n**\n\nPaybac releases new album, 'Cult!' (Instagram/LookAtPaybac)\n\n# In the modern Nigerian society, 'Cult' is of a negative connotation. That's\nwhat your parents call you when you grow a beard, pierce your ears and tint\nyour hair as a Nigerian teenager. It's what members of the infamous Special\nAnti-Robbery Squad (SARS) pretend you are to extort you.\n\nOn another point of negativity that doesn't relate to (victim) profiling,\ncultism is one of the biggest problems ravaging Nigerian youth. In other forms\nof cabalism, it is also one of the greatest impediments Nigeria faces on its\nway to growth and improvement. On March 27, 2020, Nigerian rapper, **Paybac**\ntitled his sophomore album the dreaded word, **CULT!** \\- yes, he added an\nexclamation mark.\n\nNo, he's not a cultist. For his fourth body of work in just two years,\n**Paybac** uses the symbolic representation of life as a totem to address\ninter-relationships in his life and the larger Nigerian society.\n\nOn it, he uses historical materials, political metaphors and pop culture\nreferences to describe even his complex relationships with elements of his\nlife.\n\nTo **Paybac,** the Nigerian polity is one whole machinery oiled by the warm-\nblooded organisms that make it up. Thus, one arm of the polity relates to\nanother. In that sense, the problems ravaging ordinary personal relationships\n(on _'Boy Band_ ') in lack of trust grows to plant seeds of corruption that\naffects the entire country (on ' _F*** A Politician_ ,' for example).\n\nTo all the songs, there is an interlink to which the bottomline relates to how\nNigeria creates a faulty legacy from its inability to maintain core values of\npositivity. There are also times which **Paybac** uses politician figures, pop\nculture references or quotes to reject how people negatively perceive him.\n\nTo me, the album is basically saying, if you cannot maintain a friendship or\npursue a girl honestly, how will you not grow to become a societal menace? How\nwill you trample upon positive legacies of people like **Aguiyi Ironsi?**\nWhile the foregoing is an afterthought, the album could also be simply\nperceived as the diary of an average wide-eyed Nigerian millennial living life\nin Nigeria.\n\nLike this review, the album could sometimes be wildly opinionated in its quest\nto safeguard the legacy of some, successfully interprete the roles of certain\nsocietal elements and criticize the existence of certain societal elements.\nIt's also quite interesting that this socio-politically charged album comes in\nthe thick of Nigerian complacency in the face of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, at the root of the album and to my digestion of it is the idea that\nto everything we do, there is a legacy. What our legacy is will usually depend\non how we live and sometimes, our legacy remains at the mercy of others to\ninterprete. **CULT!** itself is an album that's open to opinions and sometimes\nseems an _ad hominem_.\n\nNonetheless, the execution of it and those aforementioned elements of its\ncreativity makes the album top quality. In fact, this is the best body of work\n**Paybac** has ever released. If **The Biggest Tree** had better mixing,\noverall artistic execution like on **CULT!** and better production, it might\nrival **CULT!** but it doesn't.\n\n**Paybac** took his time to work on something that will stand the test of\ntime. While speaking with a legendary Nigerian journalist, he noted that, \"\n_This is the kind of artist Nigerians can invest in. He has the ability to\ngarner a cult following. If he has just N2 million to support this work with\nvideos, he could be on to something.\"_\n\nIt's the truth. This album is solid.\n\n## Here is why;\n\n' _Aguiyi Ironsi (Through The Mud)'_ opens **CULT!** to a classic reference -\na criticism of the African tendency to suffer and smile. That was **Fela** who\nnoted that, \" _People don't have to smile in a bad partnership...\"_ It's a\nmanifesto for the heavy socio-political themes on **CULT!** By delivery,\n**Paybac** is both himself and the roving spirit of **Aguiyi Ironsi.**\n\nThe legacy of **Aguiyi Ironsi** is a delicate and wrongly represented one.\nNigerians lump him up with the rest of the corrupt politicians. While he might\nnot have been clean, he is unfairly portrayed. History shows that **Aguiyi\nIronsi** was a good man - a lone/omega wolf - who existed in the time of\nvicious alpha wolves and he got consumed in the holocaust that kills also\nthose wolves.\n\nThere is also the tale that **Aguiyi Ironsi** was metaphysically fortified.\nThe story goes that when he died, he had to be dragged through the mud and\nkilled brutally because guns and machetes didn't work.\n\nThus, he struggles to set himself apart from the faulty legacy of the others.\nFor **Paybac,** he finds parallels between himself and **Ironsi.** To him,\nboth of them are wrongly perceived and portrayed. Both of them have also been\ndragged through the mud. The three moving parts of this song - Ironsi, Paybac\nand Fela's opinion - are tied by Paybac's refusal to be wrongly portrayed.\n\nInstead of getting kept down, **Paybac** comes back throwing punches. Instead\nof keeping quiet as he had been forced to, he swings at the Nigerian\npoliticians who have no passion for the job. Instead of being like the people\nFela criticized for suffering and smiling, **Paybac** refuses to smile. This\nsong sees **Paybac** try to rewrite his own legacy by changing his perception\n- unlike **Aguiyi Ironsi.**\n\nIts beat sounds like a **B.O.B** loosie - guitar-heavy with layers of eerie\nstrings. Those ominous strings also point to the entire direction of this\nalbum - little positivity and significant highlight reels of the negative\nNigerian society.\n\n_'Boy Band_ ' was the lead single for **CULT!** and it was released in 2019.\nAgain, it opens up to a **Chinua Achebe** quote, \" _Being Nigerian is\nabysmally frustrating and unbelievably exciting...\"_ From the perspective of\nboth a rapper and Nigerian in Nigeria, **Paybac** highlights the power of his\npersonal relationships and the lack of respect he gets from people.\n\nTo him, he makes music to be respected. Again, back to the title, ' _Boy Band_\n' and 'CULT!' are built on the concept of togetherness. While they can both be\nnegative; one has a usually positive connotation while the latter is\ninherently negative.\n\nThis time, **Paybac** finds the power of togetherness in his ' _Boy Band_ ' -\nhis gang, and his fans. The song then examines **Paybac** 's relationship with\nhis fans and supporters. That beat is also interesting - built on classic\nSouth-South Nigerian folk, it's defined by its trap percussion.\n\n_'Glamour Girls'_ featuring **Jazzz Attah** also highlights an inter-personal\nrelationship. But this time, it's not overly to societal or political.\nInstead, it celebrates a girl named **Blessing** who lives in Surulere, Lagos.\nThe song finds links to the **Kenneth Nnebue** classic, **Glamour Girls.** The\nfilm which highlights the lifestyle of a few 'high class' Lagos girls in the\nrisque life of transactional relationships.\n\nIt stars **Eucharia Anunobi, Zack Orji, Liz Benson, Dolly Unachukwu, Ernest\nObi, Ngozi Ezeonu, Gloria Anozie, Pat Attah** and **Sandra Achums.** The movie\npropelled the beautiful women in its cast into diva and sex symbol status that\nteenage boys obsessed over. On **Glamour Girls** , **Paybac** likens\n**Blessing** to **Liz Benson,** a star of the **Glamour Girls** franchise.\n\n_'Nigeria Suk My D*k'_ is the _'Mood For Eva'_ of most Nigerian millennials.\nThis one describes **Paybac** 's rocky relationship with his country. The\nphone conversation that opens the song and Paybac's cold shoulder underline\nthe frustration with which he breathes as a Nigerian. The beat is a minimalist\nalternative trap that cooks up sharp piano chords.\n\n_'F*k a Politician_ ' comes just one day after Nigerians quoted news that\n**Bola Ahmed Tinubu** donated N200 million to Lagos State for the fight\nagainst COVID-19 with, _'He transferred money from himself to himself_.' The\nrocky relationship between Nigerian politicians and electorate is secured by\nmutual contempt - sometimes subconscious.\n\nHere, **Paybac** brings it to the fore. Again, centred on relationship,\n**Paybac** describes his relationship with Nigerian politicians. It's not\nquite unexpected as **Paybac** belts out \" _F*k a Politician\"_ while the trap\nsong rumbles with the intensity of **King Kong.** Something also makes me\nthink this song was recorded before **Buhari** won his second-term in office.\n\n**Paybac** raps, \" _Chairman talking second term, but he's already dying...\"_\nThis album has been in the works for a long time.\n\n_'Lupita'_ features **Barelyanyhook** and its this writer's favourite song on\n**CULT!** The song and its themes - not as much its BPM - reminds this writer\nof ' _Seeds of Faith,'_ off **Paybac** 's debut album, **The Biggest Tree.**\nOn it, **Paybac** describes his relationship with the elements of the Nigerian\nsociety that concern him and how those things drove him to depression.\n\nTo highlight that, a part of the hook reads, \" _Young Naija n***a, I been\nrocking she'll toes I got 3 stripes that's Adidas...\"_\n\n**Lupita Nyong'o** is the Oscar-winning Kenyan actor who is a star of\nHollywood. Often, she is used as the standard of African beauty while she's\nalso subject to the hypocrisy of black appreciation across American media. On\nthis song, **Paybac** ties into that idea of hypocrisy and the attraction of\nsuccess as he proclaims himself a \" _Black star like Lupita.._.\"\n\nThe beat itself feels like a **Noah '40' Shebib** emo/R&B beat. Oh and,\n**Barelyanyhook** ate this beat up. His technique as he discusses a short\nversion of discovering his talent at 17 to hitting trials in 2017 is gripping.\nWhat a song to highlight one's perilous relationship with society.\n\n_'Afroskanking_ ' is such a monster boom bap production that borrows from\nafrobeats elements. I might be wrong, but I think the **Ngozi Chimamanda-\nAdichie** cut at the end of _'Lupita_ ' is material to this song. On that\nsample, **Adichie** tells a French person that people in Africa consume her\nbooks. Thereby, she asserts her blackness that's often doubted.\n\nIn similar fashion, **Paybac** uses ' _Afroskanking'_ to assert and endorse -\nhis relationship with his - blackness. He's boisterous and bullish about his\noptimism for success.\n\n_'Nana's Interlude_ ' is a boom bap beat that premised on guitar chords of a\n70's rock song. **Paybac** uses the song to highlight his relationship to what\nseems a West African woman. He asserts his love for her. While the song is\ntouching, **CULT!** could have done without it.\n\n_'Masquerade'_ is a bop, but in the overall spirit of **CULT!** it sticks out\neven worse than ' _Nana's Interlude.'_ The project could have done without it\nand its vanity is subtly wrongly placed.\n\n_'Waterside'_ features **Blaqbonez** and it's an ode to love. Built on a\nsample of what seems cut from a classic folk song by **Oliver De Coque** or\n**Victor Uwaifo,** Paybac highlights his relationship to a faceless and\nnameless woman and tells her to meet him at the waterside. **Blaqbonez** is\nthe perfect rapper for this as they both 'wash' their respective 'women.'\n\n_'A Tree Grew In Lagos_ ' is **Paybac** 's ode to (his relationship) with\nLagos and his perspective of getting made through the pressures of Lagos.\nPaybac is the tree that embraces the struggle and grew in Lagos through the\nwarped out strings merge with the legato strings. This song also points back\nto the title of **Paybac** 's debut album, **The Biggest Tree** \\- a diary of\nmental health struggles and personal struggles.\n\nThis time, **Paybac** is once again a tree. While on **The Biggest Tree,** he\nwas the tree ruminating through life, he ruminates through Lagos on ' _The\nTree Grew In Lagos.'_\n\n_'Devil In The Detail'_ documents **Paybac** 's love-hate relationship with\nmeticulousness and finicky concepts. Here, he speaks it through the female\nobsession for detail in make-up. That beat switch on 01:04 is amazing - what a\nlegato string. ' _Money In All My Pockets'_ examines **Paybac** 's\nrelationship with money.\n\nOn the one hand, the song is **Paybac** 's dreams of a ideal life. On the\nother hand, he also discusses the perils of chasing money blindly.\nNonetheless, the hook suggests that Paybac just wants the money and doesn't\ncare about the cliche that ' _Money doesn't buy happiness.'_\n\n_'Nigerian Dream'_ opens up to **Cardi B** 's viral comments that liken\nNigeria to **Disneyland.** She then urges people to also visit Nigeria. In\nthis social media era, The _'Nigerian Dream_ ' is traveling to a western\ncolony and tweeting your love for Nigeria from that colony - but that was\nbefore coronavirus. _oops._\n\nHere, **Paybac** 's ' _Nigerian Dream_ ' is heavily informed by the subject of\nabject leadership and corruption the Nigeria is embroiled in. The strife has\ninformed **Paybac** 's ' _Nigerian Dream_ ' to fulfill his vanity just one\ntime on the streets of Lagos; visit clubs and be a spendthrift in an opulent\nlifestyle. All these opulence will be funded by one thing; the famous\n'government money' or corruption or embezzlement or 'National chin-chin.'\n\n**Paybac** 's idea of the ' _Nigerian Dream'_ can then be defined as having\naccess to the corridors of political power from where one can create a legacy\nof corruption by putting one's family members in major offices. That first\nverse is amazing. And then, that **Viveeyan** doesn't just sound like\n**Beyonce,** she is probably Beyonce's 'offspring' of some kind.\n\nShe doesn't just sing like Beyonce, she has the same voice type - mezzo\nsoprano - with the same expansive vocal range and octaves. She also carries\nthat peculiar Beyonce ability to be vocally dramatic and pronounce words with\naggressive emotion in a bid to enforce lyrics and get you invested. No, it\ndoesn't stop there, she also has a Houston, Texas accent. Well, this isn't\nweird at all.\n\nIf someone tells me **Viveeyan** also has 13 octaves, I'm calling **Shawn\nCorey Carter.** The song is picture-esque perfection as **Paybac** and\n**Viveeyan** describe peculiar situations of the artist son of a corrupt\npolitician, calling the name of God through embezzlement, cheating while\ngetting called, 'sharp' and more.\n\n' _Activ8_ ' was a single released pre-release of **CULT!** To be honest, I\nthink ' _Activ8_ ' should have been the album opener. 'Nigerian Dream' would\nhave been fantastic as an outro. Nonetheless, ' _Activ8_ ' is topically\nexpansive as it houses **Paybac** 's relationship with his dreams.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nFirst off, this is an amazing body of work that is near-flawless. It's also\namazing that **Paybac** carries 15 tracks on his back with only two songs\nseeming out of place. While that takes some marks off **Paybac** and his\nexecution of this project, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme.\nPaybac has done something special as a rapper and as an A&R.\n\nHe should also look into being A&R for other artists. He hand-picked his\nfeatures to perfection - they were all brilliant without overshadowing him\n**.** It's also credit to **Paybac** that it never seemed like his features\ncarried him at any point. Nonetheless, **Barelyanyhook** stands out. That\nalbum art is also ridiculous.\n\nEven though its symbolism seems too mired in excessive conceptualism, its\naesthetic is something to behold.\n\nWhat **Paybac** needs now is a budget for videos. This guy is not slowing down\nanytime soon. Chances are his next project will be even better. But with all\nthemes examined, one thing this album puts forward to me as a listener is a\nquestion, 'As a Nigerian millennial living in Nigeria, what do you want to\nbe?' I guess the answer is left to me and to the people who are watching me.\n\n**Ratings: /10**\n\n\u2022 0-1.9: Flop\n\n\u2022 2.0-3.9: Near fall\n\n\u2022 4.0-5.9: Average\n\n\u2022 6.0-7.9: Victory\n\n\u2022 8.0-10: Champion\n\n**Pulse Rating: /10**\n\nTracklist and Tracklisting: 1.8/2\n\nContent and Themes: 2/2\n\nProduction: 1.8/2\n\nEnjoyability and Satisfaction: 1.6/2\n\nExecution: 1.6/2\n\n**Total:**\n\n**8.8 - Champion**\n\nSource:  Pulse Nigeria\n\n[ #PAYBAC ](/paybac \"Paybac\") [ #CULT ](/cult \"Cult\") [ #ALBUM REVIEW\n](/album-review \"Album Review\") [ #BLAQBONEZ ](/blaqbonez \"blaqbonez\")\n\n![Motolani Alake](//ocdn.eu/pulscms-\ntransforms/1/IkkktkpTURBXy9kMThiMDZlM2M3MTg2NDAyZGIxNDM3YjIyOGRlYzYwNi5qcGeTlQMAAM0JmM0MkJUCAGTDw5MFZGQ)\n\n[ Motolani Alake ](https://www.pulse.ng/authors/motolani-alake) [More from the\nauthor \u00bb](https://www.pulse.ng/authors/motolani-alake)\n\nTell your friends [](javascript:void\\(0\\);) [](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n[](mailto:?body=www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/paybac-cult-album-\nreview/exwgn0w)\n\n<https://www.facebook.com/policies>\n\n  \n\nJoin the \"sabi\"  clique\n\nDon't miss a thing , get the latest updates to fuel your conversation daily\n\n  \n  \n\nBy clicking again you agree to our [ Privacy Policy\n](https://www.pulse.ng/info/privacy-policy-how-we-respect-your-privacy-or-\npulseng/k6400dg) and European users agree to data transfer policy\n\n  \nSEND ME UPDATES  YES SEND ME UPDATES\n\nThank you!

[\n](/my/account/emailthispage/) __ 1 comment __\n\nA kickboxing group in Woolwich are in 'desperate need of donations' to\ncontinue funding a much-loved community initiative.\n\nNo Limits Active8 Community holds free kickboxing classes at Woolwich\ncommunity centre to help keep young people off the streets and out of trouble.\n\nQualified coaches Scott Yuill and Trevor Clarke volunteer to hold the classes\nin their spare time.\n\nIn the past year, they've seen their classes have a successful intake of over\n300 people of all ages.\n\nBack in November 2018, the coaches were offered the hall space for a year free\nof charge.\n\nBut now, a year later, the classes are at risk, with costs between \u00a313 to \u00a320\nnow applying to the hall hire.\n\nCoach Scott Yuill said: \"We started a JustGiving page to try to cover the\ncosts of the hall because we firmly believe in the benefits of our classes.\n\n\"A lot of these people can't afford to pay and to have these classes stop\nwould definitely have an impact on them and their social health.\"\n\nThe money raised will also go towards new training equipment and potentially\nallow the team to branch out to other areas.\n\nThere are currently six other coaches who help with teaching.\n\nThe page has raised \u00a360 out of the targeted \u00a34,200 at the time of publishing.\n\nA supporter on their donation page said, \"You guys do so much for our local\nkids some who wouldn't have much to look forward to without your classes.\"\n\nIf you would like to find out more or donate

](/my/account/emailthispage/)\n__ 1 comment __\n\nA community fire walk has raised over \u00a35,000 for the Greenwich and\n[Bexley](/news/bexley/) Community Hospice, including volunteers from a local\nyouth project in support of a member with cerebral palsy.\n\nA team of 10 took part in the Fire Walk for Frankie and the Hospice, organised\nby local youth project No Limits Activ8 Community.\n\nThe idea for the fundraiser came about when one of the youth group's members,\n16-year-old Frankie Yuill, applied to do a sponsored fire walk to raise \u00a3100\nfor the Hospice.\n\nFrankie, who has cerebral palsy, was told the safety conditions had changed,\nrequiring all participants to be at least 18. In response, several of\nFrankie's friends decided to apply to join the fire walk in support of\nFrankie, and the youth project managed to put forward 10 volunteers.\n\nAfter a motivational 'masterclass' course, the participants walked barefoot\nover the hot coals. So far, Frankie's team has raised \u00a31,225 on their\nfundraising page, 245% of their original target.\n\nThe Hospice said 32 walkers took part in the event in total, raising a massive\n\u00a35,000.\n\nOne of the fire walkers, Suzanne Carver, said: \"Doing this as part of the team\nwas amazing, and to know we were helping such a worthy cause made it even more\nspecial.\"\n\nAnother participant, Samantha Joseph Granger, added: \"Doing the fire walk\nmeant a lot to me, as this charity is amazing. I suffer from anxiety so to be\nable to do the fire walk felt amazing, and it was even better being part of\nthe No limits Activ8 Community team.\"\n\nThe No Limits Activ8 Community group provide free kick boxing and fitness\nclasses to young people in and around Woolwich, aiming to take them off the\nstreets, away from criminal influences and instead involved in sport.\n\nDespite his cerebral palsy, a representative from No Limits said this has\nnever held Frankie back as he holds his own boxing tutors certificate and\nhelps run some of the free classes.\n\nAmanda Tolley, the challenger events fundraiser who organised the event on\nbehalf of the [Greenwich](/news/greenwich/) and Bexley Community Hospice, said\nmeeting Frankie was \"the highlight of my evening, and was a very emotional\nmoment of a lot of people.\"\n\nShe added: \"They are a lovely bunch of young people, and I found Scott his Dad\nvery inspirational in what he has done for the young people in his community.\n\n\"The whole event was a success, and as a Hospice we raised over \u00a35k! We are so\ngrateful to everyone who took part, and all the money raised helps us provide\nthe care that we do.\n\nThe Just Giving page for the No Limits Activ8 Community event is still active,\nso if you'd like to donate to the hospice, follow this link:\n<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/nolimitsactiv8community>\n\n[\n](whatsapp://send?text=Fundraising%20fire%20walk%20raises%20over%20%C2%A35%2C000%20for%20local%20Hospice%0A%0Ahttps://www.newsshopper.co.uk%2Fnews%2F18006986.fundraising-\nfire-walk-raises-5-000-greenwich-bexley-community-hospice%2F%3fref%3Dwa) [\n](fb-\nmessenger://share/?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsshopper.co.uk/news/18006986.fundraising-\nfire-walk-raises-5-000-greenwich-bexley-community-\nhospice/%3fref%3Dfbm&app_id=156974431023127) [ ](/my/account/emailthispage/)\n__ 1 comment __\n\nOrder by Oldest first Newest first Highest scored Lowest scored\n\nLoading comments...\n\n__ __ Suspend\n\nLast Updated:\n\nReply Quote\n\nEdit Delete Report\n\n![Replying](/resources/static/nile/img/bg-reply-right.png)\n\n> ****wrote:  \n>\n\nPost reply\n\nSave comment Cancel\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nYes, delete the comment No, keep the comment\n\n### Report This Comment\n\nReport comment\n\n  * Most read\n  * Commented\n\nLoading...\n\n  1. ![]()\n\n  2. \n\nRead more __\n\n  1. ![]()\n\n__\n\nGet involved with the news in your community\n\n[Send your stories and photos now](/send-us-your-news)\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n[ ](/news/18366060.new-system-boarding-london-buses-introduced-protect-\ndrivers-covid-19/)\n\n[\n\n## New system of boarding London buses introduced to protect drivers from\nCovid-19\n\n](/news/18366060.new-system-boarding-london-buses-introduced-protect-drivers-\ncovid-19/)\n\n[__2](/news/18366060.new-system-boarding-london-buses-introduced-protect-\ndrivers-covid-19/#comments-anchor \"Read comments\")\n\n[ ](/news/18364832.lewisham-greenwich-nhs-trust-appeals-covid-19-donations-\nsupport-heroic-staff/)\n\n[\n\n## Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust appeals for Covid-19 donations to support\nheroic staff\n\n](/news/18364832.lewisham-greenwich-nhs-trust-appeals-covid-19-donations-\nsupport-heroic-staff/)\n\n[ ](/news/18366402.sainsburys-lifts-coronavirus-rationing-measures/)\n\n[\n\n## Sainsbury's is first to lift rationing measures by stopping three-item\nlimit\n\n](/news/18366402.sainsburys-lifts-coronavirus-rationing-measures/)\n\n[ ](/news/18366366.coronavirus-without-symptoms/)\n\n[\n\n## Could you have coronavirus without any symptoms?

Prospective participants can\ncontact activ8hockey@thenourishedathete.com.au for more information.\n\n* * *\n\n**Posted In:**\n\n  * [Post to

SSE Airtricity.\n\nIrish utility SSE Airtricity has acquired a 40% stake in Activ8 Solar\nEnergies, one of Ireland's leading rooftop solar installers.\n\nSSE Airtricity has also retained the option to acquire a further 10%\nshareholding after two years.\n\nThe deal, which is subject to approval by Ireland's Competition and Consumer\nProtection Commission, will see Activ8's existing management team continue to\nlead the firm.\n\nSSE Airtricity expects to complete the purchase in the coming months.\n\nThe utility's timing is particularly opportune considering that in February\nthis year Ireland's climate minister Denis Naughten revealed the country is to\n[pilot a domestic, grant-aided microgeneration support\nscheme](https://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/ireland_to_pilot_microgeneration_support_for_solar_homes)\noutside of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme.\n\nCarrickmacross-based Activ8 has installed more than 7,000 solar systems\nthroughout the island of Ireland, perhaps most notably a 420kWp system atop\nthe SSE Arena in Belfast which was completed last year.\n\nIt has also been one of SSE Airtricity Energy Services' preferred partners for\nSEAI-supported domestic and community-based retrofit solar schemes since 2016.\n\nStephen Gallagher, director of business energy at SSE

24th birthday party, she had a\nmeltdown. She didn\u2019t like what she saw.\n\nThe Omaha woman found a personal trainer at Activ8 Fitness, 132nd and F\nStreets. She walked in ready to make a complete lifestyle change.\n\nReeker said she started \u201cfrom ground zero.\u201d She could barely do a squat, and\nstarted out lifting with 3-pound weights.\n\nShe got over her fear of being judged in the gym and joined group classes. She\nand her classmates hold each other accountable.\n\nAlong with the new exercise routine, Reeker overhauled her diet. She started\ntracking everything she ate in a day. It also meant cutting out pop and fast\nfood.\n\nReeker started at 217 pounds. Now she\u2019s down to 139 pounds and is working on\nmaintaining her nearly 80-pound weight loss.\n\nShe has found a happy balance in maintaining her diet and exercise routines.\nShe still goes out to eat with family and friends, and she doesn\u2019t turn down\ncake at a birthday celebration. She knows how to get back on track the next\nday.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s not so much losing weight. This is for my mental health,\u201d said\nReeker, who\u2019s now 25. \u201cIt\u2019s such a relaxing place, and it\u2019s where I crave to\nbe, especially after a hard workday.\u201d\n\n#### **Sign up for the Live Well Nebraska newsletter**\n\nGet the latest health headlines and inspiring stories straight to your inbox.\n\n**Q: When did you start working out and why?**\n\n **A:** I started in May 2018. On my 24th birthday, I took pictures and had a\nhuge golden birthday celebration. I just didn\u2019t like who I was in those\npictures. I wanted to make a change.\n\n **Q: Describe your workouts. How many days per week do you exercise?**\n\n **A:** When I started, I did a lot of personal training. I eventually got to\na point where I was comfortable working out around other people. Now I walk in\nfeeling like I\u2019m part of their family. There\u2019s a lot of high-intensity\ninterval training and weightlifting. Every day is different. I\u2019m there five to\nsix days a week.\n\n **Q: What is your current fitness goal?**\n\n **A:** Continuing where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m at a really good place. I\u2019ve lost 75\npounds, and I\u2019m maintaining. I\u2019ve gotten to a point where the scale doesn\u2019t\nmean anything to me anymore. I feel so comfortable in my own skin. I\u2019m so\nproud of myself. I worked really, really hard. There is no magic pill. It was\na complete lifestyle change.\n\n**Q: What has been your biggest accomplishment?**\n\n **A:** How I view myself. I was very hard on myself, and I beat myself up\nwhen I saw pictures. At the beginning of the journey, it was hard not to see\nthat scale move. But I took weekly pictures, and they were the biggest thing,\nbecause I\u2019ve seen my body change. I changed my physical appearance, but also a\nlot mentally and emotionally.\n\n **Q: What has been the toughest hurdle and how did you overcome it?**\n\n **A:** Saying no in that beginning process. I had to say no to going out on\nweekends or to doing pizza night once a week. That was hard, but I learned not\nto make food so much of a priority at gatherings. Some people didn\u2019t get it,\nbut this was a \u201cme\u201d thing. It was changing for me and no one else.\n\n **Q: What helps you stay on track?**\n\n **A:** Christa Gilson and Brent Dierking have been the greatest people. They\nhave changed my life. And the friends I\u2019ve made. These girls text me on my bad\ndays when I don\u2019t want to go to the gym, and I text them encouragement. I\ncouldn\u2019t do it without the support and accountability.\n\n **Q: What is your gym pet peeve?**\n\n **A:** Not putting your weights away.\n\n **Q: What do you do when you aren\u2019t in the gym?**\n\n **A:** I work a lot and I spend a lot of time with friends and family. The\ngym has been my life, but I love it. I love being active and being outdoors.\n\n **Q: What is the piece of equipment, supplement, clothing, etc. that you\ncan\u2019t live without?**\n\n **A:** Wearing a tank top is now my favorite thing ever. When I first\nstarted, I went to the gym in full-length leggings and a T-shirt. I also love\na kettlebell workout.\n\n **Q: What advice would you give to someone who is just starting their fitness\njourney?**\n\n **A:** Don\u2019t be scared. That scale does not define where you\u2019re at. You\u2019ve\ngot to take a hard look in the mirror and realize that if you\u2019re putting in\nthe work and trying, you\u2019re doing the best you can and it will come in time.\nEveryone has different goals. You can\u2019t compare someone else\u2019s story to your\nown.\n\nClose\n\n1 of 17\n\n__\n\n![Fighting for a heart transplant, Omaha man drops 140 pounds in one year and\nquits\nsmoking](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/18/0180b66b-ca8b-554b-b156-9ad6df7b7b85/5c250b7d39bba.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C830)\n\n__\n\nAfter Joe Adams had a heart attack, he underwent numerous procedures to get\nhis heart in working order.

through with some brand new, club-inspired\nmusic. The talented Canadian producer is about to drop his **_ACTIV8_** **EP**\ntomorrow, but we\u2019re pumped to give you an exclusive peek into the project with\na premiere of \u201c **Don\u2019t Tell The Bank**.\u201d While many know Shaun Frank for his\ncommercial leaning dance hits and remixes, this one is a straight-to-the-point\ndance floor cut that will certainly turn heads. We\u2019re loving this beat-driven\nstyle from Shaun.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s take a quick moment to appreciate Shaun Frank\u2019s comical vocal\nsample: \u201cMy credit\u2019s bad, but my money\u2019s good. Don\u2019t tell the bank.\u201d We love\nwhen producers don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and have a little fun with\ntheir art. This new single right here is simply that, a fun one.\n\nStream the brand new \u201cDon\u2019t Tell The Bank\u201d below and enjoy!\n\n### Shaun Frank - Don't Tell The Bank\n\n\ufeff\n\n###

At least Ciaran Marron, chief executive of Monaghan-based Activ8\nSolar Energies, believes it's a step in the right direction.\n\nMinister for the Environment Denis Naughten has just announced new grants\ntowards for the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and storage batteries\nmeaning that householders can get \u20ac700 per 1kWp panel, up to a total of \u20ac3,800\nwhile batteries will be subsidised to the tune of \u20ac1,000 per unit.\n\nThe idea is that this will help cut our greenhouse gas emissions and\ndecarbonise our electricity supply at the same time.\n\nNot to be confused with solar thermal panel technology which helps generate\nhot water, the excess electricity generated by the PV panels can feed into the\nnational grid.\n\n\"Solar PV allows both domestic and commercial users to save money on their\nenergy bills. Although it is the same technology, systems for domestic\ncustomers will differ to that of commercial users given the vast difference in\nenergy requirements,\" Marron told the Sunday Independent.\n\nHe added that customer bills will drop as a result of the grants but the\nGovernment should expand the scheme to include the business community.\n\n\"On the domestic side, the Solar PV grant announced recently also included a\n\u20ac1,000 grant for battery storage technology. Although domestic customers can\nsave up to 60pc on their bills without battery storage, incorporating such\nwill allow customers to use more of the energy they produce.\n\n\"Commercial customers will generally have much bigger systems and battery\nstorage isn't as important considering that in most cases, energy production\nis at its highest when the demand for it is there to match during daylight\nhours. Whether domestic or commercial, I think everyone is going to see many\nmore rooftops covered in solar PV panels. It is a move in the right direction\nbut there is scope for the commercial sector too - I think we will see PV\npanels on the roofs of businesses too in the future.\"\n\nHowever, he conceded that the recently announced incentives will be too late\nfor our targets to cut carbon emissions by 2020.\n\n\"Here in Ireland we were hesitant and the fear of getting it wrong crippled us\ninto inaction. Although we may have been slow adaptors, it afforded the powers\nto be the opportunity to learn from other EU countries' mistakes and use their\nschemes as a case study.\n\n\"One other reason is that it's not the case that all renewables have been\nignored. We see it across the Irish landscape, with large focus on wind energy\nproduction. Luckily, the Government and others now know that solar PV\nexcellently complements our existing wind infrastructure. So I think there has\nbeen a multitude of reasons for our slow approach towards solar, but as of\nright now, it's an exciting industry to in. Although we are well behind the\nrest of Europe,\" he said.\n\nIndeed we are.\n\nIreland is completely off course to achieve its 2020 and 2030 climate change\ntargets, according to the recently published Climate Change Advisory Council's\nAnnual Review 2018.\n\nFollowing last year's annual review, Ireland is now in an even worse position.\nIreland's greenhouse gas emissions increased again in 2016, with the\nprojections of emissions to 2035 showing that we are well behind when it comes\nto addressing the challenge of climate change.\n\nIt should be no surprise then that Ireland is ranked as the second-worst\nperforming EU member state in tackling climate change, according to Climate\nAction Network (CAN) which is the biggest NGO coalition in Europe working on\nenergy issues and climate.\n\nWhile the 2018 Off Target report concluded that all EU member states are\nfalling short of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change efforts to limit global\ntemperature gains to 1.5 degrees, most of CAN's criticism was reserved for\nthis country and those in eastern and central Europe and it warned that we\nface \"annual non-compliance costs of around \u20ac500m\".\n\nIt also highlighted that emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors\nare increasing significantly.\n\nThe farming and business sectors, for example, is a huge growth opportunity\nfor the company said Marron and should be targeted as part of the Government's\nrenewable energy programme.\n\n\"The UK has previously incentivised rooftop solar with a feed-in tariff. I\nbelieve a very similar model for Irish commercial and agricultural customers\nwould be a perfect fit. This approach incentivises self-consumption and the\nposition we find ourselves in regarding our lower carbon targets points\ntowards a self-consumption model.\n\n\"Getting the balance between creating a meaningful commercial incentive that\nencourages self-consumption is something that would go a long way in helping\nbusinesses adopt and buy into renewable energy,\" he added.\n\n\"It's the same as any industry, lessons were learned in the UK and we were\nlucky to be a part of that. We set up a business in Newry in 2012 and we\nlearned a lot through that and the high standards of installation and service\nthat we have now brought to solar PV installation in Ireland,\" he said.\n\nThe structure of Activ8 changed earlier this year when SSE Airtricity came in\nas an investor.\n\nSSE acquired 40pc of Activ8 earlier this year and has an option to take an\nadditional stake over the next couple of years.\n\nThis investment (the amount has not been disclosed) brings big growth\nopportunities for the firm which is expecting to generate profits of about\n\u20ac450,000 on turnover of about \u20ac4.8m for 2017, according to Marron.\n\nAnd while the majority of the company's business remains solar thermal\ninstallations and stands at 70pc currently, Marron expects thermal and solar\nPV to hit parity at some stage in the next 12 months.\n\n\"Being the market leader in solar technology for the past eight years and now\npartnering with Ireland's largest provider of wind energy, Activ8 and SSE\nAirtricity will bring unique offerings to our domestic and commercial customer\nbase including SSE Airtricity's 750,000 energy supply customers across the\nisland of Ireland.\n\n\"It has allowed us to grow faster than we thought possible and while SSE\nAirtricity are able to lean on us for our knowledge of the Irish solar\nindustry it has also given us the opportunity to learn from them and tackle\nthe challenges we face together,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe following our partnership with SSE Airtricity and the recent grant\nannouncement for solar PV, Activ8 will increase our turnover by 50pc year on\nyear for the next three years. We're still in the early stages of our\npartnership with SSE Airtricity, so as time passes, our goals will change and\ntogether we'll be pushing the ceiling of the Irish solar industry higher and\nhigher,\" Marron added.\n\nThe company employs 45 staff and another 20 indirectly including agents,\nengineers and electricians - it has installed over 7,000 solar energy systems\nacross the island of Ireland.\n\nIts biggest project, to date, in partnership with SSE, was the installation of\na 1,448-panel rooftop cover for the 2,300 sq m SSE Arena in Belfast which\ngenerates 420kWp of solar energy.\n\nThe company started out in 2006, at the peak of the boom, as Ciaran Marron\nElectrical, specialising in total electrical and mechanical solutions which\nthen became Activ8 Energies Ltd.\n\nIt had grown to employ eight skilled professionals by 2008 but at that stage\nwas being hit by the recession and left unpaid by some contractors.\n\nMarron said it was either follow their fate or diversify - the company chose\nthe latter route.\n\nIt focused its capabilities on the solar thermal retrofit market and targeting\nand servicing the increasing number of homeowners keen to take control of\ntheir increasing energy bills and, by 2009, Activ8 had completed all legacy\ncontracts and focused solely on this market.\n\nFollowing an analysis of the solar thermal markets in the UK and Austria, we\ndeveloped a new business plan, added Marron.\n\n\"Through experience of training in Austria for solar thermal installations on\nnew builds and having seen the success of retrofitting solar thermal all\nacross Europe, we decided to focus on this as a business. With that, the\nattitudes of people had started to change also and with the recession at hand,\npeople wanted to focus on reducing costs and improving their current home\nrather than looking to build or move.\n\n\"Within 12 months of this decision, we became the largest solar installer in\nIreland and we continue to be. Hand in hand with that came the opportunity to\nenter the solar PV market in Northern Ireland with the subsidies that were\nintroduced,\" he said.\n\nThe business plan certainly seems to have worked.\n\n\"In fact, one of our main challenges now is finding skilled workers,\" he said.\n\nBrexit is the next big challenge, as is the case for all Irish businesses.\n\nHowever, Marron said that despite its location on the Border, because the\ncompany's main market is the Republic of Ireland it is somewhat buffered.\n\n\"Obviously the big thing about Brexit is the uncertainty and we do import some\nof our products from the UK. But we haven't had to worry about Brexit as much\nas some other Irish companies given that our target market is in the Republic\nof Ireland. Our partnerships with suppliers reach all around the world and\nwe're in the lucky position of being able to work with suppliers outside of\nthe UK who we already have a relationship with,\" he said.\n\nSunday Indo Business\n\n* * *\n\n##  Related Content\n\n[ __![&lsquo;When I walk out the front door of my workshop, the Bluestack\nMountains are right there.

boost when former Wales Rugby international Rupert Moon stopped by\non a visit to Wrexham to take a look at what goes on there.\n\nMr Hughes said: \"He was impressed with what he saw and he's the director of a\nconstruction company.\n\n\"He visited with the MD of the company and they saw some of the construction\nwork we wanted to do here and offered to help with it all.\n\n\"They were absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nMr Hughes, a Second Dan who has been a judo coach for 40 years, was a social\nworker before opening the gym 20 years ago, located next door to Ysgol Bro\nAlun, to help give everyone a purpose.\n\n[

[Greenock](/search/?search=Greenock&topic_id=9108).\n\nActive8 Our Place is an aspiring community funds project, aimed at helping\npeople living in the south west area of the town to help themselves.\n\nThree members of staff - Viv Hearton, Lee Trotter and Jim Watson - have been\nappointed to the run the initiative until the end of 2019.\n\nWillie Wilson, manager of [Branchton](/search/?search=Branchton&topic_id=9121)\nCommunity Centre where the team are based, is keen to stress that it is a\nproject for the whole of the south west.\n\nHe said: \"The idea is that it is a community development project for the\nGreenock south west area.\n\n\"We are asking 'what are your aspirations for the future of your community?'\n\n\"With a bit of support we can make your dreams come true.\n\n\"It's really what people in the community can do for themselves, what we can\ndo to help the community, not a list of things that they want done for them.\"\n\nProject leader Viv says she is 'really excited' about the project.\n\nShe told the Tele: \"There is also some funding attached to it to get things\nmoving.\n\n\"Part of the project is aimed at reducing social isolation, getting people out\nof their homes and accessing local resources such as community centre and\nhalls, lunch clubs, sharing food and community meals.\"\n\nLee, a project officer, said: \"I would love for everyone in the south west -\nfrom kids to pensioners - to get a voice from this, so they feel they are\nmaking an active contribution to their community.\n\n\"I am working with children at the moment and they are keeping me smiling a\nlot.\n\n\"They are the future of the community.\"\n\nTo launch the project a competition called Mad Sad and Glad has been launched,\nwith people asked to send in words, pictures or video to show what makes them\nfeel that way.\n\nWillie said: \"We will try to make something happen around that theme.\n\n\"There will also be a big community get-together where everyone in the area\nwill be invited for a brainstorming session.\"\n\nViv added: \"The project is about celebrating all the good things happening in\nthe area and creating a good community vibe.\"\n\nIf anyone wants to get in touch with the group or take part in the competition\nthey can visit Activ8 Our Place on Facebook or twitter.\n\nActiv8 Your Place is funded by the European Social Fund and the Scottish\nGovernment and several local organisations make up the steering group.\n\n====\n\nPictured are Jim, Viv and Lee.\n\n[\n](whatsapp://send?text=A%20pioneering%20%C2%A3178%2C000%20project%20has%20been%20launched%20in%20Greenock%0A%0Ahttps://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2F17264126.a-pioneering-178000-project-\nhas-been-launched-in-greenock%2F%3fref%3Dwa)

enthusiasm to learning on the job, the wholesale and retail\nentrepreneur sums up business lessons from growing a \u00a310m company\n\nby Stuart Conroy\n\nUpdated: Jan 29, 2019 Published: Aug 10, 2016\n\n![The Entrepreneur: Stuart Conroy, Activ8](https://startups.co.uk/wp-\ncontent/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![The Entrepreneur: Stuart\nConroy, Activ8](https://images.startups.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Stu-\nConroy-Activ8.jpg)\n\n**Founder:** Stuart Conroy  \n**Company:** Activ8  \n**Website:** <http://www.a8uk.com>  \n**Description in one line:** Accessories retailer for digital devices and a\nonline facilitator for starter brands  \n**Turnover:** \u00a310.6m (2015)  \n**12 month target:** \u00a313m\n\n### Business growth\n\n#### Describe your business model and what makes your business unique:\n\n  * Activ8 is a multi-channel business, bridging the gap between the manufacturing floor and end users.\n  * Our business structure not only looks at how the business should be run in the future, but the reality of how it can be run today.\n  * Its focus spans from manufacturing and global sourcing through to B2B and B2C.\n\n#### What is your greatest business achievement to date?\n\nBeing on _The Sunday Times_ Fast Track 100 of leading companies two years\nrunning would be the answer from an awards perspective,but really it was in\nchanging the way a manufacturing operation could work with a UK company.\n\nI created a separate model for distribution that puts more money into our\nmanufacturing partner from overall profits which kept them incentivised to\ndeliver continual quality and innovation.\n\n#### What numbers do you look at every day in your business?\n\nRevenue and profitability on a daily basis. I was a little na\u00efve of KPIs until\na couple of years ago; we are now engaging the team in a variety of indicators\nso we can create inclusivity within the company.\n\nWe were a little blind at the micro-level of our business beforehand and KPIs\nare one of those things you learn as you go along, especially if you haven\u2019t\nbeen to business school.\n\n#### To what extent does your business trade internationally and what are your\nplans?\n\nMost of our revenue is derived from overseas trade but we are buying in US\nDollars so the devaluation of the pound right now doesn\u2019t really help us,\nexcept for the stock we hold in the UK.\n\nWe have a good understanding of global online trading and we are working with\npartners to extend this element of the business. These days, you really have\nto have a global perspective on your products with a view to control of the\nsupply chain, continuity of brand etc.\n\n#### Describe your growth funding path:\n\nThe business was self-financed. In 2007 I remortgaged my house to seize the\nopportunity that we saw.\n\nWe have since invested funds in different ventures to grow the company while\nalso building a risk management structure that has brought breadth to the\ncompany rather than just focusing on revenue today.\n\n#### What technology has made the biggest difference to your business?\n\nApart from Excel (which is still the greatest invention for businesses ever!),\nwe have tried to use the latest technology wherever possible and not get\nbogged down in to some of the bigger solutions. It means we can move quickly\nif we need to.\n\nOne advantage a start-up has over its competitors is the use of latest\ntechnology, as more established companies can become tied down to older\nsystems.\n\nWe have recently moved from Magento to Shopify for a number of client projects\nbecause of the ease of transactions and the ability to use their POS solution\nin our iFix stores. I\u2019m not dismissing WordPress or Magento but for a roll-out\nof a project that needed POS solutions alongside e-commerce, Shopify is such a\nsimple and well thought out process.\n\n#### Where would you like your business to be in three years?\n\nOur sector moves so quickly so we want to be a key player in our industry and\nI see us being ambassadors for the smart device accessory market.\n\n### Growth challenges\n\n#### What is the hardest thing you have ever done in business?\n\nLetting people go. I was na\u00efve in thinking I could keep a team through growing\nthe business and the many changes that occur with that. We all talk of\nbuilding business cultures and it becomes difficult during the course of that\njourney to let people go that you felt were integral.\n\nWe are more grown up in how we look at this now but, if certain projects don\u2019t\nwork, letting go of staff is part of business.\n\n#### What was your biggest business mistake?\n\nIt\u2019s always a difficult one to answer; if you hadn\u2019t made mistakes you\nwouldn\u2019t have changed and grown personally or matured as a company. My biggest\nlesson learnt was trying to do too much too soon.\n\nWe tried to take on a few too many projects and in business you're always\nlearning from decisions like this. We had to go back and build more solid\nfoundations - my biggest challenge remains in curbing all of my enthusiasm\ninto more focused projects. I don\u2019t regret any of it as I don\u2019t want to look\nback thinking I shirked an opportunity or feared failure through trying to be\nbetter.\n\nTo learn that you must fail fast is usually derived from having failed slowly\nin the past.\n\n#### Piece of Red Tape that hampers growth most:\n\nHR to me seems to be the one that gets most business time. You want a fair\nsystem that is not detrimental to businesses investing in people and projects.\n\n#### What is the most common serious mistake you see entrepreneurs make?\n\nWorking too hard in the business. A friend of mine recently recommended the\n_E-Myth_ book by Michael Gerber and I wish I\u2019d read it years ago.\n\nIt offers a fantastic insight into why so many businesses fail, as the\nentrepreneur becomes bogged down in the business and ends up not doing the\nbits they enjoy which would ultimately bring the best success to the business.\n\nAside from that, I would say lack of planning in not making sure that there\nare clear goals and expectation to measure against. In a fast-growing\nbusiness, it is not always easy to look up so laying the foundations initially\nis basic but essential work.\n\n#### How will your market look in three years?\n\nWe have always looked to evolve with the market and whilst we see more\ncompetition in our space, continually we are using our skill-sets to help\nother market sectors.\n\nI like an environment that is new every day and we are always learning about\nnew technologies and ways of doing things but we\u2019re realistic that so many\nsectors are relatively short loved these days. We see the internet and\nassociated logistics as a longer term requirement rather than our products\nwithin it so we\u2019ll keep evolving.\n\n#### What is the single most important piece of advice you would offer to a\nless experienced entrepreneur?\n\nSet your targets for what you want the business to be. Plan for growth if that\nis the intention; knowing that key personnel you will need to be supported as\nthe business grows. Too many fail where the main person is the focus of\neverything and the business outgrows them.\n\nBe aware of the figures - too many businesses, particularly at the early stage\nof their lives, are not on top of their targets and goals.\n\n### Personal growth\n\n#### Biggest luxury:\n\nRunning my own business and having to only answer to me!\n\n#### Executive education or learn it on the job?\n\nI\u2019ve learnt everything on the job having been in banking IT previously.\nSometimes you just have to take the leap. Nobody likes to fail at something\nbut sometimes these failures are the greatest learning lessons.\n\n#### What would make you a better leader?\n\nDistancing myself from people and realising it is business. You want people to\nhave fun, learn and thrive in a working environment.\n\nI always wanted to be part of that as well but I think to have the respect of\nothers you need that distance.\n\n#### What one thing do you wish you\u2019d known when you started?\n\nBusiness itself. I wasn\u2019t that interested in business growing up as I wasn\u2019t\nfrom that type of background but you\u2019re never too old to start so I\u2019m focusing\nmore of my attention on learning the elements of running a business away from\nbeing in the business.\n\n#### One business app and one personal app you can\u2019t do without:\n\nBusiness: It would have to be 7Geese - it tracks objective key results through\nthe business and we\u2019ve already seen the benefits of providing transparency\nthrough all levels of the business!\n\nPersonal: My favourite personal app at the moment is SWORKIT for stretches and\nworkouts, although really you can\u2019t beat Hive for controlling your heating\nwhen the winter sets in.\n\n#### Business book:\n\n_The E-Myth_ by Michael Gerber. Loved reading it and could relate to so much\nof it (see the point about business mistakes above).\n\nComments\n\nAdd new comment  Leave a reply\n\n[Cancel Reply](/entrepreneur-stuart-conroy-activ8/#respond)\n\nName (required)\n\n__\n\nEmail (required)\n\n__ (will not be published)\n\nComment\n\nPost\n\n## Useful links\u2026\n\n* * *\n\nKnow Your Money can help startups and small businesses to find the best\nfinance solutions.\n\n  * [Business bank accounts](https://startups.co.uk/go/knowyourmoneybusinessbanking) are an essential tool for new businesses.

Summit Middle School students participate in\na mountain biking program through the Youth Sports Alliance, which ran a pilot\nprogram over the last school year.**  \n _Courtesy of the Youth Sports Alliance_\n\nThe [Youth Sports Alliance](https://ysaparkcity.org/) __is expanding.\n\nThough the Park City nonprofit has historically focused on providing after-\nschool educational and athletic programming for Park City School District\nstudents, it is officially moving into the rest of the county and possibly\nbeyond.\n\nOver the last school year, the YSA provided a pilot program for students at\nSouth Summit Middle School on Fridays, when the school dismisses at 1:30 p.m.\nThe program, called ACTiV8, focuses on developing eight lifestyle qualities:\naccountability, confidence, equality, inspiration, kindness, leadership,\nrespect, and versatility through providing access to the variety of outdoor\nactivities like mountain biking and skiing that it currently offers to Park\nCity students. Emily Fisher, executive director of the YSA, says the program\nwas a hit, garnering participation from 20 percent of the 500-person student\nbody.\n\n\u201cThey really have very limited after-school programs in South Summit, so our\nprograms were very popular on their early release day,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://cdn.parkrecord.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/PR-logo-white.png)\n\n### Support Local Journalism\n\n[Donate](https://www.parkrecord.com/donate/?utm_source=article&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=donation&utm_term=&utm_content=mid-\narticle)\n\n  \n\nCam Schiedel, a South Summit Middle School parent, said the program provided a\nconstructive way for her daughter, Ellie, who is 13, to spend her Friday\nafternoons.\n\n\u201cIf you get home at 5 or 6 p.m., the kids don\u2019t really have anything going on\nfor four or five hours, so it was really great to have activities the kids\ncould choose from,\u201d Schiedel said.\n\nEllie participated in drama, a boxing fitness class and an art program, which\nall lasted about a month.\n\nFisher says the programs are \u201cbite sized\u201d so students can experience the\nactivity, and, if they like it, pursue it further. It also makes the cost more\nmanageable for parents.\n\nEnrollment in a program falls between $50-$235 dollars with most ranging\nbetween $50 and $125, depending on the sport, and includes transportation,\ncoaching and some equipment. The YSA also aims to provide scholarships to 25\npercent of its students. Families on the free and reduced lunch plan\nautomatically qualify.\n\nFisher says the organization\u2019s pilot programs almost always result in full-\nfledged adoption at the schools they visit. Since the 2013-2014 school year,\nthe nonprofit has gone from a participation rate of 800 students from four\nschools to 1,608 students from 11 schools.\n\nNow, Fisher says the YSA has reached a point where it needs to add staff\nbefore it can expand further.\n\nSouth Summit will be added to the nonprofit\u2019s purview regardless, but the YSA\nis also looking at expanding into the rest of Summit County and part of\nWasatch County, which Fisher says the Park City Community is supportive of.\nFisher said sign ups for South Summit parents will become available in August.\n\n\u201cThey feel like people who are vital to park city and work in Park City now\nlive in the surrounding county,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to make sure that they\nhave the same support as people in the Park City community have.\u201d\n\nVail Epic Promise, the philanthropic wing of Vail Resorts, which employs many\nmembers of Park City\u2019s working class who struggle with the rising cost of\nliving in the area, has been one of the main boosters, Fisher said.\n\nThe YSA is also a finalist for a $30,000 grant from the Women\u2019s Giving Fund.\nIf the Women\u2019s Giving Fund awarded YSA the grant, Fisher says it would jump\nstart further expansion by allowing the YSA to hire two part-time managers \u2013\none for the ACTiV8 program and one for a similar program called Get Out and\nPlay, which is for elementary-aged students. Once the programs have expanded\ninto new schools, Fisher said the sign-up fees will pay for the new positions\non their own within 12 to 18 months.\n\nIn addition to the new programs at South Summit, the YSA is hoping to move\ninto North Summit in the near future and establish a pilot program in Heber\nthis year as well. The winner of the Women\u2019s Giving Grant will be announced on\nJuly 8.\n\n __\n\n* * *\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://cdn.parkrecord.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/PR-logo-white.png)\n\n# Support Local Journalism\n\n **Readers around Park City and Summit County make the Park Record's work\npossible.

They are immune to damaging drug scandals\nand other controversies. Some rake in millions of dollars for their managers.\nAnd they do not ask for a cent in return.\n\nThey are virtual YouTubers, or VTubers -- digitally animated characters that\ncan play many of the roles human celebrities do, from performing in concerts\nto pitching products. They could transform advertising, TV news and\nentertainment as we know them.\n\nJapan has seen a surge in the number of these virtual entertainers in the past\ncouple of years. The \"population\" has surpassed 9,000, up from 200 at the\nbeginning of 2018, according to Tokyo web analytics company User Local.\n\nOne startup executive in the business said the most popular VTubers could\nbring in several hundred million yen, or several million dollars, a year.\n\nNorikazu Hayashi, CEO of a production company called Balus -- whose website\npromises \"immersive experiences\" and a \"real and virtual world crossover\" --\nestimates the annual market for the avatars at somewhere between 5 billion and\n10 billion yen ($46.2 million and $92.4 million). He reckons the figure will\nhit 50 billion yen in the coming years.\n\nThe most famous VTuber of them all is Kizuna AI -- a young girl with a big\npink ribbon in her hair. She has around 6 million followers across YouTube,\nTikTok, Twitter and Instagram. She puts on concerts, posts video game\ncommentary, releases photo books and appears in commercials and TV shows.\n\nThe startup behind Kizuna AI -- the AI stands for artificial intelligence --\nis Activ8. It has a stable of about 50 other VTubers and relies on license\nfees for using the characters in ads, as well as events and novelties.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F4%2F1%2F5%2F2%2F24262514-3-eng-\nGB%2FCropped-1578302994kizunaai.jpg?source=nar-cms) Kizuna AI's YouTube\nchannel: Japan's most popular VTuber has around 6 million followers across\nYouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Instagram.\n\n[Gree](/Companies/GREE-Inc), a Japanese company better known for its social\nmobile games, has also become a virtual talent producer. \"The business is\nbasically the same as a talent agency, where the aim is to cultivate a\ncelebrity's popularity,\" a spokesperson said. But unlike people, the virtual\nstars are intellectual property, potentially giving companies more ways to\nextract money from them.\n\n\"As with Japan's anime culture, we will be able to export our content overseas\nand expand the business,\" the Gree representative said.\n\nAlthough VTubers are a fairly new phenomenon, the motion capture technology\nbehind them is not. Hollywood has used it for years. At Gree's studio, in\nTokyo's Roppongi district, actors wearing suits studded with over 50 sensors\nperform movements that become high-quality animations.\n\nA character created in a studio can be beamed to anywhere with a high-speed\ninternet connection. Data collected by the sensors can be turned into computer\ngraphics and transmitted in real time. The full-scale launch of 5G wireless\nconnectivity is expected to lead to even more VTubers.\n\nGree has also developed a smartphone app called REALITY that lets anyone turn\nthemselves into their own virtual streamer. Users can customize their avatar\nby choosing its hair style and color, along with the shape of its eyes and\nface. Then they can livestream with the touch of a button.\n\n\"It's basically an advanced Instagram filter,\" one startup executive said of\nGree's app.\n\nThe benefit, Gree says, is that users can \"express themselves and talk about\ntheir daily struggles or frustrations without showing their faces.\"\n\n\"Once the platform's user base grows, we will think about overseas expansion,\"\nthe spokesperson said.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F2%2F0%2F5%2F0%2F24190502-1-eng-\nGB%2FMYK_0134ref.jpg?source=nar-cms) Gree's REALITY app lets anyone create\ntheir own virtual livestreamer. (Photo by Yuki Kohara)\n\nCover, another VTuber management company, is already attracting attention\noutside Japan. \"We have many fans in China but also see a growing number of\nfans in the West, as well as Indonesia,\" said Motoaki Tanigo, Cover's CEO.\n\n\"Depending on future demand, we plan to take our business abroad,\" he added.\n\nCluster, a virtual event services startup, saw the number of events involving\nvirtual entertainers on its platform soar to over 100 in 2019, from just two\nthe year before, according to CEO Naoto Kato.\n\nTo watch a Cluster event, fans at home don virtual reality headsets, placing\navatars of themselves in a virtual venue. Besides watching the show, the\nviewers can throw stars or set off fireworks by paying some money. Most of the\nevents are concerts.\n\n\"Music will be the key to VTubers and virtual entertainers becoming\nmainstream,\" Kato said.\n\nWell-known brands are beginning to discover the marketing power of VTubers.\nSuntory Beer, [Rohto Pharmaceutical](/Companies/Rohto-Pharmaceutical-Co.-Ltd)\nand e-commerce group DMM.com have all created their own virtual characters\nthat go on TV shows, appear in commercials and stream on YouTube.\n\nTV Tokyo, one of Japan's major broadcasters, has even created a virtual news\nanchor named Yuuka Aiuchi. She appears on the station's news programs and asks\nquestions about the day's coverage.\n\nThis could be a way for broadcasters to drum up interest at a time when fewer\nyoung people are watching TV and ad revenue is declining.\n\nThe internet is quickly becoming a bigger advertising market than television,\naccording to top ad agency Dentsu: Spending on online ads jumped 16% to 1.75\ntrillion yen in 2018, driving a 2% increase in overall ad outlays to 6.53\ntrillion yen.\n\nBut TV ad spending fell 1.8% to 1.78 trillion yen.\n\nJapan's broadcasting industry has also been reeling from a series of celebrity\nscandals over questionable contract practices and drug use, including the\nrecent arrest of actress Erika Sawajiri for alleged ecstasy possession. In\nsome cases, TV stations have had to scramble to keep shows on the air.\n\nReleasing VTuber content on YouTube and social media platforms could help TV\nbroadcasters connect with viewers who are glued to their smartphones -- with\nno risk of the virtual characters becoming tabloid fodder.\n\nScraping up funds for virtual talent projects, however, can still be a\nchallenge, industry insiders say. Although some venture capital firms and game\ncompanies have invested in VTuber startups, \"Financing is still very hard to\nfind for those that are not profitable yet,\" Cluster's Kato said.\n\n\"It is important for these VTubers to become actual intellectual properties,\nlike popular series Dragon Ball or Pokemon, to expand the market,\" he said.\n\"Otherwise, VTuber content will only catch on with a niche audience, most\nlikely people who are already interested in Japanese anime.\"\n\n _Additional reporting by Kenjiro Suzuki and Ami

[\n](/my/account/emailthispage/) __ 0 comment __\n\nBUS chiefs have announced changes to several routes covering Andover and the\nwider area in a bid to improve punctuality.\n\nStagecoach is altering some of its from Sunday, September 1, following a\nreview of its network and to reflect the needs of schools and colleges.\n\nThe new timetable will mainly affect routes travelling to Basingstoke,\nWinchester and Salisbury.\n\nOn the Activ8 there will be minor timetable changes of a minute or two at all\ntimes, with bigger changes mainly before 9am and after 3pm on weekdays to\n\"better reflect the time that it actually takes for buses to complete their\njourneys\".\n\nSaturday early morning and evening times have also been changed.\n\nTimetable changes will also be in place for the 85 and 86 services, with\nmorning journeys mainly affected to suit the new times at Peter Symonds\nCollege.\n\nAnd students travelling to Sparsholt College from Andover should now use\nservice 851.\n\nFollowing Wheelers decision to stop running the Wiltshire section of the 87\nroute Stagecoach has announced that it will operate off-peak journeys on\nMondays to Saturdays between Lopcombe Corner and Salisbury via Winterslow,\nPitton and Firs Road.\n\nThe operator has announced that times will be available shortly.\n\nIntermediate time changes will also come into play on the 76 service to\nimprove punctuality.\n\nTo view the new timetables,

The piece which will be aired\nearly in August will show how easily thousands of people are being scammed\nevery day.\n\nFive Devon choirs and singing groups, plus six budding soloists and a local\nband, came together by the VoiceWorx Community Choir in Kentisbeare and\nmusical director Alan Boxer to provide six hours of non-stop fund-raising\nentertainment.\n\nIt's thought around 300 people attended the concert during the day, with\nVoiceWorx Choir, Cullompton Community Choir, Bel Canto Choir, young singers\nfrom Bolham Community Primary School, some soloists and a showcase from Activ8\nyouth theatre, plus Marram Grass folk band and Steve Waters entertaining.\n\n##### Read More\n\n##### Related Articles\n\n  * [ ](https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devon-choir-who-were-scammed-2819888)[Devon choir who were scammed out of thousands plea for tenors and tenners](https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devon-choir-who-were-scammed-2819888)\n\nThe performers showcased talent from Devon, all of them coming together to\nhelp ensure VoiceWorx will survive as an organisation following an email scam\nwhich robbed their cash reserves of \u00a32,300.\n\nVoiceWorx members were naturally extremely disappointed by the response to\nthis theft of their funds and the lack of support offered to the choir by all\nof the banks involved. Banks told the choir they have fulfilled their legal\nobligations and cannot help the choir after the scammers sent bogus, but\nhighly plausible emails posing as officers of the choir and took advantage of\nwhat turned out to be a series of coincidences.\n\nA self-funding community choir established over ten years ago, Voiceworx choir\nhas given thousands of pounds to charity over the decade with the proceeds\nfrom concerts, so this theft is particularly galling as it hits the whole\ncommunity.\n\nVoiceworx has lost their funds for advance payment of members\u2019 fees for the\nyear, as well as funds accumulated to hold a choir festival in May. As a\nresult, the May Festival ran at a loss due to the website not being ready as\nthe website designers stopped work until they were reassured they would be\npaid.\n\n##### Read More\n\n##### Related Articles\n\n  * [ ](https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/musical-lovers-wicked-weekend-activ8-2678028)[Musical lovers have a Wicked weekend with Activ8 Theatre](https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/musical-lovers-wicked-weekend-activ8-2678028)\n\n(Image: Voiceworx)\n\nDespite informing the police and banks, it is unlikely that they will do\nanything more to recover the stolen funds.\n\nAfter many internal and external investigations, Voiceworx Chair Barbara Wood\nconcluded: \u201cThe scammers who hit us with this awful scam only succeeded in the\ntheft through what looks to have been a sad series of unforeseen coincidences\nwhich led us to this appalling situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder for us all to be extremely careful when making any\npayments over the internet to what looks to be a legitimate business for the\nprovision of a service. The moral has to be: Check, check and check again\n\n\u201cBut we are determined not to be beaten and aim to build our funds back up.\nThis Summer Festival will hopefully be another step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cAnd many very talented singers are joining in to support Voiceworx cause to\nhelp entertain and raise funds too, including Cullompton Community Choir, Bel\nCanto and Bolham Primary School singers.\u201d\n\n##### Read More\n\n##### Related Articles\n\n  * [ ](https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/scammers-con-devon-choir-out-2618792)[Scammers con Devon choir out of more than \u00a32,300](https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/scammers-con-devon-choir-out-2618792)\n\nVoiceworx Musical Director Alan Boxer added: \u201cThis theft has been a huge\nsetback for us, but we won\u2019t be beaten by it and our choir\u2019s morale is high.\n\n\u201cI am personally delighted that all of these singers and musicians are coming\ntogether to support VoiceWorx at this difficult time. We hope to be back on\ntrack soon and able to raise funds for other charities again next year.\u201d\n\nDonations on the day just exceeded \u00a31,000, and can still be made at the Just\nGiving,

AI](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/1.jpg?fit=578%2C280&strip=all)\n\nArtie\u2019s latest demo avatar AI\n\n[Back in August](https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/13/understand-the-power-of-\nthe-avatar-will-be-essential-for-vrs-future/) I explored the profound role\nthat avatars will play in shaping our experience of immersive worlds in VR. I\ndiscussed how [virtual embodiment](https://www.matrise.no/2018/07/virtual-\nembodiment/) will stretch our sense of self on multiple levels, be it\nphysical, physiological, or psychological. While it is not at all an\nexaggeration to suggest that avatars will shift our conception of identity and\nself-expression into uncharted territory that we cannot, as of yet, readily\ncomprehend or fully appreciate, that is only half the story.\n\nAvatars will not only be our vehicle for entering immersive worlds, but also\nthe doorway through which a new breed of intelligent characters will step\nthrough to greet us and guide our navigation through it. Let me explain how.\n\n## The rise of virtual influencers\n\nDuring the past few years, we have witnessed the growing popularity of virtual\ncelebrities like Brud\u2019s [Lil Miquela](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/the-\nmakers-of-the-virtual-influencer-lil-miquela-snag-real-money-from-silicon-\nvalley/) and Activ8\u2019s [Kizuna\nAI](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-\nover-youtube), which have spawned a whole industry to rise in their wake. The\nappeal of these fictional characters goes hand in hand with their talent for\nbelievability, while their market potential is confined to a trade off between\ntheir potential reach and the degree of interactivity made possible by any\nparticular medium.\n\nTake a virtual celebrity on Instagram, for instance. It has broad reach but\nthe level of interactivity is low, which means a pretty passive relationship\nbetween a virtual character and its audience. YouTube, on the other hand,\noffers a digital persona like Kizuna AI greater interactivity since it is\nhuman-powered, but it is still ultimately restricted to the limitations of a\nvideo.\n\nImmersive mediums like VR and AR, however, can offer these virtual characters\nthe level of interactivity they need in order for their evolution to continue\nto manifest as a natural progression enabled by the fact that spatial\ncomputing represents arguably the strongest convergence point for AI.\n\n[![GamesBeat Summit - It's a time of change in the game industry. Hosted\nonline April 28-29.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/GamesBeatSummitTimeofChange.png?strip=all)![GamesBeat\nSummit - It's a time of change in the game industry. Hosted online April\n28-29.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/GamesBeatSummitTimeofChange.png?strip=all)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gamesbeat-\nsummit-2020-tickets-60771924462?aff=article)\n\n## XR + AI brings 2D Pinocchio to life\n\nAI is the tech that can infuse virtual characters with the intelligent anatomy\nrequired to engage with humans in a fashion that is becoming increasingly, for\nlack of a better word, empathic. Branches of AI like machine learning, natural\nlanguage processing, computer vision, and sentiment analysis wrap together as\na sort of spatial computing synergy that quickens the artificial souls of\nthese characters to life, not just as the singular personal assistants that we\nare already familiar with, but as a multitude of purposeful personas that\nwander through the [enabled AR\nlandscape](https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/19/the-enabled-landscape-is-the-\nfuture-of-augmented-reality/) in embodied form.\n\n\u201cWe believe that everyone\u2019s favorite characters from books, movies, video\ngames, comics, and toys will come alive and begin interacting with their fans.\nThese characters will be joined by the avatars of celebrities, musicians, and\nathletes.\u201d said Armando Kirwin, cofounder at [Artie](https://www.artie.com/),\nthe company that enables brands to create and share AI avatars. \u201cNot only\nthat, but banks, grocery stores, retailers, and other businesses will each\nwant to have their own avatar too. If you combine all of these use cases, you\nget what we call \u201cthe avatar layer,\u201d a layer of millions of avatars around the\nworld that become increasingly useful, intelligent, and fun to interact with.\u201d\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/0.gif?resize=320%2C240&strip=all)![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/0.gif?resize=320%2C240&strip=all)\n\n## Enter the \u201cAvatar Layer\u201d\n\nThe vision pairs inseparably with the emergence of 5G and its capacity to\nupend the mobile market as we know it by wiping out our conception not only of\napps, but the idea of \u201cdownloading and installing\u201d, which may very well become\narchaic terms within 5 to 10 years. As 5G becomes commonplace, so too will the\navatar layer offer instantaneous immersive experiences in the form of virtual\ncharacters that I hope will make some readers reminiscent of the magically\ninterdimensional world as depicted in the 1988 film, [_Who Framed Roger\nRabbit_.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit)\n\nLast December I discussed how the [AR\nCloud](https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/18/the-ar-cloud-will-infuse-meaning-\ninto-every-object-in-the-real-world/) will serve as the connective tissue that\nbinds AR experiences together to the physical world, which will allow for\nsimultaneous and multiplayer access for everyone in real-time. The AR Cloud is\nalso referred to as the [mirrorworld](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-\nar-next-big-tech-platform/), which is an apt way to describe how this parallel\ndigital reality will exist simultaneously and in-sync with the real one.\n\nHere is how Ryan Horrigan, cofounder and CEO at Artie, describes how it will\nplay out in practical terms:\n\n\u201cIn our view, you won\u2019t need the Disney app loaded onto your phone before you\narrive with your kids at Disneyland. A Mickey Mouse avatar will simply appear,\nif you give it permission to, as an instant app over 5G as it senses you are\nin the geo-fence of the park. Mickey\u2019s avatar will then lead you through the\npark, booking you on rides and making you lunch reservations, all while\nentertaining you as your guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, for GEICO, when I\u2019m in a car accident, I won\u2019t need their app to\nalready be on my phone. I\u2019ll just ask to talk to the lizard and he will help\nme collect photos of the scene and file my report. We believe instant apps,\nenabled by 5G, will use avatars as their primary UI in the future, and we\u2019re\nvery excited about that.\u201d\n\nThe mirrorworld will be populated by its own parallel universe of objects;\ninnate and alive, passively and actively manifesting within its own scale and\nscope, as well as embedded as the digital dopplegangers of real world objects.\nIt is in this context that autonomous avatars will be to the mirrorworld what\nhumans are to the real one, and it is Artie\u2019s [Wonderfriend\nEngine](https://www.artie.com/) platform that will allow brands and companies\nto generate their first wave of characters, and with the accompanying\nintelligence and narrative design to actively live within the avatar layer.\n\n\u201cImmersive characters will outnumber humans 100x in the near future. Your\nphysical reality will be filled with AI holograms, living toys, virtual\nteachers, proxies, and familiars. Every fictional character you ever loved\nwill be walking around IRL with you.\u201d Kirwin has pinned to his [Twitter\nprofile](https://twitter.com/armandokirwin).\n\n## Reactive to the human condition\n\nAutonomous avatars literally personify the culmination of what it means to be\nhuman-centric. It is an appeal back to our evolutionary nature, which is the\nyearning for an interface that is human-like and interactive at an empathetic\nlevel. For example, Artie\u2019s tech can detect dozens of objects and a host of\nfacial expressions so that avatars can be responsive to the dynamic world\naround it, but more importantly, the mood of a user in real-time.\n\nThis is where the breakthrough invariably rests: in the AI\u2019s capacity to\nenable avatars to invoke a genuine emotional connection with humans by\nresponding to them as if intuitively.\n\nThe still very nascent space has surprisingly few active players, one of which\nis [Fable](https://fable-studio.com/) and their work in enabling their\nautonomous VR avatars, or what they are referring to as \u201c[virtual\nbeings](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/326926)\u201d, establish a two-way\ndialogue between the character and the user. The approach is embodied in their\nown virtual star, a 8-year old girl named Lucy, who can respond, react, and\nremember in an ongoing spoken dialogue that transcends the usual fabric of\ntime and space for what would otherwise be a scripted chatbot.\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/0.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&strip=all)![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/0.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&strip=all)\n\nAbove: Fable\u2019s Lucy AI character in \u201cWhispers in the Night\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to create a natural, organic conversation,\u201d Jessica Yaffa\nShamash, Creative Director at Fable told VentureBeat in an [interview in\nJanuary](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/24/vr-studio-fable-relaunches-as-ai-\nbased-virtual-beings-company-at-sundance/). \u201cIt feels like you can\u2019t see the\ntechnology behind the hood and it should feel like you are conversing with a\nreal person.\u201d\n\nLucy is designed to remember what a user says or did in one exchange and refer\nto it later as a reference point that offers the kind of atypical talent in\nmemory that humans are generally considered to be unique and alone in the\nuniverse in possessing. In fact, Fable plans to allow Lucy to carry her memory\nto go metaversal by holding its artificial psyche intact across platforms and\nimmersive worlds; wherever it is you might encounter her and her \u201ckind\u201d.\n\nWhat is crystal clear is that as device capabilities and new methodologies\nallow us to better capture, digest, and leverage the [nonverbal\nparts](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/24/valve-psychologist-explores-\ncontrolling-games-directly-with-your-brain/) of a communication \u2014 like eye\ntracking, EEG sensors, and my startup\u2019s\n[neurometrics](https://vrscout.com/news/xr-attention-lab-body-language/) \u2014 the\navatar layer\u2019s bandwidth for embracing the human condition will continue to\nwiden to an elevated degree that is unprecedented, yet not necessarily\nsurprising. Autonomous avatars, along with the work directed towards creating\na bonafide brain-computer interface, will begin to pierce this next veil in\nfrictionless design.\n\n_Amir Bozorgzadeh is CEO at Virtuleap, the startup that enables the body to\nspeak in VR and AR using neuroscience research and machine learning, so that\ncompanies and brands can know if their users are excited, angry, or bored out\nof their minds._\n\n##  GamesBeat Summit\n\nThe same great speakers & intimate networking\n\nHosted Online\n\nApril 28 - 29\n\n[Register Today](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gamesbeat-\nsummit-2020-tickets-60771924462?aff=rightrail)\n\n## Most Read\n\n  * [ ![Sea of Thieves](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sea-ofthieves.png?resize=350%2C175&strip=all) ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/sea-of-thieves-free-update-ships-of-fortune-sets-sail-april-22/) [ Sea of Thieves free update Ships of Fortune sets sail April 22 ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/sea-of-thieves-free-update-ships-of-fortune-sets-sail-april-22/)\n  * [ ![Mike is playing Hearthstone, and I can see that because of the Xbox Game Bar.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-07.png?resize=350%2C175&strip=all) ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/xbox-game-bar-gets-widget-store-with-support-for-xsplit-and-more/) [ Xbox Game Bar gets Widget Store with support for Xsplit and more ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/xbox-game-bar-gets-widget-store-with-support-for-xsplit-and-more/)\n  * [ ![Grounded.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Grounded-Cast-1.png?resize=350%2C175&strip=all) ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/obsidians-grounded-enters-early-access-on-july-28/) [ Obsidian's Grounded enters early access on July 28 ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/obsidians-grounded-enters-early-access-on-july-28/)\n  * [ ![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ledmask-e1586289955808.jpg?resize=350%2C175&strip=all) ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/oculus-designer-creates-led-face-mask-to-encourage-social-distancing/) [ Oculus designer creates LED face mask to encourage social distancing ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/oculus-designer-creates-led-face-mask-to-encourage-social-distancing/)\n  * [ ![Sony PlayStation 5 controller, the DualSense.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dualsense.jpg?resize=350%2C175&strip=all) ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/why-the-playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-is-special/) [ Why the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller is special ](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/07/why-the-playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-is-special/)\n\n##  [UPCOMING EVENTS](/events/)\n\n  * [GamesBeat Summit](https://www.gamesbeatsummit.com/) Apr. 28-29\n\nThe industry\u2019s most intimate gaming event for senior industry executives,\ndevelopers and investors.\n\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-UkS7f9ZMSZ6hP.gif)\n\n"}, {"item": "Watch: It's never too late to try!

I was\nlooking for something to do.\n\n\"I'm really enjoying it, especially the chance to throw Barry onto the mat,\nbut it has given me a new lease of life and I want to go as far as I can with\nit.\n\nMr Roberts, from Cheshire View, Brymbo said: \"I enjoy coming to the gym. The\nfirst time I ever went was four years ago but it wasn't until recently that\nBarry suggested I give judo a go.\n\n\"The only thing I had done previously was a parachute jump.\n\n\"I was over the moon to get the red-belt grading. Darren was genuinely very\nimpressed with what we could do.\n\n\"My favourite move is the Kesa-getame hold.\n\n\"I enjoy the sport and what we're doing proves it doesn't matter what age you\nare.

The award was only one of twenty\ngiven at LERN's annual conference in Savannah, Georgia, which was recently\nattended by more than 650 professionals from three different countries who\nspecialize in lifelong learning.  \n  \n\"The award is for innovation in the field of lifelong learning and serving\ncommunities,\" noted LERN President William A. Draves. With over 1,000\norganizations focused on lifelong learning within the LERN community, Draves\nclaimed that \"winning an International Award is an outstanding event.\"  \n  \nColumbus State University Continuing & Professional Education re-engaged\ncustomers in the community by redesigning their Activ8 catalog, in which they\nadded interactive features for children to enjoy as their parents read over\nprospective camps, reorganized by week to make planning easier. This allowed\nchildren to become more engaged in their upcoming learning experience and\nraised their excitement to participate in the program.  \n  \n\"We are honored to be recognized by LERN,\" said Samantha Gurski, assistant\ndirector for the department. \"Activ8 is a special program that brings\nthousands of kids between the ages of 4-18 years old to the main campus of\nColumbus State University from May until August. We want all area kids to be\nable to experience an Activ8 summer, full of robotics, art, cooking, science,\nathletics, and more. We are beyond excited that the redesign has made it even\neasier for parents and children to choose among Activ8's 200+ STEAM camps.\"  \n  \nActiv8 has also been recognized as Columbus's Favorite Camp in the Muscogee\nMoms 2019 Choice Awards. Registration is currently open for 2019 summer camps,\nwhich will run from May 28 - August 2.

Despite the financial and physical\ncommitment required for these treks, Coutts said the pay off was well worth\nthe work.\n\n\"Learning that your body can do anything you want it to, it makes you mentally\nstrong and you believe you can do anything you can set your mind to.\"\n\nThe Northland group have been fundraising prior to the trip and have raised\n$14,000 for Tanzania's Kimnyake Secondary School to aid in its building costs\nand resources.\n\nDream It owner Michael Davis said completing big physical tasks such as\nKilimanjaro were unforgettable experiences for people.\n\n\"You get a massive sense of belief and confidence out of doing it,\" he said.\n\n\"Taking everyday people to do extraordinary things is great because it's not\nas impossible as people think.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\nFor more information, visit www.dreamit.co.nz\n\nPrint this article\n\nShare via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Bookmark this\narticle\n\nShare on Facebook facebook\n\nShare on Twitter twitter\n\nShare via email email\n\nShare on LinkedIn linkedin\n\nShare on Google Plus google-plus\n\nShare on Whatsapp whatsapp\n\nShare on Pinterest pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit reddit\n\nTrending Topics\n\n  * [Northland property values still rising; first-home buyers a quarter of the market](northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid=12263868)\n  * [The deadly highway to Northland](/indepth/national/northlands-deadly-highway/)\n  * [Cannabis: Green Fairy helps herself and others with illegal green stuff](/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid=12263243)\n  * [Northern Advocate archive](/northern-advocate/news/archive.cfm?c_id=1503450)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Advertise with NZME.](//advertising.nzme.co.nz/)\n\n## Latest News\n\n[ NORTHERN ADVOCATE |  Lifestyle ](/northern-\nadvocate/lifestyle/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503444)\n\n###  [Do you feel stiff like the Tin Man?](/northern-\nadvocate/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503444&objectid=12323005)\n\n7 Apr, 2020 8:36am\n\n5 minutes to read\n\n[ NORTHERN ADVOCATE ](/northern-advocate/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503450)\n\n###  [School's music initiative shows power of uniting\npeople](/coronavirus/news/article.cfm?c_id=1504828&objectid=12321539)\n\n1 Apr, 2020 11:24am\n\n3 minutes to read\n\n[ THE COUNTRY ](/the-country/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=16)\n\n###  [Eco-sanctuary hatching plans for rare wildlife](/the-\ncountry/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=12322930)\n\n6 Apr, 2020 5:09pm\n\n3 minutes to read\n\n[ NORTHERN ADVOCATE |  Lifestyle ](/northern-\nadvocate/lifestyle/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503444)\n\n###  [Listen to Jacinda or Mother Nature and hunker down](/northern-\nadvocate/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503444&objectid=12323063)\n\n7 Apr, 2020 9:54am\n\n3 minutes to read\n\n## Most popular\n\n[ ![How PM responded to this Washington Post headline: 'NZ isn't just\nflattening the curve.

The nonprofit\nis hoping hundreds of Treasure Mountain Junior High School kids participate in\nsimilar programs this school year.**  \n _(Park Record file photo)_\n\nWhen the Youth Sports Alliance unveiled a new program last year aimed at\ngetting middle school students involved in sports and other activities, there\nwas just one problem.\n\nEighth-graders were left out. The program, called ACTiV8, was for grades six\nand seven at Ecker Hill Middle School, and meanwhile, ninth-graders at\nTreasure Mountain Junior High School are eligible to participate in\nextracurricular activities through the high school.\n\n\u201c(Eighth grade) was kind of like the middle child,\u201d said Heather Sims,\ndirector of youth programs for the Youth Sports Alliance. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Wait,\nwe\u2019ve kind of forgotten about eighth grade here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSims helped cook up a remedy. The Youth Sports Alliance this school year is\nexpanding ACTiV8 to Treasure Mountain, giving both eighth- and ninth-graders\naccess to activities like mountain biking, rowing and disc golf.\n\nThe Youth Sports Alliance has long offered sports opportunities to elementary\nstudents in Park City through its popular Get Out & Play program. But after\nlearning that many Ecker Hill students take buses to hang out in Redstone\nafter early release from school on Fridays, Sims wanted to provide them with a\nmore productive -- and supervised -- way to spend their time.\n\n\u201cAt that middle school age, it\u2019s a fine line between being good kids and\ntaking the wrong path,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom that, ACTiV8 was born. Sims\u2019 first step was to call on the area\u2019s\nbusinesses and nonprofits. They were enthusiastic about the idea, pledged to\npitch in and were ultimately a major reason the program was successful in its\ninaugural year at Ecker Hill.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of them said they would help,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\nwanted to put something on, but they didn\u2019t really know how to go about it.\u201d\n\nThe organizations have once again offered their backing for the expansion to\nTreasure Mountain, Sims said. However, the list of activities that will be\navailable comes from the students, who selected the kinds of things they\u2019re\ninterested in pursuing. There will plenty of athletic endeavors, but offerings\nlike photography for students who want to participate but don\u2019t necessarily\nenjoy sports will also be included.\n\nAmy Jenkins, assistant principal at Treasure Mountain, said giving students\nthe control to pick the offerings increases participation.\n\n\u201cIf you somehow present it as their idea, they\u2019ll come in droves,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut as soon as you say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got this great idea,\u2019 they run the other\ndirection.\u201d\n\nShe added that taking part in extracurricular activities is a great way for\nstudents to learn skills they\u2019ll carry through life and also help them become\nwell balanced and happy.\n\n\u201cIt teaches teamwork, it teaches collaboration,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it keeps kids\nin a structured environment so they\u2019re making good decisions. I think what we\nsee about the physical activities, and even some of the creative ones, is that\nit\u2019s stress relief. It\u2019s a fun way to kind of let down and enjoy doing\nsomething.\u201d\n\nSims said that the Youth Sports Alliance is happy to play a leading role in\nproviding students with those kinds of opportunities.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, there\u2019s a need as a community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the age\nwhere it\u2019s critical to get the kids involved in activities. There are\nobviously a lot of kids involved in ski programs, but there are a lot of kids\nwho don\u2019t have anything.\u201d\n\n _For more information about ACTiV8, visit the Youth Sports Alliance website,\nysaparkcity.org. Programs begin Sept. 18 at Treasure Mountain and will run\nthroughout the school year.

The story encourages each of us to\napproach each day with goodwill, wonder and cheer.\n\n(Image: Maria Thorne, Kentisbeare)\n\n(Image: Maria Thorne, Kentisbeare)\n\nBuddy the Elf, played by one of ACTiv8s newest members Erin Andrews, is a fun,\nenthusiastic, larger than life character that will make you feel overly\nChristmassy and promises to add some \u2018sparklejolleytwinkle\u2019 to your day.\n\nElf Jr is the second Christmas musical from ACTiv8, following on from their\nsell out production of Annie Jr last December. The group meet every Sunday\nafternoon in Kentisbeare Village Hall. From their first rehearsal this term\nthe young people at ACTiv8 have worked amazingly well together with their\nleaders, Alan Boxer (Musical Director), Fiona Bartlett (Choreographer) and\nJenny Archer (Director), to create this fantastic festive experience for your\ncommunity to enjoy.\n\n(Image: Maria Thorne, Kentisbeare)\n\nACTiv8\u2019s Stage Manager, Fiona Shere, said:\u201cTo put a whole show together in\njust 10 rehearsals is certainly a challenge, but the results are totally\namazing because we have such a talented cast.\u201d  \nACTiv8 will perform Elf The Musical JR. on December 1 and 2 at The Venue,\nUffculme School. Tickets are \u00a38 for adults and \u00a35 for children and are\navailable at www.activ8theatre.net/tickets.\n\nMore Information on how to join ACTiv8 next term is on our website.\n\n#### Read

According to organizers, it is \u201cNOT a concert ... NOT a fundraiser ...\nNOT a prayer meeting to lift up the needs of our community.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a bit of all three.\n\nHosted by Water Street Mission, WJTL and Willow Valley, Reverberate Lancaster\nis scheduled as a faith-based celebration of \u201cwhat unites us.\u201d\n\nThe evening will highlight churches and ministries that are \u201cmaking a\ndifference\u201d in the county. Praise teams from Victory Church, Activ8 and East\nPetersburg Mennonite Church and the McCaskey High School Gospel Choir will\nperform.\n\n####  [ Sign up for our newsletter ](/newsletters)\n\n**Success!** An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup.\n\n**Error!** There was an error processing your request.\n\nFood -- Our weekly food newsletter featuring seasonal recipes, local\nrestaurant information, and kitchen tips & tricks.\n\n__\n\nSign up __\n\n[Manage your lists](https://lancasteronline.com/users/admin/mailinglist/)\n\nBy opting into newsletters you are agreeing to our [privacy\npolicy](https://steinmancommunications.com/your-privacy-rights/).\n\nThe idea for the event arose from a pastors\u2019 conference sponsored by Water\nStreet Mission. Thom Scott, Water Street\u2019s marketing director, said they\nwanted \u201cto get people in (various) churches together. We wanted to take time\nto celebrate each other.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, officials at Water Street Mission have met with pastors to\ndiscuss the role of churches as it relates to the mission and to the community\nat large.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to show what God\u2019s doing in the county,\u201d Scott said.\n\nThe nondenominational gathering will intersperse music and messages.

Lead at Activ8 and a UNICEF\nRepresentative has called on parents to enrol their children in school in\ntheir formative years to enable them to maximise their future wellbeing.  \n  \nHe said the formative years of children entailed their emotional, social and\nphysical development that has a direct effect on their overall growth into\nadulthood.  \n  \nHe made this call at the Launch of the Right Age Enrolment Campaign (RAEC) in\nHohoe in the Volta region sponsored by UNICEF in collaboration with Ministry\nof Education and Ghana Education Service (GES) and the USAID.  \n  \nHe said as standard, every child of school-going age should be enrolled in\nKindergarten at age four.  \n  \nHe said Right Age Enrolment Campaign is aimed to sensitize the public on the\nessence of RAEC, achieve the Right of the Child to education, eliminate or\nreduce high rate of Gross enrolment in schools, identify obstacles and help\nfind suitable remedies and ensure excellent basic cycle education in a\nconducive environment.  \n  \nMr. Owusu-Abrokwa said UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and the GES have\nidentified 30 Districts and Municipalities to partner with on the Right Age\nEnrolment Campaign activation.  \n  \nHe noted that a total of 260 District Education Officers were trained between\n2016 and 2017 across 20 districts in Community/Social mobilization strategies,\nBehaviour analysis, development and interpersonal communication skills as\nefforts to make the campaign successful.  \n  \nMadam Gladys Amenya, the Hohoe Municipal Education Director said a 2018/2019\ndata on Education in the Municipality shows that 43.14 per cent of children of\nschool-going age have not enrolled at the right age.  \n  \nShe said the situation tends to affect the retention of the child, proper\nmental development, and acquisition of skills and interpersonal and social\nbehaviour of pupils.  \n  \nMr. Andrews Teddy Ofori, the Hohoe Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) said\nchildren should not be allowed to waste their formative years at home instead\nbeing educated and urged participants to be agents in ensuring that children\nare enrolled at the appropriate age.  \n  \nHe also noted that the unavailability in schools in some deprived areas where\nchildren have to walk distances to school affects the enrolment ages of some\nchildren.  \n  \nMadam Akpene A. Adeti, Early Childhood Development and Basic One Coordinator,\nHohoe Municipal Education Office noted that although efforts by successive\ngovernments to make Basic and Secondary education accessible, some children of\nschool-going ages are still not in school.  \n  \nShe said there is, therefore, the need for parents, traditional and religious\nand opinion leaders, teachers and pupils to collaborate and support the Right\nAge Enrolment Campaign.  \n  \nShe tasked teachers to show love and respect to all children, use concrete\nteaching materials, plan and deliver lessons systematically and make teaching\nchild-centred to help in children\u2019s development.  \n  \nShe also called on parents to guide and direct their children\u2019s learning by\nserving as primary educators, encourage and support children\u2019s interest and\nunique ways of learning.\n\nSend your news stories to ** ** and via WhatsApp on **+233 55 2699 625.**\n\n### Join our

event to bring the curtain down on their\nhugely successful school holiday programme.\n\nHailed as a 'celebration of community' it was an action-packed day with an\ninflatables run, entertainers, games, food and a disco to get the party\nstarted.\n\nThis summer the centre reached out to help cut the cost of the school break by\nrunning holidays hubs and playschemes with day trips for the kids.\n\nCentre manager Willie Wilson said: \"The fun day was an amazing success.\n\n\"It was really, really busy.\n\n\"We had at least 600 people through our door.\n\n\"This was a celebration of our community and a great way to finish off our\nsummer activities.\"\n\nOver the last few weeks the centre ran a programme of free family activities\nthree days a week with lunch provided and a total of 130 families registered\nfor the events.\n\nThe playscheme took youngsters on trips to popular visitor attractions like\nBlair Drummond Safari Park and Heads of Ayr Farm Park.\n\nThe centre would like to say thanks to Gillian Maxwell from Amazon for the\ngames and decorations, Activ8 Our Place for a \u00a3250 donation and Tesco for the\nhot dog rolls.\n\nThey would also like to say thank you to Hot Stuff Disco, entertainer Uncle\nBilly and everyone else who contributed to a successful summer.\n\n[\n](whatsapp://send?text=Branchton%20Community%20Centre%20put%20families%20first%20with%20a%20fantastic%20fun%20day%0A%0Ahttps://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2F17827087.branchton-\ncommunity-centre-put-families-first-fantastic-fun-day%2F%3fref%3Dwa)

Theyis also\nbelieved to operate, or have operated, similar programmes at other schools.\n\nOn Wednesday, parents turning up at Lethbridge Primary found that the Activ8\nstaff were not on site and instead a number of school personnel had stepped in\nto look after the children.\n\nThe following morning, headteacher Lisa Mayes confirmed that after being\ninformed of Ofsted's decision to suspend Activ8's licence, she had decided to\nterminate the school's relationship with the firm.\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"My first concern was to ensure that those children\ndue to be looked after by Activ8 after school yesterday were safe and able to\nattend an after school provision. Due to the goodwill and flexibility of our\nstaff we were able to do that.\n\n\"We have been able to secure a short term solution for the rest of this term\nto ensure that families, who rely on before and after school childcare, are\nable to access provision on our school site.\n\n\"Children will still be able to attend before and after school provision and\nthis will be managed by the school. I know how important it is for working\nparents to know that their childcare arrangements are secure and reliable and\nthat is why, as a school, we are working hard to ensure there is minimal\ndisruption to your usual routines.\n\n\"As a result of Ofsted's decision, we have decided to terminate our lettings\ncontract with Activ8.\"\n\nIt appears that the suspension came about as a result of a recent inspection\nof the after-school provision by Ofsted where \"breaches of safeguarding and\nwelfare requirements which were deemed to pose a risk to children\" were\nidentified.\n\nA spokesman said: \"Suspension is an interim measure and we will advise parents\nof any further decisions that are made about this registration in due course.\n\n\"Suspension is imposed for an initial six weeks from July 5. However, we will\nreview it before the expiry date if information is received to indicate the\nrisk to children has altered.\n\n\"We will write to parents to confirm the suspension as soon as we receive\ntheir details from the provider.\n\n\"The local authority family information service may be able to assist parents\nwith alternative care.\"\n\n[

It\u2019s all hands-on engagement and so much fun that\ncampers don\u2019t even know they are learning. Of course, our plan all along is to\nbring them to campus, get them excited about CSU, and plant the seed that\n'going to college' is a great thing to do.\u201d  \n  \nActiv8 Summer Camps, for children ages 4-18, offer a variety of programs that\nencourage kids to have fun while learning about technology, mathematics, art,\nsports, dance, sewing and more. Programs are taught on campus and at CSU\u2019s\noutreach centers, including the Coca-Cola Space Science Center and Oxbow\nMeadows Environmental Learning Center, and with the Columbus Regional Math\nCollaborative and the Schwob School of Music. Baseball, basketball,\ncheerleading, dance, golf, soccer, softball and tennis camps are offered in\npartnership with CSU Athletics.  \n  \nCamps begin May 30 and run through August 4, usually from 9 a.m to 4 p.m.\nBefore Care (7-9 a.m.) and After Care (4-6 p.m.) are offered on CSU's main\ncampus to accommodate the schedules of working parents.  \n  \nFor more information,

Bluewater Lagoon.\n\nThere were six events on offer, including the Uniteability Triathlon for\nchildren with disabilities who could choose to use a scooter, trike or pram\ninstead of a bike.\n\nEvent co-ordinator Nikki Giles said 133 children registered for the event.\n\n\n\n##### Photos\n\n[View Photo Gallery](/photos/kids-swim-ride-and-run-at-race-beside-the-\nriver/89130/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It gives

Recounting\nendless stories of low pay, a lack of respect from administrators, parents,\nstudents, and alarming school violence, many educators are leaving the\nclassroom for good and not looking back. As recent as April 2019, according to\nthe [NEA](http://neatoday.org/2019/04/29/national-average-teacher-salary/),\nthe average teaching salary has come down 4.5% over the past decade.\n\nAnd, when it comes to depression and anxiety, a survey from the [American\nFederation of\nTeachers](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/2017_eqwl_survey_web.pdf)\ncited the majority of American teachers feel high levels of stress at work,\nand poor mental health issues continue to climb. Over the past two years\nalone, they also found 61% of teachers claimed to feel stressed out, and 58%\nsaid their mental health was declining.\n\nAt the end of 2018, [ _The Wall Street\nJournal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/teachers-quit-jobs-at-highest-rate-on-\nrecord-11545993052?ns=prod/accounts-wsj)  reported that teachers walked away\nfrom their classrooms in record numbers. And, it's not only educators who are\nleaving the field. They also found departures within community colleges and\nfaculty, public school staff, school psychologists and custodians. Many\nemployees who work in essential support staff roles are leaving their jobs at\nthe fastest rate on record.\n\nThe situation has become dire. Many educators are currently looking for\npotential opportunities in different fields, learning how to pivot their\nskills, and some are also taking a chance in the entrepreneurial world. Until\nsomething changes, more disheartened public-school educators will continue to\nleave public education, and the lack of teacher talent will increase.\n\n[In the entrepreneurial world, we're seeing educators carving out niches of\ntheir\nown.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Frobynshulman%2F2019%2F06%2F17%2Fthis-\nentrepreneur-is-empowering-educators-to-build-their-own-tutoring-\nstartups%2F&text=In%20the%20entrepreneurial%20world%2C%20we%27re%20seeing%20educators%20carving%20out%20niches%20of%20their%20own.)\nIf you look back at some of [my former\nstories](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robynshulman/archive/#3bc54e46734b),\nyou'll find some teachers are making seven figures in their own businesses.\nMany teachers have built companies within the areas of curriculum development,\npersonal coaching, and tutoring.\n\nAs educators leave the field, new companies are even stepping up to the plate\nto help them launch their own businesses.\n\nAnd, one of those companies helping educators build tutoring businesses of\ntheir own is Clark. Megan O\u2019Connor, the Co-Founder of\n[Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/), has a plan to help 4.4 million\nunderemployed educators in the United States through her tutoring company. She\nhelps educators grow as entrepreneurs so they can attain the economic\nopportunities she believes they deserve.\n\nA snapshot of Clark's platform\n\nClark\n\nGrowing up with a single mom who worked as a middle school English and History\nteacher in San Jose, California, O'Connor realized at a young age that\nteachers were not paid fairly. Her mom worked long hours to make ends meet,\nand to provide for her family.\n\nAfter holding senior roles at education nonprofits such as Pencils of Promise,\nO'Connor co-founded Human Ventures, a startup studio in New York City. From\nthere, she was inspired to use new technology as a way to improve some of the\ntoughest problems in education. She launched Clark in 2016.\n\n[Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/) is a software that provides a way for\neducators to create their own tutoring businesses from the ground up. And, as\na result, they can potentially double their income. With Clark, educators can\nmaintain core components of their business, whether it\u2019s billing clients,\nprocessing payments, scheduling a session, or reporting on essential metrics,\nall while also providing a way for tutors to interface with parents and\nprovide feedback on student progress.\n\nMost educators know that tutoring has long been a viable solution to\nsupplement their income. However, more educators are turning this side gig\ninto a full-time alternative career. The tutoring business can keep teachers\nin the education space, where they feel they can do their best work. And, the\nmoney in tutoring is growing fast.\n\nAccording to a report by [Zion Market\nResearch](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2019/01/22/1703399/0/en/Global-Private-Tutoring-Market-Will-Reach-\nUSD-177-621-Million-By-2026-Zion-Market-Research.html) the global private\ntutoring market was valued close to $96,218 million in 2017, and is expected\nto generate about $177,621 million by 2026.\n\nClark aims to provide tutors with the resources they need to turn tutoring\ninto a full-blown business.\n\nBased on their mission, the company has raised a $3.5 million seed round from\nLightspeed Ventures Partners, Winklevoss Capital, Rethink Education,\nFoundation Capital and Human Ventures.\n\nWith her co-founder, Sam Gimbel, the company has hundreds of businesses across\nthe country using its software, and over 20,000 tutoring sessions have already\ntaken place to date.\n\nClark team members\n\nClark\n\nThis year, in an effort to recognize successful tutoring businesses on and off\nthe platform, Clark hosted their first-ever awards program for tutors. Clark\nbrought together judges from various parts of the education world.\n\nJudges included O'Connor herself, Rebecca Mieliwocki (2012 Teacher of the\nYear), Sydney Chaffee, (2017 Teacher of the Year), Jerry Huang, SVP at Rosetta\nStone, and myself.  _(Disclosure: I was a volunteer, non-paid judge)._  \n\nO'Connor states,\n\n> You\u2019ve heard of Teacher of the year, but why not Tutor of the Year? These\n> awards are about celebrating the commitments and accomplishments of\n> tutors\u2014singing the praises of the unsung heroes of our education system.\n> These educators are at the front lines, working with students who need extra\n> help, providing social and emotional support in addition to academic\n> coaching. They are helping kids reach their full potential by sticking with\n> them even after the school year comes to a close. And while recent scandals\n> may have given some tutoring practices a bad rap, these companies and\n> individuals are out there every day doing great work to make the world a\n> better place.\n\n**The Contest**\n\nIndependently owned tutoring businesses such as Evolved Education, The Ladder\nMethod, Stepping Ahead Tutoring, LLC, and Activ8 Learning Center were selected\nto participate in the contest based on their proven student outcomes and\nunique approaches to personalized learning. The winners will receive tutoring\nsessions for low-income students covered by Clark, so the educator\u2019s\nexceptional services can reach youth who need it most.\n\nO'Connor says she is committed to recognizing the best organizations in the\nspace and plans to make [The Tutor Awards](https://www.hiclark.com/blog/the-\ntutor-awards) an annual tradition.\n\nThe recipients of the Tutor Awards were judged across different categories\nthat included: best overall tutoring business, helping girls with STEM\nsubjects, best student outcomes, and tutor of the year. These categories were\nchosen because of their relevance and prominence in the 2018\u20132019 school year.\n\n**Who Won?**\n\n**Best Overall Tutoring Business**\n\nEvolved Education was named the best overall tutoring business, and the\nrunner-up was Sliding Doors STEM & Dyslexia Learning Center.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Mary Miele, Evolved Education has 72 tutors, and has served\nmore than 500 students. They have also completed more than 24,000 sessions.\nThey focus on all subject areas, test prep, executive functioning, and\nacademic coaching.\n\nAccording to their site, Sliding Doors STEM & Dyslexia Learning Center\nprovides both group tutoring in a specialized methodology designed for\nchildren with Dyslexia as well as enrichment activities in a variety of\nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (or STEM) fields.\n\n**Helping Girls With STEM Subjects**\n\nThe Ladder Method won in this category, and Highline Tutoring and Testing\nCenter was the runner-up.\n\nThe Ladder Method was founded in 2015 by Candice Lapin. They have 29 tutors,\nand have served 500 students and completed 10,000 sessions. They focus on\nsubjects including executive functioning, STEM, organization, and reading\ncomprehension.\n\nFounded in 1983 by Wendy Meyers-Wenger, Highline Tutoring and Testing Center\nhas approximately five to six tutors, has served 30 students, and completed\n280 sessions. They focus on subjects including Math, Science, Language Arts,\nstudy skills, and teacher communication.\n\n**Best Student Outcomes**\n\nThe award for best student outcomes went to Activ8 Learning Center, and the\nrunner-up is {AC-A-D\u2019AM\u2019IC} K-12 Tutoring.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Megan Becker, Activ8 Learning Center has eight tutors, has\nserved over 387 students and completed 5,600 sessions. They focus on subjects\nincluding Language Arts, Math, Science, Executive Functioning, and Spanish.\n\nAccording to their site, {AC-a-d'AM'ic} K-12 Tutoring is a boutique tutoring\ncompany that provides individualized instruction using technology and\ninnovative strategies to help improve their client's confidence in learning.\nThey cover topics for mastery in multiple areas such as math, science,\nEnglish, writing, technology, and reading.\n\n**Tutor Of The Year**\n\nThe winner for Tutor of the Year went to Loretta McDonald from Stepping Ahead\nTutoring, LLC., and the runner-up was Bright Minds Tutoring.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Loretta McDonald, Stepping Ahead Tutoring, LLC has a single\ntutor, has served four students, and completed 80 sessions. They focus on\nsubjects including LEA, Math/Phos, and Reading Comprehension/Math. Bright\nMinds Tutoring was founded in 2014 by April Coggins. They have four tutors,\nand have served hundreds of students and completed 5,460 sessions. They focus\non subjects including reading for children with Dyslexia.\n\n**Tips For Educators**\n\nO'Connor shared some entrepreneurial tips for teachers who want to get into\nentrepreneurship.\n\nShe states,\n\n> I acknowledge education is an industry with many constituents and a complex,\n> regulated ecosystem. With students, parents, teachers, administrators and\n> government officials to keep in mind, it can be easy to lose focus or get\n> pulled in different directions by different stakeholders. I advise\n> entrepreneurs not to get overwhelmed and to stay focused on your mission. At\n> the end of the day, all of these groups matter, but I believe entrepreneurs\n> should measure their success by the impact the product has on the lives of\n> students and teachers.\n\nAs a forever teacher, this is how we measure entrepreneurial success in\neducation.  [Our bottom line isn't measured by dollars, but rather by the\nlives we change every\nday.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Frobynshulman%2F2019%2F06%2F17%2Fthis-\nentrepreneur-is-empowering-educators-to-build-their-own-tutoring-\nstartups%2F&text=Our%20bottom%20line%20isn%27t%20measured%20by%20dollars%2C%20but%20rather%20by%20the%20lives%20we%20change%20every%20day.)\n\nFor more stories like this, please be sure to follow my work on\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robynshulman/) and\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobynDShulman).\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/RobynDShulman) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robynshulman/).

She's about to try\nand solve a puzzle.\n\nBefore diving into the game, she boasts with a smile: \"Well, compared to all\nyou humans, I can clear it much faster. No doubt about it!\"\n\nYes, this YouTube personality isn't a real person. While she's voiced by a\nhuman, she's a digital, anime-style cartoon. Her name is Kizuna Ai, and she\nhas more than two million subscribers to her channel. She's the most-watched\n\"virtual YouTuber\" on the site.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sq/p06msqhr.jpg)\n\nKizuna Ai is a virtual YouTuber who uploads videos like human vloggers do.\nShe's now a spokeswoman for the Japan National Tourism Organization (Credit:\nA.I.Channel)\n\n> ## One company is investing tens of millions into 'virtual talent' and\n> talent agencies are being established to manage these avatars\n\nKizuna Ai is part of an emerging trend where 3D avatars - rather than humans -\nare becoming celebrities on YouTube, with dedicated fanbases and corporate\ndeals. It's becoming so popular that one company is investing tens of millions\nin \"virtual talent\" and talent agencies are being established to manage these\navatars.\n\nIt's a movement that has big implications for the future - it could change how\nbrands market their products and how we interact with technology. It could\neven let us live forever.\n\n **They act and sound just like humans  \n**\n\nUsually, vloggers are people who speak directly into the camera to their fans,\nsharing things like beauty tips, product reviews and pop culture rants. But in\nthe past year they have had to contend with \"VTubers\" like Kizuna Ai.\n\n\"We saw this start to take off right at the end of 2017\u2026 and it's continued to\ngrow,\" says Kevin Allocca, head of culture and trends at YouTube. He points to\nKizuna Ai's channel as an example of the spike in VTuber popularity: it had\naround 200,000 subscribers last December, but well over two million just 10\nmonths later.\n\nGoogle's Earnest Pettie says the amount of daily views of VTuber videos this\nyear [is quadruple](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-\ninsights/september-youtube-video-trends/) last year's figure. And while\nthere's no easy way to measure exactly how many VTubers there are, User Local,\na Tokyo-based web analytics site, [counts at least 2,000](https://virtual-\nyoutuber.userlocal.jp/).\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sp/p06msp20.jpg)\n\nNot all virtual YouTubers are based in Japan. Bilingual Ami Yamato \"lives\" in\nLondon and interacts in the non-virtual world (Credit: Ami Yamato)\n\nThese include Nekomiya Hinata, a peach-haired character who plays combat video\ngames, sprinkling in niceties in Japanese while gunning down foes. Another,\nAmi Yamato, is a British virtual vlogger based in London who has a penchant\nfor Starbucks and strolls around in the \"real\" world, occasionally alongside\nlive humans. She's been vlogging since 2011.\n\nThis isn't yet a global trend - Allocca says VTubers are popular mostly in\nJapan. But in that country, the futuristic videos have got the attention of\ncompanies, keen to help these characters find popularity beyond YouTube.\n\n **A new industry?**\n\nGree, one of Japan's biggest mobile app developers, plans to invest 10bn yen\n($88m) over the next two years into developing virtual talent, creating more\nlive-streaming opportunities, building filming and animation studios, and\ngiving creators resources.\n\n> ## We believe that 3D avatar characters and their activities in virtual\n> worlds will take people to the next stage of the internet - Kensuke Sugiyama\n\n\"We believe that human beings need avatars beyond nicknames and profile\npictures,\" says Gree spokesman Kensuke Sugiyama. \"Although virtual talent is\ncurrently only a niche area of entertainment, we believe that attractive 3D\navatar characters and their activities in virtual worlds will take people to\nthe next stage of the internet.\"\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sp/p06msp71.jpg)\n\nVirtual YouTubers often collaborate in the same video with humans or other\nvirtual YouTubers (Credit: A.I.Channel)\n\nSugiyama says that as virtual and augmented reality technologies continue to\ndevelop, more vloggers and internet users could transform into fantastical and\ncolourful characters - which in turn could become brands themselves.\n\nIt's not just Gree, either. Kao, a Japanese cosmetics and chemicals company,\n\"hired\" VTuber Tsukino Mito at a live event in Tokyo to appear [on a washing\nmachine's smart\nscreen](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-08-04/laundry-\ndetergent-partners-with-virtual-youtuber-for-washing-machine-event/.135010) to\nsell laundry detergent. The Ibaraki prefectural government created a virtual\ninfluencer last month [to appear in tourism\ncampaigns](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/08/23/national/ibarakis-\nvirtual-youtuber-first-japan-used-promote-prefecture/#.W7OQDlJReCR), and\nKizuna Ai herself was selected [by the national tourism\nboard](https://us.jnto.go.jp/cometojapan/) to appear in videos to lure foreign\nvisitors to Japan.\n\nThis demand is driving associated industries: a talent agency in Japan\nlaunched [in April that caters exclusively to virtual\navatars](https://entum.jp/). It'll help clients organise events, video\ncollaborations with other creators and more.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\n **A star is 'born'**\n\nAn early adopter of this trend is a character that's almost 60 years old.\n\nBarbie, the doll that has appeared across toy lines and TV programmes for\ndecades, made her own virtual vlogging debut back in 2015, before the rise of\nthe Japanese VTubers.\n\n\"Hi - uh, OK, let's see, where should I start?\" Barbie says as she leans back\ninto her seat after switching on a webcam.\n\n\"My name is Barbie Roberts, I have three sisters and we live in Los Angeles -\nwell, Malibu, but I'm originally from Wisconsin. We moved here when I was\neight years old.\" She sounds and looks like many other teen vloggers on\nYouTube. She talks about everything from personal style, to more complex\ntopics like why girls say \"sorry\" so much.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sp/p06msp55.jpg)\n\nMattel's iconic Barbie character has been connecting with fans as a virtual\nYouTuber since 2015, before many Japanese VTubers became famous (Credit:\nBarbie YouTube Channel)\n\nCalifornia-based toy company Mattel, which owns the Barbie brand, noticed the\nrise in popularity of vlogging and saw an opportunity to reach kids who want\nto buy Barbie products.\n\n\"Barbie puts out two vlogs a month and it takes about four weeks for each new\nepisode,\" says Lisa McKnight, senior vice president and global general manager\nfor Barbie. \"A team develops each script based on topics that are relevant to\na girl and authentic to Barbie the character - some vlogs tackle relevant and\ncultural conversations, and some vlogs play on a YouTube trend.\"\n\nWhether it's Barbie or Kizuna Ai, many VTubers use similar technology to\ntransform a human performer into a digital influencer.\n\n **How YouTubers transform**\n\nHere's how it often works. First, an actor stands in a studio and her head,\nelbows and hands are outfitted with motion trackers. As the actor moves, her\nmotions are recorded by software that recreates full body actions from just\nthese handful of trackers. These actions are then mapped over the shape and\nproportions of an animated character, which can finally be rendered on a\nbackground or live-streamed.\n\nMeanwhile, a professional voice actor or human vlogger supplies the\ncharacter's speech.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sn/p06msncn.jpg)\n\nVirtual avatars like VTubers come alive by mixing voice actor performances and\nbody movements tracked with motion-capture technology (Credit: IKinema)\n\nThe teams behind many VTubers don't like to give away much more about how\ncharacters like Kizuna Ai come to life. In fact, sometimes the team themselves\nrefer to their creations as though the characters are real people.\n\n\"All we can say is that we met each other through destiny two years ago,\" says\nMasashi Nakano, co-founder of Tokyo-based Activ8, the digital production\ncompany that brings Kizuna Ai to life.\n\nWhile some content creators keep their process secret, other companies\nproducing similar content, like Gree, are more transparent. They're working\nwith IKinema, a UK-based animation company that provides software to clients\nin a number of fields to produce animated or virtual reality content. (For\nexample, non-VTuber actors outside and inside Japan[ are increasingly using\nthis kind of motion-capture technology as part of their\nperformances](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180611-the-durable-magic-of-\nthe-voice-actor) in film and video games.)\n\nAlexandre Pechev is CEO of IKinema. He says demand out of Japan for this kind\nof technology has dramatically increased over the past year, and that the\ncompany now works with dozens of Japanese content creators making virtual\navatars.\n\nHe says this new brand of interactive, virtual characters is new and gives\nYouTube entrepreneurs an opportunity to create content that couldn't exist on\nplatforms like TV.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sn/p06msnxt.jpg)\n\nJapanese pop culture commands massive global interest, which is slowly\nincreasing popularity in virtual YouTubers outside Japan (Credit: Getty\nImages)\n\n **How we 'll accept digital influencers**\n\nSo what's the appeal?\n\nYouTube's Allocca credits communities that build around them. We see these\naround VTubers, who often hold live chats with viewers, and fan communities on\nReddit and Wikia.\n\n\"There's a unique quality to the content that virtual YouTubers offer\u2026 it\nisn't directly tethered to the problems of a real individual or identity,\"\nsays Reddit user David Kim, who's a contributor to the Virtual YouTuber\nsubreddit. \"It's got the intrigue of character writing with the lackadaisical\nfeel of live, organic, self-driven content.\"\n\n\"I would say that the biggest contributor to the rise of virtual YouTube is\nthe huge audience outside Japan who normally have interest for Japanese media\nand culture, such as anime,\" says another fan, Kit Hakansson.\n\nThe trend within Japan of preferring digital over live-action personalities\ncan be traced back four decades, says Izumi Tsuji, a sociology and culture\nprofessor at Chuo University. Tsuji points to a famous Japanese sociologist,\nMunesuke Mita, who posited that as a result of the slowed economic growth\nfollowing the global oil crisis in the 1970s, many in the nation might have\ndeveloped a listlessness with reality that could last to this day.\n\n\"From the latter half of the 1970s, we Japanese lost a certain goal or future\nof our society,\" Tsuji says. \"We tended to love the world of fiction. From\nthis period, we tended to love enthusiastically anime, [video] games and idols\ninstead of realistic movie and music stars.\" One example of this, Tsuji says,\nis Hatsune Miku, the famous holographic pop star in Japan whose voice is\ndigitally produced.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sn/p06msngq.jpg)\n\nAkihabara, a neighbourhood in Tokyo, is the epicentre for Japan's anime and\ngaming culture that has spread all over the world and fueled VTuber popularity\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nPechev says people choose to accept virtual YouTubers at face value. When we\nmeet real people \"what we see is their personality\", he says, not the internal\nworkings. \"We accept them as real human beings. I think the same happens at\nthe moment with virtual YouTubers.\"\n\nNowadays, we're seeing more comfort in interacting with digital avatars in\nplace of people outside Japan too.\n\n> ## This is changing expectations. Our kids will be more comfortable to be\n> communicating with avatars - Alexandre Pechev\n\nCompanies cashing in on the VTuber trend follow a similar pattern to those\n[creating Instagram models to showcase various fashion\nbrands](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180402-the-fascinating-world-of-\ninstagrams-virtual-celebrities). Last year, Apple announced the Animoji\nfeature on iPhones [that scans your face to create a cartoon animal avatar\nthat uses your own facial\nexpressions](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16290210/new-iphone-emoji-\nanimated-animoji-apple-ios-11-update). IKinema's Pechev says it's a step\ntowards accepting more complex digital characters.\n\n\"This is changing expectations. Our kids will be more comfortable to be\ncommunicating with avatars,\" Pechev says. \"It will be accepted in the future\nthe same way users in Japan accept virtual YouTubers to be influential.\"\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sn/p06msnlt.jpg)\n\nCosplayers in Los Angeles at Anime Expo 2018. Companies funding VTubers hope\nthe desire to cosplay mirrors a desire to create a virtual avatar of oneself\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\n **Could they replace human YouTubers?**\n\nBut why replace human vloggers in the first place?\n\nAfter all, vlogging is one of the cheapest forms of making video - switch the\ncamera on, talk, and upload. While there might be some editing involved, it\ndoesn't involve costly effects or set design. So why replicate a talking head\nwith another - more expensive - version?\n\nIt's because the virtual character can be used at scale in ways that human\ncharacters can't: they can appear in video games and apps outside YouTube, and\nas VR and AR technology improves, they can even hold virtual reality concerts.\n(VTuber Kaguya Luna [did just that earlier this\nyear](https://youtu.be/peDh46iR3tc?t=4m24s).)\n\nAmerican comedian duo Rhett & Link published [a vlog that's been viewed 2.5\nmillion times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjCPGeq6ZU), voicing concerns\nthat virtual YouTubers could replace humans. After all, they never get tired.\nTheir appearances can be changed on a whim. They never demand payment or more\nPatreon donations.\n\n> ## We could train avatars to act like us without having to re-record our\n> movements\n\nBut never fear, humans - there are cheaper, lower-quality apps YouTubers can\nuse on their smartphones to make virtual vloggers of themselves. FaceRig, [a\ncrowdfunded facial recognition app from\nRomania](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/facerig#/), is a cheap way for\npeople to turn their facial expressions into digital cartoons and animals on\ntheir smartphone, similar to Apple's Animoji.\n\nThis autumn, Gree is releasing a live-streaming application in which users can\ncreate a VTuber of themselves on their smartphone.\n\n\"Many people have the desire to 'want to be characters',\" says Gree's\nSugiyama, pointing to the global popularity of cosplay at fan conventions. And\nVTubers' success in Japan goes deeper than fandom, Sugiyama posits. \"Japanese\nare not good at expressing themselves openly, and I think that there are many\npeople who really want to send out [their message] to the world, but do not\nwant to reveal their appearance.\"\n\nPechev wonders just how far the digitisation of ourselves could go.\n\nIf this develops in the future, he says, we could train avatars to act like us\nwithout having to re-record our movements. \"It doesn't have to do 100% of what\nwe do, or even 80%,\" he says - a character could be programmed with our voice\nand just enough of our actions, so that it could interact with friends and\nfamily after we die. \"It could interact with other virtual avatars, or real\npeople. Can we live forever?\"\n\nNakano of the Kizuna Ai team says something similar: \"We would like to create\na world just like Ready Player One,\" he says, referring to the film and novel\nset in a massive virtual dimension.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/6m/sp/p06msp96.jpg)\n\nKizuna Ai performs for fans at her birthday party in Tokyo in June (Credit:\nA.I.Channel)\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Ai-chan, as her fans call her? Nakano mentions TV adverts, a\nglobal music festival that's held online in VR and becoming a top idol in the\nvirtual world.\n\nAnd for now, you can keep up with your favourite VTuber throughout their day-\nto-day life or buy T-shirts from their merch shop.\n\nBut as Sugiyama says of the VTuber trend - that it \"will allow all human\nbeings to be released from physical constraints\" - it could be a matter of\ntime before you become one yourself.\n\n\\--\n\n _Bryan Lufkin is BBC Capital 's features writer.

She\u2019d endured more\nheartbreak when her brother, who had also been diagnosed with cancer, killed\nhimself.\n\nIf Herrod wanted to be around for her husband and two children, she\u2019d need to\nget healthy.\n\n\u201cIt actually motivated me to be healthier and more conscious. Other people\ntake their health for granted. I experienced firsthand how fast it can\nchange,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be my best and experience my life.\u201d\n\nHerrod, now 48, dropped more than 30 pounds in three months. She changed her\nphysique and started competing in bodybuilding competitions. She now leads\ncourses at Methodist Health System to teach employees how to adopt and\nmaintain healthy lifestyles, too.\n\nThe Omaha woman, who described herself as a tomboy, was all about sports\ngrowing up in Tabor, Iowa. But when she became a mom 20 years ago, she pushed\nher exercise needs aside.\n\nHerrod\u2019s life was hectic. In addition to raising two children with her\nhusband, Mike, she was attending graduate school and teaching nursing courses.\n\nHer diet suffered under the stress. Herrod ate processed foods and takeout.\nShe drank five cans of Diet Coke a day. She had regular acne breakouts and\nhigh cholesterol.\n\nHerrod said her family\u2019s health issues and their deaths lingered in the back\nof her mind as she took stock of her own health. Her mother died in 1980. That\nwas followed by the loss of her father in 2005 and her brother in 2007.\n\nHerrod said the losses fueled her \u2014 she wasn\u2019t going to put off anything until\ntomorrow.\n\nHerrod turned to an online fitness group, BuffMother, in 2008 to change her\neating and exercise habits. The forum was around before Facebook and offered a\ntransformation contest.\n\nExercise became a distraction and left her feeling positive and upbeat.\n\n\u201cIt helps me deal with the losses,\u201d Herrod said. \u201cBeing in control of my\nworkouts and being able to sculpt my body or change it has been pretty\nrewarding. It\u2019s kind of my anti-depressant.\u201d\n\nHerrod found support from other women in the group, and it was a way to track\nmeals and workouts. She called it a turning point.\n\nShe lost 35 pounds in three months and went from wearing a size 8 to a size 2.\nAt her smallest, Herrod weighed 118 pounds. She\u2019s since put on muscle through\nher workouts. Now, the 5-foot 3-inch Herrod weighs 127 pounds. She\u2019s\nmaintained that weight for eight years.\n\n\u201cThe longer you do it, you change your whole body composition,\u201d Herrod said.\n\n![Family health history drives lifestyle\ntransformation](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nBrenda Herrod performs a shoulder raise during a workout.\n\nSARAH HOFFMAN/THE WORLD-HERALD\n\nHerrod started by swapping soda for water. She steers clear of processed foods\nand foods high in sugar. Instead, she loads up on vegetables and lean protein.\nHerrod uses an app, MyFitnessPal, to track her meals, including carbs, fats\nand protein.\n\nNow, she goes to the gym five or six times a week. She focuses on lifting\nweights and upping her cardio. Herrod varies her workouts to keep things\ninteresting.\n\n\u201cI love working out. It makes me feel more alive,\u201d she said.\n\nThe online group also opened the door to bodybuilding. When Herrod\nparticipated in her first competition in 2009, she was nervous. But she felt\ngood \u2014 and the blinged out swimwear helped, too.\n\nIn eight years, she\u2019s competed in six natural figure competitions, receiving\nseveral first place awards and her pro card.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to be in that kind of shape and to know you\u2019ve pushed\nyourself and reached your goal,\u201d she said.\n\nHerrod is now a certified personal trainer and cycling instructor. She uses\nher journey to help Methodist Health System employees. Herrod leads the\nhospital\u2019s Better Living program, which teaches employees how to adopt a\nhealthy lifestyle.\n\nDani Sexton, a certified nursing assistant at Methodist Women\u2019s Hospital, lost\nmore than 30 pounds in the program. When she joined, she had given birth to\nher third child and was at her heaviest.\n\nThe first time she met Herrod, she was intimidated and self-conscious. But she\ncould tell Herrod had a positive attitude and was passionate about helping\nothers get healthy.\n\n\u201cI felt completely comfortable with her. I remember when I left thinking,\n\u2018This woman is going to change my life.\u2019 And she did,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cYou just\nrealized she was a real person and had been where we were once.\u201d\n\nGroup interaction proved to be key to Herrod\u2019s lifestyle changes, and it\u2019s\nsomething she emphasizes with program members like Sexton.\n\n\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t see (the changes) yourself, but when you get the support\nof other people, it can make a difference. It makes you feel better,\u201d Herrod\nsaid.\n\n _[kelsey.stewart@owh.com](mailto:kelsey.stewart@owh.com), 402-444-3100,\n[twitter.com/kels2](http://twitter.com/kels2)_\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaha.com%2Flivewellnebraska%2Finspiration%2F3-family-deaths-motivate-omaha-woman-to-drop-5-diet-cokes-a-day-habit-start%2Farticle_56cbc380-78be-5fc2-aca9-b3bf77ed23c2.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=3%20family%20deaths%20motivate%20Omaha%20woman%20to%20drop%205-Diet-Cokes-a-day%20habit%2C%20start%20exercising.%20Now%20she%27s%20ripped&via=owhnews&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaha.com%2Flivewellnebraska%2Finspiration%2F3-family-deaths-motivate-omaha-woman-to-drop-5-diet-cokes-a-day-habit-start%2Farticle_56cbc380-78be-5fc2-aca9-b3bf77ed23c2.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Tweet\")\n  * [ __ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://www.omaha.com/livewellnebraska/inspiration/3-family-deaths-motivate-omaha-woman-to-drop-5-diet-cokes-a-day-habit-start/article_56cbc380-78be-5fc2-aca9-b3bf77ed23c2.html \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ __ SMS ](sms:?body=Check%20out%20this%20link:%20www.omaha.com/tncms/asset/editorial/56cbc380-78be-5fc2-aca9-b3bf77ed23c2 \"SMS\")\n  * [ __ Email ](mailto:?subject=%5BOmaha%20World-Herald%5D%203%20family%20deaths%20motivate%20Omaha%20woman%20to%20drop%205-Diet-Cokes-a-day%20habit%2C%20start%20exercising.%20Now%20she%27s%20ripped&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaha.com%2Flivewellnebraska%2Finspiration%2F3-family-deaths-motivate-omaha-woman-to-drop-5-diet-cokes-a-day-habit-start%2Farticle_56cbc380-78be-5fc2-aca9-b3bf77ed23c2.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\n#### Who inspires you?\n\nReal People, Real Inspiration is a series about local people and their\njourneys to better health.

* *\n\nIn a bid to save money on his electricity bills Kilkenny dairy farmer Cathal\nMoran recently took the innovative step to install a 10kWp solar installation\n\nThe project was developed by Elgin Energy in partnership with Activ8 Solar\nEnergies and it is the first time such a project and structure has been\ninstalled on an Irish farm.\n\nThe project was installed in a single day and will produce up to 9,000kWh of\nelectricity per annum \u2013 that\u2019s enough to power two homes for an entire year.\n\nThe structure consists of a simple lightweight steel frame driven into the\nground with no concrete being poured.\n\n__![](https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6bb8e/37063393.ece/AUTOCROP/w300/Kilkenny%20solar%202.JPG)\n_Expand_\n\n[Close](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n__![](https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6bb8e/37063393.ece/AUTOCROP/w300/Kilkenny%20solar%202.JPG)\n\n****/\n\n

Planning exemptions for small scale solar installations\nand the ability to sell excess energy to the grid are crucial in assisting\nadoption of solar across Irish farms.\n\n\u201cFarming is the backbone of Ireland and this challenging industry requires\nsupport to adopt improved sustainable practices.

Melbourne cloud start-up Sinefa raises $5m in Regal-led round that avoided\nVC\n\n **[Yolanda Redrup](/by/yolanda-redrup-j7gdq)** and **[Sarah\nThompson](/by/sarah-thompson-j7ger)**\n\nMay 7, 2018

article\n\nShare\n\nInstitutional investors, including Regal Funds Management, have poured money\ninto Melbourne-based cloud computing start-up Sinefa, which has raised $5\nmillion to help fund local and US expansion plans.\n\nSinefa was founded in 2011 by second-time entrepreneurs Con Nikolouzakis and\nChris Siakos, and has a product that lets customers like Telstra and 7-Eleven\nmonitor traffic on their networks, giving them real-time insights into their\nonline usage and enabling them to optimise their performance.\n\nThe co-founders had previously started network hardware company Exinda\nNetworks in 2001, which grew to $35 million in revenue prior to its [sale to\nUS-based GFI Software last\nyear](https://www.gfi.com/company/press/2017/04/gfi-software-acquires-exinda-\nand-brings-more-powerful-network-management-products-to-the-gfi-family).\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nSinefa co-founder Con Nikolouzakis said the capital raised from Regal Funds\nManagement would be split between supporting the growth of its US office and\nlocal team.  Simon Schluter\n\nThey said they had targeted institutional investors rather than venture\ncapital funds, as they wanted the money to come with less hands-on\ninvolvement.\n\nAfter spending three years building Sinefa's cloud-based technology, it has\nenterprise customers in 20 countries and has opened an office in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Funds needed\n\nThe capital raising, [which was first flagged by _Street\nTalk_](http://www.afr.com/street-talk/sinefa-reaches-for-the-cloud-\nand-8m-20180405-h0ycv2), was conducted with the help of investment and\nadvisory business Activ8 Capital, with Regal the cornerstone investor through\nits second emerging companies fund.\n\nIt had originally considered raising up to $8 million, but scaled it back to\n$5 million on advice from prospective investors that it had overestimated how\nmany staff members it would need to hire to fund its expansion plans.\n\nMr Nikolouzakis said the capital raised would be split evenly between\nsupporting the growth of its US office and local team.\n\n\"We wanted to build a solution with instant gratification, where people are\nable to see how their network was being utilised in an instant,\" he said.\n\n\"We acquired 7-Eleven as a customer late last year, and they said the base\nnetwork architecture had become very important, because they have to\nunderstand what services customers are engaging with.\n\n\"Previously it had a 24-hour turnaround on this level of reporting, now they\nget it in seconds or minutes.\"\n\n## Lots of investment options\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegal has $1.8 billion under management and its portfolio manager Julian\nBabarczy told _The Australian Financial Review_ Sinefa was one of a small\ngroup of early stage companies that stood out from the large number vying for\nfunding.\n\nHe said it had developed a truly differentiated product, which gave clients a\nmuch more accurate and useful view of their networks than anything else\navailable. This meant Regal would also support Sinefa in any follow-on capital\nraises, including if it goes public.\n\n\"Since the start of this calendar year, we have been reviewing an\nextraordinary number of potential investment opportunities, both domestically\nand internationally,\" Mr Babarczy said.\n\n\"Given the growth we expect from Sinefa, we anticipate a follow-on funding\nround within 12 months, and depending on the scale of that growth, this could\npotentially be an IPO.\"\n\n## Previous funding\n\nPrior to this Series A round, the company had raised $5.5 million, some of\nwhich came directly from its co-founders.\n\nIt decided to approach institutional investors, rather than venture capital\nfunds, because the company wanted backers who would not be too involved in the\nday-to-day operations of the firm.\n\nBut for future raises, it will consider approaching VCs, as well as weighing\nup an IPO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We decided to have two or three institutions in the books, rather than a big\nVC partner that wants to impact the outcome of the company and wants a board\nseat,\" Mr Nikolouzakis said.\n\nLast year, Sinefa recorded $1.38 million in revenue and $2.45 million in\nsales. For the 2018 calendar year, it has forecast $5.8 million in sales.\n\n## Growth plan\n\nIn the next 12 months, it is focused on establishing itself in the US, as well\nas setting up relationships with channel partners such as major telcos and\nmanaged services providers.\n\nIts main competitors are incumbent players such as NetScout, which is listed\non the NASDAQ and valued at $US2.3 billion ($3.1 billion), and SolarWinds.\n\n\"They're both listed US companies with hundreds of millions in revenue, but\nthey do things the old way and provide these heavy-lifting enterprise tools,\nbut we're a cloud-based service delivering on an annual subscription that's\neasy to use,\" Mr Nikolouzakis said.\n\n\"I give people the example of Xero. They came into a saturated market with a\nwell-established player and disrupted it by offering a software-as-a-service\nmodel that's easy to use, and that's what we're doing but at the enterprise\nlevel.\"\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\n[License\narticle](http://rightsportal.copyright.com.au/pages/republicationpage.aspx?author=Yolanda%20Redrup%20and%20Sarah%20Thompson&publication=AFR&publicationdate=2018-05-07T01%3A00%3A00Z&publisher=fxj&title=Melbourne%20cloud%20start-\nup%20Sinefa%20raises%20%245m%20in%20Regal-\nled%20round%20that%20avoided%20VC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Ftechnology%2Fmelbourne-\ncloud-startup-sinefa-raises-5m-in-regalled-round-that-avoided-\nvc-20180502-h0zjut)\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [Start-ups](/topic/start-ups-629)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Innovation](/topic/innovation-5yn)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Cloud](/topic/cloud-computing-5vq)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n **[Yolanda Redrup](/by/yolanda-redrup-j7gdq)** writes on technology from our\nMelbourne newsroom.

* *\n\nBottom line operating profit at SSE Airtricity owner SSE has fallen by 28.9pc\nyear-on-year to \u00a31.4bn (\u20ac1.6bn) amid what the company chairman described as \"a\nnumber of complex challenges.\"\n\nIn the 12 months to 31 March the group adjusted reported operating profit of\n\u00a31.8bn, a decline of 2.4pc year-on-year.\n\nDuring the period the group incurred exceptional charges of \u00a3213m, according\nto the company's results announcement.\n\nRevenue increased 8pc to \u00a331.23bn, however reported earnings per share were\ndown 48.7pc to 81.3p.\n\nDuring the 12 month period the group, which operates in Ireland and the UK,\nlost 430,000 customers and was impacted by charges linked to the merger of its\nretail arm with Npower.\n\n  * __****__\n\n\"As expected, 2017/18 presented a number of complex challenges to manage, but\nSSE's operational performance was generally very robust and significant\nprogress was achieved in key aspects of the company's capital investment\nprogramme,\" Richard Gillingwater, chairman of SSE, said.\n\n\"The challenges will continue in 2018/19, which is also expected to be a year\nof major transition for SSE.\"\n\n\"A strong operational and investment focus on meeting the current and future\nneeds of energy customers is essential, as is preparing the businesses in the\nSSE group for the changes that lie ahead.\"\n\nIn its 2017/18 financial year the company paid \u20ac22.6m of taxes in Ireland,\ncompared to \u20ac16.5m the previous year.\n\nThis year marks ten years since SSE's acquisition of Airtricity, during which\nperiod the company has worked on developing strengths in the efficient\ndevelopment, construction and operation of onshore wind.\n\nIn the last 16 months the company has delivered seven new onshore wind energy\nprojects across Ireland and the UK, including Leanamore (18MW) in Ireland.\n\nAt 31 March 2018, SSE Airtricity supplied electricity and natural gas to\n740,000 household and
