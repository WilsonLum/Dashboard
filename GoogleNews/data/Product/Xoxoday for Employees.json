Gamified solutions are used to motivate\nand improve the productivity of trainers as well as of students excitingly and\ninnovatively by providing leader boards, earned badges, point collections, and\nmilestone achievement, among others. Gamification helps people have fun-loving\ntraining sessions that can be provided for academic education as well as for\ncorporate training in organizations. Organizations can use gamification to\nboost their employee onboarding process and their learning and development\nthroughout their career.\n\n _ **SMEs segment to record a higher market share in 2020**_\n\nThe rising usage of cloud for the deployment of gamification solutions has led\nto the increasing adoption of these solutions among Small and Medium-sized\nEnterprises (SMEs).

However, the availability of these solutions on the cloud\nhas reduced this problem of cost as cloud-based solutions are less expensive\ncompared to the on-premises solutions. SMEs have to focus on their budget\nconstraints; so, they prefer cloud-based solutions available in the market.\nThe SME criteria may also be based upon various metrics such as revenue\ngenerated and ownership structure. These organizations have one or more full-\ntime employees dedicated to managing their data and IT infrastructure.

Organizations\nare demanding enterprise- and consumer-based gamification solutions to\nencourage employees and strengthen their marketing endeavors. However, these\nsolutions are high in cost and offer limited scalability. This helps companies\nto adopt cloud-based gamification solutions. These cloud-based solutions\ndeliver all the benefits at a condensed price as it does not involve a high\nupfront cost. Moreover, these cloud-based services include reduced licensing\ncosts, the ability to cut out unnecessary Information Technology (IT) staff,\nfocus on maintenance, and flexibility in the expansion of businesses. However,\nto implement cloud model deployment, enterprises need to analyze the benefits\nof their existing set-up as well as those that a cloud-based service can give\nthem.\n\nStory continues\n\n _ **North America to record the highest market share in the gamification\nmarket in 2020**_\n\nThe North America region has been a predominately receptive market toward the\nadoption of gamification solutions. There has been an extensive usage of the\ninternet to connect with various channel partners and clients among\nenterprises. The high adoption of customer-based solutions and enterprise-\nbased solutions are driving the gamification market in North America.\nMoreover, in this region, countries such as the US and Canada are adopting\ngamification solutions to enrich their marketing activities with better\nadvertising, customer interaction, and branding and selling. Furthermore, the\nrising demand for cloud-based gamified solutions among enterprises due to its\nlow implementation cost has helped the gamification market to grow at a\nsignificant pace. Presently, the gamification market in North America is\ncontributing a large portion of revenue as compared to the other regions.\n\n **Research Coverage**\n\nThe market study covers the gamification market across different segments.

End-User\n(Enterprise-Driven and Consumer-Driven), Vertical, and Region - Global\nForecast

has been added to **ResearchAndMarkets.com's** offering.\n\n  \n  \nThe global gamification market is expected to grow from USD 9,142 million in\n2020 to USD 30,741 million by 2025, at a CAGR of 27.4% during the forecast\nperiod of 2020-2025.  \n\n _ **The growing need to drive employee engagement via offering rewards and\nrecognition drives the market**_  \n  \nGamification is acting as an increasing trend of employee engagement that\nhelps employees reach specific goals and objectives. The employee plays a game\nthat offers points, status, and rewards with improving the skills and\nachieving goals or objectives of the company.\n\nGamification provides rewards and recognition to the employees in the\norganization, makes them visible in the organization network, and boosts their\nconfidence. The major factors driving the growth of the gamification market\ninclude rewards and recognition to employees over performance to boost\nemployee engagement, provision of lucrative offers to the customers and\nconsumers, and gamification yielding higher Return on Investment (RoI).  \n  \n_**Education segment to hold the largest market share during the forecast\nperiod**_  \n  \nBased on vertical, the education segment of the gamification market is\nprojected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period.\n\nThe education sector is becoming one of the fastest technology adopting\nindustries and has shown wide adoption of gamification solutions in learning.\nThis sector is implementing advanced technologies to provide better facilities\nin Learning Management System/Learning Content Management System (LMS/LCMS),\nStudent Information System (SIS), test and assessment, collaboration, and\neContent. This sector is substantially adopting gamification techniques to\nmake education and learning more effective.\n\nGamified solutions are used to motivate and improve the productivity of\ntrainers as well as of students excitingly and innovatively by providing\nleader boards, earned badges, point collections, and milestone achievement,\namong others. Gamification helps people have fun-loving training sessions that\ncan be provided for academic education as well as for corporate training in\norganizations. Organizations can use gamification to boost their employee\nonboarding process and their learning and development throughout their career.  \n  \n _ **SMEs segment to record a higher market share in 2020**_  \n  \nThe rising usage of cloud for the deployment of gamification solutions has led\nto the increasing adoption of these solutions among Small and Medium-sized\nEnterprises (SMEs). The gamification solutions are high in cost and are\ninvolved in nature. However, the availability of these solutions on the cloud\nhas reduced this problem of cost as cloud-based solutions are less expensive\ncompared to the on-premises solutions.\n\nSMEs have to focus on their budget constraints; so, they prefer cloud-based\nsolutions available in the market. The SME criteria may also be based upon\nvarious metrics such as revenue generated and ownership structure. These\norganizations have one or more full-time employees dedicated to managing their\ndata and IT infrastructure. Cloud-based solutions are developed, keeping in\nmind the limited budget of SMEs.  \n  \n _ **Cloud segment to hold more significant market share during the forecast\nperiod**_  \n  \nThe increasing usage of the internet, along with the high adoption of\ninnovative technologies such as web, mobile, and social media, has\nsupplemented the growth of cloud-based gamification techniques. Organizations\nare demanding enterprise- and consumer-based gamification solutions to\nencourage employees and strengthen their marketing endeavors.\n\nHowever, these solutions are high in cost and offer limited scalability. This\nhelps companies to adopt cloud-based gamification solutions. These cloud-based\nsolutions deliver all the benefits at a condensed price as it does not involve\na high upfront cost.  \n\nMoreover, these cloud-based services include reduced licensing costs, the\nability to cut out unnecessary Information Technology (IT) staff, focus on\nmaintenance, and flexibility in the expansion of businesses. However, to\nimplement cloud model deployment, enterprises need to analyze the benefits of\ntheir existing set-up as well as those that a cloud-based service can give\nthem.  \n  \n _ **North America to record the highest market share in the gamification\nmarket in 2020**_  \n  \nThe North America region has been a predominately receptive market toward the\nadoption of gamification solutions. There has been an extensive usage of the\ninternet to connect with various channel partners and clients among\nenterprises. The high adoption of customer-based solutions and enterprise-\nbased solutions are driving the gamification market in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in this region, countries such as the US and Canada are adopting\ngamification solutions to enrich their marketing activities with better\nadvertising, customer interaction, and branding and selling. Furthermore, the\nrising demand for cloud-based gamified solutions among enterprises due to its\nlow implementation cost has helped the gamification market to grow at a\nsignificant pace. Presently, the gamification market in North America is\ncontributing a large portion of revenue as compared to the other regions.  \n  \n **Research Coverage**\n\nThe market study covers the gamification market across different segments.

The employee plays a game\nthat offers points, status, and rewards with improving the skills and\nachieving goals or objectives of the company.\n\nGamification provides rewards and recognition to the employees in the\norganization, makes them visible in the organization network, and boosts their\nconfidence. The major factors driving the growth of the gamification market\ninclude rewards and recognition to employees over performance to boost\nemployee engagement, provision of lucrative offers to the customers and\nconsumers, and gamification yielding higher Return on Investment (RoI).  \n  \n_**Education segment to hold the largest market share during the forecast\nperiod**_  \n  \nBased on vertical, the education segment of the gamification market is\nprojected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period.\n\nThe education sector is becoming one of the fastest technology adopting\nindustries and has shown wide adoption of gamification solutions in learning.\nThis sector is implementing advanced technologies to provide better facilities\nin Learning Management System/Learning Content Management System (LMS/LCMS),\nStudent Information System (SIS), test and assessment, collaboration, and\neContent. This sector is substantially adopting gamification techniques to\nmake education and learning more effective.\n\nGamified solutions are used to motivate and improve the productivity of\ntrainers as well as of students excitingly and innovatively by providing\nleader boards, earned badges, point collections, and milestone achievement,\namong others. Gamification helps people have fun-loving training sessions that\ncan be provided for academic education as well as for corporate training in\norganizations. Organizations can use gamification to boost their employee\nonboarding process and their learning and development throughout their career.  \n  \n _ **SMEs segment to record a higher market share in 2020**_  \n  \nThe rising usage of cloud for the deployment of gamification solutions has led\nto the increasing adoption of these solutions among Small and Medium-sized\nEnterprises (SMEs). The gamification solutions are high in cost and are\ninvolved in nature. However, the availability of these solutions on the cloud\nhas reduced this problem of cost as cloud-based solutions are less expensive\ncompared to the on-premises solutions.\n\nSMEs have to focus on their budget constraints; so, they prefer cloud-based\nsolutions available in the market.

Post-2009\ndepression, retailers have thrived and managed to hold their ground, but their\nemployee recruiting and retention strategy is still struggling to get out of\nthat phase. Even though they have several positions open throughout the year,\nit's almost impossible to have 100 percent successful hiring. This explains\nwhy retail stands among the [top five](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-\nsolutions/blog/trends-and-research/2018/the-3-industries-with-the-highest-\nturnover-rates) industries with the highest employee turnover rate. Apart from\nemployee acquisition, retailers have a much bigger problem: employee\nretention.\n\n## Rewards and Recognition is the Answer\n\nThe first step to [employee\nretention](https://blog.xoxoday.com/employeeretention/16033?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers)\nis [rewards and\nrecognition](https://www.xoxoday.com/rewards/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers)\n(R&R). While salary is the primary motivator for an employee to work, praise,\nappreciation and recognition also go a long way in keeping employees happy and\nreturning to work every day with a smile on their face. R&R can improve your\nbusiness by:\n\n  * improving worker productivity;\n  * reducing absenteeism;\n  * creating a highly motivated staff;\n  * instilling employee trust and loyalty; and\n  * improving [peer-to-peer](https://blog.xoxoday.com/peer-recognition/16115?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers) relationships.\n\nRetailers that have a well-curated R&R program experience less employee\nturnover and provide better customer service leading to increased sales.\n\n## Rules to Follow Before Rolling Out a R&R Program\n\n  * **Be regular.  **Recognition shouldn't occur periodically, apart from annual performance reviews or award ceremonies. Employees' everyday efforts add to bigger results. Hence, it's imperative that you recognize the hard work they put in on an everyday basis.\n  * **Be immediate.  **Whenever you see a behavior, effort or result that's appreciation worthy, recognize it immediately. We all know that what gets recognized gets repeated.\n  * **Be genuine.  **Saying \"thank you\" or \"good job\" isn't enough. It's too ambiguous for employees as they're not sure for what exactly they're being thanked or appreciated for. Remember to specify the [behavior](https://blog.xoxoday.com/10-employee-behaviours-that-need-to-be-recognised/13217?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers), effort or result you're rewarding (or recognizing) and the impact it will have on the team/organization.\n  * **Be considerate.  **No one shoe size fits all. Therefore, you should also consider personalizing your recognition. Something that can be encouraging to one may not be encouraging for another. For example, introverts don't enjoy the spotlight, while extroverts enjoy being celebrated. Therefore, be sensitive and [considerate](https://blog.xoxoday.com/a-to-z-of-rewards-recognition/16249?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers) to the way an individual likes to be recognized.\n\n## 5 Easy and Empowering Ways to Rock Recognition\n\n  1. **Say thanks.**  Daily verbal recognition boosts employees' confidence and motivates them to work harder.\n  2. **Give a little.**  Not all of us can afford to sponsor fancy vacations for employees who go above and beyond. However, that should not stop us from giving [gift cards](https://www.xoxoday.com/rewards-gift-vouchers/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers), movie tickets, [experience vouchers](https://www.xoxoday.com/rewards-experience-activities/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers), sports event tickets, etc., to those employees who matter to your company the most.\n  3. **Celebrate milestones.**  Organize team lunches or off-site outings to recognize the completion of sales targets or projects. This will boost team morale and increase teamwork.\n  4. **Present advancement opportunities.**  Take time to map a career path plan with each employee so they can understand their future within your department/company.\n  5. **Offer monetary rewards.**  If [budget](https://www.xoxoday.com/motivation-budgeting/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers) permits, consider spot bonuses for incredible contributions.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nGenuine recognition is an essential driver for any successful business. If you\ncontinue to ignore the benefit of an effective R&R program, then your company\nwill continue the cycle of turnover. You will incur costs by having key roles\nconstantly being open and filled. These employees may be \"OK,\" but they're not\ndelivering the greatness your brand, peers and customers need.\n\n_Poonam Das is a content writer\nat[Xoxoday](https://www.xoxoday.com/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers),\na Saas commerce company that helps build an engaged and happy workforce._\n\nRelated story: [How to Attract and Retain Gen Z Talent in a Tight Labor\nMarket](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/how-to-attract-and-retain-gen-z-\ntalent-in-a-tight-labor-market/)\n\n##\n\n[0 Comments](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/rewards-and-recognition-\neffective-solutions-for-employee-engagement-in-the-retail-sector/#respond)\n\nView Comments\n\n![](https://www.mytotalretail.com/thumb/?src=/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/14/2019/09/Poonam-Das.jpg&w=51&h=51&c=true)\n\n**Poonam Das** [Author's\npage](https://www.mytotalretail.com/author/poonamdas/)\n\nPoonam Das is a content writer at\n[Xoxoday](https://www.xoxoday.com/?utm_source=total_retail&utm_medium=RandR_for_retailers),\na Saas commerce company that helps build an engaged and happy workforce.

He introduces innovative methods to facilitate team\nbonding and assimilation. Abhishek also speaks about why he believes a\npersonal touch in communication is never going out of fashion, despite\nadvancements in AI and Machine Learning._**\n\n_**Tell us a little about Xoxoday and how it helps CHROs in enhancing the\nEmployee Engagement at their organization.**_\n\nXoxoday provides technology solutions and tools to small, medium and large\nenterprises which help in engagement, reward & recognition for their\nEmployees/Channel Partners/Customers; to influence positive behavior which\ndelivers business value to the organizations. Xoxoday is also a consumer\nplatform which enables hosting of authentic experiences and makes them\navailable for guests to explore and book via the website or mobile app.\nXoxoday works with over 1000 hosts globally from a wide range of experiences.\nWith this unparalleled catalogue of experience Xoxoday assists 800+\nenterprises to manage their R\u2019n\u2019R (Rewards & Recognition) and customer loyalty\nprograms.\n\n_**A normal employee life cycle consists of a lot of highlights and\nachievements (work anniversaries, successful projects etc.). How should CHROs\nensure that these highlights are celebrated and rewarded well?**_\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nEmployee life cycle encompasses various stages in the career of an employee,\nbeginning with recruitment and concluding with resignation, termination or\nretirement. Shared above is a pictorial representation of a rewards cycle\nwhich improves the productivity and efficiency of the employees, reduces the\ncost of hiring and [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)rate, and, which provides better ROI for HR\ninvestments.\n\n_**What are some extremely novel and interesting ways of rewarding employees\nfor their achievements, without directly offering a monetary compensation?**_\n\n**a) Make your workplace interesting or lively** \u2013 This will be the best\nstrategy for retention **.** Smart, ambitious people need mental stimulation.\nIf they feel their workplace is stagnant they will get distracted and perhaps\nsearch for better opportunities. People who are willing to grow will always\nlook forward to challenges at work and learning __. Giving them the right\nguidance from your most experienced leaders and mentors will showcase their\ncareer path in the organization.\n\n**b) Identifying talents (recognition)** \u2013 Appreciation in public is always\nthe best method in boosting one\u2019s morale. People always want to get\nappreciated for their work contributions or accomplishments or in meeting the\ndeadlines. They are always eager to know which individual is important for the\norganization. Public recognition through awards and acknowledgement helps them\nunderstand that they are valued on the team. It is easy to send a brief thank\nyou email or mention their names at a weekly meeting with a personal comment\non their accomplishment and why it matters. A public awards wall with\nnoticeable achievements acts as a reward for those who excel and motivates\nthose who are looking to be recognized.\n\n**c) Empowerment** \\- Empower your best employees so they can act on their\nown. Create ways for your people to test their skills safely, without\nthreatening the team or company's prospects. This will relieve you of the\npressure to come to the rescue and short circuit the process.\n\n**d) Having lunch with the boss/ coffee with the manager.**\n\n**e) Hand written note to the families of employees on special occasions.**\n\n**f) Team birthdays and work anniversaries**\n\n**g) Open a platform for innovations and reward the ideas.**\n\n_**Bonding with your co-workers is a very significant component of employee\nretention and work satisfaction. How can CHROs facilitate team assimilation\nexercises/activities?**_\n\n  * **Open communication/ Town hall meeting** \\- Emphasize the importance of each team member's contribution and demonstrate how all of their jobs operate together to move the entire team closer to its goal.\n\n  * \u00b7 **Provide Company Sponsorship for Sports Teams and Get Fit-** A mid-sized company can sponsor sports teams for employees that include baseball, golf, basketball, bowling, TT, and, more.\n\n> **The company can pay employee registration fees for running and walking\n> events, especially those where the proceeds are shared with local\n> charities.**\n\n  * **Schedule Team Building Lunch-and-Learns -** Get an outside speaker or an employee with a hobby, interest, or a particular field of knowledge or skill to meet with a group of employees to share the information and the experiences. The employees bring their own lunches and the speakers are encouraged to make their sessions interactive to encourage team building. The shared interest in the topic encourages team building, as does the interaction.  \n  \n **a)** **Fun Classes and Events On-site -** You can provide fun classes that\nemployees and their families can attend after work or on weekends. They\npromote both family and employee engagement.  \n  \n **b) Promote Employee Hobby Clubs-** Employees might share interests in\nvarious outside-of-work activities. Provide the space, email lists, and\noccasional financial support to promote hobby group meetings at work.\nCompanies have sponsored photography clubs, internet game playing groups,\nknitting clubs, and shooting interest groups. Team building activities in this\narea are unlimited.\n\n**_How do you set yourself apart from other businesses in your industry?_**\n\nWe use AI and predictive analysis, combined with behavioral analysis that\nhelps CHROs to stay ahead of their employees. We deploy just the right amount\nof technology to automate HR processes and, our unparalleled catalogue of\nexperiences and vouchers helps us outshine our competition.\n\n_**A founder of an SMB company that can\u2019t afford any HR personnel comes to you\nlooking for advice because he\u2019s struggling to keep his team motivated and\nfocused on growing the company. What\u2019s the best advice you would give him?**_\n\nIt starts with understanding the value of having a great culture and defining\nwhat it looks like for your company. Establish the following from day one for\nyour company:\n\n  * Mission\n  * Vision\n  * Values\n  * Practices\n\n> **A culture alongside the purpose and mission is one of the most important\n> assets of any organization from an employee engagement perspective and costs\n> little or no money.**\n\nIt gives the team a clear sense of direction, and, sends a message across of\nwhy you are here in the first place. It helps start a dialogue with the team\nand connect with them at a higher level.\n\nTo motivate the team, take them to out for a team outing /dinner to celebrate\ntheir achievements. Incentivize all business targets to keep them competitive\nand motivated enough.\n\n_**Artificial intelligence is a buzzword in HR, and you being at the\nintersection of technology and HR, how do you look to Artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning, etc.?**_\n\n**Artificial Intelligence** is an exciting advancement that promises to make\nday-to-day life of HR personnel much easier. HR departments are inundated with\nquestions from employees. A significant number of these questions can be\nanswered using **Artificial Intelligence __**. By programming automated email\nor instant messaging replies to common questions, the workload of HR\ndepartments can be reduced. This frees up HR personnel to answer more complex\nquestions and engage more effectively with a company\u2019s employees.\nAdditionally, AI could soon play a role in other more mundane HR tasks.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence will be beneficial for HR in terms of helping\nwith record keeping and dealing with tasks that can be automated, it will\nnever replace people as no amount of technology can replace the simple comfort\nand reassurance that comes from speaking to another human being who cares.\n\n_**What skills are most useful for everyone to have when trying to move\ntowards a culture of engagement?**_\n\nThe most important skill is building trust, and, honesty. You actually have to\ntrust what other people are saying and doing if you\u2019re going to have a culture\nof engagement. You also have to trust and be honest with feedback, and,\ncommunicate personally. If your communication isn\u2019t relevant to that person\u2019s\njob, it\u2019s not going to be as valuable.\n\n> **So, if you\u2019re an honest person, a succinct communicator and you\u2019re willing\n> to do targeted sharing authentically, you will start moving towards a\n> culture of engagement by building transparency within the team and gaining\n> trust.**\n\n_**What questions are your buyers asking you? How is that impacting your\nplatform\u2019s roadmap? Are there any new features or upcoming upgrades that\nyou\u2019re excited about and would like to give us a sneak peek into?**_\n\nOne question that we often get from buyers is about measuring and improving\nemployee engagement. Employer\u2019s understanding of employee engagement and\nhappiness is rudimentary and based on unstructured interactions and data. A\nlot of our forward-thinking clients want a deeper understanding of the reasons\nbehind higher employee engagement __. We are working on a solution which will\nhelp employers do both things - measure the organization-wide status of\nemployee engagement and secondly, offer remedial steps for areas of\nimprovement as measured in the first step. We are confident that this feature\nwould be a strong value addition for mid-sized to large-sized organizations,\nand, will help them become more proactive in dealing with employee engagement\nissues instead of being reactive.\n\n_**About Xoxoday:**_\n\nXoxoday is in the space of democratizing the last mile activity and\nexperiences.

The post covers a few of the most awe-inspiring\nones**_\n\nAs human beings, each of us is uniquely different. This makes people\nmanagement one of the most complex functions in the world. In a professional\ncontext, human dimensions like gender, education, geography, age groups, and\nskill sets add further intrication. While organizations attempt to manually\ntackle people management with a handful of HRs, they end up further knotting\nup this already entwined process.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe good news is that technology is best in solving such complex scaling up\nproblems. Today - with the advent of AI, Machine learning and lightweight\napplications- technology can be used to deeply understand every employee\u2019s\naspirations and grievances without having to build a large HR team. The data\nand analytics from these products can provide the management dynamic and\ninvaluable insights to frame proactive people policies.\n\nThis way, technology can help drive organizational changes organically and\nseamlessly through the fabric of the organization. Seems utopian, but\nglobally, many organizations are already in the process of approaching this\npinnacle.\n\nSince the turn of the century, analysts across the world have been fantasizing\nabout this concept of the \u2018firm of the future\u2019 and dissecting it to help\norganizations get ready for it. Yet, the change did come crashing upon\norganizations who were fencing it - with the sudden upsurge in applications of\ntechnology in business. Today, the need to digitize the workplace is a\ngrappling requirement for firms to survive the labor and user markets.\n\nTechnology has caused significant disruption in people management and\n[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/) a whole. Below are a few of the most\nawe-inspiring ones:\n\n## 1\\. Recruitment: Age of the Human Bot\n\nArtificial Intelligence has extensive applications in the recruitment process\nand the candidate experience. The very iterative recruitment screening\nprocesses are now being taken over by AI. Smashfly, for instance, provides a\npersonalized and extremely human-like interaction with prospective candidates.\nEmerson, Smashfly\u2019s AI, sends follow-ups and reminders to the candidate - more\nefficiently and accurately than even _human_ HR personnel. These help each\nprospective employee to feel that the company is keen on their candidature and\nthat they are highly valued.\n\nSimilarly, Tech Mahindra has an AI-enabled talent marketplace and this AI has\nbeen taught to nudge dormant talent on the company\u2019s opportunities. These\njudges will be customized as per the unique strengths and career interests of\nthe candidates. These machines are ensuring that not only are active\ncandidates appeased, but also are the latent prospects.\n\n## 2\\. Learning and Development: on-demand and dynamic\n\nTechnology has transformed the learning and upskilling process of employees\ndrastically. The marketplace format of learning is being used by online\nlearning platforms, like Udemy and Cousera. These help in developing a dynamic\nlearning environment in organizations by making the learning \u2018on-demand\u2019. The\ndigital learning platforms are also using gamification- the use of e-badges,\nsocial leaderboards, etc - to achieve momentum in their learning initiatives.\nThis has helped employees to experience learning more as an organic process\nthan as a prescribed one.\n\nFor the manufacturing segment, demonstrative learning and simulations take an\nupper hand. Augmented Reality elegantly fits itself into this purpose by\nproviding real-time instructions and helping to expedite on-the-job training.\nGE Healthcare, recently had a fantastic case of using Augmented Reality for\ntheir OTJ training. They let a batch of new trainee workers perform an\nassembly operation and they completed it 46% faster than their standard\nassembly time on their very first trial. They did this by using smart glasses\nthat overlayed augmented instructions to the assembly that even included\nvisualization of the steps.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Train New Employees: 5 Steps for\nPlanning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/how-to-train-new-employees-steps-for-success/)**\n\n## 3\\. HR helpdesk: Human Intelligence\n\n\u2018How do I avail a leave?\u2019 \u2018What is the process of reimbursing travel bill?\u2019\nThese are iterative but critical queries that need immediate redressal.\nFailure to receive a correct or timely response to such questions can affect\nthe employee experience drastically. HR bots are being widely used by\norganizations to not only attend to these helpdesk queries but also to engage\nand understand the well being of the employees. For instance, Genpact uses AI\nenabled chatbots to help in their HR self-service and employee engagement.\nThey also use analytics and machine learning to interpret the communication\npatterns to predict performance and preempt attrition.\n\n## 4\\. Work Tools: Augmenting the workforce\n\nO'Reilly Media\u2019s collection of talks in mid-2015 coined the term, \u2018the\nAugmented Worker\u2019 that currently has an ever growing significance. The term\narticulates how employees are augmented and enabled using technology and its\nby-products. A typical example is when Boeing used wearable technology to\nsimplify their electrical wiring process. Instead of browsing through \u2018phone\nbook\u2019s full of diagrams and schematics, their technicians now use a voice-\nenabled search and overlay schematic that takes them through the process step\nby step. Similarly, Accenture alone has over 30 organization-wide softwares\nthat help in digital enablement, collaboration, and productivity.\n\nEven management roles have evolved at the advent of technology. Harshvendra\nSoin, the Chief People Officer of Tech Mahindra speaks of how AI is helping\ntheir managers take the right decisions and receive real-time updates. Alexa\nand their inhouse chatbot nicknamed \u2018UVO\u2019 provide analytics and information\nand responds to voice-based commands.\n\n## 5\\. Employee Engagement: Tech that drives culture\n\nLazlo Bock, ex-senior vice president of Google, co-founded Humu that solely\naims to \u2018make work better\u2019. Humu helps drive behavioral change using data and\nalgorithms by determining and nudging the top drivers of happiness,\nproductivity, and retention.\n\nThe Xoxoday platform is a stark example of how technology enables employers to\nintuitively design employee engagement and the employee to uniquely choose how\nto engage back. The platform uses social media-inspired elements of technology\nlike feeds, groups, chats, etc and e-commerce inspired extensive global\ncatalog that makes rewards truly aspirational.\n\nTech Mahindra reportedly uses facial recognition technology that not only\neliminates swipes but also helps to capture and measure their delight quotient\nand send engagement index to leaders and managers.\n\nThese innovations signify the importance companies now place on employee\nengagement. These softwares facilitate employees and companies alike to have a\ntransparent, collaborative and engaging work environment.\n\nA Deloitte study predicts what is in store for HR in 2019 and each of its\nfunctions was envisioned to have technology as an important ingredient. The\nstudy speaks of how HR will use technology to reconfigure how talent works, do\norganizational network analysis to get macro workforce insights, to look\nbeyond hiring to nurture talent and motivate employees. Technology has become\nubiquitous in HR and at all the employee touch points.\n\nThe greatest takeaway of these more efficient processes, more responsive\nenvironments, and more sensitive interactions is that these make employee\nexperience a more wholesome and purposeful journey. This, in turn, should aim\nto create better workplaces, better communities and truly better livelihoods.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-employee-\nexperience%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=5+Ways+Technology+is+Transforming+the+Employee+Experience\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5+Ways+Technology+is+Transforming+the+Employee+Experience&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-employee-\nexperience%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-employee-\nexperience%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-employee-\nexperience%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=5 Ways Technology is Transforming the\nEmployee\nExperience&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-employee-\nexperience%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\nBy Abhishek Kumar, xoxoday Co-founder\n\nEmployees are indeed the back bone of any organization. The growth and success\nof any organization are decisively influenced by the commitment and loyalty of\nemployees towards their work. Organizations are not leaving any stone unturned\nto ensure a work environment that will encourage employees to offer more of\ntheir capability and potential. Thanks to millennials who have redefined the\nrole of employees from a mere task doer to a brand advocate of the\norganization for clients, users, and customers.\n\nCompanies were only concerned about hiring the best talents on board for a\nproductive business some time back. Over a period, things gradually changed\nwhen millennials became the dominant workforce who, unlike their previous\ngeneration, won\u2019t get satisfied with a mere comfortable workplace. Excitement\nat work and scope for creativity became a crucial factor for companies to get\nbest talents onboard.\n\nWorkplaces started becoming more jovial with open office culture, vibrant\noffice space, office parties, best packages, special perks, flexible work\nhours, etc. Though these have managed to attract young talents, HR had to find\nnewer solutions to retain them as the young talent group are job hoppers who\nget attracted to many of the perks they see.\n\nEmployee engagement and reward and recognition are a few terms which started\ngarnering much attention recently. This has enhanced HR\u2019s role to something\nwhich is much more than recruitment and payroll, thanks to digitization. The\ndigitization of payroll and documentation has allowed HR to investigate other\ncomponents that will ensure utmost satisfaction at the workplace for most\nvaluable employees. These have given greater human touch to HR activities at\nworkplace.\n\n**Conduct HR surveys**\n\nHR surveys conducted frequently will help HR and managers to understand the\nsatisfaction level at the workplace, and where they must fix, streamline\nthings and then assess how well aligned the employees and employer are.\nEmployees who don\u2019t want to directly open up about the problems can also share\ntheir genuine views in an anonymous survey.\n\n**Make the employees feel that the company do care for them**\n\nOffering a competitive package may not always ensure utmost loyalty of\nemployees towards the company. The companies should stand for the wellness of\nthe employees. Providing health insurance coverage for employees and family,\nextending a small gesture of appreciation on the special occasion of employees\nlike birthdays, anniversaries, parenthood etc. will leave the employees\nemotionally connected with the organization. A flexible working hour and leave\npolicies will gift the employees a perfect work life balance. The work would\nbe more of a commitment than a liability for the employees who would be happy\nand satisfied at the work.\n\n**Opportunities to showcase their talent at work and outside work**\n\nCompetitiveness has always been projected as the best way to bring out the\nbest of talents and their capacity. The strong link between recognition and\nimproved performance has been highlighted in a lot of studies. Timely employee\nappreciation of good work is a catalyst for increased engagement,\nproductivity, motivation, performance, and retention.\n\n******Contribute to employee development**\n\nThe world of business and technology is ever evolving. Having the best talents\nwould not be enough to meet all the growing business requirements. HR can\ncontribute a lot to upskill the employees through training programmes,\ninteractive sessions, and workshop. This will not only fine-tune the employee\nto meet the company requirements but also empower them to face challenges in\nthe future. This will act as a driving force for productivity, motivation,\nperformance, and retention.\n\n******Facilitate a work environment with open communication between employees\nand management**\n\nThe HR\u2019 can conduct regular meetings with employees and senior management\nwhich would be an ideal platform for the employees to share their ideas,\nchallenges and concerns. The company can be as transparent as possible by\nopening about the achievements and business goals as this will keep employees\nmentally and emotionally committed to company goals. HR \u2018can opt for an open-\ndoor policy that motivates the employees to speak up without any hesitation\nand which will develop a sense of belonging for the employees. Small companies\nlike Xoxoday follow this very strictly, and we have employees who have been\nworking here since the day of inception as well as people who left the company\nto join back.\n\nAs told by Michael Jordan, \u201cTalent wins games, but teamwork wins\nchampionships.\u201d It\u2019s one of the key missions of HR to have the best policies\nin place to retain the talents to build a team which will win the championship\nin the most competitive world.\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

But this isn\u2019t\njust the case at big tech companies. Many small and medium-sized businesses\nalso have snacks \u2014 whether it be unlimited access to the vending machine, food\ncoupons or even Friday bagels.\n\nWhile providing food to employees is not new, there are ways employers can\nwork to keep this benefit relevant.\n\n**See also:**[New app lets employers budget money to cover worker\nmeals](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/new-app-lets-employers-budget-money-\nto-cover-worker-meals)\n\n**The psychology of free food**  \nWhen implementing a free meal program, employers must first understand the\nbasic psychology behind eating. If employees skip out on meals for one day or\neven five hours, they will feel more agitated, grumpy, frustrated and may even\nfeel sick. Having snacks in the office could help curb this, by allowing\nworkers to focus less on how hungry they are and more on the work they are\ndoing.\n\nThe word free on the other hand does something funny to our mind. Dan Ariely\nin his book \u201cPredictably Irrational\u201d says that people alter their behavioural\npatterns when they hear or see something free. Free is not just an indicator\nof price. It is a powerful emotional trigger that tricks our brain to like the\nfeeling of receiving something for nothing.\n\nBut free food isn\u2019t all positive. HR leaders should consider a few pros and\ncons before instituting the benefit in their office.\n\n**Food fosters community.** Today, the majority of employees use technology to\ncommunicate within the office. Building an environment where employees can\ninteract while eating can have a positive impact on company culture. Indeed,\nabout 35% of companies provide office meals to encourage team building,\naccording to a survey from office catering company ZeroCater.\n\n**See also:**[Free snacks won\u2019t retain workers long term. Here\u2019s what\nwill](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/free-snacks-wont-retain-workers-long-\nterm-heres-what-will)\n\n **Employees may consume too many calories.** If employers do decide to offer\nfood, they may want to consider the calorie content. If snacks are high in\ncalories or unhealthy, employees may end up unknowingly consuming too many\ncalories throughout the day. It may also cause workers to overeat.\n\n**Food encourages diversity.** The workplace is becoming more diverse and one\nway to promote that is through food. Ethnic and country-specific food can help\nmake a company more inclusive.\n\n **Food may help employers save money.** Free food may initially seem like an\nadded cost, but offering food in the office can actually help employees be\nmore productive. When workers take a one-hour lunch break or five minute snack\nor coffee break outside the office, they may end up using more time than\nintended, and therefore be less productive. When workers don\u2019t have to leave\nthe office to get a snack, they have more time to focus on work.\n\n**Opt for healthy snacks.** Sweet and calorie food might hit the spot with\nyour employees, but it also invites unhealthy habits. Replace fried snacks\nwith fruits and berries. Make meals wholesome and nutritious. Organizations\nwho opt for healthy alternatives improve morale and productivity, while\npromoting worker well-being.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de45d37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1952x1952+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Ffb%2F14%2F0769bd534f2ea9f726ee448bb80f%2Fpoonam-\nphoto.jpg)

Through the trajectory, what has also changed\nis the nature of action to be taken by HR. There has been a clear shift from\nthe reactive and prescriptive to the proactive and predictive. With the\nbusiness and talent landscape changing, HR needs to wear the protective gear\nof technology to navigate the present dynamic, digital, and disruptive\nenvironment.\n\nIs the age of disruption now, or are we at the end of a disruptive cycle,\nrecuperating and realigning ourselves before the next cycle of disruption is\nupon us? While that may be a question we ask ourselves repetitively, often\nwithout a clear answer, let\u2019s focus on what HR can do to embrace the latest\ntech trends, further the employer brand, and improve the employee experience.\n\nIrrespective of where we are in the cycle, what has been stressed upon (and\nnot without reason) is the role that HR needs to play to ensure that the\norganization can adapt, evolve, and lead. For the HR teams to be able to play\nthis crucial role, organizations need to ensure that the teams that manage\nhuman resources have all the technological resources that they need.\n\nHow are organizations and vendors preparing for and leading the latest trends?\nThe SHRM HR Tech APAC 2019 has an action-packed itinerary. Here are a few\nconversations that you should watch out for.\n\n## The Devil\u2019s in the Data\n\nWe live in a world that overwhelms us with massive volumes of data. But data\nis useless \u2013 without the right interpretive tools, that is! If an HR team is\nnot equipped to make sense of data, all of it is just piles, towers, and\nclouds of gibberish.\n\nFor example, knowing that in a Slack group of graphic designers, the unhappy\nface emoji was used 49 times over the last two days is meaningless unless you\ncorrelate it with a general mood of unhappiness in response to a new process\nthat was introduced the week before. With the right training, however, HR can\nbuild information out of data and maybe suggest a workshop to smoothen the\nshift for the employees.\n\nTechnology is the bridge that can help HR get substantial, tangible\ninformation out of all the data. With the tools and artificial intelligence\n(AI) algorithms that allow easy access to a world of information, HR can\nhumanize and consumerize the organization\u2019s culture and [employer\nbrand](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/5-ways-\nai-can-support-employer-branding-strategies/).\n\nThere are tools today like [UltiPro\nPerception](https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/UltiPro-Solution-Features-\nEmployee-Surveys) and [AlphaSense](https://www.alpha-sense.com/) that can help\nHR tap into data to understand the collective mood or conversation within an\norganization and then build a people system that is, in fact, for the people.\n\nRemember, however, that having access to vast volumes of data comes with the\npressing need to manage data security threats. The session on _Real and\nPresent Danger - Coping with Malware, Hacks and other Cyber Threats_ at the\nSHRM HR Tech APAC 2019 aims to help organizations address these concerns.\n\n**Learn more** : [How Can Big Data Transform Human Resource\nManagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-can-big-data-transform-human-resource-management/)\n\n## Decoding the Human Capital Challenges of Tomorrow\n\nTechnology leads to leaner processes. But how can we prepare for and adapt to\nthese processes better?\n\n\u201cIn a 2015 report, the Society for Human Resource Management identified\n**employee engagement, talent retention, competitive compensation and\ndeveloping the organizational leaders for tomorrow as major human capital\nchallenges,** \u201d points out Achal Khanna, CEO at SHRM India and Business Head,\nMENA & APAC.\n\nThis was three new iOS updates and Game of Thrones seasons ago. Still, we find\nthat the mentioned facets continue to remain primary challenges for\norganizations world over. However, the context around them has changed.\n\nEssentially, the work-worker-workplace universe has undergone major changes.\nWith [artificial\nintelligence](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/the-beginners-guide-to-ai-in-hr/) available to take over most\nof the high-frequency, low-value tasks, HR and employees can now find more\ntime to engage in those aspects of work that they find meaning in and can add\nvalue through.\n\nNow there are recruiting chatbots to upgrade the candidate experience, HCM\nsuites that help manage leaves, meetings, and payroll processes, personalized\nand optimized [AI-enabled rewards and recognition\nsystems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-recognition/), and\nlearner experience platforms that have changed the HR landscape forever.\n\nThe session on _The Artificial Revolution: How Organizations Need to Prepare\nfor AI_ at the SHRM HR Tech APAC Conference will address how AI can\nrevolutionize the workplace in addition to some of the challenges surrounding\nthis technology.\n\n[Employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/top-3-employee-engagement-trends-for-2019/) is a queer challenge.\nFacets around it change more dynamically than any other aspect that HR needs\nto deal with. This is probably because engagement is ruled by affect\n(emotion), and individual and collective emotion is volatile and complex \u2013\nalways moving, ever-changing. Being able to tap into the emotional connect of\nthe worker is something that the HR can now practice with the new tools at\nhand. It is now possible to personalize engagement initiatives and strategies\nin a way that appeals to each employee with tools like\n[Xoxoday\u2019s](https://www.xoxoday.com/) engagement offerings.\n\nAttend the SHRM HR Tech APAC session on _Leveraging Technology for Engaging\nLarge, Dispersed Workforces_ to understand how you can upgrade to smarter\nengagement strategies.\n\n**Learn more:** [AI in Human Capital Management (HCM): The What, Why and\nHow](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/ai-in-\nhuman-capital-management-hcm-the-what-why-and-how/)\n\n**An Eye for AI: Tech Tools for a Healthy Workforce**\n\nThe present mixed generation of employees expects a unique experience from\ntheir work, and it is HR\u2019s challenge to live up to this expectation. We live\nin a hyper-connected time in history, a time where collaboration is key across\ngeographies between individuals, disciplines, humans, and AI.\n\nAdvanced machine learning (AML) tools aid predictive analysis and improve the\norganization-talent relationship. AI-powered platforms like\n[PhenomPeople.com](https://www.phenompeople.com/) make the process of\ndiscovering, engaging and retaining top talent more humanized and\ncommunicative.\n\nFrontrunners like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have been warming up to\nwearable technology in all devices, which ensure that employees stay\nconnected. Wearable tech also provides organizations more opportunities to\nlisten clearer, motivate deeper, and engage better.\n\n**Learn more** : [How Mobile Apps Can Improve HR And Employee\nEngagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nmobile-apps-can-improve-hr-and-employee-engagement/)\n\n## In Summary\n\nWhile being ever-connected to work with anytime-anywhere access, the flip side\nbrings in the question of a healthy work-life blend (not just balance) and\nwellness. As we learn to adapt to tech leaps, we also need to learn to\ncollaborate effectively with technology in a way that enables us to add more\nvalue to our lives and to the work we do. How this equation is balanced will\nstrongly influence the [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience-and-how-to-improve-it/).\n\nTune into the SHRM HR Tech APAC session _The [EX] factor: Why Employee\nExperience should be the biggest concern in 2019_ to know more about the\nupcoming trends around improving the employee experience.\n\n**_Do you want to know what the next big thing in HR technology is?

](/article/news-ians/esic-unearths-\nfake-delivery-scam-119052700435_1.html)\n\n  * \n\nA Pandora's Box seems to have opened in the infamous maternity leave scam\nunravelling at the Employees State Insurance Corp (ESIC) regional office in\nFaridabad's Sector 16 in Haryana.\n\nAn ongoing investigation reveals that scores, not dozens, of women employees\nof private sector companies linked to the Corporation availed insurance and\nother Maternity Leave benefits, no less than four times a year, and in some\ncases even more, by declaring fake deliveries.\n\nThis was done by submitting forged medical reports in connivance with\ncontractors and departmental officers at the ESIC.\n\nMaternity Leave is paid holiday of 26 weeks.\n\nThe preliminary probe in the scam was launched after an internal audit of the\nESIC revealed a dozen such cases in a year. The case, unearthed by IANS last\nweek, is being probed by the Vigilance Department at the ESIC Headquarters in\nDelhi.\n\nFollowing the new revelation, the scope of the inquiry has been expanded from\nthree years to cover the past six years.\n\nTop sources in the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment said the benefits\ncould have been exploited in other regions of the country as well and to\nexpose that the scope of the probe had been widened.\n\nThe sources said so far six employees and three officials have been suspended\nand a task force had been set up to probe the scam.\n\n\\--IANS\n\nds/rtp/mr\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-\ngenerated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFirst Published: Wed, May 29 2019. 14:42 IST\n\n  * Read More On\n  * ##

A Skill gap is a major issue faced by both\nemployee and employers in today\u2019s fast-moving world. This is due to the advent\nof new technologies and adoption of digitalisation. The \"gap\" may indicate a\nneed to adjust headcount, rethinking your compensation package or changing\nrecruitment tactics establish a career development program, programs to\nencourage employee engagement or restructure the business. Working towards\nreducing skill gap can lead to professional improvement, increase chances of\npromotion for the concerned employee, increases productivity, increases\nemployee retention and boosts bottom-lines.\n\nVeena Amin, Senior Manager HR, Xoxoday said,\u201dIt is common these days to hear\npeople talking about skill gaps. A skill gap is a gap between what employers\nwant or need their employees to be able to do, and what those employees can\nactually do.One manager might say, \"I have got a fantastic team, but I don't\nhave one single person who understands innovation which important in a start-\nup.\"Another manager could say, \"I need people with React Js experience and I\ncan't find them, and it's killing my product!\" Almost every organization\nstruggles with skill gaps How do we solve this?\u201d She also added that at\nXoxoday various measures are being followed like \u201cfocusing only on highly\nspecific skills is important for certain niche positions where perfection is\ndemanded. But in most cases, the high specifics can be taught so focusing on\nquick learners will solve the purpose. Training presents a prime opportunity\nto expand the knowledge or fill the skill gap, this helps in Improving\nemployee performance & Improve employee satisfaction and morale. Ongoing\ntraining and upskilling of the workforce can encourage creativity through\nwhich new ideas can be formed as a direct result of training and development.\nInnovations in hiring help to find high-performing people quickly and\nrelatively less expensive than traditional hiring practices. Competency,\nskills, or cultural fit assessments on the front end of the screening process\ncan supplement an initial, r\u00e9sum\u00e9-based screening.\u201d\n\nGayathri Vasudevan, Co-Founder & CEO, LabourNet Services said,\u201dCapable People,\nGreat Process and Appropriate deployment of Capital result in great companies.\nEnsuring that a firm has capable people at an appropriate budget is the\nresponsibility of HR. HR is privy to both the future needs of a firm as well\nas today's requirements. For today's requirement's, identifying skills gap and\nensuring effective ways of recruiting right personnel and putting in place a\nrobust L&D; programme is critical. For future needs, HR needs to actively\nengage with educational, vocational educational and professional academic\nbodies to shape teaching curriculum and content.\u201d\n\nSmitha Galla, Head-Human Resources at TUV Rheinland India shared that \u201cMost\nmanagers are concerned about the Skill gap these days but what we fail to\nunderstand is that we cannot find a 100 percent best fit for our\nrequirements.. We need to tune ourselves to be close to reality.HR needs to\nfocus on Hiring, Developing and Retaining to be able to bridge the skill gap.\nCertain skills are inherited and biological and cannot be taught but such\nskills can be developed to deliver desired results. Creativity, for example,\ncannot be taught but if developed it leads to innovative ideas. And that is\nwhy bridging the skill gap starts with hiring the right candidate by\neliminating bias and being focused on what kind of people we need to build our\norganization.To be able to hire the right match we need to identify the\nproject or job-specific skill sets that are required to be qualified for a\nposition in the organization. It is also important that employees and\npotential candidates are made aware of such skills sets.Once an employee is\nhired it is also important that we have standardized skill assessments across\nteams. Levels of assessments could be set as per the organisation's\nrequirement. A five-level assessment is ideal in my opinion \u2013 Novice,\nBeginner, Practitioner, Trainer and Expert levels can be described for each\nskill type. The expected skill level of each position needs to be defined and\nemployees must be mapped against the defined skills. The gap between the\ncurrent skill level and expected skill is the area for development through\ntraining, mentoring, coaching or shadowing. Just training would not suffice,\nemployees must be empowered and given opportunities to implement what they\nlearn and demonstrate their capabilities. Bridging the skill gap is a combined\neffort of both the educators and employers.\u201d\n\nSuchita Dutta, Executive Director, Indian Staffing Federation added \u201cHR is\nbecoming a challenging function now comparatively as they need to consider\nfactors like technology, applications, and an endless flow of information and\ncommunication from diverse sources while attracting, developing and retaining\ntalent. The need is to identify the gaps in the employees\u2019 experience and what\nthey want from the organisation, so that HR can accordingly align them with\nthe company\u2019s goals and requirements and cultivate them in the desired\nculture. On the job training is a common way to do this.The other way is to\npartner with a renowned institute and explain them the organization\u2019s\nrequirements so that they can prepare desired skilled prospective candidates.\"\n\nSushil Baveja, Executive Director & Head- HR, DCM Shriram Ltd shared, \u201cHR will\nneed to be innovative and think beyond the conventional sources of seeking\nskill. It needs to work closely with the academic and technical institutions\nin building and delivering industry relevant courses & curriculum, work\nproactively on affirmative action to bring the excluded sections in the\nmainstream of workforce and encourage and incentivize multi-skilling which can\nalso open up more career options for employees.\u201d\n\nSashi Kumar, Managing Director, Indeed India said,\u201cThe issue of talent\nmismatch or skills gap is a major concern faced by recruiters across sectors\nand industries. At the same time, employees are growing increasingly concerned\nabout the skills they need to acquire in order to stay relevant in their field\nof work. While it is vital to the health and long-term viability of an\norganization to ensure its employees have the appropriate skills, it is also\nconducive to overall employee satisfaction to have people working at jobs that\nthey are well-suited for and enjoy doing. Recruiters and potential employers\ncan undertake a few measures to help curb talent mismatch, be it in terms of\npre-hiring initiatives or post-hiring programmes that could also include\ncurrent employees. Employers would do well to invest in strategic partnerships\nthat could help train new employees, as well as work towards creating a\nholistic learning culture within the organization, that encourages employees\nto continuously upgrade themselves, while also providing assessment and\nfeedback to ensure results.\u201d\n\nPallavi Jha, Chairperson, and Managing Director, Dale Carnegie Training India\nsaid, \"HR should provide quick, easy access to relevant learning for your\nemployees. Look for services that specialize in in-depth, up-to-date content\non a wide variety of topics pertaining to your business. A combination of\nlearning platforms and methodologies is the best way to create interest and\nlong-lasting learning. Partner with your workforce to figure out which skills\nthey think they need to develop based on business goals, and make an informed\ndecision. Managers should allow freedom for employees to figure out the best\nprocesses and means to achieve success, thereby fostering a creative\nenvironment. Learning in the workplace often means admitting that you don\u2019t\nknow something, or would like to expand your scope of knowledge performance.\nEmployees are understandably reluctant to do so. The job, therefore, lies with\nHR and leaders to create an environment that inspires personal growth and the\npursuit of knowledge. Leaders \u2013 and line managers too - can do this by sharing\ntheir own stories of professional development, establishing that learning is\nimportant and needn\u2019t involve any self-consciousness. Whether this means\ndiscussing resources found with other staff members or setting time aside to\ntalk about employees\u2019 latest entries into professional development, creating\nthe right culture has to start from the top. Senior leaders are the ones with\nthe most power to influence change in the culture of the business. There are\nseveral paths to build a learning organization, and they all come back to\nmanagement culture. If you build a culture that encourages and supports\nlearning, gives people time to reflect, develop, share expertise and learn\nfrom mistakes, you\u2019re on the right track.\"\n\nAnil Kumar Misra, CHRO, Magicbricks said, \u201cCompetency development has to be\nthe core agenda for HR. For long, technical training programs have been\nmanaged by different functions at their end while HR was responsible for soft\nskill training and leadership training. But now this model doesn\u2019t work. HR\nplays a critical role in identifying training programs, which would focus on\nbridging the competency gaps through training and development.For\ncomprehensive growth of any organisation learning and development has to fall\nunder HR kitty. My view is that overall competency development should be\ndriven by HR. When it comes to competency be it technical, the leadership of\nbehavioral, HR should be the custodian of Centre of Excellence (COE).\nStrategically, HR has to proactively identify potential talent in the market\nwho can join and also keeping them warm as well. In product and tech, we have\nrecently started Leadership Lecture Series, wherein the leading product and\ntech guys are invited to share their experiences with our employees. This not\nonly enlightens our employees but also works as a good brand building exercise\nto attract leading product and tech guys.Internally we also stress a lot on\njob rotation and job shadowing so that in case of any emergency our employees\nare capable of handling all the challenges. We are also planning to run a\nprogramme at the grad level on the online real estate sector. This would\nprepare the next generation of the workforce for their career challenges.\nCourses like these will give them an edge over other and by this, we can\nbridge the competency gaps.\u201d\n\nSumit Kumar, Vice President, NETAP , TeamLease Services, shared that,\u201d Indian\nenterprises can make an impact in bridging skill deficit. The best way to go\nabout doing is through apprenticeships. Look at China which has made most of\nits people. Over 80 percent of the workforce has gone through formal training\nas compared to 4 percent in India. China has 20 million apprentices in India\nwhich has approximately 4 lacs. Less than 1 percent of the enterprises in\nIndia appoint apprentices, which is abysmal as compared to the opportunity it\nholds to add to the skilled population of the country. The HR function can\nplay a vital role in making skilling happen through apprenticeships.\nEnterprises need to come forward to look at breeding talent in-house by\nadopting apprenticeship system which is \u201clearning by doing\u201d. School dropouts\nor students pursuing education or fresh pass outs can be transformed into the\nproductive workforce through on the job training. To make the learning\nimpactful for the apprentices, HR function should focus on the blended form of\ntraining, a combination of an on the job and off the job training. While on\nthe job focuses on the application of the knowledge; off the job (classroom)\nmakes the person conceptually strong. Technology could play an enabler in\nimparting off the job training. A digital platform can make knowledge\naccessible to the remotest of location and cover trainees scattered in a\ndifferent location. Employer establishments are the new classrooms for\nvocational education which are a house of relevant knowledge, has best in-\nhouse trainers to impart it and shop floors to practice it. In 1964, Gary\nBecker, a Nobel laureate, emphasized the importance of on-the-job training in\nHuman Capital. As per his study, firms ignore the effect of the productive\nprocess on worker productivity. Government alone cannot address skill gap\nwithout employers participation. HR should give a serious thought of creating\na layer of apprentices which could not only solve their problem of finding\ntalent but also address the national issue of employability of the youth.\u201d\n\nThis \"gap\" must be addressed to arm organization with an effective and\nefficient workforce. Organisations are working together to enhance skill and\nproductivity of their biggest asset that is employers.\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[skill gap](/tags/skill-gap-23906/) [knowledge](/tags/knowledge-7499/)\n[productivity](/tags/productivity-13290/) [human capital](/tags/human-\ncapital-20828/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

Work\nplace culture is the environment created by any companies to offer the best\nwork life and experience for employees to ensure utmost loyalty towards their\norganisation. The work culture would not be the same for every companies as it\nis determined by the values, expectation, missions etc of organisations.\n\nThe term work culture has undergone a lot of modification since millenials\nbecame a decisive influencers at work place.\n\nCompanies have started taking an extra effort tocreatebest experience for\nemployees along with customers . Organisations have  made  transparent\ncommunication, treatingeveryone with respect, recognising  hard work,\nconductingfun and wacky events, empowering  teamas core values and hence\nprograms that show appreciation for each others contributions, both large and\nsmallhave becoem a key affair in every organisation.\n\nCreating a day-to-day experience that offers employees meaning, impact,\nconnection and appreciation in their everyday work haslead to a culture of\nemployee engagement. And if culture would always be followed by performance .\n\nHere are 10 ways to foster employee pride through a positive employee\nexperience.\n\n **1\\. Communicate Core Values**\n\nEstablishing a defined, well-communicated vision grounded in core values \u2014 and\nrecognizing behavior that supports that vision \u2014 gives employees a sense of\nmeaning and purpose in their jobs. Having leadership communicate core values\nregularly and clearly builds meaning into the employee experience. Recently,we\nhosted a Leadership Summit,which was a1-day session that provided several\npeople managers with key perspectives and resources to deepen their leadership\ncapabilities, empower their teams, and reinforce Workday values and culture.\n\n **2\\. Employee recognition**\n\nYou can\u2019t overestimate the power of appreciation. Glassdoor found that 80% of\nemployees say they will stay at a job longer if they get appreciation from\ntheir boss. A [Gallup\nStudy](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/193238/employee-recognition-low-\ncost-high-impact.aspx)shows that employees who get some form of recognition at\nleast once a week are more likely to stay in a job longer. See our guide on\n[Reward and Recognition Systems that\nWork](http://info.youearnedit.com/download-reward-and-recognition-systems-\nthat-work)to get science-based tips for showing appreciation.Following we\nfollow:\n\n### 1\\. Make It Personal . Through Reward and recognition platform - Use\npositive words, and engage the employee to show that you really understand\nwhat he or she has done and how difficult the work was.\n\n### 2\\. Provide Opportunities For Each Worker To Contribute: Try to\nprovidecross functional training where trainer get point in the RnR\nplatform.(Incentivize)\n\n### 3\\. Magnify Recognition through Multiple Communication Channels- Town Hall\nmeetingscan be a venue to award all rock star performers\n\n### **4.** Offer Beyond-The-Call-Of-Duty Perks\n\nThese might include the following ideas:\n\n\u25cf More flexible hours\n\n\u25cf Paid time off\n\n\u25cf Celebration events for teams such as a party, company picnic or dinner\n\n\u25cf Paid training program for earning a certification, developing new skills or\npursuing other educational programs\n\n\u25cf Opportunity to work on a special team\n\n\u25cf Motivate With Financial Incentives-Loan facilities\n\n\u25cf Enlist Manager To Recognise Performance\n\n\u25cf Facilitate SElf Nomination & Peer To Peer Recognition\n\n\u25cf Design An Impressive Office Trophy With Gamification Strategy\n\n\u25cf Use Technology And Social Media To Publicise Accomplishments- Enterprise\nplatform\n\n\u25cf LSA : Recognize employee for service\n\n **Consistent, Timely Communication**\n\nEmployees  have high confidence onhaving open conversations with senior\nmanager and Tools like Connect over Coffee (skip level meetings)with Co\nFounders, open houses (Townhall Meeting)and HR connects provide employees with\na platform  to speak up. Every companiesbelieve in developing our people and\nhave embarked on the journey of talent segmentation to identify high\npotentials, recognize them and provide them with a development plan to grow\ntheir career with the organization. We believe that to build a culture, we\nhave to constantly reinforce, reiterate and collaboratively bring to life our\nvalues.\n\n **3\\. Real-Time Coaching from a Manager**\n\nAccording to Gallup, [managers account for 70% of the variation in employee\nengagement](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-\nvariance-employee-engagement.aspx). Real-time coaching from a manager is one\nof the most effective approaches for fostering employee engagement. Companies\nshould provideInternal training to bridge skill gap. No one wants to feel\nstagnant in their job. As companies grow, technology changes, and cultures\nevolve, most job requirements also change. Offers every employee an\nopportunity to grow, discover, and expand their personal and professional\nhorizons. Employees should  alsobeencouraged to spend 10 percent of their time\n\u2013 called unstructured time to chase dreams. This can include spending time\nworking on a new product, participating in innovation forums designed to share\nideas across the company.Also policieswhich extend moral as well as Fianancial\nsupport for employee topursues certificationcoursesthat willenhance his skill\nset would be of a great help for employees.\n\n **5\\. Team Environment**\n\nWhen you\u2019re spending 40+ hours a week at work, having a meaningful\nrelationship with your coworkers makes a big difference in your employee\nexperience. Having a supportive team environment builds each individual\u2019s\nmotivation. Organization should celebrate all festivities which will bring\nevery one under one cultural identity also add some human touch to it by\nrunning CSR (Corporate socialresponsibility )Programmes .\n\n**6\\. Culture of Trust**\n\n _\u201cBusiness is conducted through relationships and trust is the foundation of\nthose relationships.\u201d_ -\n\nOrganization should strongly believe in a culture of openness, transparency,\ncamaraderie, trust and mutual respect and these qualities then naturally\ntrickle down intocompanypolicies and processes. The companies should ensure\nthat every employee should have a similar experience and similar value\nproposition in working with Lifestyle. The programs that would be instituted\nat every step of an employee\u2019s journey, right from the time they join the\norganization, should be intended to delight the employee, engage them and\nensure that they can perform at their best\n\n10\\. **Competitive Pay and Benefits**\n\n **Even though** pay and benefits are not the key indicators of employee\nengagement, worrying about pay can distract employees. When you\u2019re looking at\nhow to engage employees, start out by offering competitive compensation,\nbenefits, and reasonable working conditions.With a strong focus on employee\u2019s\nhealth and overall well-being, companies conduct lifestyle assessment checks,\ndental/medical/eye check ups, life-skill workshops, stress management through\nyoga, meditation, pranic healing, check-up camps, physiotherapy .Medical\ninsurance for families of employeesare facilitated at no cost to the\nemployee.Parents at Organization can enjoy various benefits such as maternity\n& paternity leave,\n\n**12)Initiatives for women**\n\n\u201cBesides a well defined \u2018Anti sexual harassment\u2019 policy which ensures safety\nand equal rights for women, other initiatives like self defense workshops,\ncompanies should organise  self defence workshop for them.Women should  have\nan added benefit of extended maternity leave, part time/flexible working\nhours, work from home options and option to take a short-term break in\ncareers.\n\nEmployee engagement is about all about valuing your employees. Engaged\nemployee is productive, active and disciplined. It is about time to invest in\nengagement as an integral part of the workplace.\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

This can cause rifts between employees and divide them into\nteams which can be very destructive to an organization\u2019s growth.\n\nCorporate politics often occur due to weak leadership and employee\u2019s\ninsecurities. It emanates from a need to know what\u2019s happening. If the HR does\nnot play its part in creating frameworks where the employees\u2019 thoughts reach\nleaders, some employees can engage in politics and thereby bring issues up to\nthe leaders.\n\nThe HR of a company plays a major role in curbing corporate politics.\nCorporates with employees who are over 3-5 years of tenure are less prone to\nsuch gimmicks. Most of them feel they have built the organization and thus,\nthere exists a deep sense of ownership. This prevents undue hostility,\nconflicts or politics. In fact, it leads to greater collaboration and\nteamwork. In addition to this, multiple forums for employees to voice\nthemselves such as open houses, town halls, ask your leader emails, ethics\nhotline, open door policy, and grievance redressal forums help in this. HR\nshould be easily approachable by employees. This allows for issues to get\nresolved in real time, preventing escalations or festering of issues.\n\nIn the absence of these forums, workplace politics causes sides, creates\nconflict, negates competence and gives precedence to who-said-what, who-is-\nclose-to-who and who-networks-with-whom etc. Most employees look for growth.\nThe internal job postings sites usually list all open postings and policies\nthat are available for all to access and read. This ensures transparency and\nfairness and hence employees love to work in such organizations. Not only\nthis, the HR organizes multiple employee engagement activities and a healthy\nbudget is set aside to ensure an annual calendar of events around sports,\nfestivals, fun, and purpose is paid heed to.\n\nThe HR should focus on the financial, physical, food, mental and work-life\nbalance of the employees. Regular talks ensuring the health and development of\nemployees goes a long way in making them feel cared for, thus keeping politics\naway. The employees need to be kept engaged and focused on want they want and\nneed \u2013 their issues need to be addressed fast and they should be allowed to\ngrow and learn in a transparent and open environment.\n\nFrom before an employee joins till he/she exits, there should be a touch-point\nprogram that tracks their progress. An annual employee survey is an additional\ntouch-point. Most importantly, the HR thus plays an important part in\ndesigning and deploying frameworks that are robust and in partnership with\nbusiness in keeping the work environment politics-free and fun to be in with a\nfocus on learning and growing, collaboration and teamwork.\n\nIn the end, organizations that have embraced practices such as Great Place to\nWork exhibit or create their own benchmark

The growth and success\nof any organization are decisively influenced by the commitment and loyalty of\nemployees towards their work. Organizations are not leaving any stones\nunturned to ensure a work environment that will charge up employees to offer\nmore of their capability and potential. Thanks to Millennials who have\nredefined the role of employees from a mere task doer to a brand advocate of\nthe organization for clients, users and customers.\n\n  \n\nCompanies were only concerned about hiring the best talents on board for a\nproductive business some time back. Over a period, things gradually changed\nwhen millennials became the dominant work force who unlike their previous\ngeneration, won\u2019t get satisfied with a mere comfortable work place. Excitement\nat work and scope for creativity became a crucial factor for companies to get\nbest talents onboard.\n\nWork places started becoming more jovial with open office culture, vibrant\noffice space, office parties, best packages, special perks, flexible work\nhours etc. Though these have managed to attract Young talents, HR had to find\nnewer solutions to retain them as the immature talents group were job hoppers\nwho get attracted to every glitter they see.\n\nEmployee engagement, Reward and recognition etc. are a few terms which started\ngarnering so much attention recently. This has enhanced HR\u2019s role to something\nwhich is much more than recruitment and pay roll, thanks to digitization. The\ndigitization of pay roll, documentation, RNR etc. has allowed HR to\ninvestigate other components that will ensure utmost satisfaction at work\nplace for most valuable employees. These have given much more human touch to\nHR activities at work place.\n\n**HR Surveys**\n\nHR surveys conducted frequently will help HR\u2019s and Managers to understand the\nsatisfaction level at work place, where they must fix, streamline things and\nassess how well aligned the employees and employer are. For those employees\nwho don\u2019t want to directly open about the problems can also share their\ngenuine view in an anonymous survey which has gained popularity recently.\n\n  \n\n**Make the employees feel that the company do care for them.**\n\nOffering a competitive package may not always ensure utmost loyalty of\nemployees towards the company. The companies should stand for the wellness of\nthe employees. Providing health insurance coverage for employees and family,\nextending a small gesture of appreciation on the special occasion of employees\nlike Birthday, anniversary, parenthood etc. will leave the employees\nemotionally connected with the organization. A flexible working hour and leave\npolicies will gift the employees a perfect work life balance. The work would\nbe more of a commitment than a liability for the employees who would be happy\nand satisfied at the work.\n\n  \n\n**Opportunities to showcase their talent at work and outside work**\n\nCompetitiveness has always been projected as the best way to bring out the\nbest of talents and capacity. This can even make impossible tasks possible\nlike a tortoise winning race with rabbit. The strong link between recognition\nand improved performance has been highlighted in a lot of studies. Timely\nemployee appreciation of good work is a catalyst for increased engagement,\nproductivity, motivation, performance and retention.\n\n  \n\n**Contribute for employee development:**\n\nThe world of business and technology is ever evolving. Having the best talents\nwould not be enough alone to meet all the growing business requirement. HR\u2019s\ncan contribute a lot to upskill the employees through training programmes,\ninteractive sessions and work-shops with experts etc. This will not only fine\ntune the employee to meet the company requirements but also empower them to\nface challenges in future. This will act as a driving force for productivity,\nmotivation, performance and retention.\n\n**Facilitate a work environment with open communication between employees and\nmanagement.**\n\nThe HR\u2019 can conduct regular meetings with employees and senior management\nwhich would be an ideal platform for the employees to share their ideas,\nchallenges and concerns. The company can be as transparent as possible by\nopening about the achievement, business goals etc. as this will keep employees\nmentally and emotionally committed to company goals. HR \u2018can opt for an open-\ndoor policy that motivates the employees to speak up without any hesitation\nand this will develop a sense of belonging for the employees. Small companies\nlike Xoxoday follow this very strictly and we have employees who have been\nworking here since the day of inception and people who left the company to\njoin back.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

The workforce culture is now transforming from being\nlimited to the balance sheet, to the evolution of the gig economy.\n\n![Learning and Development: An investment or an\nexpense?](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1556893621/1556893620.jpg)\n\nIn today\u2019s flat world where working environments span 24/7, digital\ntechnologies have allowed the local business environment to be impacted by\nglobal trends. It is vital for employers to rethink and redesign their\nbusiness models and focus on refining their business and keep their workforce\nrelevant.\n\nThe emergence of new age technologies, such as the Internet of Things,\nSensors, Smart Networking, Cognitive Computing and Cyber Security have made it\nan open talent economy. The workforce culture is now transforming from being\nlimited to the balance sheet, to the evolution of the gig economy.\n\nThis wave, considered the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), is\ninfluencing the work environment significantly and has had a major impact on\nbusiness values, business models, services and work allocations. Employees are\nhence, required to upskill or re-skill to cope with the transformed work\nprocesses, the new business models and technologies.\n\nA Randstad Workmonitor survey for Q3, 2017 had found 90 percent of employees\nworldwide regularly update their skills and competencies, which were essential\nto enhancing their employability, and 91 percent of them considered it to be\ntheir responsibility.\n\n### Changing job roles and Need for Upskilling\n\nMany jobs have gone extinct as a natural process of technological and\nscientific evolution. A typist is no longer required. Some industry giants in\ntheir respective industries, like Nokia, Blackberry and Hindustan Motors went\nout of business, having failed to adapt to change or evolve.\n\nNot just the job type, but also job profiles are changing. Earlier, writers\nwere the most important element of any project, but with evolution and\nchanging the preference, video content is today more important and people are\nupskilling by learning cinematography and video editing, besides fine-tuning\ntheir writing skills.\n\nAlso, with the advent of technology, automation and AI have made inroads into\njobs roles like software testing, banking and journalism. This trend is\nevident in sports and business journalism, and reporters have to simply feed\nthe data and bots draft the article.\n\nThe data-driven world is transforming a mile a minute and it is important to\nequip oneself with relevant skills to keep pace with the industry changes.\n\nThe process of upskilling and reskilling is a continuous journey as job\nsecurity is a legacy of the past. What matters is employee value generation.\nDemands are changing rapidly and so are other dynamics. If an individual is\nunable to cope with the changing times, he/she will \u2018perish\u2019. A holistic\ncompetency development approach is required.\n\nContinuous learning and upskilling are required not only in fundamentals but\nalso in interdisciplinary themes like global awareness, economy and business,\nentrepreneurship, civic, health and environmental literacy. The four ways to\nadapt to these interdisciplinary themes are:\n\n\u25cf Creativity and Innovation,\n\n\u25cf Critical Thinking and Problem Solving,\n\n\u25cf Communication, and\n\n\u25cf Collaboration.\n\nEmployers need to focus on investing money and time into equipping employees\nwith the current skill sets. Upskilling the workforce and improving their\nemployability will be a solution to this skills revolution. The changing\ndynamics in the skilling space is leading the industry to a renewed focus on\nhuman development in companies. So, to develop the right blend of technical\nand soft skills, people will have to complement technology.\n\n### Skill enhancement programs\n\nMany companies opt for assessments to evaluate their employees\u2019 fit in a\ncertain job role. These programs will assess them on their aptitude, attitude,\nbehaviour and personality traits. Through an assessment, employers often see\nemployees being unable to handle responsibilities. This is when employers\nrealize the quantum of reskilling required for their employees.\n\nAs important as it is to train entry-level employees to meet the\norganization\u2019s needs and market trends, it is important to reskill the mid-\nlevel and top brass for them to be relevant and be able to adapt to the\nevolving dynamics. These programmes are a value-add to the employee\u2019s profile\nwhile it enhances the reputation of the organization since these programmes\nhelp the organization obtain maximum productivity from their existing\nworkforce.\n\n### A long-term investment or an expense\n\nEmployers consider these skill-enhancement programmes expensive and in most\ncases, companies avoid reskilling employees and onboard a fresh batch. But, in\nthe long-run, they are more expensive. Employers have to consider this\nholistically perspective wherein the expenditure on these programmes are a\nlong-term investment for the future when it comes to outcome and productivity.\n\nFirms today have many cost-effective means of upskilling their employees. They\nsponsor online courses for their employees or tie up with MOOCs or Massive\nOnline Open Courses. MOOCs are the new trend with many of the top universities\nin the world offering their courses on MOOC platforms like Manipal ProLearn,\nCoursera and edX. edX, for instance, offers courses of MIT, Harvard\nUniversity, University of Berkley, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and even\nIIMB as IIMBX.\n\nSome of the training models being adopted by firms today include:\n\n**Technology-based learning**\n\nThe forms of training with technology are unlimited. Among the common methods\nof learning via technology include training modules that use a technology\nsimulated environment to upskill employees. Through this method, a trainer is\nable to get the complete attention of the trainee because of his involvement.\n\n**On-The-Job Training**\n\nJumping right into the thick of work can sometimes be the most-effective\ntraining. This could include a combination of observation, explanation and\npractice. Hands on experience during working hours improves employee retention\nand can help increase the rate of upskilling.\n\n**Coaching/Mentoring**\n\nCoaching or mentoring of employees enhance the experience for employees. A\nseasoned professional who knows the ropes of the jobs imparts their experience\nand knowledge to employees.\n\n**Group Discussions & Tutorials**\n\nGroup discussions are most likely to take place in a classroom where a group\nof people discuss issues. Tutorials are a better form of training than\nlectures as it allows trainees to discuss issues concerning the new program.\nThese techniques allow for an interactive session between the employer and\nemployee. It also establishes the requirements of a job and helps employers\ntailor the learning according to the employees level of understanding since\nthe line of communication is two way.\n\n**Role Playing**\n\nRole-playing allows employees to act out issues that could occur in the\nworkplace. Key skills often touched upon are negotiation and teamwork. This\nskill enhancement technique helps employees to place themselves in the\nposition of higher authorities upskilling their level of thinking. Role-\nplaying also ensures that employees understand the job description and\nresponsibilities that every job role comes with.\n\n**Management Games**\n\nManagement games simulate real-life issues in the workplace. They attract\ntrainees, including active, practical and reflective employees. These games\nimprove team dynamics and help each employee assess their value in the team as\nwell as their potential. It helps bring out the strengths and weakness of the\nteam as a single entity.\n\n**Outdoor Training**\n\nA break from the regular classroom or computer-based training, the usual\npurpose of outdoor training is to develop teamwork skills. This kind of\ntraining is seen as refreshing to most employees as it is a chance for them to\nbreak out of their routine work and build their skills.\n\n**Films & Videos**\n\nFilms and videos can be used on their own or in conjunction with other\ntraining methods. To be truly effective, training films and videos should be\ngeared towards a specific objective.\n\n**Case Studies**\n\nCase studies provide trainees with a chance to analyze and discuss real\nworkplace issues. They are able to develop analytical and problem-solving\nskills, thus access practical illustrations of principle or theory.\n\n**Planned Reading**\n\nPlanned reading provides employees with better ideas of what the issues are,\ngiving them a chance to think of any questions beforehand.\n\nLearning is a lifelong process. It\u2019s the same case with skilling and\nupskilling too. It happens all through one\u2019s career given the pace of\ntransformations and technological developments. But, both individuals and\norganizations have an equally important role to play here. Organizations that\nenhance and upskill their employees definitely make an investment. They see\ntheir employees as part of the company and not an external entity. This\nculture imbibes strong loyalty towards a brand and the work culture.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning & Development](/category/compensation-\nperformance/training-development?utm_source=post_blog&utm_content=training-\ndevelopment \"Browse more in: Learning &amp;

The generational aspect helps streamline\nthe incoherence that is innate to recruitment. From 'job analysis' to\n'selection', generational attributes come into play in the process of\nrecruitment. The varied motivations of these generations profoundly affect how\nthey respond to recruitment and retention strategies and selection procedures.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of baby boomers_\n\nBaby boomers fare very well in mentorship, team development, advisory, and\nleadership roles. They display fewer job mobility behaviors, higher\noccurrences of compliance and fewer instances of termination than their\ncounterparts. Resultantly, head hunting a Baby boomer might prove to be very\ndifficult. The bright side to this resistance is that retaining a Baby boomer\nis easier than the newer generations.\n\nSourcing is more effective if done through personal references who could lure\nthem to move, than digital platforms, thus helping to break the barrier of\nimmobility. Perks, prestige, and position highly motivate Baby boomers and\nhighlighting these benefits can help attract them better. Though not born into\ntechnology, baby boomers have shown amazing learning curves when rightly\nintroduced to technology. Online screening tests should have detailed\ninstructions, and preferably, a provision for personalized support in case of\nclarifications would help correctly capture their KSAOs.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-X_\n\nIn stark contrast to their workaholic predecessors, Gen X barged that work-\nlife balance was a dire necessity. Though power itself is not alluring to\nthem, roles that need them to perform decision making attracts them., The\ncompany\u2019s deep interest in providing work-life balance and an enriched work\nenvironment, if highlighted in the candidate sourcing communication, can play\na crucial role in attracting the Gen X-ers. Career-oriented social networking\nsites can be a great venue to find Gen X-ers since they are known to be the\nlargest growing generation in social media. Quite familiar with the applicant\ntracking system and psychometric tests, they are comfortable with the tech-\nenabled screening mechanisms.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-Y_\n\nThe Gen Y is known to search for purpose in each of their efforts and once\nfound work aggressively towards it. The Job analysis process needs to dig a\nlayer deeper to find the right reasons to attract a Gen Y-er. The description\nof organizational purpose as a whole and how the job helps to achieve it is\nvery relevant in the candidate sourcing communication for this generation.\nGeneration Y members are also seen to experiment with roles before deciding on\nan ideal career. Providing internship opportunities and part-time projects is\nthe best way to evaluate a Gen Y candidature.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-Z_\n\nSocial and Environmental sustainability is a crucial value Gen Z-ers search\nfor in organizations since they are themselves highly aware and conscious of\nthese. They are also known as the most inclusive of the generations. Strong\nrecruitment communications denoting the sustainability and inclusivity\nstrategies followed by the company can significantly help in attracting Gen-\nZers. Counter-intuitively, this generation relishes face-to-face\nconversations, which could determine the selection strategy that needs to be\nused.

[This] trust doesn\u2019t form at an event in a day - it is built with\nslow and steady consistency and through creating mechanisms to allow those\nlittle innocuous [trust-building] interactions to happen\u201d._\n\nIn an interview with Inside Quest, Simon Sinek, an author, and motivational\nspeaker talks about what organizations need to be doing differently to gain\nthe trust of a millennial. Simon\u2019s conversation is also indicative of how\nengagement strategies need to be carefully accommodative to all workplace\ngenerations.\n\nToday\u2019s typical workplace constitute of cohorts of age groups consisting of\nBaby boomers(23%), Generation X-ers (30%), Millennials/ Generation Y-ers(35%)\nand Generation Z-ers(12%). These generations, characteristically have\ncontradicting value systems since newer generations tend to question the\n\u2018status quo\u2019 (Theory of generations - Karl Mannheim). These polarities are\nalso illustrations of the social phenomenon called the \u2018generation gap\u2019.\nArticulation of this tension and its sociology is key in creating effective\ncross-generational teams at organizations.\n\nThis multi-generational perspective has great implications in the strategic\nmanagement of human resources.\n\nWith different aspirations, needs and perceptions of the different\ngenerations, a one-size-fits-all compensation and benefits package can prove\nto be counter-effective. Understanding the employee overheads from the\ngenerational perspective helps the human resource department optimize this\ncost and utilize it to the advantage of the workforce.\n\n_Compensation & Benefits of baby boomers_\n\nPower and position are primary motivators to the Baby Boomers. They are not\ndriven by variable pays but health insurance or a sturdy retirement plan, due\nto their high affinity towards stability. Nevertheless, perks, privileges,\nrewards, and recognition are critical to retaining them, since they are known\nto take great pride in the benefits of their employment.\n\n_Compensation & Benefits of Gen-X_\n\nGen Xers are not merely motivated through monetary benefits, in fact, they are\nthe least amongst the generations to be affected by compensation packages\nalone. They also need their organizations to provide them benefits that allow\nthem to achieve work-life balance. Resultantly, they are the pioneers in\ndemanding flexible work schedules. Non-monetary benefits, namely, individual\nrecognition is very important to this generation. Leisure activities are an\nimportant benefit that needs to be factored in from this generation onwards.\n\n_Compensation & Benefits of Gen-Y_\n\nInfamously, millennials are known for their orientation towards monetary\nbenefits. Thus, while structuring the Compensation & Benefits, monetary\ncompensation should contain significant weightage. This generation is also\ndriven by variable pay, as a result of their ability to flourish in a\ncompetitive environment. Benefits that signify purposes - such as career\nacceleration, mentorship and support group memberships - can affect their\nretention. Specific, significant and sincere recognition is also important for\nthem.\n\n_Compensation & Benefits of Gen-Z_\n\nGen Zers are observed to be working extensively in dynamic job conditions -\nacross jobs and across organizations. Monetary benefits are important to this\ngroup but the fact that they might be associated with multiple organizations\nor communities at the same point of time allows them to be moderate in their\ncompensation demands. Nevertheless, they would require huge flexibility in\nworking conditions and engagement periods.\n\nThe employee generation mix of an organization is a key determinant in\ndeciding the compensation and benefits of packages. It is mandatory to note\nthat, benefits should not be customized for individual employees as per their\nage, because it will account to age-based discrimination. Tiered total reward\npackages, based on the employee grades, is the best way these\nmultigenerational studies can be implemented in order to remain compliant to\nthe equal employee opportunity statutes.\n\nSimilarly, the recruitment function of HR, too, needs to carefully consider\nthe multi-generational aspect of the workforce and the next part of this\narticle series aims to cover how generations affect recruitment and selection\nof manpower.\n\n**References:**\n\n  * _\"Inside Quest\" Simon Sinek (TV Episode 2016)_\n  * _Becton JB, Walker HJ, Jones-Farmer A., \u2018Generational

initiatives\nto be successful, as found by JobsForHer's DivHERsity Benchmarking Report.\n\n(Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/926076/JobsForHer_Logo.jpg )  \n  \nDiversity and Inclusion programs were formally introduced in only 29% of\ncompanies that entered the JobsForHer DivHERsity Awards Survey, as stated in\nthe DivHERsity Benchmarking Report 2019.\n\nThe JobsForHer DivHERsity Benchmarking Report 2019 is based on quantitative\ndata received from 300+ companies that entered the DivHERsity Awards.\n\nAccording to the data, 38% of companies have special initiatives to hire\nreturnees and 38% of companies have women-specific L&D; programs.\n\nThis shows that companies are making greater investments in initiatives that\nhelp recruit, retain, and advance women in the workplace. A highlight of the\nreport is that D&I; and returnee programs have surged from 10% before 2007 to\n78% between 2015 to 2018.\n\nHow are diversity and inclusion initiatives helping companies in India?  \n\n  \n72% of employers said it drove better business results 68% said it helped them\nin hiring and retaining top female professionals 67% said that it positioned\nthemselves as employers-of-choice for women However, the survey also revealed\nthat there are gender gaps at every level of the corporate pipeline, with the\ngreatest disparity at senior levels of leadership. The leaky talent pipeline\nwas reflected in the data provided with companies hiring over 30% women at the\nentry level and less than 10% at the senior-leadership level.\n\nHence, companies are striving to increase the number of women leaders through\nmentoring, engagement and recruitment initiatives. Nearly 59% responded that\nthey ran L&D; programs specifically for women.\n\nWhy are gender sensitization programs important?  \n  \nOnly 46% of the companies surveyed had gender sensitization programs to\nmeasure the impact of gender mainstreaming.\n\nEven though 80% of the companies mentioned gender sensitization programs were\nhelping them hire, retain and promote more women in the workplace, the numbers\nstill remain stark.\n\nWork-life balance initiatives can help more women enter the workforce and stay\nin it.\n\nAlmost half of all companies surveyed are rolling out flexible work policies\nto attract and retain female talent.\n\nAround 59% offer flexible work timings 59% offer work-from-home options, and\n55% offer sabbatical leave policy What about inclusive policies around\nmaternity/paternity leave?  \n  \nThe DivHERsity Benchmarking Report states that while 10% of companies offered\neven more than the stipulated 6 months of maternity leave, the data on\npaternity leave was alarming.\n\n80% of the companies surveyed mentioned that they either did not provide any\npaternity leave, had less than 2 weeks or did not answer the question at all.\n\nIn fact, 4% offered between 1-3 months of paternity leave and just 1% offered\nmore than 3 months of paternity leave.\n\nCommenting on the Report, Neha Bagaria, Founder & CEO, JobsForHer, said, \"We\nhope to see more companies focus on reducing or eliminating hiring biases;\nimplement gender-neutral policies that include both parents; design\ncomprehensive leadership development programs for women, and run strong\nDiversity & Inclusion programs to finally have more senior women leaders and\nboard members.\"  \n  \nAbout JobsForHer:  \n  \nJobsForHer is an online connecting portal to accelerate women's careers by\nenabling them to start, restart, and rise in their careers. Our vision is to\nenable women to achieve their full potential by connecting them with jobs,\nreskilling, mentorship, community and inspiration.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jobsforher/ LinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/jobsforher/ Twitter: https://twitter.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-\ngenerated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFirst Published: Thu, June 20 2019. 13:25 IST\n\n  * Read More On\n  * ##

Here's how.\n\n![Managing training and development of a multi-generational\nteam](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1556894071/1556894070.jpg)\n\nThere is a dire need for the organizations to be generation inclusive in their\nlearning and development because these generations vary widely in the way they\nlearn and their motivations to development. Especially since recent years,\ntraining has shifted focus to become more trainee-focused. Learning has become\nexploratory in nature and aims at mastery. The learning and development\nstrategy of an organization needs to accommodate the learning abilities of the\ndifferent generations.\n\n_Training and development of baby boomers_\n\nA baby boomer can be well suited to traditional classroom teaching. Most of\nthem do not exhibit natural affiliation towards tech-based dynamic learning.\nDespite this, Baby boomers show exceptional learning curves for technology-\nbased learning solutions. Thus, an organization-wide tech-based learning\nprogram should be complemented with proper tech training for the Baby Boomers\n- to ensure their participation in it.\n\nThe longer attention span of this generation can be an advantage to design\ntraining programs that can have lengthier sessions and content.\n\n_Training and development of Gen-X_\n\nGen-Xers highly appreciate organizational efforts on Training and Development.\nThey are flexible to adapt to any form of learning - traditional or\nelectronic, but the real focus of the organization in developing their people\nis a great driver for this group. Leadership and management training could\nprove vital in acceleration programs for Gen X since, in comparison to Baby\nBoomers, they tend to focus less on training themselves for leadership roles.\n\n_Training and development of Gen-Y_\n\nMillennials demand active learning that demonstrates real-life scenarios.\nCareer advancement and promotional opportunities are most significant for this\ngeneration and is an essential indicator of growth. Since instant\ngratification is essential for them, their development timeline needs to be\ndivided into frequent milestones.\n\nGen Yers are known to adapt to new age training and development processes\nquickly. Since millennials form the most significant chunk of the working\npopulation, it is inevitable for organizations to adapt tech-enabled dynamic\nlearning processes swiftly.\n\n_Training and development of Gen-Z_\n\nGen Z is seen to be using social media, digital meeting places, and digital\ncontent significantly for their learning. However, researchers state that\nyounger generations like Gen Z would require additional training on how best\nto communicate face-to-face. Thus, especially for roles that are customer-\nfacing, it is imperative to get them trained on selling and communication\ntechniques.\n\nThe training methodologies need to be less directive, un-supervised and\ndigital because they are well equipped with dynamic learning and enablement\nusing technology.\n\nThe generations are more alike than different.\n\nJ. Mencl and S W Lester investigated similarities and differences in the\ncharacteristics of the workplace generations in their 2014 study. They figured\nthat all generations placed equal importance on 7 out of the 10 workplace\nfactors that they were trying to evaluate - thus coining that \u2018generations are\nmore alike than different\u2019.\n\nDespite this, generations are subject to blatant stereotyping and prejudices.\nThus utmost care needs to be taken while incorporating this on to\norganizational strategies.\n\nThe best way to accommodate these generational differences and still not bring\nupon any form of stereotyping is by opening the options up for the employees\nto choose from. For instance, while designing a training and development\nprogram, offer utmost flexibility to the employees to choose from all forms of\nlearning methodologies available - be it the Baby boomer preferred \u2018classroom\u2019\nmode or the Gen Z preferred \u2018dynamic\u2019 mode.\n\nEach cohort, through their unique differences, brings unique strengths,\nperspective, skills and challenges to the table. Being inclusive of these\ndifferences allows an organization to engage and manage their workforce\nefficiently.\n\n_This is part 3 of the three-part article series which intends to address how\nmulti-generational insights can help in different HR functions to synergize a\ncross-generational workforce._\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Training &

(MHRIL), a leading travel company\nfounded in India in 1996 has been a leader in the timeshare business outside\nof the US. The company has recently undergone a lot of updates in terms of\nsustainability, new destinations to make their products even more experiential\nfor the modern-day traveller, further expansion plans, etc., details of which\nKavinder Singh, CEO & MD, Mahindra Holidays and Resorts decoded in an\ninterview with BW Hotelier. Excerpts:\n\n **Please brief us about how the decades have been for MHRIL, and the various\nproducts offered by MHRIL including Club Mahindra Holidays, Club Mahindra\nFundays, Club Mahindra Bliss, etc., and how these are directed to a different\nset of travellers i.e. family, corporates, leisure, etc.**\n\nIn September 1996, the Mahindra Group decided to enter the hospitality and\nresorts business. It was a well-thought decision by the Group to invest in the\nsector since \u2018timeshare\u2019 as a concept was relevant for our country to enjoy\nhigh-quality affordable holidays for Indian families. One key insight for us\nwas that timeshare concept allows families to spend quality time with each\nother and this resonated well with the Indian ethos of family bonding and\nspending time together. At that time there were players who were not able to\nbring the element of trust, Mahindra brought much-needed trust and the rest is\nhistory.\n\nFrom a single resort destination in Munnar in 1996, we have now grown to\naround 2,45,000 members. Our partnership with Resorts Condominiums\nInternational (RCI), allows Club Mahindra guests to pick and choose a vacation\nfrom a bouquet of 4,500-plus affiliated resorts worldwide. The acquisition of\nHoliday Club in 2015, which owned resorts across Finland, Sweden and Spain,\nfurther opened doors for our guests in 33 resorts in Europe and made us the\nlargest player outside the US. All of this has made us India\u2019s leading\nvacation ownership company in just over two decades of entering the business.\n\nOur company's flagship offering, Club Mahindra Holidays (CMH), focuses\nentirely on families and lives by the credo: 'Good living, happy families\u2019 for\nour members and guests. I feel proud of the fact that our company has been\nable to create a culture of regular family vacationing amongst our members for\nthe last 21 years.\n\nThe core proposition of CMH is to offer our member families a holiday for\n7N/8D every year for 25 years and create memorable experiences, regardless of\nthe destination. We offer a range of varied experiences at the resort, from\ncultural activities to gourmet sessions, adventure activities to art workshops\n\u2013 delighting everyone at the same time!\n\nClub Mahindra Bliss, our second offering, is a point-based product designed to\noffer flexibility for people above the age of 50 years. It offers points based\nflexible holidaying options for tenure of 10 years. We launched this product\nin 2017 and have received an encouraging response. It fits in well with the\ngrowing segment of these travellers who are both time rich and money rich.\n\nClub Mahindra Fundays is our points-based offering for corporates. This\nproduct works as an employee engagement program for organisations and is used\nby employees to holiday along with their family. It\u2019s a great way of\npropagating work-life balance by the HR teams in these organisations. Some\nbusinesses also use it as a distribution engagement program by offering it to\nthe sales channel team members.\n\n **Being the largest vacation ownership company outside of the US, what\nmeasures and developments are you considering maintaining the position?**\n\nOur endeavour is to benchmark ourselves against larger US-based players and\nbecome better. Mahindra Holidays has therefore been following a three-pronged\nstrategy to consolidate its position as the largest vacation ownership company\noutside the US. First, we are rapidly working to create new resorts and expand\nour resort network and provide unparalleled experiences in and around those\nresorts.\n\nThe second aspect of the strategy is to create a seamless consumer experience\njourney by creating intuitive touchpoints through the lifetime of members.\nThese touchpoints are proactive and digitised to a large extent.\n\nThe third tenet is to deepen the experience ecosystem and thus create a\ndifferentiator against other direct or indirect competitors within the\nholidaying space.\n\n **Please brief us about the acquisitions and affiliations carried by MHRIL\nover the years.**\n\nOur long-standing association with RCI, a holiday exchange network with over 2\nmn members across the world, gave us a global footprint, allowing our patrons\nto choose from over 4,400 resorts. Club Mahindra offers a complimentary RCI\nmembership, which is valid for a limited period.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the acquisition of Holiday Club Resorts in 2015 was one\nof our major milestones. The main objective of this acquisition was to use\nthis as a platform and evaluate expansion options in Western Europe. Today, we\nown 95.16% of the Finland-based company that has resorts across Finland (25\nresorts), Sweden (2) and Spain (6).\n\nIn 2016, we invested in Xoxoday Enterprise, a technology platform company\nengaged in providing an employee engagement platform. The mainstay of their\noffering is curating experiences and offering them to employees. The primary\nreason for this investment was to participate in the ever growing space of\nexperience consumption and to curate such experiences and offer them to our\nmembers. We have been successfully providing 2600 experiences in 30 cities for\nthe last one year. All this is being offered to our members through our\nwebsite and mobile app.\n\n **What are MHRIL\u2019s efforts towards sustainability? How do your resorts cater\nto the responsible modern-day traveller?**\n\nSustainability comes in various forms and sizes at Mahindra Holidays. It also\nincludes generating employment opportunities and alleviating poverty. Let me\nshare a few examples.\n\nClose to our property at Coorg in Karnataka, there is a tribal village called\nSurlabi. Here, the people subsist on the sale of local honey, spices and\nvegetables grown on their land. When our Coorg team realised that the honey\nproduced \u2013 locally called Kala \u2013 was of a unique variety and was to be found\nonly in this village, we began supporting the villagers. Last year, around 60\nvillagers were provided with pots to initiate apiculture. The objective of\ndoing this was to help the villagers to increase the production of honey and\nthereby, improve their income. And, of course, Club Mahindra also helps the\nvillagers to find buyers for this unique produce.\n\nThen, there\u2019s another project in Kumarakom, Kerala. Last year, our local team\nfacilitated a training session for the local, rural women in the vicinity of\nthe resort. This was to encourage organic farming of mushrooms and other\nvegetables and reduce usage of chemicals and poisonous pest control measures.\nWe promoted the sales of their produce to neighbouring resorts and other\nmarkets, ensuring income generation for the female members.\n\nWe are India\u2019s first hospitality company to join the global campaign RE100 and\nEP100. By signing on to both, we have reinforced our commitment to achieving\nour renewable energy and energy productivity targets. We believe these\ninitiatives are in alignment with our mission of \u2018Good Living, Happy\nFamilies\u2019.\n\nWe have recently begun powering Club Mahindra resorts with solar energy. In\nits first phase, the project is being implemented across eight resorts in five\nstates. Over the next 25 years, we predict savings of more than INR 77 crores\nin power costs across all eight resorts. We will continue to adopt sustainable\npractices to further reduce our carbon footprint. The company was bestowed\nwith the prestigious Golden Peacock Award for Sustainability in 2017.\n\n **Which are the key locations where MHRIL set up their resorts in India and\nabroad? Why?**\n\nOur endeavour has always been to create the best experience by creating exotic\nresorts for our members. Over the years, we have expanded our network to cover\nsome popular tourist destinations in India such as Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala.\nAt the same time within these popular destinations, we have created new\ndestinations such as Munnar, Kumbhalgarh, Binsar, Naldehra and Ashtamudi. As\nfar as our resorts outside India are concerned, we are focused on catering to\nthe outbound Indian travellers, especially connected to destinations serviced\nby low-cost carriers (LCCs). I mean destinations such as Dubai, Bangkok,\nSingapore, Kuala Lumpur. We have also gone ahead with inventory arrangements\nin Orlando, a popular family tourist destination in the United States. Our\nendeavour will continue to be to create resorts at destinations preferred by\nIndian families.\n\n **What are your expansion plans to add more resorts to the existing\nportfolio? What business model/s are you considering to further spread your\nfootprint in India and overseas (please specify countries)?**\n\nWe are looking at greenfield, brownfield and lease options to expand our\npresence. In greenfield, we have one project at Assonora in Goa. In\nbrownfield, we have an expansion project in Ashtamudi and a few others in the\npipeline. We have also done lease arrangements for three properties in the\nNorth East region. Our recent inventory arrangements include three properties\nin Bhutan.\n\n **What opportunities or challenges in MHRIL facing to cater their patrons\nwith experiential products?**\n\nWe are witnessing a huge opportunity since both the number of people\nholidaying, and frequency of holidays is increasing. All this is reflecting in\nenhanced growth within the domestic tourism segment. Additionally, Indian\nfamilies are also increasingly holidaying abroad. This shift in consumer\nbehaviour is a boon for us and reflects in our new resorts being created.\nIndian outbound travellers are estimated to be 50 mn by 2020 up from 15 mn in\n2016. (Fact base)\n\nTo cater to this trend, we are also introducing an array of products to cater\nto different market segments.\n\nThe other trend we are witnessing is the increase in spends of Indian\nholidaymakers on experiences and therefore our effort is to offer members\nresort experiences that are unmatched. In addition, we have created a bouquet\nof experience offerings for our members not restricted to resorts. For\nexample, we provide access at special price to the Rann festival, Kumbh Mela,\ncruises, scuba diving, in-city experiences such as dining on a helipad, micro-\nlite flying and many more.\n\nWe also recently introduced a one-of-a-kind program for members \u2013 Club M\nSelect which includes exclusive deals across 4,00,000 hotels worldwide, 12,000\nplus cruises globally, 60,000 plus excursions in 180 plus cities\ninternationally and dining across 300 fine dining restaurants in top ten\nIndian cities.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this

Read\nhere to know about their journey and how they are helping companies solve\nengagement challenge through personalized e-gifting.\n\n![How giftech startup Storecheq is enhancing corporate gifting\nexperience](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1528280323/1528280186.jpg)\n\nIn August 2016, around the festival of Rakhi, a gifting platform, Storecheq\nwas launched. Its founder Vivek Gupta along with his team incepted the product\nbetween August 2015 and December 2015, with intent to enhance the corporate\ngifting experience for individuals. The aim was to give more choice and\nfreedom to the ultimate user of the gift. Vivek and his team realized that\norganizations and employees usually struggle in choosing rewards for their\nvarious employees and often the employees don't even like the gift.\n\n> Vivek says, \"Most of the times in business gifting, the appreciation of the\n> gifts is very low. An unwanted gift becomes a liability. Therefore the aim\n> was to create a platform where the businesses can come and create their own\n> engagement programs using their own gift cards.\"\n\n### Personalized gifting experience: How does it work?\n\nThrough a platform, Storecheq.com, companies can create their own branded gift\ncards. The platform allows them to configure these cards for denomination and\nvalidity and then these cards can be customized to carry the customers brand\nand communication. Interestingly, these gift cards and communication can be\ncreated by the users themselves on the platform. Later, these gifts can be\nsent across to the receiver electronically or physically. Further, Strorecheq\nalso tries to ease the process of sending gifts by allowing its customers to\nsend gift cards to 100s of receivers in one go, in less than five minutes.\n\nOn the other side , the person who receives this gift card creates an account\non Storecheq and adds the value of the gift card in his or her account. The\nreceiver can then use this amount across more than 100 brands including\nAmazon, Flipkart, Big Bazaar, Shopper Stop, Lifestyle, M&S, Dominos, KFC,\nBookmyshow, among others.\n\nVivek q says, \"Based on the choice and convenience of the receiver, the amount\ncan be used at any of the brands available on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart\nand Big Bazaar. The receiver has the freedom to choose how he/she wishes to\nspend the entire amount across multiple brands at different times based on the\nneed.\"\n\nTherefore, Storecheq is a unified platform to buy, sell, create and redeem\ngift cards.\n\n### From 20 to 80 clients\n\nStorecheq's first milestone in the journey of becoming one of the largest\ncorporate gifting firms in India was finding a suitable partner who could\nunderstand its requirement and develop the product accordingly. Vivek shares,\n\"Most of the companies we approached were typical in their approach and did\nnot show any inclination towards understanding the requirement. This is how\nmost of the outsourcing companies work. However we zeroed down on a partner,\nwho showed some enthusiasm and understanding, but after spending over six\nmonths with them, we could not get the product we wanted.\"\n\nAfter struggling to find a suitable vendor, Vivek and team decided to build\nthe product in-house. And that's when they hired their first technical person,\nTarun, who Vivek describes as a gem of a guy.\n\nHe says, \"Tarun came with the right mindset and energy. It took us one month\nof hard labor to get our first sneak of the product but ever since then we\nnever looked back. We built a team and faced the challenges together. Here's\nwhere our experience of 20 years in corporate also came to the rescue.\"\n\nStorecheq took its first leap in October 2016 when it got its first customer\non board. Later it went on to add many feathers to its cap, starting from\nbeing recognized by DIPP, the government of India, in Start-up India program\nto being shortlisted for People Matters TechHR Startup Program. From then on\nthe team of Storecheq has expanded and so has its customer base. From a\ncustomer base of 20 companies in 2017, it has now moved ahead to serving about\n80 companies, who are using Storecheq's platform for various purposes like\nemployee rewards and recognition, customer engagement, promotion, referral\nbonuses and festive gifting, etc.\n\n### The future ahead\n\nAs Storecheq looks forward to scaling its enterprise segment in India further,\nit also wishes to take the platform global.\n\n> Vivek adds, \"We have completed our proof of concept with a test market and\n> are now looking to grow further and consolidate our brand with our\n> customers. We are now looking to grow in the enterprise segment pan India.\n> The next step would be to take the platform global.\"\n\nThe gifting industry in the country is expected to touch _**$84 Bn by 2024\nfrom $65 Mn**_ , at present, as per a report provided by Qwikcilver. And\ncorporate gifting accounts for more than 80 percent of this market share. The\nproliferation of smartphones has led the millennials in the country to embrace\ndigital gifting on a large scale and almost 66 percent prefer sending or\nreceiving e-gift cards as compared to physical cards.\n\nIn India, digital gifting contribution will scale 3-fold to be 8 percent share\nof the gifting market, with a market size of about $6 Bn. Leveraging the vast\npotential of this industry, a lot of startups are emerging in this sector and\nproviding a variety of innovative gifting solutions and services. Thus there\nis a big opportunity for Storecheq to grow further and expand. However, it\ncompetes with several other gifting tech startups like xoxoday, Giveter and\nGiftology. How Storecheq will hold its fort amidst the growing competition and\nmake most of the rapidly growing gifting industry is something to watch out\nfor.  \n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Technology](/category/technology-\noutsourcing/technology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=technology \"Browse\nmore in: Technology\"), [Rewards & Recognition Technology](/category/benefits-\nand-rewards/rewards-recognition-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=rewards-recognition-technology\n\"Browse more in: Rewards &amp; Recognition Technology\"),\n[#TechHRStartup](/tag/techhr-\nstartup?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=techhr-startup \"Browse more in:\nTechHRStartup\"),\n[#TechHR2018](/tag/techhr-2018?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=techhr-2018\n\"Browse more in: TechHR2018\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

Building: Love in the Time of Likes\n\n05/25/2017 [ Manoj Agarwal ](http://www.iamwire.com/author/manoj-agarwal)\n\n![brand building](http://www.iamwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brand-\nbuilding.jpg)\n\nIn this age of digital abundance, companies are finding it increasingly\ndifficult to differentiate and stand out from the crowd. The connections in\nthe digital world are so easy that a product or service is exchanged between\nvarious hands at the same time. There are frequent new entrants and copy-cat\nbusinesses due to extremely low entry barriers. More often than not, neither\nthe businesses have a clear product positioning nor the consumer really\nunderstands what this product or company stands for. In this process,\ncompanies tend to become everything for everyone or nothing for anyone.\n\n#### An app of apps, a platform of platforms\n\nThe plug and play nature of digital products is disintegrating established\nvalue chains. The go to market time in the digital world is also small which\nfurther makes it difficult to remain 'unique' for a long time. Digital\nbusinesses interact strongly with each other through APIs and thus, the\nconsumers are consuming a mesh of such APIs. There is an app of apps, a\nplatform of platforms and a 'horizontal' of many 'verticals'. The network\neffect of consumers, suppliers and talent in the digital age creates almost\nperfect monopolies, thus making it very difficult for smaller players to\nsurvive. In such a scenario, building a brand as your key differentiator is\nmuch more critical than ever before.\n\n#### Ease of entry = low brand recall?\n\nDigital age provides almost perfect transparency in prices, services, product\ndetails and more. It\u2019s easy for a consumer to switch among products or\nservices with few clicks and swipes. The result is faster commoditization of\nmost products and services, leading to a price war and a huge pressure on ROI.\nMost of the business sectors have lost the advantage of arbitrage they once\nhad from information asymmetry. Consumers will always love continued low costs\nbut that would not serve the purpose of any business in the long term. The\nability to offer uniqueness in product for most of the companies is very short\nlived as it takes very little time to replicate a product or service. Also,\nearning loyalty from the consumers of today who have access to an array of\nchoices from across the globe is getting tougher by the hour. Thus, it\u2019s a\nvicious circle where easy entry or production is leading to low consumer\nloyalty or brand recall.\n\n#### Love > likes\n\nIn the digital world of low cost sameness, I feel that businesses need to find\nan emotional connect as their best differentiator. Due to the very virtual\nnature of digital businesses, the best way to connect with a consumer is to\nbring emotions into the mix. When digital sameness drives out your margins,\neliminates your differentiation, and commoditizes your offering, the need for\ncreating a brand through strong emotional connections becomes very important\nbecause in the digital connected economy, people talk about what they love and\nnot what they like.\n\n#### Brand, not growth hacking, will earn you consumer love\n\nHowever, many young businesses today, in a quest to grow too fast, don't give\ndue attention to brand building. While growth hacking and technical methods of\ngrowth are required, one should not forget the importance of brand building.\nGrowth hacking techniques should be used from a lens of brand building. Short-\nterm and trivial metrics via growth hacks should not affect the long-term goal\nof a brand. Marketers and businesses should note that growth hacks and digital\nmarketing are just ways of growth and marketing, and should be integrated with\nthe overall brand building exercise. While growth hacking and growth marketing\ntechniques will get you the likes, it\u2019s the brand which will earn you the\nlove.\n\nOne should understand that brands can't be build overnight. It\u2019s a philosophy\nand one need to live it every day in different aspects of product, design,\nmarketing, customer delight, packaging, advertising, pricing and much more.\nMoving brand from being an external factor to an internal one requires a\nchange in mindset. A holistic and conscious approach in offline and online\nmedia (paid, owned and earned) at every touch point with business stakeholders\nlike consumers, suppliers, employees and investors can build a good long-term\nbrand.\n\n#### A brand is a story that is always being told\u2026\n\nTo sum it up, we are all social animals who love listening to stories since\nchildhood. So, simple storytelling is the easiest way of communicating,\nexpressing emotions, and perceiving the world around us. Businesses also need\nto integrate storytelling as one of the key brand building exercises. Stories\nhave always been part of any brand building exercise, just that the media\nformat of these stories has kept evolving with time. Earlier it was more of\nTV, print and/or radio; now digital has become a key additional channel. As\nScott Bedbury once said, \u201ca brand is a story that is always being told\u201d.\n\nThe romance of building brands is amazing. It is as relevant in the digital\nera as it was before. As someone rightly said, products are made in factories,\nbut brands are created in the minds of the consumers. It\u2019s easy to replace\nproducts but not so easy to replace a brand. So, if you need love in this age\nof likes, focus on building the brand as building brand relationships is the\nultimate love story for any business.\n\n* * *\n\nHave content to share?
