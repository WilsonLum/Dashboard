With a myriad of\ndifferent AI uses today, what separates the good from the great? On 17th March\n2020, International Data Corporation (IDC) published a new Innovators report\ntitled \"IDC Innovators: Artificial Intelligence--Powered Automation Solution\nProviders in Asia/Pacific (Excluding Japan)\", profiling four companies that\nprovide artificial intelligence (AI)-powered automation solutions. Of these\nfour companies, X0PA has been recognized for its use of ethical AI to automate\nthe hiring process to achieve a highest level of objectivity.\n\nWhat is X0PA AI? Well, it is the second the venture of Founder and CEO, Nina\nAlag Suri. She previously started a global executive search firm, Nastrac\nGroup back in 1997 eventually operating for almost two decades and across 5\ncontinents. With 20 years of experience, Nina identified the large\nsubjectivity in traditional recruitment processes. She decided to change\nthings and AI was the way to go. Thus, X0PA Ai was born. X0PA AI solutions pan\nacross Universities and Colleges, Government sector as well as organizations\nfrom Startups and SMEs to large enterprise, for bringing selections to scale\nfor employees, interns and graduates.\n\nAI-powered automation solutions or intelligent automation is much more than an\nintelligent robotic process automation (RPA). It is a way to support, augment,\nand sometimes automate many aspects of a knowledge worker's tasks to improve\noperational efficiency, increase robustness and flexibility, create space for\nthe workforce to release their creative intelligence, and kick-start the man-\nmachine collaborative learning cycle.\n\n\"We are delighted to be recognised by IDC as one of the innovators and are\nexcited to continue to innovate to help improve the selection of people be it\nhiring or other use cases\" Said Nina Alag Suri. \"Objective selections to scale\nis what we stand for\".\n\nX0PA does this through its machine learning, natural language processing, and\nvideo analytics to predict the best fit between hiring companies and\nindividual talents. It also seamlessly integrates with existing platforms in\nan end-to-end hiring and talent management process. Evidently, X0PA has been\nsuccessful in reducing the need for human oversight in many hiring processes\nthat were once thought to be perpetually manual and subjective.\n\n  \n\n#### About IDC\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market\nintelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology,\ntelecommunications, and consumer technology markets.

The new entity aims to provide faster and better hiring decisions for\nclients and a completely transparent platform to candidates, according to\nmedia release on Tuesday. This is done by using Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nto match candidates to jobs and by automating parts of the hiring process.\n\nSingapore-based Xopa AI will be acquiring 100 percent of Nastrac. All current\nclients from Nastrac will be taken over into Xopa Managed Services, where all\nof the current services provided will continue. Along with the acquisition, in\nearly the early stages of this year (2019) Xopa Ai will open a new office in\nHelsinki, Finland.\n\nThis office is designed to penetrate the European market, opening the client\nbase up to another region. The current CEO of Nastrac Group **Farida\nCharania** will take over the new role of Head of Europe with immediate effect\nand will be based out of Helsinki which is identified as the European\nheadquarter of Xopa.\n\n### Latest News\n\n  * [ ![Fund Buyers Anticipated Increased Volatility](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![Fund Buyers

That\u2019s according to CV-Library, the UK\u2019s leading independent job board.\n\nThe findings, which compare job market data from September 2019 with the same\nperiod in 2018, also reveal that certain UK cities saw even bigger hikes in\nsalaries, including Brighton (up 73.8%), Newcastle (up 57.2%) and Bristol (up\n31.5%). Alongside this, Glasgow saw the biggest jump in jobs (up 32.9%),\nfollowed by Edinburgh (28.1%) and Nottingham (26.3%).\n\n####  **Lee Biggins, founder and CEO of**[ **CV-Library**](https://www.cv-\nlibrary.co.uk/cvdatabase) **, comments:**\n\n> \u201cThis underlying job market growth is certainly surprising given the\n> uncertainty amid Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful decision to suspend parliament.\n> However, despite the Brexit mess we find ourselves in, we know that\n> September is usually a busy month for hiring, which could explain why\n> employers are feeling confident and why the market has experienced such a\n> boom.\n>\n> \u201cCompanies in the UK are showing their mettle in abnormal hiring conditions\n> and are continuing to defy expectations by pushing forward with their\n> recruitment efforts. That said, organisations should be cautious of\n> constantly pushing up pay as it might not be sustainable in the long run.\u201d\n\nAccording to the findings, it appears that professionals are responding\npositively to the job market boom, as applications rose by a sturdy 18.9%.\nWhat\u2019s more, it appears that the South saw the biggest jump in candidate\nappetite, with Brighton (up 36.2%), Southampton (up 31.9%) and Portsmouth (up\n31.5%) experiencing the biggest increases.\n\n####  **Biggins continues:**\n\n> \u201cWhile the job market is strong and it\u2019s a popular time to search for a job,\n> employers shouldn\u2019t relax and rest on their laurels. The Brexit deadline is\n> looming and there\u2019s certainly a bigger issue at hand. We all know that the\n> job market may be affected by a no-deal exit on the 31st and while this is a\n> real possibility, my advice would be to take advantage of this jobs boom\n> now, as we don\u2019t know how long it may last for.\u201d\n\nRelated company:\n\n![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/cv-library_5.png)\n\nPremium[CV-Library.co.uk](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)[View\nprofile](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Related News\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_26.jpg?itok=rTPIU1S0)](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-application-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n    * 03 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Partnerships](/category/events/news)\n\n### [CV-Library announces new job posting and application integration with\nX0PA Ai ](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-\napplication-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/cvl_blue_logo_2.jpg?itok=WPyH9nD6)](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-clients)\n\n    * 02 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Launch](/category/events/news-0)\n\n### [CV-Library introduces new video interviewing functionality for clients\n](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-\nclients)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_25.jpg?itok=yFT5DOYn)](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-experts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n    * 31 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [Statistics](/category/events/news-2)\n\n### [Brits scramble for immediate work, as experts warn unemployment rate\ncould double in Q3 ](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-\nexperts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_24.jpg?itok=POC0Y_V9)](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-driving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n    * 24 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [Job searches surge in driving, retail and healthcare industries, as UK\nworkers react to employer demand](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-\ndriving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

At\n> the same time, while there are more jobs on offer than a year ago, we know\n> that there is a storm on the horizon in the form of Brexit, which is leaving\n> many organisations facing a huge sense of economic uncertainty.\u201d_\n\nInterestingly, the data also shows that applications are up by 10.2% year-on-\nyear, suggesting that many UK job hunters are making the most of booming pay.\nIndeed, applications increased the most in the South East (15.2%), the East of\nEngland (12.5%) and the South West (10.9%).\n\n####  **Biggins continues:**\n\n> _\u201cWhile applications are up right now, we know that the national employment\n> rate is at an all-time high and many employers are still struggling to fill\n> their roles. There is still an evident skills shortage in the UK, which has\n> clearly resulted in a huge jump in pay. For now, we\u2019ll need to sit patiently\n> and wait to see what happens with parliament in the coming weeks.\u201d_\n\nRelated company:\n\n![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/cv-library_5.png)\n\nPremium[CV-Library.co.uk](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)[View\nprofile](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Related News\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_26.jpg?itok=rTPIU1S0)](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-application-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n    * 03 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Partnerships](/category/events/news)\n\n### [CV-Library announces new job posting and application integration with\nX0PA Ai ](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-\napplication-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/cvl_blue_logo_2.jpg?itok=WPyH9nD6)](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-clients)\n\n    * 02 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Launch](/category/events/news-0)\n\n### [CV-Library introduces new video interviewing functionality for clients\n](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-\nclients)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_25.jpg?itok=yFT5DOYn)](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-experts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n    * 31 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [Statistics](/category/events/news-2)\n\n### [Brits scramble for immediate work, as experts warn unemployment rate\ncould double in Q3 ](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-\nexperts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_24.jpg?itok=POC0Y_V9)](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-driving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n    * 24 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [Job searches surge in driving, retail and healthcare industries, as UK\nworkers react to employer demand](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-\ndriving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

Despite\nthis, over one in four (28.4%) believe that their career success is defined by\nhow others see their achievements. That\u2019s according to the latest research\nfrom _[CV-Library](https://www.cv-library.co.uk)_ , the UK\u2019s leading\nindependent job board.\n\nThe survey asked professionals how they felt about their career and whether\nthey thought they were on the road to success. While 79% said that career\nsuccess is important to them, the majority (64.1%) of UK workers felt that\nthey hadn\u2019t achieved career success yet.\n\nWorkers were asked to share how they measure career success, the top five\nresponses include:\n\n  * Enjoying what you do \u2013 83.6%\n  * Being proud of what you\u2019ve achieved \u2013 73.8%\n  * Doing a job that makes a real difference to people\u2019s lives \u2013 57.1%\n  * Working for a company you love \u2013 54.2%\n  * Earning a high salary \u2013 42.4%\n\n####  **Lee Biggins, founder and managing director of _[CV-\nLibrary](https://www.cv-library.co.uk)_ comments on the findings: **\n\n\u201c _It\u2019s positive to see that workers rate job satisfaction as the top measure\nof career success. This suggests that they\u2019re putting their happiness first.\nIt\u2019s also evident that the company they work for plays a big role in how they\nview their success. As an employer, this proves that you need to prioritise\nemployee engagement in your workplace._\n\n_\u201cThat said, it\u2019s concerning to learn that one in four professionals define\ntheir career success by how others view them, not themselves. Employers need\nto promote a culture where all achievements are celebrated, helping workers\nfeel proud of their individual successes.\u201d_\n\nProfessionals were also asked at what age they believe you should have\nachieved career success. A quarter (23.6%) believe that you should have\nachieved career success by the age of 40.\n\nHowever, 46.2% of under 18s and 37% of 18-24 year olds said that you should\nhave achieved career success by the time you\u2019re 25. That\u2019s compared to just\n2.6% and 5.6% of those aged under 24 choosing the age of 40, respectively.\n\n####  **Biggins continues:**\n\n_\u201cWhen starting out in their careers, it\u2019s evident that younger professionals\nare keen to find success early on. As their biggest measure of success is\nenjoying what they do, this is more achievable than hoping to have a through\nthe roof salary at such as young age._\n\n_\u201cIt\u2019s great to see that the next generation are ambitious and have high hopes\nfor their careers. Employers need to ensure that the opportunities are there\nfor workers to have career development; offering internal promotions, salary\nreviews and regular catch-ups with their teams.\u201d_\n\n* * *\n\n####  **About CV-Library**\n\n_[CV-Library](https://www.cv-library.co.uk)_ is one of the UK\u2019s largest online\njob sites and attracts over 4.3 million unique job seekers every month.\nFounded by Lee Biggins in 2000, CV-Library is the UK\u2019s leading independent\nonline job board with a database of over 12 million CVs.\n\n####  [www.cv-library.co.uk](https://www.cv-library.co.uk)\n\nRelated company:\n\n![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/cv-library_5.png)\n\nPremium[CV-Library.co.uk](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)[View\nprofile](/directory/job-boards/cv-librarycouk)\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Related News\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_26.jpg?itok=rTPIU1S0)](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-application-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n    * 03 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Partnerships](/category/events/news)\n\n### [CV-Library announces new job posting and application integration with\nX0PA Ai ](/news/partnerships/cv-library-announces-new-job-posting-and-\napplication-integration-with-x0pa-ai)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/cvl_blue_logo_2.jpg?itok=WPyH9nD6)](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-clients)\n\n    * 02 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Launch](/category/events/news-0)\n\n### [CV-Library introduces new video interviewing functionality for clients\n](/news/launch/cv-library-introduces-new-video-interviewing-functionality-for-\nclients)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_25.jpg?itok=yFT5DOYn)](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-experts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n    * 31 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [Statistics](/category/events/news-2)\n\n### [Brits scramble for immediate work, as experts warn unemployment rate\ncould double in Q3 ](/news/statistics/brits-scramble-for-immediate-work-as-\nexperts-warn-unemployment-rate-could-double-in)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/21_24.jpg?itok=POC0Y_V9)](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-driving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n    * 24 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [Job searches surge in driving, retail and healthcare industries, as UK\nworkers react to employer demand](/news/news-archive/job-searches-surge-in-\ndriving-retail-and-healthcare-industries-as-uk-workers-react)\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

What\u2019s more, 41.5%\nsaid they aren\u2019t currently working in their desired field, potentially\ncontributing towards their dissatisfaction at work.\n\nThe survey of 1,100 UK workers compiled a list of some of the most popular\njobs across the nation. Respondents were then asked to vote for which job\nthey\u2019d like to have if there were no restrictions (e.g qualifications). The\nresults revealed that the most desirable jobs in the UK right now are:\n\n  * Teacher \u2013 **18.3%**\n  * Designer \u2013 **17.1%**\n  * Office Manager \u2013 **16.8%**\n  * IT Technician \u2013 **15%**\n  * Accountant \u2013 **12.8%**\n  * Athlete \u2013 **12.5%**\n  * Mechanical Engineer \u2013 **12.3%**\n  * Recruiter \u2013 **11.7%**\n  * Brand Manager \u2013 **10.9%**\n  * Journalist \u2013 **10.7%**\n\n####  **Lee Biggins, founder and managing director of**[ **CV-\nLibrary**](https://www.cv-library.co.uk) **comments:**\n\n_\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see that being a teacher came top of the list given the\nongoing staff shortages in the industry right now. It\u2019s also great to see that\nsome of the more traditional occupations such as accountant, technician and\nrecruiter made the list._\n\n_\u201cWith the introduction of new technologies and the ever-growing popularity of\nfreelance work, it can often feel like some of the key professions such as\nhealthcare are being disregarded. Instead, it\u2019s clear that many workers are\nopting for online roles, such as brand manager, instead.\u201d_\n\nDespite over a third (37.5%) of professionals confessing that they\u2019d be more\nlikely to take a job that had the word \u2018manager\u2019 in the title, almost half\n(44.4%) agreed that having fun at work and enjoying your job is more important\nthan your salary.\n\n**Biggins concludes:** _\u201cIt\u2019s good to see that job satisfaction is a priority\nfor many of the nation\u2019s professionals. In today\u2019s uncertain economy, it can\nbe all too easy to focus on money and making a living; but we spend a great\ndeal of our time at work so it\u2019s important that we enjoy what we do._\n\n_**\u201c**_ _No matter what industry you operate in, employers need to ensure that\nthey\u2019re doing their best to create a great company culture and keep staff\nhappy and motivated.

Even employees who are devoted to their job will eventually\nsuffer from burn out. Consider what you can do to help your workers make smart\nchoices for their wellbeing: whether it\u2019s discussing flexible working options\nor encouraging them to leave work on time.
