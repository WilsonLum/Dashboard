_Austin-based startup simplifies acquiring workers\u2019 compensation insurance_\n\nOn April 3, 2020, Cerity Insurance Company (Cerity), a direct to small\nbusiness workers\u2019 compensation carrier, launched their fully automated and\naffordable online purchasing platform in the state of California. Small\nbusinesses can now take advantage of the lower prices and affordable billing\noptions provided through direct purchase. This increases the number of states\nserved by Cerity to thirty-nine, with two additional states scheduled to\nlaunch later this quarter.\n\n\"Businesses across the U.S. are facing unprecedented challenges. We're excited\nto bring our digital insurance platform to California businesses during this\ncritical time as our products directly reduce business expenses and increase\nbilling flexibility. Cerity offers complete protection at an affordable price,\nwith a team of licensed agents and 24/7 online access to important policy\ndocuments,\" said Tracey Berg, President of Cerity. \"We\u2019re seeing more and more\nbusiness owners looking to quickly reduce expenses, increase flexibility as\ntheir payroll fluctuates, and use online insurance platforms like ours.\"\n\nThe company received written approval to sell in California on April 2, and\nlaunched the next day. Berg continued, \"Our team moves quickly. Every piece of\nour tech stack is modern and scalable, which guarantees we can move faster and\noffer more features than traditional agents and carriers.\"\n\nCerity also recently released two new products designed to help small business\nowners.\n\nThe first,\n[PayGoTM](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcerity.com%2Fpaygo%2F&esheet=52200597&newsitemid=20200408005175&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=PayGoTM&index=1&md5=3586b106f1258d54ae07d372c592634b), is a fully\nautomated pay-as-you-go billing solution that works with all major payroll\nplatforms. Unlike traditional workers\u2019 comp plans that require annual payroll\nestimations, large up-front fees, and painful year-end audits, PayGo relies on\nreal-time payroll calculations, resulting in more accurate monthly payments\nthat adjust automatically to a changing small business. With no money down,\ncash flow advantages, and automated payment processing, PayGo has rapidly\ngrown in popularity with small to medium sized businesses.\n\nThe second,\n[PIXTM](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcerity.com%2Fpix-\nworkers-comp-for-payroll-\npartners%2F&esheet=52200597&newsitemid=20200408005175&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=PIXTM&index=2&md5=e448eba4a4fdaf784bca765f79c7bdd7), or Partner\nInsurance Exchange, is available to business professionals, affiliate\nplatforms, and associations who work with and advise their clients and\nmembers. Enrolled partners gain access to Cerity\u2019s Business Growth EngineTM, a\nsuite of tools designed to quickly and easily educate their clients about the\nbenefits of Cerity. These tools enable partners to offer a digital workers\u2019\ncompensation option for their clients and members, with Cerity serving as the\nlicensed agent. \"Payroll and accounting professionals are in a unique position\nto educate their clients and help them save money on insurance, but most are\nnot licensed,\" said Dennis Dix, SVP, Chief Operating Officer at Cerity. \"We\ncurrently fill that void for independent payroll providers and are excited to\nexpand our PIX program to affiliations, associations, and franchises to help\nthem continue to add value and grow membership.\"\n\nTo learn more about Cerity, visit\n[www.cerity.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerity.com&esheet=52200597&newsitemid=20200408005175&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=www.cerity.com&index=3&md5=f6d23a3e2e13d0ee8e9688c488c9bc5a).\n\n **About Cerity**\n\nFounded with a bold vision to reimagine small business insurance, Cerity\nempowers business owners to quickly and easily protect their team, their\nassets and their livelihood through an online workers compensation solution.\nWith its digital-first approach, Cerity is transforming the entire process -\nfrom purchasing and maintaining coverage, to filing a claim - to be simple,\nfast, and easy.

Does your mid-sized business need a sophisticated system\nthat uses process automation? Do you need payroll or inventory management\nfeatures? If you already have other systems like ERP, will the accounting\nsoftware integrate with those systems?\n\nThese considerations, as well as usability, vendor support, cost, and the\nsoftware's ability to grow with your business, should all be in your\nevaluation plan.

One\ncharacteristic shared by all of the software packages that we evaluated was\nthat pricing was based on use. This helps ensure that companies get the best\nvalue for their money since they only pay for what they consume.\n\nBeyond that, different accounting software offerings have different strengths.\n\nAll accounting software packages address the core functionality of accounting,\nsuch as income and expenses, receivables and payables, but some software is\nricher in functionality than others.\n\nThere is accounting software that has an integrated payroll function, which is\nimportant for companies that must issue paychecks or direct deposits to\nemployees. In other cases, the accounting software includes international\ncapabilities, such as multi-currency processing, processing intelligence of\nother countries' accounting regulations, and the ability to accept and remit\nforeign payments.  \n  \nSome software offers customized versions for specific industry verticals; and\nsoftware that is designed for companies where project management is an\nintegral part of their business. For organizations with in-house accounting\nexpertise, there is also software that provides process automation for\nrepetitive functions, such as invoice processing, and that feature artificial\nintelligence and machine learning.  \n  \nThese accounting packages also have varying abilities to integrate with other\nin-house systems such as ERP, office management, inventory management, and\nproject management. Some feature large libraries of application programming\ninterfaces (APIs) and even the opportunity to custom develop interfaces to\nother software; while other packages are very basic and offer little\nintegration -- but they can do the job for a sole proprietor or very small\nbusiness at an attractive price point.  \n  \nThis broad spectrum of accounting functionality makes it important for\ncompanies to evaluate both their current and anticipated accounting needs\nupfront and to develop a written set of accounting software requirements\nbefore they go shopping for software.  \n  \nEqually important is software that has a short learning curve and is easy to\nuse, especially for smaller organizations that lack internal accounting\nexpertise.  \n  \nUsability considerations include an attractive user interface (UI), screen\nfunctions that are easy and intuitive to navigate, and also the ability to\naccess the software from a plurality of devices that range from desktop\ncomputers to mobile smartphones and tablets.  \n  \nWe also looked at vendor support for the software. Did the vendor offer 24/7\nservice? Was online documentation helpful? Did users also have access to\nprofessional consulting services if they wanted them?  \n  \nCollectively, these criteria identified certain software packages that were\n\"best fits\" for companies in different situations -- from sole proprietors and\none-person shops to small- and mid-size companies that could scale up to\nenterprise-level organizations.

Ga., April 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- MicroBilt launched an automated\nsolution that allows the lending market to acquire and validate payroll while\nutilizing their current applications to verify bank account statements and\nbusiness organization data required for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).\n\n[![\\(PRNewsfoto/MicroBilt\\)](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![\\(PRNewsfoto/MicroBilt\\)](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4MeZIfNgKdOBWw_8.bsVOw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/65a6ba573e1ac4a6b0c9eae7863c958f)(PRNewsfoto/MicroBilt)More](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/845534/Microbilt_Logo.html)\n\nA pioneer in risk assessment and mitigation, \"MicroBilt wants to help get\nmoney faster to those who need loans through the Small Business Administration\n(SBA) and is providing the resources to lenders for qualified borrowers under\nthe new Paycheck Protection Program that went into effect April 3, 2020\", said\nWalt Wojciechowski (CEO).\n\nThe program, initiated by the U.S. Treasury will provide $350 billion in fully\nforgivable loans to small business owners to enable them to maintain payroll\nduring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, shoring up a key financial stressor on\ncompanies. The loans are fully forgivable if they are used to cover payroll\ncosts and other allowable expenses, providing very important relief for small\nbusinesses. While vague guidelines exist, the actual facilitation of these\nloans is complicated and mostly manual at best.\n\nMicroBilt will provide lenders across the country key information including:\n\n  * Payroll Validation (940, 941,944,1099-MISC) & payroll reports directly from payroll companies \n  * Bank account statements directly from financial institutions \n  * Business organization data verification \n  * Application data verification & more\n\nThe solution is available now and lenders can access directly from the\nMicroBilt website or integrate the platform into their application. In\naddition, the company is providing live in-person call center support to\nensure easy access and streamlined communication throughout the process.\nMicroBilt is dedicated to providing a safe and secure method for managing\nthese key application documents.\n\nFor more information on the Paycheck Protection Program:\n_[https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-\noptions/paycheck-protection-program-\nppp](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2771694-1&h=1457142094&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sba.gov%2Ffunding-\nprograms%2Floans%2Fcoronavirus-relief-options%2Fpaycheck-protection-program-\nppp&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sba.gov%2Ffunding-programs%2Floans%2Fcoronavirus-\nrelief-options%2Fpaycheck-protection-program-ppp)_\n\nABOUT MICROBILT - MicroBilt has been a pioneer in data and risk management\nservices for nearly 40 years.

Well-\nconstructed solutions including free benefit administration, plus proven\nintegrations for services and benefits, result in excellent outcomes with more\nflexibility and lower cost. These solutions continually improve, increasing\ntheir value.\n\nWith a free benefits administration solution, each party profits from\ncollaboration. Brokers and their clients can save a lot of money and enjoy\nhigh-quality benefit administration, or obtain benefit administration for a\nwide range of situations. Comparisons from independent sources such as\nCapterra bear this out.\n\nLet\u2019s challenge additional misconceptions stated in Burkett\u2019s article:\n\n1\\. \u201cFree benefits administration solutions are often difficult to integrate\ninto existing HR systems and, as a result, may do little to improve\nprocesses,\u201d she writes.\n\nFree solutions have been available for more than 20 years. The software can\ncoordinate with dozens of HRIS platforms. However, eliminating the benefit\nadministration module typically saves $5 to $7 per employee per month. Clients\nreceive a payroll file (often automated) instead _._\n\n2\\. \u201cAn employer may give up a significant amount of control over employee\ndata and strategic management of benefit plans,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nFree solutions can provide HR total control of all plan design and access.\nClients can schedule automated payroll file transfer to both HR and broker,\nwith confirmations for both sent and failed transfers.\n\n3\\. \u201cAn employer that relies on a free benefits administration solution also\nmay struggle to sever ties with the owner of the technology if a decision is\nmade to partner with other carriers or even change consultants in the future.\nSince a consultant or carrier in such an arrangement owns the technology, the\ncompany can lose electronic access to their benefits administration solution\nand all the current and historical data, requiring an employer to collect all\nnew data from employees,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nContractual solutions exist, eliminating this concern. These contracts include\n\u201cflexible but standard\u201d free data transfer on termination. If a client wants a\ncustom export, there is a reasonable fee, typically not more than $600.\n\n4\\. \u201cAutomated data file feeds between payroll/HR systems and the free\nbenefits administration solution are not widely available or often limited,\nwhich can impact data integrity,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nSolutions provide robust export tools. When asked to compare the renewal\nprocess from a well-known competitor, the free system did in one minute what\nthe other program required a full hour of tedious data reentry to accomplish.\n\n5\\. \u201cWhile the data can be shared between systems with manual bulk imports and\nexports, these processes are challenging to adopt, and many HR teams end up\nentering the data by hand,\u201d Burkett says.\n\nA free solution has sophisticated tools, including the ability to build and\nmaintain 834 EDI files. The solution is hosted in the cloud (Azure), a HITRUST\nenvironment, and the vendor has its own SOC1SAE18 Type II certification.\n\n6\\. \u201cAn organization that receives benefits administration at gratis from\nanother party has no ownership control over the employee data and is at a\nmajor disadvantage if it decides to terminate the relationship,\u201d Burkett\nwrites.\n\nThe contract is with the employer.\n\nThe free solutions offer collaborations including:  \n\n  * Integration with any payroll system (including automated data feeds).\n  * Collaborations with any medical carrier.\n  * Selection from more than 100 voluntary benefits.\n  * Administrative services (FSA, HSA, COBRA).\n  * Wellness strategies (both physical and financial).\n  * Single, side login with health assessment.\n  * Dependent and claim auditing.\n\nIn addition to the huge portfolio of discounted collaborating services\navailable, some free solutions can integrate with any system (insurance\ncarrier, payroll, third-party administrator, etc.).\n\nHR enjoys more options with each vendor (ACA, FSA, voluntary benefits) rther\nthan packages with expensive alternatives. That is because the core of the\nsystem, benefit administration, is free. In my view, the savings an employer\ncan realize using free benefit administration is significant. There is no\nsacrifice of control or capability, and the free system, with a bilingual\nself-service platform, improves engagement, an essential but often overlooked\ncomponent.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba08200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/91x91+0+15/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fb9%2F14%2F5047ec634484927223f99cffb23b%2Fdfreund.jpg)\n](https://www.employeebenefitadviser.com/author/daniel-freund)\n\n[Daniel

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/waterfall-effects-of-integrated-\nsmb-accounting/) __\n\nAutomation in[small business accounting](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/small-\nbusiness-accounting/) can certainly be beneficial, but when a cloud-based\naccounting platform remains within the confines of its own interface, there\ncan be unexpected friction that prevents business owners from gaining real-\ntime financial insights.\n\nThat's because the more software solutions a business implements, the more\nplatforms there are for accountants, payroll professionals, financial\nexecutives and others in the enterprise to toggle between, opening up the\nopportunity for manual data entry, recording errors and wasted time.\n\nIndeed, while [accounting digitization](https://www.pymnts.com/accounts-\npayable/2020/ap-automation-virtual-cards-and-accounting-nirvana/) can solve\nmany challenges, it can create new ones that impede the ROI of these\ntechnologies.\n\nKapil Rana, president of small business cloud accounting platform\n[HostBooks](https://www.hostbooks.com/), told PYMNTS that there are several\nways in which accounting software can augment its capabilities to better serve\nthe needs of SMBs. But as functionality expands, what is perhaps more\nimportant is that accounting solutions can co-exist with other back-office\nplatforms.\n\nData integration, he said, can have a waterfall effect with wide-ranging\nefficiencies.\n\n **Elevating Functionality**\n\nMigrating the accounting function to the cloud can offer a slew of benefits\nfor small businesses, thanks to the flexibility of software to operate across\nplatforms. It's what enabled HostBooks to recently\n[announce](https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/511105754/hostbooks-automated-\ncloud-accounting-software-for-financial-professionals-and-small-business-\nowners-is-expanding-market) the launch of its mobile app, a key feature for\nSMBs that must gain access to financial data regardless of location, said\nRana.\n\nHe noted that more small businesses will continue to embrace the cloud\nmigration of accounting.\n\n\"By moving to the cloud, you don't have to deal with downloading, installing,\nupdating and maintaining the software and servers used,\" Rana said, also\npointing to the added benefit of \"decreased risk of data loss\" as servers\nautomate data backups and security.\n\nThe reduction of manual workloads is among the largest benefits for small\nbusiness owners who lack the resources and extra staff to key in data and\ncrunch numbers. But the accounting function does not exist in a vacuum, and\nits relationship to other aspects of running a business must be recognized in\norder to obtain the full benefit of cloud-based platforms.\n\n **Siloed Platforms**\n\nAccounting is part of a wave of [cloud-\nbased](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/corporates-cloud-\ncomputing-accounting-changes-fasb/) enterprise software solutions helping to\ndigitize corporate financial processes, but the accelerated adoption of\nmultiple portals means significant friction in having to move data from one\ntool to the next.\n\nBy expanding accounting platforms' functionality, software can help to remedy\nthis challenge, said Rana, while [data\nintegration](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/complete-\ncontroller-data-integration-accounting/) across other platforms like payroll,\nAP and AR are essential to financial transparency.\n\n\"It is not efficient or smart to have separate accounts to track bills,\ninvoices, payroll, expenses and more,\" he noted. \"Separate accounts will not\ngive business owners the trust understanding of the health of their business.\nFactors such as [accounts payable](https://www.pymnts.com/category/accounts-\npayable/), accounts receivable, payroll and expenses need to be collectively\ngathered as a whole to see the true financial state of a business.\"\n\nA lack of integration elevates the risk of data entry errors, and the more\nportals that have been deployed, the higher the risk of making a mistake,\nadded Rana.\n\nThis understanding is also the motivation behind another new feature\n[HostBooks](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/small-business-\naccounting-data-automation/) recently announced, which enables the platform to\nintegrate with SMBs' payroll solutions. Rana said this connectivity is key for\nfinancial reporting and tax filing.\n\n\"Lack of integration can mean a major gap in financial statements, and, as a\nresult, impacts tax returns,\" he noted. \"With payroll integration, speed of\ncompletion increases because authorized persons from different departments\nhave easy access to the same data they need to work.\"\n\n **A Waterfall Effect**\n\nEvery business is different, so it's not feasible to assume that a single\nsoftware solution can provide all the functionality one business needs to\nmanage money, from payroll to AP.\n\nBut data integration can reduce the number of software platforms being used\nand cut through the data silos standing in the way of financial visibility.\nAccounting is in a particularly opportunistic position to achieve this\nefficiency, according to Rana.\n\n\"[Accounting automation](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/ap-\nautomation-braces-for-open-banking-globalization/) brings centralization to\ncreating invoices, accepting payments and updating financial books,\" he said,\nnoting that because accounting touches so many other areas of finance,\nautomation and data integration can have a waterfall effect of benefits.\n\nThat includes accelerated [order-to-\ncash](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payments-innovation/2019/how-order-to-cash-\neases-cash-flow-woes/) cycles, with automation allowing for faster generation\nand submission of invoices and, therefore, faster incoming payments. Data\nconnectivity means AR teams can automatically receive notifications about\noverdue invoices, further reducing the need for manual work.\n\nIt's only one example of how cloud-based, integrated and automated accounting\ncan introduce benefits for small business owners who are strapped for\nresources.\n\n\"Small business financial management is definitely heading toward an\nintegrated ecosystem because of the simple fact that it allows for increased\nefficiency and reduced cost of resources and errors,\" said Rana. \"In an\nintegrated software, all accounting and compliance outcomes are available on\none platter, leading to faster and smarter decision-making.\"\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

\n\n![](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/600x360/news/01ASPIRE_0.jpg)\n\n# VCs bet big on ESG startups\n\n_Investments in the urban solutions and sustainability domain surged 56% over\nlast year._\n\nIn the ninth edition of _Singapore Business Review_ 's 20 Hottest Startups, it\nwas the small and medium enterprise (SME)-focused neobank Aspire that clinched\nthe top spot, with $45.03m (US$32.5m) in funding from a series A round.\nFollowing closely is invisible braces manufacturer Zenyum, having secured\n$18.84m (US$13.6m) in a series A funding. Closing the top three is proptech\nstartup Smarten Spaces, with its $12.47m (US$9m) funding last year.\n\nOther startups that joined the ranks include Quilt.ai ($12.47m), Sleek\n($6.93m), eko.ai ($5.54m), Syfe ($5.27m), Draper Startup House ($4.85m), Yours\n($4.85m), Travelstop ($4.16m), Osome ($4.16m), SEPPURE ($3.53m), atlan\n($3.46m), CHILD Health Imprints ($3.19m), Keyless ($3.05m), gush ($2.91m),\nNovelship ($2.84m), COVE ($2.78m), abillionveg ($2.78m), and Hydroleap\n($2.6m).\n\nThese 20 startups raised an average funding amount of about $7.85m, which was\na 47.32% plunge from the 2018 average of $14.9m.\n\n**ESG grabs spotlight**  \nEven though this year's list shows that deeptech startups are still dominant,\ngiven the Government's efforts to boost the flexibility of its operations in\nSingapore, investors are turning their heads to startups that are focussed on\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). This comes on the back\nof increasing awareness towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly\nsolutions.\n\nFor instance, 12th placer SEPPURE offers chemical separation processes that\ncan be done without heat and at 90% less energy. It claims this can\npotentially conserve billions of gallons of water, millions of tonnes in\nvolatile organic compound emissions, and billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide\nemissions annually.\n\nAnother sustainable startup is abillionveg, a platform that allows users to\nsearch for highly reviewed plant-based food and where to find it around the\nglobe.\n\nIn Enterprise Singapore's study, investments in the urban solutions and\nsustainability domain surged 56% YoY during 9M 2019 to $150.4m, which can be\nattributed to increasing attention on cleantech and sustainability.\n\nSpecifically, the report noted that there is a growing interest in agri-food\ntech startups in this sector, where investment reached $28.3m, up from just\n$0.75m in the same period of 2018. This is said to be in line with the\ngovernment's push to develop Singapore into a leading food and nutrition hub\nin Asia. SEEDS Capital, Enterprise Singapore's investment arm, appointed seven\nco-investment partners in January 2019 to catalyse more than $90m worth of\ninvestments into agri-food tech startups.\n\n\"ESG investments are gaining traction because many of the limited partners\nhave realised that for long-term growth, ESG is an important pillar and whilst\nmany investments may not tick off each of the 'E', 'S' and 'G', starting off\nwith at least one criterion, it can lead to expanding the investment to\nothers,\" vice chairman of Business Angel Network of Southeast Asia (BANSEA)\n**Ramesh Raghavan** said.\n\nEngagement from foundations and institutional investors, such as pension\nfunds, is also starting to become more interested in long-term impact over\nshort-term gains as well.\n\n**Deeptech still at the helm**  \nIn Enterprise Singapore's latest figures on the startup scene, total\ninvestments from January to September 2019 hit $13.4b across 437 deals,\njumping 36% YoY from 2018. It noted that deeptech startups under advanced\nmanufacturing, urban solutions and sustainability, and healthcare and\nbiomedical sciences started to gain traction during this period, with\ninvestments in these three domains amounting to $416.4m across 76 deals. This\nrepresents a 25% YoY uptrend from $333.8m in 2018.\n\nHowever, these three sectors only make up 4% of the total capital invested due\nto the current ecosystem's lack of lead investors with the expertise and\nexperience to back deeptech startups.\n\n\"They must find new growth engines, including but not limited to regional\nexpansion,\" co-founder and managing director of East Ventures **Wilson Cuaca**\ncommented.\n\n\"The key focus is a road to profitability and startups should show much better\ncapital efficiency in their business models. Keeping customer acquisition cost\nlow and not looking for growth for growth's sake will be key,\" Raghavan added.\n\nApart from these figures, the same study mentioned that the number of\ninvestments made into digital tech startups skyrocketed 91.7% YoY to 278\ndeals, from 145 deals over the same period last year, which accounts for 93.2%\nof the total quantum.\n\nIn terms of funding rounds, early stage funding during the first three\nquarters of 2019 doubled to $886.1m across 304 deals compared to 2018 figures,\nwhilst growth stage funding amounts edged up 33% YoY to reach $12.5b with 83\ndeals.\n\n**VC funds go low-key**  \nOverall, venture capital (VC) firms cited a number of reasons as to why\ninvestment activity amongst startups seemingly quietened down in H2 2019.\n\nInvestment opportunities in Singapore still abound, according to Golden Gate\nVenture's principal **Justin Hall**. \"Many fundraising rounds go unannounced,\nthey're lumped into other rounds, or there are any other number of reasons\nthat might affect total funding. The truth is that the number of investable\nopportunities in Singapore and abroad has continued unabated,\" he said.\n\nEast Ventures' Cuaca added that investments also went to other emerging\nmarkets, such as Indonesia, where the ease of doing business has improved.\n\nIn contrast, Raghavan observed that overall funding in the ASEAN region,\nincluding Singapore, went down. Larger firms such as Grab have raised less\ncapital, whilst startups' need for financing also dipped.\n\nRaghavan also noted that issues around WeWork and its fundraising became a\nmajor wake-up call for investors and startups alike, noting that it was a big\nmoment for cash-burning startups.\n\n\"The WeWork saga also made investors a bit more cautious in jumping in wildly\nat expensive valuations,\" Raghavan said. \"Larger startups are focused on\nturning to profitability and less cash burn. Smaller startups have realised\nthat raising capital at extended valuations is not easy anymore and are\ntherefore focused on generating traction in a capital-efficient way.\"\n\nIn 2019, coworking firm WeWork pulled back its initial public offering plan in\nthe US, as investors had begun to question its profitability. Its valuation\nplunged from $67b (US$47b) to $14.25b (US$10b) and its biggest backer Softbank\ntook over from ousted co-founder Adam Neumann.\n\nAnother issue BANSEA's Raghavan cited was the souring investments on\ncryptocurrency-based startups. The industry has gone past its 2017 hype and\nits regulatory environment is still deemed unstable by many analysts, he said.\n\n\"Poor liquidity environment, uncertain regulatory outlook, lack of\ntransparency and issues of trust continue to hamper adaptability which is the\nkey driver for growth and there has been little movement in [the\ncryptocurrency] space. Time is of the essence here and if we get a common\nregulatory framework and transparent and interoperable exchanges and\ninfrastructure we will see improvement in more widespread network effect and\ngrowth,\" he explained.\n\nOn the other hand, the Singapore government is still launching programmes to\nsupport deeptech startups. During the Budget 2020 speech, Deputy Prime\nMinister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat announced the Startup SG\nEquity scheme, where the government will co-invest into eligible startups,\nalongside private third-party investors\n\nThe investment cap for each startup in the general tech industries is set at\n$2m, whilst deeptech firms may clinch up to $4m in the scheme. SEEDS Capital\nand SGInnovate have been appointed to manage the funds under Startup SG\nEquity.\n\nMoving forward, Cuaca has a positive outlook on Singapore's overall startup\nscene, regardless of the industry they are in. \"Most sectors are growing now\nbecause the region is hitting an inflection point,\" he said. \"Anyone who\nstarted in Singapore must quickly see the broader South East Asia and\nshouldn't stay in Singapore too long.\"\n\n\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/01ASPIRE.jpg)\n\n**1\\.

Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase\nArticle](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=04/07/2020&title=Managing\nrisk as an SME during uncertainty)\n\nPermalink: https://str.sg/Jg4N Copy\n\nHow am I going to pay staff and suppliers when I know my sales and revenue are\nabout to get hit? I have cash to last another three months, and then what?\nWill we lose business because we can't get our staff across borders?\n\nThese are some questions being posed by many of Singapore's 200,000 small and\nmedium-sized enterprises that are exposed to the extreme economic conditions\ncaused by Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith sluggish revenues, tightening liquidity and a freeze on travel, here are\nsome suggestions that SMEs should be considering to manage their risk,\nliquidity and cash management approach.\n\n#### GET CASH MANAGEMENT RIGHT\n\nThese steps might seem simple, but they are often overlooked.\n\nThey include planning ahead to evaluate upcoming cash inflows and outflows\n,and being diligent in preparing invoices. Monitoring the collection of\nreceivables and real time reconciliation also gives a clear and true\nunderstanding of a business' cash position.\n\nOnce businesses have this nailed down, they will be in a far better position\nto make informed decisions on whether they should be borrowing to supplement\ntheir working capital.\n\n#### TAP SUPPORT MEASURES\n\nClients who in the past have a lot of cash must not be complacent. If they\nstill have ability to tap on loans, they should do so.\n\nThe Singapore Government has announced $59.9 billion of fiscal stimulus, or\nabout 12 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP). There are\nsupport measures for enterprises which each business owner need to be aware\nof. Notably, the a number of measures originally introduced at the Budget\nStatement in February were beefed up significantly.\n\nThe SME Working Capital Loan has increased from $600,000 to $1 million, and\nthe Government said yesterday it will raise the risk share of loans to 90 per\ncent, enabling us as a bank to widen the breadth of our book beyond normal\nrisk thresholds to extend liquidity and repayment flexibility to our clients.\n\nThe Temporary Bridging Loan Programme has now been expanded to all sectors and\nenables borrowing up to $5 million.\n\nSMEs that have already tapped the working capital loan can now lean into the\nbridging loan programme for additional headroom.\n\nThere are several other measures which can be leveraged as well, including the\none-year deferment of capital payments and the Enhanced Loan Insurance Scheme.\n\n#### CONSIDER LIQUIDITY, CREDIT AND FX EXPOSURE\n\nThe current conditions are having a significant impact on foreign exchange\nfluctuations, liquidity and credit availability. While it is too soon to know\nhow the situation will pan out, consider the following:\n\n\u2022 In times of headwinds, businesses can be faced with a cash crunch so it is\nimportant to assess if there is enough liquidity for the foreseeable future or\nif one needs to borrow or raise capital.\n\n\u2022 If borrowing is necessary, then what will the future cost of borrowing be?\nKnowing the maturity dates of any existing loans is critical too. If\nrefinancing is required, start those discussions with lenders early to remove\nthe uncertainty over credit availability and its cost.\n\n\u2022 Companies may consider making alternative arrangements for themselves or\nsuppliers in order to remain buoyant, such as shifting supply from or sales to\nother countries. This raises the need to understand changes in foreign\nexchange (FX) exposure and reassess how the attendant risks are being managed\nand value protected.\n\n#### ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OPTIONS\n\nThere are alternative solutions that can help release cash previously caught\nin the sales cycle to cover your day-to-day expenses. Having this cash\nflexibility enables you to pay suppliers faster and to negotiate more\nfavourable terms.\n\nSome of these solutions include receivables finance, which is a financing\narrangement where a business receives finance against the outstanding balances\nof invoices that have been billed, but not yet paid.\n\nSpeak to your bank about whether they offer streamlined receivables finance\nproducts to get access to funding in a faster, simpler manner.\n\nA company can also look at renegotiating the terms of trade, that is, on\nimports or purchases. For example, instead of making advance payments in cash,\nnegotiate for open account terms or issue letters of credit so as not to lock\nup cash unnecessarily.\n\nIf you can't deliver your commitments, talk to your buyers. Big businesses\nwant to keep their supply chains intact and are open to discussions.\n\nConsider supply chain finance, which is a set of automated solutions that\nallows buyers to provide their suppliers with the opportunity to receive early\npayment on approved invoices at a discount.\n\nAnother area is guarantees - some businesses will be experiencing delays in\nreceiving shipping documents from counter parties due to the coronavirus.\nShipping guarantees can be used to smooth the transition of goods.\n\n#### GO DIGITAL\n\nIt is revealing how operationally paper-dependent many companies are in areas\nlike payroll, payments, and authorisation arrangements.\n\nMany of these can and should be shifted to digital and the transition is not\nas overwhelming as expected. In these times, banks are providing extra\nresources to help businesses make this transition.\n\nBut whatever the future is, SMEs which review and manage their risks and have\na clear working understanding of their working capital and liquidity will be\nin a stronger position to weather the storm of uncertainty.\n\n\u2022 The writer is the head of business banking at HSBC Singapore.\n\nHave a question on the coronavirus outbreak?

There are multiple advantages to\nstreamlining your HR functions:\n\n**Saves money and time:** The conventional way of implementing HR-related\ntasks, which relies completely on human efforts, consumes a lot of time and\ncalls for a large amount of money. A feature-packed payroll software system,\non the other hand, allows you to set up automated alerts to notify you\nwhenever it identifies any discrepancies. A sophisticated payroll software\nplatform not only helps save tremendous amounts of time over manual payroll\nprocesses but also eliminates human errors rampant in the manual process of\ndata entry or data collection.\n\n**Simplifies wage calculation:** Payroll software solutions replace monotonous\npayroll processes, such as writing checks by hand, calculating different types\nof payments and perusing spreadsheets. Automated payroll software is capable\nof calculating all types of payments, including bonuses, commissions and wage\ndeductions, among others. What's more, it also saves time by generating\npaychecks automatically. However, you should keep in mind that these processes\nare not completely error-free as the accuracy of the generated results relies\non the accuracy of the input.\n\n **Facilitates easy financial planning:** An automated payroll software\ntransfers funds into the payroll account immediately. Since your employees are\nnotified as soon as their paycheck gets deposited to their account, it\neliminates the need for visiting banks. Automated payroll software also\nminimizes the chances of delayed paychecks that weakens the trust of your\nemployees and may also lead to penalties.\n\n **Generates employee satisfaction:** Satisfied employees are crucial for the\nsuccess of your business and are more productive and engaged. For example,\nautomated [_attendance management\nsoftware_](https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/attendance-management-software)\nmaximizes employee productivity by making sure that leaves and other\nprivileges are properly dispensed. If a manager is unaware when employees are\napplying for PTO, poor leave planning will not only put his/her workforce\nplanning at risk, but will also end up creating manpower shortages on days\nwhen the company is understaffed, thus, overburdening employees and making\nthem dissatisfied.\n\nThe best attendance management software is the one that can be customized as\nper the modification of your business policies. For example, attendance\nmanagement software should allow you to include the different holidays your\ncompany wants to add in addition to the existing official holidays.\n\n **Facilitates accurate timekeeping:** Conventional payroll processes call for\ncalculating hourly wages manually, which is again a time-consuming affair.\nAutomated payroll software can be linked to timesheet systems for recording\nemployee attendance, as well as the total time worked. It automatically\ntransfers data about total hours worked by employees into your payroll system,\nthus simplifying your payroll calculations. It is also capable of making\nnecessary edits when an employee forgets to clock in or out.\n\n **Simplifies tax deduction calculation by minimizing errors:** Tax rules and\nregulations keep changing frequently. Automated payroll software is designed\nto seamlessly calculate taxes for each employee. Consequently, it minimizes\nerrors and saves you from penalties.\n\n **Facilitates easy recordkeeping:** With an automated payroll system, you can\neliminate the need for maintaining tax records manually. Besides generating\nbackups automatically, payroll software is also capable of storing payroll\ndata and employment tax, thus helping you save time and effort.\n\n **Make changes instantaneously:** Manual payroll modifications, such as\nadding new employee data to the system or adding or correcting employees' bank\naccount details, requires your employees to fill up multiple paper forms. With\nautomated payroll software, you can make modifications directly in the system.\nSome payroll platforms allow these changes to be made by the employer as well\nas the employees.\n\n **Maintain consistency across departments:** High-performing payroll software\nhelps you maintain consistency in different departments, thus, keeping\neveryone on the same page. Furthermore, having a centralised HR management\nsoftware keeps employees from different departments updated on your latest HR\npolicies without having to touch base with other offices individually.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of automating payroll processes is the absence\nof in-house payroll skills, compelling organizations to count on payroll\noutsourcing tailored to fit their business. Therefore, before taking the final\nplunge, you need to prepare by upgrading your skills and capabilities for this\nlarge-scale transformation.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f54321/2147483647/strip/true/crop/200x200+0+29/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe9%2F27%2F774fa2134473966449f93e78950a%2Funnamed.png)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/kiran-bajpai)\n\n[Kiran

The country\u2019s strict internet controls\ncan significantly affect the performance of company networks, and its complex\ncybersecurity regulations can make planning and maintaining compliant and\nwell-performing infrastructures very challenging.\n\n[COVID-19](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/how-to-use-chinas-preferential-\npolicies-rolled-out-amid-covid-19/) has now propelled these issues to the\ncrisis forefront for daily operational productivity, cost optimization, and\nsecurity. The unprecedented need of foreign companies based in China to\nsuddenly implement and shift to scaled and adaptable virtual work or\ntelecommuting regimes for nearly all their company processes, means daily\nexposure to a challenging internet ecosystem, and the need to do so\nimmediately and cost effectively.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-\ntechnology-solutions)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Have a question for our technology team?](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-technology-solutions)\n\nTo meet this challenge, companies need to first ensure that their now virtual\nworkforce is enabled with stable and easy collaboration tools and uses\napproved channels, which are properly secured for the communication of\nsensitive data.\n\nMany companies continue to find their systems and networks are not measuring\nup. They must conduct internal reviews of or obtain advisory on their cloud\nand internet infrastructure to identify how to quickly resolve performance,\nwhile ensuring data security and compliance thresholds are not compromised.\n\nYet, while this sudden transition has shocked corporate networks and\ntraditional work systems, solutions for operating virtually are well-\ndeveloped, and highly available. The workplace has, in reality, already become\nvirtual-friendly or digitalized. A clear opportunity exists for companies to\nshift their corporate work processes online, from easy and complete company\ncommunications and scheduling, to digitalizing and possibly automating their\nback-office operations in China. The scope can encompass HR, payroll, finance,\nand accounting processes \u2013 all can be achieved in both English and Chinese.\n\nWhat the COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated therefore, is the growing awareness\nthat such solutions exist and can be harnessed to scale up productivity.\nEntire departments can be made more efficient, and costs reduced. These\nsolutions have never before been in such high demand.\n\nIn part one of this three-part article series, we briefly discuss workforce\ncollaboration, digital accounting, and expenses management. These topics are\nvery relevant as the crisis continues to disrupt normal operations, but are\nalso equally critical to your business\u2019 sustainable performance long after the\npandemic ends.\n\n## Working via the cloud: What does it mean and what are the solutions?\n\nVirtual work and remote collaboration have long been a part of the corporate\nlandscape. In recent years, digitalization and integration have vastly\nexpanded the scope of what can be achieved remotely. Nowadays, most areas of a\ncompany\u2019s administrative operations can be managed by moving to a more\nefficient online process. Unsurprisingly, flexible software is at the core of\nalmost all of the new solutions on the market today.\n\nOften deployed via software-as-a-service (SaaS), this cloud technology can\nincreasingly leverage different parts of an organization to improve its\nproductivity and efficiency, while promoting transparency. Cloud services\ndelivered as SaaS are provided over the internet, on a subscription basis, and\nminimize the need to invest in servers, networks, backup strategies, and other\nmajor infrastructure.\n\n## How cloud technology works in China\n\nIn China, data centers that store and connect user data are distinct from\nglobal networks, and in a sense they are isolated. Although cloud-users\noutside of China communicate and collaborate with their China-based\ncolleagues, both must use separate user accounts and cannot typically access\ncompany data from a common source. Similarly, companies headquartered outside\nof China can manage China-based company systems and data by using a China user\naccount. Also, some cloud service providers, such as Google, simply do not\nfunction reliably or at all in China.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-\ntechnology-solutions)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Learn more about our technology advisory services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-technology-solutions)\n\nFor this reason, it is essential that companies carefully choose not only the\nprovider for delivering their China cloud services, but also how and where\ntheir data and cloud services will be set up by that provider, to ensure their\ncontinued performance, compliance, and security.\n\n[Thomas Zhang](https://www.dezshira.com/personnel/thomas-zhang.html), IT\nDirector at Dezan Shira & Associates says, \u201ccloud technology has remained a\nrelatively closed industry in China. While this can create obfuscation and\nfrustration for foreign companies during the initial set up and\nfamiliarization phase, it does not hinder the overwhelming benefits of using\nthe cloud in China.\u201d\n\nOur article \u201c[COVID-19: Which IT Systems to Deploy to Assist Employees Working\nfrom Home](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-systems-deploy-assist-\nemployees-working-home/)\u201d discusses some of the most popular cloud and hybrid-\ncloud computing systems currently adopted in China. One of the biggest players\nin the market is Microsoft.\n\n### Microsoft Cloud in China\n\nCompanies that use cloud services in China often do so for reasons of\nperformance, or because they must store data on the mainland to comply with\ngovernment regulations \u2013 and this can be achieved with Microsoft\u2019s China-based\nservices. Microsoft is partnered with China-based 21Vianet to run four data\ncenters in Beijing and Shanghai, providing customers with compliant services\nand fast connectivity between Chinese offices.\n\nFurther, Microsoft is the first cloud service provider to announce that their\nChinese data centers are compliant with the European Union\u2019s General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR). Microsoft also hosts data centers around the\nworld, which provide several ways to achieve performance and compliance\nrequirements and meets unique cross-border requirements.\n\nMicrosoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 have been combined to form one\ncomprehensive ecosystem to support business (the so-called \"Microsoft Three\nCloud Strategy\u201d). They are popular among foreign companies in Asia because\nthey offer businesses reliable, accessible, and integrated capabilities at a\nfraction of the cost of building them internally. The ability of the Cloud to\nimmediately open up or switch off capacity as required allows companies the\nflexibility to scale costs and services as its headcount changes, or as its\ndemand for speed and features grows.\n\n#### _Helping with virtual and remote work: Office 365 and Teams_\n\nOffice 365 is a cloud-based productivity SaaS service, offering perhaps the\nworld\u2019s most popular and well-known suite of business process applications. It\nconsists of the familiar \u201cOffice Suite\u201d (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook in\nboth online and on-premise versions), with more flexible and robust cloud-\nbased features and functionality. It also can include newer communication,\nproductivity, and analytics applications.\n\nAmong these, Microsoft Teams is notably able to help many companies better\nface virtual and remote work situations. It is a hub for teamwork with chat,\nscheduling, voice or video meetings and calls, file sharing, and more. Teams\nis integrated fully into Office 365, Outlook, SharePoint, OneNote, OneDrive,\nand dozens of other applications for very easy collaboration. Together, your\nemployees can connect via any device, or from any location, to interact within\ntheir office, their city, or anywhere else in the world, easily and securely\nperforming most communication and productivity tasks.\n\nAdditional tools like the Power Platform (PowerBI, PowerApps, PowerAutomate)\nand SharePoint can add analytics, file and data integration, and automation\ncapabilities, to streamline business processes and provide insights on company\nprocess, performance, and health.\n\nTogether, this suite of apps can assist companies to meet the demands of\noperating digitally, and remotely, by improving internal collaboration,\nmobility, intelligence, and security, within an enterprise level digital\ninfrastructure that is performance and cost scalable. With the right guidance\nabout how to model and migrate to Office 365, you can be up and running, and\nhave your staff trained, in no time.\n\n#### _The robust backbone capabilities of Microsoft Azure in China_\n\nMore IT-oriented readers may wish to know about Azure in China. Azure is a\ncomprehensive set of cloud services that allow developers and IT professionals\nto build, deploy, and manage applications. Azure is a platform as a service\n(PaaS), which means that businesses and individuals can \u2018lease\u2019 digital space\nand tools to build and run applications and websites. Azure offers businesses\nthe option of working completely on the cloud or in a hybrid format \u2013 using\nboth cloud computing and on-premise servers.\n\nAs a PaaS platform, Azure can host scalable websites and apps. Employees can\naccess apps and sites hosted on Azure through nearly any mobile device while\ncompanies can regulate employee access to maintain privacy and security. Azure\nbacks up all data across its data centers, ensuring information remains\nprotected.\n\n#### _Accelerate success with the connected business cloud product\nDynamics365_\n\nDynamics365 applications work seamlessly together for a comprehensive solution\nthat runs your entire business \u2013 including sales, marketing, service,\noperations, and commerce. You\u2019ll get a 360-degree view of your organization to\nuncover the real-time insights that bring better results.\n\n## From traditional accounting to digital expense management\n\n### A review of accounting and expense management\n\nAccounting, finance, and tax management activities are central to the daily\noperation of any enterprise. The work is complex and critical to the success\nof the enterprise \u2013 processing expenses and payments, dealing with costs and\nprofitability, examining statements, and computing tax liability, among other\ntasks. These activities have a fundamental impact on the operational and\nfinancial viability of an enterprise. As a result, businesses today are keen\nto adopt systems that improve the accuracy and cost efficiency of their\nfinance and accounting processes.\n\nIn China, the situation is more complicated for many foreign companies due to\nthe country\u2019s intricate invoice system and rapid pace of tax reform. China\u2019s\ntax authorities mainly rely on local invoices called\n[_fapiao_](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/understanding-chinas-fapiao-\ninvoice-system/), for tax control, collection, inspection, and serving as a\nproof of purchase.\n\nA company\u2019s daily business activity cannot be completed without the ubiquitous\n_fapiao_. They must be issued when making sales and gathered during\nprocurement and expense reimbursement processes. These _fapiao_ hold the\noriginal information and data that enterprises need to conduct accurate\naccounting and tax declarations.\n\nManaging both the gathering of _fapiao_ and the related offsetting of input\nand output VAT as declared on these _fapiao_ adds to the complexity of\naccounts payable (AP) processing work, making it difficult to organize\naccounting data and compute expense management efficiently.\n\n### Challenges of traditional expense management\n\nMost small and medium-size enterprise (SMEs) leaders are familiar with manual\naccounts payable (AP) processes and have experienced frustration with handling\nChina\u2019s _fapiao_. Normally, when an employee incurs fees on behalf of the\ncompany, they must keep the paper _fapiao_ or print the e- _fapiao_ , paste\nthe _fapiao_ onto an A4 paper, and manually submit the _fapiao_ together with\nthe reimbursement report to the approver.\n\nAfter physically receiving the paper _fapiao_ from the employee or the\napprover, the AP staff need to check the authenticity of the _fapiao_ ,\nclarify that the _fapiao_ has not already been claimed or reimbursed, and then\nmanually enter the information on the _fapiao_ into the accounting system and\ntreat it in accordance with [China GAAP](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/china-gaap-vs-u-s-gaap-and-ifrs/).\n\nThey may also need to supplement additional information for group reporting\npurposes. Then they must wait for the approval of the relevant person-in-\ncharge in their company to complete the payment to employees or suppliers.\n\nThe whole manual AP process is inevitably time-consuming and results in\nnumerous challenges:\n\n  * Higher cost \u2013 physical printing of documents and manually pasting _fapiao_.\n  * Low efficiency \u2013 AP team invests time inspecting _fapiao_ , entering data, and seeking approval.\n  * High error rate \u2013 manual data entry causes data errors, loss, and redundancy.\n  * Delay in payment \u2013 long reimbursement periods can result in late or missed payments and may motivate some staff to seek non-compliant shortcuts.\n  * Fraud \u2013 difficulty to verify whether a _fapiao_ was falsely obtained or claimed more than once.\n  * Compliance risk \u2013 tax underpayment due to booking errors puts companies at risk of inspection from tax authorities.\n  * Financial systemic vulnerability \u2013 a lack of data support and delayed information make it hard for leaders to check spending, monitor cash flow, see the liabilities, and formulate budget policies objectively. Owing to these inefficient practices, the AP team is often left to struggle with mountains of paper and duplicated efforts.\n\n## How digital expense management can help to ease manual invoice processes\n\nTo resolve the above manual processing problems, the best solution is to\ndeploy a Digital Expense Management software. A Digital Expense Management App\nis a cloud-based and mobile-enabled software.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/accounting-\nreporting)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Which area of Accounting do you need help with?](https://www.dezshira.com/services/accounting-reporting)\n\nA company\u2019s staff, accounting team, and approving managers can use this app\nseamlessly in both English and Chinese, to better optimize and speed up\nbusiness administration, simplify remote submissions and approvals, and\nminimize expense and approval errors.\n\nIt can be deployed \u2018stand-alone\u2019 as _a complete mobile expense app and\napproval process_ \u2013 which this article will explore. The next article in this\nseries will explain the further benefits of integrating Digital Expense\nManagement with outsourced accounting, and an ERP system to automate\ninformation gathering, reimbursement, and various other accounting functions.\n\n### Mobile scanning of _fapiao_ with automatic data extraction and\nreimbursement approvals\n\nWhen an employee incurs an expense and needs reimbursement, the employee can\nscan the paper _fapiao_ and upload it directly to the portal using their\nmobile phone. The software identifies most _fapiao_ types by using optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) or QR code technology. This helps to digitize the\n_fapiao_ and creates electronic _fapiao_ files in company record systems.\nStaff can then submit all uploaded _fapiao_ for review and approval anytime \u2013\nanywhere.\n\nAP workers and managers can track and monitor the reimbursement or payment\nprogress online at any time. Reimbursement reviews and approvals are made via\nthe mobile app or via a computer browser. The solution also works for\nstreamlining vendor payment processes in the same manner.\n\n### Automatic real-time _fapiao_ verification and enhanced expense information\n\nThe uploaded _fapiao_ is automatically checked and verified with China\u2019s State\nTax Administration (STA) system. This avoids _fapiao_ duplicates and the VAT\ncredit is also calculated, which helps to avoid calculation errors and reduces\na company\u2019s exposure to fraud.\n\nSome digital expense management applications integrate directly with popular\nChina travel and ride-hailing services such as Ctrip and Didi. Electronic\n_fapiao_ s can automatically be pulled through from these service vendor\nplatforms into the expense management apps, to more efficiently help detail an\nexpense for reimbursement validation.\n\nAs a result, Digital Expense Management apps help to digitize your expense\nprocess and records, increase internal control, and render the expense\napprovals and related accounting processes quicker and more seamless, using\nreal-time information.\n\nThe solution is inexpensive for companies to adopt. Those with complex chart\nof accounts (expenses categories) can obtain expert assistance to customize\nthe platform to suit them. Companies with simpler requirements can deploy the\nsolution in days and receive training and support to help with their rapid\nadoption.\n\n## This is the right time to leverage IT solutions in China\n\nIn conclusion, now during COVID-19, is the time to digitize and optimize your\nprocesses in [China](https://www.dezshira.com/office/china). Making decisions\namid China\u2019s cyberspace environment can be difficult for foreign businesses,\nand yet options exist with the right guidance.\n\nTools to [enhance functions](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/covid-19-systems-deploy-assist-employees-working-home/),\nsuch as workforce communications and collaboration or expense management, are\naccessible, reliable, quick to deploy and cost effective \u2013 not to mention\ncompliant, secure, and perform well in China for global companies.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/covid-19-how-foreign-companies-leverage-it-solutions-china/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * \n\n* * *\n\n**About Us**\n\n_China Briefing is written and produced by[Dezan Shira &\nAssociates](https://www.dezshira.com/).

that simplified accounting\n\n# Technological innovations that simplified accounting\n\n  * \n\nwords Al Woods\n\n![accounting technology](http://www.fluxmagazine.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Account-Web-1.jpg)\n\nToday, with innovations constantly being reeled in, a great many sectors are\nexperiencing unprecedented ease with all aspects of their operations. This\ncould not be truer for the accounting sector, which has seen countless\ntechnological innovations simplify its one-time complicated operations.\n\nThese accounting innovations are indispensable for accountants across all\nfields. That said, **here are some innovative developments that have made\naccounting run more smoothly than ever before.**\n\n#### Optical Character Recognition\n\nAlthough it is possible to manage the finances of a client more efficiently\nwith integration, it is impossible to do the same for accounting productivity.\nThis is simply because you cannot reduce the manual entries, which are used to\nrecord the different financial transactions. However, with the help of\n[optical character recognition](https://www.lifewire.com/optical-character-\nrecognition-4158322) (OCR), accountants have found a way to simplify their\nwork tenfold. The technology allows accountants to automate many processes,\nthus, accelerate entries. Basically, OCR converts text to digital files via\nmobile device cameras and scanners.\n\n#### Accounting Software Integration\n\nAccounting is perhaps one of the most complicated and demanding jobs across\nall fields. Naturally, with such a status, using a myriad of tools is\nnecessitated. This can include software solutions for managing invoices,\nprocessing payments, tracking inventory, handling the payroll and managing\nfinancial reports. However, by integrating the different software, you will\nhave a singular powerhouse tool that can manage all at the same time.\nMoreover, an integrated software reduces errors across all operations and will\nhave everything run smoothly at a quicker pace.\n\nAdditionally, each accounting work is unique to a business\u2019s different\nsituations and circumstances. One accounting process that stands out with its\ncomplexity is payrolls. Seeing as how it can be difficult to run the same\nprogram for various businesses of different sizes, using an advanced payroll\nfeature can help. In fact, accounting specialists[ from\nZenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/payroll/) explain that additional features,\nlike multiple schedule pay rates, garnishments support, tips reporting,\ncontractor payments, and general ledger can help simplify your accounting\ntasks. Such a tool can work perfectly to serve your various purposes, while it\nintegrates with other software.\n\n#### Digital Currency\n\nDigital currencies are one of the most popular technological innovations that\ncan simplify accounting works. This is mostly due to how easy it has become to\nmake international payments through digital currency, which must then be\nrecorded by accounting firms. As opposed to the impossible difficulty previous\ntimes had presented, accountants can now utilize this tool to record a digital\ntransaction as if it was just a regular cash transaction. Moreover, this tool\nwill work through calculating the currency and reporting tax simultaneously,\nsaving accountants a lot of time.\n\n#### Cloud-Based Accounting\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the most innovative tools that have helped keep\naccountants updated and still relevant in today\u2019s markets. Reason goes to the\ntechnology\u2019s ability in giving accountants access to financial data at all-\ntimes and from any place. Additionally, they do more for simplifying\naccounting works, as they make collaborations between clients and accountants\npossible. Simply using a device with internet connectivity will grant them\naccess to the power and benefits of cloud-based accounting.\n\n#### Blockchain\n\nNot long ago, Blockchain technology was exclusively restricted to digital\ncurrency transactions. However, that is no longer the case. This technology\nhas allowed many businesses to digitally record their financial transactions\nin an open and secured ledger. These characteristics allow for the\n[transparency of financial\ntransactions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2017/11/09/transparent-\ntransactions-how-blockchain-payments-can-make-life-easier-\nfor-b2b-companies/#7960852070b5), but also make them auditable without time or\nlocation limitations. Furthermore, custom software application with Blockchain\ntechnology is sought-after by accountants due to its ability to accelerate\nfund transfer, accurately record transactions and reduce receivables and\npayables.\n\n#### Machine Learning\n\nAccounting innovations have bred the ability of machine learning in\naccounting, which saves a lot of time and effort in many accounting works. The\nmachine starts by learning patterns and analyzing large amounts of data. In a\npragmatic sense, it would analyze large amounts of data to recognize relevant\ninformation and point them out. Typically, accountants use this simplifying\ntool to automate validation and categorization tasks.\n\nAll in all, these technological innovations help simplify various accounting\nworks that have made the lives of accounting firms easier and less expensive.\nIn addition to lowering expenses, accounting firms also benefit from their\nability to increase productivity, which can help increase profits over time.\nNot to mention, these technologies grant better accuracy and make many parts\nof the accounting processes seamless. However, for these technological\ninnovations to work efficiently, accountants will need to handpick the\nsoftware they choose to employ, as it can produce different outcomes. Ideally,\nsoftware with advanced features will work best.\n\nTags:\n\n  * [accountants](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/tag/accountants/)\n  * [business technology](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/tag/business-technology/)\n  * [online business](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/tag/online-business/)\n  * [technology article](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/tag/technology-article/)\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/)\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/)\n  * [ __ Pinterest ](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?url=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/&media=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Account-Web-1.jpg)\n  * __\n    * [Google +](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/)\n    * [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/)\n    * [Email](mailto:?Subject=&Body=Technological innovations that simplified accounting https://www.fluxmagazine.com/technological-innovations-simplified-accounting/)\n  * ### 0\n\nShares\n\n[ ![investing gold](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Gold-Web-3-680x120.jpg)![investing\ngold](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gold-\nWeb-3-680x120.jpg) PREV STORY\n\n##### Unconventional ways to invest in gold\n\n](https://www.fluxmagazine.com/unconventional-invest-in-gold/)\n\n#### Intrepid fashion, music, art, film, technology & culture magazine.

A [survey of 251 UK HR and payroll\nmanagers](https://www.businessleader.co.uk/uks-largest-employers-often-pay-\nstaff-incorrectly-or-late/66153/) in private-sector companies with more than\n1,000 staff, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of HR and payroll software and\nservices supplier MHR, reveals that 52% are still using spreadsheets as part\nof their payroll process, while just over one-third rely on paper-based\ntimesheets. The reason given for this by over half of respondents was that\n\u201cthings have always been done this way\u201d.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the manual nature of at least some of their\nprocesses, 76% of organisations also admitted they have failed to pay\nemployees correctly or on time an average of four times over the past 12\nmonths.\n\nThe issue, says Pete Tiliakos, principal analyst for HR and technology\nservices at analyst firm NelsonHall, is that traditionally, companies have\ntreated payroll as a cost centre, which means many functions have \u201climped\nalong with cobbled-together solutions, disparate and outdated, albeit\nreliable, platforms and a lack of global reporting capability\u201d.\n\nBut as more and more businesses invest in [HR transformation\ninitiatives](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Getting-to-the-\npayoff-of-digital-transformation-in-HR), payroll is starting to be pulled\nalong too. \u201cOrganisations are realising that payroll is a big factor in HR\ntransformation,\u201d says Tiliakos. \u201cAlthough the focus has to date been on\nsourcing, developing and retaining talent, if you don\u2019t pay them on time and\naccurately, all that doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 so payroll is very important and has to\nbe included in the vision.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly true in the face of growing numbers of [gig workers in\nthe\neconomy](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252439029/Contingent-\nworkers-challenge-human-capital-management-strategies), who increasingly\nadvocate on-demand pay models that traditional payroll systems are not set up\nto deal with.\n\nOther drivers for change include compliance and the rising complexity of\nglobal regulations. The problem here is that enabling reliable, globally\nconsolidated payroll reporting is a big challenge when using decentralised,\npoorly integrated systems that are often different in each country, which\ntends to lead to the manual collation of reports.\n\n### __A market in transition\n\nAs a result, a common pattern for transformation initiatives is to start with\nHR and then move on to\n[payroll](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/payroll-software)\nabout 12 months after either initial discussions or the transition itself,\nalthough this is not always the case. For example, international expansion or\nmerger and acquisition activity sometimes forces the hand of employers to\ntackle payroll first.\n\nMelanie Robinson, senior HR director for sales and marketing at payroll\nservices giant ADP, says: \u201cPayroll is a market in transition, but the common\nthread is streamlining and simplifying manual processes. Whether we are\nlooking at single country or global payroll, it\u2019s about leveraging technology\nto cut costs, increase efficiency and improve the user experience.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean everything will be plain sailing. Common barriers to\nchange include an inability to make a positive business case that demonstrates\na sufficient return on investment, particularly if payroll is simply seen as a\ncost centre.\n\n#### Read more about HR software\n\n  * Allocating work by algorithm might have advantages for workers as well as employers.

Tiliakos says this is linked to the fact that \u201cmany organisations lack\nthe skills and capability to successfully manage change in-house for a large-\nscale transformation programme\u201d.\n\nA global lack of in-house payroll skills is also having an impact and, as a\nresult, is leading some organisations to go down the outsourcing route.\n\nNonetheless, Tiliakos believes the future looks bright for payroll. \u201cIt\u2019s an\ninteresting time in that technology, such as cloud and [robotic process\nautomation](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/robotic-\nprocess-automation), is starting to make an impact and organisations are\nseeing it and wanting to modernise their solutions and leverage some of that,\u201d\nhe says.\n\nA key consideration here is that payroll data, which is among the richest,\nmost accurate but also most underused data in the business, has traditionally\nbeen difficult to get at and analyse. But as companies [update and integrate\ntheir systems](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-choose-a-\npayroll-vendor-8-keys-for-SMBs), it leads to \u201cmassive possibilities\u201d, says\nTiliakos.\n\n\u201cThe payroll professionals of the future will undertake a lot more analytics\nactivity and work with bots to ensure they are performing and interpreting\nwhat the trends are to create more optimisation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge\nopportunity for payroll to become more of a strategic partner for the\nbusiness, so in future it will be much less about manual processes and heavy-\nlifting and much more about value-add.\u201d\n\n#### Case study: The Castle Hotel, Taunton\n\nThe Castle Hotel has been able to boost the efficiency of its labour planning\nactivities by integrating rostering and electronic point of sale (epos)\nsoftware with its payroll system.\n\nLast year, the hotel, located in Taunton and employing about 100 people,\nreplaced a standalone electronic till with cloud-based epos applications from\nTalech.\n\nThe software was also integrated with Deputy\u2019s cloud-based staff rota and time\nclock packages, which replaced a previously manual system and enabled managers\nto optimise staff rotas based on current requirements.\n\nEmployees can use their smartphones to clock in and out and schedule time\naway, such as holidays.\n\nJon Peilow, the hotel\u2019s financial director, says: \u201cEffectively, in the past,\nnothing joined up and we had to calculate everything manually using\nspreadsheets. But the process has now become much more seamless and has saved\nus a lot of admin time.\u201d\n\nFor example, the time it takes to process payroll has been cut by half a day a\nmonth because it is no longer necessary to manually key in how many hours each\nemployee has worked. Using a CSV file, the information is now uploaded\ndirectly to the Castle\u2019s BrightPay cloud-based payroll system, which also\nreduces the likelihood of manual errors.\n\nThe new system, which replaced older Sage applications about six months ago,\nalso enables employees to access all their payroll data via a dedicated\nportal.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel\u2019s six department heads are saving up to three hours a\nweek on putting together schedules and signing off timesheets. They also have\naccess to real-time reports on costs as a percentage of sales revenue and can\nsee how much is being spent on labour.\n\n\u201cUltimately, [staff are the biggest cost in hospitality\nbusinesses](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450432644/Oxford-and-\nCambridge-Club-shelves-ledgers-for-time-and-attendance) and, while that\u2019s\ngoing up between 5% and 6% a year, it\u2019s difficult to increase charges\naccordingly, due to current market conditions,\u201d says Peilow. \u201cSo we need to\nget smarter about labour planning by becoming more efficient \u2013 and that means\nsharing data with department heads on a real-time basis.\u201d\n\nWhereas in the past, such information was shared monthly, the integrated\nsystem means it can now be viewed daily at the touch of a button, to optimise\nhow employees are deployed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much more cost-effective approach and gives us what we need,\u201d says\nPeilow. \u201cAlthough we could undertake labour cost analysis before, it was very\nmanual and labour-intensive and so was always at the bottom of the pile. But\nnow we can treat it as a priority because that\u2019s where it is possible to make\nthe most efficiencies.\u201d\n\n#### Case study: Severn Trent Water\n\n[Severn Trent](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500246271/CIO-interview-\nMyron-Hrycyk-CIO-Severn-Trent-Water) Water\u2019s HR and payroll transformation\nproject is now starting to free up enough time to enable staff to analyse\npayroll data and use the insights gleaned to boost the wider employee\nexperience.\n\nThe utilities provider started its \u201ctransformational journey\u201d about a year\nago, which has resulted in it revisiting its policies, processes and\nprocedures \u201cto de-clutter them and remove the bureaucracy\u201d, says Joe Carter,\nthe firm\u2019s HR manager.\n\nA key objective was to ensure that such processes became more \u201cseamless and\nautomated\u201d to make it quicker and easier for the company\u2019s 6,500 staff and\nmanagers to undertake HR-related tasks, he says.\n\nA second goal was to reduce risk and improve the accuracy of payroll\nprocessing, and another was to free up Severn Trent\u2019s payroll team to perform\n\u201cmore meaningful activity that directly supports the business, and ensure\nthere is a human face rather than just a faceless HR function\u201d, says Carter.\n\nUltimately, though, the aim is to \u201cdeliver the best employee experience we\ncan\u201d, he says, and a big part of that is about ensuring people are paid\naccurately and on time each month.\n\n\u201cPayroll is something that people just expect to work and they don\u2019t\nnecessarily see what goes on behind the scenes, but they soon let you know if\nsomething goes wrong,\u201d says Carter. \u201cSo by increasing reliability, you can\nensure employees get a good experience and can focus on the job they\u2019re paid\nto do.\u201d\n\nTight integration between Severn Trent\u2019s long-term outsourcing supplier MHR\u2019s\ncloud-based iTrent payroll system and the utility firm\u2019s in-house SAP HR\napplications, plus the fact that the \u201cmajority of the payroll side of things\nis now automated\u201d, means that for the last six months or so, it has no longer\nbeen necessary for the three members of the in-house payroll team to key in\nany information manually, says Carter.\n\nInstead, they can now spend more of their time analysing payroll data in order\nto understand costs better, identify trends and potentially introduce business\nchange.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about freeing up time for the team to do more advanced analytics during\nthe payroll run, so they can see if things don\u2019t look right,\u201d says Carter .\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also about spotting business trends, so if there\u2019s a spike in\nsickness or overtime claims, we can engage with the business, query what is\ncausing the change and see if an intervention is necessary, such as providing\nmore resources.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still early days here, the aim over time is to focus more and\nmore on gaining strategic value from the careful analysis of payroll data.\nUsing data in this way isn\u2019t just about ensuring people are paid accurately\nand on time; it\u2019s about exploring what the data is telling us and how we can\nus it to improve productivity and the employee experience.\u201d\n\n####  __Read more on HR software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How real-time analytics can benefit HR\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/feffer_mark.jpg) By: Mark\nFeffer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-real-time-analytics-\ncan-benefit-HR)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 5 of the latest trends in payroll management HR should know\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/jones_katherine_02.jpg) By:\nKatherine Jones ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/5-of-the-latest-\ntrends-in-payroll-management-HR-should-know)\n\n  * [\n\n##### HRIS (human resource information system)\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/HRIS)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement best practices still rely on the human touch\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/feffer_mark.jpg) By: Mark\nFeffer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nbest-practices-still-rely-on-the-human-touch)\n\n__Latest News\n\n  * [What next for subpostmasters\u2019 miscarriage of justice appeals?](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481338/What-next-for-subpostmasters-miscarriage-of-justice-appeals)\n  * [Coronavirus threats ramp up as more hospitals come under attack](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481298/Coronavirus-threats-ramp-up-as-more-hospitals-come-under-attack)\n  * [Samsung, AWS claim world\u2019s first mission-critical comms video call](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481309/Samsung-AWS-claim-worlds-first-mission-critical-comms-video-call)\n  * [View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n__Download CW Asia-Pacific\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/APAC-0320-cover-252px.jpg)](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-Pacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre) In The Current Issue:\n    * Inside the security operations centre: The nerve centre of security operations\n    * Defining and evaluating SOC as a service\n[ Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-\nPacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre)\n\n__Latest Blog Posts\n\n  * [Combatting Covid Fraud: both doorstep and on-line: clarifying the sources of guidance](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/When-IT-Meets-Politics/Combatting-Covid-Fraud-both-doorstep-and-on-line-clarifying-the-sources-of-guidance) - When IT Meets Politics\n  * [IT modernisation series \u2013 Riverbed: Don\u2019t leave ops in the dark](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/IT-modernisation-series-Riverbed-Dont-leave-ops-in-the-dark) - CW Developer Network\n  * [View All Blogs](https://www.computerweekly.com/blogs)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [How real-time analytics can benefit HR](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-real-time-analytics-can-benefit-HR) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Employee engagement best practices still rely on the ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-best-practices-still-rely-on-the-human-touch) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Key HRIS implementation strategies for small business](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/HRMS-implementation-strategies-for-small-business) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Start the conversation\n\n###  __ 0 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/automated-\nretail/2020/the-helpful-robots-of-automated-retail/) __\n\nHigh-level market intelligence about the[$18\nbillion](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/retail-automation-market-\nsize-emerging-technologies-business-strategy-industrial-insights-growth-\nfuture-trends-segmentation-sales-revenue-and-regional-\nforecast-2023-2019-11-04) expected to be invested over the next three years is\na major focus of the [March 2020 Automated Retail\nTracker\u2122](https://www.pymnts.com/automated-retail/2020/cloud-based-inventory-\nmanagement-smart-vending/) from [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/), which\nserves as a bimonthly breakdown of developments in this rapidly growing\nbusiness sector.\n\nCompanies are earmarking billions to create unattended retail (UR) experiences\nthat optimize the combination of consumer products, connected commerce and\nphysical space. It seems like yesterday that people were fumbling with self-\ncheckout scanners in supermarkets. Now retail has the inverse issue: demand is\noutstripping supply for self-serve options and UR experiences.\n\n\u201cAmericans are growing more comfortable shopping for food or electronics\nwithout the aid of another human,\u201d the report states, continuing that, \u201ca\nrecent report by PYMNTS [shows] that the supply of cashier-less channels such\nas vending machines, self-service kiosks and even fully automated retail\nstores, lag significantly behind demand. PYMNTS\u2019 recent \u201cThe Future Of\nUnattended Retail Report: Vending As The New Contextual Commerce\u201d showed that\n48.7 percent of consumers would like to use unattended retail channels,\nincluding fully automated retail locations, to shop for anything from\nelectronics to cosmetics.\u201d\n\nThe incredible story of innovation now going on in self-service and UR is\nthoroughly documented in the [March 2020 Automated Retail\nTracker\u2122](https://www.pymnts.com/automated-retail/2020/cloud-based-inventory-\nmanagement-smart-vending/) from [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/).\n\n **\u2018Amazon Go\u2019 Cashless**\n\nCall it trend or phenomenon, cashierless operations are popping up back by\ninfluential money. As we read in the [March 2020 Automated Retail\nTracker\u2122](https://www.pymnts.com/automated-retail/2020/cloud-based-inventory-\nmanagement-smart-vending/), \u201ceCommerce giant Amazon is among the companies\ntapping into unattended operations to keep time-strapped customers satisfied.\nIt opened its first cashierless Amazon Go convenience shop in 2016 and is now\nupgrading the model, launching its first full, brick-and-mortar grocery store\nin Seattle, Washington\u2019s Capitol Hill District. Shoppers will not have to\nworry about checkout lines at counters when visiting the Go Grocery stores,\nbut will have access to a wider variety of products than can be found at\nregular Go stores \u2014 including those from Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods unit and lower-\npriced items like Kellogg\u2019s cereal.\u201d\n\nWe also read about experiments by convenience store titan 7-Eleven, which has\nrolled out a string of cashierless locations near its Texas home base. The\nC-store giant is using the payment app Scan & Pay for the Texas tests, and\nit\u2019s been experimenting it has had mobile payments on a development fast-track\nfor the past year at least. And Amazon and 7-Eleven aren\u2019t alone.\n\nOut-of-stock situations are one of the hobgoblins of unattended retail, and\nthe [March 2020 Automated Retail Tracker\u2122](https://www.pymnts.com/automated-\nretail/2020/cloud-based-inventory-management-smart-vending/) details pilots of\nsystems such as SmartSight from Illinois-based Zebra Technologies. It is an \u201c\u2026\nintelligent automation solution to help merchants better manage inventory and\nto reduce labor time and cost,\u201d the report says. \u201cIts solution employs\ntechnologies such as computer vision, machine learning (ML) and workflow\nautomation to identify out-of-stock items, prisoning inconsistencies and\nplanogram. Problems are relayed to the staff for correction. Reducing out-of-\nstock incidences significantly and minimizing price mislabeling has enhanced\ncustomer loyalty and increased average basket sizes, the company said.\u201d\n\n **UR Making Me Laugh**\n\nCreativity rules in UR at the moment as retailers, consumer brands, tech firms\nand an assortment of players with skin in the retail game roll out new\napplications as quickly as they can be imagined. Ironically, it\u2019s a time of\ncommunity excitement and collaboration and even new levels of consumer\nengagement in an industry conceived around isolated machines.\n\nNow, it\u2019s downright fun.\n\n\u201cFunko, maker of collectible tiny figurines, is combing functionality and fun\ninto its interactive touchscreen [kiosks],\u201d the report states. \u201cThe company\nhas a patent out on a vending machine that dispenses character toys called\nSnapsies. The diverse lineup of characters includes rock star unicorn Jeff and\nsuper athlete mountain goat Bille, and kids can fix them up in different\noutfits. Along with different ways to model their characters, the kids can\nalso watch a video created by Funko Animation Studios. The machine dispenses a\ntoy capsule for the kids to unwrap and play with. The machines are expected in\nretail stores this fall at Target.\u201d\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group. In the **April 2020 B2B API\nTracker** , Latiff explains how banks can provide a timely assist via\napplication programming interfaces (APIs) that integrate payments into those\neCommerce platforms.\n\n![](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-banking.jpg)\n\n](https://www.pymnts.com/linkout/558671)\n\nRelated Items:[7-Eleven](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/7-eleven/), [amazon\ngo](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/amazon-go/), [automated retail\ntracker](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/automated-retail-tracker/),\n[News](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/news/),\n[Retail](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/retail/), [Unattended\nRetail](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/unattended-retail/)\n\n__Share __Tweet [__Share](sms://&body=The Helpful Robots Of Automated Retail\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/automated-retail/2020/the-helpful-robots-of-automated-\nretail/) __Share __Share __Print [__Email](mailto:?subject=The Helpful Robots\nOf Automated Retail&BODY=I found this article interesting and thought of\nsharing it with you.

Corporates and government officials have\nrecently been sounding the alarm about coronavirus-related scams,\nand[according to experts](https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/companies-\nunited-states-government-warn-coronavirus-cyber-scams/), the threat is likely\nto rise.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment that a lot of hackers across the world have been preparing\nfor,\u201d said Brian Finch, partner at Pillsbury law firm and co-leader of the\ncompany\u2019s coronavirus response team, in are recent Compliance Week report.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to conduct pretty robust cyber-espionage, if not\ncyber-hostage taking. We are already seeing a spike in cyberattacks, including\non remote connection services.\u201d\n\nOfficials are warning of a rise in phishing attacks, while\n[retailers](https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2020/online-\nretailers-scramble-fight-coronavirus-scams/) have also been warned about fraud\nrisks, with Amazon recently removing 1 million products for allegedly making\nfraudulent claims, recent\n[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedknutson/2020/03/04/marketplace-\ncontagion-amazon-has-already-removed-a-million-fake-products-related-to-\ncoronavirus/#6d060979418c) reports said.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell how the coronavirus crisis will impact corporates\u2019\nfinancial and payment operations, but while analysts continue to [raise the\nalert](https://www.cnbc.com/select/prevent-business-credit-card-fraud-during-\ncoronavirus/) about consumer payments fraud, the risk of B2B payments fraud\npersists, particularly as more employees work from home.\n\n\u201cAnother side effect of the Coronavirus is increased teleworking, which\nfurthers the reliance on email for communication adding yet another multiplier\nto these email fraud schemes,\u201d the U.S. Secret Service Department of Homeland\nSecurity wrote in a\n[warning](https://www.secretservice.gov/data/press/releases/2020/20-MAR/Secret_Service_Coronavirus_Phishing_Alert.pdf)\npublished earlier this month.\n\nBelow, PYMNTS looks at some of the latest data points around the fraud threat.\n\n **Six years of alleged fraud saw one payroll firm accused of stealing\nmillions of dollars** , according to [The Philadelphia\nInquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/news/payroll-processor-fraud-myles-\nhannigan-irs-tax-collections-pennsylvania-20200311.html). Payroll\nProfessionals Inc. has been accused by federal prosecutors of \u201cone of the most\nextreme abuses of trust,\u201d allegedly stealing from small businesses, corporates\nand nonprofits between 2009 and 2015 in the Philadelphia area. Reports said\nbusiness users of the payroll software had funds taken out for tax purposes,\nbut the IRS insists these firms have millions of dollars in unpaid tax bills\nand penalties. Payroll Professionals Inc owner Myles Hannigan is serving a\nfour-year sentence after pleading guilty to tax fraud, reports noted.\n\n **37 percent of finance professionals say their firms foster an environment\nfor fraud** , a new survey from Compleat Software has\n[revealed](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/businesses-fostering-environment-\nfraud-37-finance-workers-strongly-believe-so/article/1674724). The report\nsurveyed U.K. finance professionals that have revealed doubts over whether\ntheir organizations are positioning themselves to be more at risk for fraud:\n20 percent of respondents agreed their payment and procurement processes place\ntheir companies at risk for fraud.\n\n **$20.42 million in estimated refunds were paid by U.K. bank TSB to fraud\nvictims** , recent [Financial\nTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/5d16d6b4-36e6-4c0c-bdcf-a292f143b556)\nreports said, with the figure emerging after TSB\u2019s first year of committing to\nreimburse victims of bank payments fraud via its \u201cfraud refund guarantee\u201d\nprogram. The financial institution (FI) vowed last April to refund all victims\nof authorized push payment fraud, which often occurs after individuals are\ntricked via calls, texts and emails posing as legitimate bank staff. It\u2019s\nunclear whether small businesses are eligible for the reimbursement program,\nthough the scam is commonly found targeting small and medium-sized businesses\n(SMBs) and corporates via business email compromise schemes and other\nfraudulent tactics.\n\n **$2.1 billion in losses were reported to the FBI as a result of hackers\ntargeting Microsoft Office 365 and Google G suite** in a slew of business\nemail compromise attacks, [Bleeping\nComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warns-of-bec-\nattacks-abusing-microsoft-office-365-google-g-suite/) reported earlier this\nmonth. The attacks that target workforce platforms reflects fraudsters' shift\nto cloud email services as businesses themselves migrate away from on-premise\nemail systems, the publication noted, with the FBI warning that fraudsters are\ninfiltrating these email portals to better mimic legitimate employees to\nconduct their scams.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group. In the **April 2020 B2B API\nTracker** , Latiff explains how banks can provide a timely assist via\napplication programming interfaces (APIs) that integrate payments into those\neCommerce platforms.\n\n![](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-banking.jpg)\n\n](https://www.pymnts.com/linkout/558671)\n\nRelated Items:[B2B](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/b2b/), [B2B Data\nDigest](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/b2b-data-digest/), [B2B\nfraud](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/b2b-fraud/), [B2B\nPayments](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/b2b-payments/), [Business Email\nCompromise](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/business-email-compromise/),\n[Coronavirus](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/coronavirus/), [Editors'\nPicks](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/editors-picks/), [email\nfraud](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/email-fraud/),\n[News](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/news/), [payments\nfraud](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/payments-fraud/),\n[payroll](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/payroll-2/),\n[phishing](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/phishing/), [work from\nhome](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/work-from-home/)\n\n__Share __Tweet [__Share](sms://&body=Email Fraudsters Take Advantage Of\nCoronavirus Opportunity https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/email-\nfraud-coronavirus-data-digest/) __Share __Share __Print\n[__Email](mailto:?subject=Email Fraudsters Take Advantage Of Coronavirus\nOpportunity&BODY=I found this article interesting and thought of sharing it\nwith you.

all the madness going on at the moment, it was only a matter of time\nbefore fintechs stepped up.\n\n![Here are the side projects fintechs are launching to ease strain of\ncoronavirus](/images/featured/here-are-the-side-projects-fintechs-are-\nlaunching-to-ease-strain-of-coronavirus.jpg)\n\nImage source: Jamie Campbell/Twitter  \n\nIt's no secret that the world has been flipped on its head as governments\nacross the globe try to get to grips with the worsening coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAnd while chaos ensues around the world, _AltFi_ took a look around to see\nwhat new coronavirus-related initiatives the world of fintech is offering.\n\n#### New services\n\n**Covid Credit**\n\nPossibly the most notable fintech contribution to help correct some of the\ndisruption caused by coronavirus is the [Covid\nCredit](https://covidcredit.uk/) calculator.\n\nCovid Credit is a platform created by a collaboration between Fronted, [11:FS\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/11fs)and Credit Kudos to help self-employed\nworkers prove a loss of income needed to claim new government benefits.\n\nOn its website, the platform is described as \"a proof of concept to\ndemonstrate how open banking data could support freelancers in the COVID-19\neconomic crisis.\"\n\n**Coronavirus Furlough Calculator**\n\nSimilarly, Pento, an automated payroll platform, has launched a [Coronavirus\nFurlough Calculator](https://www.pento.io/uk-furlough-coronavirus-job-\nretention-calculator).\n\n**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zS5PEAhdNveR6Y_y6RIodMGijnOoZscoOMu471F7d7aEJAQTpEjaQgRNivFUNNwnzqP5oxomZfyr_C44YPqqTwQXgRr4i7Ja7gXuJJump3exOAbAF6bi3G3D9_HMuMGteTNEgZ0b)**\n\nThe platform was launched to help businesses work out the amount they can\nclaim from the Government to cover the costs of furloughing employees.\n\nIn another attempt to ease the strain on SMEs during the coronavirus outbreak,\nPento has also announced that its payroll system will be free for three\nmonths.\n\n**COVID-19 Relief and Wellbeing Network**\n\nTully, a financial management app, has launched the [COVID-19 Relief and\nWellbeing Network](https://www.tully.co.uk/how-we-help) to help reach those\naffected by the ongoing pandemic.\n\nThe company estimates that \"17m people in the UK have been financially\nimpacted by the Coronavirus crisis,\" and it hopes to help those people access\nthe relief they need.\n\nTully hopes to provide those in need with regular support and updates as soon\nas new information is released and if it is needed, Tully can communicate with\nits network partners to help organise payment relief.\n\n**Save My Local**\n\n[Save My Local ](https://savemylocal.org/)is a free initiative spearheaded by\na group of small business leaders to help protect local businesses who are\nmost at risk of folding because of current economic disruption caused by the\ncoronavirus.\n\n**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zK8iPUh6_2qxUe_wlXXiJ6yBqtFWj6qAmkg0B0lnbd0qosDiz6bZftfTPdCNzhF-\nYL6-VUKObuoMcw3CEaIqpn4QD-x_WVWh5gsruQwX73Uolu9EfYdJY3DewhrJh1AKBwX8fNIr)**\n\nThe platform helps small vendors sell vouchers to customers to keep local\nbusinesses afloat.\n\nSave My Local promises to help small businesses reach a wider audience by\npromoting them on social media and through email campaigns.\n\n**Money Dashboard**\n\nMoney Dashboard, a personal finance assistant, has created a new [community\nforum](https://community.moneydashboard.com/about) to help people curb their\nunnecessary spending.\n\nThe platform uses industry experts and trusted sources to provide advice on\nhow to stay on top of finances during this period of economic turmoil.\n\n**Campaign for Self-Employed Income Support**\n\n[Coconut,](http://www.altfi.com/companies/coconut) the banking platform\ndesigned for SMEs and freelancers, has launched a [free-to-use web\ntool](https://selfemployedincomesupport.co.uk/home/) to increase the number of\nbusinesses eligible for government support.\n\nThe fintech has said it will lobby the Government \"to encourage them to allow\nself-employed people to submit their 2019/20 Self-Assessment,\" the current\nreparations are based on 2019/20 tax returns.\n\nSMEs and freelancers just need to sign up with an email to use the tool and to\nhear the latest updates on the campaign.\n\n**WageStream**\n\nWageStream, an online wage-tracking service for employers and employees, has\nreleased a number of \"[alleviation\nsolutions](https://wagestream.co.uk/covid-19-landing/)\" to help businesses\ncope with the coronavirus disruption.\n\n**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xggMLOZINPIinu-1FY5EVUdkTQutelmLk7b-cTjbnOX2QfmCQ1jnkJA1GNAbnfqVx95-h6RJP-P7j736CEyE_Fach8Caaxric-\nEmdtOUQS0wH3GkOV79gqdtmhjXFyETCXtePArX)**\n\nThe platform has launched a 'company contingency communications' channel to\nhelp firms send push notifications to help keep staff updated in real-time.\n\nAlongside this, WageStream has introduced several payment support provisions\nincluding an automated statutory sick payment process, the immediate payment\nof overtime and furloughed staff payment support whereby furloughed employees\ncan access 50 per cent of their income through WageStream.\n\n#### Concessions and freebies\n\n**Starling**\n\nDigital challenger bank[ Starling ](http://www.altfi.com/companies/starling-\nbank)announced last week that it had introduced a[ Coronavirus Support\nScheme](https://www.altfi.com/article/6379_starling-introduces-coronavirus-\nsupport-scheme-to-help-struggling-customers) for its customers affected by the\nongoing crisis.\n\nCustomers must be able to prove they have lost income due to the coronavirus\nbut, if accepted, they will receive a three-month interest holiday on their\noverdrafts.\n\nUnder the scheme, the bank has said that all interest charged on overdrafts\nwill be waived and it will not be collecting any accumulated interest at the\nend of the three months.\n\n**Wollit**\n\nIncome smoother Wollit announced last week that it was [fast-tracking the\nlaunch of its first product](https://www.altfi.com/article/6367_london-based-\nfintech-brings-forward-launch-of-income-levelling-product-to-help-freelancers-\nand-gig-workers-hit-by-coronavirus) to help freelancers hit by the\ncoronavirus.\n\nThe Wollit Income Promise was due to launch later this year but has been\nbrought forward to May to help those in need.\n\n**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBD70dCfiqnE16YFwtDwTW9Lq_o_F2pexS_xjiDZcBo6L2LOsAr8C3UZxbY9bbG1jhUrER0HLO7BASPJ9nY3JRU8tOt7mgJarupKilkdOq5WtshY3d0puPvQP9GxkNEgjPhvBkkU)**\n\nWollit hopes to regulate the income of those not in full-time work and\nprovides customers with an interest-free cash top-up whenever they earn less\nthan their average monthly earnings.\n\n**SumUp**\n\nSME-favourite SumUp announced last month that it is [waiving fees for mobile\npayments and invoicing](https://www.altfi.com/article/6358_sumup-scraps-fees-\nacross-europe-to-help-tackle-spread-of-coronavirus) across Europe to enable\nusers to process payments remotely.\n\nThe provider of card readers to 2m small businesses revealed it hoped this\nconcession would help tackle the spread of coronavirus by allowing merchants\nto process payments by sharing a link via email, WhatsApp, SMS or any other\nmessaging platform.\n\n**NatWest and Mettle**\n\nNatWest has announced a partnership between its digital business bank [Mettle\n](http://www.altfi.com/companies/mettle)and cloud-based accountancy platform\nFree Agent.\n\nThe partnership will see SMEs save up to \u00a3150, or the minimum cost of an\nannual subscription to Free Agent.\n\nThe partnership is the most recent concession NatWest has given to smaller\nbusinesses during the coronavirus outbreak, just under a month ago the bank\n[pledged \u00a35bn to SMEs for coronavirus\nsupport](https://www.altfi.com/article/6285_natwest-pledges-5bn-to-smes-for-\ncoronavirus-support).\n\n* * *\n\nThink we've missed an important coronavirus-related project?

What's worse, is there is an ever-present risk that\nsmall errors here can lead to big (and even more time-consuming) disputes and\nissues later down the track.\n\nThat's why specialised software can be such an important tool for HR\nprofessionals of all levels. Taking that difficult and risk-heavy task out of\nthe in-tray through an automated system gives HR leaders much greater\nopportunity to concentrate on building effective and productive cultures\nacross their workforce.

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/mixing-\npayment-rail-eases-card-bank-transfer/) __\n\nNo one payment rail can solve every point of friction in B2B payments.\n\nInstead, new research suggests embracing multiple rails can drive revenue.\nThis week's look at payment rail innovation explores how corporates and\nFinTech providers embrace variety to ease friction in card acceptance,\nemployee payroll and invoice payments.\n\n **Payroll Rails Offer Employee Relief**\n\nWhile paper checks have been the go-to tool to facilitate payroll payouts,\norganizations that are shifting away from the paycheck \u2014 and even direct\ndeposit \u2014 are finding that new payment rails are enabling them to extend\nsupport to struggling employees.\n\nReports in [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/companies-offer-cash-\nstrapped-employees-daily-pay-cards-as-a-lifeline.html) said businesses' use of\npayroll cards, PayPal and other electronic payment methods is on the rise as\nemployers explore ways to more quickly connect workers to cash. Adoption of\none early wage access tool, DailyPay, has risen 400 percent in just three\ndays, reports said, with professionals demanding more flexible payroll options\nfrom their employers \u2014 with potential long-term ramifications after the\ncoronavirus pandemic crisis eases.\n\n **Ripple Targets SCB 's Corporate Customers**\n\nThailand-based [Siam Commercial\nBank](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35532/scb-brings-ripple-powered-\ncross-border-payments-to-biz-customers) (SCB) announced an expansion of its\npartnership with blockchain technology firm Ripple to expand its cross-border\npayment capabilities for business customers. In a press release, Ripple said\nit will enable SCB to expand its existing Ripple-powered mobile app, which\nfacilitates global payments for consumers, to its corporate users in an effort\nto connect small businesses to real-time, cross-border payment capabilities.\n\nAlthough the solution was initially designed for migrant workers to move money\nabroad more easily, the mobile app, which uses a QR code to facilitate global\npayments, could address global payments friction in a B2B context as well, the\ncompanies said.\n\n **Mixing Payment Rails Drives SMB Revenue**\n\nNo single payment rail can solve all B2B payment problems, and new research\nfrom business solution provider [Weave](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-\nsmall-businesses-offering-multiple-130000601.html) suggests that small- to\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs) embracing a mix of payment rails are better\noff. In a new survey released this week, Weave found that SMBs that offer a\nvariety of payment methods on their invoices are able to increase revenue.\n\nAccording to the data, mixing payment rails can promote customer satisfaction,\nwith more than one-third of SMB customers interested in paying via text \u2014 yet\nonly 4 percent of SMBs said they offer this option. Further, only 16 percent\nof survey respondents said they offer more than three payment method options.\nFor the companies that accept at least four different payment methods, their\nannual revenues are up to seven-times as high as those SMBs that accept fewer\nthan four payment options, Weave found.\n\n **GrainChain Unites Banks And Blockchain**\n\nWhile blockchain as a payment rail is often wielded in an effort to bypass the\ntraditional banking system, B2B payments and trade finance solution provider\n[GrainChain](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/grainchain-\nblockchain-farming-cash-flow-risk), which targets the farming sector, is using\nSymbiont's Assembly blockchain to incorporate financial institutions within\nits blockchain solution. In a recent interview with PYMNTS, GrainChain Founder\nand CEO Luis Macias said blockchain promotes the security and privacy\ntraditional banks demand from any solution, while smart contract technology\nmitigates risk and promotes trust in B2B payment and trade finance\ntransactions.\n\n **Plastiq Eases Card Rail Friction**\n\nIn B2B payments, commercial cards are typically considered more beneficial to\nthe buyer than to the supplier, with card acceptance a critical barrier to\ncorporate card adoption. B2B FinTech\n[Plastiq](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plastiq-raises-75-million-\nseries-120010828.html) offers a solution aimed at enabling businesses to make\npayments via card, while enabling vendors to accept payment in a more\npreferable method.\n\nThe company has secured $75 million in venture capital funding for its\nsolution, with the Series D investment led by B Capital Group, according to a\npress release. The company said it will continue to expand its SMB customer\nbase and support SMBs' access to capital via card products.\n\n **U.S. Faster Payments Council Names New Leadership**\n\nThe [U.S. Faster Payments\nCouncil](https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2020/faster-payments-council-taps-\nwalmart-exec-as-new-executive-director/) has named [Reed\nLuhtanen](https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/512879107/u-s-faster-payments-\ncouncil-names-walmart-executive-reed-luhtanen-as-its-new-executive-director)\nas its new executive director. He joins the council after serving on the\nFederal Reserve's Governance Framework Formation Team, which created the\nFaster Payments Council, as well as working for the Corporate Advisory Group\nfor the Clearing House's Real-Time Payments System.\n\n\"I'm excited about the opportunity to lead the FPC and further its commitment\nto advancing the path to a faster payments future in the United States,\" he\nsaid in a statement.\n\n **Crypto.com Enables Crypto Invoice Payments**\n\nCryptocurrency platform [Crypto.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-\ncom-pay-launches-invoicing-141000238.html) wants to make it easier for\nbusinesses to get paid in cryptocurrency and has launched a new solution that\nallows businesses to receive crypto when issuing invoices. Crypto.com Pay\nallows sellers to generate crypto-friendly invoices that allow customers to\nsettle with a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. For the seller,\nthe payment is then converted to fiat currency based on a fixed exchange rate.\n\n **TrueLayer, ANNA Money Embrace Payments Initiation**\n\nAlthough bank transfers are a staple for many payment scenarios \u2014 B2B payments\nincluded \u2014 the payment method isn't without its challenges. Among the most\nfriction-filled is the need for payers to manually input their bank account\ninformation into a form, while sellers have to manually retrieve that data and\nre-key it into their own systems, opening up risk to errors and security\nbreaches.\n\nIn the U.K., open banking regulations have created Payments Initiation\ncapabilities, a feature that FinTech [ANNA\nMoney](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/anna-money-collabs-\ninstant-qr-code-smb-payments/) and API facilitator TrueLayer recently\nannounced they would wield for B2B payments.

What are the\nadvantages of full-service payroll?What are the disadvantages of full-service\npayroll?How do you choose between cheaper and full-service payroll?\n\nSee our business.com guide to financial success.Presented in partnership\nwith:![Rapid\nFinance](https://img.business.com/h/30-png/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9odWIvcmFwaWRfZmluYW5jZS5wbmc=)](/finance/)\n\n## If you're a budding business owner, you may need an affordable payroll\nservice, but is it wise to choose the cheapest one you can find?\n\n  * 39% of U.S. companies \u2013 that's more than 10 million businesses \u2013 outsource their payroll processing.\n  * 43% of U.S. companies outsource their payroll tax responsibilities.\n  * Payroll processing companies have security features in place, including backup systems and multiple servers, to keep your company's information safe. \n\nOperating a business comes with many costly expenses, but [hiring a payroll\nservice](https://www.business.com/categories/online-payroll-services/) doesn't\nhave to be one of them. There are many affordable payroll services, in\naddition to software, for small businesses to choose from.\n\nJust because you're looking for a budget-friendly payroll processing service\ndoesn't mean you need to settle for a barebones solution. But on the flip\nside, paying more for payroll processing doesn't always mean you're getting\nthe best value for your money. Every company works differently, and if you\ndon't need the extra bells and whistles, why should you pay for them?\n\nYou can find options that fit your budget and match your business's model and\nexpectations when you know what to look for and what to expect from a payroll\nprocessing solution.\n\n## What is a cheap payroll service?\n\nA cheap payroll service has just the basic features that a company needs to\nprocess its employees' wages, and it provides them for a low price. Choosing a\ncheap service does not mean your employees won't be paid or you won't meet\nreporting regulations, but it does mean that you will need to do more on your\nend to get the job done; it's not going to save you as much time as a full-\nservice payroll solution would.\n\n**Editor's note: Looking for the right payroll service for your business? Fill\nout the below questionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you about your\nneeds.**\n\n## How much does it cost to have a payroll service?\n\nThere's a wide [range of payroll service\ncosts](https://www.business.com/articles/how-much-payroll-services-cost/),\ndepending on the features you need and the number of employees you have. Other\nfactors that can affect the amount you pay include how many times your\nemployees are paid, whether you pay by direct deposit, how many of your\nemployees live out of state, and tax filing services. You can also buy a\nmonthly subscription at a set rate or per payroll. The set rate is typically\nthe payroll base cost plus the per-employee cost. In our testing to find the\n[best online payroll services of\n2020](https://www.business.com/categories/online-payroll-services/), we found\nbase fees ranging from $29 to $150 and per-employee fees from $2 to $12.\n\n### What makes it cheap?\n\nLike more expensive options, cheaper payroll services are usually automated\nand can help you transform hours of work into minutes \u2013 which saves you money\nas well as time. However, a cheaper payroll service may lack some of the nicer\nfeatures that more expensive plans include, such as overtime hour\ncalculations, tax filing, reimbursement payments, commission calculations or\nany service that goes beyond the basic needs of payroll management. If you\nchoose a cheaper payroll plan and the company offers these services, it may\ncharge you an additional fee to use them.\n\n## What are the advantages of a cheap service?\n\nAn advantage of using a cheaper payroll service, besides the lower cost, is\nthe quicker access you have to your information. Cheaper services usually come\nin the form of software or apps that you and your team can manage yourselves,\neliminating the middleman. This is especially useful when you discover\nmistakes that need immediate correction.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of a cheap service?\n\nIt's difficult to find a cheap payroll that offers automated tax filing and\nservice deals, which are typically a bunch of features for a set price. A\ncheaper service may take more manual operation to process your workers' hours.\nSometimes updates about new hires or terminations are also manual, which can\neat up some of your time.\n\nIt's uncommon for cheap payroll services to offer assurance checks \u2013 double-\nchecking your payroll information to ensure it's accurate. You probably won't\nhave access to the additional human resource services and benefits that\nhigher-priced suites offer either.\n\n## What are the cheapest options for payroll services?\n\nUnderstandably, small businesses typically operate on a tight budget \u2013\nespecially when they are starting out. However, the last thing you want to do\nis sacrifice quality payroll service because you're a little short on cash. If\nyou can't afford the costs of hiring and training HR specialists to run\npayroll, or if you prefer to outsource it, you have several options, including\npayroll processing companies, certified payroll processors, bookkeeping\nservices and professional employer organizations (PEOs).\n\nThe number of employees you have also contributes to the price of a payroll\nservice. If you only have one or two employees, you could do it yourself, but\nmost small business owners prefer to use a payroll service to save time and\nensure accuracy.\n\nAnother option is payroll software, which is usually cheaper and can compute\nwages, taxes, and employee checks. These solutions often charge per employee,\nso the smaller your team is, the less expensive it will be to manage payroll.\n\nRemember that free or cheaper options may be missing a few features. Lack of\ncustomer support or inconsistent payroll reports can be a problem with cheap\noptions.\n\nHere are four types of affordable payroll services you should consider and how\nyou should assess their value to you.\n\n## Is payroll software a good cheap payroll option?\n\nDo you know what's cheaper than payroll services? Payroll software. If you\nfind that even the cheapest payroll services are bleeding your wallet dry,\npayroll software may be for you. You can manage, organize and compute your\nemployees' payments with this software. It holds all your [payment\nrecords](https://www.business.com/articles/how-long-keep-payroll-records/) and\nis more affordable than payroll services.\n\n### Benefits of payroll software\n\nPayroll apps automatically calculate taxes based on state and federal\nregulations. The software also manages deductions and calculates the taxes for\npayroll, Social Security, and Medicare.\n\nAs an employer, you want to avoid violations and fees. Payroll software helps\nyou electronically file W-2, W-4, 1099, 1095 and any other payroll forms\nyou'll need for your business.\n\nPayroll software gives and your team more payroll management freedom. You can\naddress mistakes quickly without going through someone else. You can monitor\nyour information from your phone. No middleman or third-party user means fewer\npeople have access to your company's private information. It's also easy to\ncalculate bonuses and paid time off (PTO) and to automate end-of-year reports.\n\n## Are bookkeeping services an affordable payroll option?\n\nA bookkeeping service does what an in-house bookkeeper or accountant would do.\nThis service handles your transaction coding, accounts payable, accounts\nreceivable, payroll and financial reports.\n\n### How to choose the right bookkeeping service\n\nBefore you pay for a bookkeeping or accounting service, inquire about the\ncompany's payment structure. Are there annual fees? How long does it take to\nprocess your company's data? How much experience does the company have in\nemployment law compliance, and how often will someone from the company check\nin with you? With an outsourced service like this, you may not have as much\ninteraction or communication with the company as you'd like, so it's important\nto understand what you are getting into before you decide to work with one.\n\n## Is a payroll processing company affordable?\n\nA payroll processing company handles a company's payment of wages to its\nemployees by providing payroll and HR operations management.\n\n### How to choose the best payroll processing processor\n\nDo your research on a payroll company before hiring it to manage your\ncompany's data, said [Rick Fish](https://www.completepayroll.com/rickfish), a\npayroll professional certified by the [American Payroll\nAssociation](https://www.americanpayroll.org/). Ask for references. Remember\nyour company's needs and evaluate whether the payroll provider matches your\nexpectations. Look into the company's credentials and see if it has experience\nworking with a company like yours, Fish said.\n\nTo avoid using the wrong payroll processing company, there are several things\nyou should make sure the company manages and offers. At the very least, the\ncompany should automatically run and calculate payroll for each pay period.\nInquire about the level of contact you'll have with the payroll data and what\nthe process of gaining access to your data looks like. Does it take a couple\nof business days? Is there a bunch of forms to fill out or steps to take\nbeforehand?\n\nCheck if the company offers tax filing services, like managing deductions and\nW-2 and 1099 forms for employees. Does the system flag issues, and how does\nthe company notify you of those issues? Does it send alerts for employee\nbenefits eligibility or overtime?\n\n\"Make sure you have a way of confirming your taxes are being filed [in a]\ntimely [manner],\" said Alexia Matak, sales and marketing director at [Payroll\nExperts](https://www.payrollexperts.com/).\n\nMatak also encourages business owners to find out who is liable for payroll\nerrors, because it's usually you. \"Be careful of companies that say, 'We're\ntaking full responsibility,' because payroll taxes are the biggest liability.\"\n\nAnalysis reports are also a good way to give you updates and information on\nyour company. It is also important to have the function of PTO requests and a\nweb-based system so you can check in when you want.\n\nIt's good to get references for your prospective payroll providers before\nhiring one. You should also take advantage of free trials so you know what to\nexpect and can assess the service's reliability before you pay.\n\nUnderstanding the service your payroll processing company offers is key to\nsaving money. Asking the right questions will help you avoid paying added fees\nlater.\n\n## What are the benefits of payroll processing companies?\n\nMany U.S businesses outsource their payroll responsibilities to payroll\nprocessing companies. According to a recent survey by Robert Half and the\nFinancial Executives Research Foundation,[ 39% of U.S.\ncompanies](https://www.roberthalf.com/sites/default/files/Media_Root/images/rh-\npdfs/accounting_finance_benchmarking_report_2016.pdf), which equals more than\n10 million businesses, outsource their payroll processing, while 43% outsource\ntheir tax responsibilities.\n\n### Savings\n\nA payroll processing company shifts some of the administrative weight off your\nshoulders. Payroll sometimes needs to be reviewed more than once, so\noutsourcing this task can save you both time and money. Instead of spending\nthe funds and effort; calculating wages; printing, signing and sending checks;\nand preparing and paying payroll taxes, you can hire a payroll company to\nhandle all that for you. This gives you more time to work on your actual\nbusiness operations.\n\nIn addition to being a timesaver, outsourcing is a safer option. Payroll\nprocessing companies have features like backup systems and several servers to\nkeep your company's information secure.\n\n### Compliance with tax laws\n\nKeeping up with compliance can be a pain, especially with payroll tax laws\nconstantly changing. With a payroll processing company by your side, there is\nno need to keep track of those regulations, because your provider does it for\nyou. As a result, you maintain compliance with laws and avoid violations and\nfees.\n\n### Feature flexibility\n\nSome features of affordable payroll processing companies allow you to add\npayroll services through your accounting software. You can also choose how\nmuch service you want based on your budget and business \u2013 you can purchase\nfull-service or self-service payroll or anything in between.\n\n### Automated payments\n\nSame-day direct deposit is another service payroll companies offer; however,\nFish warns employers not to get swept up in the \"same-day pay\" craze if it's\nnot something you need. Some companies also provide flexible payment options,\nlike automatic payroll processing for salaried and hourly employees, and\nvaried payment schedules like weekly, biweekly and monthly. They can also set\nup automatic adjustments for tips, child support or other court-ordered\ndeductions.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of payroll processing companies?\n\nVendors that have a one-size-fits-all pricing system do not consider your\ncompany's size or specific needs in the price. In some cases, you might not\nneed all the services they provide in their base plan, which could feel like a\nwaste of money. See if you can cherry-pick what you like and just buy what\nworks best for you.\n\nThe tricky thing about dealing with a payroll company is that it might offer a\nreally low price, but only at first. Before you partner with the service, do\nyour research to avoid sneaky added fees. Sometimes prices are subject to\nchange after a year, so look out for that.\n\nRegardless of the service, a payroll processing company is a separate entity\nthat handles your company's information. For the same reason, if you need to\ncorrect a payroll error, your payroll processing company may not respond as\nquickly as you like.\n\n## How does a PEO affect your payroll?\n\n[PEOs](https://www.business.com/categories/best-peo-services/) work\nspecifically with small and midsize companies. They manage payroll taxes,\nhuman resource operations and benefits through a co-employment model. Your\nemployees will be on the PEO's books but still under your management. If you\nneed to outsource other HR tasks, like administering benefits, a PEO might be\na cost-saving option for you. If you use a company like this that offers\npayroll, it may be convenient and cost-effective to add these services to the\nones it already performs for your business.\n\n## What are the advantages of full-service payroll?\n\nA full-service payroll company is typically larger and operates almost like a\ntech company, said George Kocher, CEO of [Brand\nNorth](https://www.brandnorth.com/). Processing companies can offer a platform\nfor time tracking and time-off requests through easy-to-use smartphone\napplications.\n\n\"Because of their size, they also have strategic relationships,\" Kocher told\nbusiness.com. \"For instance, they might be able to help you create your HR\nhandbook and have free access to online hiring platforms or even attorney\nservices.\"\n\nAlthough full-service payroll companies are usually larger, they can provide\ndedicated payroll specialists to assist you. A full payroll service also\nprovides flexibility for submitting payroll information. You often have the\noption of submitting it by phone or email at any time of the day. Many\ncompanies offer automated tax filing, and some even give you access to other\nHR and benefits services.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of full-service payroll?\n\nA full-service payroll company has a lot to offer, but when you're a small\nbusiness, it might cost more than you have at the moment. You should also be\non the lookout for hidden charges like setup or account maintenance fees.\n\nCost isn't the only drawback of using a full-service payroll company. Its size\ncan make working with the payroll company feel impersonal if it doesn't assign\na payroll specialist to your account. Liability for payroll tax filing errors\nmay also be a problem. Some full-service payroll companies take responsibility\non your behalf, but some do not. This means you could be hit with fees for\nmistakes your payroll provider makes.\n\n## How do you choose between cheaper and full-service payroll?\n\nWhen choosing between cheap and full-service payroll, take time to assess what\nyou need as a company. A full-service payroll company may have everything you\nneed and more, which can be costly compared to a free or cheap payroll service\nthat's a bit more limited. The best way to decide is to weigh what you need\nagainst what you want or can do without.\n\nYou should also plan on testing out a service if a free trial is available.\nWhen using the trial, ask yourself the following questions:\n\n  * Is it easy to navigate?\n  * Does it offer tax services?\n  * What self-help resources are available on the company's website?\n  * Is its tax service management as complete as you'd like?\n\nWant more advice for your business?\n\nGet free tips from experts in our small business community.\n\nEnter your email address below.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA.

North America and\nthe Main European countries, recorded a 0.6 % organic growth in sales. This\nperformance was driven by 5.6% organic growth in North America, where each of\nthe four major solutions shows growth. The Main European countries segment\nachieved a 4.7% decrease in sales, excluding currency and scope effects.\n\n****Good dynamics in Customer Experience Management****\n\nFor full-year 2019, **Customer Experience Management** sales were up\norganically by 6.2%, at \u20ac110 million, thanks to good performance in North\nAmerica, including in particular the signature of three large deals during the\nfourth quarter of 2019. In the Main European countries, the level of activity\nremained high, but the growth rate was lower due to the high comparison basis\nof 2018.\n\nThe revenue linked to the SaaS5 subscriptions continued to grow significantly.\nRevenue related to maintenance and professional services continued to\nincrease, stemming from the growth of the customer base in previous years,\nparticularly in 2018. The Group achieved license sales in new verticals,\nnotably in utilities, government services and telecom.\n\n****Continued strong growth in Business Process Automation****\n\nFor full-year 2019, **Business Process Automation** sales were up 18.8 %\norganically, at \u20ac63 million, due to the strong momentum in France and in the\nUnited States, and with the acquisition of new customers largely due to the\ndevelopment of new offers combined with Mail-Related Solutions. Conversely,\nthe United Kingdom/Ireland region recorded a decrease in revenue due to a\ndecline in the number of license deals versus last year.\n\nSaaS5 subscriptions were up strongly, contributing to a higher level of\nrecurring revenue at 78% of the total Business Process Automation sales.\n\n****Good resilience in Mail-Related Solutions thanks to growth in North\nAmerica****\n\nFor full-year 2019, **Mail-Related Solutions** sales were down organically by\n2.8%, at \u20ac728 million.\n\nThis good resilience was reflected in growth in North America, particularly\nattributable to an increase in hardware sales, confirming Quadient\u2019s ability\nto outperform the market. Sales performance resulted primarily from optimized\nmanagement of the installed base (due in particular to the renewal of leasing\ncontracts), new customers and the development of offers combined with Business\nProcess Automation solutions.\n\nMail-related activities in the Main European countries declined moderately,\nexcept in the Germany/ Italy/ Switzerland region where the decline was\nstronger.\n\nThe level of recurring revenue for Mail-Related Solutions remains high at\nabove 70%.\n\n****Year-round robust acceleration in Parcel Locker Solutions****\n\nFor full-year 2019, **Parcel Locker Solutions** sales were up 31.2%6, at \u20ac43\nmillion, due to the sharp increase in Parcel Pending\u2019s activity in the North\nAmerican residential sector, with accelerating quarter-on-quarter growth. The\nlatter company was acquired in the United States at the end of January 2019.\nIts integration is well underway.\n\n****Additional Operations****\n\nAs announced in January 2019, as part of its Back to Growth strategy, the\nGroup continued to implement strong measures to improve the performance of the\n**Additional Operations** \u2019 scope. 2019 sales totaled \u20ac199 million, or 17% of\ntotal sales. Excluding currency and scope effects due to the divestments of\nSatori Software and Human Inference, Additional Operations sales were up 6.7%\norganically.\n\nThis growth was achieved through an excellent 42.1% organic growth performance\ndelivered by Customer Experience Management in Asia-Pacific and in the rest of\nEurope, as well as the continued expansion of Parcel Lockers in Japan\nresulting in 51.7% organic growth. The other remaining solutions (mail-related\nactivities, shipping software, graphics, automated packing systems) declined\nslightly, despite the sale of a larger number of automated packing systems (17\nunits sold in 2019 versus 10 sold in 2018).\n\nAt the end of 2019, the shutdown of activity in Australian subsidiary,\nTemando, started in the second half of 2019 was substantially progressed. It\nis now almost completed.\n\nMoreover, on March 2, 20207, the Group announced the divestment of ProShip for\nUSD 15 million. ProShip is accounted for as assets held for sale as of January\n31, 2020.\n\n  \n\n**Fourth quarter 2019 sales: seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth**\n\n**Fourth quarter 2019 sales** were \u20ac308 million, up +0.2%2 in organic terms\ndespite a high comparison basis in 2018. It was the Group\u2019s seventh\nconsecutive quarter with organic growth.\n\n**Major Operations** sales were stable, at \u20ac255 million, driven by a good\nperformance from Customer Experience Management, despite an unfavorable basis\nof comparison, and by strong growth in Business Process Automation and Parcel\nLocker Solutions. The Group notes that the fourth quarter organic growth rates\nfor Customer Experience Management (+7.2%), Business Process Automation\n(+20.2%) and Parcel Locker Solutions (+44.1%) were higher than the organic\ngrowth rates in the first 9 months.\n\nHowever, the Group posted a stronger decrease in Mail-Related Solutions\nrevenue during the fourth quarter (-4.4%) than in the previous quarters.\n\nAdditional Operations sales recorded 1.7% of organic growth.\n\n****CHANGE IN P &L****\n\n****Simplified P &L****\n\n_In \u20ac million_ |  **2019** |  2018 |  Change  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Sales** |  **1,143** |  **1,092** |  +4.7%  \n**Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses** |  **185** |\n**199** |  (7.1)%(a)  \nCurrent EBIT |  170 |  182 |  (6.9)%  \n**Net attributable income** |  **14** |  **92** |  (84.6)%  \nEarnings per share |  0.15 |  2.40 |  \\-  \nDiluted earnings per share |  0.15 |  2.27 |  \\-  \n_(a)_ _As a reminder, in 2018, current EBIT before acquisition-related\nexpenses included \u20ac7.5 million linked to icon Systemhaus\u2019 earn-out reversal_  \n  \n****Current operating income****\n\nThe Group's **current operating income** **before acquisition-related\nexpenses** stood at \u20ac185 million in 2019, versus \u20ac199 million in 2018. As a\nreminder, excluding icon Systemhaus\u2019 earn-out reversal accounting for \u20ac7.5\nmillion and taking into account scope effects recorded at the beginning of the\nyear (acquisition of Parcel Pending and divestments of Satori Software and\nHuman Inference), the Group\u2019s current operating income before acquisition-\nrelated expenses would have amounted to \u20ac188 million in 2018. Compared to this\nfigure, the change in current operating income before acquisition-related\nexpenses reflects:\n\n  * the increased resources deployed in Major Operations in order to support the acceleration in growth of the different solutions and an expanded customer base. An envelope of \u20ac15 million was allocated largely to the strengthening of the sales team and marketing activities, including Parcel Pending, as well as an increase in R&D and innovation expenses; \n  * the significant improvement in Additional Operations\u2019 profitability thanks to growth in revenue of Customer Experience Management in the rest of the world and Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan, cost reductions, sales efficiency, reduced R&D expenses for non-strategic activities and the decrease in Temando\u2019s losses as part of the phased shutdown of the activity; and,\n  * a positive currency effect amounting to \u20ac5 million.\n\n|  **2019** |  **2018**  \n---|---|---  \n|  Major  \nOperations |  Additional Operations |  **Group total** |  Major Operations |\nAdditional Operations |  **Group total**  \nRevenue |  944 |  199 |  **1,143** |  886 |  206 |  **1,092**  \nCurrent operating income3 |  181 |  4 |  **185** |  206 |  (7) |  **199**  \n  \nThe **current operating margin** before acquisitions-related expenses stood at\n16.2% of sales.\n\n**Acquisition-related expenses** totaled \u20ac15 million, at a comparable level to\nthe \u20ac17 million recorded in 2018.\n\n**Current operating income** in 2019 amounted to \u20ac170 million, versus \u20ac182\nmillion in 2018.\n\n****Operating income****\n\nAs in previous years, the Group recorded expenses for the **optimization of\nstructures** in order to continue adapting its costs to the changes in\norganization and activities. These expenses amounted to \u20ac10 million in 2019,\nversus \u20ac13 million in 2018.\n\n**Result from other operating income and expenses** stood at -\u20ac83 million,\nversus -\u20ac12 million in 2018. In particular, this included:\n\n  * the impairment of almost 100% of non-strategic activities-related goodwill within Additional Operations for \u20ac70 million : it concerns activities in the Nordic countries (essentially graphics and mail-related activities), in Australia (also mainly graphics and mail-related activities) and legacy shipping software in France;\n  * a \u20ac3 million-charge due to the reclassification of ProShip as assets held for sale, under the IFRS 5 standard;\n  * a \u20ac5 million-expense related to the write-off of the net value of intangible assets recognized as part of Temando\u2019s PPA.\n\nAs regards the impairment of goodwill, the ProShip reclassification or write-\noff of the net value of intangible assets recognized with Temando\u2019s PPA, they\nrepresent non-cash items and reflect a value adjustment of Additional\nOperations. In this respect, the Group continues to assess options, in line\nwith the strategy announced in early 2019 as part of the \u201cBack to Growth\u201d\nplan. At the end of 2019, the Group has almost no goodwill left in its balance\nsheet associated with this non-strategic activities in the Additional\nOperations.\n\nAfter recognizing these non-current items, **operating income** ended at \u20ac77\nmillion in 2019, versus \u20ac157 million in 2018.\n\n****Net income****\n\nQuadient continued to manage by anticipation the extension of its debt\nmaturity and financing cost. As a result, the Group launched two debt\nissuances in 2019, in order to refinance its future maturities:\n\n  * a _Schuldschein_ private placement in May 2019, in order to refinance its 2019 and early 2020 maturities\n  * a bond issue amounting to \u20ac325 million in January 2020, in order to refinance its existing bond issue maturing in June 2021.\n\nThese operations led to an additional expense of nearly \u20ac5 million in full-\nyear 2019. Furthermore, the Group accounted for an interest expense as a\nresult of applying the IFRS 16 standard for \u20ac2.6 million.\n\nAs a result, the **net cost of debt** amounted to - \u20ac39 million, versus - \u20ac31\nmillion in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the Group also recorded **currency** **losses and other financial\nitems** of -\u20ac2 million, versus currency gains and other financial items of \u20ac1\nmillion in 2018.\n\nTaking into account these non-recurring items, **net financial losses**\ntherefore came to -\u20ac41 million in 2019, versus a loss of  \n-\u20ac30 million for the same period in 2018. \n\nThe **corporate tax rate** ended at 58% from 29% in 2018, representing a total\namount of \u20ac22 million. This rate is owing to the impairment of goodwill\nrecorded this year. Restated for this item, the corporate tax rate would be\n20.5%. This change represents a normalization of the tax rate compared with\n2018 which specifically recorded a provision settling a long-standing tax\ndispute dating back from 2006 to 2008.\n\nFactoring in the aforementioned items, **net attributable income** ended at\n\u20ac14 million, versus \u20ac92 million in 2018. Earnings per share stood at \u20ac0.15,\nversus \u20ac2.40 in 2018.\n\n****CASH FLOW GENERATION****\n\n**EBITDA** 8 totaled \u20ac282 million in 2019 on \u20ac272 million in 2018. Excluding\nIFRS 16, EBITDA would have amounted to \u20ac258 million in 2019.\n\nThe \u20ac7 million increase in **working capital** largely owed to an increased\nlevel of inventories in preparation for needs in 2020. It was also impacted by\na slight increase in receivables in 2019, in line with momentum in the Group\u2019s\nactivity.\n\nThe Group recorded a decrease in its **lease receivables** , at a slower pace\nthan in 2018 (-\u20ac25 million versus -\u20ac32 million in 2018). The leasing portfolio\nand other financing services reached \u20ac698 million as of January 31, 2020\ncompared to \u20ac706 million as of January 31, 2019 representing an organic 3.5%\ndecrease, versus a 4.4% decrease in 2018.\n\n**Interest and taxes paid** totaled -\u20ac85 million in 2019 from -\u20ac54 million one\nyear earlier that benefitted from the \u20ac13 million received in France for\ndividend tax repayment and related-interest on arrears. Quadient also recorded\na net cash outflow of \u20ac6.6 million from the resolution of tax litigation dated\n2006-2008 as well as a cash-outflow of \u20ac8.7 million linked to the refinancing\noperations.\n\n**Investments in tangible and intangible fixed assets** are in line with the\nguidance given during the announcement of the strategic plan. They ended at\n\u20ac109 million ( _i.e._ \u20ac96 million excluding IFRS 16 standard implementation)\ncompared to \u20ac88 million in 2018, when the Group benefitted from a \u20ac5 million-\nsubsidy granted by the Japanese government to roll-out Packcity parcel lockers\nin Japan.\n\nIn total, the Group generated **cash flow after capex** of \u20ac86 million (\n_i.e._ \u20ac78 million excluding IFRS 16 standard implementation versus \u20ac152\nmillion the previous year).\n\nWhile operating cash flow was in line with the Group\u2019s expectations, in 2019,\nQuadient decided to seize the market opportunities, thereby refinancing its\n2019, 2020 and 2021 debt maturities with beneficial conditions, in order to\nincrease the average maturity of its debt. These operations had a \u20ac8.7 million\nimpact on cash flow. In addition to these items, an additional \u20ac6.6 million\ncash outflow was booked in fourth-quarter 2019, linked to the resolution of\ntax litigation dated 2006-2008. Excluding these two non-recurring items, cash\nflow would have amounted to \u20ac93 million (excluding IFRS 16 standard\nimplementation), _i.e_.; expressed as a percentage of current operating income\nbefore acquisition-related expenses, a cash flow after capex conversion rate4\nof 50.3% in full-year 2019, in line with the Group\u2019s indication.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, the **net debt** , stood at \u20ac668 million from \u20ac617\nmillion on January 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to IFRS 16 standard\nimplementation resulting in a \u20ac81 million increase in net debt. Excluding IFRS\n16 impact, net debt decreased by almost \u20ac30 million in 2019. The leverage\nratio (net debt/EBITDA) ended stable at 2.3 excluding the impact of IFRS 16.\nGroup\u2019s net debt is backed by future cash flows generated from its rental and\nleasing activities.\n\n**Shareholders\u2019 equity** was \u20ac1,249 million as at January 31, 2020, compared\nto \u20ac1,247 million as of January 31, 2019. Gearing9 decreased, to 47% of\nshareholders' equity excluding IFRS 16 impact, versus 49% in 2018.\n\n****HIGHLIGHTS****\n\n**Refinancing**\n\nOn May 15, 2019, the Group announced that it successfully raised the\nequivalent of \u20ac210 million (\u20ac130 million and USD 90 million) through a\n_Schuldschein_ , a private placement loan issued under German law. This\ntransaction, mainly intended to repay existing lines maturing in 2019 and\nearly 2020, extends the average maturity of the Group\u2019s debt with highly\nfavorable conditions.\n\nIn June 2019, Quadient has extended up to June 2024 the revolving credit\nfacility line maturity for the total commitment of \u20ac400 million thanks to the\nexercise of an extension option.\n\nOn January 16, 2020, the Group announced that it has successfully issued a new\nbond issue for \u20ac325.0 million in anticipation of the refinancing of its 2.5%\nexisting bonds maturing in 2021 (issued with a nominal \u20ac350 million and with\nan outstanding nominal amount of \u20ac327 million before the launch). This\noperation allowed the repurchase of \u20ac148.8 million ( _i.e._ 45% of the\noutstanding bond issue)10 extending the Group\u2019s average debt maturity. This\nnew bond issue will mature on February 3, 2025 and bears a 2.25% coupon\nwithout financial covenants. The book was more than twice oversubscribed. This\nnew non-rated bond was issued and admitted to trading on the regulated Paris\nEuronext market on January 23, 2020.\n\n****Phased shutdown of the activity of Australian subsidiary, Temando****\n\nIn September 2019, Quadient decided an orderly and phased shutdown of activity\nin its Australian subsidiary, Temando  \n(e-commerce shipping software), subject to Temando\u2019s legal obligations to its\ncustomers and other stakeholders. At the end of fiscal year 2019, the shutdown\nwas substantially progressed and is now almost completed. While this\nsubsidiary recorded a current operating loss of nearly -\u20ac8 million for sales\nof less than \u20ac5 million in 2018, the current operating loss for 2019 was\nreduced to -\u20ac3 million for sales of c.\u20ac3 million.\n\n****New brand****\n\nOn September 23, 2019, the Group announced the decision to change its name to\nQuadient instead of Neopost. The choice of a unified and modern brand is the\nresult of deploying a new Group organization as part of the Group\u2019s \u201cBack to\nGrowth\u201d strategy, moving away from a holding company operating independent\nbusinesses to a single company with an integrated portfolio of solutions.\n\n****POST-CLOSING EVENTS****\n\n****Divestment of ProShip****\n\nIn March 2020, Quadient announced the sale of its subsidiary, ProShip, a\nglobal provider of automated multi-carrier shipping software, to FOG Software\nGroup, a division of Constellation Software, Inc, a company listed in Toronto.\nThe transaction was closed on February 28, 2020. The selling price totaled USD\n15 million.\n\n****Continued active debt management in February 2020****\n\nIn February 2020, Quadient bought back an additional \u20ac15 million of its 2.50%\nbond maturing in June 2021. Following this buy back, the outstanding amount of\nthe bond is \u20ac163.2 million. In February 2020, to the request of some\ninvestors, Quadient offered its debt holders in the German law private debt\n_Schuldschein_ , the opportunity to extend the maturity of their existing\ninvestment maturing February 21, 2020. As a result of this transaction,\nQuadient paid back \u20ac17 million and USD 30 million and issued a new\n_Schuldschein_ for USD 3 million with a four year-long maturity and USD 10\nmillion and \u20ac30.5 million both with a five year-long maturity.\n\n****DIVIDEND****\n\nThe Board of Directors will make a decision by the end of May for the dividend\nproposal related to the 2019 financial year, which will then be submitted to\nthe approval of shareholders at the General Meeting.\n\n****INFORMATION FOR 2020 AND BEYOND****\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the Group has already\nimplemented measures aimed primarily at protecting the health of its employees\nwhile maintaining continuity of service to its customers. To date, the vast\nmajority of teams around the World are teleworking, enabling all leads,\nservice, maintenance, support and back-office activities to be performed\nremotely.\n\nThe economic impact of the global measures to control the spread of COVID-19\non the Group's business is difficult to assess and observations made so far\nshould be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, in this context, the Group\u2019s\ninstalled base business model gives it a certain resilience, thanks in\nparticular to the large proportion of recurring revenues that make up its\ntopline, whether rental or leasing revenues, maintenance or service revenues,\nor even subscriptions to its software solutions in SaaS5/Cloud invoiced as\nsubscriptions and/or on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Group has a relatively\nflexible cost base thanks in particular to the outsourcing of equipment\nmanufacturing, at c.90% in volumes of mailroom equipment systems and 100% in\nautomated parcel lockers. Finally, the Group's large customer base of 500,000\ncustomers, widely diversified both in terms of sectorial and geographical\nexposure, enables it to mitigate the impact of potential default payment.\n\n  * With respect to **Mail-Related Solutions** , the Group is starting to observe postponements of equipment deliveries and on-site maintenance operations, as well as a slowdown in leads. The Group expects this situation to continue as long as the lockdown measures are in place. In the event that the Group is unable to replace equipment reaching the end of its leasing or rental contracts, it plans to offer contract extension, which will consequently limit its cash outflow. Quadient also anticipates a drop in sales of consumables (e.g., ink cartridges) which are directly correlated to the use of mailing systems.\n  * In the area of **Customer Experience Management** , leads are beginning to be affected, as well as on-site service operations in most countries where they became impossible to be performed. Virtual meetings, however, make it possible to continue installing and developing solutions at customer sites. In a context where organizations are realizing the importance of managing multi-channel digital communications with their customers, the current environment favors the sale of SaaS/Cloud solutions.\n  * Without ruling out a potential impact on business, Quadient believes that the current environment is conducive to digital **Business Process Automation** solutions that enable the sending of dematerialized mail, electronic storage or the automation of invoice management processes. The solutions offered by Quadient can be easily installed remotely and operated in SaaS/Cloud mode.\n  * Finally, for **Parcel Locker Solutions** , the marketing and installation of parcel lockers in North America has so far been only slightly affected, but the extension of containment measures could have an impact on business. On the other hand, the automated parcel lockers activity in Japan is based on contractual rental revenues.\n\nIn order to limit the impact on results of the economic slowdown linked to the\nCovid-19 crisis and taking into account the level of inventories on hand,\nQuadient has already adapted its subcontracted equipment orders in Asia. The\nGroup\u2019s production facilities will be temporarily closed, whereas its logistic\ncenters continue to provide a minimum level of service. The Group has\ndiscontinued the use of temporary contracts and considers implementing partial\nworking measures in countries where the drop of activity justifies it. This\nreduction in payroll cost base will be supplemented by appropriate management\nof all operating costs. The Group will also conduct a careful review of\nplanned investment decisions with the aim of reducing or delaying reducible\ncapital expenditures, while preserving the potential for rolling out its\nsolutions and pursuing some of its innovation and R&D efforts.\n\nThe Group is monitoring the situation extremely closely so that it may act\nnimbly and with the necessary responsiveness to continue adapting its\noperations and cost base, while ensuring an optimal level of service for its\ncustomers. The Group will ensure the trade-offs it makes in savings will allow\nit to take advantage of the economic recovery under the best possible\nconditions, when this occurs.\n\nThe Group has a very solid cash position. At the end of January, it stood at\nc.\u20ac900 million, of which \u20ac498 million in cash and \u20ac400 million of undrawn\ncredit line, the latter maturing in 2024.

will help all\nfinancial institutions respond to the impact of COVID-19 through its live new\nprogram that provides the fastest processing of Small Business Administration\n(SBA) Paycheck Protection loans, enabling participating banks and credit\nunions to deliver instant financial relief for their small business customers.\n\nOn Friday, March 27, Congress approved the CARES Act which includes the very\nimportant Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This effort will directly help\nsmall businesses (under 500 employees) by providing cash-flow assistance\nthrough 100 percent federally guaranteed loans to employers who maintain their\npayroll during this emergency. If the employer maintains their average prior\npayroll, the portion of the loan used for payroll costs and other qualifying\nexpenses will be forgiven.\n\nThe [NYMBUS SmartLenders\nProgram](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnymbus.com%2Fsmartlenders%2F&esheet=52195867&newsitemid=20200330005206&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=NYMBUS+SmartLenders+Program&index=2&md5=684ad92386d677108c2a9fa6afe0a96f)\nlive online link is available for any business to immediately apply. This\nprovides the absolute fastest relief effort by digitizing the entire PPP loan\nprocess through a bundled solution that handles all of the required end-to-end\ntechnology and services. Participating financial institutions are simply\nprovided a portal link to direct their small business customers, where\napplications can be submitted and immediately processed online. SmartLenders\nwill automate the requests, collect required documents, perform all necessary\nunderwriting, and close the loans. The Program includes a full team of SBA-\nexperienced banking and legal experts to manage the process and ensure\nadherence with all banking and SBA compliance requirements.\n\nThere is no cost or liability to participate in the Program, and referral\npartners will share in the loan fees simply for making the referral. The goal\nis to move as rapidly as possible to help every business in the United States\nby leveraging the advanced NYMBUS ecosystem.\n\n\"In this unprecedented time, we are all seeking out ways to support one\nanother,\" said David Mitchell, President of NYMBUS. \"We have the digital tools\nand full remote processing services already in place to handle the urgency of\nplacing these vital federal funds into the hands of small business owners. In\norder to help them maintain their staff and continue operations throughout\nthis crisis, we encourage all banks and credit unions to contact NYMBUS and\nlearn how we can assist through this Program.\"\n\nFor more information about how to get started today, contact NYMBUS at\n[nymbusmgmt@nymbus.com](mailto:nymbusmgmt@nymbus.com).\n\n **About NYMBUS**\n\nNYMBUS provides the world\u2019s most advanced financial services ecosystem.

That\u2019s the prevailing sentiment as all signs point to\nthe preparation of a[new stimulus\nbill](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/30/pelosi-move-fast-rescue-\npackage-155920) in Congress.\n\nSeveral outlets reported on Tuesday morning (March 31) that House Democratic\nleaders discussed ideas for yet another package to add on to the massive $2\ntrillion bill passed on Friday (March 27) in response to the coronavirus\ncrisis. According to\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-30/retailers-\nfurlough-500-000-despite-stimulus-law-more-expected), committee chairmen and\ntheir staff are considering more than half-dozen proposals \u2014 none of which\nlook like they will help non-essential retailing, which was the heading under\nwhich hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed and entire\ncompanies are at risk.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi has signaled that her \u201cphase 4\u201d package will focus\non healthcare workers, water systems, broadband and the energy grid. \u201cIt is\nclear that we need to do more, and that is particularly true when it comes to\nprotecting the health and safety of frontline health workers,\u201d House Education\nand Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe White House officials have compiled their own lists of requests totaling\nroughly $600 billion. The proposals include more state aid as well as\nfinancial assistance for mortgage markets and the travel industries. There\nwere no retail mentions in the coverage of the White House considerations.\n\nAll this happens in an environment where non-essential retail is eligible for\nsome of the aid packages passed in the first stimulus package, most being in\nthe form of loan eligibility. Many of those retailers \u2014 Nike among them \u2014 got\nhit hard in trading Monday.\n\n\u201cI can certainly understand what they\u2019re trying to do. These names were names\nthat were previously strong before we got into this coronavirus crisis.\nSimpler Trading\u2019s options director, Danielle Shay. \u201cHowever, these are all\nconsumer discretionary names and nobody is going to be going out buying [a]\n$1,000 Goose jacket when they can\u2019t even afford their mortgage or their rent,\u201d\nShay told CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Trading Nation](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/).\u201d\n\nThe idea of a new stimulus received a powerful advocate Monday in L.L.Bean CEO\nStephen Smith. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really serious situation, and I actually don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s getting enough attention,\u201d Smith told\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/ll-bean-ceo-congress-must-do-more-to-\naddress-serious-retail-crisis.html) on Monday.\n\nSmith said essential retailers were holding up amid the coronavirus pandemic,\nwhile retailers with less than 500 employees are eligible for the [small\nbusiness loans](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/chris-van-hollen-on-small-\nbusiness-loans-in-coronavirus-relief-bill.html) in the [$2 trillion stimulus\npackage signed Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/house-\npasses-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-sends-it-to-trump.html) by\nPresident [Donald Trump](https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/trump-\nsigns-2t-covid-19-stimulus-package/).\n\nBut there is a \u201chuge segment in the middle\u201d that is so far \u201cbeing missed,\u201d\nSmith said. \u201cAll of those apparel retailers, every label of a piece of\nclothing that someone is wearing right now, all of them are struggling\nmightily with full rent, full payroll and, if they\u2019re store-based, close to\nzero sales. That\u2019s a group that needs attention in the next stimulus package\nfor sure.\u201d\n\nThe stimulus discussion comes as some retail chains struggle. GameStop, which\ntried to declare itself an \u201cessential\u201d business before closing its stores, is\nnow struggling for survival. In its annual report last Thursday, the company\nreported $6.5 billion in annual revenues in 2019, down 24 percent from 2018.\nWhile it cut net losses 35 percent last year, the company still remained $470\nmillion in the red.\n\n\u201cGameStop already had it tough going into this year, confronted by new seismic\nshifts to mobile and cloud-based subscription gaming,\u201d [said Peter\nCsathy](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/game-over-gamestop-struggling-\nretailer-130032164.html) chairman and founder of CREATV Media, a consulting\nfirm that advises gaming and media companies. \u201cAnd now this pandemic, which\ninstantaneously shutters much of the retail world \u2026 Those are 1-2 gut punches\nthat have the potential to knock them out.\u201d\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

an HR professional, you usually don\u2019t have to deal with payroll tasks\nbeyond the basics when onboarding a new employee.\n\nBut making sure workers get paid is essential to your job, since you\u2019ll be the\none dealing with any complaints.\n\nAnd you want a system that streamlines payment processes and keeps your\nbusiness compliant with [IRS regulations and\nrequirements.](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.htm)\n\nMost HR software solutions have a payroll module that comes preloaded, but if\nyours doesn\u2019t consider talking with your software vendor to see if it can be\nadded on.\n\nThere are many benefits to having [payroll\nsoftware](https://www.betterbuys.com/payroll/) integrated with your HR system.\nYou can customize the system as needed to cut down on menial tasks, smooth out\nyour onboarding process and ensure payments are quick and accurate. Plus,\ncompliance with confusing tax laws is easier with a system that updates\nregularly.\n\nFirst, here are the essential features and functions of any payroll software\nsolution.\n\n## **Key features**\n\nYour payroll software solution should include the following features, all of\nwhich can improve your company\u2019s processing and systems:\n\n    * **Payroll processing:** The ultimate function of any payroll software is the ability to process the various facets of payroll, including timekeeping and overtime pay rates.\n    *  **Direct deposit:** Employees don\u2019t want to wait for paper checks, but luckily most payroll software can connect with banks to disburse payments directly to workers\u2019 bank accounts immediately. This also cuts down on the potential for mistakes or lost payments.\n    *  **Tax filing help:** The best payroll solutions have automated calculations for when tax time comes around that can pre-fill employees\u2019 tax info with the data already in the system and avoid any human input errors. Another plus? Your taxes will always be filed on time. \n    * **Compliance tools:** To keep workers\u2019 data safe, payroll solutions should have robust compliance measures. And since state, local and federal tax laws are ever changing, an automated system ensures your company is always on the right side of the law. \n    * **Self-service:** Let employees do some of the work for you with self-service portals that let workers log on and see their payroll information. They can fix any mistakes with their data and input their own time attendance, leaving the important work to the payroll professionals.\n    *  **Accounting help:** Certain accounting functions can be integrated into a payroll solution as well, streamlining the entire Finance process and opening your teams up for more collaboration. \n\nThese features can all provide benefits to your organization, like removing\ntedious tasks from your Finance employees\u2019 workloads and ironing out\nonboarding and other HR-essential processes.\n\n## **Automate tedious tasks**\n\nTo an HR professional, maybe all payroll tasks seem tedious. But for payroll\nemployees, the simple stuff is where help\u2019s needed. Inputting data, handling\nleave requests and sorting through overtime submissions all take time away\nfrom the important job of managing wages for every employee.\n\nAny payroll processing system worth its salt can help with those tasks. If the\npayroll processing is integrated with other HR systems, it can pull time clock\ninformation to accurately determine how much hourly employees get paid.\n\nPayroll employees also won\u2019t be required to calculate taxes and deductions\nmanually, since the payroll system does it automatically. Your system can also\nsend automated emails reminding managers to approve employees\u2019 time so your\nFinance staffers don\u2019t have to chase people down.\n\nIn addition, automating time off requests and other data entry means Payroll\nemployees can spend their energy on hurdles that crop up or other, more\ncomplicated duties.\n\n## **Reduce paycheck questions**\n\nAny payroll professional will tell you: Right after employees get their\npaychecks, the questions come rolling in. People want to know why numbers\nchanged and where their money is going if it\u2019s not going straight to them.\n\nMost payroll solutions have self-service options, which are key for decreasing\nthose simple questions your Finance department receives. Employees should be\nable to easily access their payment information, including stubs and W-2\nforms.\n\nAnother benefit? If any information is incorrect, workers can see it and\ncontact Payroll or HR to get it fixed.\n\n## **Streamline onboarding**\n\nAn automated payroll system can go a long way towards improving the experience\nfor new hires \u2013 which directly impacts HR.\n\nNew employees can use the self-service options to upload the necessary forms\ndirectly to the system, without needing HR to handle the processing or store\nmultiple copies.\n\nInstead, the forms are already in the system, allowing them to be edited if\nneeded and immediately used for payroll.\n\nThis also saves your HR team time and energy to focus on the [most important\nparts of onboarding](/articles/onboarding-2019/), such as training.\n\n## **Get people paid accurately**\n\nNo matter how much your employees love working for your company, they also\nwant to get paid correctly and on time.\n\nDirect deposit functions in most payroll solutions can help, since people can\nget their checks immediately and not have to make a trip to the bank to\ndeposit a check.\n\nAnd self-service portals mean workers can get up-to-the-minute info on when\ntheir money will be available.\n\nNote: When payroll information is accessible to employees, you\u2019ll want to\nremind them to check it regularly, especially if they move or other major life\nchanges occur. You don\u2019t want to deal with missed checks due to incorrect or\noutdated info.\n\nAutomated payroll processing also reduces common errors that can happen when\nhumans are the ones inputting information. A mistyped keystroke can mean the\ndifference between $100 and $1,000, and you don\u2019t want to over- or under-pay\nyour employees.\n\n## **Boost compliance**\n\nKeeping track of every local, state and federal tax law that governs how you\nwithhold money from employees\u2019 paychecks is a tall order. You need to stay\ncompliant, but quickly-changing laws can make it seem almost impossible at\ntimes.\n\nNewer payroll software monitors those laws and other regs so you\u2019re never\nplaying catch-up with compliance and can ensure all your deductions are\naccurate and lawful.\n\nThis also eases the burden on your Payroll employees, who won\u2019t have to be\nmonitoring compliance requirements as closely, although they should still\nreview updates regularly to keep everything running smoothly.\n\n## **Major challenges**\n\nDespite all the benefits integrating your payroll and HR software can bring,\nthere are some significant challenges to consider before making the switch.\n\n**Change management**\n\nHR knows this better than anyone: Change management is often complex. Letting\neveryone know about serious changes to the way they work can lead to pushback,\nespecially from older employees who are used to the way things are done.\n\nBe sure to lay out the benefits that come with adding a new solution and\nthoroughly explain why you\u2019re switching things up. Emphasize how much easier\npayroll tasks will be now and tell workers about their new options for\naccessing information.\n\nFinance staffers in particular should receive ample warning before anything\nchanges and take their critiques into account.\n\n**Vendor communication**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to make the change, you\u2019ll need to figure out whether an\nentirely new solution would be best or if your current HR software has a\npayroll module you can customize.\n\nHR, IT and Finance will need to work together to find the right solution for\nyour company, so make sure communication between departments is consistent.\n\nIn addition, dealing with third-party vendors is often a hassle and it can be\neven worse to add a new vendor to the mix. Clearly communicate what you\u2019re\nlooking for and what you want to get out of the solution. Remember to review\nagreements in-depth before partnering with any vendor.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to check with the vendor to see what support is available\nonce the solution has been implemented. Many vendors offer 24-hour helplines\nor onsite assistance as needed, which is useful if any issues crop up.\n\n**Training employees**\n\nArguably the most important piece of the puzzle is [training\nemployees](/articles/employee-training-program-lms/) on how to use the new\nsystem. There will be questions and concerns about the impact of new software\non paychecks, so let workers know how much smoother the entire payroll process\nwill be.\n\nTalk with your vendor to figure out how training should work and what major\nquestions they\u2019ve been asked \u2013 that way you can address them before they\u2019re\nasked.\n\nPayroll and Finance employees will obviously have more extensive training than\nother workers, but every staffer should receive at least a basic tutorial.\n\nYou\u2019ve likely trained workers on new systems before, so let those previous\nexperiences guide you. Review any documentation you have from those previous\ntraining sessions to see what worked and what didn\u2019t.\n\nWork with IT to see how software will be implemented on people\u2019s computers and\nif additional equipment or further training will be necessary.\n\nDespite the challenges when implementing a new payroll system, the time and\nmoney saved makes integrated payroll and HR software well worth it.\n\nYour Payroll staffers will have more time and energy to spend on complicated\ntasks and will receive fewer questions about the process, and workers will\ncontinue to get paid quickly and accurately. Plus, onboarding and compliance\nduties will also be streamlined, so you\u2019ll be ready for anything that gets\nthrown at you.\n\n[![Coronavirus & Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Coronavirus\n& Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HRM-coronavirus-\nwebinar-1.png)](https://www.learningpremier.com/product/coronavirus-influenza-\nobligations-under-fmla-ada-title-vii-\nmore/?utm_source=hrmorning&utm_medium=display&utm_content=8170&utm_campaign=coronavirus-03-31-2020)\n\n## Primary Sidebar\n\n#### Keep Up To Date with the Latest HR News\n\nWith HRMorning arriving in your inbox, you will never miss critical stories on\nlabor laws, benefits, retention and onboarding strategies.\n\nSign up for a free HRMorning membership and get our newsletter!\n\n    * Email*\n\n    * username*\n\n    * formOffer\n\n    * businessUnit\n\n    * businessUnitId\n\n    * brand\n\n    * brandId\n\n    * event*\n\n    * controlCode\n\n    * Phone\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n[ ![HR Morning\nLogo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![HR\nMorning Logo](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/genesis/assets/images/logo-white@2x.png) ]()\n\n    * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4898679/)\n\n    * [ABOUT HRMORNING](https://www.hrmorning.com/about/)\n    * [ADVERTISE WITH US](https://www.hrmorning.com/advertise-with-us/)\n    * [WRITE FOR US](https://www.hrmorning.com/write-for-hr-morning/)\n    * [CONTACT](https://www.hrmorning.com/contact/)\n\n    * [Employment Law](/pbp-categories/employment-law/)\n    * [Benefits](/pbp-categories/benefits/)\n    * [Recruiting](/pbp-categories/recruiting/)\n    * [Talent Management](/pbp-categories/talent-management/)\n    * [HR Technology](/pbp-categories/hr-technology/)\n    * [Performance Management](/pbp-categories/performance-management/)\n    * [Leadership & Strategy](/pbp-categories/leadership-strategy/)\n    * [Compensation & Payroll](/pbp-categories/compensation-payroll)\n    * [Policy & Culture](/pbp-categories/policy-culture/)\n    * [Staff Administration](/pbp-categories/staff-administration/)\n    * [Wellness & Safety](/pbp-categories/wellness-safety/)\n    * [Staff Departure](/pbp-categories/staff-departure/)\n    * [Employee Services](/pbp-categories/employee-services/)\n    * [Work Location](/pbp-categories/work-location/)\n    * [HR Career & Self-Care](/pbp-categories/hr-career/)\n\nHRMorning, part of the Catalyst Media Network, provides the latest HR and\nemployment law news for HR professionals in the trenches of small-to-medium-\nsized businesses.

An epiphany of sorts that only you\nexperienced. You wrote about it, thought about it, and dreamt about it. For a\nfew months that followed, there was nothing else that mattered more to you\nthan working on that one idea.\n\n  \n\nAfter months of this relentless pursuit, your idea finally begins to take\nshape. You decide to take that leap and get started. You have now set up shop\nand your business is up and running.\n\n  \n\nThis is typically how most of the new ventures are born.\n\n  \n\nBut what sets a few promising new ventures apart from many businesses that\ncome and go is this: a business' decision with regard to how it chooses to\nhandle it's hiring requirements and it's administrative tasks.\n\n  \n\n**A new venture 's success heavily depends on these two variables. If hiring\nthe right team is one of the key pillars of your business, then having a good\nsystem in place that helps you manage the team efficiently is another.**\n\n  \n\nIf you have successfully juggled many roles and helped your business stand on\nits own feet, you are probably looking to grow. Congratulations on getting\nthis far!\n\n  \n\nNow, it's time for you to hire your very first (or first few) employee(s).\n\n  \n\nAnd this is where a good Payroll Management System comes into the picture.\n\n  \n\nAs Peter Drucker, the father of management thinking, famously said, \"what gets\nmeasured, gets managed.\"\n\n  \n\nA good Payroll Management System becomes a very vital element in the way you\nconduct your business' administrative tasks.\n\n  \n\nNow that we have learnt the importance of having a good payroll process in\nplace, let's understand what a Payroll Management System actually is?\n\n  \n\n## What is a Payroll Management Process?\n\n  \n\nA payroll management system is a tool - predominantly a software program -\nthat enables your business to handle all your employee's financial records in\na hassle-free, automated fashion. This includes employee's salaries, bonuses,\ndeductions, net pay, and generation of pay-slips for a specific period.\n\n  \n\n## Why do you need a payroll process for your business?\n\n  \n\n![payroll management\nsystem](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/shutterstock_1719449151561883832714.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  \n\nAs you would have already realised, your business activities are primarily\ndivided into two broad categories: the macro and the micro.\n\n  \n\nThe macro here refers to the broader and big picture stuff. These are the\nactivities that aid the long-term vision of your organisation. Your business\ndevelopment strategy, sales, revenue, cash flow, etc., fall under this\ncategory.\n\n  \n\nThe micro refers to the everyday administrative chores that fuel the day-to-\nday operations of your business. Although these tasks seem mundane and\nrepetitive, they are just as important to keep your business running like a\nwell-oiled machine.\n\n  \n\n> By having a payroll process in place, you are essentially automating a few\n> of those micro administrative tasks so that you have the mental bandwidth to\n> focus on the macro.\n\n  \n\nYou don't have to worry about manually handling things like generating pay-\nslips, calculating tax deductions and so on. All of this can be automated by\nusing a payroll management system.\n\n  \n\nBefore I go further and talk about the kind of payroll systems that are\navailable in the market and how to choose one, let's take a look at some key\nbenefits of using a reliable payroll process\n\n  \n\n## Key benefits of a payroll management system\n\n  \n\nThere are several benefits of implementing a service like this for your\nbusiness. Some of them have been briefly highlighted below:\n\n  \n\n  *  **Employee morale -** By making sure your employees are paid in a systematic and timely manner, you are reinforcing their faith in your business' financial integrity. This will boost employee morale and motivate them to perform better.\n\n  \n\n  * **Statutory compliance -** This refers to the legal framework your business must adhere to. As an employer, you are required to maintain various payroll and payment records of your employees. Every organisation that hires employees and pays salaries must comply with the labour laws. By having a payroll process in place, you are automatically complying with the employment and labour laws in India.\n\n  \n\n  *  **Manage employee information efficiently -** You will be able to accurately store and manage all your employee information in one place. There will be no need to use any additional tool for this purpose.\n\n  \n\n![e\npayroll](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/info1562225358840.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  * **Generate reports related to employee attendance, salary structure, etc. -** A good payroll system will facilitate this process seamlessly. This can be extremely valuable when you are looking to retrieve information for any queries related to these matters.\n\n  \n\n  * **Startup friendly -** As a new business, you may not have enough budget to allocate to every aspect of your business. Most of the payroll services are free for the initial few employees or charge a minimal fee; making it easy for you to afford setting up a service like this.\n\n  \n\n  *  **Time-saving -** Since everything in a payroll management system is automated, you will be saving a lot of time. You don't have to manually enter the information for every cycle. You set it up once and let the software handle the rest. The only thing you will probably do is new employee registration for every new hire.\n\n  \n\n  * **Plan for the future -** Most of the payroll management services provide a forecast feature. You can use this to plan staff costs and other relevant expenses. This will help you get a good picture of how much your business should be making in order to accommodate all the expenses and still operate profitably.\n\n  \n\n## Key features for selecting a Payroll Management Service\n\n  \n\nThere are a few features that are an absolute must; irrespective of the size\nof your business.\n\n  \n\nWhen you are deciding between multiple payroll products, please ensure that\nall (or most) of the features mentioned below are included.\n\n  \n\n### Easy setup and on-boarding\n\n  \n\nA payroll service you choose to work with should be easy to set up without a\nlot of technical difficulties. Employee on-boarding should be smooth and\nseamless.\n\n  \n\nEven if you are someone who hasn't done any of this before, the service should\nenable you to figure out all of this intuitively or with the help of a\ncomprehensive checklist. Most of them should be able to provide one-click\nsolutions.\n\n  \n\n### Automatic payrolls/payslips\n\n  \n\nIt should have the ability to automatically compute and process payrolls\naccurately for each payment period. It should also generate customised\npayslips and also enable direct deposits into your employee's bank accounts.\n\n  \n\n### Run on the cloud\n\n  \n\n![payroll processing in\nindia](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/clo1562225819763.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nThe service should be able to run on the cloud and give you the flexibility to\naccess it from anywhere and from your shortlisted devices. This way, you will\nstill be able to administer timely payouts even if you are busy with other\nobligations.\n\n  \n\n### Personalised salary components and structure\n\n  \n\nYou should be able to input different salary components such as earnings,\nallowances, deductions, and reimbursements for multiple employees with varying\npay grades. You should be able to clearly establish your company's salary\nstructure.\n\n  \n\n### Inbuilt compliance\n\n  \n\nIt should enable auto calculations of deductions such as Provident Fund,\nProfessional Tax, ESI, Income Tax, etc. Many of these tax laws are dynamic and\ncan change from time to time. The service you choose should adapt accordingly\nand make precise calculations.\n\n  \n\n### Tax filing\n\n  \n\nBoth your business and your employees should be able to effortlessly file for\ntax declarations directly from your payroll portal.\n\n  \n\n### Reporting tools\n\n  \n\nIt should help you generate multiple reports based on your requirements. An\nexample would be a reconciliation report or a summary of professional tax\nreport and the likes.\n\n  \n\n### Employee self-service portal\n\n  \n\nAn ideal product should also have an employee self-service portal that can be\naccessed by your people. This is important as it will allow them to keep track\nof their salary payments, tax deductions, and other important information in\none place. This will also help them update their address and contact\ninformation if any changes occur.\n\n  \n\n### Employee expense claims\n\n  \n\nYour employees should be able to claim out-of-pocket business expenses or any\nother spending that requires reimbursements.\n\n  \n\n### Integrations\n\n  \n\nIf you are already using other software to manage your business such as an\naccounting tool, the payroll service you select should offer flawless\nintegration with such pre-existing software. It is important to verify this\ncompatibility before you finalise on a payroll product.\n\n  \n\nFor example, Zoho Payroll (a very popular service in this segment, one that I\nwill discuss in a later section) integrates with Zoho People, which is a\ncomplete online HR solution.\n\n  \n\n### Biometric attendance\n\n  \n\nThis comes at an additional cost as it is not included in basic features\ndiscussed in this section. But it is a good option to keep in mind for future\npurposes.\n\n  \n\nThere are also a lot of really good options that offer dependable payroll\nprocesses in India today. But, I will get to that momentarily.\n\n  \n\nBefore we jump that far, I want to help you get a deeper understanding of all\nthe umpteen elements that are part of the Indian payroll calculations.\n\n  \n\nThe following section offers a brief summary of how these calculations are\nactually made. Let's learn a bit about each of these payroll components\n\n  \n\n## Payroll calculations in India\n\n  \n\nIndian payroll calculation is complicated. There are many variables that need\nto be factored in.\n\n  \n\n![indian payroll\ncalculations](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/pay1562225978327.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  \n\nThese calculations constitute four main components: basic salary, gross\nsalary, deductions, and net pay\n\n  \n\n **CTC = Gross Salary + PF + Gratuity**\n\n  \n\nBasic Salary is the fixed income of an individual. It is the fixed part of\none's compensation package. Basic pay is 50 percent of gross salary.\n\n  \n\n **Gross Salary** is the sum of basic salary and other allowances before tax\nand other deductions.\n\n  \n\n**Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + other allowances**\n\n  \n\nThere are a few variables that are mandatory deductions. Deductions include\nincome tax, EPF, ESI, and PT.\n\n  \n\nTherefore, **Net Pay = Gross Salary - Deductions**\n\n  \n\nIf you don't understand what some of these terms stand for, do not worry. I\nhave included a section titled 'Glossary' at the end of the copy. It has a\nlist of all of these terms and explains what each of them stands for. You will\nget a clear picture when you go through that list.\n\n  \n\nNow, let's explore what are the available options for payroll management\nsystems in the Indian market today.\n\n  \n\n## Payroll software\n\n  \n\n### Microsoft Excel\n\n  \n\nThere are a handful of free payroll software options in India. In fact, one of\nthem is already handy on your computer. That is the good old Microsoft Excel.\n\n  \n\nAs a business owner, you will already be familiar with Excel and all of its\nincredible capabilities. Did you know that you can use Excel as a payroll\nprocessing tool as well? Yes, that right. Excel lets you set up a payroll\nsheet, for free.\n\n  \n\nMost businesses typically get started with Excel while handling their first\nfew hires.\n\n  \n\nAll you have to do is open Excel, click on the \"File\" tab in Excel, select\n\"New\". Search for a payroll template by typing \"payroll\" in the search box (at\nthe top right corner of the new window). Browse through the available\ntemplates and pick one that best suits your needs. The images included below\nshow you the steps.\n\n  \n\n![Excel as a payroll processing\ntool](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/Payroll_management_excel1561657077747.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  \n\n![Excel as a payroll processing\ntool](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/Payroll_process_excel1561657186051.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  \n\nHowever, one of the major drawbacks of using Excel is that it can get tedious\npretty quickly. For one, you will have to manually enter all the details such\nas employee name, allowances, deductions, etc. And then input the right\nformula for each of these calculations.\n\n  \n\nAs we have learnt earlier, payroll calculations are fairly complicated. You\ncan still manage with this tool if you just have an employee or two, but it\nmay not be the best system for accurate and error-free calculations.\n\n  \n\nIf you want to continue exploring free options, there are a host of those\navailable as well.\n\n  \n\n### Sumopayroll.com\n\n  \n\nSumopayroll is a cloud-based platform that comes with inbuilt features such as\ncompliance, expense tracking, automation, and others as discussed earlier.\n\n  \n\nThe best part is that you get free access to all these features for up to ten\nemployees. After you cross ten employees, you will have to pay a fee of Rs 49\nper employee per month.\n\n  \n\nIf you are willing to look at paid options from the get-go, in the following\nsection, I have discussed a few popular options that are trusted by many\nbusinesses and have proven to be dependable in the long-run.\n\n  \n\nIf ease of setup combined with ease of calculations is a key deciding factor\nfor you, your safe bet would be to get started with one of these services.\n\n  \n\n### Zoho Payroll\n\n  \n\nZoho Payroll is one of the most popular payroll management systems in India\ntoday. It is a web-based application that entirely runs on the cloud.\n\n  \n\nThe reason it is so popular is because of its ease of setup, simple and\nintuitive user interface and its ability to seamlessly perform and automate\ncomplex payroll calculations.\n\n  \n\nZoho Payroll offers a 30-day free trial. The basic plan (billed annually)\ncosts Rs 50 per employee per month.\n\n  \n\nIn order to help you get a better idea, I have included a few images that show\nhow easy it is it set up Zoho Payroll. Zoho has in-depth explanations of each\nstep in the setup process.\n\n  \n\nOnce you go to the sign-in page and create a Zoho account, you will be\nprompted to set up your business information.\n\n  \n\n![payroll\nsoftware](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/zoho1561884842983.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\nSimilarly, you will be able to proceed further and add all other relevant\ninformation required to successfully set up Zoho Payroll. This includes tax\ninformation, pay schedule, salary components, and others.\n\n  \n\n![best payroll software in\nindia](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/zoho_payroll_s1561884893833.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)![best\npayroll software in\nindia](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/zoho_payrol1561884953479.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)![payroll\nprocess](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/zoho_paayroll1561884969286.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\nAs you can see in the picture above, you will have the ability to add all\nthese complex salary component variables directly into this platform and enjoy\nthe benefits of automated calculations that Zoho Payroll provides.\n\n  \n\nZoho Payroll also offers an Employee Portal, which provides a clean and\nsophisticated user experience to your employees. It also has a payroll app for\nboth iOS and Android users.\n\n  \n\nEmployees can download the Employee Portal - Zoho Payroll app from the App\nStore or Google Play and access all of their salary information on the go.\n\n  \n\nZoho Payroll also supports integration with other software such as Zoho Books\n(Accounting), Zoho People, and GreytHR (Human Resource) to name a few.\n\n  \n\nThis kind of integration with other tools that you might use to manage\ndifferent verticals of your business is important.\n\n  \n\nThe only disadvantage of this platform at the moment is that it lacks time and\nattendance module but that might be included soon.\n\n  \n\n### Paybooks\n\n  \n\nIf you have a team of 20 employees or more, Paybooks is another popular\nsoftware in this segment. It is a cloud-based, all-in-one HR and payroll\nsoftware.\n\n  \n\nPaybooks also offers a free 30-day trial. The price is Rs 1,800 per month for\nup to 20 employees and Rs 50 per month for every additional employee\nthereafter.\n\n  \n\nYou can also outsource your entire payroll process to Paybooks. You can get a\nquote by reaching out to them.\n\n  \n\n### GreytHR Payroll Software\n\n  \n\nJust like Zoho Payroll, GreytHR is one of India's most popular payroll\nsoftware. It streamlines every aspect of the payroll process and helps you\nmanage everything on a cloud-based web application.\n\n  \n\n![payroll\nsoftware](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/fb7ee200-7579-11e9-995c-171c030e4eb8/payrp1562236364498.png?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n  \n\nOne of the key advantages of GreytHR is that it has a sophisticated attendance\nand leave management module. You can get started for free and purchase a\nsuitable plan if you are satisfied with the trail.\n\n  \n\nThere are many other options in addition to what I have discussed here. Keka\nPayroll, PeopleWorks, and Saral PayPack are among the many others available in\nthe market today.\n\n  \n\n## Conclusion\n\n  \n\nAt the end of the day, no one knows and understands your business better than\nyou. You are the only one who can determine what your business' current needs\nare.\n\n  \n\nUse all of the information discussed in this article as a reference point to\ndo your own research. You can also talk to the existing users of these payroll\nplatforms and get some feedback.\n\n  \n\nPersonally reach out to the sales teams of each of these software platforms\nand discuss your requirements in detail.\n\n  \n\nBy now, it must be clear that having a good payroll software takes away a lot\nof stress and administrative burden off your shoulders. So be sure to do your\ndue diligence thoroughly and take a wise call in this regard.\n\n  \n\n## Glossary of payroll terms\n\n  \n\n### CTC\n\n###  \n\nCTC means Cost to Company.

Small businesses can now run\npayroll and file taxes automatically, as well as receive tax penalty\nprotection and access on-demand human resources, health benefits, and workers\u2019\ncompensation.\n\nQuickBooks Online Payroll now comes in three tier options,\n[_Core_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/core/),[\n_Premium_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/premium/) __ and[\n_Elite_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/elite/). All three tiers\ninclude payroll and automated tax filing, and Premium and Elite come with\nTSheets time tracking. Intuit acquired TSheets in 2017.  \n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/8c/83/2e1193c14fc89c22b24dd02d1c80/intuit-\ncampus.jpg)  \nThe TSheets acquisition has proven key to the developing out of QuickBooks\u2019\npayroll products. Laurent Sellier, vice president and business leader of\nQuickBooks Online Payroll, said that he learned how important TSheets had\nbecome to QuickBooks Online Payroll users during one of Intuit\u2019s accountant\ncouncil meetings, where Intuit staff listen to ideas and insights from\naccountants.\n\n\u201cI asked one accountant to share how he runs his business, and he said any\ntime he has a new customer that needs payroll, they provide full service\npayroll, including TSheets every time,\u201d Sellier recalled. \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s\nall automated. At that point, I talked to some other leaders at Intuit about\nwhether time tracking should be something we provide. Six months later, we\nbought TSheets. Now the big innovation \u2014 making TSheets available as part of\nPayroll so you don\u2019t have to buy something else. We removed the seams between\nPayroll and TSheets. It\u2019s one offering, well integrated.\n\nAnother highlight of the new suite is tax penalty protection, offered in the\nElite tier. This feature protects the accountant in case of error in tax\nfilings, Intuit assuming the risk.\n\nQuickBooks Online Payroll users also now have the option to have live experts\nreview their setup. The experts are full time Intuit staff on the Payroll\nsupport team who specialize in payroll onboarding.\n\nFinally, a feature worthy of mention is the new online information portal,\naccessible to any user, including clients. The portal was created in\npartnership with HR tech provider Mammoth, and is integrated directly into\nQuickBooks Online Payroll.\n\n\u201cWe hear not only from small businesses but also from accountants that HR is a\ngrowing area for questions and stress,\u201d said Sandy Edwards, group product\nmanager for QuickBooks Online Payroll. \u201cThat\u2019s why we created an online portal\npowered by Mammoth, giving users access to a host of questions, forms, and\ninformation. It\u2019s embedded in QuickBooks, so they don\u2019t have to go anywhere\nelse.\u201d\n\nThe key features of the new QuickBooks Online Payroll, broken down by tier,\nare as follows:\n\n **Core**  \nPreviously known as QuickBooks Online Self-Service Payroll, QuickBooks Online\nPayroll Core is QuickBooks\u2019 simplest solution for automated payroll and\nincludes:\n\n  * Full-service payroll includes automated tax and forms;\n  * Auto Payroll;\n  * [ _Next-day direct deposit_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/direct-deposit/);\n  * Automated federal and state payroll taxes (including year-end filings);\n  * A Workforce Portal for employees;\n  * Product support from U.S.-based experts;\n  * [ _Health benefits_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/employee-benefits/) for employees powered by Simply Insured.\n\n **Premium**  \nPreviously known as QuickBooks Online Full-Service Payroll, QuickBooks Online\nPayroll Premium includes all the features of Core, as well as:\n\n  * [ _Same-day direct deposit_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/direct-deposit/) _;_\n  * Time tracking on the go;\n  * Expert setup review;\n  * HR support center powered by Mammoth.\n\n **Elite**  \nThis new, top-tier offering was designed specifically for growing businesses.\nIn addition to all the features provided in QuickBooks Online Payroll Premium,\nElite customers receive:  \n\n  * Manage projects and track time on the go;\n  * White glove customized setup by U.S.-based specialists;\n  * [ _Tax Penalty Protection_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/disclosure/);\n  * An on-demand HR advisor powered by Mammoth.\n\nFor more information, follow the embedded links.

With modern\ntechnologies shaping the human resources department, here is a look at how the\npayroll trends are evolving in 2020 and how you can effectively adapt to them.\n\n### **Automate Your Payroll**\n\nThis era of digital industrialization emphasizes the importance of automation.\nIt\u2019s not just the product lineup that you should be automating. Everything\nfrom sending out newsletters to sending out paychecks is also under a dire\nneed of automation.\n\nManual payroll has almost come to a halt and there are hardly any companies\nout there where someone is personally moving out to hand the employees their\nmonthly compensation. Automation has several advantages over traditional\nmethods, which are:\n\n  * Automated payroll is less prone to errors when compared to manual payroll. The calculations involved can be intense when it has to be done manually.   \n\n  * Automation makes the payroll process extremely fast and efficient. It is known to reduce payroll time significantly.   \n\n  * Timekeeping can be done efficiently which includes the calculation of compensation given to each employee depending on the hours they have dedicated. This will include overtime payment and deduction in the case of time shortage. With automated timekeeping systems like biometric or RFID, the chances of errors are reduced to almost nil.   \n\n  * Automation can also be cost-effective in many cases. If the number of employees of a company involved with payroll management is plenty, an automation [system](https://paybooks.in/payroll-management-system-features/) can definitely prove to be cheaper and faster.   \n\n  * Automation will also avoid any kind of delays. No delays will ensure the employees are always happy and don\u2019t have to go through any extra trouble because of something that\u2019s not their fault. \n\n###  \n**Keep a Track of Your Employees and Improvise**\n\n  \nIdentifying the top talent in a company and retaining them is the key to\nkeeping the company ranking high up the charts in all indices. Continuous\nmonitoring of data is the best way to analyze the performance metrics of each\nemployee and compensating them appropriately.\n\nThere are many **SaaS** agencies that help with people\u2019s analytics and data-\ndriven decisions to make the best of the available resources.\n\n  * Data Analytics is a growing field and can be used in payroll management as well. The data such as target completion and leaves taken can be collected through automated systems  \n\n  * Tracking Key Performance Indicators has been identified as one of the most important things to better understand your employees and compute various data related components like processing time per cycle, incomplete payments and the possible errors that might occur.   \n\n  * While tracking is the key, constant improvement is needed to make the best of it. The best thing to do is to merge similar processes to give the best to your employees. For example, HR and payroll need to be unified, otherwise, each process going on in one corner is going to make things very inefficient.   \n\n  * **Outsourcing** the analytics needs can be one of the best possible solutions to overcome the problem because hiring in house analytics team can sometimes be costlier and not be feasible for some small companies. \n\n  \n**Learn More:[How Faster Payments Are Impacting the Future of\nWork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-\nfaster-payments-are-impacting-the-future-of-work/)**\n\n### **Step up the Security**\n\nUndoubtedly, security and safety is the most important parameter in the age\nwhere cybercrimes have become so common. Luckily, this year\u2019s focus is going\nto be on the safety of the payroll data and this is being commonly employed in\nvarious companies.\n\n  * The payroll software and tools available are fairly secure as they are password protected and have various levels of encryption to ensure nobody can breach it. \n  * Automated security also means there are no papers that can be left lying around and the risk of it getting into the hands of the wrong person is completely eliminated. \n  * Since the system will make sure that no double entry is present, the account of the company is safe and any losses in terms of duplicate transactions cannot take place. \n  * **SaaS** makes sure that any payroll software provided to a company is void of defects and cannot be broken into. \n\n  \nWhile these trends are what is expected in the upcoming year, nobody can be\n100% sure about the future and that\u2019s why adaptability is very important. All\nsystems and tools that are being used should be interoperable and flexible to\nadapt to upcoming technology.\n\nStaying close to these trends is going to be one of the best things for the\npayroll management of your company and you can enter the new year prepared\nwith the best of knowledge.\n\n**Learn More:[Rewarding Human Capital Management (HCM) with

_Digital process will allow small business owners to get faster access to new\nloan program, helping them meet upcoming operating expenses such as rent\npayments_\n\nTORONTO , April 1, 2020 /CNW/ -  **CIBC** ([CM](/q?s=cm)) ([CM](/q?s=cm))\ntoday announced it is launching a fully digital application process for\nclients eligible for the new Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) as part\nof the federal government's $25 billion loan program for Canadian small\nbusinesses.\n\nThe new digital application process will allow small business owners who bank\nwith CIBC to apply for the CEBA in just minutes once the loans are available\nbeginning the week of April 6 th. Clients will be notified when the\napplication date is announced. Once the loan is processed, funds will be\ndeposited directly to their CIBC Business Operating Account.\n\n\"We know many small businesses in Canada have an urgent need to access the\nloan program announced by the federal government, so we have fully automated\nthe loan application and disbursement process to get funds flowing as fast as\npossible,\" said Laura Dottori-Attanasio , Senior Executive Vice-President and\nGroup Head, Personal and Business Banking. \"We're focused on making the\napplication process as easy as possible, helping our clients access these\nmuch-needed funds quickly to provide stability in the near term.\"\n\nThe CEBA is designed to support small business owners in meeting their\nimmediate cash flow needs and includes:\n\n  * A $40,000 interest-free, government\u2011guaranteed loan to help pay for operating costs that can't be deferred as a result of COVID\u201119.  \n  * $10,000 (25%) of the $40,000 loan is eligible for complete forgiveness if $30,000 is fully repaid on or before De\u200dcember 31, 20\u200d22.  \n  * If the loan cannot be repaid by De\u200dcember 31, 20\u200d22, it can be converted into a 3\u2011year term loan at an interest rate of 5%.  \n\n  \n\nBusinesses and not for profits will be eligible to apply for this loan if they\nhave:\n\n  * an operating company registered in Canada ; \n  * annual payroll of between $50,000 and $1 million (based on your 2019 T4SUM Summary of Remuneration Paid); and \n  * CIBC as their primary bank. This means that the business uses a CIBC Business Operating Account (opened on or before March 1, 2020 ) for day-to-day payments and cash management activities. \n\n  \n\nTo be ready to apply for a CEBA as soon as it becomes available, clients\nshould ensure they have registered for [CIBC Online Banking for\nBusiness](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2766548-1&h=2873503369&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cibc.com%2Fen%2Fbusiness.html&a=CIBC+Online+Banking+for+Business)\nand have their T4 Summary of Renumeration Paid available to supply key\ninformation for their application.\n\nSince launching a dedicated small business support centre last week, thousands\nof business owners have already contacted CIBC to have loan payments deferred\nand receive advice on managing their short-term cash flow.\n\n\"It is important that we continue to act quickly to support small businesses\nacross Canada ,\" added Ms. Dottori-Attanasio. \"They are the backbone of our\neconomy, employ millions of Canadians and need our help now.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/loans/2020/sba-struggling-to-meet-demand-for-relief-\nloans/) __\n\nAn old computer system and too few employees are making it hard for the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) to meet the high demand for coronavirus relief\nloans, according to a[\nreport](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/coronavirus-ppp-small-\nbusiness-aid.html) in the New York Times on Tuesday (April 7).\n\nThe $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses rolled out\non Friday (April 3) to help keep people afloat in the wake of the worldwide\ncoronavirus. The daily demand for loans is more than the SBA processes in a\ntypical year.\n\nSo far, $50 billion across 178,000 loans have been approved according to Larry\nKudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Bankers and businesses,\nhowever, said very little money has been dispersed.\n\n\u201cThe expectation that this $2 trillion package would go through Congress and\nthat the money would be flowing three days later, that was never a realistic\nexpectation,\u201d said Patrick Ryan, the chief executive of First Bank, a New\nJersey lender. \u201cBut I get why people are frustrated.\u201d\n\nErik Anderson, co-owner of a Midwest hair salon chain Scissors and Scotch,\nsaid he and his partners were told by their banker Union Bank & Trust that\nthey were approved for the loan, but more paperwork is needed to proceed.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit clunky,\u201d Anderson said, noting that they still have no\nidea when they will see the money.\n\nBankers are pointing to the SBA\u2019s slow computer system as being the main cause\nof the delays. Lenders are struggling to get applications across the SBA\u2019s\nonline system, which went down altogether on Monday (April 6). It also takes\nhours to reach SBA officials for assistance.\n\nFurther, community banks are nearly out of cash. The Federal Reserve announced\nearlier this week that a new program was in the works that would facilitate\nbuying the loans from banks, but no information has been released yet.\n\nNew Jersey attorney Scott Salmon has assisted 75 small businesses with\napplications for PPP loans \u2014 but fewer than 10 have been notified of\napprovals, and none have gotten any cash.\n\nThe PPP is [designed](https://www.pymnts.com/loans/2020/bumpy-first-days-smb-\nppp-demand/) to offer loans backed by the federal government to SMBs with up\nto 500 employees.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/the-habit-restaurants-now-owned-by-\nyum-brands/) __\n\nThe Habit Restaurants is now owned by Yum! Brands, which also claims Taco\nBell, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and other luminaries of American fast\nfood under its belt,[according to a\nrelease](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005659/en/Yum%21-Brands-\nCompletes-Acquisition-Habit-Restaurants/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-\nfLcmYSZsqlD_XPbplM8Ta6D8R-QU5o2AvY8bhI9uvWSD8DYIYv4TIC1g1u0AKcacnnViVjtb72bOP4-4nHK5iej_DoWrIhfD31cAxcB60aE).\n\nThe Habit Restaurants was acquired by Yum! after approval by stakeholders of\nThe Habit Burger Grill. This marks the first time Yum! has counted a fast-\ncasual brand among its arsenal of eateries.\n\n[Yum!](https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/yum-brands-sales-grow-10-pct-\namid-digital-delivery-kiosk-innovation/) acquired Habit for $14 per share and\na total of around $375 million. The deal was funded with cash on hand and\nutilizing the company's available borrowing ability.\n\nThe Habit Burger Grill was founded in 1969 as a venue for made-to-order\nburgers and other items chargrilled over an open flame. They also serve\nchicken sandwiches, sushi-grade chargrilled ahi, salads and more.\n\nThe restaurant grew its average unit volumes (AUVs) from around $1.2 million\nin 2009 to $1.9 million last year, representing a 53.9 percent increase during\nthat period. The restaurant has grown from 26 locations in California to 271\nlocations across 13 states, along with locations in China.\n\nUnder the new agreement, The Habit Burger Grill will remain based in Irvine,\nCalifornia, and will operate as an independent subsidiary of Yum! Brands. CEO\nRuss Bendel will report directly to Yum! CEO David Gibbs.\n\nGibbs said [the acquisition](https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-\nacquisitions/2020/taco-bell-parent-yum-brands-to-acquire-habit-restaurants/)\nmade sense because of Habit's potential for growth in areas of the country\nthat don't have access to one of the restaurants. Franchisees will have new\nopportunities with another brand added, he pointed out. Habit will also be\nable to utilize Yum!

If the members of this\nteam are overwhelmed or don't have the resources they need to perform their\njobs, the entire organization will suffer. Fortunately, such a thing as HRIS\nsystems exists.\n\n**What are the types of HRIS systems?**  \nHuman resource information system (HRIS) refers to a software solution used in\nmanaging employees and in the procedures for keeping them engaged and\nproductive. HRIS systems typically fall into two categories, according to\nMitrefinch:\n\n**HCM**  \nThe systems that fall under the human capital management (HCM) category are\naimed at recruiting and retaining employees throughout their life cycle. They\ncan include anything from recruitment and onboarding tools to salary planning,\nbudgeting, goal-setting, and performance assessment. These tools assist the HR\nteam in guiding employees toward success.\n\nAnalytics are also an integral part of HCM solutions and can be useful in\ntracking employee red flags and predicting growth potential. These solutions\ntend to be more detailed than HRMS solutions and are often used in an\nexecutive-type white-collar setting.\n\n**HRMS**  \nHuman resource management systems (HRMS) may contain some elements of HCM\nsolutions, but they also have several tools to help employees as well. These\ninclude an efficient and flexible way for workers to clock in and out, manage\ntheir schedules, and easily communicate with colleagues even if they are\nworking remotely.\n\nOn the HR side, these solutions can be integrated into payroll and onboarding\nprocesses to make tasks easier for the HR team. They can also lessen the\nnumber of mistakes and improve the oversight that can be made with a manual\nprocess.\n\n**What are the components of HRIS systems?**  \nHRIS typically has six components, according to Bizfluent:\n\n**Company database**  \nAn essential HRIS system component is a database where all pieces of\ninformation about employees and company HR procedures will be stored for use\nin other HRIS tools. Aside from conveniently storing all data in a central\nlocation for easy access, this database comes with features to keep your data\nsecure, updated, and free from corruption.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nAutomated backups are a common feature that HRIS systems use to prevent data\nloss. Often, there's also access to technical support in case you have trouble\naccessing your data or experience an emergency.\n\n**Financial components**  \nHRIS also includes components for handling payroll, benefits, and employee\nrecognition programs. The payroll and benefits components will maintain\ninformation such as salary rates, commission and incentive plans, payment\naccounts, and paycheck deductions (e.g., taxes, retirement plans, and\ninsurance options).\n\nUsually, there are options to automate payouts, calculate taxes, and enroll in\nbenefits. If your organization rewards employees with bonuses or gift cards\nfor great work, financial components have reporting tools that can help\ndetermine these rewards.\n\n**Time and attendance**  \nAnother key HRIS component helps with keeping track of the time during which\nemployees work and any incidents of absence or tardiness. Such information can\nbe sent to the financial components to ensure that employees are paid fairly.\n\nAlso, these tools can automate employee scheduling, send managers alerts when\nattendance problems occur, and allow for documentation of time off and\nextended leave requests. Some systems even make it possible for employees to\nclock in remotely and support biometrics options.\n\n**Recruitment and onboarding**  \nHRIS systems come with components that ease the work done throughout the\nhiring process, including posting job applications, handling employee\nreferrals, sending interview requests, and tracking applicants. Often, you can\naccess applicant profiles, record notes from job interviews, conduct\nemployment tests, perform background checks, and send job-offer letters.\n\nOnce employees are hired, there are tools that can automate onboarding\nactivities such as document signing, new employee record keeping, and\ncompliance administration.\n\n**Employee management**  \nYou can use this component to track employee performance, make changes to\nemployees' personal information, document feedback from performance reviews,\nand maintain information about salary, benefits, and disciplinary history.\n\n**Training and development**  \nMost HRIS systems provide an option to design a training path for employees\nand even integrate training courses, tests, and professional certification\npreparation in a portal that employees can easily access. They also record\nemployees' progress and can even use work performance metrics to check whether\nthe training has helped employees improve and assign additional training\nexercises as needed.\n\nSince these tools can support employee ranking, they come in handy when\nconsidering which workers to promote. It's particularly helpful when deciding\nabout succession planning within your organization.\n\n**What are the benefits of HRIS systems?**  \nHere are four ways your organization can benefit from an HRIS, according to\nNamely:\n\n**Employee self-service**  \nAn HRIS stores all your company policies, benefits information, and company\nresources in one accessible location, so employees know exactly where to look\nfor the answers to all their questions. They can connect with colleagues,\nrequest time off, enroll in benefits, and check paystubs on demand from their\nlaptops and mobile devices without interrupting you.\n\n**Centralized employee communication**  \nInternal messages can get lost easily. An HRIS can act as the central hub for\nyour organization's internal communications. Modern HR systems offer a\nnewsfeed where the HR team can post announcements, recognize outstanding\nemployees, and share updates. The platform can also boost employee engagement\nby acknowledging employee birthdays, start dates, and work anniversaries.\n\n**Increased HR automation**  \nAs your organization grows, your time might be better spent on strategic\ninitiatives - not day-to-day administrative tasks. An HRIS can help streamline\nyour daily tasks by automating simple processes such as overseeing employee\nonboarding, benefits enrollment, and tax forms - giving you time to manage\nyour employees and focus on your team's initiatives.\n\n**Powerful people insights**  \nUsing an HRIS enables you to make more strategic decisions. By storing all\nyour company and employee data in one place, you get a more holistic view of\nyour organization and can better identify areas for improvement. Aside from\nHR, payroll and benefits, HR software typically offers powerful integrations\nwith other point solutions to move data seamlessly between systems. Using your\nHR data through consistent reporting not only helps your organization achieve\nits business goals but also empowers you to make more informed decisions and\nprove impact.\n\n**How much is an HRIS system?**  \nHRIS costs can vary from as low as $1 per month per employee to thousands of\ndollars a year. As for huge enterprise HRMS systems like PeopleSoft, SAP,\nSage, and Workday, they may cost larger firms thousands or even millions of\ndollars to implement. Fortunately, newer cloud-based HR software fills the gap\nfor small businesses by offering online HRMS systems that allow employers to\npay by employee or contractor (user) with no setup fee, with price ranging\nfrom about $1 to $15 per month per employee.\n\nWhen choosing an HRIS, these are the costs that you should consider, according\nto FitSmallBusiness:\n\n  * Software - HR software for small business costs between $1 and $15 per month per employee. Some firms add monthly fees, while others provide only the basics.\n  * Setup fees - These are used to pay for the time of configuring the software to a company. Price ranges from zero to thousands per year, depending on the vendor.\n  * Consulting fees - These vary from zero (if included in your software subscription) to about $150 per hour if you seek the help of an outside HR consultant.\n  * Support fees - Some HRMS software companies charge additional support fees that may run a few hundred dollars per year.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Readers Choice 2019: Time and Attendance Management System | HRM Asia -

This can be particularly difficult in Singapore, where\nrecruitment - and retention - is seen as a major challenge for businesses\noperating amidst evolving regulation. HR professionals are key to attracting\nand retaining talent and establishing policies for employee's growth and\ndevelopment, but they get stuck doing payroll, office management and reactive\ntasks, which massively restricts the more strategic elements of the role. It\nis time to consider moving your payroll operations to trusted HR service\nproviders to undertake the regular, but vital, basic HR functions. Here are\nthree ways in which this approach benefits your business.\n\n**It helps you to focus on strategic HR activities**  \nThe role of HR is changing. It is no longer just an administrative function\nwith a focus on payroll, statutory compliance and maintaining personnel\nrecords, but rather has evolved to supporting long-term business growth within\norganisations.\n\nWhilst payroll doesn't contribute to revenue, it is, of course, a crucial\nfunction. If payroll is carried out poorly, it will adversely impact an\norganisation. Handling payroll effectively requires significant time and a\ndeep knowledge of wide-ranging statutory requirements - and this is the core\nskillset of a professional managed services provider.\n\nSuch providers can reduce the risk of HR resource crunch due to employee\nturnover and failing to comply with local regulations, allowing you to focus\non truly transformative HR projects. They can give you the time to build your\nbrand and build an employee value proposition.\n\n**It harnesses the full power of technology**  \nAdvances in technology are helping businesses to scale and provide a better\nemployee experience. A single portal to access HR and payroll data will be\nmore convenient for the company and their employees as everything is under one\nplatform.\n\nAs businesses grow, they require access to more data for analysis and have\nincreased reporting demands. HR professionals can plan the activities in\nadvance when they have complete visibility of payroll processes and\noperations. Employees also want technology that can offer self-service access\nto their payroll information such as payslips, leave applications, expense\nclaims and timesheet data. Payroll processes will certainly be more efficient\nwhen the data collection is changed from manual to electronic.  \nWorking with a specialist external provider and their online tools allows you\nto improve efficiency and enhance the employee experience.\n\n**It reduces costs whilst increasing security**  \nPayroll providers offer a cost-effective and secure option by being a one-stop\nshop for payroll processes and technology. The alternative is for\norganisations to engage with and manage multiple providers, separately\noffering payroll services or payroll software, and paying for the software\nlicence cost and maintenance cost, which increases the total cost of\nprocessing significantly. You will receive the latest technology from a\nprofessional payroll services provider, and their experts will also provide\nlocal compliance and data security to minimise risk.\n\nIt is critical to select a managed services provider with relevant security\ncertification and standards to protect sensitive payroll data and personal\ninformation. International standards such as International Standard on\nAssurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, ISO 27001 should form part of your\nassessment criteria when you select a payroll servicer provider.\n\n**Next steps**  \nThere are significant benefits, both financially and operationally, when\nmoving your HR administration and payroll to a professional managed services\nprovider that has a large, local team of administrative and specialist staff.\n\nYour own HR team can then be more involved with driving strategy for the core\nbusiness to help deliver future growth. A specialist provider has the\nexpertise and focused functions to manage regulatory change and to provide a\nconsistent and efficient service encompassing the latest technology. The\nincorporation of automated services improves the employee experience and\nsafeguards your employees' information.\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

It was set up to\nfind a way to update payroll systems.\n\nPento said: \u201cAlthough a monthly occurrence, payroll remains one of the most\nmanual, error-prone and innovation-lacking business processes out there.\u201d\n\nWith its new payroll service, Pento estimates that it can cut between 50pc and\n80pc off the time companies spend on payroll each month, by automating\neverything from tax reports to payments, and providing payroll managers with a\nseamless, modern and real-time payroll experience.\n\nUsers don\u2019t need payroll experience to operate the software. If they run into\nany issues, the start-up offers instant support via online chat or phone.\n\n## **Growing the company**\n\n\u201cAt previous companies, I was responsible for figuring out payroll,\u201d Larsen\nsaid. \u201cI would quickly realise there was no simple and user-friendly product\navailable \u2013 only complex, old payroll software.\n\n\u201cBecause of that we ended up with an inflexible and manual process where we\nwould send spreadsheets back and forth to our accountant, making it all feel\nlike we were sent back to a previous decade. Later, we realised how bigger\ncompanies had the exact same problem, just at a much larger scale.\u201d\n\nPento\u2019s cloud-based SaaS payroll has more than 400 customers in Denmark\nalready. The company is primarily focusing on SME clients and has plans to\nlaunch in the UK following its latest round of investment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to continue the journey with some of the best investors\nin the game,\u201d Larsen added.\n\n\u201cAs we spent more and more time with the team at Point Nine, it became clear\nthat we\u2019re getting a very experienced, hands-on partner on our team. Having\nsupport from Seedcamp and our existing investors made everything come together\nvery nicely, and I\u2019m sure we couldn\u2019t be in a better position to continue\ngrowing the company.\u201d\n\nRelated: [future of work](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/future-of-\nwork),

You\nhave to take charge of running the business operations, ensure optimal\nhospitality for your guests, and manage employees. One of the biggest\nchallenges, especially if you are not an accounting professional, is\nrestaurant payroll. To give payroll the attention it requires, many restaurant\nowners are adopting payroll software for their business. The use of the\npayroll software not only increases the efficacy but can also make the entire\npayroll process as hassle-free as possible for the owners.\n\n### Benefits of Payroll Software\n\n###### 1\\. Accurate Labor-Planning\n\nPayroll software plays an important part in tracking labor. It is essential to\nhave a clearly defined employee role and pay before a new employee is hired.\nLabor planning gets more efficiency if a clear onboarding plan for new\nemployees is maintained. It not only helps you to integrate them smoothly, but\nalso helps in setting up the right tax bracket, properly plan employee\nschedules, and collecting the right paperwork. Using payroll software for\nsetting up new employee profiles with all their information eliminates the\nneed to manually refer to the data while planning employee payroll and\nschedule.\n\n###### 2\\. Automated Calculation of Wages\n\nWith the introduction of payroll software, you can say goodbye to Excel sheets\nand calculators as it helps to calculate wages automatically. It is a pain to\ncalculate shift premiums like overtime, split shifts, and statutory holiday\npay, especially when the employees are paid different wages. Also, if your\npayroll runs in multiple states or provinces, the eligibility and calculation\nrules can vary. This is where payroll software comes into play and solves\nthese major challenges. It also minimizes the chances of human errors in\ncalculations.\n\n###### 3\\. Efficient Timekeeping\n\nPayroll goes hand-in-hand with timekeeping. Payroll software automatically\nfunnels manager approved hours to your payroll provider. Hence, integrating\npayroll software with time tracking system saves you time and money and helps\nto streamline your payroll process. You save on payroll expenses when you\nminimize the steps and time taken to process the work hours.\n\n### Choosing Payroll Software\n\nFor finding the right solution to all your needs, there are a number of things\nthat you should keep in mind while choosing payroll software for your\nrestaurant.\n\n###### 1\\. Number of Employees\n\nIt is important to keep track of how many employees you need to process the\npayroll for as many payroll solutions are divided and priced by the employee\nnumber. Make sure to include starters and leavers because even if someone\nleaves, their details will still remain in the payroll software for year-end\nreporting.\n\n###### 2\\. Number of Users and Companies\n\nGet a clear idea of the number of companies/clients that your business has to\nprocess the payroll for, as it is important to check if the software you want\nto purchase includes the license for the required number. Similarly, if you\nplan to install the software on a server to allow multiple users to access it\nremotely or from a local server, make sure that your software and license\nallows the same.\n\n###### 3\\. Legislation Compliance\n\nMake sure the software package you use is legally compliant.\n\n###### 4\\. Mobility Requirement\n\nA cloud payroll software will cater to your needs if you have a requirement to\nprocess payroll from multiple locations or if you would like to have access on\nthe move from mobile devices. Providing you access from anywhere; cloud\npackages also have an option where you can pay on a monthly basis.\n\n###### 5\\. Is a Trial Available?\n\nTrying out a payroll software before you go ahead and buy it gives you a\nchance to evaluate the software against your requirements. Many providers give\nan option of a trial period before you can commit to buying a software. This\ngives you the satisfaction that what you are investing on, will work for you.\n\n###### 6\\. Have you Used Payroll Software Before?\n\nIf you have used any payroll software previously on training courses or\nemployment, and you found it helpful, it is advised to go ahead with a\nfamiliar software as it will allow you to hit the ground running. If you were\nnot satisfied with your previous software, evaluate the reasons why and make\nsure your next choice does not reflect the same.\n\n###### 7\\. Integration Issues\n\nIf you want your payroll software to be integrated with biometric systems or\nneed to import information from other software, check in advance that your\npayroll software package allows the same. Be informed on which integrations\nand import features are available.\n\n### Integrating Payroll Software\n\nBefore you begin your payroll software implementation in your business, here\nare some things to keep in mind.\n\n###### 1\\. Manage Previous Payroll Records\n\nEntering previous payroll details into your new software is important not only\nfor the continuity, but also for the accurate calculation of taxes and\ndeductions.\n\n###### 2\\. Collect Data from Different Systems\n\nIt may seem time-consuming, but it is essential to collect the data from the\nexisting systems that were used to house the employee details. All the data,\nlike Leave & Attendance, Taxation, etc., should be collated so that it can be\nintegrated with the new payroll software.\n\n###### 3\\. Clear Tax and Compliance Issues\n\nIdeal payroll software should be able to calculate taxes automatically and\naccurately so that it is easy to stay in compliance with all the legal\nrequirements and regulations.\n\n###### 4\\. Set up a Maker-Checker System\n\nThe principle of the maker-checker system is that for processing the payroll,\ntwo individuals will be involved; One who makes the payroll and the other who\napproves it. Defining this system in your payroll process ensures that proper\nchecks and control are applied, and there is no scope of error.\n\nMany businesses have integrated payroll software in their payroll processing\ntask because of the  advantages that it provides. The restaurant business is\nno different as the use of payroll software has eased the accounting of many\nowners. Just choose your payroll software wisely, considering your business\nrequirements, and you are good to go.\n\n  * [__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://modernrestaurantmanagement.com/choosing-the-right-payroll-software-for-your-restaurant/?utm_campaign=social_media&utm_source=share_links&utm_medium=facebook \"Share via Facebook\")\n  * [__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmodernrestaurantmanagement.com%2Fchoosing-the-right-payroll-software-for-your-restaurant%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dsocial_media%26utm_source%3Dshare_links%26utm_medium%3Dlinkedin&title=Choosing%20the%20Right%20Payroll%20Software%20for%20Your%20Restaurant&summary=&source= \"Share via LinkedIn\")\n  * [__](http://twitter.com/share?text=Choosing%20the%20Right%20Payroll%20Software%20for%20Your%20Restaurant&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmodernrestaurantmanagement.com%2Fchoosing-the-right-payroll-software-for-your-restaurant%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dsocial_media%26utm_source%3Dshare_links%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter \"Share via Twitter\")\n\n![](https://modernrestaurantmanagement.com/assets/media/2020/01/Avneet-\nNarang-e1579030066175-175x175.png)\n\n## Avneet Narang\n\nAvneet Narang brings more than 10 years of experience in digital marketing,\nbranding, advertising and public relations to her role as a Marketing Manager\nat Cogneesol, a specialized services company.\n\n[ ![Modern Restaurant\nManagement](/assets/public/img/modern_restaurant_management_logo.svg)\n](https://modernrestaurantmanagement.com)\n\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/Modern-Restaurant-Management-796036373852522/ \"Facebook\")\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/bcastiglia44 \"Twitter\")\n  * [ __](https://www.linkedin.com/company/10417735?trk=vsrp_companies_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A89165661457707509438%2CVSRPtargetId%3A10417735%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary \"Linkedin\")\n  * [ __](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVZRZ5NByaukWnRs_zQJRQ \"Youtube\")\n\n## Sign-Up to MRM\n\nWant more than five articles a month?

ADP and Paychex currently dominate\nthe market, but new vendors are emerging and will continue to do so over the\nforeseeable future \u2013 offering new choices to businesses. New market entrants\nare generally localized, focusing on small and midsized local businesses. The\nnew wave of vendors aims to differentiate themselves based on personalized\nservices and intimate knowledge of the clients\u2019 business environment.\n\n## **Big Players Forced to Adapt**\n\nThe new market landscape threatens established players purchasing smaller\ncompetitors at a surprising rate.\n\nThis is great news for business owners. Increased competition is leading to\nmore comprehensive offerings for a full suite of human capital management\nservices. It is also pushing pricing down for key products. The newly\ncompetitive environment benefits customers who want to outsource some, but not\nall, of their payroll and HR needs. Vendors are now offering small and\nmidsized businesses package options to choose from, along with options to\npurchase functionalities in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n**Learn more:[How to Automate Payroll for SMBs: A Complete\nGuide](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-to-\nautomate-payroll-for-smbs-a-complete-guide/)**\n\n## **New Technologies**\n\nAs the competition increases, payroll providers have no choice but to\nincorporate new technologies into their offering:\n\n  * **The Cloud:** Cloud computing offers clients flexibility and a more convenient way to access information and communicate with remote workers.\n  * **Mobile Access:** As cloud technology makes it easier to access payroll information remotely, many clients desire mobile app access to their data.\n  * **Automation:** Automation allows for faster processing and greater accuracy than is attainable through manual processes.\n  * **Artificial Intelligence:** While still in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to perform advanced payroll tasks with minimal human input eventually. As this technology continues to mature, payroll providers are exploring ways to incorporate AI into offerings.\n\n## **What to Consider When Choosing a Payroll Provider**\n\nWith so many new products and a sea of customized offerings, it is becoming\nmore difficult for HR professionals to navigate the landscape and pick the\nsolution that\u2019s best for their organization. Below, we highlight five factors\nthat HR professionals must consider when selecting a payroll provider:\n\n  1. **Necessary Features:** Most crucially, clients must choose payroll solutions that possess their required functionalities. Typically, smaller clients with less developed needs only require straightforward solutions featuring basic functionality like payroll, tax filing, W-2s and 1099s, compliance services, and new hire reporting. Many local providers fulfill these basic needs. However, clients with bigger demands might be better off outsourcing their payroll to larger companies that are more likely to offer several solution packages with features tailored toward clients of different sizes.\n  2. **Price:** Of course, the price remains a crucial consideration when selecting a payroll vendor. Currently, most solutions require a single monthly base fee in addition to small, add-on costs for each employee. However, the pricing of various services also differs based on the provider and the included features **.** Clients must weigh their budget constraints against the above considerations when selecting a payroll provider.\n  3. **Ease of Use:** A payroll solution with excellent features is worthless if the client cannot leverage it effectively. The user interface is a critical consideration when selecting payroll providers. Clients should look for providers offering intuitive interfaces that are easy to learn.\n  4. **Customer Service:** If (or when) things go wrong, it must be easy for clients to reach their provider for assistance. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than waiting days for an answer to a simple question that should have taken minutes. For this reason, we recommend that clients test out the responsiveness of different providers\u2019 customer service lines before settling on a provider.\n  5. **Seamless Integration:** Finally, clients must ensure that their chosen payroll product integrates seamlessly with their existing solutions. Of course, this is necessary because a lack of such integration will result in delays, headaches, and additional costs to the client.  \n\nThe payroll services landscape is shifting in a way that favors the customer.\nNew offerings and solutions are finally making outsourcing a viable option for\npayroll services. But more than ever, businesses must be informed and up-to-\ndate regarding the market to ensure they get the best solution.\n\n**Learn more:[Transforming Payroll With RPA \u2013 Everything You Need

Alas, this meant switching up its plan for each\ncompany to have a recorded pitch on the Demo Day website; instead, each\ncompany pitched via slides, a few paragraphs outlining what they're doing and\nthe traction they're seeing, and team bios.

Modernizing Workforce&BODY=I found this article\ninteresting and thought of sharing it with you. Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/payroll-technology-modern-wage-\ninnovation/) __\n\nWith virtual assistant technology pressing deeper in corporate finance, bots\nand artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools deploying natural language\nprocessing are[popping\nup](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/virtual-assistant-corporate-\nfinance-oracle/) from logistics management to accounting \u2014 and payroll is no\nexception.\n\nAt the macro level, the benefits of virtual assistant technology often relate\nto the ability for machines to automate data processing and analytics, and\nthen present that information to professionals in a conversational way. For\npayroll technology firm [Alight Solutions](https://alight.com/), the decision\nto [launch](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/alight-pulls-\nvirtual-assistant-tech-into-payroll/) a virtual assistant, Eloise, stemmed\nfrom the need for payroll managers to have an automated way to process troves\nof historical payroll data in an effort to identify errors, anomalies and\ntrends.\n\nAlight Executive Vice President, HCM and Financial Solutions Colin Brennan\nrecently told PYMNTS that it\u2019s not just virtual assistant and AI technology,\nbut their combination with machine learning that has the greatest impact for\nimproving accuracy and efficiency in an ever-changing payroll ecosystem.\n\n **Technology For The Payroll Department**\n\nPayroll is changing, he said, and becoming more complex as employers demand\nnew ways to compensate their employees. That means more workers don\u2019t fall\nunder the category of receiving a paycheck every two weeks for the same\namount. Rather, some employers may want to pay workers based on tasks\ncompleted, commissions, even location.\n\nFor payroll service providers, this elevates complexity, too. A payroll\nprocessor might accurately process payroll for a client based on the various\ninformation a company has provided. However, if those inputs are inaccurate or\nincomplete \u2014 including salary, commissions, travel across different states,\nbonus cycles, professionals that are on leave, and more \u2014 then payroll\ninaccuracies are sure to emerge.\n\nWhere AI and machine learning come in is being able to take all of those\ninputs, as well as years of historical payroll data, to more accurately assess\nwhether a worker\u2019s paycheck is correct or not.\n\nThe emergence of virtual assistants and AI in payroll isn\u2019t the only\ntechnological trend emerging in response to shifting payroll needs.\n\nBrennan highlighted the growing demand for global payroll support as another\npressure forcing payroll providers to examine how they can offer services that\ncan grow and flex as a company expands across borders \u2014 while also allowing\nthat company to maintain accuracy when compensating workers in other markets,\ntoo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing organizations that have traditionally been single-country, or in\nsome cases single-state, employers, going abroad more quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs\nthe world becomes smaller from a digital, commerce, and connection\nperspective, the aspect of global payroll is becoming more important.\n\n **Payroll Evolution For Professionals**\n\nEvolution in payments technology, and changes to the ways consumers want\naccess to their money, have also imposed shifts in the payroll space.\n\nBrennan pointed to the evolutionary shift that has taken payroll from paper\npaychecks, to direct deposit, to payroll cards and, today, eChecks that allow\nan employer to email a paycheck to a worker. There\u2019s also the increasing\ninterest in daily payment solutions: biweekly payroll emerged from the amount\nof time it took employers to aggregate employee data, process it and print and\ncut paper paychecks. While technology has enabled these processes to\naccelerate, the tradition of biweekly pay has stuck around \u2014 which, Brennan\nnoted, can be particularly painful for those employees living paycheck to\npaycheck, and those that receive an unexpected bill in the middle of a pay\ncycle.\n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, the rise of the gig economy, which adds complexity in\nproviding a holistic experience in wage compensation, tax deduction and\nbenefits for a professional that may be working three freelance jobs.\n\nBrennan also highlighted the emerging trend of employees now looking to\nreceive their paychecks not from direct deposit, payroll card or eCheck, but\nvia push payment into mobile wallets and payment technologies like Apple Pay.\n\n **Building Trust**\n\nFinally, shifting regulations have also forced the payroll industry to make\nsome changes, said Brennan.\n\nEarlier this week, Forbes\n[highlighted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/10/07/irs-\nannounces-new-per-diem-rates-for-taxpayers-who-travel-for-\nbusiness/#61798ef92186) the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s recent changes to\nprofessionals that travel for business, with new per diem rates coming into\neffect at the start of the month. The rules impact how much money employers\ncan provide to workers on a per-day basis before it becomes taxable.\n\nIn New York, state officials have subpoenaed dozens of payroll processors as\npart of a broader investigation into the ongoing [MyPayrollHR\ncollapse](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/ny-ag-subpoenas-\ncompanies-in-mypayroll-scandal/), allegations of fraud, and concerns over\nwhether payroll companies should be forced to obtain a license to operate.\n\nWhile Brennan declined to comment on the MyPayrollHR case specifically, he did\nhighlight the increasing complexities of payroll regulations \u2014 both for\nemployers and payroll service providers \u2014 and emphasized the role that payroll\ncompanies play in building and maintaining trust with their clients.\n\nAs a result, he said, the industry will begin to more closely look at the\npayroll business model. Today, that can mean either a payroll processor having\naccess to an employer\u2019s bank accounts to issue funds to employees, or a\npayroll firm managing its own bank account, funded by an employer to pay\nworkers. Regardless of which will win out \u2014 if not both \u2014 Brennan said there\nis an element of trust in the payroll sector that's growing more important as\nservice providers react to a range of shifts, from the need for daily pay to\nadoption of faster payment schemes to accelerate access to wages.\n\nAfter all, Brennan noted, payroll has a direct impact on individuals\u2019\nlivelihoods, and a lackluster or inaccurate payroll experience can have a\nwide-ranging impact, from negatively affecting employee retention, to\npreventing a worker from being able to pay bills.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

automation is driving digital HR transformation across the SMB market)\n\nThe role of HR departments across the globe is rapidly transforming. This is\nbecause the nature of the business environment itself has changed due to the\nadvent of technology and the plethora of digital tools that help boost\nproductivity, as well as altering the way a company operates. And HR\ndepartments suddenly find themselves being the heartbeat of the organizations,\nconnecting all the departments within the company, performing crucial\nfunctions: processing payroll, recruiting talent and perhaps most importantly,\nmanaging the enterprise\u2019s most valuable asset, the human workforce.\n\nIn other words, HR has become a strategic partner to management and is\nresponsible for aligning human capital with the business goals of the company.\nThis new and more integral role, in addition to a traditional role, requires\nutmost efficiency and meticulousness, with very little room for mistake. Which\nis why HR functions in the business need all the help they can get, and,\nthanks to development in the HR tech space, they can now rely on some of the\nmost cutting-edge software and automation tools to help perform their\nfunctions.\n\nThere are many ways in which a properly deployed HR tech solution will benefit\nan HR department, and subsequently improve the productivity and growth of the\nentire organization. Most tools that are currently on the market are designed\nand optimized to not only make life easier for the HR managers and personnel,\nbut they enable more employee engagement. Thus, acquiring an HR tech solution\nshould not be considered an HR-only investment, but a strategic investment to\nimprove the entire organization.\n\n### **Enhancing growth and operational efficiency**\n\n![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/advice-advise-advisor-7075-1024x678.jpg)\n\nOne of the most common features of any HR tech solution is the automated\npayroll function which greatly improves efficiency and reduces costs accrued\nby manual processing. Manual payroll calculations are extremely time-consuming\ngiven the complex remuneration packages that a modern workforce requires. Any\nmanual processing increases the chances of human errors, and can cost big\nmoney! In addition, automating the routine yet crucial functions such as\npayroll processing frees up the human workforce to do more meaningful,\nstrategic functions that enable growth or at least, consolidation.\n\n### **Improved productivity across the board**\n\nHR tech software allows companies to assign, delegate and to closely track the\nattendance, productivity, and performance of staff. Tracking productivity\nallows executives to have their finger on the pulse when it comes to which\nareas need more resources and which do not. With accurate data and insights,\ncompanies could take the guesswork out of the equation and design their\nworkflow based on solid empirical data.\n\nManaging the workforce will be made much easier when there are measurable\nmetrics to go by. Companies could reward high performing employees for their\ncontribution while addressing the needs of and helping staff members that are\nstruggling to meet their goals.\n\n### **Increased employee engagement**\n\nCreating an engaging environment among employees is one of the biggest\nchallenges that companies around the world continue to face, even in the\nmodern era despite all the advanced communication tools to hand. Some HR\nsoftware, however, has made it easier for employees to collaborate and\ncommunicate with each other via the platform by integrating a social media\nelement. An engaged workforce is known to be happier and more productive,\nwhich should be enough of a reason for companies to invest in such platforms.\n\nHowever, with so many options to choose from, picking the right HR solution is\nnot an easy task. Thus, _Tech Wire Asia_ has curated the four most\ncomprehensive HR technology software platforms currently on the market that\nbusinesses should consider, to optimize their HR operations.\n\n## **[GREATDAY HR](https://greatdayhr.com/)**\n\nGreatDay HR is one of the leading mobile-optimized HR tech platforms in in use\nin Southeast Asia which is designed for companies to embrace the mobile-first\ntrend which is taking the enterprise world by storm. The solution, completely\nemployee-focused, is flexible and highly scalable. Smaller and medium sized\nbusiness can acquire GreatDay HR as a standalone solution, while larger\norganizations have the option to deploy it as mobile employee interface for\nthe Sunfish HR SaaS cloud solution (both brands are part of DataOn).\n\n![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/Media-Payroll-1024x449.jpg)\n\nSource: GreatDay HR\n\nWhat makes GreatDay HR stand out from the rest of the pack is that instead of\noffering the mobile feature as an add-on or an afterthought to main platform,\nit is developed from scratch, specifically to cater to the mobile-obsessed\nworld of today\u2019s workforces. This enables employees to seamlessly manage their\nHR data, report attendance, request leave, view their payslips, file for\nreimbursement, ans so forth, all via their mobile phones.\n\nThe platform is geared towards enhancing employee engagement within an\norganization, as the platform is integrated with social media-like features\nenabling better, more meaningful company-wide collaboration, eliminating\nvirtual walls between departments. Other than that, the platform\u2019s Benefit\nfeature enables employees to apply for a loan, or shop for insurance plans via\nthe mobile app, from approved insurance and financial services provider\npartners.\n\nFor a more information on GreatDay\u2019s cutting edge HR solutions and tools,\n[please click here](https://techwireasia.com/2019/05/accelerate-your-digital-\nhr-transformation-on-the-go-with-greatday-hr/).\n\n## **[JUSTLOGIN](https://justlogin.com/)**\n\nSingapore native JustLogin is another HR tech provider that strives to provide\nall-in-one HR solutions which fit the need of SMBs in the Southeast Asia\nregion. With more than 18 years\u2019 experience in helping regional businesses,\nits cloud-based HR application seamlessly integrates with existing systems and\nhardware.\n\n![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/justleave-row4.png)\n\nSource: JustLogin\n\nThe turnkey solution boosts productivity and ensures payroll accuracy and\ncompliance, and eliminates unnecessary paperwork for attendance management.\nTracking employee hours and work performance have never been less complicated,\nas the application allows for one-touch clock-in and clock out. Employees that\nare working remotely could also just clock-in from any mobile device and the\nsystem will capture a photo and location in real-time.\n\nFurthermore, employees will also enjoy a seamless expense claiming process\nwithout the need of tedious messes of receipts and invoices. Staff members can\nscan and upload receipts directly onto the claims application function, and\nthe platform will route the request to the appropriate channel for prompt\napproval and processing.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the JustLogin app could be deployed modularly,\nwhereby companies do not have roll out the entire suite. Having this option is\ncrucial, especially for smaller businesses with limited budget.\n\n## **[PAYROLL2U](https://www.payroll2u.com)**\n\nAnother great HR tech provider that is worth mentioning is Payroll2U. The\ncompany prides itself on having a heavy focus on one thing and doing it really\nwell; payroll. Its platform, smartPay, is an extremely user-friendly cloud-\nbased application that is optimized to increase productivity at all the\ndifferent levels of an organization.

In\naddition, the platform\u2019s Self-Service module empowers managers and employees\nto access, update and manage their own data, eliminating the needless paper\nwork and forms that are traditionally required to do such tasks.

HREasily, an HR solutions company that provides Software as a\nService (SaaS) claims that its products enable businesses to increase\nproductivity by streamlining HR work processes, such as payroll processing,\nleave management and claim applications without breaking the bank.\n\n![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/v5leave_1.png)\n\nSource: HREasily\n\nThe company\u2019s offerings come in different modules that perform different core\nHR tasks, such as payroll, employee data management portal provision, leave\nmanagement, claims processing and attendance tracking.

This not only improves\noperational efficiency but frees up skilled staff to focus their energy on\nmore creative and rewarding tasks, improving employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction. RPA is already doing the heavy lifting in areas including\nprocessing loan applications and insurance claims.\n\nOf course, there is already significant automation in payroll, with very\nadvanced platforms capable of handling hundreds of thousands of complex gross-\nto-net calculations. However, the industry has been slower to adopt automation\ntechnology because decision trees tend to be more complex and, typically, not\nas well documented as in other industries.\n\nThat looks set to change as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\n(ML) technologies become better at helping companies automate ever more\ncomplex processes. We are starting to see the adoption of more sophisticated\nAI and ML systems capable of handling multi-step payroll processes \u00ac\u2013 even\nhelping to drive their simplification.\n\nBut payroll is not just about number crunching. It's about dealing with people\n\u2013 HR personnel, employees, tax authorities and regulators \u2013 professionally,\nsensitively and intelligently. It still needs the human touch. How do\nmultinationals get the most from automation, while handling the diverse, and\noften nuanced, differences in language, regulation, culture and social norms\naround the world?\n\nWe have seen how the traditional shared service centre model has failed to\ndeliver the efficiencies and cost savings expected from consolidating all\npayroll functions into large regional centres \u2013 the 'non-technology' barriers\nproved too difficult to surmount without significantly higher headcount than\nanticipated.\n\nAt TMF Group, we've always recognised the importance of having skilled local\npayroll experts working closely with local employees and tax authorities. Our\nbusiness is founded on the presence of in-house, in-country experts in over 80\njurisdictions. At the same time, this local service is underpinned by a [\nglobal technology\nplatform](/redirection.asp?article_id=869184&company_id=24912&redirectaddress=https://www.tmf-\ngroup.com/en/services/companies/hr-payroll/tmf-horizon/) delivering timely,\naccurate payroll schedules, reports and insights across the whole\norganisation.\n\nSo how should we make best use of advancing automation capabilities? Where and\nhow should we implement the technology to best effect to improve the accuracy\nand performance of payroll systems, while maintaining and improving employee\nsatisfaction and regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions?\n\nOne approach that has been gaining traction over recent years is to separate\npayroll into front- and back-office functions.\n\nSpecialist, front-office tasks and interactions are handled by real people \u2013\nnative speakers who understand local regulations and cultural norms.\n\nLess specialist, back-office functions can be handled by ever more capable\ntechnology, freeing payroll experts to tackle higher-value tasks.\n\nTo derive the most value from automation capabilities, such functions can be\nhandled in hubs in lower-cost locations where geographic borders meet in a\ngiven region. With enough scale to benefit from automation, service delivery\nis carried out with the right mix of native speakers backed by instant access\nto specialist local teams. The commercial benefits of separating transactional\nwork in the hub from specialist in-country activity are clear.\n\nFor payroll, the boundary between specialist front-office functions and\nprocess-driven, back-offices may shift over time but will never disappear. The\nkey will be to adapt the business model to get the most out of payroll\nautomation without losing human expertise.\n\n### Talk to TMF Group\n\nAt TMF Group we make it our business to keep up-to-date with market and\ntechnology changes through our wholly owned local office network.

The service may also have nicer features, such as quality assurance checks.\n  * Before choosing a payroll service, it's important to vet the company by asking for references and speaking with several of its clients.\n\nProcessing payroll is not a task for the faint of heart. It can be daunting,\nwhich is why some business owners outsource the work. But with so many free\nand paid services and apps to choose from, it's challenging to [find the best\npayroll solution for your\nbusiness](https://www.business.com/categories/online-payroll-services/). When\nchoosing between a free payroll service and one you must pay for, keep in mind\nthat an expensive option isn't necessarily better, but free alternatives might\nnot be your best option either.\n\nUnderstanding your business's needs and which payroll features you want are\nkey to choosing the right service. However, if cost is king and you feel like\nyou need a free payroll service, it's important to be aware of what features\nyou'll get and which ones you'll miss out on.\n\n**Editor's note: Need a payroll service for your business? Fill out the below\nquestionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you with free information.**\n\n## What is the difference between a payroll app and a payroll service?\n\nBefore you can decide whether free or paid payroll works for you, you must\nfirst understand the difference between a payroll service and payroll app.\nThis is key to understanding what features they offer. It's easy to lump the\ntwo together, and there are some similarities, but each has its own advantages\nand disadvantages.\n\n### What is a payroll application? ****\n\nA payroll application is just payroll software. It only automates certain\npayroll functions. For example, a payroll application typically allows you to\nset payment processing for employees, calculate wages, implement pay\nschedules, enter data, and file taxes, benefits and retirement information.\nIt's online, so it has the obvious advantage of being accessible from anywhere\nthat has an internet connection.\n\nThe accessibility and convenience of payroll apps gives employers and\nemployees autonomy and flexibility. For instance, if an employee forgets to\nfile a request for paid time off while they're at work, they can take care of\nit on the commute home by connecting to the system on their smartphone.\n\nPayroll apps eliminate the need for a payroll company, processor or any\nservice you use outside of your company to help process your company's\nfinancial information. This helps keep employee information secure and allows\npayroll errors to be handled immediately.\n\nHowever, this freedom can be a double-edged sword, because we're human and\nsometimes forget to fill out a form or enter the wrong numbers.\n\n### What is a payroll service? ****\n\nOn the other hand, payroll services are third-party companies that process\npayroll on your behalf. This takes the load of completing tedious payroll\noperations off of you, saving you time and giving you peace of mind that all\nthe right[forms are filled out](https://www.business.com/articles/payroll-\nforms-guide/) and filed correctly. Payroll services manage all payroll\nprocessing and sometimes human resource functions as well. They also manage\ntax filings, which can be a pain to do yourself.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between payroll software and services is the\ncost. Using a third-party company to manage your business's payroll is not\noften free and usually not cheap. Payroll apps are less expensive because the\nresponsibility to enter data correctly falls on you, and they may not have all\nthe same features as a payroll service.\n\n## What are the benefits of free payroll services and apps?\n\nThe obvious advantage of free payroll services is that you don't have to spend\nany money. When looking for a free service, especially to manage information\nas sensitive as your company's financial data, you need to do your homework.\n\n\"Always ask for a reference and speak with three to five companies that are\ndoing business with them,\" said Rick Fish, a payroll professional certified by\nthe [American Payroll Association](https://www.americanpayroll.org/).\n\nIf you're just starting out, a free payroll service or app can be a good tool\nto use. Any assistance with payroll administration is helpful at this stage,\nfreeing up time for you to focus on other tasks that help you grow your\nbusiness.\n\nFree payroll services or apps have tools that automatically calculate taxes,\nwage garnishments, and Social Security and benefit deductions. This feature\nensures that your company's information is analyzed accurately and that you're\nin compliance with new tax laws, helping you avoid violations and fines.\n\nThis service also offers the choice of [direct deposit\n](https://www.business.com/articles/direct-deposit-services-small-business/)or\npaper checks, tax form generation, and access to[ electronic\npaystubs](https://www.business.com/articles/paystub-generator/). Its\nintegration options allow you to merge other\n[accounting](https://www.business.com/categories/accounting-software/) or\nbusiness software with your payroll, which means you don't have to worry about\nkeeping two separate systems in sync.\n\n## What may be missing from free payroll services and apps?\n\nWhile saving money is great, you should be prepared to sacrifice a few things\nwhen using a free payroll service, said Alexia Matak, sales and marketing\ndirector of [Payroll Experts](https://www.payrollexperts.com/). A free option\ntypically gives you just the basic features, so free payroll may not have\neverything you want or need for your company.\n\n### Customer support\n\nOne feature that free services don't often include is customer support.\n\n\"If you are fine with having more of a '1-800' call center atmosphere and you\ncould forgo the local presence of a dedicated point of contact, then you'll be\nOK,\" Matak said.\n\nPersonable customer service may seem like something you can do without if you\nfeel confident using the payroll app, but let's say you make a mistake or\nenter information incorrectly. If you aren't a paying customer, the service\nprovider may not step in to help you resolve the issue as quickly as you would\nlike.\n\nThe use of free payroll services may compromise the accuracy and punctuality\nof your payroll tax filing as well. According to the Internal Revenue Service,\n[40% of small businesses ](http://www.vision-hr.com/news/benefits-of-\noutsourcing-payroll/)are hit with fines that average $845 a year for incorrect\npayroll tax filings. Do not be a statistic! To avoid this problem, make sure\nyou know who is responsible for filing your taxes. Matak encourages business\nowners to ask questions and be wary of payroll service companies that require\nyou to enter your employees' wage information yourself. You should look for a\ncompany that handles that task for you.\n\n### Security\n\nIf you're interested in a free payroll service, you may also have to\ncompromise on your security. While payroll companies that charge for their\nservices invest money and resources into multiple servers and data security\nsystems, free payroll software may be glitchy and may not be secure against\ndata breaches and online hackers.\n\nAlso, while full-service systems typically back up the system for you\nautomatically, a free payroll service may require you to do a bit more work to\nkeep your data secure, so you may have to back it up yourself. Each pay period\ncreates a cascade of payroll information that you are legally obligated to\nkeep for a certain amount of time, and losing it to computer failure would be\ndisastrous.\n\n### Quality assurance checks\n\nWithholding errors are also common. Some systems aren't advanced or efficient\nenough to tell the difference between regular and additional voluntary\nwithholding amounts. You can find these safeguards and system checks in paid\nservices, with alerts and accuracy assurance consultants who review your\ninformation for errors. Glitches can lead to fines for under-withholding, and\nother costly blunders like overpaying and underpaying employees can also lead\nto angry staff. Reporting of paid time off and sick days may also be affected.\n\n## What are the benefits of paying for payroll services and apps?\n\nA staple rule of buying something is that you get what you pay for. Payroll\nfeatures vary, and you may discover options you didn't know you needed.\nSometimes paying for services comes with the benefit of more features to\nchoose from. This gives you the flexibility to customize the service, because\nthe base plan isn't your only option. In some cases, this can even save you\nmoney.\n\n### Payroll protection\n\nPaying for higher security is a smart investment to protect your company's\nsensitive information. When you use payroll software, your information is\naccessible to anyone with access to the online platform. This can lead to\ntheft or embezzlement. Paying for a software or service with encryption\ntechnology and routine data backups will save you headaches and likely keep\nyour company from falling victim to fraud and financial harm. Some payroll\ncompanies don't charge for this service, while others make it very expensive.\n\n### Streamlined service\n\nIn addition to heightened security, paying for services can provide access to\nfunctions that make your payroll processing experience even easier. Additional\nfeatures include contract generation, contractor services, labor law\ncompliance, access to health benefits, workers' compensation payments and\nbookkeeping services. Depending on your type of business, some of these\nservices may be just what you need.\n\n### Lower costs than for in-house HR\n\nDepending on your company's size and complexity, a payroll processing service\nmay replace your need to hire a human resource specialist. Instead of hiring\nanother employee and paying their salary and benefits, you would simply pay\nthe payroll company for its services, which is likely much less expensive.\n\n## What are the common issues of paying for payroll services and apps?\n\nJust as you'd create a shopping list to keep you grounded in the grocery\nstore, make one for the features you need and want for your payroll\noperations. Nothing is worse than realizing after several months of paying for\na service that you were tricked into buying a bunch of bells and whistles\nyou've never even used.\n\nSome payroll services bundle their features into preconfigured plans, so\nsometimes you end up paying for amenities you don't need. It's important to\nlook through each payroll service's plans closely to see exactly what each one\noffers. All-inclusive deals can be cost-effective, but not when they include a\nlot of features that are not useful for your kind of business.\n\nSome companies may charge you for pay frequency, which is how often you pay\nyour employees. Other companies charge a monthly base fee regardless of how\nmany times you pay your employees, but you should double-check this.\n\nPayroll service expenses can increase quickly if you're not careful. Some\ncompanies may charge an extra fee for tax assistance because they don't\nprovide payroll tax operations off the bat, hitting you with an expensive\nsurprise at the end of the year.\n\nSurprise fees for check signing, paper check printing, envelope stuffing,\ndirect deposit and new employee reporting can also sneak into your bill. With\nany service, stepping outside of your set features can lead to additional\ncosts. To avoid extra charges, think about features you may not know you are\nusing, like payroll adjustment services.\n\n## How do you look for a good payroll service or application?\n\nWhether you are looking for a free or paid [payroll\nservice](https://www.business.com/articles/how-to-do-payroll/) or application,\ndependability should be the first thing you look for. Here are a few\nadditional factors you should consider to determine if your payroll service is\na quality choice.\n\nFirst, when picking a payroll service \u2013 whether it's free or paid \u2013 do your\nresearch. Ask questions, ask for references, check online reviews, and call\nthe company's customer support line. Take advantage of a free trial if one is\navailable so you can see if the payroll app is easy to use and has the\nfeatures you need.\n\nMake sure the service or application you choose will pay your employees and\npayroll taxes on time. The last thing you want is to be fined because your\nsoftware is glitchy or your payroll service missed a deadline. Find out if\nyour payroll service has an online portal that you can check to see whether\nthe data you entered is what is getting processed. It is also important to\nunderstand who is liable if a mistake is made and how long it takes to address\nan error.

sustainability of any SMB hinges on on-time wages and complaint payroll\nprocesses. We look at how automation could make this extremely simple,\naddressing common objections around automating payroll in SMBs._**\n\nPayroll has always been an extremely time-consuming task, no matter the size\nof your workforce. Studies estimate that small business owners spend _[over\nten hours](https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/the-burden-of-accounting-\nand-taxes-on-small-business)_ every month simply processing their employee\npayroll. Now, payroll automation could unlock significant efficiencies for\nsmall-to-mid-sized business. At this scale, organizations are primarily\nfocused on growth, product quality, and new business areas. Routine tasks like\npayroll could place immense pressures (especially at month end) distracting\nfrom the actual work at hand. With most tasks around payroll essentially\niterative and formulaic, there\u2019s no reason why SMBs should hesitate to adopt\npayroll automation.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nYet, recent reports prove that automation in HR is still lagging. A survey by\nCareerBuilder found that only _[37% of HR services are\nautomated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/11/16/five-\ntips-for-introducing-intelligent-automation-to-hr/)_.\n\n\u201cEvery year, approximately 40 percent of small businesses pay penalties or\nfines for late or incorrect payroll filings, mainly because they are doing\nthem by hand,\u201d explains Rick Chen, Communication Lead at payroll solutions\nexpert [Gusto](https://gusto.com/). Here\u2019s a quick glance at the top three\nreasons why payroll automation for SMBs is yet to take off.\n\nAlso read: _[10 Common Payroll Myths\nBusted](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/10-common-payroll-myths-for-smbs-busted/)_\n\n## Three Obstacles you\u2019re Probably Facing when Automating Payroll\n\n  * **Dedicating the staff and budgets required**  \nSmall businesses often lack a full-scale HR team and there might not be a\nstakeholder available to take complete ownership of the automated system. On\ntop of that, finding the requisite funds for payroll automation, in addition\nto other initiatives that probably stand higher on your priority list can be a\nchallenge.  \nThe answer to this is the emerging crop of standalone, ready-to-deploy payroll\ntools, delivered via pay-as-you-go SaaS models. A number of these come with\nextensive support, and Managed Services requiring minimal intervention at your\nend. \u201cThe most advanced technology many small businesses use to run payroll is\noften a calculator. Full-service payroll services like Gusto can help small\nbusiness owners avoid fines and save time,\u201d says Rick.\n\n  * **Overcoming initial employee resistance**  \nIn an SMB scenario, even a small group of employees resisting transformation\ncan be a major hurdle. It\u2019s important to note that as your business grows,\ndoing payroll completely manually will no longer remain an option. By having\nintimate discussions with your employees and explaining the criticality of\npayroll automation, you could ease adoption and boost acceptance rates.\n\n  * **Addressing fears around job security**  \nFast growing, mid-sized businesses could choose to automate payroll and\nredirect those efforts elsewhere. While this is perfectly reasonable your HR\nteam could be concerned about their refreshed role in an automation-first\nworkplace.  \nIn reality, executives spend around _[16\nhours](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-\nus/doc-type/resource-center/infographic/infographic-state-of-work-2017.pdf)_\nevery week on manual tasks like updating spreadsheets or filling out forms.\nIt\u2019s vital that HR teams understand that payroll automation is a time-saving\naid and not a job replacement.  \nThese are the three elements to be first addressed, before implementing\npayroll automation for SMBs. Once these basic change management measures are\nin place, you can look at available options to introduce automation.\n\n##  \nIdeas for Payroll Automation: Old School, On-Premise, or Cloud\n\nSurprisingly, a powerful spreadsheet software can often prove to be a viable\nautomation tool. If correctly configured via formulas, filters, and third-\nparty integrations, they could actually reduce some of the manual efforts\ninvolved in payroll processing. At the very least, spreadsheet-based\nrudimentary automation does away with a lot of the paperwork you\u2019re probably\nfacing as an SMB.\n\n**Also read: _[A Call to Put down Paper and Get\nDigital](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/a-call-to-put-down-paper-and-get-digital/)_**\n\nThis, however, is not a sustainable model. Not only does it rely on manual\nintervention at some level, as your business grows (bringing in foreign\nworkers, freelancers, and seasonal employees) the number of complexities will\nrise exponentially. That\u2019s why modern organizations choose to either build a\npayroll automation platform from scratch or purchase a right fit solution\nthrough licensing/SaaS frameworks.\n\nBuilding in-house has a few obvious advantages. It\u2019s highly secure, perfectly\naligned to your business needs, and issues can be fixed without any external\nsupport. However, unless you have the requisite technical expertise in place,\nfrom scratch development can be extremely cost intensive. Not only that,\nstorage and processing will further strain your IT infrastructure.\n\nThat\u2019s why we recommend a ready-to-deploy payroll automation tool, that\u2019s both\nturnkey as well as customizable in-line with your need/preferences. Through\nbuy-in of digital capabilities, you can receive regular updates, stay on top\nof payroll compliance laws, and gain access to highly experienced payroll\nautomation experts -- free of any additional investments.\n\n## A Quick Checklist for Getting Started\n\n\u201cMany payroll services now integrate employee benefits such as health\ninsurance, 401(k) retirement plans and other employee benefits. A payroll\nprovider may be the best option for a small business as they can process any\nnecessary deductions automatically when payroll is run and eliminate\nrepetitive data entry,\u201d notes Rick. After you\u2019ve zeroed in on the ideal\npayroll automation solution for your SMB, we suggest a few best practices.\n\n  * **Start with a free trial.** This will give you a hands-on understanding of how the solution works.\n  * **Input your business tax information and your bank account**. Once the data is fed into the system, there\u2019ll be no duplication in the long run.\n  * **Choose your pay period**. Most robust solutions will have flexible payment schedules so you can easily accommodate monthly/weekly/hourly workers. \u201cGusto recently launched Flexible Pay, which allows employees on-demand access to funds without having to wait until payday, for little or no cost,\u201d Rick highlights.\n  * **Purchase workers compensation insurance**. While requirements may vary from state to state, this is must-have when starting your payroll automation journey. \n\n  \n**Also read: _[5 Critical Factors to Consider for Evaluating Payroll\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/5-critical-factors-to-consider-for-evaluating-payroll-\ntechnology/)_**\n\n## Why SMBs Need Payroll Automation, Today\n\nYour employees are the biggest asset of any business, especially in the\nstarting years. You cannot afford to negatively impact loyalty, or ESAT rates\ndue to payment delays, or inadequate compliance. Manually filling out the\nreams of paperwork involved increases the risk of errors, besides wasting your\nprecious time. Any breach opens your business to legal ramifications, curbing\nyour fast-paced growth curve.\n\n\u201cQualified small businesses could claim up to $250,000 per fiscal year through\nthe Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research\nActivities beginning in 2017. In one year, Gusto helped 1,000 U.S. small\nbusinesses claim more than $32.5 million through this federal R&D; tax credit\nin real time,\u201d Rick adds. Given all of these factors, in addition to the\ntangible time & effort efficiencies, payroll automation is the way forward for\nany enlightened SMB.\n\n[

a\nhighly competitive, candidate-centric job market. We share the top ten trends\nevery payroll manager must keep in mind, in order to make a genuine difference\nin 2019._**\n\nWith unemployment levels plummeting and the skills gap widening, employers\nmust go the extra mile to attract top talent and ensure that they stay on with\nthe company. Before perks and engagement plans, streamlining payroll is\nessential for employers, regardless of industry or size. That\u2019s why we are\nwitnessing a flood of new technologies which aim to transform payroll\nmanagement in 2019. Not only will it make HR managers\u2019 lives easier, reducing\nmanual efforts at month-end, it will also position digitalized payroll as a\nvalue add to retain high-performing employees. Here are ten payroll management\ntrends we can expect to mature this year.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n_**Also read:[From our Archives - Compensation Trends Companies Must\nIncorporate](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/compensation-trends-companies-must-incorporate/)**_\n\n  1. **Automated Payroll will be Entirely GDPR-friendly** \\- Payroll automation is founded on the idea that employee data is seamlessly available across locations and interfaces. The GDPR went into effect in the middle of last year; any new payroll management solution being introduced to the market will now be GDPR-compliant.  \n\n  2. **Payroll will be Audit-ready from Day One** \\- Instead of scrambling at quarter-end or year-end to collate and reconcile payroll information, employers will adopt automated report generation that allows electronic submission, without any complex bureaucratic formalities.  \n\n  3. **Gig Workers will Enter your Payroll** \\- The distinction between pay rolled employees and third-party workers will start to fade as companies increasingly rely on gig workers. This goes beyond blue collar jobs, encompassing high-value projects led by experienced consultants and the enlightened \u2018digital nomad\u2019.  \n\n  4. **Bots will Guide Query Resolution** \\- Employees running from one department to the other, trying to get queries answered from HR, finance, or even accounts, is a familiar picture to us all. In 2019 AI-based chatbots (deployed as standalone apps or part of a larger employee service suite) will be a common answer to this problem.  \n\n  5. **Manual Payroll will Finally become Obsolete** \\- With payroll automation finally becoming extremely cost-effective as well as easy-to-deploy, a larger number of small businesses will abandon manual, paper-driven processes. This will be driven by increasing familiarity with tech and a boom in the payroll solutions market.  \n\n_**Also read:[How to Automate Payroll for SMBs: A Complete\nGuide](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-to-\nautomate-payroll-for-smbs-a-complete-guide/)**_\n\n  1. **Weekly or Monthly payroll won\u2019t be the Only Way** \\- Some solutions have already started rolling out flexible payroll systems that align wages to a specific date every month or even support one-time payments as part of a company\u2019s regularized disbursal cycle. Interestingly, this is perfectly in-line with gig worker requirements.  \n  \n\u201cPayroll companies like Gusto are increasingly offering alternatives to bi-\nweekly or monthly pay periods. For example, Gusto recently launched Flexible\nPay, which allows employees on-demand access to funds without having to wait\nuntil payday, for little or no cost,\u201d said Rick Chen, Communications Lead at\n_[Gusto](https://gusto.com/)_.  \n\n  2. **Unbanked Employees will be Welcomed** \\- Contrary to popular belief, a huge portion of the global population remains unbanked, even in developed economies. Platforms like Gusto will help bring this workforce segment into the payroll management ambit, easing access to the salaries they have rightfully earned.   \n\n_**Also read:[WiseWage and SOLE Financials Join Hands to Serve the Unbanked\nWorkforce](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/payroll-\nadministration/wisewage-and-sole-financials-join-hands-to-serve-the-unbanked-\nworkforce/)**_\n\n  1. **Disbursal will be Instantaneous** \\- Taking off from the widespread popularity of mobile payment applications, payroll management will also explore instant payment options, so that workers do not have to wait for a certain period after their shift/project/seasonal tenue with a company has ended.  \n\n  2. **Financial Wellness will be Part of the Package** \\- By advocating the need for financial wellness, employers can make sure their workforce is equipped to maintain a certain quality of life and correctly utilize their allocated wages. In 2019, financial wellness benefits will be a way to drive employee satisfaction without constant pay hikes.  \n\n  3. **Pay Transparency will be the Norm Everywhere** \\- From ensuring that salary and wage levels are kept private, progressive employers will look at sharing salary levels publicly \u2013 from white-collar ranks to part-time workers. This will go a long way in reinforcing employer brand, communicating the values of fair pay and equality.\n\n_**Also read:[5 Critical Factors to Consider for Evaluating Payroll\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/5-critical-factors-to-consider-for-evaluating-payroll-\ntechnology/) **_\n\nThese are the top ten payroll management trends we expect to witness over the\nnext few months.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/payroll-automation-blamed-\naustralia-underpayment-scandals-wage-theft/) __\n\nA string of underpayment cases that have emerged across Australia in recent\nmonths is raising concerns over corporates\u2019 reliance on automated payroll and\naccounting platforms, the[Sydney Morning\nHerald](https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/rise-of-the-machines-\nis-trust-in-payroll-software-disastrous-20191115-p53ay5.html) reported\nThursday (Dec. 26).\n\nPointing to a recent case at hardware chain Bunnings, which last month\n[admitted](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/bunnings-reveals-\nunderpayment-bill-of-6-1-million-20191129-p53fa4.html) to $4.24 million in\nunderpayments to 40,000 current and former employees, the publication said\npossible over-reliance on payroll technology is increasing the risk of\nunderpaying employees.\n\n\u201cWhen you read the fine print, [payroll\nsolutions](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/salarium-payroll-\nexperience-fraud-errors/) are really good at dispersing money,\u201d said Ben\nRenshaw, partner in charge of people advisory, employment and expatriate\ntaxation at advisory firm BDO, in an interview with the publication. \u201cThey\u2019re\nquite good at doing the tax calculations. What they\u2019re entirely useless at is\nknowing what to pay people.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, analysts are warning that corporates could be relying\ntoo much on automated payroll technologies that use outdated or incorrect data\nfed into systems by untrained employees.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is a high level of trust in payroll solutions that thinks they\nwill fix the problems,\u201d added Renshaw. \u201cI think this has been aided and\nabetted by payroll providers, because that sounds really good.\u201d\n\nHe warned that Australian businesses investing in these platforms are failing\nto also use experts trained to ensure that data inputs are accurate to\nguarantee correct compensation is paid.\n\nAustralia recently launched a wage theft inquiry after a spat of allegations\nof wage theft and underpayment this year.

Hotels and eateries, however, will need to wait to the\nmiddle of May at the soonest. The country was widely closed three weeks prior,\nwith restaurants and schools, among other venues, shuttered.\n\nAnd, after a staffer had a positive test result for the coronavirus,\n[Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/) has said that it will halt live classes\nup to April 30, [The\nVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209562/peloton-stop-live-classes-\ncoronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-employee) reported.

The judge supervising the case inked an\norder approving the request. Lenders have been hesitant to make retailers file\nfor bankruptcy as stores can\u2019t have liquidation sales during the pandemic, and\nthe ruling is important as tenants are expected to make on-time rent payments\neven in bankruptcy.\n\nOn another note, self-driving company [Zoox](https://zoox.com/) laid off\nnearly its entire force of contract workers last week, including its backup\ndrivers, [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21210000/zoox-layoff-\ncoronavirus-self-driving-car-safety-drivers) reported.

Amazon, for its part, has mandated\nthat workers at facilities throughout the nation remain 6 feet away from each\nother to restrict the coronavirus\u2019 spread.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

management, integrity improves, along with\nstandardization, transparency and ultimately, process design.\n\nBy: [Paul Bartlett](https://hrexecutive.com/author/paul-bartlett/ \"Posts by\nPaul Bartlett\") | February 10, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/GettyImagesAutomation700-700x450.jpg)\n\nExecutives around the world are looking for continuous process improvements\nand new ways to enhance organizational effectiveness. It\u2019s an evergreen topic\nand one that deserves ongoing consideration and attention. Markets fluctuate,\ncompetitive pressures necessitate constant change and business goals evolve.\nPerhaps nowhere is this more apparent than within human resources, a critical\ncorporate function constantly challenged with demonstrating its value and\nmeasuring what matters. Factor in global presence and the imperative grows\neven taller, as HR teams seek to orchestrate their activities across time\nzones, language barriers and local labor laws. All the while, payroll tackles\nsimilar challenges, working diligently to satisfy country-specific\nrequirements and ensure employees get paid accurately and on-time. Two\nseemingly separate needs, both handling workforce information day in and day\nout, maintaining and updating records, managing requests, and ultimately,\npromoting a positive employee experience across the board.\n\nDepending on the project, HR and payroll spend an excessive number of hours\ncoordinating data collection and verification, making adjustments,\ncalculations and transferring information as needed. Even organizations in the\nU.S. with enterprise solutions in place, struggle to automate across global\nlocations, relying instead on manual updates and spreadsheets and resulting in\nmore mistakes and higher costs back to the employer. Historically, it seemed\nimpossible to share workflows, and as a result, the HR and payroll landscape\nbecame increasingly fractured and decentralized, unable to bridge the divide \u2013\nuntil recently.\n\n**Revisiting product**\n\nToday, advanced technologies allow for the movement of data around the globe\nthrough automation across the cloud. With the shift towards digital\ntransformation, comes the opportunity to simplify and streamline systems\nthrough integration \u2013 but change happens slowly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s\n[Payroll Operations Survey from\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/payroll-operations-survey.html), which showed only 6% of\ncompanies use robotics as part of their processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere remains an amazing amount of information available that no one ever\nthought to get from the other, and a unified, automated approach between HR\nand payroll makes it possible to review and refresh what already exists while\ngathering anything missing. At the same time, recent regulations, such as\nGDPR, put new guidelines and restrictions in place, reinforcing the need for a\nfresh look. From a data security perspective, integrations enable teams to\nmonitor the access to and movement of data from a single source, as opposed to\nmany. In the case of one multinational financial services company, integration\nand automated workflows reduced reliance on manual interventions, improved\nreporting, and maintained compliance that meets regional standards while\nproviding significant process improvements.\n\nWith a global, unified platform, people and processes work collectively,\nmanaging both the day-to-day and unexpected tasks in real-time. Shared\nworkflows open up collaboration and communication, regardless of location,\nremoving the guesswork for scheduling and using built-in functionality for\nreporting and validations. Once the current workload becomes integrated and\nautomated, incremental activities get built on top of that base, contributing\nto improved efficiency and outcomes.\n\n**Unifying people**\n\nThere is no doubt that technology serves as the core of any integration, in\nthis instance, with the tools and automation embedded on a global basis,\nrather than country by country. But there is another critical factor to\nconsider in achieving these workflows because beyond the immediate\nstakeholders is the impact of HR and payroll have on the employee experience.\nFreeing up the tedium associated with disparate systems, HR and payroll\nprofessionals offload the process-heavy tasks and focus more on meaningful\ninitiatives \u2013 reinvigorating their roles and responsibilities and bringing\ninspiration and innovation to the organization.\n\nFor the multinational mentioned above, integration worked to centralize\npayroll data across jurisdictions, adding authorization and validation online\nwhile eliminating the need for different providers, forms, and documentation.\nAs a result of simplification and automation, the teams introduced online\npayslips and offered employees the opportunity to use self-service tools to\nmaintain personal data.\n\nWithout the stress of each country\u2019s run deadlines and the looming threat of\nerrors, payroll can build out and introduce new options like payroll cash\nadvances to help employees in between paychecks. On the HR side, having access\nto [global payroll](https://www.cloudpay.net/) data boosts visibility across\nthe workforce and supports internal recruitment and talent mobility programs \u2013\nat a time when [PwC sees a 50% increase in international\nassignments](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-\nwork/pdf/talent-mobility-2020.pdf) on the horizon. Through integration, the\ncapabilities of HR and payroll expand, linking the two with employer brand\nmanagement while workers benefit as well, signaling a win-win for the\norganization.\n\n**Harmonizing process**\n\nOf course, as executives know all too well, there is always new and more work\nto do. What serves the organization today may not tomorrow, and HR and payroll\nneed to remain agile. [Deloitte refers to this mindset as\n\u201charmonizing\u201d](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/mergers-\nacqisitions/us-ma-using-integration-to-catalyze-hr-transformation.pdf) rather\nthan the more frequently used \u201coptimizing,\u201d noting that \u201cA transformative\nintegration \u2026 may identify opportunities to more efficiently deliver HR\nservices, including technology-enabled improvements and process redesign.\u201d\nHaving already touched upon improvements to service delivery, the focus shifts\nto process, which underpins the success of the product and the people involved\nwith HR and payroll.\n\nOften, through a series of workflows engines or mapping, metadata about the\nprocess gets captured, indicating where inefficiencies take place and offering\na clear line of sight into potential improvements. An instance of this\nhappening might involve first-time approval rates and the effectiveness of\nmoving HR data into the payroll process. By analyzing the success of the task,\nHR and payroll learn about the accuracy of existing data as well as anything\nmissing that would be required for future runs. No surprise that same\nmultinational now sees a payroll accuracy rate of 99.99% while bringing cost\nsavings across functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs this practice progresses, with HR and payroll updating and automating as\nneeded, the organization gains more profound insights into the overall\nefficiency of its integrations and shared workflows. Through better data\nmanagement, integrity improves, along with standardization, transparency and\nultimately, process design, leading HR and payroll teams to harmonious,\nproductive co-habitation.\n\nThe HR and payroll markets continue to innovate and enhance all aspects of\nworkforce management, and with that, so must global employers. The rapid\nadvancement of automation, integration and workflows correspond directly with\nan organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and adopt quickly in the future. Like the\nemployee experience, digital transformation never stops, and the ability to\nintegrate HR and payroll offers global organizations the chance to evolve with\nworkforce needs in near real-time, positively impacting their product, process\nand people.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Shaping+HR+effectiveness+through+shared+workflows&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Despite marijuana being legal in many states,\ncannabis businesses are still on shaky ground at the federal level, and banks\nin particular are skittish about partnering with the industry. Without solid\nbanking partners, local cannabis businesses can have trouble keeping up on\npayroll. So what\u2019s the solution?\n\nRather than waiting for Congress to make a decision on [potential\nregulations](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-\nbill/1595/titles) that would shield banks from federal punishment for\nmaintaining accounts for cannabis businesses, more dispensaries and growers\nare moving toward using web-based cannabis payroll platforms designed\nspecifically for their industry.\n\nHere are five examples of payroll platforms that dispensaries and growers can\nuse.\n\n**1.**[ **Wurk**](https://www.enjoywurk.com/)  \nWurk has developed cannabis software for payroll and human resources. The\ncompany\u2019s relationship with banks and financial institutions allows it to\noffer payroll services to all verticals within the cannabis industry,\nincluding those that have not had access to payroll management systems\npreviously. Through Wurk\u2019s web-based platform, businesses have access to\nautomated payroll software that syncs general ledger processing and\nelectronically files federal, state, and local taxes. Wurk can handle direct\ndeposits, it generates pay stubs, it tracks pay histories for employees, and\nit handles tax filings to maximize deductions. In addition to payroll, the\nWurk platform can also be setup to manage hiring, HR, scheduling, and time\nkeeping.\n\n**2.[PeopleGuru](https://www.peopleguru.com/)**  \nPeopleGuru is a cannabis-friendly payroll platform. Residing on a single\ndatabase, PeopleGuru\u2019s product suite includes tools for payroll and taxes,\nbenefits management, salary administration, and compliance management.\nBusinesses can streamline their operations by adopting PeopleGuru\u2019s paperless\nworkflow. More importantly to cannabis businesses, PeopleGuru offers a long-\nterm payroll banking solution. With Private Banking Services, cannabis\nbusinesses can get secure ACH files for direct deposit and check printing and\ndistribution services, with the ability to maintain existing bank\nrelationships.\n\n**3.[Greenleaf](https://www.greenleaf-hr.com/)**  \nGreenleaf\u2019s payroll services and human resources consulting platform helps to\nkeep dispensaries and other marijuana businesses compliant with state and\nfederal regulations. Greenleaf\u2019s all-in-one system covers HR, payroll, taxes,\nand employee benefits. Businesses can view deduction registers, invoice\nhistories, payroll registers, and summary reports through the web-based\nsystem. Greenleaf also handles paid-time-off (PTO) accrual for employees and\nW2 management.\n\n**4.[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/)**  \nZenefits specializes in human capital management, or HCM. The company\u2019s web-\nbased platform includes tools for payroll, HR, benefits, and scheduling.\nAlthough Zenefits isn\u2019t targeted exclusively at the cannabis market, it does\nwork with a number of clients in the industry and the company partners with\nParagon Payroll to accommodate its cannabis customers' payroll needs.\nZenefits\u2019 payroll platform is fully integrated, with advanced features like\nautomatic salary changes, benefits deductions syncing, and automatically\nprorated payments for new hires. Zenefits\u2019 automatic compliance tools and\nautomatic federal and state tax filings are also useful for entrepreneurs in\nthe cannabis industry.\n\n**5.[AdaptiveHR](https://www.adaptivehr.net/)**  \nAdaptiveHR boasts extensive cannabis industry expertise, which the company has\ntapped in the design of a web-based payroll processing center. Businesses in\nthe cannabis industry can use AdaptiveHR\u2019s platform to setup their human\nresources departments, benefits programs, and retirement programs. They can\nalso use the platform\u2019s payroll processing tools to ensure accurate and\ncompliant payments go out to their employees on time each month. AdaptiveHR\nsupports both standard payroll and PEO payroll, which means the risk of having\nemployees is shared between the client\u2019s company and AdaptiveHR.\n\n_[Stephanie Miles](mailto:stephanie@streetfightmag.com) is a senior editor at\nStreet Fight.[![Rainbow over Montclair](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Rainbow-over-\nMontclair.bmp)](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/Rainbow-\nover-Montclair.bmp)_\n\nTags: [AdaptiveHR](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/adaptivehr/)\n[Cannabis](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/cannabis/)\n[Greenleaf](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/greenleaf/)\n[homepage](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/homepage/)\n[marijuana](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/marijuana/)\n[PeopleGuru](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/peopleguru/)\n[Wurk](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/wurk/)\n[Zenefits](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/zenefits/)\n\n![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/Uber-\nApp-e1426675495814-600x200.png)\n\nPrevious Post\n\n[](https://streetfightmag.com/2019/09/12/uber-pledges-to-fight-california-\ncontractor-bill/)\n\n#### [Uber Pledges to Fight California Contractor\nBill](https://streetfightmag.com/2019/09/12/uber-pledges-to-fight-california-\ncontractor-bill/)\n\nSeptember 12, 2019\n\n![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/Google-Maps-AR-\nmode-600x200.png)\n\nNext Post\n\n[](https://streetfightmag.com/2019/09/11/is-visual-mapping-the-next-google-\napple-battleground/)\n\n#### [Is Visual Mapping the Next Google-Apple\nBattleground?](https://streetfightmag.com/2019/09/11/is-visual-mapping-the-\nnext-google-apple-battleground/)\n\nSeptember 12, 2019\n\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/Street-Fight-\nSubscribe.png)](https://streetfightmag.us2.list-\nmanage.com/subscribe?u=f993b7288a6ff252fae2af2c7&id=c0d1b13c61)\n\n## Street Fight's Big 3\n\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Google.jpg)](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/google/)\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Facebook.jpg)](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/facebook/)\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Amazon.jpg)](https://streetfightmag.com/tag/amazon)\n\n## Street Fight Columns\n\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/street-\nBytes.png)](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/street-bytes-\ncolumn/) [![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-content/uploads/streets-\nahead.png)](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/streets-ahead/)\n[![](https://cfcdn.streetfightmag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/roadmap.png)](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/road-\nmap/)\n\n## Categories\n\nCase Studies [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/case-studies-2/)\n\nCommentary [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/)\n\nHeard on the Street Podcast [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/heard-on-\nthe-street-podcast/)\n\nNews & Analysis [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/news/)\n\nRoad Map (column) [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/road-map/)\n\nSponsored Content [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/sponsored-content/)\n\nStreet Bytes (column)\n[](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/street-bytes-column/)\n\nStreet Fight Happenings [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/street-fight-\nhappenings/)\n\nStreets Ahead (column)\n[](https://streetfightmag.com/category/commentary/streets-ahead/)\n\nTheme of the Month [](https://streetfightmag.com/category/street-fight-\nspotlight/)\n\nSubscribe to Street Fight Daily\n\nWake Up to the Latest in Location Tech\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nDon't Worry.

The falling out of the deal is\nexpected to cause backlash. Former WeWork CEO [Adam\nNeumann](https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2019/wework-neumann-to-relinquish-\nceo-role/), ejected from his role last year when the board decided he couldn't\ncomplete his duties properly, is expected to sue.\n\nBut SoftBank will still do its part in the form of a $5 billion assistance to\nhelp with syndicated debt payments, sources close to the situation told [Yahoo\nFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pulls-the-plug-on-we-work-\nbailout-giving-founder-adam-neumann-another-black-eye-214758844.html).\n\nSoftBank agreed to bail out WeWork last September amid the latter company's\nfiscal free-fall after a botched [initial public\noffering](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2019/wework-officially-shelves-ipo/)\n(IPO). The end result would've boosted WeWork and early backers of the\ncompany, such as Benchmark Capital.\n\nHowever, SoftBank has been busy in recent weeks, working to raise $10 billion\nfor its [Vision Fund](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-\ntracker/2020/softbank-raise-10-billion-bolster-vision-fund/) to help combat\nthe coronavirus pandemic that has disrupted the world's economy. This process\nhas been difficult due to some of that very same chaos, with oil prices\nfalling and causing strife among Middle Eastern investors, and many companies\nsaying they'll have trouble surviving. The virus has sent markets plummeting\nand displaced workers in almost every industry.\n\nAmid everything going on, [reports](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-\ntracker/2020/wework-softbank-hold-up-your-end-deal/) came out last month that\nSoftBank was looking for an exit on the buying of stock in WeWork, in spite of\nnow owning 80 percent of the company and having made its own operating chief,\nMarcelo Claure, the executive chair for WeWork.\n\nOf all the participants in the now-defunct deal, Neumann has perhaps the\nbiggest proverbial egg on his face, as he was waiting to draw in $1 billion in\nstocks connected to SoftBank, Yahoo Finance reported. That was not a fact\nreceived well among employees and investors whose stock options are now\nworthless because of Neumann's mistakes, which led to WeWork's chaos in the\nfirst place.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/how-apis-the-gig-economy-drive-\npayroll-accounting-connectivity/) __\n\nWith open banking business models inspiring FinTech innovators to explore\nother use cases for data integrations, the B2B financial services market has\nseen a swath of collaboration between traditional financial institutions and\nFinTech firms \u2014 and between FinTech firms themselves. Though not a new\ntechnology, application programming interfaces (APIs) are having a moment in\nthe spotlight, thanks to open banking initiatives and their ability to break\ndown data silos in the back office.\n\nDriven by the embrace of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms, corporates\nnow have a greater opportunity than ever to take advantage of data\nconnectivity, and operate their various finance functions in harmony. It\u2019s a\nlogical progression for financial management, but not without its hurdles,\nsaid Mark Mathews, vice president and head of product development at time-\ntracking technology company\n[OnTheClock](https://www.ontheclock.com/default.aspx?referrer=pymntspro).\n\nThe company recently\n[launched](https://www.prweb.com/releases/ontheclock_makes_it_faster_and_easier_for_accountants_to_access_time_data_for_payroll/prweb16704974.htm)\na new function in its time clock platform, connecting accountants and payroll\nproviders to employee time-tracking data to prevent manual and double data\nentry. Payroll and accounting are \u201ccodependent functions,\u201d Mathews recently\ntold PYMNTS.\n\nIndeed, payroll is among several financial functions that stand to gain from\ngetting closer to accounting. After all, any money coming in or out of a\nbusiness must be recorded, reported on and analyzed. Accounting and enterprise\nresource planning (ERP) platforms are, therefore, a natural fit to consolidate\nthat information, and properly reconcile wage payouts.\n\nIncreasingly, Mathews said, businesses are adopting accounting platforms and\npayroll technologies that can integrate with each other. However, today\u2019s\ncurrent climate means achieving that data is not always an easy feat.\n\n\u201cIn the real world, we see a mixture of integrated versus non-integrated\npayroll software,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor example, a large percentage of employers\nmaintain their books internally, and outsource their payroll to a third\nparty.\u201d\n\nThis mix of internal versus outsourced operations can make data connectivity\nmore complicated, as information must be moved between both internal systems\nof a business and the external systems of its third-party service provider.\n\n **Technological Barriers**\n\nAs Mathews explained, \u201ctechnical barriers\u201d are often to blame for the\nchallenge of payroll and accounting integration, especially in scenarios where\neach platform operates in different data formats and categories.\n\n\u201cA situation where this is especially true is when accounting software is\ninstalled directly on a company computer, and not accessible by a third party\nfor integration, due to firewalls and security measures,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this\nsituation, these programs generally offer file import/export options to get\ndata in and out of the software.\u201d\n\nThat tactic doesn\u2019t always guarantee speed and accuracy, however. With the\nrise of SaaS accounting and payroll solutions, though, web-based APIs \u2014\nhistorically unavailable with traditional enterprise software packages \u2014 have\nmade data accessibility \u201cvery easy.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to Intuit\u2019s QuickBooks Online platform as one example of how B2B\nFinTech firms are embracing the opportunity of data sharing, offering a suite\nof\n[APIs](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/most-\ncommonly-used/account) for third-party platforms \u2014 like OnTheClock \u2014 to\nseamlessly and quickly move data between each other.\n\n **A Changing Payroll Landscape**\n\nThe embrace of data connectivity between B2B FinTech platforms is occurring in\na time of significant change for the payroll sector as a whole. New solutions\nand payment functionality enable choice in how businesses pay and how\nemployees get paid, whether that be through direct deposit or payroll card,\nbiweekly or in real time.\n\nHowever, the payroll sector continues to be bogged down by legacy processes\nand tools, Mathews noted.\n\n\u201cWhile many employers [and] payroll providers are moving toward ACH direct\ndeposit, many employers are still printing employee paychecks,\u201d he said,\nadding that the continued use of paper and manual time-tracking, as well as\nemployee hour data kept in various formats, is also commonplace. These tactics\nlimit data integration capabilities, not to mention they expand the risk of\nerrors and lost money (for either a business or its employees).\n\nDigitization is on the rise. However, while SaaS adoption can address these\nfriction points, future shifts in the payroll landscape will introduce new\nchallenges to getting closer to the accounting team.\n\nMathews believes that the accounting industry will be \u201clargely unaffected\u201d by\nthe rise of the [gig economy](https://www.pymnts.com/study/gig-economy-\napril-2019/). Regardless of how a business pays a professional (or the\ncategory of that professional as an employee, contractor, gig worker or\notherwise), it must still collect that payment information, and record that\ndata into its accounting platform.\n\nWhat that means for the payroll and time-tracking space remains uncertain, he\nnoted. Depending on the legal categorization of a gig worker, Mathews said,\n\u201cthese freelancers will most likely never be on the company\u2019s payroll, but\nrather [be] paid a fixed fee using PayPal and other payment gateways, leaving\nboth payroll and time-tracking out of the mix.\u201d What that means for payroll\nand its relationship to accounting remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe all know how distributed \u2014 work-at-home \u2014 workers affected commercial real\nestate vacancies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big question is how the gig economy [will]\naffect payroll and time-keeping in the coming years.\u201d\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

smaller companies can still gain\nthe benefits of sleek and easy-to-use HR platforms.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | June 17, 2019\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) |\n[Compensation and\nBenefits](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/benefitsandcompensation/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) | [Southeast\nAsia](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/asean/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-991097114.jpg)\n\n\n\n_RenQun Huang of Gpayroll highlights how smaller companies can still gain the\nbenefits of sleek and easy-to-use HR platforms._\n\n### **What is Gpayroll\u2019s mission in the area of HR?**\n\nWe\u2019re on a long-term mission to redefine and revolutionise the payroll\nindustry by changing what ought to be a manual and complex task in a\nmeaningful way.\n\nPayroll is complex, tedious, time consuming and doesn\u2019t add value to growing\nyour business - but it is essential. This is the problem that we want to\nsolve, especially so for SMEs, who may not be able to afford enterprise\nsoftware for their payroll needs.\n\nBusiness owners need to watch out for payroll errors and declaring taxable\nincome incorrectly as this can result in hefty penalty fees. Payroll software\ncan minimise errors and streamlines the payroll processes.\n\n### **Who would benefit most from your technology?**\n\nSME business owners, HR professionals and accountants benefit the most from\nour software. Every business needs payroll. There are also business\noutsourcing providers who provide payroll outsourcing services.\n\nOur software is affordable, easy to use and scalable. This fits in to SMEs who\nare tight on budget. Payroll is already stressful enough for HR professionals,\naccountants and they just need the software to be user friendly.\n\nInstead of them trying to get the software to work, it should be the other way\nround. Our software works its way out for them automatically, allowing them to\nenjoy a peace of mind.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/2KW_1893.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/2KW_1893.jpg)\n\n_Gpayroll at the HR Festival Asia PitchFest_\n\n### **How does it stand out from the crowd?**\n\nMost payroll solutions in the market today solve only half the burden by\nproviding calculations only. This is where Gpayroll stands out. It covers not\nonly payroll calculations but also automates provident funds, tax filings (\n[AutoFiling](https://gpayroll.com/blog/payroll/guide-how-does-autowage-\nautofiling-actually-works.html)) and salary disbursement\n([AutoWage](https://gpayroll.com/blog/payroll/guide-how-does-autowage-\nautofiling-actually-works.html)).\n\nThe time saving from payroll administration can be used to work on improving\nemployee benefits and engagement. This helps to maintain a very healthy\nrelationship between the employee and the employer.\n\nFor business outsourcing providers, our software ensures that their clients\u2019\nemployees are paid on time. Payroll process is automated by schedule and\nregulatory updates are handled automatically in the background.\n\n### **You recently emerged tops at the inaugural HR Festival Asia PitchFest.\nWhat was that experience like?**\n\nIt was been a great experience. It is exciting to see the rise of HR Tech\nspace with great ideas coming from the startups. It also gave us the\nopportunity to make new friends, as well as catching up with existing ones in\nthe HR community.\n\nAt the same time, we are proud to be the winner of the HR Festival Asia\nPitchFest.\n\nWe have done several pitching in previous conferences but not in the HR space.\nOur past experiences enabled us to fine tune and polish our skill and [HR\nFestival PitchFest](http://hrmasia.com/g-payroll-takes-home-the-biggest-prize-\nat-the-hr-tech-pitchfest/) was a perfect opportunity for us to showcase our\nsolution to the HR community. We want to thank HRM Asia for giving us the\nopportunity.\n\n### **What is the in the future for Gpayroll?**\n\nWe grow together with our clients and this means that as our clients grow,\nthey will need a more comprehensive solution to cater to their payroll & HR\nneeds. As such, we are introducing new online HR modules that are integrated\nwith the existing solutions.\n\nThis provides a seamless payroll and HR experience in a single platform for\nits clients.\n\nPresently, most of our clients are SMEs. However, we are also looking to work\nwith multi-national corporations that need a regional platform to support\ntheir payroll and HR needs.\n\nGpayroll is present in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, China,\nTaiwan, Macau, South Korea and is looking at expanding to other countries such\nas Japan and Indonesia in the near future.\n\n* * *\n\n### _For more information about Gpayroll, head over\nto<https://www.gpayroll.com/>_\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-\npayroll-in-asia-pacific%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+Gpayroll+is+redefining+payroll+in+Asia-\nPacific&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-payroll-in-asia-\npacific%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-\npayroll-in-asia-pacific%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/how-\nfaster-payments-faster-data-drive-payroll-innovation/) __\n\nShifting employee landscapes, changes in workers ' demands over how and when\nthey get paid, and technological innovation have combined to open the\nfloodgates for payroll FinTech. However, a rise in new service providers has\nadded opportunity for industry consolidation, with payroll companies finding\nacquisitions a strategic way to augment their offerings, and keep pace with\nevolving needs among businesses and their employees.\n\nU.K.-based [The Access Group](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/) recently drove\nmarket consolidation with two takeovers,\n[announced](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/access-acquisitions-\nbroaden-payroll-software-footprint/) last month: that of human resources (HR)\nsolutions provider People HR, and of payroll technology company the Payroll\nService Company. In a statement at the time, the firm's CEO Chris Bayne said\nthe deals would strengthen the company's ability to promote efficiency in\npayroll departments, particularly for small and medium-sized business (SMB)\ncustomers.\n\nIn a recent interview with PYMNTS, The Access Group's Head of Access Payroll\nServices Vicky Smith discussed some of the strongest market forces placing\npressure on service providers to remain agile.\n\n **Speeding Up Wages**\n\nAmong the largest, she said, is an accelerating pay cycle. Unlike the U.S.,\nthe U.K. has only a minimal reliance on paper paychecks, with direct deposit\nvia the nation's Bacs payment service commonplace. However, the tradition of\nweekly payroll remains in place, with the payroll schedule of paying workers\non a monthly basis becoming more commonplace \u2014 which can present cash-flow\nissues for professionals with irregular work patterns.\n\n\"The ability to get paid as soon as you have worked will definitely impact the\ntraditional payroll service over the coming years,\" she said, \"but this will\nbe a great thing, in my opinion. The traditional three-day Bacs will no doubt\nchange over the coming years, with same-day payments becoming the norm, I\nhope.\"\n\nGoing a step further, in addition to wielding faster payment rails to ensure\nmoney lands in workers' accounts on time, Smith noted that she has seen an\nincreased demand for [on-demand pay](https://www.pymnts.com/news/faster-\npayments/2019/rtp-gig-economy-ach-flexwage-wagestream/) \u2014 and for payroll\nservice providers to meet that demand through features like early-wage-access\nprograms.\n\nIn a June report, [Pay Advances: The Gig Economy's New\nNormal](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/early-wage-access-\nemployers/), a collaboration with Mastercard, PYMNTS found that a significant\nportion of gig workers are willing to pay a fee to receive advance payment on\nearned wages, with analysts and service providers also finding opportunity for\nthe workforce outside of the gig economy to embrace on-demand wages.\n\n **Anticipating Globalization**\n\nThe growth in the gig worker population has undoubtedly driven the effort\ntoward same-day and real-time wage payouts, particularly as gig workers and\ncontractors struggle to manage cash-flow gaps and inconsistencies while\nemployers rely on monthly payroll schedules.\n\nHowever, the employee population is shifting in other ways, too, particularly\nas access to an international workforce becomes easier for SMBs. Smith noted\nthat the demand for cross-border payroll services in the U.K. is not\nnecessarily high today, but it is a trend she predicted will emerge moving\nforward.\n\n\"There will, no doubt, be more of a requirement for cross-border payroll\nservices over the coming years, as employers look to expand their businesses\nor look for cheaper workforces outside of the U.K.,\" she said, noting that\nBrexit has brought an additional layer of uncertainty. \"This will be tough for\nU.K.-based payroll providers, as the legislation for each country will be\ndifferent, but it will be something we have to learn and adapt to.\"\n\nGrowing availability of [real-time cross-border B2B\npayment](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2019/b2b-cross-border-\npayments-are-speeding-up/) services will also support businesses' ability to\ninitiate payments internationally to workers, regardless of market, while\nstill meeting their need for same-day and instant payouts.\n\n **A Higher Technological Standard**\n\nEmployees and talent aren't the only drivers of change in the payroll sector.\n\nBusinesses have been bogged down by legacy processes for years, with the\nstatus quo of weekly or monthly payouts largely reliant on in-house talent and\nlackluster tools that run the risk of errors. Furthermore, human-driven\npayroll operations mean businesses can struggle if their in-house payroll\nexperts are sick, on leave or exit a company.\n\n\"It can hit an organization hard,\" said Smith, \"and could lead to employees\nnot being paid correctly or even at all, which can be a serious issue.\"\n\nThe burden of back-office payroll processes is driving the embrace of\nautomation, she added, while business clients are also demanding payroll\ntechnologies that can integrate with the rest of their back-end operations.\nThat integration capability today is \"critical,\" she noted, enabling\nbusinesses to not only accelerate the pace at which funds land in employee\nbank accounts, but the pace at which that payroll data is automatically\nentered into their accounting and other financial management systems.\n\n\"Gone are the days of paper pay slips to your door,\" she said. \"Technology and\napps are the way forward.\"\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

[Operator\ninstructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your\nspeaker today, Bob LaFleur, vice president of investor relations and capital\nmarkets. Thank you.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\n **Bob LaFleur** \\-- _Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital\nMarkets_\n\nThank you for joining us on the call today to discuss our fourth-quarter and\nfull-year 2019 results. Joining me today are Chewy's CEO, Sumit Singh; and CFO\nMario Marte. Our earnings release and letter to shareholders, which were filed\nwith the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, have been posted to the Investor\nRelations section of our website, investor.chewy.com. A link to the webcast of\ntoday's conference call is also available on our site.\n\nOn our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements, including\nstatements concerning Chewy's future prospects, financial results; business\nstrategies; industry trends and our ability to successfully respond to\nbusiness risks, including those related to the spread of COVID-19, including\nany adverse impacts on our supply chain, workforce, fulfillment centers, other\nfacilities, customer service operations and future plans. Such statements are\nconsidered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our\nforward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered an\nindication of future performance. Also note that the forward-looking\nstatements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's\ndate.\n\nWe disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as\nrequired by law. For further information, please refer to the risk factors and\nother information in Chewy's 10-K and 8-K filed earlier today and in our other\nfilings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided on our Investor\nRelations website and in our earnings release and letter to shareholders,\nwhich were filed with the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP results.\nAdditionally, as a reminder, prior-period results this quarter include an\nextra week. So on an as-reported basis, Q4 2019 results reflect 13 weeks of\noperations, while Q4 2018 results reflect 14 weeks. Likewise, full-year fiscal\n2019 results reflect 52 weeks of operations, while full-year fiscal 2018\nresults reflect 53 weeks of operations.\n\nIn our reported results for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2018, the extra week\ncontributed $82.9 million in additional net sales, which included $49.1\nmillion of Autoship customer sales. For comparability, during our call today,\nall year-over-year growth rates discussed regarding net sales, Autoship\ncustomer sales and net sales per active customer reflect comparable 13- or\n52-week periods. Finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast on our\nInvestor Relations website. A replay of this call will also be available on\nour IR website shortly.\n\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Sumit.\n\n**Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThanks, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call. Before I get\nstarted, I want to welcome Bob to the Chewy team. He brings extensive\nexperience on both the sell-side and investor relations areas, and we are\nexcited to have him on the team as we enter our second year as a public\ncompany. While 2019 closed on a high note and 2020 got off to a similarly\nstrong start, suddenly, the world changed in a big way.\n\nAs we have seen, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption to\nglobal commerce and financial markets. Our hearts go out to those directly\naffected by this disease and those suffering from the economic and social\ndislocation that have followed in its wake. It is in times like these when our\nmission to be the most trusted and convenient online destination for pet\nparents everywhere rings truer than ever. As pet parents, we know how special\nand comforting the bond is between humans and pets, especially in these\nstressful times.\n\nHow soothing a simple act like a game of fetch with your dog or curling up on\nthe couch with your cat can be. We devote ourselves every day to supporting\nthese special relationships. We are here for our pet parents and their pets\nworking 24/7 to meet their needs while caring for the safety and well-being of\nour team members. Our shop-at-home business is proving resilient amid the\ncurrent economic disruption.\n\nOur volumes have increased as customers have chosen to stay at home and take\nadvantage of the shopping convenience that we provide. We will discuss the\nfinancial impact of current trends and our guidance a little later in this\ncall. Taking care of our team members, health and well-being is essential to\nall of us in the Chewy leadership team, and we are being highly proactive in\nour internal response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are in constant\ncommunication to plan and adapt as swiftly as possible to these rapidly\nevolving conditions, and our COVID-19 response team is providing daily updates\nto our team members across the company.\n\nWe have expanded our health benefits and revised our PTO and sick-day policies\nto meet the evolving needs of this unique situation. Additionally, we have\nmaterially increased cleaning and sanitizing procedures throughout our work\nsites, including our customer service sites and fulfillment centers. We have\ninstituted work from home at our corporate locations, as well as for a portion\nof our customer service teams. Regarding our fulfillment centers and customer\nservice centers, we have detailed contingency plans in place should we\nexperience an on-site COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWe have the ability to divert fulfillment and/or customer service contacts to\nother facilities while we isolate and restore the affected facility. We\nbelieve we can absorb the facility being off-line for a short period of time\nwith minimal incremental disruption to customer service levels. So with that,\nlet's discuss our Q4 financial performance and some of the key milestones and\nachievements contained in our full-year 2019 results. I'll update you on some\nbusiness initiatives and then turn the call over to Mario to discuss our Q4\nand full-year results in more detail and to discuss our guidance.\n\nAs I indicated, we closed 2019 on a high note. In Q4, net sales grew 35% to\n$1.4 billion or 1.5 times full-year sales just three years ago, underscoring\nthe power of our business model. We ended the quarter and year with 13.5\nmillion active customers, an increase of 2.9 million customers compared to the\nend of fiscal 2018, and our net sales per active customer grew 10% to $360.\nOur subscription-like Autoship business remains strong, with Autoship\ncustomers representing over 70% of total net sales in Q4.\n\nHigher spending from our existing customers and growing Autoship sales reflect\nstrong business momentum as more customers continue to shift their spending to\nChewy, driving increased basket size and higher repeat purchase activity. In\nQ4, we were again able to expand margins while growing the top line. Q4 gross\nmargin expanded 320 basis points versus prior-year fourth quarter to 24.1%. Q4\nadjusted EBITDA margin expanded 470 basis points over Q4 2018 to negative\n0.4%, reflecting the progress we have made on gross margin expansion and the\nongoing scaling of our advertising and marketing spend.\n\nLooking broadly at 2019, the sum of our efforts came through in our results.\nFor the full year, we grew net sales by 40% to $4.85 billion, expanded gross\nmargin by 340 basis points to 23.6% and improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by\n480 basis points to negative 1.7%. We continue to get big fast while getting\nfit fast, as demonstrated by growth in our top line and improvement in our\nbottom line. We know the opportunity in front of us remains large and now even\nmore so.\n\nAs some of you may already know, in 2019, the Chewy team made great strides\ntoward becoming the most trusted and convenient destination for pet parents\neverywhere. We innovated at pace, made smart investments in marketing and site\nmerchandising and introduced new products and solutions that enhanced and\nstreamlined the shopping experience for pet parents, fueling greater trust\ntoward our brand. We continue to grow and make targeted investments in our\nstrategic pillars, private brands, and Chewy Pharmacy, and we expanded our\nnetwork of fulfillment centers. The American Pet Products Association or APPA\nrecently announced that U.S.\n\nsales of pet products and services surpassed $95 billion in 2019 and are\nprojected to reach nearly $100 billion in 2020. So not only is the addressable\nmarket larger than previously estimated, but the pace of growth remains\nrobust. Additional research from APPA indicates that 72% of pet owners\nreported making at least one online purchase for their pet in the past 12\nmonths. Of those making subscription-based purchases of pet products, 94%\nreport that their buying frequency has increased or stayed the same in the\npast 12 months.\n\nClearly, these trends all bode well for the future sustainability of our\noverall value proposition at this pace. When you combine a growing category,\ncustomer migration from off-line to online and Chewy's unique shopping\nexperience and award-winning customer service, we believe that we are still in\nthe early innings of our growth. To this end, the core inputs of our business\ncontinue to trend positively. We remain maniacally focused on execution and\nare delivering the best possible customer experience for pet parents.\n\nWe are convinced that we are positively transforming an industry by creating a\ntruly unique and personalized shopping experience, one that builds trust,\nbrand loyalty and drives repeat purchasing. Our focus on these pillars\nultimately supports our long-term goals of sustainable top-line growth at\nscale and incremental margin expansion. Now I would like to share a few\nbusiness highlights from our fourth quarter and, broadly, full-year 2019 and\nalso provide insight into our thinking for fiscal-year 2020. As I noted on the\nQ3 earnings call in December, we went into the Q4 holiday cycle well planned\nand ready to delight customers.\n\nOur thoughtful and integrated go-to-market approach, resonated well with\ncustomers and reflected in both our demand and conversion metrics, leading to\nrecord-setting days with Cyber Monday being the single biggest shopping day in\nour company's history. We continue to remain disciplined and data-driven in\nevery investment-related decision that we make. For instance, in marketing, we\nclosely track key metrics like customer acquisition cost and lifetime value\nand have been investing in tools to optimize our model and drive further\nefficiencies. The data management platform or the DMP, combined with our\nongoing optimizations in marketing data science, is enabling us to more\nefficiently target existing and new customer audiences across the industry,\nresulting in more efficient use of our marketing spend.\n\nFor example, in Q4, our performance marketing teams, in conjunction with our\nmarketing science teams, use the DMP to target new prospective audiences.\nWithin the specific channels where we were most utilizing our DMP, we observed\nfavorable trends in both customer acquisitions and cost per acquisition.\nLooking back at 2019, we are pleased with the progress we have made across\nChewy private brands and Chewy Healthcare, two areas we discussed in some\ndetail on last quarter's call. Both are critical components of the overall\nvalue proposition we offer Chewy customers, and in 2020, we will build upon\nthe momentum established last year in these two important business lines.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2020, we are staying ahead of the curve and driving\ninnovations in areas that not only enhance the customer experience but also\nincrease efficiency and streamline our cost structures. One such area this\nyear is our fulfillment network where, barring any disruptions related to a\nbroadening of the COVID-19 crisis, we are planning to launch two new\nfulfillment centers or FCs in FY 2020, starting with our new facility in\nSalisbury, North Carolina, which is planned to launch later this month. This\nwill be our tenth FC and will enable us to more quickly and efficiently reach\nmillions of customers across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast region. Then later\nin the year, barring any unforeseen delays or schedule changes caused by\nCOVID-19-related government mandates, we expect to launch our 11th FC in\nArchibald, Pennsylvania, which is currently under construction.\n\nThis will be our first automated fulfillment center, and we are very excited\nabout it. This state-of-the-art facility will raise the bar on future upgrades\nto our fulfillment network. Over the last few years, we have made significant\nimprovements across our fulfillment operations, which you may recall is\nlargely manual and driven by lean manufacturing principles, driving efficiency\nand reducing our fixed and variable fulfillment cost per unit in the process.\nThese initiatives have yielded meaningful cost savings that, over time, will\naccelerate our SG&A efficiency curve.\n\nAutomating the Archibald fulfillment center will enable us to increase\nthroughput capacity of this building versus similarly sized facilities by more\nthan 25%, increased labor productivity by more than 50% and, as a direct\nresult of all of the above, enabled us to further lower our fixed and variable\nfulfillment cost per unit by over 30%. Equally importantly, it will create a\nsafer and more productive environment for our team members to work within.\nLeaning on our disciplined and data-driven approach, we made bold investments\nin the areas where we believe we can improve experience and generate outsized\nreturns for our shareholders, put a rigorous measurement framework around it\nand then aim to execute flawlessly to achieve the results. The same framework\nis an application here, and we expect to generate attractive returns on\ninvestments we are making into our fulfillment network.\n\nAs in many ways, the payback is more direct. The investments we make in\ndriving efficiencies in our fulfillment network, which you'll see in our SG&A\nand capex, result in direct cost savings, which fall, dollar for dollar,\nstraight to the bottom line and are meaningful profitability accelerators. A\nfinal note on COVID-19 situation before I conclude. I touched on the demand\nside of this equation in my opening remarks, but I know many of you are also\ncurious about potential vulnerabilities in our supply chain.\n\nWhen you look at the details of our supply chain, consumables, mostly food and\ntreats, represent over 70% of our sales. These products are sourced almost\nexclusively in the U.S., and we were proactive in jointly planning supply and\ntransportation requirements with our strategic vendors. Our hard goods\nsourcing is more diversified, and we actively manage our inventory levels to\nprotect against potential disruptions in the supply chain given the long lead\ntimes from order to having the inventory on hand. Last but not least, our\nproactive and extensive cleaning and sanitizing procedures throughout our work\nsites, including our fulfillment centers and customer service sites, have thus\nfar prevented any confirmed COVID-19 cases across our work sites, minimizing\nany disruptions to our network.\n\nSo far, we have not seen material disruptions in our operations or supply\nchain. However, the situation is evolving on a daily basis, and we continue to\nmonitor the impact on our business and our future plans for the business.\nRegarding guidance, given where we are in the first quarter, we are\ncomfortable providing guidance for the current quarter, and Mario will discuss\nthis shortly. Due to the evolving situation with the COVID-19 outbreak, as\nwell as the active risk it poses to all of us, including our partners and\nnetwork, we do not think it prudent to provide full-year guidance at this\ntime.\n\nWe do not take this move lightly, especially because at this time, as I\nindicated in my opening remarks, volumes are running ahead of our expectations\nfrom earlier in the quarter. That said, in light of the unprecedented nature\nof the current pandemic, the steps being taken to mitigate the outbreak and\nthe sheer number of other variables outside our control, we believe that this\nis the best course of action. We thank you in advance for your understanding\non this matter, and we hope to be able to update you with more clarity on our\nQ1 call in early June. 2019 was an important year for Chewy, and while I'll\nnote that we were pleased with our IPO last June, it was just one step in a\nlong journey.\n\nWe continue to believe that we are in early stages of a large market\nopportunity of offering pet parents a unique value proposition. We are working\ntoward building an enduring franchise through exceptional rigor that delivers\ntop-line growth and expanded operating margins and disciplined cash flow\nmanagement. We are as excited as ever about the opportunity ahead of us, and\nwe look forward to a great 2020. Now I will turn the call over to Mario, who\nwill provide the details on our Q4 results and walk you through our current\nfinancial outlook.\n\nMario?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nThank you, Sumit. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth-quarter results\nhighlight our disciplined execution and the power of a customer-centric model,\ncombined with the convenience of e-commerce in the pet category. Fourth-\nquarter net sales reached $1.35 billion, bringing our total fiscal 2019 net\nsales to $4.85 billion.\n\nRemoving the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter last year, this\nrepresents 35% growth in the quarter and 40% growth for the year, driven by\ncontinued growth in our customer base and net sales per active customer.\nAutoship customer sales growth outpaced overall net sales growth for both Q4\nand full-year 2019. Autoship customer sales for the fourth quarter of 2019\nwere $954.2 million, representing 70.4% of total net sales and reflected 40.8%\ngrowth compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Autoship customer sales for the\nfull year were $3.36 billion or 69.4% of total net sales, reflecting 47.9%\ngrowth compared to 2018.\n\nWe ended the fourth quarter and year with 13.5 million active customers, an\nincrease of 2.9 million customers versus the end of fiscal-year 2018. The\nincrease in active customers is new customers added in the period minus any\ncustomers who have not made a purchase in the last 364 days. Net sales per\nactive customer for fiscal 2019 increased 10.4% year over year to $360. As a\nreminder, net sales per active customer for any period equals that period's\ntrailing four-quarter net sales divided by the number of active customers at\nthe end of said period.\n\nNet sales per active customer in fiscal 2018 and first three quarters of 2019\nbenefited by approximately $7 to $8 from the inclusion of the extra week in Q4\n2018 without any corresponding increase in active customers. Q4 gross margin\nincreased 320 basis points to 24.1%. For the full year, gross margin increased\n340 basis points to 23.6%. As we have shared previously, our goal is to\ndeliver gradual and incremental gross margin expansion on an annual basis.\n\n2019 gross margins benefited from growth in average order values, high\nAutoship sales, increasing mix from our newest verticals and the overall\nleveraging of our cost structure. Q4 operating expenses, which include SG&A\nand advertising and marketing, were $386.8 million or 28.6% of net sales. For\nthe full-year 2019, operating expenses totaled $1.4 billion or 28.8% of full-\nyear net sales. SG&A, which comprises all fulfillment costs, customer service,\ncredit card processing fees, corporate G&A, public company costs and corporate\npayroll, including share-based compensation, totaled $284.9 million in the\nfourth quarter or 21% of net sales.\n\nExcluding share-based compensation and public company costs such as D&O\ninsurance and increased audit and legal services, SG&A was 17.2% of net sales\nin the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 15.8% last year. For full-year 2019,\nSG&A was 20% of net sales compared to 16.7% in 2018. Excluding share-based\ncompensation and public company costs, SG&A was 16.8% of net sales in 2019,\ncompared to 16.3% in 2018. We continue to aggressively manage our SG&A cost\nstructure.\n\nThe operational areas of SG&A, fulfillment and customer service represents\nmost of this line item. In these areas, we have successfully scaled our\nheadcount and reduced our related expenses as a percent of net sales by 20\nbasis points in 2019. The rate of growth we saw in SG&A in 2019 in excess of\nour net sales growth was almost exclusively related to the share-based\ncompensation and the additional professional services and other costs\nassociated with becoming and being a public company. As we look forward, we\nbelieve we will continue to scale SG&A and that on a fully loaded basis,\nannual SG&A as a percentage of net sales should decline versus fiscal 2019.\n\nLooking at SG&A, excluding share-based compensation and public company\nexpenses, we expect to see positive leverage materialize toward the back half\nof 2020. Q4 advertising and marketing was $101.8 million or 7.5% of net sales,\ntailing 330 basis points year over year. For the year, advertising and\nmarketing improved 230 basis points to 8.8% of net sales. As Sumit mentioned,\ncustomer retention remains strong, and we are pleased at our various growth\ninitiatives and investments in enhancing the customer experience are\ncontributing to ongoing expansion in the lifetime value or LTV of our\ncustomers.\n\nLTV measures the cumulative contribution profit we derive from each of our\ncohorts. When we compare our customer acquisition costs or CAC to lifetime\nvalues on our most recent marketing investments, we are finding equal or\nfaster payback periods that prove out the efficacy of our recent efforts.\nFourth-quarter net loss was $60.9 million as net margin improved 160 basis\npoints to negative 4.5%. Excluding share-based compensation of $45.9 million,\nour fourth-quarter net loss was $15.1 million, and net margin improved 460\nbasis points to negative 1.1%.\n\nFor the full year, net loss was $252.4 million and net margin improved 240\nbasis points to negative 5.2%. Excluding share-based compensation of $136.2\nmillion, our net loss was $116.1 million, and net margin improved 480 basis\npoints to negative 2.4%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss was $5.8 million, and our\nadjusted EBITDA margin improved 470 basis points to negative 0.4%. For the\nfull-year 2019, adjusted EBITDA loss was $81 million, and our adjusted EBITDA\nmargin improved 480 basis points to negative 1.7%.\n\nImprovements in both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our\nability to grow the top line, improvements in gross margin, scaling of\nadvertising and marketing and improved efficiencies in SG&A, all of which is\nconsistent with our strategy of long-term sustainable growth and margin\nexpansion. Adjusted EBITDA continues to be a managed output in that we invest\nthe profits we earn from repeat orders and the cash we generate from managing\nour working capital into new customer acquisition. In Q4, we generated a\npositive free cash flow of $60.42 million, with $74.3 million of positive cash\nfrom operations, offset by $10.1 million in capital investment. Q4 is a\nseasonally strong cash-generating quarter for us, whereas in Q1, we expect to\nbe a net user of cash.\n\nQ4 capital investments were primarily comprised of cash outlays for IT\nequipment, capitalization of internal and external labor and payments\nassociated with our new fulfillment centers in Dayton, Ohio, and Salisbury,\nNorth Carolina. For the full-year 2019, free cash flow was negative $2.1\nmillion, with $46.6 million of positive cash from operations, offset by $48.7\nmillion in capital investments. We ended the year with $212 million in cash\nand cash equivalents on the balance sheet. As evidenced by our full-year\nresults, in 2019, we successfully reinvested our profits from existing\ncustomers and cash from working capital to essentially breakeven on a free\ncash flow basis.\n\nNow I'll turn to guidance. Entering 2020, our team is singularly aligned on\nour mission, and we continue to see investment opportunities that will bolster\nour growth strategy and further extend our market leadership. As Sumit\nmentioned, the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has altered consumer\nshopping behavior in recent weeks. We have seen this at Chewy as concerned pet\nparents stocked up on necessities like food and other essentials, and as\ncustomers shift to their shopping from off-line to online channels in support\nof social distancing efforts.\n\nBeginning in late February, we saw an acceleration in sales, which has\ncontinued through today, and our first-quarter guidance reflects these trends.\nSo for the first quarter of 2020, we are expecting net sales between $1.50\nbillion and $1.52 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 35%\nand 37%. To reiterate Sumit's comments, we are still in a rapidly evolving\nsituation, one in which we are planning and adapting to swiftly and\nappropriately. And at this time, we do not believe it is prudent to provide\nfull-year guidance.\n\nWhile we are not giving full-year guidance at this time, I will leave you with\na few things to keep in mind as you build out your models. The high\noperational tempo required to meet peak demand periods like we are\nexperiencing now can impact efficiency on the fulfillment side. Also, when the\ncoronavirus situation abates, we may experience some moderation of demand as\ncustomers draw down their stockpiled supplies. As you would expect from us by\nnow, we are monitoring all relevant metrics, and we'll make decisions based on\nall available data, keeping the long-term strategic goals in mind.\n\nMy last modeling notice, a reminder that 2020, like 2019, will be a 52-week\nyear. In fact, we won't have another 53-week year until 2024. I will conclude\nby saying we are pleased with our full-year 2019 results and look forward to\nfull-year 2020. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for\nquestions.\n\nOperator?\n\n## Questions & Answers:\n\n  \n\n**Operator**\n\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Cassel with\nMorgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the acceleration that you've seen\nsince late February. Maybe give us some color on what the key drivers of that\nacceleration have been? Has it been existing customers placing larger orders\nor ordering more frequently, or have you actually seen an acceleration in new\ncustomer growth over the past four to five weeks?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Lauren, this is Sumit. I'll take that. So first of all, I think as we\nanticipate, our business continues to be recession-resilient during this time,\nand we're proud to be serving millions of customers who are relying on us. The\nacceleration in demand and the elevated demand patterns are coming from both\nsides.\n\nWe've seen our existing customers, 13.5 million of them, order in, but we've\nalso seen a meaningful lift in new customers coming in through the platform.\nSo at this point, it's a combination.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nOK, great. And then just any incremental color on not specific numbers, which\nis sort of the cadence of the acceleration. Was there a peak maybe two weeks\nago when things have moderated a bit? Are you still seeing really strong\ndemand even this week?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe are continuing to see strong demand, as Mario mentioned in the script,\nthrough the end of February up until as of yesterday.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nThanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to ask about gross\nmargins. We saw the 320 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Can you just\nupdate us where you are on private label and how big you think that can\nbecome? And then anything to specifically point out in terms of where you saw\nsome other leverage and scale with partners? And then just on the COVID-19\nimpact, just trying to understand kind of your view and confidence in your\nability to handle the extra demand? And now that -- I understand why you\nwouldn't give guidance for the full year, but given the fact that you're two-\nthirds through the quarter, as you pointed out, why not give the 1Q profit\nguide? Thanks.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Doug, this is Sumit. I'll take that one. So private brands continues to\nbe a strategic vector for us. We continue to see private brands grow at the\nrate of 1.5 times.\n\nWe also continue to see private brands improve their profit margin roughly 500\nbasis points year over year. And most of that was led by our focus on hard\ngoods because as you remember from our strategy, we are careful about going\ninto market and not creating one-for-one SKU where customers might have\nloyalty to certain brands. But where product lines are commoditized or where\nwe can find differentiated value proposition, we are opportunistic about\noffering that assortment and convenience to customers. So that's how I would\nlook at that.\n\nIn terms of COVID, your second question was do we -- hang on, handling the\nextra demand. Can you repeat the second question, Doug?\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nConfidence in handling the extra demand that you're seeing in terms of\nfulfillment in the warehouses and then why not at least guide to profitability\nfor fiscal 1Q.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nYes. OK. Yes, yes. So super proud of the internal team at Chewy at this time\ncoming together in the way that we have.\n\nWe continue to take care of our team members, and our team members continue to\ntake care of our customers. Of course, demand requires executing to it, and\nwe're executing to our demand. We don't have concerns. All of the controllable\nfactors, which we control, we're maniacally focused on.\n\nAnd we believe our ability to execute and confidence toward executing that\ndemand remains high. In terms of not guiding to profit, we believe that we're\nstill in a rapidly evolving situation. We're seeing headwinds and tailwinds\nthat do not provide us the full clarity at this time. For example, we're\nmaking meaningful investments in personnel to make sure that our employees\nfeel valued at this time, and we're also investing in making sure that we are\nhiring 6,000 to 10,000 more people during this time.\n\nSo our level of operation and investment is as you would expect to see during\npeak periods. We've also invested in elevated sanitization and cleaning\nprocedures. On the flip side, if you look at the demand side, we're seeing\nincreased OE and increased participation from customers, but we're also seeing\nan increased meaningful lift in new customers that actually -- where we have\nto provide first-time discounts and Autoship discounts that are going out. And\nthen finally, we're just not sure of any kind of disruptions that might occur\nfrom this point onwards, so at this point, we don't believe it's prudent to\nprovide profit guidance.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nIs that 6,000 to 10,000 you mentioned, is that all in fulfillment centers? Or\nis some of that in customer service as well?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nIt is primarily in fulfillment centers to handle the demand shock that we've\nseen. We're seeing slightly elevated levels of backlog. And to handle that\nbacklog, we're upping our forecast at this point for labor, which we're proud\nof. I mean, supporting employment at this time in the marketplace is something\nthat we're proud that we're doing.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Brian Fitzgerald** \\-- _Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst_\n\nThanks, guys. I wanted to ask about stock-outs and extended shipping times,\nwhat impacts that's having on demand. It does not seem to be dissuading\npurchases. We've done some simple polling, and it says, \"Hey, I may not be\ngetting the beef, but I'm switching over to chicken,\" that type of thing.\n\nCan you talk about is it dissuading purchases or causing breakage? Or is it\ninstead a substitution maybe into more private label? Can you unpack that a\nbit for us?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nSure. So we've seen no material disruption to supply chain or customer\nordering behavior. Our conversion for the most part remains intact. And the\nreason for that is as you intuited.\n\nEven though a small percentage of our portfolio is out of stock, most\ncustomers -- or two points there. One, we pre-empt and protect and reserve\ninventory allocation for our Autoship customers. And then two, most customers\nare able to either switch into a different pattern, design or brand. So the\noverall loss at this point is minimal, driven by out of stocks.\n\nWe're also jointly deep with planning and recovery efforts with our suppliers\nand vendors who are being super supportive at this point.\n\n **Brian Fitzgerald** \\-- _Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst_\n\nThanks, Sumit. Appreciate it.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.\n\n **Mark Mahaney** \\-- _RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nI have two questions, please. First, that increase in the -- is it APPA\nestimate of pet sales? Sumit, do you have any detail behind that? What would\nhave caused them to increase their estimates? Any color there? I assume you\nprobably have a little bit of the background on that. And then in terms of the\nnew customers that have come on, you've talked about the acceleration in\ngrowth, greater-than-expected growth, whatever this quarter being, both\nexisting and the new customers. Do you have any read into what the quality of\nthese new customers is like in the first four, six weeks? Are they acting like\nnew customers have in the past? Is there anything that suggests that they are\ngoing to be less loyal, less spending in the future with you that they're\nmigrating faster or slower? Is there anything that suggest that they're going\nto act differently than your prior cohorts, or is it just too early to tell?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThank you, Mark. Both good questions. I'll take the second one first. It is\ntoo early for us to tell.\n\nWe know that we are offering the same great service and similar value\nproposition. Some of the core input metrics of AOE and units per order and\nbasket size and the mixing seems very similar to our existing cohorts. But\nthen again, we're acquiring these customers during duress and an unprecedented\ntime, and so it's hard for us to really calculate at this time how sticky\nthese customers are going to be or how much similarly they're going to behave\nthrough our existing cohorts. That being said, we are going to work very hard\non our side to ensure that we engendered long-term loyalty from this\nparticular cohort that we're acquiring during this time.\n\nSo that's sort of the checks and balances that I was talking about when I was\nanswering Doug's question earlier as well. In terms of the first question, I\nthink the increase is driven by a couple of different trends. One, there's a\nlot more awareness about pets. And as millennials come into the marketplace,\nthere's a higher degree of pet ownership that we're seeing from that segment.\n\nNumber two, we've always known and talked about the premiumization in this\nspace, which is actually pushing up ASPs for newer and fresher categories that\nare entering the marketplace right now that might mature over the next few\nyears. So likely a combination there. We continue to monitor and watch this\none.\n\n **Mark Mahaney** \\-- _RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nOK. It's very interesting here. Thank you, Sumit.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.\n\n **Eric Sheridan** \\-- _UBS -- Analyst_\n\nThanks so much for taking the question, and thanks for the update, Sumit, from\nyou and the team. I hope everyone's family and friends are well dealing with\nwhat we're dealing with. I wanted to ask a question about the data-driven\nmarketing push. There's been a lot of dislocation in digital and the off-line\nadvertising over the last four to six weeks.\n\nYou guys have made a lot of investments around data-driven marketing. Is there\nanything you guys are doing in terms of changing the channels where you might\nbe allocating investments to drive positive ROI marketing decisions? Are you\narcing any changes in the way you're making investment, or are you seeing any\nchanges in ROI in the current environment? Thanks so much.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nEric, thank you for the question. I hope you're safe and well as well. I won't\nspeak to the specific channels for competitive sensitivity reasons. I will\nprovide overall color.\n\nWe have seen a strong influx of organic demand, and we're utilizing and\ndoubling down on our relationship and content-driven marketing in this time to\nbe able to reach consumers and utilizing those channels to be able to educate\nconsumers, not only on the benefit of health and wellness but also on how to\nengage with pets during stay at home. So what that's done to us is it's driven\n-- we've taken advantage of this period and actually scaled back on marketing,\nwhere we believe it's not prudent to overspend during this time and are\nbanking on those efficiencies during this time, fully realizing that we don't\nreally, really, really know the quality of the cohort that we're acquiring, so\nwe might have to go back and actually invest a little bit of that back into\nretention. But we'll continue to be data-driven and disciplined around that as\nwell.\n\n **Eric Sheridan** \\-- _UBS -- Analyst_\n\nThank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Erin Wright** \\-- _Credit Suisse -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks. How big is your pharmacy segment now? Does that include\nprescription, as well as over-the-counter therapeutics? And are you seeing\nmore meaningful traction just in the current environment? Are veterinarians\nmore willing to work with you in light of the COVID disruption?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nErin, I'll start with the second one. We're not seeing material disruption at\nthis point. There are a couple of things that we're observing in the\nenvironment and the field right now. We're seeing vets more and more either\nreduce their hours or reduce the availability of services to more critical-\ntype services.\n\nThat being said, parasiticides and heartworm that drive primarily the share in\nthe category, we haven't seen a -- we actually have seen continued growth, an\nacceleration across the pharmacy business for us during this time, fully\nrealizing we're in peak. I think another thing that we are benefited by is our\nscripts that are on Autoship continue to be fulfilled. And on the flip side --\nand we haven't seen a drop in approval rates during this time. So on a macro\nlevel, we're not seeing much.\n\nHeartworm prescription is where you do need to go see the vet. And if the vet\nis closed, if there was any impact, we wouldn't be seeing it right now because\nthere's a bit of a lag because only the scripts that are expiring in the last\nfew weeks would be subject to that particular condition. So hopefully, that\nprovides a little bit of a color. Overall, we continue to see strong demand\nand the same acceleration in our Rx business as well.\n\nAnd then in our pharmacy, when we talk about pharmacy, we speak only\nspecifically prescription. We don't consider -- we're not counting OTC drugs\nas part of that.\n\n **Erin Wright** \\-- _Credit Suisse -- Analyst_\n\nOK, great. And then we also noticed -- this is another healthcare question,\nbut we also noticed you had a meaningful presence at VMX this year for the\nfirst time. Are you seeing material traction when establishing those formal\nrelationships with veterinarians and utilization of your prescription\nmanagement platform? I guess can you speak to sort of the economics behind\nsome of those relationships directly with the veterinarians where you've been\nable to establish those?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nGood question. We were at VMX because we continue to believe that we are a\nbrand that can drive meaningful penetration into the category by educating\nconsumers and driving more and more consumers to visit vet clinics, which then\nexpands the overall share of the TAM that is currently available, not only by\nincreasing the visits but also increasing repeat purchase rates for\nprescription. On the basis of that, we were there displaying our products that\nessentially go toward educating customers. We were also showcasing our\nproducts that we've developed for vet offices and for vets to be able to\nincrease their productivity in office and also to invite them to write for\nPetMD, which is a tremendous asset that they engage with that provides benefit\nback into our customers, and the vets actually are compensated for that.\n\nSo there's a lot in the evolution right now. We were pleased to be there. We\nwill continue to talk about how we can add meaningful value and also find\nopportunities where we can meaningfully partner with veterinarians but still\nearly in the journey there.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Deepak Mathivanan** \\-- _Barclays -- Analyst_\n\nGuys, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. So first, Mario,\ncan you elaborate a little bit on the first-quarter guidance? March\naccelerated nicely compared to Feb. Are you expecting acceleration in April in\nyour outlook? And is there any way you can kind of maybe quantify the March\ntrends versus Feb? And then a big-picture question for Sumit.\n\nWhere do you think online-offline mix would be in the post COVID-19 world? Do\nyou expect any meaningful disruption to the off-line channels that could\naccelerate the online penetration gains in the next, say, 12 to 18 months?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nDeepak, good to talk to you. To your question on what we expect in April,\nlook, we just provided guidance. And the fact is that we are operating in an\nunprecedented time, and the situation is evolving as we speak. So at this\ntime, I think we're comfortable providing the guidance that we just shared a\nfew minutes ago, and there's probably nothing more to add in terms of speed or\nvelocity for April.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nDeepak, this is Sumit. In terms of the second question, we've always\nmaintained the data that we've known is the online penetration should get to\nnorth of 20%, 25% over the next couple of years. We remain bullish on that\ntrend. We don't know why online penetration cannot get north of 35%, 40%, 45%.\n\nAnd occurrences like the one that we're in right now provide motivation and\ntailwinds to a shift in consumer pattern and behavior. We are yet to obviously\nsee how much of that is going to be sticky over the long term, but there's\ndefinitely going to be an impact here over the long term.\n\n **Deepak Mathivanan** \\-- _Barclays -- Analyst_\n\nOK. Thanks, guys. Very helpful.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Kelley with Nomura. Your line is open.\n\n **Mark Kelley** \\-- _Nomura Instinet -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Two quick ones. The first one, just on the acceleration\nthat you're seeing.\n\nCurious if it's concentrated in the hardest hit areas like in New York, New\nYork City area. Or is it broader than that? And second, I'd love to hear what\nyou guys are seeing on the advertising front, given that your ad budget is\nfairly broad. You gave some good color on the D&P a bit, but curious where are\nyou seeing the biggest opportunities with less demand on the advertising\nfront. Thank you.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Mark, good to hear from you. No, we're not seeing any major\nconcentrations in the way that that demand is right now segregated. We're\nseeing a fairly uniform lift across the country, and we're fulfilling that\nacross our fulfillment centers all across the country. In terms of advertising\nchannels, I will refrain from speaking specifically to the advertising\nchannels, again, for sensitivity reasons.\n\nBut as you would expect, I mean, people are -- folks have more time to be able\nto engage with content-driven channels. And we are fairly, fairly observant of\nthat, and we're adapting to our strategy in a similar manner and also pulling\nback on channels where we don't believe is optimal due to the organic nature\nof people translating their queries and, therefore, being able to find us in\nan organic fashion. Hopefully, that provides some help.\n\n **Mark Kelley** \\-- _Nomura Instinet -- Analyst_\n\nIt does. Thank you, Sumit.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nThanks. Just on the headcount side, if you took the midpoint of your headcount\nhiring, that would be a 67% increase from the February. And I'm just curious\nhow you think about the efficiency of those hires, and there's been a lot of\nconversations around the cost of hiring right now. Give us a sense of how\nyou're able to build that out with controlling the expense scale.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe continue to see headcount leverage across our businesses that are stable\nand mature across corporate headcount, and we're very prudent and very\ndisciplined in the way that we invest for that headcount. To give you a\nperspective, we're a company of somewhere between 13,000, 14,000 employees.\nAnd our corporate, even at this point, at being the scale that we are, is\nroughly 1,200 people. So most of our investments are in fulfillment and\ncustomer service.\n\nAnd we are continuing to invest in our fulfillment capabilities and customer\nservice to be able to service customers because that really is our moat in the\nway that we earn trust and maintain long-term loyalty.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nAnd when you think about the positive momentum you're seeing, does that give\nyou more conviction to experiment and look at adjacent spaces where you're at?\nOr do you say, in this period, just stay focused on your core mission right\nnow, which is the core products you're serving today?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe continue to remain focused in making sure that experience is protected and\nour services are coming across to customers in a high-fidelity, high-accuracy\nmanner.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nYes. I think my question might have been touched on at several other places.\nBut as you've seen an acceleration in Q1, particularly as we've come into\nstay-at-home and work-at-home environment, are you also seeing a drop in the\nmarketing costs to acquire those customers, both from the fact that there are\nmore customers coming in the door? But additionally, have other companies\npulled out of marketing channels that have allowed you to now make less\nexpensive options available?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nBoth of those assumptions are correct. I won't go into quantifying each of\nthem versus the other. But yes, there is a higher degree of marketing\nefficiency and a greater yield, and the dollar invested is going much further.\nBut then again, remember, we are not sure of the quality of the cohort that\nwe're acquiring, so we stand ready to ensure that we're engaging with\ncustomers and reinvesting for long-term retention purposes.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nWell, I know you said that there was a little bit of what you think of this\nkind of panic buying or hoarding mentality that people were building up\nsupply. Of your new customers coming in, were they at a similar percentage\nthat were signing up for your Autoship as normal?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nMore or less, yes.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nYes. OK. Thank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Your line\nis open.\n\n **Oliver Wintermantel** \\-- _Evercore ISI -- Analyst_\n\nThanks very much. Yeah. And just on the existing customers that are now\nspending more, is it more ticket or traffic? So in other words, is it more do\nthey spend more, or do they just come more often right now? And the related\nquestion to that is, of the sales, is that mostly consumable? Or do you also\nsee hard goods in pharma sales?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nHi, Oliver, this is Mario. I'll take that one. It's a combination of both. So\nexisting customers buying up, so bigger baskets and also placing more orders.\n\nIn terms of what we're seeing in the mix of what they're buying, it is, as in\nthe past, we see a larger uptick -- a greater percentage of the sales being on\nthe consumable side, and it's the kind of behavior you would expect if you're\nstocking the pantry.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nI can provide some more color there. So you're seeing essentials as No. 1.\nWith also the pet adoption trend that's up, so a lot of new pets being brought\nhome, we're seeing a healthy uptick on the hard goods side, everything that a\npet parent would need to service that need.\n\nAnd then the category that might be really impacted at this time across the\nindustry is truly discretionary spend such as pet tech.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Dylan Carden** \\-- _William Blair and Company -- Analyst_\n\nThanks very much. Just curious, reading some things to suggest things,\nparticularly like fostering and adoption is maybe up in this environment, are\nyou seeing -- of the new customers coming in, can you tell how many of those\nare actually new pet owners as well? And then can you just remind us sort of\nwhat happened in the last recession as per the acceleration in this space,\nsort of what drove that and what maybe you're expecting from here?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nCould you repeat the question, please? We didn't quite catch it.\n\n **Dylan Carden** \\-- _William Blair and Company -- Analyst_\n\nSorry about that. Yeah, just curious if you're seeing any -- of the new\ncustomers coming in, in this environment, if you can tell how many are -- is\nalso new pet owners and if there's any sort of reason to suggest that might be\na stickier long-term customer and then why the industry itself accelerated in\nthe last recession. What was sort of the driving force behind that?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nSo we haven't really gone back to the drawing board and pulled that data. It\nwould be dependent upon customers creating a pet profile and telling us really\nhow many are new pet parents, so it's a little bit harder to sort of really\nget at that right now as we're focused on really handling the demand shock and\nmaking sure that our experience and fulfillment remains intact. On the\nincrease, I mean, the fact that the nature of this business is recurring\nstaple purchases, and during this time, attention and care for pets actually\ngoes up, a combination of all of that is what, in our mind, maintains and\ndrives the spending patterns during times like these.\n\n **Operator**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for the\nquestion-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to management for\nclosing remarks.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThanks all for the continued interest in Chewy. Please stay safe.

Businesses, in a bid to\nshrink operational expenditures, are outsourcing entire payroll services to\nenhance their existing operations.\n\nOrganisations which leverage an in-house team for payroll, time and attendance\nalmost spend 20 per cent more on their Operational Expenditures as compared to\norganisations that outsource the same processes.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of the top trends fuelling the growth of Payroll\nOutsourcing sector-:\n\n **The Rise of Multi-Country Payroll Outsourcing (MCPO)**\n\nMulti-country payroll outsourcing (MCPO) enables businesses to utilize\nplatforms for managing payroll processes across different countries. The MCPO\nsolution comes as a viable option for enterprises with significant overseas\noperations as it offers cloud-based payroll operations by a service provider\nto manage payroll irrespective of an employee's location.\n\nAs SMBs expand their operations into other potential markets, the demand for\nMCPO is set to witness a surge in the coming years.\n\n **Automation**\n\nAnother major trend contributing to the unprecedented growth of the Payroll\nOutsourcing sector is automation. Automated payroll services enable service\nproviders to enhance efficiency and cut on their operational expenditures. A\nlarge number of payroll outsourcing players are now leveraging scalable\ndelivery platforms driven by automation for the deduction, record keeping and\npayment calculation with minimal human involvement.\n\n **Employee Self-Service (ESS)**\n\nEmployee self-service (ESS) is gaining rapid traction in the HR and payroll\nmanagement segment. ESS involves empowering employees with direct access to\ntheir HR and payroll data via mobile applications and software.\n\nEmployees can access and download payroll-related forms, keep track of their\nholidays etc. This results in a more productive and efficient HR and Payroll\noperations resulting in a win-win proposition.\n\n **Real-Time Analytics In Payroll**\n\nThe data analysis of Payroll enables a deeper understanding of business\noperations including staffing, team management and profits.\n\nA significant number of enterprises and organizations leverage payroll\nanalytics to formulate business strategies focused on training, tax\nliabilities and team management across their business landscape.\n\nConstructive payroll analytics, therefore, is expected to be in major demand\nin payroll outsourcing services.\n\n **Data Security**\n\nData security comes as a crucial factor for businesses which can make or break\na contract. Any an organisation which is outsourcing its payroll operations to\na third party the vendor would expect the personal information of its\nemployees to be stored in a secure and encrypted environment.\n\nIt is therefore quintessential for payroll outsourcing providers to strengthen\ntheir approach in ensuring an end to end data security for not only payroll\nprocesses but also for HR, tax, finance and other key functions. It would not\nbe an exaggeration to say that a vendor with the best security mechanism in\nplace will make to the list of top payroll outsourcing service providers in\ncoming years.\n\n **Integrated Platforms For Optimised Management**\n\nThe usage of integrated payroll platforms has emerged as a dominating trend in\nthe payroll outsourcing market. These platforms enable employers and their\nworkforce to seamlessly access their personalised payroll data and instantly\ncommunicate and manage salaries, insurances, commissions, taxes and more. This\nresults in a more transparent environment inside an organisation ensuring\nemployee satisfaction and stability.\n\nAn increasing number of future-ready businesses have either outsourced their\nend to end payroll services or are in advanced conversations to do so in the\nnear future. While no 'one strategy' makes business sense for every\nenterprise, outsourcing payroll cuts on your operational expenditures, and\nempowers you to zero in on your core revenue-generating processes. Outsourcing\npayroll services will not only enable you to secure your data but also avail\nspecialised services for your talented professionals.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190308060624-ENT-\nIndia-Logo-White.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntrepreneurInd\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/EntrepreneurIND\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurind/\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

Some might choose to work as\ncontractors, others as full-time staff, and yet others via freelance\narrangements.\n\nIn short, the [human resource](https://techwireasia.com/2019/11/what-keeps-hr-\nmanagers-from-adopting-innovative-technologies/) (HR) function of businesses\nneeds to be aligned with the changes that happen within an organization.\n\nHowever, these issues are not to be mistaken as drawbacks that businesses may\nface in light of digitalization.\n\nRather, they can be seen as operational gaps or interaction flaws that need to\nbe attended to because these employees may not have the best HR experience.\n\nWhat businesses need to do is to integrate these systems together to enable a\nseamless and digitally-enabled HR function.\n\nThis is especially vital for digitally-reliant employees who generally\nnavigate themselves using technology capabilities - justifying the need to\ndevelop an interconnected, digital HR function that would track changes that\nhappen and respond accordingly.\n\nCognitive technologies, intellectual machines, and robots can be leveraged to\nsignificantly enhance and improve employees [HR\nexperience](https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/address-tax-\nand-payroll-issues-that-come-with-digitalisation).\n\nThough automated, connected systems within a function would still allow\ncustomization of HR capabilities and enable relevant payroll support.\n\nMay it be an employee's tax status, salary changes, payslips, leave\napplication or expense claims, a digitally-enabled HR function can\ndramatically elevate the way changes are managed within a business operation.\n\n[![Informed business decisions will drive greater outcomes.

It follows Access Group\u2019s other recent acquisition of\nPeople, another leader in small business HR software.\n\nBoth of those acquisitions, the release states, will allow Access Group to\nsupport businesses of any size with needs for HR and payroll-related issues.\n\nCoreHR\u2019s software currently serves more than 270 customers, with more than 1\nmillion users accessing its services. The group sees a strong presence across\nfields like government, education, retail, hospitality, leisure, distribution\nand manufacturing, among others.\n\nIt covers people management, payroll, workforce management, recruitment,\ntalent management and more.\n\nGoing forward, those needs will be a part of the Access Workspace platform,\nwith the needs supported as part of the cloud-based system, delivering\nservices that foster communication and collaboration in the workplace,\naccording to the press release.\n\nAccess Group has a dominant foothold in the sector in the U.K. and Ireland,\nboasting revenues in this sector of over 100 million pounds ($129.6 million).\nThe combination of the company\u2019s new assets will result in the formation of\nthe Access People Division. Dean Forbes, currently the CEO of CoreHR, will\nbecome the president of that division.\n\nForbes said in the release that meeting Access Group\u2019s leaders persuaded\nCoreHR that the acquisition would be the best way forward for customers as the\ncompany continues to grow. Forbes said Access Group would be \u201cfully committed\u201d\nto helping enhance the range and depth of CoreHR\u2019s products.\n\nOther recent acquisitions for Access Group, including payroll technology firm\n[Payroll Service\nCompany](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/access-acquisitions-\nbroaden-payroll-software-footprint/), also helped the company bolster its\nservices. Access pointed to a rapidly changing payroll market as a driver\nbehind the takeovers.

Business Writer_\n\n **LONDON (AP)** \u2014 A pandemic forcing everyone to stay home could be the\nperfect moment for online grocery services. In practice, they've been\nstruggling to keep up with a surge in orders, highlighting their limited\nability to respond to an unprecedented onslaught of demand.\n\nAfter panic buying left store shelves stripped of staples like pasta, canned\ngoods and toilet paper, many shoppers quickly found online grocery delivery\nslots almost impossible to come by, too.\n\n\"It's kind of becoming more challenging to put a meal together,\" said Paul\nSmyth, a software engineer who lives near Manchester, England, where the\nonline groceries industry is particularly advanced. He's a longtime customer\nof British online-only supermarket Ocado but hasn't been able to land a slot\nsince he received his last delivery two weeks ago.\n\nThe problem for many delivery services is ramping up staff to pick goods in\nshops and deliver. But for Ocado, a cutting edge service that relies on\nwarehouse robots, significantly increasing deliveries would mean a big\ninvestment in new machinery and warehouses too late to catch the spike in\ndemand.\n\nSmyth said he's starting to run low on meat and frozen goods, but wants to\navoid going to a supermarket because he worries his asthma, diabetes and high\nblood pressure are risk factors if he catches the new coronavirus.\n\n\"I won't be panicking for another week, but if I've got to wait another two\nweeks for a delivery slot it's going to be very close to the bone.\"\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is giving the e-commerce industry a boost but troubles\nat Ocado and other online grocers highlight how hard it is for the industry to\nquickly scale up online delivery.\n\nIn the U.S., grocery shopping had only been slowly migrating online, making up\n3% of the food retail market, according to a report last year by Deutsche\nBank.\n\nAs the crisis hit, delivery orders surged as millions of Americans stayed\nhome. During the week of March 2, even before some cities and states imposed\n\"stay at home\" orders, Instacart, Amazon, and Walmart grocery delivery sales\nall jumped by at least two-thirds from the year before, according to Earnest\nResearch. Instacart, a platform that partners with more than 25,000 stores in\nNorth America, says orders in more recent weeks have surged 150%.\n\nAs a result, customers in hard-hit New York City are waiting days to schedule\ndeliveries that usually take just hours.\n\nIn China, where the outbreak originated early this year, ubiquitous smartphone\nfood apps helped millions get through months of strict lockdown. Even so,\ne-commerce giant Alibaba's supermarket chain Freshippo reportedly recruited\nlaid off restaurant workers for temporary staff as more customers shifted to\nordering by app and average basket sizes jumped in the first half of February.\n\nBritain's online grocery market, one of the world's most advanced, is\nestimated to account for 8.3% of all sales in 2020, according to market\nresearch firm Mintel. Nevertheless, Ocado and the online arms of bricks and\nmortar rivals like Tesco, Sainsbury's and Walmart owned-Asda were all booked\nup. To be fair, they're prioritizing slots for vulnerable customers.\n\nOcado has pioneered online groceries in the U.K. since 2002 with automated\nwarehouse robots and has licensed its technology to other companies including\nKroger. That experience wasn't enough when its website melted down after\ntraffic quadrupled.\n\nThe company battled to get systems back to normal by taking its smartphone app\noffline and stopping new account signups. It temporarily blocked its website,\nthen made all visitors wait in a virtual queue, alienating long-time users.\n\n\"It just felt as if they'd completely abandoned customers,\" said Smyth, 50,\nwho waited as long as four hours online only to find there were no delivery\nslots. Ocado now has a new system to allocate slots but Smyth still hasn't had\nany luck and is getting by with basic items from a local shop.\n\nCEO Melanie Smith emailed customers to tell them demand spiked to 10 times the\nnormal level. Her message came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced\nnew lockdown rules and urged people to use food delivery services.\n\nEvery time the British government announces new measures to fight the virus,\nshe said, \"we see a further extraordinary surge of customers.\"\n\n\"No matter how hard we work, we will not have enough capacity to serve the\nunprecedented levels of demand.\"\n\nOcado operates three warehouses where cube-shaped robots on wheels zip along\nvast grids, picking up crates of soda, teabags, or apples and delivering them\nto \"picking stations.\" There, humans or robot arms put together customer\norders to be delivered by a fleet of vans.\n\nThe company said it handled 343,000 orders per week in the quarter ending\nMarch 1, and sales have since doubled. Analysts note the main factor\ninfluencing growth in an automated system like Ocado's is warehouse capacity.\n\n\"There are only so many of those warehouses you can build,\" said Simon Bowler,\nan analyst at Numis Securities. It takes up to two years for Ocado to build a\nwarehouse, so \"saying today, we're going to build a new warehouse, it doesn't\nsolve the problem here and now.\" A fourth warehouse was destroyed by a fire\nlast year.\n\nTraditional supermarkets have their own less sophisticated online operations,\nusing people to pick items off shelves.\n\nThat is \"a bit easier to flex to sudden huge increases in demand,\" said Bowler\n- you just need to hire more people.\n\nCompanies have started doing that. British supermarket Morrison's is hiring\n2,500 extra drivers and pickers. Amazon is looking for 100,000 more staff,\nwhile Instacart plans to add 300,000 gig workers, more than doubling the\nnumber of people it has picking and delivering groceries.\n\nStill, Instacart's workers have struggled to meet efficiency targets, as\nstores impose distancing rules and business surges.\n\nThat highlights the main downside to human store pickers, Bowler said: They're\n10-15% less cost efficient than robots.\n\nLatest\n\n  * [ ![Fast_Facts_Nancy_Pelosi_0_14141515_ver1.0_640_360.jpg](https://tennessee.cdn-anvilcms.net/media/images/2019/01/21/images/Fast_Facts_Nancy_Pelosi_0_1414.90d0b5c1.fill-600x500-c80.jpg) ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/congress-white-house-reach-high-next-virus-bill/) [ Congress, White House reach high for next virus bill  ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/congress-white-house-reach-high-next-virus-bill/)\n  * [ ![byx.jpeg](https://tennessee.cdn-anvilcms.net/media/images/2020/03/23/images/byx.83d3647e.fill-600x500-c80.jpg) ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/nyc-virus-deaths-exceed-3200-topping-toll-911-attacks/) [ NYC virus deaths exceed 3,200, topping toll for 9/11 attacks  ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/nyc-virus-deaths-exceed-3200-topping-toll-911-attacks/)\n  * [ ![Trump pic original original.jpg](https://tennessee.cdn-anvilcms.net/media/images/2019/07/01/images/Trump_pic_original_original.e8f9df35.fill-600x500-c80.jpg) ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/trump-removes-watchdog-tapped-2t-virus-rescue-oversight/) [ Trump removes watchdog tapped for $2T virus rescue oversight  ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/trump-removes-watchdog-tapped-2t-virus-rescue-oversight/)\n  * [ ![dsadg](https://tennessee.cdn-anvilcms.net/media/images/2020/03/24/images/d42a4e22ee344ff5a9f5061d4869ce.654f776a.fill-600x500-c80.jpg) ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/virus-crisis-cuts-billions-sent-poor-around-world/) [ Virus crisis cuts off billions sent to poor around the world  ](https://www.smithvillereview.com/covid-19-update-hub/virus-crisis-cuts-billions-sent-poor-around-world/)\n\n"}, {"item": "How to Automate Payroll -

BOOKKEEPING  ](https://www.inc.com/bookkeeping)\n\nPayroll Services\n\n#\n\nHow to Automate Payroll\n\nAutomating processes such as time, expense, and project tracking save payroll\nprofessionals an enormous amount of time and effort. Here's a closer look at\nthe benefits of payroll automation and a review of the services available.\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/inc_242211.png)](//www.inc.com/author/staff)\n[By Inc. staff](//www.inc.com/author/staff)\n\nCREDIT: Getty Images\n\n**The**[ **American Payroll Association**](http://www.americanpayroll.org)\n**** (APA) estimates that automation reduces payroll processing costs by as\nmuch as 80 percent, much of that from reducing errors in invoices and\npaychecks. A 2009 study commissioned for APA by the Hackett Group found that\n90 percent of organizations now have paperless payroll distribution because of\nthe advent of direct deposit and payment cards. In addition, the study found\nthat 58 percent of employees nationwide were taking advantage of self-service\nfeatures to enter personal data into [automated payroll\nsystems](https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/choosing-a-payroll-service.html).\n\nOne of the reasons businesses have been moving to automate payroll is\ncompliance with stricter financial regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2003. Such regulation is critical to the future of payroll; however, it can\nmake life a lot more difficult for companies. If a payroll professional allows\npaychecks to be calculated incorrectly, affecting the company's financial\nstatements and confusing stakeholders, it may mean the company will have to\npay penalties. Automated processes, however, are more likely to be\nconsistently performed.\n\nWhen should a small business automate payroll? 'As soon as you have enough\nhourly employees in the company that you can't easily just look and see them\nand see how much they're working,' advises Curt Finch, CEO of\n[Journyx](http://www.journyx.com), a provider of Web-based time, expense, and\nproject tracking solutions.\n\nThe following guide will review the benefits of payroll automation and some of\nthe options for automated payroll solutions or services.\n\n_Dig Deeper:[Scaling Your Business with\nTechnology](https://www.inc.com/managing/articles/201009/gorsage.html)_\n\n### **Benefits of Payroll Automation**\n\nPayroll is a boon to employees but the bane of many a small business owner's\nexistence. On a weekly or bi-weekly basis, business owners or their\naccountants must pour over spreadsheets, making calculations, filling out\ngovernment forms, and cut checks for various taxes and payments and then often\ndeposit those payments into various accounts. If that weren't tedious and\nstressful enough, there are potential legal ramifications that they must worry\nabout if payroll is delayed or if the calculations are wrong.\n\nSo it's no surprise that many businesses opt to use computer software to\ngather and aggregate payroll data, and many also look to outside companies to\nactually process payroll information. A number of software and service\nproviders now offer businesses Web-based cloud computing options, as well.\n\n##\n\n\n\n'The benefits of payroll automation are that you know you're paying people\naccurately, you know that you're in compliance with the law in paying overtime\ncorrectly, and that you can also include in these systems the ability to track\nissues, such as how often people are late,' Finch says. 'This way, you can\nfire someone or give them a warning letter and they can't say you did that\nbecause of some other factor. Here is a system that is color blind.'\n\nAnother benefit is that you know you are paying your taxes correctly. There\nare more than 10,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S., and that's not even\naddressing the fact that many tax laws are in constant flux. Businesses can\nautomate their tax filing as part of payroll automation to meet tight\ndeadlines and avoid penalties for non-compliance so that employee tax filing\nis no longer overwhelming.\n\nPayroll automation offers businesses a variety of other benefits, too. It can\ncut down on the process of data gathering, information processing, and\ndisbursement and reporting. Automation can cut down on printing costs, such as\npay slips, which with a number of solutions can be checked by employees\nonline. It's easier to add new employees and make salary adjustments or record\nwhen an employee quits or is terminated. If tax rates change, your tax tables\ncan also be automatically updated in a computer-based system.\n\n_Dig Deeper:[Office Automation](https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/office-\nautomation.html)_\n\n### **Automated Payroll Options**\n\nTo many small business owners, payroll is a headache. To make it go away, and\nstill pay employees and tax collectors on an accurate and timely basis, there\nare a number of ways to automate the process. These methods include deploying\npayroll software in-house, moving to a Web-based system that lets employees\nenter much of their own data, or outsourcing the function to a third-party.\n\n**Payroll Software**  \nA staple among small businesses, Intuit's\n[QuickBooks](http://www.quickbooks.com) offers a payroll module to add to your\nexisting accounting software. Priced between $16 and $22 per month, Enhanced\nPayroll can help you pay employees, calculate taxes, and fill out necessary\nforms. Peachtree, a small-business accounting package sold by [Sage\nSoftware](http://www.sage.com/), offers an in-house payroll module that can\nhelp you automate payroll, in addition to automating tax payments, e-filing,\nand direct deposit.\n\n**Online Payroll Services**  \nA growing number of companies now provide Web-based payroll solutions so that\nemployees and your accountant can work together to generate accurate paychecks\nand tax payments. Some also provide full-service options so that small\nbusinesses can outsource their payroll and payroll tax processing.\n\n  * **Intuit Online Payroll** doesn't require QuickBooks or any other accounting software to help generate a small business's payroll.\n  * [**XpressPayroll**](https://www.xpresspayroll.com/)[ ](http://www.xpresspayroll.com), the small-business service of CompuPay, offers an online payroll solution that can be accessed round-the-clock.\n  * **Sage MicrOpay** offers businesses with fewer than 50 employees a full-service payroll outsourcing service.\n  * [**SurePayroll**](http://www.surepayroll.com/)[ ](http://www.surepayroll.com), which was purchased in December by Paychex, is an online-based full-service solution that allows 24/7 online access-;even from mobile devices-;in addition to PIN-protected security features and a secure call-in system.\n  * **[ADP](http://www.adp.com/solutions/employer-services/payroll/small-business-payroll.aspx)** , a major data processing services provider, offers three different full-service payroll packages for different price points and needs.\n  * [**Paychex**](http://smallbusiness.paychex.com/payroll/), meanwhile, offers small business flexible management options to let businesses submit payroll by phone, fax, or online.\n\n'Time is money,' says Finch. 'The big advantage of a payroll automation system\nis this: what are you doing if your payroll is not automated? You're getting\nthis all on paper or e-mailing around Excel spreadsheets. That's time\nconsuming and there is a much higher chance of errors in the calculations. And\nif you pay people incorrectly, you can face enormous penalties.'\n\nSee our list of [best payroll services](https://www.inc.com/finance/best-\npayroll-service.html)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Recommended Resources**\n\n[The American Payroll Association](http://www.americanpayroll.org/)\n\n[Paperless Pay Calculator](http://www.payperk.com/APA/)\n\n[The Incredible Shrinking Finance\nDepartment](http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14533064?f=search)\n\n[Accountants Head to the\nCloud](http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14484960?f=search)\n\n##\n\n\n\nEditorial Disclosure: Inc. writes about products and services in this and\nother articles.

There\nare enormous amounts of money changing hands and inconsistent and often\noutdated security measures.\n\nWhile payroll security may be getting better, the speed of change is still too\nslow to prevent ongoing data breaches. There is enough evidence to suggest\nthat payroll remains a preferred target.\n\nIn the past year alone, payroll has been at the heart of numerous breaches,\neither as a result of hack attacks or human error - often a combination of\nboth. Last month, a thief broke into the car of a Facebook payroll employee\nand [stole a hard disc](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/payroll-\ndata-29000-facebook-employees-stolen-report-a-13509) containing the names,\nbank account numbers, and salary details of 29,000 Facebook employees.\nMeanwhile attackers in Tallahassee [stole half a million\ndollars](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/payroll-data-29000-facebook-\nemployees-stolen-report-a-13509) in city payroll by redirecting deposits of\npaychecks belonging to municipal workers.\n\nAlso, officials at the Cheyenne Regional M[edical Center (CRMC) in Wyoming\n](https://www.smartdatacollective.com/10-helpful-ways-to-ensure-data-centric-\ncybersecurity/)[discovered a hack ](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/data-\nof-15m-patients-impacted-retrieved-in-lifelabs-cyberattack)[aimed at the\npayroll data of its patients. Accounts at the center contained large amounts\nof ](https://www.smartdatacollective.com/10-helpful-ways-to-ensure-data-\ncentric-cybersecurity/)sensitive data in additional to private health\ninformation, including credit cards and financial data.  \n  \nMore incidents are sure to follow. In fact, the number may already be much\ngreater that people realize. The CRMC hack was only discovered five months\nafter the fact. How many hacks on payroll have gone completely unnoticed?\n\n**Payroll as the Soft Underbelly of Payments**  \nPayroll remains vulnerable, in part, because the field has been slow adapt to\nthe new reality. With so much value placed on absolute accuracy, companies are\nreluctant to make the large-scale changes to stay up to date in data\nprotection.\n\nWhile fintech companies are offering automated solutions in many areas of\nfinance, payroll has remained one of the last bastions of the old way of doing\nthings. In large companies with thousands of employees, the payroll process is\nvirtually identical to what it has been for many years, and the process for\nabout 85% of the workforce remains largely manual.\n\nA payroll department processes enormous amounts of spreadsheets. Companies\nmight use software suites to process the numbers, but they are still entered\nmanually. Some companies still do payroll on paper.\n\nThe manual process has two primary vulnerabilities: the first and most obvious\nis that with any manual process, it is impossible to eliminate human error.\nThat means there will be errors in payroll, and there will be errors in\nhandling the data. The errors in payroll can harm a company in the area of\ntrust between employee and employer. The errors in handling data can have much\nlarger ramifications if the data gets into the wrong hands.\n\nThe second vulnerability of a manual payroll process is the absence of a clear\nand secure channel for transferring data. As many phishing attempts and\nattacks take place this year, hackers use lookalike pages to take advantage of\nthe intense back and forth between accountants and their clients.\n\nThe issue is complicated even further when a company has employees overseas. A\nglobal payroll is even more complex as a manual process because it then has to\ndeal with multiple languages, reporting styles, currencies, tax codes, and\nemployment laws.\n\n**Startups Showing the Way Forward**  \nWith technology advancing at lightning speed, it is only a matter of time\nbefore payroll joins the workforce revolution already underway. The modern\noffice is growing increasingly automated and increasingly global, and\ncompanies are increasingly turning to digital office assistants - bots capable\nof performing routine and repetitive tasks - to save time and effort.\n\nNot surprisingly a number of fintech start-ups see the current moment as ripe\nfor disruption, using SaaS technology to offer secure payroll solutions that\nare easy to install and intuitive to use. Large companies [have been reluctant\n](https://papayaglobal.com/blog/enterprise-companies-payroll-pain-points-and-\nsolutions/)to adopt solutions that are hard to install and sync with the\naccounting systems already in place at their companies.\n\nNew automated solutions are cloud-based, so they fit seamlessly with the\nlegacy accounting programs that are commonly being used. The cloud also allows\nstartups to offer their products on a subscription level rather than as\nsoftware that sits on computers. The SaaS approach lowers the risk for a\ncompany with a large workforce. It also eliminates the need for companies to\nhandle their own maintenance. The SaaS provider also ensures the product is\nconstantly upgraded to keep up with advances in standards.\n\nThese startups present the latest weapon in the ongoing war between hackers\nand payments. As long as there is money moving from place to place, [thieves\nwill try to get](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-\nmakes-80-arrests-over-46/) it. Payroll has served as a soft target for too\nlong. The workforce is changing, and that's sweeping payroll into the modern\nage.\n\n* * *\n\n_Ryan Kh is an entrepreneur & startup investor.

One \"high-\nranking team official\" told [Ben\nGolliver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/21/coronavirus-could-\ncost-nba-1-billion-bring-about-record-salary-cap-drop/\n\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/21/coronavirus-could-cost-\nnba-1-billion-bring-about-record-salary-cap-drop/\") of the _Washington Post_\nthat the NBA could lose more than $1.2 billion (!) if it ends up having to\ncancel the 2020 playoffs.\n\nToday In: [SportsMoney](https://www.forbes.com/sportsmoney)\n\n  * [\n\n### EXCLUSIVE: FC Barcelona Striker\u2019s Uncle Files For $50 Million IPO: \u2018We\nWant To Create 100,000 New Millionaires\u2019\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpettigrove/2020/04/08/exclusive-fc-\nbarcelona-strikers-uncle-files-for-50-million-ipo-we-want-to-\ncreate-100000-new-millionaires/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Mark Cuban Will Continue Paying His Employees Amid Coronavirus-Induced\nEconomic Downturn\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2020/04/08/mark-cuban-continue-\npaying-employees-coronavirus-economic-downturn/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Report: UFC 249 To Take Place At Tachi Palace In California\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2020/04/07/report-ufc-249-to-\ntake-place-at-tachi-palace-in-california/)\n\nAccording to ESPN's [Adrian\nWojnarowski](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28919521/nba-raise-credit-\nline-550m-sources-say \"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28919521/nba-raise-\ncredit-line-550m-sources-say\"), the NBA plans to provide \"financial\nprojections on three primary scenarios: shutting down the season, restarting\nwith no fans in arenas and playing playoff games with fans.\" Regardless of\nwhich path it ultimately chooses, any loss of revenue \"will be reflected in\nnext season's salary cap and the players' share of basketball-related income,\"\nWojnarowski added.\n\nThe league bases its salary cap upon the projected amount of BRI for the\nupcoming season, and it typically uses BRI from the previous season as a\nbaseline. Since the ongoing shutdown figures to significantly affect 2019-20\nBRI, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association could instead\nagree to throw out that baseline and set the cap using an actual projection of\n2020-21 BRI. But if they don't, a 2020-21 salary-cap decline of \"$10 million\nto $15 million is not outside the realm of possibility,\" according to Bleacher\nReport's [Ken Berger](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2880688-nbas-\ncoronavirus-hiatus-could-mean-chaos-for-leagues-economic-structure\n\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2880688-nbas-coronavirus-hiatus-could-\nmean-chaos-for-leagues-economic-structure\").\n\nSuch a drop would have huge financial ramifications for the Sixers.\n\nThe Sixers already have nearly $114.9 million in guaranteed salaries on their\nbooks next season, and they figure to pick up cheap team options for Furkan\nKorkmaz ($1.8 million) and Norvel Pelle ($1.5 million). That alone would put\nthem at nearly $118.2 million, or $3.2 million over the projected $115 million\nsalary cap and only $20.8 million below the projected $139 million luxury-tax\nthreshold.\n\nThat $118.2 million figure doesn't even take into account All-Star point guard\nBen Simmons, who signed a five-year max extension [this past\nJuly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2019/07/15/how-ben-simmons-\nextension-affects-the-sixers-long-term-financial-outlook\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2019/07/15/how-ben-simmons-\nextension-affects-the-sixers-long-term-financial-outlook\"). The value of that\nextension is based on a percentage of the salary cap, so the Sixers may end up\ngetting a significant discount on Simmons if the cap plummets in 2020-21.\n\nUnder a $115 million cap, Simmons would earn $28.75 million in 2020-21, and\nthe full value of his five-year extension would be $166.75 million. If the cap\nremains at $109.14 million (as it is in 2019-20), he'd earn roughly $27.3\nmillion next year and $158.3 million over the life of the extension. If the\ncap drops to an even $100 million, he'd earn $25 million next year and $145\nmillion over the life of the extension.\n\nThe value of Simmons' extension could also rise if he gets named to an All-NBA\nteam this season. He would earn 28 percent of the salary cap if he's on the\nAll-NBA third team, 29 percent if he's on the All-NBA second team and 30\npercent if he's on the All-NBA first team, per\n[Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/\n\"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/\"). While\nhis back injury coming out of the All-Star break may have jeopardized his All-\nNBA candidacy, that adds another degree of uncertainty with regard to how much\nhe'll earn next season and beyond.\n\nWith Simmons earning $28.75 million next season under a $115 million cap, the\nSixers would have $146.9 million in salary commitments. Add one incomplete\nroster charge of $946,543\u2014which would be the bare minimum they could pay any\nplayer next season\u2014and they'd be nearly $8.9 million over the $139 million\nluxury-tax threshold, which would cost them roughly $14.3 million in tax.\n\nAssuming they pick up the options for Korkmaz (a lock) and Pelle (more likely\nthan not), that's the absolute least they'd owe in tax, barring trades.\nHowever, their payroll is certain to swell even more.\n\nIf they receive the Oklahoma City Thunder's top-20-protected first-round\npick\u2014which would happen if the regular season does not resume\u2014that would add\nroughly $2.5 million to their books unless they sell or trade the pick or use\nit on a draft-and-stash player. Spending any portion of their taxpayer mid-\nlevel exception would cause their tax bill to rise even further. And they\nfigure to round out their roster with a handful of players on veteran-minimum\ncontracts, too.\n\nEven in the bare-minimum scenario\u2014picking up options for Korkmaz and Pelle,\nrostering only 12 players and signing a rookie to a $946,543 minimum\ncontract\u2014the Sixers' tax bill could _still_ spiral out of hand quickly\ndepending on how far the cap falls. The savings they get on Simmons' extension\nwon't come close to making up for their ballooning tax payment.\n\nIf the cap does decline to this extent, it could influence the Sixers' team-\nbuilding strategy moving forward. Since the tax rate [rises\nsubstantially](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q18\n\"http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q18\") as teams go further over the\nthreshold, an increasingly bloated luxury-tax bill might cause the Sixers to\nrethink bringing back their entire starting five next season. It could affect\ntheir willingness to spend the taxpayer mid-level exception or keep OKC's\nfirst-round pick, too.\n\nThe Sixers won't be the only team in that boat if the 2020-21 cap does\nplummet. The Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics are [all\nstaring down](https://earlybirdrights.com/salary-cap/\n\"https://earlybirdrights.com/salary-cap/\") the possibility of facing hefty\nluxury-tax bills, too. As such, the NBA and NBPA both have incentive to agree\non a 2020-21 cap figure that averts a significant one-year decline. Otherwise,\nteams may be far less willing (or able) to spend money on free agents this\noffseason.\n\nSettling upon a 2020-21 cap figure is one of many thorny issues the NBA and\nNBPA must collectively bargain over the next few months as the coronavirus\npandemic continues to unfold. The Sixers and other projected taxpayers can\nonly hope the two sides reach an agreement that doesn't involve a drastic one-\nyear drop, or their tax bills will balloon accordingly.\n\n  \n\n_Unless otherwise noted, all stats via  _[ _NBA.com_](http://stats.nba.com/\n\"http://stats.nba.com/\") _  or _[ _Basketball\nReference_](http://www.basketball-reference.com/ \"http://www.basketball-\nreference.com/\") _.

We love payroll\nsimply because we love, and need, to be paid for our work efforts. But when\nthose work efforts are on the other side of the paycheck, it\u2019s not as much\nfun.\n\nOver the years, payroll has evolved. Yes, at its core it\u2019s still gross to net,\nbut it has grown beyond just keeping track of rates and hours. Today\u2019s payroll\nsystems have expanded to include essential human resources functions, from the\ninitial interview to the exit of the employee. Additionally, many payroll\nservice bureaus have gone beyond just cutting checks and making direct\ndeposits, offering such amenities as insurance and pension services. As we do\nannually, we surveyed seven providers of payroll and ancillary services to see\nwhere they are at the moment, and where they think the payroll industry is\nmoving.\n\n  \n**People are the focus**\n\nPayroll itself is a fairly generic application except in the instance of\nvertical markets such as construction. Most payroll systems today allow for an\nindividual employee to have more than a single job title and pay rate.\nSpecialized reporting, such as union reports, is also pretty standard among\ntoday\u2019s payroll service bureaus and software suppliers.\n\nBut increasingly, managers are realizing that people are a company\u2019s most\nvaluable resource. And keeping track of them is often the responsibility of\nthe human resources department. As a result, many payroll suppliers have added\nthis capability to the mix, both as an integrated part of the payroll services\nthey provide, or as an important adjunct to the payroll system.\n\nADP is one vendor that got into HR and other services early in the game.\nAccording to Erron Stark, division vice president of channels, \u201cJust like\naccountants do much more than accounting, ADP does much more than just\npayroll. For 70 years, we have been designing better ways to work through our\ncutting-edge HR, talent, time management, benefits and payroll products and\nservices.\u201d\n\nStark continued, \u201cTo help employers build the right team, we can provide\nresources such as ADP recruiters, access to ZipRecruiter technology in our RUN\nPowered by ADP platform, customizable job descriptions, interviewing\nchecklists, candidate assessment forms, background checks, and a seamless\ndigital onboarding tool. To help employers craft a competitive job offer and\ncompensation package, ADP DataCloud and Compensation Benchmarking, Powered by\nADP DataCloud, offer access to current pay data that can be filtered by title,\nindustry, location and employee size.\u201d\n\nPaychex is another vendor that offers all-around HRT services in addition to\npayroll. As Tom Hammond, vice president of corporate strategy and product\nmanagement, told us, \u201cPaychex Flex is an all-in-one HR solution that provides\nscalable solutions for recruiting and applicant tracking, time and attendance,\nhiring and onboarding, insurance, payroll processing, health benefits\nadministration, HR record management (HRIS), performance management, learning\nmanagement, and retirement services.\u201d\n\nNot all of the vendors we surveyed offer ancillary software applications that\ncomplement their payroll offerings. For example, AccountantsWorld doesn\u2019t\ndirectly offer HR software, but does have an API that lets other HR solution\nproviders integrate with its Payroll Relief, according to CEO Chandra\nBhansali. This extends Payroll Relief\u2019s capabilities into health benefits,\ninsurance, workman\u2019s comp, and other offerings.\n\n  \n**Put \u2018er there, partner**\n\nThe vendors we surveyed vary from offering payroll services to the clients of\naccounting firms, to providing software that lets firms run their own payroll\nservice bureau. For example, Thomson Reuters covers the bases with two\npayroll-related applications. \u201cAccounting CS Payroll provides advanced payroll\nprocessing software for time entry, paycheck delivery, and tax compliance\ndelivery,\u201d Louie Calvin, proposition strategy lead for large firms, told us.\n\u201cBatch-oriented and fully automated, it quickly performs the payroll\ncalculations for you, and cross-client processing means you can significantly\nincrease the number of clients you serve, without hiring more staff. This is\nthe solution for start-to-finish payroll for in-house processors.\u201d Thomson\nReuters also offers myPay Solutions: \u201cThis provides firms easy and efficient\npayroll services without the liability or hassle of processing. Implementing a\nstreamlined payroll processing partnership with a trusted advisor like Thomson\nReuters enables them to empower staff, focus on client relationships, and\nenhance advisory services centered around helping their clients make better\nbusiness decisions. The firm can focus on the services that get greater ROI or\non what they do best\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Gusto is strictly a service bureau. Spokesperson Rick Chen\nsaid that nearly 5,000 accounting and bookkeeping firms across the U.S.\npartner with Gusto to serve small and midsized businesses, many as a part of\npremium business consulting or outsourced or \u201cvirtual\u201d CFO services.\n\n\u201cGusto partners receive free payroll for their accounting firms, \u2018white-glove\u2019\nservice to migrate their clients onto Gusto, and access to a dedicated\naccountant support team and marketing services, such as inclusion in the Gusto\nPartner Directory, to promote their firm. Partners also earn revenue and\ndiscounts for their clients,\u201d said Chen.\n\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/d2/ca/fa9f3f3444f9ac16195e9561698c/at-112918-payrollin2019.png)SurePayroll\nis another service bureau that partners with accounting firms, according to\nCPA sales manager Jorge Lopez: \u201cSurePayroll provides accounting firms two\npartnership options to provide their clients with a payroll option and\nincrease their bottom line. Neither requires upfront investment and both\nenable firms to run payroll and accurately collect and file federal, state and\nlocal taxes for their clients. By referring small-  \nbusiness clients to SurePayroll, firms can give clients an easy and secure\npayroll solution and have real-time access to their clients\u2019 payroll reports,\nfree of charge. SurePayroll compensates partner firms for each referral.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming a reseller partner allows accountants to grow their business by\noffering SurePayroll\u2019s online payroll service right from their own website,\u201d\nLopez continued. \u201cAdditionally, firms have the option of white-labeling the\nSurePayroll solution, giving their clients a fully branded online portal that\ncan be accessed from the firm\u2019s website. SurePayroll also provides our\naccountant partners with dedicated support from an experienced accountant care\nteam, and we guarantee our payroll tax-filing services. If an accountant or\ntheir client receives a notice from the IRS, or any other tax agency, based on\na filing that SurePayroll made, we\u2019ll work with the agency directly to help\nresolve the issue on their behalf. And if we are at fault, we will pay all the\nassociated penalties and fines.\u201d\n\nNot every vendor has elaborate partnership opportunities, but most offer at\nleast some way that an accountant can work with them. For example, Patriot\nSoftware offers a partnership opportunity with accountants and bookkeepers who\nprocess payroll for clients. Accountants and bookkeepers become \u201cCertified\nAdvisors\u201d and receive the benefit of wholesale pricing as well as enhanced\nsoftware features such as \u201cumbrella logins\u201d and \u201cmulti-users,\u201d according to\nmarketing manager Michele Bossart.\n\n  \n**Providing a portal**\n\nToday\u2019s employees and employers require immediate access to payroll\ninformation. So do accounting firms, especially when that data pertains to\ntheir clients. One way to achieve this is through the use of portals.\n\n\u201cGusto offers small-business owners and payroll administrators access to a\ndashboard which serves as a source of truth for their business,\u201d according to\nChen. \u201cThey can analyze reports about employee benefits, employee engagement,\nemployee records, payroll and relevant financial or practice management data\nsuch as cash flow or expenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccountants and employees are also covered,\u201d Chen continued. \u201cAccountants\nhave a partner dashboard where they can manage their complete book of\nbusiness. They can run payroll for all of their clients with one login and\nclick, view upcoming deadlines, and access and administer employee benefits\nand human resources tools for their clients. And employees have lifetime\naccounts with Gusto, so they can access their employee handbooks, pay history\n(i.e., paystubs) and Forms W-2 from their secure document vault. They can also\ne-sign any essential documents, such as their Forms I-9 and W-4, easily,\nconveniently and securely \u2014 allowing new hires to self-onboard, even before\ntheir start date.\u201d\n\nAccountantsWorld\u2019s Payroll Relief also offers portals for accountants and\ntheir clients. According to Bhansali, \u201cThe firm portal is an integral\ncomponent of Payroll Relief. Accountants log into Payroll Relief though a firm\nportal independently or through their website. We also offer client portals\nfor data entry, and have a mobile app for employees to view paystubs and\ndownload W2s.\u201d\n\nSurePayroll is another vendor that provides its accountant partners with a\nstreamlined, secure dashboard that enables them to manage client payroll and\naccess reports. \u201cAdditionally, we also provide a portal for a firm\u2019s clients\nto use \u2014 providing the payroll services to their small-business clients (and\ntheir employees). Our partners also have the ability to white-label the\npayroll portal, allowing for their brand to be presented to their clients,\u201d\nLopez said.\n\n  \n**Bringing payroll to the back office**\n\nThe past several years have seen an increasing trend toward tying payroll to\nother back-office applications such as accounting. We surveyed our vendors to\nsee how they are implementing this important synergy and the benefits of doing\nso. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to offer real-time data integration capabilities with leading\naccounting software packages, including Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Online and\nXero, and are continuously working to enhance these offerings,\u201d Hammond said.\n\u201cRecent updates include enhancing the import functionality and onboarding\nprocesses, as well as providing accountants the ability to do accruals. We\nprovide a bundled service with this integration \u2014 included at no additional\ncost to the accountant or business owner.\u201d\n\nAnd Patriot Software addresses this integration by offering both payroll and\naccounting software. \u201cOur payroll software integrates seamlessly with our\nonline accounting software,\u201d Bossart said. \u201cOne benefit of this seamless\nintegration is the convenience of accessing both the accounting and payroll\n(and time and attendance) software under one login.\u201d\n\n  \n**A chance for something new**\n\nConsidering how far payroll services have come in the recent past, we wondered\nwhat trends we might see in the near future. \u201cPeople now expect to be paid\noutside of typical payroll cycles or schedules,\u201d said Gusto\u2019s Chen. \u201cGusto\nlaunched Flexible Pay, a new feature that enables employees to choose when\nthey want to get paid \u2014 independent of their employer\u2019s pay or payroll\nschedule.\u201d\n\nADP\u2019s Stark agreed: \u201cAs the gig economy continues to grow, the need for better\ntools to organize, manage and pay freelancers and contractors is also growing.\nWorkmarket, an ADP company, is a freelance management system that helps\nemployers with hiring skilled professionals from a pre-vetted talent pool,\nautomating low-value tasks that save time and increase efficiency. A related\ntrend to the growing \u2018on-demand\u2019 workforce is the desire for \u2018on-demand\u2019 and\nelectronic pay options. In a world of rideshare and food delivery apps,\ntoday\u2019s workers are also looking to be paid faster, no longer willing to wait\na week or two. Wisely by ADP and DailyPay on ADP Marketplace are some of the\nways ADP addresses these trends in pay today.\u201d\n\nThomson Reuters\u2019 Calvin went into more detail with how he sees the payroll and\nHR trends developing: \u201cBusinesses have more success attracting and retaining\nemployees when they offer the convenience of digital onboarding, online\npayroll tools to collect time, and time clock information. Payroll providers\nmust offer the same online, anywhere/anytime, paperless delivery tools, so we\nsee more firms investing in the tools to offer these to clients. Also, new\nlaws and regulations, such as mandatory sick pay, state and local minimum wage\nrules, the Affordable Care Act, and more are making payroll difficult for\nbusinesses to handle on their own without professional assistance. This has\nresulted in more firms and businesses outsourcing to ensure the accuracy and\ntimeliness of their payroll.\u201d\n\nPaychex\u2019s Hammond added, \u201cThe evolving regulatory environment will continue to\nimpact payroll in the foreseeable future. As the federal government looks to\nreduce the regulatory pressures on business, state and local governments are\nintroducing their own regulatory measures at a fevered pace \u2014 meaning that\nit\u2019s more difficult than ever for business owners to keep up with ever-\nchanging HR and compliance demands. Accountants need a trusted payroll and HR\nprovider who\u2019s connected to every legislative agency, a trusted partner who\ncan help them navigate the complexities of doing business today.\u201d\n\nThomson Reuters also has its eye on the future. \u201cMany new payroll enhancements\nand product needs we are currently working on or keeping a close eye on\ninclude reacting to those proposed changes when the IRS finalizes the 2020\nW-4. This will have a big impact on those in the payroll services business,\u201d\nCalvin said. \u201cThe importance of intuitive, beautiful client experience, and\ncollaboration tools are important for all in the business of payroll and this\nwill be a priority for Thomson Reuters to improve that experience.\u201d\n\nJust how quickly the payroll industry and accounting firms move in these\ndirections will be interesting to watch, and the improvements and enhancements\nhopefully will increase the benefits of firms offering payroll services, or\nworking with vendors that provide these, in a service bureau environment.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88b5678/2147483647/strip/true/crop/107x107+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdb%2Fb1%2F91a9ca83462d9fc56017236f38b7%2Ftedneedleman1.jpg)\n](https://www.accountingtoday.com/author/ted-needleman)\n\n[Ted Needleman](https://www.accountingtoday.com/author/ted-needleman)\n\nContributing editor, Accounting Today\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1831529093792889&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still&text=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still)\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still&mini=true&title=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still&summary=From%20human%20resources%20capabilities%20to%20portals%20and%20more%2C%20vendors%20are%20moving%20forward.&source=Accounting%20Today)\n  * [ Email ](mailto:?body=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still%0A%0AFrom%20human%20resources%20capabilities%20to%20portals%20and%20more%2C%20vendors%20are%20moving%20forward.)\n  * [Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\))\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare Close extra sharing options\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1831529093792889&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still&text=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still)\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still&mini=true&title=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still&summary=From%20human%20resources%20capabilities%20to%20portals%20and%20more%2C%20vendors%20are%20moving%20forward.&source=Accounting%20Today)\n  * [ Email ](mailto:?body=Payroll%20never%20stands%20still%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.accountingtoday.com%2Fnews%2Fpayroll-never-stands-still%0A%0AFrom%20human%20resources%20capabilities%20to%20portals%20and%20more%2C%20vendors%20are%20moving%20forward.)\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * [Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\))\n\n[Reprint](https://info.wrightsmedia.com/source-media-licensing-and-reprints)\n\nFor reprint and licensing requests for this article, [click\nhere](https://info.wrightsmedia.com/arizent-licensing-and-reprints).\n\n## Tags\n\n[Payroll software](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/payroll-\nsoftware)[Payroll](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/payroll)[Payroll\nservices](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/payroll-services)[Employee\nbenefits](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/employee-benefits)[HR\nTechnology](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/hr-technology)[Benefits\ntechnology](https://www.accountingtoday.com/tag/benefits-technology)\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * [Artificial intelligence ](https://www.accountingtoday.com/artificial-intelligence)\n\n[AI-driven bot 'Sophie' answers coronavirus-related\nquestions](https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/ai-driven-bot-sophie-answers-\ncoronavirus-related-questions)\n\nThe program is designed to stop the spread of misinformation, answering basic\nquestions about vaccines and testing.\n\nBy [Ranica Arrowsmith](https://www.accountingtoday.com/author/ranica-\narrowsmith)\n\n5h ago\n\n  * [South Dakota v.

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/alight-pulls-\nvirtual-assistant-tech-into-payroll/) __\n\nPayroll technology firm Alight Solutions is rolling out a virtual assistant to\nhelp payroll managers automate various tasks.\n\nIn a [press\nrelease](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191002005573/en/Alight-\nSolutions-launches-artificial-intelligence-drive-payroll) late last week,\nAlight announce the launch of Eloise, its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered\nvirtual assistant for payroll officials that aggregates and analyzes data. The\nanalysis can be deployed to detect anomalies and reference past anomalies to\nguide payroll managers with future predictions.\n\nThese features offer \"automated paycheck anomaly detection and correction,\"\nthe company explained, allowing Eloise to analyze past payroll data to\nidentify errors, correct them and make recommendations for payroll managers to\nmake their own corrections. The technology also continuously audits [payroll\ndata](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/salarium-payroll-\nexperience-fraud-errors/) to identify any potential inaccuracies from dropped\nfiles, calculation mishaps or human errors.\n\nEloise can warn payroll managers of an anomaly in data entry and offers a\ndigital checklist for payroll processors to promote accuracy and data\ninsights.

__\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n__August 20, 2018 Posted by  [China Briefing](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/author/china-briefing/ \"View all posts by China Briefing\")\nWritten by  [ Bradley Dunseith ](https://www.dezshira.com/personnel/bradley-\ndunseith.html) Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nAdvances in automation are forcing businesses to reimagine their human\nresources (HR) and payroll processing workflows. Contrary to popular\nperceptions, automation will not replace employees, but rather compliment\nemployee\u2019s creative and critical skills \u2013 empowering them to be more\nproductive.\n\nBusinesses can introduce automation into their organization through simple,\npractical applications that mechanize routine, monotonous tasks. Not only will\nthis improve an organization's level of productivity, but it will also prime\nboth a business and its employees to be ready for further innovations in\nautomation.\n\n## Changing the automation narrative\n\nAutomation has traditionally been associated with manufacturing and assembly.\nHowever, innovations in [artificial intelligence](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/2017/08/07/ai-china-ai-can-optimize-operations.html) (AI)\nand deep learning have widened the reach and scope of automation so that its\npotential can be felt from shop floors to head offices.\n\n#### [Related News](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/2017/10/30/it-\nsolutions-improving-efficiency-accuracy-and-transparency-in-payroll-\nprocessing-in-china.html)\n\n  * #### [IT Solutions for Payroll Processing in China](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/2017/10/30/it-solutions-improving-efficiency-accuracy-and-transparency-in-payroll-processing-in-china.html)\n\nUnfortunately, workforces often express anxiety and even hostility towards\ntechnology\u2019s growing reach \u2013 often, this is because of cynical, yet dominant,\nnarratives associated with technological advances that posit images of [mass\nlayoffs](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/2016/03/17/china-manufacturing-\nlay-offs.html) and impossible learning curves. Contrary to popular belief,\ncurrent automation regimes in HR and payroll are more likely to help human\nemployees work than replace them.\n\nAccording to a recent study of businesses in Asia Pacific by Willis Towers\nWatson, two thirds of employers believe that the goal of automation is to\naugment individual performance. Automation can help maximize employee\nproductivity most directly not in information technology (IT) \u2013 as is commonly\nassumed \u2013 but in HR and payroll.\n\nBoth [HR and payroll](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-\nresource-administration) demand a combination of creative thinking and\nmundane, routinized work. This combination is not always mutually inclusive\nand can hamper an employee\u2019s ability to effectively focus on tasks that\nrequire analytical thinking and problem solving.\n\nAutomating and streamlining some of these processes frees an employee\u2019s time,\nproviding the space necessary to effectively problem solve and tackle complex\ntasks. Free from mundane, time intensive processes, many companies are\nbeginning to treat their HR departments as profit centers.\n\n## Preparing for automation\n\nTwo major misconceptions about automating business processes is that they will\neither require a major overhaul of an entire IT system or that the software\nwill not be affordable to small and medium sized businesses.\n\nIn fact, many HR and payroll applications can easily integrate into existing\nIT infrastructure. Many professional services firms that offer [payroll and HR\nsupport and consultancy](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-\nresource-administration) also have the capacity to implement [cost-effective\nIT solutions](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-technology-\nsolutions). Getting IT, payroll, and HR support from the same provider means a\nmore integrated system with comprehensive troubleshooting and analytical\nreporting.\n\nAlternatively, businesses can explore migrating their on-premise servers and\nbusiness processes onto the internet through a \u2018[cloud](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/2018/05/07/cloud-technology-china-businesses-need-\nknow.html)\u2019. Though cloud migration is a significant internal change, it will\nsave businesses money in the long term \u2013 allowing them to adapt to new\ntechnologies more organically and without expensive upfront investments into\nphysical infrastructure and hardware.\n\n## A practical approach to automation\n\nTo provide a clearer picture of what automated HR and payroll functions could\nlook like for business, we asked Thomas Zhang, IT director of [Dezan Shira &\nAssociates](https://www.dezshira.com), to explain several important, user-\nfriendly applications businesses first look to when embracing automation.\n\nZhang is an IT expert who has overseen the development of Dezan Shira\u2019s cloud-\nbased integrated HR and payroll system Asia Admin.\n\n### **Automated payroll systems**\n\nAn automated payroll system should be able to automatically calculate\nemployees\u2019 payroll data and generate reports on this information for\nmanagement. A data verification mechanism should be inbuilt to the\napplication\u2019s algorithm.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-\ntechnology-solutions)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Information Technology](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-technology-solutions)\n\nSuch an application would save internal staff from having to manually fill in\nspreadsheets on a regular basis \u2013 a tedious though time consuming task with a\nhigh margin for human error. Reducing mistakes in payroll processing minimizes\nthe risk of violating local regulations.\n\n### Automated HR\n\nAn automated HR system should be able to automatically process and standardize\nemployee information without having to re-enter it manually across multiple\nplatforms. This is of particular importance when dealing with offices that\noperate in multiple languages.\n\nAn automated HR also means simpler data collection \u2013 enabling staff to submit\nindividual data on a self-service tool - as well as easily generated reports\nand employee profiles for management. HR applications should provide single\nportals for submitted, receiving and approving employee requests with built in\nnotifications for both the supervisor and the employee.\n\n### Integrating HR and payroll systems\n\nIntegrating HR and payroll systems through automated applications facilitates\nthe easy exchange of data between both systems.\n\nIf an employee takes an unpaid leave in the HR system, for example, this\ninformation will be automatically transferred to the payroll system when\ncalculating the employee\u2019s next salary payment. Similarly, if an employee\nreceives a pay raise or bonus, the payroll system can readjust their salary\nwithout manual imputing the data a second time.\n\n## Company health and analytics\n\nAutomating key business processes means that mass amounts of a company\u2019s raw\ndata are processed and stored on a single, intelligent data point. An often\noverlooked benefit of automating HR and payroll processing is the company\ninsights and analytics this data can produce. Additional applications, such as\nMicrosoft\u2019s Power BI, can visualize this data into graphs, charts, and\ninfographics updated daily onto customized dashboards.\n\nStakeholders in a company\u2019s home country can access always up-to-date\nanalytics about their operations in Asia \u2013 ensuring informed decision-making,\nreducing the chances of [fraud](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/2018/06/14/fraud-in-china-where-is-your-company-losing-\nmoney.html) in remote offices, and improving knowledge sharing with offices\nseparated by geography, time zones, and language.\n\n_This article was originally published in the latest issue of China Briefing\nmagazine, titled \"[HR Management Tools for\nChina](http://www.asiabriefing.com/store/book/hr-management-tools-for-\nchina-7697.html)\"._\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/whybusinesses-automate-hr-andpayroll-processing-in-china/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * \n\n* * *\n\n**_About Us_**\n\n_[China Briefing](https://www.china-briefing.com/) is produced by [Dezan Shira\n& Associates](https://www.dezshira.com/).

About\nAccountants\u2019 Shifting Role\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/payescape-automated-payroll-\naccounting/) __Share __Share __Print [__Email](mailto:?subject=What Payroll\nInnovation Says About Accountants\u2019 Shifting Role&BODY=I found this article\ninteresting and thought of sharing it with you. Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/payescape-automated-payroll-\naccounting/) __\n\nThe shifting role of small business (SMB) accountants is largely driven by the\nincrease in automated solutions available to business owners today. With\nmachines now taking care of repetitive financial tasks, accountants have had\nto readjust their position from number-cruncher to value-adder to remain\nrelevant.\n\nThe payroll function is rarely looked upon as an influence of these changes in\nthe small business accounting sphere. However, Steven Jones, business\ndevelopment manager of U.K. payroll processing company\n[Payescape](https://www.payescape.com/), said this area of the back office may\nhave a larger influence on how accountants operate than some may believe.\n\nPayroll is not necessarily a core function of the accountant's job, but,\nthanks to the often repetitive nature of the payroll process, many businesses\nwant to hand the responsibility off to the accountant. This presents a few\nopportunities for the profession, Jones told PYMNTS in a recent interview.\n\nFinTech solutions \u2014 including those that have disrupted the payroll sphere \u2014\nhave automated key financial functions for small businesses, and, in many\ncases, have taken away the traditional workload of a small business\naccountant.\n\n\"Customers are realizing, 'What do I need an accountant for?'\" Jones\nexplained. \"'They're just there for bookkeeping, bank reconciliation and\npayroll \u2014 what do I need you for when I can just do that myself?' A lot of\naccountants have lost the vision of what an accountant should be, which is an\nadvisor. A business growth manager. A finance director. A virtual CFO.\"\n\nReturning to that position enables an accountant to make more strategic\ndecisions about what work they take on for their business clients, and what\nwork they pass on to an automated solution.\n\nPayescape recently launched its [Accountants Partnership\nProgram](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/payescape-announces-new-\naccountants-partnership-program-876349045.html), an initiative that connects\nsmall business accountants to the company's payroll technology \u2014 if those\naccountants choose to use technology to automate payroll for their clients.\nJones noted that this is part of a broader shift in accounting: While FinTech\nmay be seen as a force that takes work away from accountants, the industry is\nbeginning to see this as a way to free up valuable time for accountants to\nstep up to the role of advisor.\n\nIn the payroll landscape, while the majority of the processes are repetitive\nand can be managed with technology, there are also areas that could use the\nexpertise of an accountant to add value to business clients. That's\nparticularly true when it comes to compliance and data security. The EU's\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a prime example, said Jones.\n\n\"[GDPR](https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2019/europe-data-privacy-\npayment-security-gpdr-psd2/) is a big safety net for all customers and\nemployees, so that's one thing that a lot of accountants now have to adhere\nto, and make sure that they are using technology and data in compliance with\nGDPR,\" he explained.\n\nPayroll and tax-related regulations are also a strategic focus for accountants\nhandling payroll for their customers. In the U.K., legislation related to\nemployee pensions, and the market's [PAYE\nModernization](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Tax/ie-\ntax-ges-paye-modernisation-update-april-2018.pdf) initiative (a payroll\ndigitization effort that went into effect at the beginning of the year), are\nareas in which accountants can act as compliance and risk mitigation guides to\nSMBs. However, accountants cannot take on these value-added offerings if they\nare managing payroll manually.\n\n\"Payroll is a very resource-draining, time-consuming process, and it's one of\nthose ones that has to be done. There's no way around it,\" Jones said.\n\"Payroll can be quite draining on accountants' time.\"\n\nAn accountant who wants to take on the role of \"virtual CFO\" for their client,\nyet has to manage payroll for 200 employees every month, is not likely to find\nthe time to meet the demands of an elevated, strategic role.\n\nUnderstanding where technology and automation can help \u2014 not hamper \u2014 an\naccountant's position is a key part of embracing evolution. With the payroll\nfunction continuing to see new digital disruptions and changes, the\naccountant's management of payroll will shift along with it. Jones pointed to\nthe development of voice recognition and artificial intelligence technologies,\nand how they could further automate processes in the payroll function, human\nresources operations and small business back office.\n\nFor [accountants](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/brilliant-\naccountant-automation-it/), that means a continued shift in how they manage\nthe demands of their small business clients, and provide value-added services\nthat machines cannot. One of the biggest changes the industry will see, Jones\nnoted, is the accountant's migration from retroactive, historical data\nanalysis to a forward-looking predictor of business performance.\n\n\"The role of accountant needs to be looking forward to help the business\nflourish by delivering services they need, and doing it in a time-saving\nmanner,\" he said. \"They do that by using the technology around them to save\ntime, and to spend more time with a customer to help the business grow.\"\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

In a recent interview with PYMNTS, the executives\ndiscussed how changing expectations among accountants, their corporate\nclients, and their clients\u2019 employees have driven a data integration evolution\nin the payroll arena, a space that is intrinsically connected to other areas\nof the back office.\n\n\u201cClient expectations have started changing,\u201d said Patil, \u201cand people got used\nto consuming information on their cellphones from wherever they are.\u201d\n\nThat shift has bled into the human resources management arena, where today,\nemployees are driving a self-service model of HR that enables workers to\naccess their payroll and other HR information themselves. As Vasir explained,\nthis enables employees to not only take control of various HR functions,\nincluding benefits management, taxes and retirement fund contributions, but at\nthe broader level, reconnects those employees to having control over their own\ndata.\n\nThis was the motivation behind AccountantsWorld\u2019s [latest\nAPI](https://accountantsworld.blog/2020/01/24/accountantsworld-launches-\npayroll-relief-open-api-for-hr-integration/), a data integration capability\nthat connects the company\u2019s payroll service provider-facing payroll platform\ninto any other third-party HR solution. It\u2019s a two-way data connection\nreflecting the close relationship between HR and payroll, and targeting the\nburden of duplicate data entry that so often impacts HR and payroll\ndepartments.\n\n **Unlocking Data, Unlocking Opportunities**\n\nTwo-way data integration between payroll and HR platforms are certainly a\nnatural fit, but as Patil and Vasir highlighted, that\u2019s not where the\nopportunities for payroll data integrations end.\n\nVasir pointed to data integration capabilities between paycheck withholdings\nand 401(k) management platforms, for example, another reflection of the drive\ntoward the self-service business model.\n\nFor corporates and their accountants, the opportunities in data integration\nbetween payroll and accounting and tax portals are similarly vast.\n\nPatil also highlighted the impact of open banking in this space, a model that\nhas also introduced the opportunity for payroll service providers to take\nadvantage of this seamless flow of data to facilitate bank loan applications\nfor their clients, for example.\n\n\u201cThere is this opportunity to integrate and securely and privately expose the\nrelevant data to the relevant people on demand,\u201d said Patil.\n\nThe impact of open data and data integration frameworks on the payroll sector\nis only one of several industry shifts the market is witnessing today.\n\nVasir said the drive toward faster payouts and real-time access to earned\nwages has introduced new use-cases for faster payment networks in the payroll\nspace. He highlighted The Clearing House\u2019s recent decision to raise the\nthreshold limit for [RTP transactions](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-\nmethods/2020/rtp-raises-transaction-threshold-to-100k/) from $25,000 to\n$100,000.\n\n\u201cThat will affect the payroll industry, and the expectation for speed is\ngrowing,\u201d Vasir said.\n\n **A New Data Security Paradigm**\n\nAs the payroll sector tightens its relationship with the banking arena through\nbank data integrations and faster payment rail capabilities, payroll service\nproviders will also be prioritizing another emerging trend in this space:\nsecurity. Data integrations between FinTechs, and between a FinTech and a bank\naccount, require elevated data protection due diligence, and with payroll a\nfraud-prone market, pressures to safeguard sensitive company and employee\ninformation will continue to grow.\n\nBy the same token, however, the data integrations that may elevate data\nsecurity pressures are also the technological capabilities that can strengthen\nthe payroll sectors\u2019 security initiatives.\n\nBoth Vasir and Patil highlighted opportunities in blockchain to enable secure\ndata integrations between payroll platforms and bank accounts to verify\npayroll service providers\u2019 new clients, client accounts and client employees \u2014\nas well as the opportunity in faster payments to not only address employee\npayout needs, but support employers\u2019 and payroll service providers\u2019 emerging\ndata security pressures.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of the payroll workflow is onboarding clients because\nwho you onboard is how risky your business is,\u201d Vasir said. \u201cBlockchain could\nplay a big role in identifying those people, identifying their transactions\u2026\nWith more faster payment networks, you can get real-time data telling me that\nthis bank account actually exists, how long it\u2019s been in existence \u2014 all of\nthis plays a great role in identifying risk.\u201d\n\nData integrations today are the new normal, not only for payroll, and not only\nfor the corporate financial services arena. As Vasir noted, data connectivity\nis a must for all verticals, with payroll just one space taking advantage of\nemerging opportunities for process efficiencies, elevated data protection and\nbeyond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pertinent to every industry,\u201d he said. \u201cSystems cannot limit data in\nsilos anymore, and the availability of technology and security processes\navailable today allow for real-time decision-making, real-time data exchange,\nreal-time analysis. It\u2019s happening in literally every industry.\u201d\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

**Amber Donovan-Stevens** **.** Mar 05, 2020, 9:33AM\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/company_slider/public/company/profile/R234-0039.jpg?itok=-qHJ4hgc)\n\n[](https://youtu.be/3SVXD18k2o8)\n\n##\n\nJames Haslam, Chief Financial Officer, ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll, discusses the\nevolution of the cloud HR and payroll software provider, and the role that the\nModern CFO plays in business today\n\nAs technology evolves at an exponential rate and customers demand more from\ntheir products than ever, the role of C-suite executives is also changing. Few\nunderstand this as well as James Haslam, Chief Financial Officer, ELMO Cloud\nHR & Payroll, who seeks to redefine the traditional associations of his role\nas he leads the financial strategy of the tech company that enables medium-\nsized companies (50 to 2,000 employees) within Australia and New Zealand to\ndeliver employee satisfaction through the use of its cutting-edge technology.\n\nHaslam\u2019s experience spans over an 18-year career in accounting and finance.\nBefore becoming a chartered accountant, he obtained his Bachelor of Science in\nEngineering and Business from the University of Warwick in the UK. Haslam\nmoved into KPMG\u2019s graduate program in 2001, working largely across audit and\ncorporate restructuring before moving to Australia in 2005 with KPMG's\nsecondment program where he worked primarily in corporate finance.\n\nIn 2014, he joined Deloitte as a director in the corporate finance team. Yet\nHaslam\u2019s ambitions were pulling him away from \u2018the Big Four\u2019 and in 2017 he\nfounded Financial Agility Consulting. \"I saw a gap in the market for providing\ncorporate finance advice to mid-market executive teams, particularly around\nmergers and acquisitions and IPOs,\u201d he explains. Shortly after founding the\ncompany, Deloitte reached out to Haslam, referring him to ELMO in order to\nassist with developing the company's prospectus as part of the IPO, which was\nsuccessful in 2017. Little did he know at that time how the initial engagement\nwould set him on the path to become a CFO at ELMO.  \n\n\u201cA Modern Finance Leader looks ahead by two or three years; asks themselves\n'how can we invest and lay the foundations to support further growth?\u2019\u201d -\nJames Haslam, Chief Financial Officer, ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll\n\nAs he continued with Financial Agility Consulting, Haslam continued to work on\nmergers and acquisitions (M&A) projects and IPOs until early 2019, including\nsupporting ELMO on five successful acquisitions, before he succeeded ELMO\u2019s\nthen-CFO, Trevor Lonstein. \"It's not your traditional route into the CFO\nrole,\u201d Haslam acknowledges, \u201cbut the advantage I\u2019ve gained through both my Big\nFour and consulting experience is a wide view of the strengths and weaknesses\nof many CFO\u2019s who I have worked with. I believe this experience has provided\nme with a more holistic view of businesses which I find now benefits me in my\nrole.\u201d\n\nThe skills and networking abilities gained from both KPMG and Deloitte, along\nwith its prestigious alumni, gave Haslam the tools he needed to navigate the\nindustry well, but he reflects that it was in his private consulting work\nwhere he learned how to obtain his own opportunities and engagements. \"That\nneed to be resourceful and go the extra mile with self motivation has really\nhoned my negotiation and emotional IQ skills that are so vital in my role\ntoday.\u201d He goes on: \"Learning how to really listen to the needs of\nstakeholders is integral to my work at ELMO every day.\u201d\n\nELMO is a leading provider of human capital management (HCM), payroll,\nrostering and time and attendance software solutions. \"We've currently got 14\nmodules covering the hire-to-retire spectrum, with a focus on increasing\nautomation for companies alongside providing a fantastic user experience,\" he\nsays. As CFO, Haslam's core responsibility is to set the financial strategy\nand ensure the accuracy of financial information and metrics, both internal\nand external to the company, particularly with regard to stakeholders.  This\nis in addition to the traditional role of ensuring company controls and\nprocesses are both working and effective. Yet to truly drive the company\nforward, the role of CFO needs to extend beyond day-to-day operations. \"The\nposition is no longer about simply doing the work and reporting the numbers\"\nexplains Haslam, \"but being a leader that looks beyond the numbers; being a\nprogressive figure.\u201d He describes this type of CFO as the \u2018Modern Finance\nLeader\u2019.\n\n\"A Modern Finance Leader looks ahead by two or three years; asks themselves\n'how can we invest and lay the foundations to support further growth?\u2019 and\nembraces new technology in an ever-changing landscape. To do that you need to\nbe partnered across the company and able to communicate complicated financial\ndata with any department in a way that everyone can understand.\"\n\nELMO is growing at a significant pace both organically and through\nacquisition, reporting annual recurring revenue growth of 42.8% over the last\n12 months to A$52million and it is expected the high growth will continue in\nthe near term.\n\nHaslam explains, \u201cIt is important to support the growth through the adoption\nof new technology and partnering with key providers across the business,\nparticularly as we grow our customer base, now up to 1,478 and employees up to\n368.\u201d\n\nHaslam divides the company into four segments: the financial and\nadministrative function; client services; sales and marketing; and R&D. \"All\nof these departments need great support and so we work closely with them to\nensure that their needs are being met. This also extends to C-suite members of\nthe company.\"\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-1325.jpg?itok=YbVq4NhP)\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-1339.jpg?itok=weqHUDdR)\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-1358.jpg?itok=BwKqGr33)\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-0340.jpg?itok=KXCyMcit)\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-0364.jpg?itok=VAzIaz30)\n\n![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/company-\nmedia/R234-0376.jpg?itok=BdL-vJjZ)\n\nTo ensure these partnerships are cared for, Haslam notes that there are other\ncompanies that ELMO partners with in order to support automation. \u201cFor\nexample,\u201d he says, \u201cour sales and marketing team and the executives undertake\na significant amount of travel and TripActions provides a simple and intuitive\nplatform for booking travel and capturing the data around travel.\u201d Nurturing\npartnerships like this is a part of the forward thinking, technology embracing\nattitude that the Modern Finance Leader needs in order to assist in navigating\nthe company through a fast-evolving landscape.\n\nA company that ELMO is currently engaging with is Zuora. \u201cZuora, provides\nautomated billing services and metrics reporting, we expect Zuora to have a\nmajor benefit to our operations going forwards.  Automation is a key part of\nmy outlook for finance which enables my team to spend less time undertaking\nroutine tasks and more time developing themselves, their knowledge and\ndecision making.\u201d\n\nAnother partnership Haslam is enthusiastic about is the ongoing work between\nELMO and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) on developing a new module\nleveraging data analytics and artificial intelligence in a program that will\nbenefit both institutions mutually. \"Through the partnership with UTS, which\nincludes access to their state-of-the-art data center, we can leverage our\nlarge volumes of anonymised data to develop insights  to develop algorithms\nwhich are expected to provide customers the ability to deepen their workforce\nplanning processes\" he says.\n\nTo ensure a high standard, Haslam enthuses that, for him, and for any good\nModern Finance Leader, it is imperative to have a great team that is both\nsupported and appreciated by the CFO. \"My team is the backbone of our finance\noperations and I am a big believer in empowering my team, whatever their\naspirations may be.\" Since Haslam has been in the role, he has expanded the\nteam and set up both a financial planning analysis team, and a corporate\ndevelopment team. He identifies being \u201ccollaborative\u201d as the key requirement\nfor teams. \"I want the team debating ideas and talking collaboratively. I\ndon\u2019t stress about mistakes, but I want the team feeling confident in\nexploring and finding solutions. I often say, if you can't fix your issue in\nless than 30 minutes, share it. I believe that we have a great work culture\nand I am only as good as my team. I am proud of them and their efforts.\"\n\nAs ELMO continues its upward growth trajectory, it will continue to drive\nautomation through technology. As it breaks into the finance and technology\nindustries, Haslam is confident that younger decision makers will increasingly\nadopt the ELMO solution with their increased appetite to adopt technology.\n\"Our automation makes both employers and employees lives simpler. We have\ngreat  brand equity in the ANZ region; we attract a lot of leads and we're\nevolving into a market leader in the mid-market.\u201d ELMO also garners a notable\namount of international interest, with a number of other countries taking\ninterest in the solution. Although the company is very much focused on\nmaximising growth across Australia and New Zealand it will be interesting to\nsee how this latest acquisition with operations in the UK evolves and if it\nacts as a launchpad for global expansion?\n\n## PARTNERS\n\n[TripActions](https://tripactions.com/anz)\n\n###### ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the numbers\n\n[ ![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](/sites/default/files/styles/brouchure_side225x291/public/company/brochure/BRO_ELMO_Mar2020.jpg?itok=zMaROjBy)\n](/brochure/521887) [Read Brochure](/brochure/521887)\n\nNo Thanks, take me to Web Version\n\n###### ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the numbers\n\n[ ![ELMO Cloud HR & Payroll: Beyond the\nnumbers](/sites/default/files/styles/brouchure_side225x291/public/company/brochure/BRO_ELMO_Mar2020.jpg?itok=zMaROjBy)\n](/brochure/521887) [Read Brochure](/brochure/521887)\n\nNo Thanks, take me to Web Version\n\n## PARTNERS\n\n[TripActions](https://tripactions.com/anz)\n\n## Must Read\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/styles/must_read_side306x/public/topic/image/c3.ai%204.jpg?itok=11es7Zi_)\n](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/technology/c3ai-delivering-leading-\nenterprise-ai-software)\n\n### [C3.ai: delivering leading enterprise AI\nsoftware](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/technology/c3ai-delivering-\nleading-enterprise-ai-software?q=ntr)\n\n[![Mastercard paying with\ncard](/sites/default/files/styles/must_read_side306x/public/topic/image/paying%20with%20card.jpg?itok=bYQm7l3C)\n](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/fintech/how-mastercard-building-innovative-\nstartup-ecosystem)\n\n### [How is Mastercard building an innovative startup ecosystem?\n](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/fintech/how-mastercard-building-innovative-\nstartup-ecosystem?q=ntr)\n\n[![global financial market\nstock](/sites/default/files/styles/must_read_side306x/public/topic/image/GettyImages-1133595964_0.jpg?itok=bA4Lyt6T)\n](https://www.fintechmagazine.com/fintech/fintech-profile-swift-financial-\nmessaging-innovator)\n\n### [FinTech profile: SWIFT -

[Join BI\nPrime](/subscription/prime?r=readmode) and start reading now.\n\n  * **As the coronavirus crisis forces people to work remotely, tools that help them stay connected and productive are booming in popularity.**\n  *  **We asked a select group of VCs to name enterprise startups that could take off this year as a result of the changing work environment.**\n  * Each investor named two \"future of work\" startups: one in their portfolio, and one company they admire but have no financial interest in.\n  * [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet).\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has changed not only where people work from, but how\nthey work and what tools they use.\n\nAlready, apps like [Zoom](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-filing-impact-\ncoronavirus-eric-yuan-2020-3) and\n[Slack](https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-7000-new-paid-customers-since-\nfebruary-coronavirus-2020-3) have seen huge increases in usage in the past few\nweeks, as users grab onto ways to stay connected in their work and personal\nlives while social distancing.\n\nThe urgent need for better work tools could catapult some enterprise startups\ninto the pantheon of unicorn startups, as their users multiply and venture\ncapital investors jump to fund them.\n\nWe wanted to find the startups that are already transforming the future of\nwork, defining the new ways in which people are doing their everyday jobs. We\nreached out to a select group of venture capitalists with enterprise bets in\ntheir portfolios and asked them to name the startups that are positioned to\nhave very good years.\n\nWhen we spoke to each investor, we set some ground rules for participation:\n\n  1. The VC had to tell us about one startup in their portfolio. After all, they had enough conviction in the company to write it a check.\n  2. We also asked them to name one \"future of work\" startup where they have no financial interest. Those are the companies they're closely watching, maybe with a bit of envy.\n\nTheir nominations cover all aspects of work, from processes like recruiting\nand onboarding to products such as video conferencing, chatbots, and email.\n\n **Here are the 30 startups they named, listed in alphabetical order:**\n\n## Airtable: A smart spreadsheet app with a cult following in tech\n\n![Howie Liu](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5bc60204df918d124e4bbba8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nHowie Liu is the cofounder and CEO of Airtable.

The patent-pending anti-microbial\nfinish drying hangers with an open design avoid threading newly harvested\nplants through traditional hangers, thus avoiding damage to plants, and costly\nwaste as bud stems are broken in the process. Furthermore, the precisely\npositioned indentations on the weight-balanced horizontal bar allow even\nspacing around plants for consistent drying. Finally, those same indentations\nimprove ease of pruning once the plants are dry, to maximize the output and\nminimize the labor.\n\nJames Cunningham, founder and CEO of Vertical Air Solutions, said, \u201cWe could\nnot be happier with bringing this product to market. We have tested the design\nrepeatedly at Fog City Farms, and have experienced first-hand the improvements\nboth in manpower efficiency, as well as quality and quantity of output.\"\n\nIan Swift, Fog City Farms operations manager, added, \u201cThese seemingly simple\nproducts are a game-changer. Not only does this hanger improve the consistency\nof our flowers, we combine it with a rolling rack, so our workers only touch\nthe plants once at harvest, and simply roll the rack through the weighing,\ndrying, and pruning process, saving us valuable labor expense.\"\n\nThe hangers will be available directly from Vertical Air Solutions at\n[www.vertairsolutions.com](https://vertairsolutions.com/) on Jan. 1, 2020, and\nare priced at $299.50 for packages of 50 hangers, shipping not included.\nFurther discounts are available for larger quantities.\n\n## [How to Dry and Cure Cannabis Plants](/keyword/drying-curing/)\n\n# Agrify Enters into Agreement to Acquire TriGrow\n\nTriGrow is currently the exclusive distributor of Agrify\u2019s fully automated,\nmicro-climate, precision-controlled vertical farming unit solution to indoor\ncannabis cultivators.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nDecember 16, 2019\n\n  \n\n[ Posted by Melissa Schiller ](/author/13463)\n\n[Vendor News](/news/category/vendor-news)\n\nBURLINGTON, Mass., Dec. 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via CannabisNewsWire --\nPRESS RELEASE -- [Agrify](https://www.agrify.com/), a developer of indoor grow\nsolutions, has announced it has entered into a memorandum of understanding to\nacquire all outstanding shares of TriGrow Systems Inc. and, indirectly, 75% of\nits subsidiary TriGrow Brands, LLC.\n\nTriGrow, a company backed by cannabis industry specialist venture funds\nincluding Poseidon Asset Management and Arcadian Funds, is currently the\nexclusive distributor of Agrify\u2019s fully automated, micro-climate, precision-\ncontrolled vertical farming unit (VFU) solution to indoor cannabis\ncultivators.\n\nAgrify\u2019s modular VFU System allows its customers to significantly scale\ncultivation operations by enabling the highest consistency and quality of crop\nproduction while lowering operating and capital expenditures.

The ongoing debacle, which allegedly\ninvolves malfeasance on the part of the payroll company's CEO, resulted in\ncountless people having money drained from their bank accounts and has left\nnearly $35 million worth of payroll and tax payments in legal limbo.\n\nUnlike many stories here about [cloud service providers being extorted by\nhackers for ransomware\npayouts](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=cloud+ransomware&x=0&y=0), this snafu\nappears to have been something of an inside job. Nevertheless, it is a story\nworth telling, in part because much of the media coverage of this incident so\nfar has been somewhat disjointed, but also because it should serve as a\nwarning to other payroll providers about how quickly and massively things can\ngo wrong when a trusted partner unexpectedly turns rogue.\n\nClifton Park, NY-based [MyPayrollHR](https://www.mypayrollhr.com) -- a\nsubsidiary of [ValueWise Corp.](http://www.valuewisecorporation.com) --\ndisclosed last week in a rather unceremonious message to some 4,000 clients\nthat it would be shutting its virtual doors and that companies which relied\nupon it to process payroll payments should kindly look elsewhere for such\nservices going forward.\n\n[![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mypayroll-\nmessage.png)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/mypayroll-message.png)\n\nThis communique came after employees at companies that depend on MyPayrollHR\nto receive direct deposits of their bi-weekly payroll payments discovered\ntheir bank accounts were instead debited for the amounts they would normally\nexpect to accrue in a given pay period.\n\nTo make matters worse, many of those employees _found their accounts had been\ndinged for two payroll periods -- a month's worth of wages -- _leaving their\nbank accounts dangerously in the red.\n\nThe remainder of this post is a deep-dive into what we know so far about what\ntranspired, and how such an occurrence might be prevented in the future for\nother payroll processing firms.\n\n#### A $26 MILLION TEXT FILE\n\nTo understand what's at stake here requires a basic primer on how most of us\nget paid, which is a surprisingly convoluted process. In a typical scenario,\nour employer works with at least one third party company to make sure that on\nevery other Friday what we're owed gets deposited into our bank account.\n\nThe company that handled that process for MyPayrollHR is a California firm\ncalled **Cachet Financial Services**. Every other week for more than 12 years,\nMyPayrollHR has submitted a file to Cachet that told it which employee\naccounts at which banks should be credited and by how much.\n\nAccording to interviews with Cachet, the way the process worked ran something\nlike this: MyPayrollHR would send a digital file documenting deposits made by\neach of these client companies which laid out the amounts owed to each\nclients' employees. In turn, those funds from MyPayrollHR client firms then\nwould be deposited into a settlement or holding account maintained by Cachet.\n\nFrom there, Cachet would take those sums and disburse them into the bank\naccounts of people whose employers used MyPayrollHR to manage their bi-weekly\npayroll payments.\n\nBut according to Cachet, something odd happened with the instructions file\nMyPayrollHR submitted on the afternoon of Wednesday, Sept. 4 that had never\nbefore transpired: MyPayrollHR requested that all of its clients' payroll\ndollars be sent not to Cachet's holding account but instead to an account at\n**Pioneer Savings Bank** that was operated and controlled by MyPayrollHR.\n\nThe total amount of this mass payroll deposit was approximately $26 million.\n**Wendy Slavkin** , general counsel for Cachet, told KrebsOnSecurity that her\nclient then inquired with Pioneer Savings about the wayward deposit and was\ntold MyPayrollHR's bank account had been frozen.\n\nNevertheless, the payroll file submitted by MyPayrollHR instructed financial\ninstitutions for its various clients to pull $26 million from Cachet's holding\naccount -- even though the usual deposits from MyPayrollHR's client banks had\nnot been made.\n\n#### REVERSING THE REVERSAL\n\nIn response, Cachet submitted a request to reverse that transaction. But\naccording to Slavkin, that initial reversal request was improperly formatted,\nand so Cachet soon after submitted a correctly coded reversal request.\n\nFinancial institutions are supposed to ignore or reject payment instructions\nthat don't comport with precise formatting required by the [National Automated\nClearinghouse Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACHA) (NACHA), the\nnot-for-profit organization that provides the backbone for the electronic\nmovement of money in the United States. But Slavkin said a number of financial\ninstitutions ended up processing both reversal requests, meaning a fair number\nof employees at companies that use MyPayrollHR suddenly saw a month's worth of\npayroll payments withdrawn from their bank accounts.\n\n**Dan L 'Abbe**, CEO of the San Francisco-based consultancy [Granite Solutions\nGroupe](https://www.granitesolutionsgroupe.com/), said the mix-up has been\nmassively disruptive for his 250 employees.\n\n\"This caused a lot of chaos for employers, but employees were the ones really\naffected,\" L'Abbe said. \"This is all very unusual because we don't even have\nthe ability to take money out of our employee accounts.\"\n\nSlavkin said Cachet managed to reach the CEO of MyPayrollHR -- **Michael T.\nMann** -- via phone on the evening of Sept. 4, and that Mann said he would\nwould call back in a few minutes. According to Slavkin, Mann never returned\nthe call. Not long after that, MyPayrollHR told clients that it was going out\nof business and that they should find someone else to handle their payroll.\n\nIn short order, many people hit by one or both payroll reversals took to\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mypayrollhr?src=hash) and Facebook to\nvent their anger and bewilderment at Cachet and at MyPayrollHR. But Slavkin\nsaid Cachet ultimately decided to cancel the previous payment reversals,\nleaving Cachet on the hook for $26 million.\n\n\"What we have since done is reached out to 100+ receiving banks to have them\nreject both reversals,\" Slavkin said. \"So most -- if not all -- employees\naffected by this will in the next day or two have all their money back.\"\n\n#### THE VANISHING MANN\n\nCachet has since been in touch with the FBI and with federal prosecutors in\nNew York, and Slavkin said both are now investigating MyPayrollHR and its CEO.\nOn Monday, New York Governor **Andrew Cuomo** [called\non](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1170099720804622340/photo/1) the\nstate's Department of Financial Services to investigate the company's \"sudden\nand disturbing shutdown.\"\n\n![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fbi-mypayroll.png)\n\nA tweet sent Sept. 11 by the FBI's Albany field office.\n\nThe $26 million hit against Cachet wasn't the only fraud apparently\nperpetrated by MyPayrollHR and/or its parent firm: According to Slavkin, the\nnow defunct New York company also stiffed **National Payment Corporation**\n(NatPay) -- the Florida-based firm which handles tax withholdings for\nMyPayrollHR clients -- to the tune of more than $9 million.\n\nIn a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, NatPay said it was alerted late\nlast week that the bank accounts of MyPayrollHR and one of its affiliated\ncompanies were frozen, and that the notification came after payment files were\nprocessed.\n\n\"NatPay was provided information that MyPayrollHR and Cloud Payroll may have\nbeen the victims of fraud committed by their holding company ValueWise, whose\nCEO and owner is Michael Mann,\" NatPay said. \"NatPay immediately put in place\nsteps to manage the orderly process of recovering funds [and] has more than\nsufficient insurance to cover actions of attempted or real fraud.\"\n\nRequests for comment from different executives at both MyPayrollHR and its\nparent firm ValueWise Corp. went unanswered, and the latter's Web site is now\noffline. Several erstwhile MyPayrollHR employees reached via LinkedIn said\nnone of them had seen or heard from Mr. Mann in days.\n\nMeanwhile, Granite Solutions Groupe CEO L'Abbe said some of his employees have\nseen their bank accounts credited back the money that was taken, while others\nare still waiting for those reversals to come through.\n\n\"It varies widely,\" L'Abbe said. \"Every bank processes differently, and\neveryone's relationship with the bank is different. Others have absolutely no\nmoney right now and are having a helluva time with their bank believing this\nis all the result of fraud. Things are starting to settle down now, but a lot\nof employees are still in limbo with their bank.\"\n\nFor its part, Cachet Financial says it will be looking at solutions to better\ndetect when and if instructions from clients for funding its settlement\naccounts suddenly change.\n\n\"Our system is excellent at protecting against outside hackers,\" Slavkin said.\n\"But when it comes to something like this it takes everyone by complete\nsurprise.\"\n\n[ ![](/b-akamai/33.jpg) ](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/our-\nthinking/state-of-the-internet-report/global-state-of-the-internet-security-\nddos-attack-\nreports.jsp?utm_source=krebsonsecurity&utm_medium=display&utm_id=F-MC-49586&utm_campaign=security_digital_publication_2020&utm_content=SOTI)\n\nTags: [Cachet Financial Services](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/cachet-\nfinancial-services/), [Dan L'Abbe](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dan-\nlabbe/), [Granite Solutions Groupe](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/granite-\nsolutions-groupe/), [Michael T.

Thanks to direct deposit, your\nemployees no longer need to head straight to the bank on paydays.\n\nWhile direct deposit is safer, cheaper, greener and an often more efficient\nway of paying employees, it's not without the occasional problem. Because of\nhow important it is to pay your employees accurately and on time, small\nbusiness owners must understand how direct deposit works and whether it's\nright for their businesses.\n\n## What is direct deposit?\n\nDirect deposit is the electronic form of a paycheck. It's an electronic\ntransfer of funds from an employer's business bank account to an employee's\naccount at a bank or credit union. It's also known as an automated clearing\nhouse transaction. This process requires the employee's bank account number,\nrouting number, type of account, bank name and address, and the names of the\naccount holders listed on the account.\n\nDirect deposit isn't used solely for paying wages. \"It is also used for tax\nrefunds, retirement benefits, expense reimbursements, investment\ndistributions, and insurance claim payments,\" said Heather McElrath, senior\ndirector of communications at the National Automated Clearing House\nAssociation (Nacha).\n\n **Editor's note: Need a payroll service for your business? Fill out the below\nquestionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you with free information.**  \n\n## What is Nacha?\n\nWhen it comes to payroll services it's best to get familiar with Nacha, which\nis also known as the Electronic Payments Association. This nonprofit manages\nthe Automated Clearing House Network, which processes and moves trillions of\ndollars every year. The ACH moved [23 billion\npayments](https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-moves-23-billion-payments-\nand-51-trillion-2018), valued at $51 trillion, in 2018. These transactions\nincluded direct deposit, Social Security, government benefits, electronic bill\npayments and person-to-person and business-to-business payments.\n\nThe ACH network creates the grid for all American financial institutions to\nsafely transfer money from one bank account to another. Nacha is not a\ngovernment agency, but it works directly with the Federal Reserve, state\nbanking authorities and the Treasury Department. Nacha has its own rules and\ncode of ethics that ensure business is conducted fairly and with as little\nrisk as possible.\n\n## Setting up direct deposit\n\nAs a small business owner, you can set up direct deposit through your payroll\nprovider or bank. When [setting up your payroll\nservice](https://www.business.com/categories/online-payroll-services/), make\nsure your employees fill out their [direct deposit\nforms](https://www.business.com/articles/payroll-forms-guide/). Your payroll\nprovider or bank sends the direct deposits to the ACH.\n\nOnce the ACH reviews your direct deposit orders for payroll, they transfer the\nmoney from your business bank account to your employees' banks. This process\nusually takes at least two business days, according to Nacha. Keep in mind\nthat exactly when the money hits your employees' accounts may vary, depending\non your bank, your employees' banks, the payroll software or service you use\nand holiday schedules.\n\n## Direct deposit services for small business\n\nOnce upon a time, 28 million checks were written daily, according to a study\nin James McKenney's _Waves of Change: Business Evolution Through Information\nTechnology_. Today, [nearly 93% of American workers are paid using direct\ndeposit](https://www.nationalpayrollweek.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019GettingPaidInAmericaSurveyResults.pdf), which includes\nboth small and large businesses, according to a 2018 American Payroll\nAssociation survey. Like many technological advancements, direct deposit has\npushed out its paper predecessor.\n\n\"Whether you are a 10-person operation or smaller, or a business of more than\n100 employees, you can gain from direct deposit's advantages,\" said McElrath.\nUsing direct deposit gives you more control over your finances and provides\nyou with up-to-date electronic records of your payments. This electronic\nrecord helps clear up any confusion about your payroll deposit and provides a\npoint of reference.\n\n## Pros of direct deposit\n\nDirect deposit has a lot to offer in terms of speed and efficiency, proving to\nbe a win-win for both you and your employees. Here are some of the benefits of\nusing direct deposit.\n\n### It saves your business money.\n\nDirect deposit, like most online innovations, has a lot to offer. It helps\nbusinesses save a lot of money by eliminating manual check preparation. Since\nthere is no need for postage and mailing supplies, it saves business owners\nabout [$3 per paper check](https://fsucu.org/2017/05/09/the-advantages-of-\ndirect-deposit/).\n\nDirect deposit can also be used to pay Social Security benefits. In 2013, the\nSocial Security Administration mandated beneficiaries collect their payments\nelectronically. Child support payments and tax refunds can also be sent using\nthis method. To receive your tax refund this way, inform your tax preparer. If\nyou want to save some of your tax refund, you can disburse funds into several\ndifferent accounts \u2013 you only need to provide your bank account information.\n\n### It saves your business time.\n\nSaving money is always a bonus, but saving time is also a welcome win. With\ndirect deposit, you no longer spend time printing and mailing paper paychecks,\nand you no longer need to wait for all of your employees to cash their checks.\nIt also saves employees time since they no longer need to wait in line at the\nbank to cash or deposit their paychecks.\n\n### It's more secure than paper.\n\nDirect deposit has a big security advantage over paper checks, which can be\nlost, stolen or counterfeited. Direct deposit is perceived as more secure by\n[83% of employees](https://www.nacha.org/news/new-nacha-survey-shows-adoption-\nand-awareness-direct-deposit-ach-continues-build), according to the Nacha\nsurvey. In a recent Association of Finance's [Payments Fraud and Control\nSurvey,](https://www.afponline.org/ideas-\ninspiration/topics/articles/Details/afp-survey-payments-fraud-hits-record-\nhigh-of-78) researchers found that checks were the most vulnerable to fraud.\n\n### It supports employees' financial health.\n\nDirect deposit allows you to help your employees automatically direct part of\ntheir paycheck into their savings accounts. \"With split deposit, employees can\ndirect a fixed amount or percentage of their pay into a savings or investment\naccount to help build savings,\" said McElrath. \"As the single biggest\ninfluence on employees' use of direct deposit, businesses can play a key role\nin supporting employee financial health.\"\n\nMost financial institutions offer free checking when employees use direct\ndeposit, which saves on banking fees, said Kristin Walle, senior vice\npresident of Global Payments and Compliance at Automatic Data Processing, Inc.\n\n### It's good for the environment.\n\nOur environment is precious, and when we say direct deposit is greener, we\nmean it. A 10-person small business that pays employees twice a month uses\n10.7 pounds of greenhouse gases each year \u2013 that's the equivalent of driving\nalmost 40 miles in your car.\n\nIf the same small business switched to direct deposit instead of printing\npaper checks, it would save 3.7 pounds of paper, 35.7 gallons of waste water\nfrom being drained into natural bodies of water, 1.4 gallons of gas, and 4.3\npounds of solid waste, according to the\n[Wagepoint](https://blog.wagepoint.com/all-content/the-four-ways-that-direct-\ndeposit-benefits-your-business).\n\nCan you imagine the impact on the environment if big corporations like Amazon\nor Microsoft used only paper checks?\n\n## Cons of direct deposit\n\nThere are some drawbacks of using direct deposit that you'll want to consider,\nboth for employers and employees.\n\n### It's time-sensitive.\n\nDirect deposit is a very time-sensitive process, and depending on an\nemployer's workload, deadlines could be overlooked. If you don't collect all\nof your employees' time and attendance sheets and [process payroll\n](https://www.business.com/articles/how-to-do-payroll/)by a certain day and\ntime, the money won't be transferred into your employees' accounts on time.\nLate checks lead to disgruntled employees, and if you want to speed up the\nprocess, it will cost you extra.\n\n### There are potential security risks.\n\nBecause you need your employees' bank routing and account information to set\nup direct deposit, you need to have strong security measures in place to\nprotect this sensitive information.\n\n### Changing banks means starting over.\n\nChanging banks can also prove to be an inconvenience, because it means\nchanging direct deposit information, so all of your employees will need to\nsubmit new authorization forms.\n\n### There's no \"stop payment\" option.\n\nAlthough it's convenient to use direct deposit to make payments, you can't put\na stop on the payment like you can with a paper check \u2013 which might be an\nissue if you make a mistake when calculating employee hours.\n\n### You could incur overdraft fees.\n\nIf you don't have enough money in your account when funds for payroll are\nwithdrawn, it puts you in the negative \u2013 you'll incur overdraft fees, which\ncan be both inconvenient and expensive.\n\n## How much does it cost to set up direct deposit for my employees?\n\nDirect deposit may seem to be all about saving time and money, but you can be\nhit with service fees that range from $50 to $149. Banks may also charge\nemployers each time money is transferred from their account to an employee's.\nIndividual deposit fees can range from $1.50 to $1.90 per transfer.\n\nTo find out exactly how much it costs to set up and maintain direct deposit,\ncontact your financial institution or payroll provider. The financial\ninstitution or payment processor pays a fee to use the ACH network, but Nacha\ndoes not track fees that a business may incur, McElrath said.\n\n\"Generally, [the] cost to use direct deposit are low,\" McElrath said. \"Most\ncompanies would save money using direct deposit compared to other payment\nmethods, and any startup costs would be recouped in savings and increased\nproductivity.\"\n\n## What time do payroll direct deposits post?\n\nDirect deposit fund posting is governed by Nacha's rules, which all financial\ninstitutions abide by, said Walle. \"As a result, the funds are available by 9\na.m. local time at the receiving depository institution on the settlement\nday,\" she said. \"Many financial institutions 'memo-post' incoming transactions\nso employees may see a 'pending' transaction prior to funds being available.\"\n\nMost American employees who use direct deposit are paid at the opening of\nbusiness, on the Friday of payday. If your business doesn't have set paydays,\nyou can use direct deposit to pay employees promptly using same-day ACH. The\npayment would post by 5 p.m. on the day the payments are made, McElrath said.\n\n## Can you pay contractors using direct deposit?\n\nBusinesses can pay independent contractors using direct deposit the same way\nthey pay traditional employees \u2013 contractors need to fill out the direct\ndeposit form. \"While there may be differences in the specifics of how a\ncontractor is administered in a payroll system, the money-movement mechanics\nare the same,\" Walle said.\n\nThe difference is that contracted workers are not required to fill out a W-2\nduring their payroll process like traditional employees. Instead, [they fill\nout W-9 forms, and you provide a 1099 form](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-\ntips/self-employment-taxes/what-is-irs-form-w-9/L2f51WOD7) if you pay them\n$600 or more per year.\n\nWant more advice for your business?\n\nGet free tips from experts in our small business community.\n\nEnter your email address below.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA.

The number of establishments\n[increased](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS000205722?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)\n17% between 2009 and 2018, making up over 75% of all growth in the [leisure\nand\nhospitality](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS0002051026?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)\nsector during this time period. These \u201c[third\nplaces](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-\ncommunity-builders/)\u201d are the life blood of many American towns, vital to our\ncultural fabric and employment base.\n\nThis brief captures COVID-19\u2019s rapid impact on the food and beverage industry.\nIn the last week, we spoke with 13 servers (including bartenders and wait\nstaff), managers, and restaurant owners in the Washington, D.C. metro area to\nunderstand how the impact is playing out in our own backyard.1 We asked them\nto share their experiences and perceptions of what has happened over the last\nthree weeks and what forms of support they would find most helpful.\n\nThis piece builds on a [previous blog\npost](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/24/covid-19-will-\nupend-retail-but-there-are-steps-we-can-take-to-save-it/) about broader shifts\nin the retail landscape being accelerated by COVID-19. A forthcoming piece\nwill examine the unemployment insurance (UI) safety net typically available\nfor food and beverage workers and provide an early analysis of what the\n[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)\nAct](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text) does\nand does not do for these workers.\n\n## **The early impact on food and beverage businesses**\n\nThe initial effect of the pandemic was a precipitous drop in customers. This\nhas a tremendous impact on both a server\u2019s income and the owner\u2019s revenue.\nSeveral business owners and managers that we interviewed noted that delivery\nand takeout orders were not getting sufficient customer response.\n\n\u201cAt first, we decided to do [take-out and delivery], and we had zero foot\ntraffic,\u201d said a manager of a restaurant and entertainment center in Virginia.\n\u201cWe are located in a town center\u2026We have apartment buildings here. We offered\napartments delivery and said that we would bring food to them to try to stay\nopen. We did $300 in sales. Labor costs were about $600. Due to this, we\nunfortunately decided that we had to close our doors.\u201d\n\nThe next step for many business owners was to consider how long they could\nkeep their workers on payroll, as well as how to communicate with them about\nshutting down and their options afterward.\n\n\u201cI made a commitment to our employees to keep the team together, because we\nhave a management team and marketing guy, and sales,\u201d one owner told us. \u201cWe\nhave a really tight team of people, but everybody has to take a 20% pay cut.\nI\u2019m the owner and I\u2019m taking [no pay]. I\u2019m looking to try to leverage or sell\noff some equity in the business to help raise money to cover those folks so\nthat they don\u2019t end up on unemployment.\u201d\n\nNot all owners are as protective of their staff. One bartender told us that\nshe did not receive official communication from management that she should not\nreport to work until several days after the establishment closed. \u201cI had a\nshift that was cancelled on [March 14], and they never said anything to me,\u201d\nthe bartender told us. \u201cI don\u2019t feel valued as an employee. I doubt that any\nof us do.\u201d\n\nReflecting on what is happening sector-wide, a Baltimore brewery owner shared\nhis concerns that small restaurants will have even more difficulty sustaining\npayrolls, which he believes will have an almost immediate impact on workers.\n\n\u201cSmall business makes up a huge proportion of employment in this country, and\nwhen you hit pause for the hospitality industry and a lot of small\nmanufacturers, the payroll is just the first thing to suffer,\u201d said the\nbrewery owner. \u201cEven a really successful restaurant may have a 10% margin, and\nif you have a big payroll every week and that\u2019s your largest expense, that\ndoesn\u2019t go very far.\u201d\n\nEven after turning off the lights and laying off staff, restaurants and bars\nwill still owe rent. This was top of mind for one owner of a small, family-run\nmall food stand. \u201cWe are really afraid of how we are going to pay the rent,\u201d\nshe told us. \u201cThe rent is super expensive, and we are not making any money.\u201d\n\nA manager at a Virginia restaurant added, \u201cOne of the things that Italy has\ndone is rent forgiveness\u2026If they were to do rent forgiveness for the month,\nthat would help small businesses everywhere. My restaurant pays $25,000 in\nrent per month. Even in our slow month, last month, we ended up doing $150,000\nin sales. But [what happens] when that drops down to less than $10,000 and we\nhave to pay $25,000 in rent and our loans?\u201d\n\nIn addition to rent and debt, some operating costs and other sunk costs such\nas insurance premiums aren\u2019t as easy to turn off as the utilities. Small\nbusinesses need additional liquidity\u2014quickly\u2014in order to meet these\nobligations or they will fail.\n\nThe federal government has moved fairly quickly to provide some relief to\nsmall businesses and unemployed workers through the [Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-\nbill/6201) and the [CARES Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/748/text). The latter provides $350 billion in loans to\nbusinesses with under 500 employees affected by the coronavirus, including up\nto eight weeks of reimbursement for those loans for payroll, utilities, and\nother eligible expenses. But it is unclear if this package [will be\nenough](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/small-businesses-get-help-in-\ncoronavirus-relief-bill-but-is-it-enough.html).\n\n## **What\u2019s happening to workers**\n\nA typical food and beverage establishment employs \u201cfront-of-house\u201d employees\n(such as servers, bartenders, hosts, and bussers), back-of house employees\n(cooks, dishwashers, and food prep workers), and managerial or supervisory\nstaff. Work arrangements in this sector range tremendously, from entry-level,\nmostly part-time staff with no health insurance or other benefits (more common\nin smaller or lower-cost establishments) to highly experienced, full-time\nstaff with benefits (more common in high-end and larger companies).\n\nAcross our interviews, workers, managers, and owners alike expressed feeling\noverwhelmed and fearful about what would happen to the industry in the coming\nmonths. Servers and managers we interviewed were in different financial\npositions depending on whether they had savings, debt, existing health\nconditions, or a partner who was employed or had health insurance. Several\nnoted that most of workers in the industry tend to live paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nThe top concerns of workers were how they would pay their rent or mortgage,\nwhether they would lose their health insurance (if they had it), what they\nwould do if they got sick (especially if they did not have health insurance),\nhow they would pay for food and utilities, and whether they would get further\nin debt than they already were.\n\n\u201cI have cancer, so I can\u2019t really go out at all,\u201d one manager told us. \u201cMy\nnext scan is scheduled for May 11, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get it.\u201d\n\nSome of the workers and managers we interviewed had health insurance through a\npartner, but most said that they were uninsured or would lose their health\ninsurance by the end of April. The CARES Act does not include provisions for\nthose who are or will become uninsured due to job loss or benefit cuts. Those\nworking in the restaurant industry who contract COVID-19 or experience another\nadverse health event in the coming months may face increased medical debt, on\ntop of everything else.\n\nWorkers and managers we interviewed were especially concerned about their\nestablishments\u2019 dishwashers. Dishwasher positions are typically very low-paid\nhourly workers, often occupied by recent immigrants\u2014both the undocumented and\nthose who have legal authorization to work.\n\n\u201cI really feel for people who don\u2019t have documentation who are already here\nand working their asses off, because they are getting really screwed right\nnow,\u201d one server told us. \u201cI want some sort of compassionate response. We can\nsay, \u2018Okay, you need to eat, and you can\u2019t pack up and go back to El Salvador\nright now, so what can we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough the CARES Act expands unemployment insurance (UI) eligibility to low-\nwage workers who would not normally meet their state\u2019s minimum income\nrequirements, it does not expand it to undocumented workers.\n\nAlmost everyone that we interviewed felt that a $1,200 direct payment from the\nfederal government was a good start, but won\u2019t be enough if the pandemic\ncontinues for several months. \u201cMy rent is $1,700,\u201d one server said. \u201cNo,\n$1,200 is not enough. It might be enough for somebody in the middle of the\ncountry, but not for people in big cities.\u201d\n\nSeveral people we interviewed suggested suspending rent payments until the\npandemic ends, and compensating landlords or banks for it.\n\n\u201cD.C. is not allowing any evictions, but I\u2019m banned from working, legally\nbanned from collecting an income,\u201d one server told us, referencing the ban on\nin-restaurant dining. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that my landlord gets paid.\nIt\u2019s a little unfair when the government says, \u2018You can\u2019t have a job anymore.\u2019\nBut they can still take your money.\u201d\n\nThe CARES Act retroactively adds $600 to unemployment insurance benefit levels\nfrom January 27 until July 31, 2020. But it is unclear to what extent state\nlabor agencies will be able to implement these changes smoothly and accurately\non such short notice given the unprecedented demand on their UI systems. For\nnow, many state labor agencies are recommending that applicants wait until\ntheir agency announces that their system has incorporated CARES Act changes\nbefore they reapply. UI experts estimate that it will take a minimum of two to\nthree weeks to do so.\n\n## **How to help the industry right now**\n\nIn our interviews with workers, managers, and owners in the food and beverage\nindustry, we asked for their ideas on what forms of support would be most\nhelpful. We organized their responses into three basic categories that should\nbe the focus of policymakers moving forward.\n\n  * **Facilitate fast and adequate implementation of the relief packages**. Even in the absence of a crisis, the country\u2019s UI system tends to be [very complicated](https://research.upjohn.org/up_press/249/) and difficult for unemployed workers to navigate. The typical eligibility rules [exclude many workers](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/reports/2016/06/16/138492/strengthening-unemployment-protections-in-america/), and each state has different system, which are now largely automated and often [antiquated](http://www.itsc.org/pages/ui-it-mod.aspx), so it can be hard to obtain staff assistance. The changes to UI under the CARES Act will be extremely challenging for federal agencies and state governments to implement in the midst of this crisis, so they will need more support. At the legislative level, designing a nationally consistent solution that minimizes confusion and streamlines implementation will help.\n  * **Act quickly to save small businesses.** Owners expressed concern about whether the new small business loan program could be implemented before a rash of establishments permanently close. States and local jurisdictions should consider bridge programming such as Indiana\u2019s [Rapid Response fund](https://www.response.indychamber.com/loans) to get immediate support to businesses and encourage them to treat layoffs as a last resort through alternatives such as work sharing, also known as [short-time compensation](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/how-we-use-powerful-tool-flatten-unemployment-curve/).\n  * **Address the lack of health coverage during the pandemic (and beyond)**. The federal relief packages passed so far do not include health insurance options (other than those already available, such as Medicaid). Millions of Americans in the food and beverage industry never had health insurance or will lose employer-provided coverage before the end of April.\n  * **Address the lack of paid sick leave**. We have yet to address the lack of paid sick leave for many individuals who cannot work due to quarantines, family care responsibilities, or contracting COVID-19. This also holds true for undocumented workers.\n  * **Minimize the impact of coronavirus on personal debt levels**. Given the [disproportionate debt burden](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/size-and-scope-of-consumer-debt/) borne by low-income Americans (such as auto loans and medical debt), we can anticipate that individuals experiencing income loss from COVID-19 will have trouble paying what they owe. This crisis may compound their debt and expose them to other negative consequences from nonpayment if they cannot access available relief programs.\n  * **Consider rent and mortgage freezes.**[Housing-related debt](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/07/12/charts-of-the-week-americans-wealth-and-debt/) (either lease debt or mortgage debt) is a typical American\u2019s largest expense. [Temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/what-to-do-if-you-cant-make-your-rent-or-mortgage-payments.html) may keep people in their homes for now, but they do not reduce overall rent or mortgage obligations for [many reasons](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/25/halting-evictions-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-isnt-as-good-as-it-sounds/). Most businesses also owe rent. Many people we spoke to in the industry believed that suspending both commercial and residential rent would be the most helpful immediate solution.\n  * **Adjust future stimulus checks for costs of living.** The CARES Act authorizes a $1,200 check to every adult who earns less than $75,000 per year (scaling down to zero for higher-earning workers\u2014calculate your check amount [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/)). The workers, managers, and owners that we spoke to said that $1,200 checks are a good start. However, because payments are not adjusted for areas with a high cost of living and because we are unsure how long the crisis will continue, workers fear that $1,200 will not be enough. One owner described them as \u201ca Band-Aid on a gunshot wound.\u201d\n\n## **Saving the industry is a collective action** ****\n\nEconomic hardship and insecurity have already begun to manifest in the lives\nof food and beverage industry workers and business owners. State and local\nadministrators have been working overtime to do the best they can, but the\nreality is that a crisis of this scale will require an all-hands-on-deck\nsolution, in which everybody who has the means to help should do so.\n\nPhilanthropy, corporations, and wealthy donors can play a key role in\nproviding funding to boost immediate response efforts and awareness of\navailable support to those who are most heavily impacted. For instance, some\ninternet service providers are offering [free or low-cost internet\nservice](https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19) during the pandemic. Some\nrestaurants and wealthy individuals have set up crowdfunding and social media\ncampaigns to donate cash to unemployed restaurant workers.\n\nMany community-based organizations, food banks, job centers, training\nproviders, and other organizations are ramping up their virtual and telephone\naccess to food delivery, health care, employment, and training needs. However,\nthey too will probably need time and additional resources to get systems fully\nonline and new operating modes in place to meet crisis levels of demand.\n\nSome resources are emerging to help jobless workers navigate relief systems,\nincluding UI. For example, overloaded state systems have led to a surge in\noutside portals for support and information, such as this [one on\nReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)\nor this [one-on-one\nassistance](https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/covid-19-resources/one-on-\nones) option for gig workers.\n\nEmployers that need to resort to layoffs can consult resources about [how to\ncommunicate](https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-\nlead-to-layoffs) bad news to their workforce in a way that is respectful and\ninformative. Many of the workers that we interviewed reported a lack of\ncommunication or explanation about why management felt that they needed to\nresort to layoffs.\n\nAbove all, the U.S. needs to take stock of its safety net during this crisis\nand make sure it aligns with the value that our small businesses and service\nindustry workers bring to the economy. \u201cI don\u2019t see a huge push by anyone to\nbe a voice for people in the service industry,\u201d one owner told us. \u201cThese are\nthe hardest hit\u2014the people that everybody takes for granted.\u201d\n\nThe future of the food and beverage industry is uncertain, but it is very\nclear that the people who work in it are suffering immensely right now, and\nrequire unprecedented reassurance and relief.\n\n\u201cIt has killed me to do all this,\u201d one owner said after he described laying\noff almost his entire staff. \u201cIt made me cry. It\u2019s making me cry again. You\nthink you have everything in hand, and, then\u2026It\u2019s too hard to put it to\nreason. It\u2019s just so weird. Who knows? So, I worry about everyone.\u201d __\n\n_The authors wish to extend special thanks to the owners, managers, servers,\nand bartenders in the food and beverage industry who took the time to share\ntheir experiences and perspectives with us._\n\n## Related Content\n\n[ ![FILE PHOTO: Cyclists ride through a nearly empty Times Square in Manhattan\nduring the coronavirus disease \\(COVID-19\\) outbreak in the Brooklyn borough\nof New York City, New York, U.S., March 31, 2020.

Inexpensive.\n\n **Cons:** No weekend support. Can't pay with prepaid debit cards. Fewer\nreports than competitors.

Quick setup of employees. Custom reporting. COBRA\nmanagement. Helpful tooltips.\n\n **Cons:** Native mobile app does not support benefits\n\n **Bottom Line:** Rippling is an easy-to-use HR platform with solid onboarding\nand BA functionality that should be a solid choice for small to midsize\nbusinesses.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/software/120284/rippling)\n\n  * ### [SurePayroll](https://uk.pcmag.com/surepayroll-2012)\n\n**** $ 31.00\n\n **Pros:** Interactive, customizable dashboard. Supports multiple payroll\ntypes. Excellent recordkeeping and payroll-processing tools. Calculates and\nsubmits payroll taxes.\n\n **Cons:** Crowded interface. No free trial.\n\n **Bottom Line:** SurePayroll is one of the oldest online payroll solutions,\nand its maturity shows in its thoroughness, in-depth recordkeeping, competent\npayroll processing, and exceptional customer care.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/accounting-tax-software/1656/surepayroll)\n\n  * ### [Zenefits](https://uk.pcmag.com/zenefits)\n\n**** $ 5.00\n\n **Pros:** Well-designed, intuitive user interface. Integrates with well-known\npayroll processors. Built-in benefits. And free (mostly).\n\n **Cons:** Lacks add-ons that some of the other HR software offers. No mobile\napp.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Human resources (HR) software and management system Zenefits\nis best suited for start-ups and small to midsize businesses (SMBs) with\nsalaried workers to whom they need to administer benefits and perks.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/79612/zenefits)\n\n  * ### [Intuit Enhanced Payroll](https://uk.pcmag.com/intuit-online-payroll-plus)\n\n**** $ 39.00\n\n **Pros:** Comprehensive, thorough setup wizard. Supports e-filing of payroll\ntaxes. Good selection of payroll-processing tools and customizable reports.\n\n **Cons:** Doesn't automatically submit payroll taxes. Duplication and\ninconsistency in the user interface and navigation tools. Only integrates with\nQuickBooks and QuickBooks Online.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Intuit Enhanced Payroll is a highly capable payroll service\nfor small businesses, but it hasn't kept up with the best of the competition\nin terms of payroll taxes or user interface.\n\n  * ### [ONPAY](https://uk.pcmag.com/onpay)\n\n**** $ 40.00\n\n **Pros:** Exceptionally simple, clean interface. Price. Handles departments.\nThirteen custom pay types. Multitier user permissions. Security passcode for\ncall-ins.\n\n **Cons:** Access to online Knowledge Base has too many layers. No weekend\nsupport hours. No mobile apps.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Considering that it's a relative newcomer to online payroll\nwith major competition, ONPAY has made a strong start. It handles employee and\ncompany setup as well as payroll taxes admirably, but access to its online\nhelp requires extra clicks. It also lacks mobile apps.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/accounting-tax-software/2581/onpay)\n\n  * ### [Workful](https://uk.pcmag.com/workful)\n\n**** $ 50.00\n\n **Pros:** Excellent user experience.

Can't define earnings\ntypes. Online help skimpy. No mobile admin app.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Workful is a new payroll management site for small\nbusinesses that lacks reporting tools and doesn't submit payroll taxes, but is\nstill exceptional in some ways.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/software/120682/workful)\n\n  * ### [Patriot Software Full Service Payroll](https://uk.pcmag.com/patriot-software-full-service-payroll)\n\n**** $ 25.00\n\n **Pros:** Free live setup assistance. Excellent online guide to state\nemployer setup. Good framework for records and tasks. Integrated basic\naccounting. Free email, phone, and chat support.\n\n **Cons:** Lacks online setup wizard. Weak dashboard. Can't pay contractors\n(1099 software costs extra). No payroll total after processing. No mobile\napps.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Patriot Software Full Service Payroll does an exceptional\njob of supporting its customers, but it lacks some important features, and its\ninterface lags behind those of the best services.\n\n[Read Review](https://uk.pcmag.com/accounting-tax-software/76075/patriot-\nsoftware-full-service-payroll)\n\n  * ### [Square Payroll](https://uk.pcmag.com/square-payroll)\n\n**** $ 29.00\n\n **Pros:** Contractor-only pricing option. Unlimited payrolls. Automated\npayroll option. Good integration with other Square apps. New mobile apps.\n\n **Cons:** Limited earnings types. Some navigation awkward. Lacks preformatted\nreports. No integration with accounting applications. Rudimentary setup tool.\nOnly supports PTO or sick pay.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Square Payroll checks most of the boxes for paying your\nstaff and sports a simple user experience. It integrates well with other\nSquare apps, but lacks the depth and customizability of its competitors.\n\n  * ### [Payroll by Wave](https://uk.pcmag.com/payroll-by-wave)\n\n**** $ 20.00\n\n **Pros:** Good setup tools and employee records. Clear navigation system and\nuser interface.\n\n **Cons:** Payroll taxes paid for only six states. Can't define employer\ncontributions for benefits; can't deduct a percentage of pay. Payroll runs\nconfusing and require too many steps. No mobile apps. Only one report. Only\nintegrates with Wave.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Payroll by Wave, available as a standalone payroll website\nor an integrated element of the Wave accounting suite, has been slow to mature\nand has drawbacks that make it hard to recommend.\n\n## Keep Track of Your Payroll\n\nEveryone loves payday\u2014except, that is, the payroll administrator. Paying\nemployees (and contractors, and freelancers) is the most complex element of\nany accounting system. It's also the scariest. Not only do you have to produce\nchecks and direct deposits that are 100 percent accurate, but you also have to\nmake certain that the underlying calculations\u2014taxes, benefits, and other\nwithholding\u2014are also correct, to the penny. Furthermore, you have to submit\ntaxes and filings to the IRS and other tax agencies.\n\nCloud-based payroll applications can help ensure that all of these obligations\nare met with precision and timeliness. We reviewed 10 of the most popular,\nsome of which have been around for years, including Gusto, OnPay, Patriot\nSoftware Full Service Payroll, Square Payroll, SurePayroll, and Payroll by\nWave. Sage Payroll Essentials Plus was sold to a different company, so it\ndoesn't appear this year. Intuit Enhanced Payroll has been replaced by\nQuickBooks Full Service Payroll. Rippling and Workful are new to our roundup,\nbut they've been around for a couple of years. Zenefits Payroll has been\nretooled and is ready to compete in this group.\n\nEven with such formidable competition, Gusto wins the Editors' Choice again\nthis year. It's the one we recommend small businesses to consider first.\nNewcomer Rippling also got high marks. It offers midrange-level features and\nsophistication for about the same cost as Gusto.\n\n[![Gusto](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 16\n9'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](javascript:OpenImageWindow\\('https://www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1740,iid=650476,00.asp',\n'1004', '691'\\))\n\n## Precision Is Paramount\n\nIf you're still doing your company's payroll manually, you're well aware of\nhow complex, exacting, and deadline-driven this process is. Your employees\ncount on you to dispatch their paychecks and authorize direct deposits on\nscheduled paydays. They expect you to know how much to withhold for all the\ntaxes you owe and the benefits you offer.\n\nTax agencies can assess stiff fines if payroll filings and taxes aren't\nreceived by the scheduled dates. Benefits providers can cut off services like\nhealth insurance if you fall behind on payments.\n\nThat's an enormous amount of detail to track, especially if you're trying to\ndo it all on paper. Mistakes aren't tolerated well by anyone involved.\n\n## Simplifying the Complex\n\nCloud-based payroll solutions can help you organize and automate this onerous\ntask. They offer step-by-step wizards to guide you through the time-intensive\nprocess of creating records for employees and supplying the information needed\nfor withholding. They let you establish your own payroll schedules. They do\nall the required calculations, and most of them actually submit your payroll\ntaxes and filings to the appropriate agencies.\n\nThese sites walk you through each payroll run and tell you how much each will\ncost you. They provide report templates and offer online portals and mobile\napps for employees that display current and historical paystub data and more,\nin some cases. Not surprisingly, they're equipped with generous support\noptions. And they're not overly expensive; they mostly run between roughly $25\nto $40 per month for the base fee and charge a few extra dollars per month for\neach employee.\n\nThe benefits are obvious. You save time and minimize frustration. You don't\nhave to keep up with payroll tax tables nor deal with the myriad compliance\nissues associated with employee compensation. You can modify your records\nquickly, and you have instant access to the smallest details. You're much less\nlikely to make errors using one of these services.\n\n## The Setup\n\nThough each payroll site we looked at provides its own unique user experience,\nthey all share similar structures. They begin with the setup process, which is\nby far the most time-consuming and detail-oriented element of paying your\nstaff. Though the exact order varies, they all walk you through pages of\nquestions in an orderly, step-by-step fashion. They ask for information about\nyour company, its address and Employee Identification Number (EIN). You select\nyour payroll schedule (usually weekly or semimonthly) and name your payroll\nadministrator and signatory.\n\nIf your business offers benefits such as health insurance and retirement\nplans, you name them and enter information about both the cost to employees\nand any company contributions. You must also create detailed records for each\nemployee, such as contact information, birthdate, Social Security number,\nsalary or hourly pay rate, and number of allowances from the W-4 form. Since\nmost of these sites submit your payroll taxes and support direct deposit of\ncompensation, you'll be asked for bank account information to make a\nconnection.\n\nYou'll also need to enter any payroll history that exists if you've already\nbeen compensating employees. This can be an arduous chore, one that may\nrequire assistance from the sites' onboarding specialists.\n\nIf you offer additional payroll types like Paid Time Off (PTO) and sick pay,\nyou can define your policies for accruing these benefits; the services keep\ntrack of them for you. Bonuses and commissions can also be paid during a\nregular pay run, or you can issue them by creating an \"off-cycle\" payroll.\nNeed to include garnishments like child support on paychecks? These sites\nsupport such withholding. In fact, most offer custom pay types, so you can\ncreate your own\u2014sometimes even when you're in the middle of a pay run.\n\n## Running Payroll\n\nOnce you've completed setup, you generally can't return to the dedicated setup\ntools, so it's important to get it right the first time. That said, every\nservice we've looked at has a comprehensive settings section where you can\nmodify and add to the payroll information you've already entered.\n\nSetup done, you're ready to run your first payroll. This is the easy part.\nThough there are some differences, these sites function similarly during the\nactual pay run. When you launch a payroll, they display a list of employees\nalong with their pay rates. You first check to make sure the pay period and\npay date are correct. Then, you simply enter the number of hours worked (where\napplicable), in the appropriate pay type boxes (regular, overtime, vacation,\nand so on). Most sites let you add dollars for other earnings types and\nreimbursements on this same page.\n\nOnce you complete everything necessary on that screen, you advance to the next\nto see a preview of your payroll. The various services handle this slightly\ndifferently, but you'll be able to see each employee's gross and net pay,\nwithholding for taxes, benefits, and net pay, along with any company\ncontributions. You should also see on this page\u2014or the next\u2014the total amount\nof money the site will take from your bank account for direct deposits and\ntaxes, along with the exact date it will be debited.\n\nAfter you approve your payroll, you'll have access to additional tables or\nreports that display absolutely every detail of the pay run.\n\nIf you have few employees or a very simple payroll, it shouldn't take more\nthan a few minutes to do the actual processing. Depending on which site you're\nusing, you may be able to let payrolls process automatically (assuming, of\ncourse, that there are no changes from the previous run). Some even offer\nsame-day payroll.\n\n## What's Not Included\n\nThough many of these sites offer HR support in addition to payroll, we focused\nin on payroll capabilities for these reviews. Zenefits, for example, which\nrecently won an Editors' Choice for Benefits Administration, offers payroll\nprocessing, but that capability is considered an add-on. In fact, Zenefits\nsupports integration with other payroll websites in addition to providing its\nown. Rippling employs a similar structure and emphasis.\n\n[![Zenefits - Employee Dashboard](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16\n9'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](javascript:OpenImageWindow\\('https://www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1740,iid=612792,00.asp',\n'1240', '999'\\))\n\nUnlike the other solutions reviewed here, you can't isolate Zenefits' payroll\ncapabilities, because setup and administration of elements like benefits and\ntime off are handled on other parts of the site. Everything is intertwined,\nwhich can be a good thing: You only enter employee data once, for example, and\nit's used throughout the website. But you have to visit separate areas of\nZenefits to set up benefits and deductions.\n\nIn larger companies, payroll and benefits administration are usually handled\nby separate departments. In your small business, though, both of those\nresponsibilities may land on your desk or that of another employee or two.\nFortunately, there are several online HR services beyond Rippling and Zenefits\nthat integrate with payroll applications to manage tasks such as the\nfollowing:\n\n  * [Applicant tracking](/cloud-services/76321/the-best-applicant-tracking-systems),\n  * [Benefits administration](/cloud-services/85252/the-best-benefits-administration-software),\n  * [Scheduling and shift planning](/cloud-services/82885/the-best-employee-scheduling-shift-planning-software),\n  * [Performance management](/cloud-services/76675/the-best-performance-management-software), and\n  * [Online learning](/cloud-services/82258/guide/the-best-online-learning-platforms-for-business-in-2018).\n\nTo learn more about providers of these services and to see which were\ndesignated as Editors' Choices, click the links above to read roundups of\nsolutions dedicated to those services, or go straight to our [HR\nsoftware](/cloud-services/75068/the-best-hr-software) roundup to read about\nservices that round up all of the above.\n\n## Many Similarities\n\nThe payroll services reviewed here all come from reputable companies with\nyears or even decades of experience behind their tools. I wouldn't hesitate to\ntrust any of them with this complex task. They all share similar parts, though\ntheir user experiences are very different, and each has a slightly different\nset of extras. They're all designed for general small business use, though\nSurePayroll goes above and beyond by offering versions designed specifically\nfor use by, for example, restaurants, nonprofit organizations, and churches.\n\nBut Gusto takes the top spot again this year. It hits the sweet spot for\npayroll, offering enough functionality to please a wide variety of small\nbusinesses, while not overwhelming with additional features and fees. Its user\ninterface and navigation system are among the best, and its three-tiered\npricing structure gives potential users new options. In a tough group of\ncompetitors, it's the best choice.\n\nAnd once you get your payroll running smoothly, take a look at our [online\naccounting services](https://uk.pcmag.com/accounting-tax-software/32761/the-\nbest-small-business-accounting-software) and [tax software](/accounting-tax-\nsoftware/4403/the-best-tax-software) roundups.\n\n## Featured Online Payroll Software Reviews:\n\n  * ![Gusto](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16 9'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n### [Gusto Review](/accounting-tax-software/72382/gusto)\n\n![Editors' Choice](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16 9'%3E%3C/svg%3E)  \nMSRP: $39.00  \n****at\n\n**Pros:** Excellent user interface and navigation system.

Extra charge for W-2 and 1099\nforms. Incomplete enrollment tool.\n\n **Bottom Line:** SurePayroll is a thorough, flexible payroll website with\ngood support and excellent reporting.

The two companies\nhad been working together, but now Personio is bringing [Rollbox's\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/rollbox) tech and team in-house.\n\nThe full terms of the deal remain undisclosed. However, I understand the\nacquisition consists of a combination of cash and equity. This sees a number\nof Rollbox's investors being issued shares in [Personio,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/personio-gmbh) while others have exited\nentirely.\n\nFounded in 2016, Rollbox was backed by SaaS investor Point Nine and Berlin-\nbased VC La Famiglia, along with individual investors Paul Forster (founder of\nIndeed) and Brian Pietras (VP Strategy at Workday).\n\nMeanwhile, I'm told Rollbox's founders, Xavi Leal and Ismael Sanchez, are\njoining Personio and will be key members of the management team going forward.\nThe Rollbox brand will be decommissioned and the tech merged into the Personio\nplatform. Rollbox customers are being invited to move over to Personio.\n\n\"This deal will allow Personio\u2026 to extend is HR Operating System by [adding] a\nfully integrated payroll engine that can help customers fully automate\npayroll,\" Personio co-founder and CEO Hanno Renner tells TechCrunch. Features\ninclude real-time validation, automated government, insurance and tax\ncommunication and on-the-fly payroll calculations.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Personio-\nPayroll-1.png?w=680)\n\nCiting Rollbox's international footprint -- the company operates in Spain,\nU.K. and Germany -- Renner also says the acquisition will help facilitate\nPersonio's internationalization across Europe, which began earlier this year.\n\nOn that note, Personio says it will retain both offices and all employees.\nAggregated headcount will now sit at more than 200 employees: currently 190\nemployees in Personio's Munich HQ and 25 employees in Madrid.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Transforming Payroll With RPA \u2013 Everything You Need to Know - HR Technologist", "link":

study by EY pegs RPA in payroll as a low cost, high-outcome area for\nimplementation. We consider the top four benefits of adopting RPA in payroll\nand share an interesting success story in this space._**\n\nAutomation is among the most popular buzzwords sweeping through the HR\nindustry. Robotic Process Automation (RPA), specifically, is a highly relevant\nand easy-to-implement automation methodology that could transform several\nroutine HR tasks. RPA works via automated scripts, software agents, and bots\nconducting activities at an exceptional rate of accuracy and speeds. RPA\naddresses common human errors and mistakes that creep in because of work\nfatigue. In a segment where error-free operations and data accuracy is so\nimportant, i.e., payroll, RPA has all the more potential for instituting\nchange. Unlike most enterprise-grade solutions, RPA is relatively more cost-\neffective and simpler to implement. So, is RPA-led payroll the new normal for\nthe HR industry? Let\u2019s unravel this further.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n_**Also read: _[How to Automate Payroll for SMBs - A Complete\nGuide](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-to-\nautomate-payroll-for-smbs-a-complete-guide/)_**_\n\n## Payroll Wasn\u2019t Always a Leading Candidate for Automation\n\nAs per 2016\u2019s Shared Service & Outsourcing Network\u2019s (SSON) RPA\n_[Survey](http://gpminstitute.com/publications-resources/Global-Payroll-\nMagazine/july-2017-issue/using-robotic-process-automation-to-transform-\npayroll-administration)_ , payroll administration wasn\u2019t very conducive to RPA\nadoption. One of the roadblocks cited was that manual payroll activities may\nnot be adequately documented, down to \u2018if/then\u2019 levels of granularity. Unlike\nAI, RPA isn\u2019t capable of intelligent decision-making. Therefore, the absence\nof exhaustive documentation across payroll in a variety of scenarios, employee\ntypes, and organizational levels first needed to be addressed.\n\nHowever, in the last three years, we have witnessed HR digital transformation\nevolve in leaps and bounds. With so many of HR functions being prepped for\ndigitization, documentation is now almost universal. Additionally, there are a\nnumber of documentation tools available, helping HR practitioners overcome\nthis foundational hurdle for RPA in payroll.\n\n_**Also read: _[Let A Robot Be Your New Clerk With\nRPA!](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/digital-transformation/let-a-\nrobot-be-your-new-clerk-with-rpa/)_**_\n\nWith organizations gradually becoming ready for RPA adoption in payroll, there\nare some obvious benefits motivating this change.\n\n## Four Benefits of RPA in Payroll\n\n  1. **Data Collection Streamlining** \\- Collating all the data needed for payroll processing has been among the most time-consuming aspects of the payroll lifecycle. After capturing the information, it has to be converted into a standardized format, reconciling any changes across departments. It\u2019s no wonder, therefore, that payroll professionals are left running from pillar to post at month end, trying to keep cumbersome spreadsheets up-to-date until disbursal. RPA in payroll helps integrate disparate departmental systems into a single solution. Wherever new information is added, it is automatically reformatted and updated into the system.  \n\n  2. **Data Access Acceleration** \\- For larger organizations or even multi-site SMBs, it\u2019s often necessary to exchange files between HR and finance, await information updates, export in different formats, and manually perform an upload or backup. Needless to say, this is a major drain on your time and resources. Payroll RPA creates a single source of truth across the organization. Site-specific HR applications are tightly integrated with the global payroll framework, ensuring there\u2019s a singular database, accessible to all authorized parties, without the need for many layers of approval.  \n\n  3. **Data Validation Accuracy** \\- The data validation process can take hours or even days, cross-checking each field against expense records, benefits, taxation norms, and other criticalities. By automating this process, it\u2019s possible to remain compliant with organizational as well as regulatory payroll standards, without checking for each and every field. Users can automatically set business rules in-line with organizational guidelines defining the required tolerances or exceptions. The RPA bot will then validate the entire database, triggered by pre-set events. What\u2019s more, there is no keystroke error, eliminating the time spent on correcting easily preventable errors.  \n\n_**Also read: _[Kryon Announces New Time-Based Triggers for RPA\nenhancement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/workforce-scheduling/kryon-\nannounces-new-timebased-triggers-for-rpa-enhancement/)_**_\n\n  1. **Task Handling Improvements** \\- Using RPA in payroll, you can schedule and complete repetitive tasks at a click \u2013 this can include data transfer, payslip generation, benefits disbursal, and others. RPA allows \u2018set once, use everywhere\u2019 workflows, reducing duplication of efforts.\n\nGiven these obvious benefits and significant ROI in terms of input costs and\nefforts, employers are gradually adopting RPA in payroll as well as in other\nHR systems. Here\u2019s a quick glance at what lies ahead.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nA _[report](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-robotic-process-\nautomation-for-hr-and-payroll/%24FILE/EY-robotic-process-automation-for-hr-\nand-payroll.pdf)_ by EY reaffirms that one of the biggest advantages of RPA in\npayroll is a robust ability to leverage existing systems and even legacy XLS\nfiles, to bring in new efficiencies. 93 percent of an HR employee\u2019s work hours\nare spent on repetitive tasks, found the report. Nearly 65 percent of these\ncan easily be automated, saving companies FTE costs, and employees, their\nvaluable time. While outsourcing has traditionally been an option for bigger\ncompanies, RPA in payroll could actually save 65 percent more, compared to\noffshore service centers.\n\nEY\u2019s findings suggest that in the future, humans and robots will work in\ngreater synergy, where robots take ownership of iterative data-related tasks.\nInterpretation and decision-making, on the other hand, still remain under the\nambit of human workers. A leading international bank has\n_[adopted](http://taoautomation.com/perspectives/bank-case-study/)[RPA\n](http://taoautomation.com/perspectives/bank-case-study/)_in payroll/payments\nto reduce manual errors by 84 percent, in addition to a 70 percent uptick in\nproductivity. This is in line with EY\u2019s prediction that RPA can unlock up to\n35% in potential savings.\n\n_**Also read: _[A Guide for Introducing Robots in the\nWorkforce](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/a-guide-for-introducing-robots-in-the-workforce/)_**_\n\n\u201cPayroll is perfect for Robotic Process Automation, as it does well with\nprocesses that are recurring and heavily rule-based. Automating payroll allows\nsmall business owners and their accountant or bookkeeping partners, for\nexample, to spend less time on back-office operations and more time building\ntheir businesses or providing more careful financial analysis. Gusto\u2019s\n_[AutoPilot](https://gusto.com/product/payroll)_ feature, for example, allows\ncustomers to process payroll automatically without logging into their\naccount,\u201d said Rick Chen from Gusto.\n\nClearly, the benefits of RPA (both field-proven and future-focused) cannot be\noverstated. It\u2019s simply a matter of questioning current attitudes, exploring\nhow digitalization could not only save resources but actually free up human\nattention to generate real value.\n\n[

Yet,\nhow people are paid hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot with most employers still\npaying employees on a bi-weekly, monthly, or other set cadences. What has\nchanged dramatically, though, are the expectations of many employees. The\nMillennial and Gen Z populations, for example, rarely carry cash, sporadically\naccess a traditional bank account, and are often storing funds on mobile\nwallets. How employees expect to be paid today is changing. In fact, a [recent\nPaychex study](https://www.paychex.com/newsroom/news-releases/future-of-work-\nreport?utm_source=guest-contribution&utm_medium=news-release&utm_campaign=pay-\nflexibility&utm_term=business-solutions&utm_content=hr-technologist) shows\nthat 50 percent of employees prefer a pay schedule that differs from the bi-\nweekly norm. The same study found 26 percent of employees would like to be\npaid weekly, 10 percent monthly, and 10 percent semimonthly (twice per month).\nCurrently, only four percent of all employees prefer same-day pay, but this\nnumber increases to 25 percent among independent contractors.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe growth of the gig economy is one of the major factors impacting how and\nwhen employees get paid, as gig economy-supported platforms are renowned for\noffering workers the ability to be paid immediately for work performed.\nEvolving technology is also playing a leading role in this shift, as is the\nfact that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck (according to a\n[CareerBuilder](http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-\nPaycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-\nCareerBuilder-Survey) survey) \u2013 that\u2019s a major portion of the population who\nmay benefit from an alternate payroll frequency than the bi-weekly or monthly\nnorm. Ultimately, employees who are happy and fulfilled in their personal life\n\u2013 which includes financial well-being \u2013 are more likely to be engaged in their\nwork. HR and business leaders should be exploring all technology options to\noptimize employee wellness from every angle \u2013 including how they\u2019re paid.\n\nIncreasingly common pay flexibility options include:\n\n**Pay-on-demand** : Sometimes referred to as on-demand pay or earned-wage-\naccess, pay-on-demand gives workers access to wages that are earned but not\nyet paid out. This process is typically executed using a third-party who keeps\ntrack of the time worked\\pay earned and then distributes the amount requested\nto the worker. This pay option can help employers attract top talent and is a\npowerful retention tool.\n\n**Real-time payments** : Taking pay flexibility a step further, employers will\nsoon be able to process their payroll disbursing real-time payments through\nThe Clearing House (TCH) Real-Time Payments (RTP) network. Simply put, this is\nanother example of technology built for consumer apps like Venmo and Zelle\u00ae\ndriving employee expectations. With the help of cutting-edge HR technology\nsolutions and a financial industry focused on faster payments, real-time\npayments enable employers to deposit a worker\u2019s pay directly into employees\u2019\nbank accounts in a matter of seconds via the TCH RTP network.\n\n**Learn More:[Improving Employee Experience with Pay\nTransparency](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/improving-employee-experience-with-pay-transparency/)**\n\nNo matter when, where, or how it\u2019s delivered, payroll is the foundation of the\nemployer-employee relationship. As new payroll technologies become available,\nemployers must evaluate the needs of their employees and invest in the tools\nthat will meet those evolving expectations. In the case of businesses\ncurrently processing payroll manually, the logical first step in that\nevolution is to select a reputable payroll partner to help streamline and\nautomate the process.\n\nThese days, especially in the current tight labor market, payroll is\nincreasingly important to the success of any business when it comes to\nattracting and retaining employees, as well as avoiding financial and legal\npenalties. But, the reality is, it\u2019s not a task that will help a business\ngenerate new leads or grow its customer base. Therein lies the benefit of\npartnering with a payroll services provider. In finding the right payroll\nsolution for them, organizations can reap the timesaving and recruitment and\nretention benefits that outsourcing provides by offering the types of\ninnovative, flexible technology solutions \u2013 including flexible payments \u2013 that\nmore and more of their employees have come to expect.\n\n**Learn More:[Unlocking Payroll: Why Outsourcing is No Longer

Credit:\nBusiness Wire.\")\n\nUS-based restaurant management technology firm Toast has acquired Human\nResource (HR) and payroll software provider for restaurants StratEx.\n\nStratEx offers HR software and consulting services enabling restaurants to\nautomate applicant tracking, scheduling, payroll, benefits, and labour law\ncompliance.\n\nToast CEO Chris Comparato said: \u201cAt Toast, we know that for a restaurant to be\nsuccessful it often starts with recruiting and retaining a great team, yet\nmany restaurants wrestle with employee turnover that can exceed 70%.\n\n\u201cBy adding StratEx to the Toast Platform, we can better support restaurants of\nall sizes in simplifying HR, payroll, and talent management on a platform that\nworks seamlessly with Toast and our technology partner ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAs the transaction is complete, Toast has integrated StratEx\u2019s platform into\nits Payroll & Team Management solution.  \n\nToast launched its payroll and HR solution in May this year to enable\nrestaurant operators to manage payroll and employees by automating payroll,\nstreamlining on-boarding, and reducing compliance risk.\n\nStratEx CEO Adam Ochstein said: \u201cWe\u2019re passionate about the restaurant\nindustry and helping our community of restaurateurs succeed in today\u2019s dynamic\n- and often challenging - labour market.\n\n**During the COVID-19 crisis, which of the following do you feel is the best\noption to help maintain operator revenues as far as possible?**\n\n  * Sale of gift vouchers to customers\n  * Offering delivery services (in countries where this is still possible)\n  * Offering retail meals instead\n  * Offering catering services to businesses\n\nView Results\n\n![Loading ...](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-\npolls/images/loading.gif) Loading ...\n\n\u201cIn Toast we discovered a partner that is equally as passionate about the\nrestaurant community. Joining forces allows us to accelerate investments in\nour platform and build new employee-facing products that will allow\nrestaurants running on Toast to attract, hire, and retain great teams.\u201d\n\n[Toast](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/toast-funding-expand-\nbusiness/) raised $250m in a Series E funding round led by TCV and Tiger\nGlobal Management to expand its platform in April this year.\n\n### RECOMMENDED COMPANIES\n\n#### Learn more\n\nHover over the logos to learn more about the companies who made this project\npossible.\n\nShow me\n\nClose\n\n[\n\n  * ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/01/tudor-logo.jpg)\n\n#### Tudor Tea and Coffee\n\nTudor Tea and Coffee offers a wide range of high-quality...\n\n[ ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/31/2019/01/tudor-logo.jpg)\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-equipment/tudor-tea-\ncoffee/) [ Tudor Tea and Coffee\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-equipment/tudor-tea-\ncoffee/)\n\n##### About\n\nTudor Tea and Coffee offers a wide range of high-quality coffee machines and\nethnically sourced hot beverage products for the UK foodservice industry.\n\n[WhitePapers](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#white-papers) [Press\nReleases](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#press-releases) [Regional\nOffices](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#regional-offices)\n[Video](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#videos) [\nFollow](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/login/)\n\n### Make an Enquiry\n\nFollow this company\n\nFollow the company to be always up to date with this company\n\n[ ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/31/2019/01/tudor-logo.jpg)\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-equipment/tudor-tea-\ncoffee/) [ Tudor Tea and Coffee\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-equipment/tudor-tea-\ncoffee/)\n\nTudor Tea and Coffee offers a wide range of high-quality coffee machines and\nethnically sourced hot beverage products for the UK foodservice industry.\n\n[WhitePapers](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#white-papers) [Regional\nOffices](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/#regional-offices) [Message\ncompany](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-\nequipment/tudor-tea-coffee/)\n\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/catering-equipment/tudor-tea-\ncoffee/) [\n\n  * ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/10/logo.jpg)\n\n#### QuickOrder\n\nQuickOrder provides management software for restaurants that collects and\nprocesses...\n\n[ ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/31/2018/10/logo.jpg)\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/) [\nQuickOrder\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/)\n\n##### About\n\nQuickOrder provides management software for restaurants that collects and\nprocesses data for the optimisation of operations.\n\n[WhitePapers](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#white-\npapers) [Press\nReleases](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#press-\nreleases) [Regional\nOffices](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#regional-\noffices)\n[Video](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#videos)\n[ Follow](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/login/)\n\n### Make an Enquiry\n\nFollow this company\n\nFollow the company to be always up to date with this company\n\n[ ![](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/31/2018/10/logo.jpg)\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/) [\nQuickOrder\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/)\n\nQuickOrder provides management software for restaurants that collects and\nprocesses data for the optimisation of operations.\n\n[WhitePapers](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#white-\npapers) [Regional\nOffices](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/#regional-\noffices) [Message\ncompany](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/)\n\n](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/contractors/finance/quickorder/)\n\n* * ##
