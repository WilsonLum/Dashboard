media streaming and storage platform, Kaltura simultaneously stores such\ncontent as videos, audio recordings, and presentations while providing the\nability to stream on-the-go or to a desktop device through their MediaSpace\nwebsite, mobile application, or through embedded links, a media player in\nCanvas, or other platforms.Image: Cyndi Carey\n\n# Kaltura now available for Penn Staters to store and stream media\n\nAugust 16, 2018\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 [Kaltura](https://cmm.psu.edu/kaltura/) is now\navailable for the University community to store, create and stream media to\nindividual devices and through links embedded in Canvas. Kaltura will work\nwith [Zoom](http://cmm.psu.edu/zoom/), Penn State\u2019s conferencing system, to\nprovide a complete conferencing and streaming solution to replace Adobe\nConnect.\n\nAs a media streaming and storage platform, the Kaltura\n[MediaSpace](https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/) or \u201cCampus Tube\u201d creates\nmedia storage options that can be used to create, upload, share, search,\nbrowse and listen to recorded audio and watch live or recorded videos,\npresentations and webcasts.\n\nIn 2016, the University determined that Adobe Connect was not meeting all\nlive-streaming and media management needs. The following year, Zoom was\nintroduced to Penn State to enhance audio and video conferencing abilities.\nKaltura will serve as the final piece to the University\u2019s conferencing and\nmedia management solution by providing unlimited media storage and integrating\nwith Canvas to bring students and faculty members fast, reliable audio and\nvideo streaming.\n\nAdobe Connect, the University\u2019s current conferencing and media storage\nservice, will be phased out over the 2018-19 academic year. Media including\ntraining videos and lectures will be copied from Adobe Connect to Kaltura by\nPenn State Enterprise Information Technology during fall semester 2018. Adobe\nConnect service will not be disrupted while media is being copied over to\nKaltura and users do not need to take any action to move or copy content.\nStarting Dec. 17, Adobe Connect will be placed in a \u201cread-only\u201d state in which\nusers can continue to view media but will be unable to edit or upload\nadditional media. Adobe Connect will be completely retired as of May 17, 2019.\nLearn more about the [Adobe connect retirement timeline on the Conferencing\nand Media Management website](http://sites.psu.edu/cmm/adobe-connect-\nretirement/).\n\nTown Hall sessions will take place in September and October for members of the\nUniversity community who want to learn more about the transition and ask\nquestions. Details on these sessions and information on how to register and\nsubmit questions in advance will be shared within the next two weeks.\n\n[Training resources](https://cmm.psu.edu/kaltura/#kal-training) including a\nquick-start guide for students and Learning Paths for faculty, instructional\ncontent creators and non-instructional staff, available on the Kaltura\nwebsite, so all Penn Staters can start learning how to create, edit, upload,\nwatch and share content in Kaltura. Live training options and additional\nlearning resources will be added and communicated throughout the fall\nsemester. Further information on how to install and use Zoom for audio or\nvideo conferencing is available on Penn State\u2019s [Zoom\nwebpage](http://cmm.psu.edu/zoom/#support).\n\nFor more information about Kaltura and the transition away from Adobe Connect,\nvisit the [Conferencing and Media Management website](http://cmm.psu.edu/).\n\nFor additional questions or support, contact the IT Service Desk by email at\n[ITservicedesk@psu.edu](mailto:ITservicedesk@psu.edu), by phone at\n814-865-4357 or in person at 130 W.

Kaltura's integration with Canvas gives faculty options in classrooms and\nonline\n\nTravis Johnson\n\nApril 17, 2019\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Dan Coughlin\u2019s hands skip across his keyboard, then he\nreaches for the mouse. With just a few clicks, a week\u2019s worth of video lessons\nfor the applications development class he teaches at University Park are\nuploaded, embedded and waiting for his students in Canvas.\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough thanks to [Kaltura](https://cmm.psu.edu/kaltura/), Penn\nState\u2019s new media management and storage platform that seamlessly integrates\nwith Canvas and allows users to create and stream content from any device at\nany time.\n\nThis level of accessibility has come in handy when face-to-face time in the\nclassroom isn\u2019t always guaranteed. Instructors like Coughlin used Kaltura to\naugment lessons when inclement weather this semester caused classes to be\ncanceled.\n\n\u201cIt allows for a lot of flexibility and is easy for instructors to deliver\ncontent,\u201d said Emily Baxter, a learning designer in the John A. Dutton\ne-Education Institute in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s\nstreamlined and has so much functionality for instructors to present\ninformation. Having one place for students to submit assignments is also very\nhelpful.\u201d\n\nKaltura, which works with Zoom to provide a complete conferencing and\nstreaming service to replace Adobe Connect, [debuted this past\nfall](https://news.psu.edu/story/531832/2018/08/16/academics/kaltura-now-\navailable-penn-staters-store-and-stream-media) as part of Penn State\nInformation Technology\u2019s effort to meet the evolving technological, academic\nand communication needs of the Penn State community.\n\nAs technology increasingly integrates with every facet of higher education,\nvideo and digital literacy tools have become essential for universities to\ncompete in 21st-century classrooms, incorporating technology into the\ncurriculum and building skills that students are embracing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see our faculty take advantage of Kaltura\u2019s ability to\nempower digital innovation,\u201d said Jennifer Sparrow, senior director of\nTeaching and Learning with Technology. \u201cIt presents them with a multitude of\nways to deliver coursework in engaging and meaningful practice.\u201d\n\nMultimedia content with a purpose\n\nThe nature of Coughlin\u2019s class relies heavily on demonstration. Kaltura has\nhelped him break down, in a step-by-step format, his programming process.\n\nIn the past, Coughlin said he would hand out copies of a finished program,\npages of documents loaded with codes and comments explaining the steps he took\nto get to the final product. Kaltura\u2019s screen capture capabilities have\nrendered the old method somewhat obsolete.\n\n\u201cWith that approach, they can\u2019t see the progress,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cNow,\nthey\u2019re watching me do this, and hearing my thought process in real time. It\u2019s\nfar more valuable. Much of my classroom instruction focuses on programming\nwith the students. With Kaltura, I can supplement that easily with a\nscreencast where I\u2019m capturing what I\u2019m doing on screen and providing an\nexplanation for what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAll this is made possible by [Kaltura\u2019s\nMediaSpace](https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/), where users can upload files\nthat can then be embedded in Canvas modules by clicking an icon within the\nmodule.\n\nThe ability to quickly embed video has been useful for Coughlin and other\nprofessors who previously used other means to share content in the course\nmanagement system. That usually meant redirecting students to other services\nlike Box.\n\nOne-stop shop\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re designing courses for students, we want everything to be as user-\nfriendly as possible and keep everything in one space as much as possible,\u201d\nBaxter said.\n\nLike Coughlin, Baxter was part of the group that piloted Kaltura last summer.\nShe knew early in the process that it would be a valuable tool.\n\nBaxter is currently working with Susan Trolier-McKinstry, professor of ceramic\nscience and engineering, to build an online course for the summer. That class,\nMaterials Science 512: Principles of Crystal Chemistry, will lean heavily on\nKaltura as Trolier-McKinstry is recording content for 12 lessons, including 10\nvideos per lesson.\n\n\u201cThe future of effective instruction is utilizing online more,\u201d Baxter said.\n\u201cGiving students content that they need, that they can watch using Kaltura\nwhen they\u2019re not in the classroom, is impactful. Now when they are together,\nthat time can be used to engage more deeply and have that learning experience\nbe more active rather than sitting and listening to a lecture.\u201d\n\nMore tricks\n\nKaltura has been helpful for other faculty members who have found value in\nsome of its other features.\n\nMargaret Signorella, a psychology and gender studies professor at Penn State\nBrandywine, has made use of Kaltura\u2019s transcription ability, video quizzes and\nanalytical tracking in her Psych 221 class.\n\nShe\u2019s used videos to supplement lectures before, but no other platform has\nbeen as complete or easy to use as Kaltura.\n\n\u201cThis is something that I\u2019ve been waiting on for quite some time,\u201d Signorella\nsaid. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve had a system to deliver content that\nworks this well.\u201d\n\n## Share this

Video continues to grow as the top\nengagement medium. A new LMS Video Platform launches every so often, hoping to\nmake a dent in a space eager for disruption. We love all-round Open Source\nBigBlueButton, you may not. Kaltura and Panopto seem to gain popularity as of\nrecent. Warpwire or Bongo are examples of niche plays. uQualio aims to become\nso good at video it might want to get you doubt if you need an LMS in the\nfirst place. And will someone else get the last mover advantage?\n\n**This post first appeared in[LMSPulse](https://www.lmspulse.com).**\n\nAs it is the case with relatively complex tech, it is just not possible to\ndraw the best LMS video platform out of the box and see results straight up. I\nwish it was that easy! Strategy, planning and implementation come first, and\nrushing things can simply be frustrating no matter the tool you end up with.\nIt\u2019s okay. All this time we\u2019ve been walking, and video is a motorized vehicle.\nKeep a few basics in check, keep your eyes on the road, and your learners will\nbe set for an amazing trip.\n\nWhat kind of ride do you want to be on?\n\nThink about it for a sec: Do you need a motorcycle, a bus, a monster truck? We\nare still at an early stage of full-fledged, widespread video in learning. It\nmeans the industry has not settled on what the basic standards for an LMS\nvideo platform are. This is a challenge when it comes to choosing the best LMS\nvideo platform for you\n\nIt makes our warnings about the shiny stars in ratings and review sites very\nrelevant. But with this guide, we hope you find the right one.\n\n## YouTube for Schools? Why no video platform it\u2019s a great (and a terrible)\nidea\n\nThe best LMS Video Platforms are the one that cater to your needs. Which begs\nan obvious question: What do you need? Do you even need one right now? It\ndepends on how prominent video features in your learning and business\nstrategy. If you don\u2019t have one yet, and all you want is to explore the\npossibilities of video in education, keep it simple.\n[YouTube](https://news.elearninginside.com/youtube-channels-edtech-2019/),\nVimeo or [TeacherTube](https://www.teachertube.com/video/frog-dissection-\ninstructions-155411) will do fine.\n\nSo how deep does your video platform urge go? Let\u2019s find out:\n\n### First floor: I just want to share some cool videos with my students\n\nWant to find the perfect TED Talk YouTube can offer? I hear there is always\none. Show the [great, introductory \u201c101\u201d series by\nNatGeo](https://www.youtube.com/user/NationalGeographic/search?query=101)?\nTalk about the latest in space exploration and how it relates to your\nclassroom subject? [Cat videos for\nkids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cat+videos+for+education&sp=CAMSBAgFEAE%253D)?\n(For a debate on their social and cultural implications, of course.)\n\nNo need for anything else than a link to the video. Most modern LMS today\nautomatically embed the video on the page. In this case, an additional\nplatform for a popular video site like YouTube could actually undermine the\nexperience for your students. If they are frequent users they can add your\nvideos to their playlist and watch it on the mobile app, even when they are\noffline. YouTube media production tools are superior too. Video analytics have\nno match. This also applies to the app. You can monetize your content, or\nrestrict it. You have to let them store your content. But so do most other\nplatforms.\n\n### Second floor: I want to make and share videos quickly, maybe encourage my\nstudents too\n\nOn this floor, built-in video and audio recording are LMS essentials. Some\nplugins or add-ons can give you an extra oomph in bells, whistles, speed and\nperformance.\n\nBut wait! If all you want is to record yourself on a webcam for your students,\nlet me interest you in live conferencing tools! In terms of simplicity and\nquality, BigBlueButton is a safe and sound choice. At least stack yor choice\nagainst its features. (In terms of price too: BBB is open source and you can\ndeploy it on your server for free.)\n\nNow, if you want your students to record themselves, social media is becoming\nthe default choice. Instagram is currently edging in teen popularity. YouTube\ncan also be considered a social network, in fact second only to Facebook in\ntotal traffic. Video-only social network TikTok, a is growing, especially in\nAsia. But its future is uncertain. ([Remember\nVine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tech-whiz-behind-vine-and-hq-trivia-\nmade-millions-in-his-20s-he-was-dead-by-34-11550283078)? Neither do we.)\n\n### Third floor: I want to build a content library for easy video deployment\n\nThen this is the guide for you. Your choice will be down to your budget,\ndesired features and needs. Read the next section for some basic requirements\nand features you might want to be aware of, and how some popular solutions\nfare.\n\n### Fourth floor: I want a platform that helps me align my video strategy with\nmy operational goals\n\nNow we are talking! Welcome to the highest floor, where you are one of few\nguests. You want LMS Data, Analytics dashboards, recommender systems and other\nnext-gen solutions. The sky is the limit. This guide might be too basic for\nyou, and so could be the bespoke solutions in our list. You might want to\nreach out to an experience partner with consulting experience.\n\n## LMS Video Platform factors and features really worth your attention\n\nSome are more obvious than others. Feel free to chose, disregard and give them\nmore or less weight at your leisure. In fact, [a \u201crubric\u201d\napproach](http://lmspulse.com/2017/moodle-rubrics-101-understand-design-\ndeploy-them-in-moodle/) could come handy.\n\n### Cost\n\nThe lack of standards for LMS video platforms makes cost comparisons very\nconfusing. It makes the link between per-user price and feature set very hard.\nA fact vendors may use to their advantage. As a result, marketing ends up\nbeing the main source of customer education.\n\n### Creator Experience\n\nI admit it. The following three factors are not as clear-cut as you might need\nthem to be. The truth is, there is a known issue that affects platforms as\nthey must serve a higher number of diverse users. Flexibility is key. But then\nthe challenge is making more features easy to use without crowding your\nscreen. This diversity persists within user types.\n\nIt is not expected that a majority of the users in a platform become creators.\nYet the few who do should expect for simple upload and editing options.\n\nYou will be hard pressed to find a video platform that excels at video\nproduction and is good enough at the others. Professional video makers would\nnot replace their high-caliber tools.\n\n### Curator Experience\n\nIt is common for video platforms to advertise themselves as \u201cLibraries.\u201d\nMeaning this one should be one of the feature at which they excel. A \u201ccurator\u201d\nis most likely a teacher, but other users could play the role. A basic feature\nset includes, but is not limited to:\n\n  * Easy pick and choose videos to save into folders or playlists.\n  * Quick search, ideally with operators and comprehensive filters.\n  * Metadata: Allow to edit title, description, tags and keywords.\n  * Sharing and controlling who can see the curation.\n\n### Learner Experience\n\nAnother essential set of components. Look out for features such as:\n\n  * Easy loading and playback. Big, beautiful buttons is not asking too much.\n  * Track watched videos. Resuming where they left off a previous session is a great plus.\n  * Easy bandwith throttling. Use the video\u2019s best resolution whenever possible. But convert to lower to keep the user from guessing.\n  * Optionally: \u201cStar\u201d videos or save them as favorites.\n\n### Compliance\n\nA method to handle DRM (Digital Rights Management) issues is a must in this\nreality. The same goes for manual or automatic content moderation tools. The\nideal platform is one that makes you worry as little as possible about these\nissues.\n\nBut there is a warning to be made about about excessively controlling\nplatforms. The current \u201cCopystrike\u201d system is the bane of a YouTube creator\u2019s\nexistence. Arbitrary \u201cdemonetization\u201d is a [growing fear for the best\neducational YouTube channels, even the most original and user-\nsafe](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121370/youtube-advertising-revenue-\ncreators-demonetization-earnings-google).\n\n### Accessibility\n\nWe cannot stress this enough. Accessible content is good for everyone, and\nit\u2019s good for business. Hopefully your video platform is aware of it.\n\nIn practical terms, it can mean:\n\n  * Closed caption support. Automated subtitle generation would be ideal.\n  * Compliance, starting with WCAG 2.0.\n  * Compatiblity with assistive devices. (Accomplished mostly by the previous item.)\n  * High-contrast menu options.\n\n### Support\n\nGood customer support is essential for solutions that provide their own\nhosting platform. It\u2019s also the reason why high-level LMS-Video platform\nvendor partnerships are so popular. These allow you, for example, get support\nfor both plaftorms through the same medium.\n\n### Offline access, mobile access, or mobile app\n\nOne-level beyond throttling features, offline access can be a godsend. Ability\nto download videos is an obvious solution. This, unfortunately, can run into\nDRM and other compliance issues.\n\nIs your learning closer to classical, direct instruction? Make sure this is\nsomething your community actually needs, as it can be an expensive feature.\nConversely, hybrid or blended learningtechniques, including [flipped\nclassroom](https://news.elearninginside.com/flipped-learning/), could find\nthese a wortwhile addition.\n\n## Top LMS Video Platforms in 2020\n\nThe following solution more or less comply with the basic features mentioned\nbefore. They are known to work with with the top LMS (Canvas, Blackboard and\nMoodle). Kaltura, Panopto and BigBlueButton also support REST API and video\nanalytics.\n\n### Apereo Opencast\n\nBy the creators of Sakai LMS, Opencast is a flexible, Open Source solution to\ncapture, process, manage and deliver video. Its high level of flexibility\nmakes it valuable for basically every use case, but its adoption is hindered\nby the great deal of customization it requires to get it started. Properly set\nup, however, it\u2019s capable of highly effective workflows and metadata-rich\nrepositories of content to deliver seamlessly across YouTube as well as any\nAPI-compatible platform.\n\n### uQualio\n\n[uQualio](https://www.uqualio.com/) flips the script, by enticing you into an\nLMS by way of a compelling video experience. Pedagogically thoughtful, it\ncomes with a set of tools intended to increase the effectiveness of your video\nlessons: Bite-sizing, gamification and interactivity are only its more visible\nfeatures. It aims to solve the perennial problem of user onboarding. You might\nend up seeing lots of uQualio-hosted videos across landing pages promoting new\nsoftware! It is without a doubt one of the most comprehensive new tools in\ntown.\n\n### Kaltura and Kaltura Community Edition\n\nKaltura can refer two things. One is the Open Source application, named\nKaltura Community Edition Video Platform. (Also known as Kaltura SE.) It\u2019s\nfree to download and easy to deploy, customize and integrate via API. You can\nfind more at [kaltura.org](https://www.kaltura.org/).\n\nThen there\u2019s Kaltura Corporate Solutions for Education. They include features\nlike cloud-hosted libraries and repositories, or lesson capture. Kaltura\nMediaspace is the ready-made hub to showcase corporate video, hassle free.\n[Kaltura CaptureSpace Desktop Recorder](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/kaltura-\ncapturespace-user-guide-0), an application for Windows and Mac, comes free. It\nsupports up to 4 multiple-stream recording. For Moodle, you can integrate\nKaltura to the LMS using the plugin family build at Yamaguchi University. They\nare compatible with both free and premium license, but they are unofficial and\nunsupported by Kaltura.\n\n### Panopto\n\nSelf-claimed enterprise video leader Panopto is another \u201cVideo CMS.\u201d It also\noffers cloud storage and streaming. Added-value features include custom case\nexamples. (Flipped Classroom seems to be one of [its big\nplays](https://www.panopto.com/panopto-for-education/flipped-classroom/).)\nPanopto admits to be built for the \u201chigh end\u201d spectrum of organizations, in\nterms of video usage and budgets. Only those with ambitious implementations of\nvideo capture, storage and continuous delivery will see the benefits of a\nPanopto implementation. User friendly interfaces, deep analytics and seamless\nintegrations are some of the features Panopto wants to be known for. Examples\nof successful use of Panopto include Yale University, The Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University throught its flipped classroom practice; the Hong Kong\nAcademy for Performing Arts, and the National University of Singapore (NUS),\nwhich records every lecture taught at any classroom on campus, every student\ndiscussion, and every office hours session.\n\nI first learned about Panopto [thanks to a\nlink](https://upenn.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=44ae3992-cfff-4a76-ab1e-a9ed012168b0)\nto the incredible Child Poverty and Neuroscience in a Global Context\nconference. The event was [hosted by UPenn\u2019s Center for Neuroscience &\nSociety](https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/event/child-poverty-and-brain-\ndevelopment-in-global-context/)while a full recording is hosted by Panopto\nUPenn cloud. I wish I knew how to download Panopto videos! The institution can\nset the content public, Panopto login users only, or private. So while\n\u201cPanopto UW\u201d can offer you some interesting content, \u201cPanopto Duke\u201d or\n\u201cPanopto UIowa\u201d may not.\n\n### Bongo (Formerly YouSeeU)\n\n\u201cVideo assessment and soft skill development platform\u201d Bongo\n\nThis \u201cVideo Assessment Platform\u201d just became the third Moodle Premium\nIntegrator, and second second to BigBlueButton for video solution. While it\nfocuses on video assigments and soft skills development, it offers many\nfeatures found on general-purpose platforms. Live virtual classrooms or group\nsessions are an example.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Bongo and the Moodle integration\nopportunities, [check out this webinar on March\n13](https://www.moonami.com/webinar-bongo-2/).\n\n### Warpwire\n\nUp-and-coming [video platform Warpwire](https://www.warpwire.com/) has a\nsurprisingly extensive feature set, including third-party authentication\n([OAuth 2.0](http://lmspulse.com/tag/oauth2/)), batch upload, throttling, in-\nvideo caption search, and lots more. Moodle Partner eCreators CEO claims\nWarpwire \u201cis lightweight but packs a serious punch.\u201d in a press release\nannouncing a key partnership.\n\n### Arc (Canvas exclusive)\n\n\u201cWe are still working on a civility filter.\u201d Actual quote on the 1\u201902\u201d mark.\n\nThoroughly hyped \u201cnext-generation online video learning platform\u201d Arc offers\ndrag-and-drop functionality to embed video into online lessons. Students can\ncomment on the video as they watch. Teacher can follow video behavior and\nchoose a different video if necessary.\n\n## Bonus: Free and Open video repositories worth checking out\n\n**The Open Video Project**. Its interface is a legacy of the dial-up era. And\nperhaps its Mission alludes to a simpler time, too. One where unbridled access\nto the world\u2019s information would be at everyone\u2019s doorsteps. Reminisce about\nyour youthful internet ideals in the [founding paper\nabstract](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336597.336693), published at the\nProceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries in 2000. Then\ncheck out some free vids at [open-video.org](https://open-video.org/).\n\n**OER Commons Video Selection**. The largest and boldest directory of Open\nEducational Resources we know lets you filter by format type. [Nearly 10\nthousand items in video\nformat](https://www.oercommons.org/browse?batch_size=20&sort_by=visits&view_mode=list&f.media_formats=video)\n(at writing) can be filtered by a broad criteria set, from language and\nsubject to educational standards. (Common Core included.)\n\n**Archive.org Moving Image Archive**. A comprehensive repository, often the\nonly source for many public domain media, is [the video section of this\nproject](https://archive.org/details/movies) led by nonprofit The Internet\nArchive. Also known as the Wayback Machine. It lists 4 million videos, 1.6 of\nthem are [TV news shows](https://archive.org/details/tv) from recent and past\nhistory.\n\n**The Public Domain Review Film Collection.** A [non-comprehensive, but aptly\ncurated selection](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/?medium=film) of\nitems owned by all humanity, that at one time were deemed either curious or\nwondrous by the volunteer staff. Find 122 film, mostly old movie.\n\n**This post first appeared in[LMSPulse](https://www.lmspulse.com).**\n\n_Featured Image: Miss Zhang, Unsplash._\n\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.elearninginside.com%2Fhow-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020%2F)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20To%20LMS%3A%20Video%20%E2%80%94%20Best%20Video%20Learning%20Platforms%20of%202020&url=https://news.elearninginside.com/how-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020/&via=elearninginside)[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?trk=How+To+LMS%3A+Video+%E2%80%94+Best+Video+Learning+Platforms+of+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.elearninginside.com%2Fhow-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020%2F)Post[Post](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.elearninginside.com%2Fhow-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020%2F&title=How+To+LMS%3A+Video+%E2%80%94+Best+Video+Learning+Platforms+of+2020)\n\n[Share](https://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.elearninginside.com%2Fhow-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020%2F&t=How+To+LMS%3A+Video+%E2%80%94+Best+Video+Learning+Platforms+of+2020)[Share](https://bufferapp.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.elearninginside.com%2Fhow-\nto-lms-video-best-video-learning-platforms-\nof-2020%2F&text=How+To+LMS%3A+Video+%E2%80%94+Best+Video+Learning+Platforms+of+2020)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n[![](https://news.elearninginside.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1280px-\nmcgraw-\nhill_ed_sign_2-e1564583286193-230x174.jpg)](https://news.elearninginside.com/pushback-\nagainst-cengage-and-mcgraw-hill-merger-what-is-at-stake-and-what-comes-next/)\n\n###### [Pushback Against Cengage and McGraw-Hill Merger: What Is at Stake and\nWhat Comes Next?](https://news.elearninginside.com/pushback-against-cengage-\nand-mcgraw-hill-merger-what-is-at-stake-and-what-comes-next/)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n[![](https://news.elearninginside.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/emile-\nperron-190221-unsplash-230x174.jpg)](https://news.elearninginside.com/sas-and-\ncoursera-launch-new-program/)\n\n###### [SAS and Coursera Launch New\nProgram](https://news.elearninginside.com/sas-and-coursera-launch-new-\nprogram/)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n[![](https://news.elearninginside.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/photo-1522202757859-7472b0973c69-230x174.jpg)](https://news.elearninginside.com/wgu-\nohio-faces-a-legislative-challenge/)\n\n###### [WGU Ohio Faces a Legislative\nChallenge](https://news.elearninginside.com/wgu-ohio-faces-a-legislative-\nchallenge/)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n[![](https://news.elearninginside.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/augmented-\nreality-elearning-230x174.jpg)](https://news.elearninginside.com/augmented-\nreality-transforms-elearning/)\n\n###### [Augmented Reality Transforms\neLearning](https://news.elearninginside.com/augmented-reality-transforms-\nelearning/)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n[![](https://news.elearninginside.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/22947137613_766b3c5eb9_o-230x174.png)](https://news.elearninginside.com/contained-\nopen-source-environments-compatible-with-everything-what-elearning-\nprofessionals-should-know-about-docker/)\n\n###### [Contained, Open Source Environments Compatible With Everything?

After\nbrainstorming with campus instructional and multimedia designer Mary Ann\nMengel, the Innovative Instructional Technologies in the Classroom FLC was\nborn, and the plan is to continue it through the 2019-20 academic year for\nexisting members and broaden the reach for additional interested faculty.\n\n\u201cI am enthusiastic about incorporating technology into my classroom,\u201d Pfeifer\nReitz said. \"My goal was to meet faculty across our campus and talk with\nlikeminded folks interested in incorporating tech into teaching.\"\n\nSince September 2018, the FLC group of 11 members would meet every three weeks\nto talk about an assigned book and lessons learned. At the end of each\nmeeting, a member volunteered to [write a blog post about what they\ndiscussed](https://sites.psu.edu/teachtechinnovate/).\n\n\u201cOne theme that we discussed early on focused on the challenge of designing\ncourses that provide students space to exercise creativity,\u201d Wang said. In\nWang\u2019s senior-level laboratory in molecular genetics course in the spring, his\nstudents created final projects using a variety of media, from a Facebook page\nfor a fictional researcher to a whodunit graphic novella, all of which were\nbased upon a molecular cloning and phylogeny project. Students showed an\nincreased interest when creating and crafting their projects, and a rise in\nengagement was exhibited through the final week of classes.\n\nJenifer Shannon, a lecturer in electrical engineering, is another FLC member\nwho has seen success from applying ideas discussed during the group\u2019s\nmeetings. She began developing strategies to incorporate interactive online\nmaterials to her lecture content including using Kaltura for video editing,\ninteractive video quizzes, and providing students with more time in the lab.\n\n\"The diversity of our members' academic backgrounds contributes to an exciting\nand fruitful FLC group,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cWe bounce our ideas off each other and\noffer encouragement and suggestions.\u201d\n\nThanks to the FLC and support from Mengel, Pfeifer Reitz has implemented a\nmore formal way for students to use Zoom to enhance their listening skills.\nShe has introduced a \u201cpersuasive Zoom review\u201d into her classes, where students\ndeliver persuasive speeches, watch each other\u2019s speeches, then hold recorded\nmeetings through Zoom to give each other feedback.\n\nAfterward, Pfeifer Reitz evaluates their Zoom reviews based upon how well they\nmet the requirements of the assignment. Each student is required to provide\nfeedback on their partner\u2019s speech, consider the feedback and ask two to three\nfollow-up questions, and the entire Zoom meeting should be four to five\nminutes, with two to two and a half minutes allocated per student.\n\nPfeifer Reitz said, \"FLC groups like these are invaluable. The concept of the\n'critical friend'\u2014developing collegial relationships, encouraging reflective\npractice, and rethinking process together\u2014helps make all of us better at what\nwe do in our own classrooms.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT)\nFaculty Learning Community (FLC) for Innovative Instructional Technology in\nthe Classroom,

Even at a 2-rig program, Seneca will see production growth of nearly\n15% next year and single-digits the following year,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cAs of\nfiscal 2019, we have now produced over 1 Tcf of gas from our shale acreage in\nPennsylvania. Any further activity changes will obviously be dependent on\npricing.\u201d\n\nHe updated progress on drilling in the Utica shale formation as well.\n\n\u201cOur latest Utica pad located in Rich Valley (Elk / Cameron counties) has now\nbeen online for over three months,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cFour out of the five wells\non this pad are performing above expectations and they are our best to-date in\nthe WDA. Including this pad, we are now producing from 11 wells along the\nsouthern boundary of the Clermont Rich Valley (CRV) area with 10 of these\nwells producing above our expected averages.\u201d\n\nBoulware said that owning all of the infrastructure used in Seneca\u2019s gathering\nprocess has proved a significant economic advantage to National Fuel.\n\n\u201cSeneca\u2019s operational success continues to directly benefit our gathering\nsegment which, on the strength of record throughput, saw a revenue growth of\napproximately 18% over last year. We expect future gathering throughput will\ngrow in lockstep with Seneca\u2019s production, which should translate into annual\nrevenue growth of approximately 10% on average in the near-term.\u201d\n\nWhile companies in the region have been struggling with approvals for\npipelines needed to transport their product, National Fuel has had some\nsuccess there as well.\n\n###  More from this section\n\n[ ![Bradford church adopts nickname: \u2018The B-Free\nChurch\u2019](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n](/bradford/bradford-church-adopts-nickname-the-b-free-\nchurch/article_81a022fe-1240-5282-b273-c4ba20a423f3.html)\n\n####  [ Bradford church adopts nickname: \u2018The B-Free\nChurch\u2019](/bradford/bradford-church-adopts-nickname-the-b-free-\nchurch/article_81a022fe-1240-5282-b273-c4ba20a423f3.html)\n\n[ ![DAV Transportation Network taking precautions due to\nvirus](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n](/bradford/dav-transportation-network-taking-precautions-due-to-\nvirus/article_a95fe223-e737-591d-b686-81dec24358e0.html)\n\n####  [ DAV Transportation Network taking precautions due to\nvirus](/bradford/dav-transportation-network-taking-precautions-due-to-\nvirus/article_a95fe223-e737-591d-b686-81dec24358e0.html)\n\n[ ![Wolf asks manufacturers to switch to making medical\nsupplies](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n](/news/local/wolf-asks-manufacturers-to-switch-to-making-medical-\nsupplies/article_8d439264-fa6a-5d47-b62d-0f8db978435c.html)\n\n####  [ Wolf asks manufacturers to switch to making medical\nsupplies](/news/local/wolf-asks-manufacturers-to-switch-to-making-medical-\nsupplies/article_8d439264-fa6a-5d47-b62d-0f8db978435c.html)\n\n\u201cWhile you have likely heard about many pipeline projects that have stalled,\nNational Fuel\u2019s Line N extension to Monaca came online during the last fiscal\nquarter,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cLine N ties the National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation\nsystem to Shell\u2019s $6 billion petrochemical facility in Beaver County, Pa. This\nwas approximately a $24.5 million investment.\u201d\n\nPart of the holdings of Seneca Resources is Highland Field Services, a water\nlogistics company that manages the handling of a substantial portion of fluids\nused in Seneca\u2019s operations. The facility is permitted by the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection and includes a centralized storage facility, a\ntreatment plant and a pipeline delivery network. It serves to reduce the\namount of freshwater used in Seneca\u2019s operations.\n\nSeneca has plans to expand it as well.\n\n\u201cWe expect to announce an expansion of our Mount Jewett / Kane facility in\n2020 that will include a $20 million capital investment in the region,\u201d\nBoulware said. \u201cThe investment could increase over the next five years\ndepending on market conditions and position Highland as the premier water\nhandler in the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nHe explained that throughout 2019, Seneca hosted over 100 students,\nprofessors, government officials, journalists and industry personnel for tours\nof Seneca facilities in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the 2020 tour season to provide new visitors with a deeper\nunderstanding of the science behind the operations, the various safety and\nenvironmental controls utilized, and the importance of the energy industry,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nFor anyone interested in seeing what construction of a shale wellpad looks\nlike, Seneca has an answer.\n\n\"If you're interested in doing a tour from the comfort of your home or office,\nwe have partnered with Penn State's Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research\n(MCOR) to present the first (and only) time-lapse video of well construction\nfrom start to finish,\" he said.

People are consuming media that is produced by independent creatives\non free platforms, like YouTube. [Verasity](https://verasity.io/) could be the\nnext killer app in the world of monetizing media online.\n\nThere has been a shift in how media is created and monetized. The people who\nmake online media aren't in a good position, and the major platforms make\nloads of money. Verasity has a solution that could help advertisers and\ncreatives.\n\nWith Verasity advertisers would be sure that their message was connecting with\nits target audience, and media consumers could also benefit from the\nadvertising they watch. Media creators would also be able to gain more from\nthe advertising that their works promote.\n\nMore money for creators means more media, which is good for everyone.\n\n![Verasity](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/verasity-1024x682.jpg)\n\n## Verasity Fixes a Broken Model\n\nContents\n\n  * 1 Verasity Fixes a Broken Model\n  * 2 The Risks of New Infrastructure\n  * 3 Verasity Works With the System\n  * 4 One Wallet, Many Platforms\n  * 5 Verasity Puts The Media Ecosystem First\n    * 5.1 Advertisers\n    * 5.2 Viewers\n    * 5.3 Media Creators\n  * 6 Conclusion\n  * 7 Useful Links\n\nThere are numerous issues with online advertising. One of the biggest problems\nfor advertisers is the fact that they can pay for advertising, but due to ad\nblocking software, their message never reaches its audience.\n\nThe situation is just as difficult for media consumers. If you watch videos on\nthe internet, your personal data is going to be collected, and likely sold by\nthe platform. A website like YouTube charges companies to advertise and then\ncollects users' personal data as well.\n\n![The Problem](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/problem.jpg)\n\nFor a platform like YouTube, the status quo in online advertising is a dream\ncome true. No matter what the platform will make money, even if its users\naren't seeing the message they are being paid to distribute.\n\nVerasity has the answer to this problem and has created a system that will\ninterface with the most popular existing media platforms.\n\n## The Risks of New Infrastructure\n\nThere is no shortage of new blockchain-powered video platforms that are trying\nto fix the problem described above. Unfortunately, it is very hard to get\npeople to leave a platform once they have gotten used to using it.\n\nVerasity is clued into this problem and built its app to function with\nYouTube, Twitch, Kaltura, VideoJS, Flowplayer, Vimeo, JWPlayer, Brightcove,\nand Ooyala.\n\n![Video](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/video.jpg)\n\nIf you add all the traffic those platforms handle up, you would be looking at\n95% of the videos that run on the internet. That makes Verasity's app a\ncontender for large-scale media monetization and a big advantage for online\nadvertisers.\n\n## Verasity Works With the System\n\nInstead of wondering if their message is getting through to its target\naudience, advertisers would know who is watching their ads. Creatives are also\nset to benefit Verasity's app, which would help viewers know that watching ads\nonline was worth their time.\n\nIn many ways, the mega media platforms that have emerged over the last decade\nare holding creatives back. While there have been a few big success stories in\nthe YouTuber arena, very few people have been able to transcend the platform.\n\nA platform like YouTube has a tremendous amount of power over what can, and\ncannot be said online. This has been demonstrated a few times over the last\ntwo years. No matter what you might think about the wild ideas that some\npeople talk about online, the fact that the platform has more power than the\ncreatives and audience is concerning.\n\n![Solution](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/solution.jpg)\n\nVerasity gives creatives a lot more power in the area of monetization. Instead\nof being controlled by the whims of the platform, their earning power would be\nindependent of any specific website. While a platform could remove a\ncreative's content, there would be no way for the platform to 'demonetize'\ncontent in the same way that exists now.\n\n## One Wallet, Many Platforms\n\nVerasity's app creates one wallet for media creators, regardless of the\nplatform. The app unites all the loyalty and rewards programs into one wallet\nand gives advertisers the ability to connect directly with viewers.\n\nBy working within the existing online framework, Verasity has a much better\nchance of creating real change in the online media economy. Think about it\nfrom the perspective of a creator. If you make a great podcast or even a\nmovie, you have no idea how much a platform could be making from your media.\n\nDirect sales of media are possible, but the 'free' distribution model that\nrelies on advertising has shown itself to be extremely effective. This puts\ncreatives in a sticky situation. If creatives use free platforms like YouTube,\nthey are likely to gain viewers, but making money from the media is much\nharder.\n\nDespite all the flaws with the current model, there is a lot of great media\nout there. Verasity could be the next step in growing the online media creator\nbusiness model and help the online media space become more transparent for\neveryone involved.\n\n![Ecosystem](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/ecosystem.jpg)\n\n## Verasity Puts The Media Ecosystem First\n\nDesigning realistic solutions takes a lot of skill. Verasity has created a new\napp that may be able to renew the entire online media revenue model because it\nis so simple to integrate with the existing online video distribution\ninfrastructure.\n\nVerasity's app offers something to everyone in the online media ecosystem,\nespecially those who have been overlooked by the current system.\n\n### Advertisers\n\nOne of the hardest things for an advertiser is knowing that the message they\ncraft is kitting the demographic they need to connect with.\n\nVerasity's app is simple for online advertisers to start using, and it could\nhelp them if it is adopted on a wider scale. Knowing that an ad budget is well\nspent helps ad companies maintain their professional relationships, and show\ntheir clients that the message is hitting home.\n\n### Viewers\n\nDealing with ads isn't a lot of fun for media consumers.\n\nAd blocking software is an easy way out, but it undermines the business model\nof 'free' media platforms. Add to that the fact that personal data is\ncollected and sold, and it isn't hard to see why today's media consumers feel\njilted by the whole system.\n\nVerasity's app creates new levels of accountability and transparency in the\nonline advertising arena. Keeping track of data is much easier, and there is\nlittle gray area because of blockchain's remarkable record keeping ability.\n\n### Media Creators\n\nOut of all the areas that will benefit from Verasity's app, media creators\nprobably stand to make the most in terms of financial returns. A direct\npayment system for media creators will help make new and bigger projects a\nreality, which is great for media consumers, and also advertisers who will be\nable to use the media to attract more attention!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerasity has a good idea, which is ready to go live. The fact that the\nVerasity app is able to monetize content on the world's biggest media\nplatforms is a big plus from an adoption perspective.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Verasity, or how its app could help you, check\nout their website [right here](https://verasity.io/). Once media creators are\nable to gain more from their work, it is likely we will see a new era in\nonline media creation.\n\nWith more and more people looking to 'free' media platforms for entertainment,\nVerasity has set itself up as a very promising blockchain company in a rapidly\ngrowing market.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n  * [Official Website](https://verasity.io/)\n  * [Official Blog](https://medium.com/verasity)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/verasitytech)\n  * [Facebook](https://facebook.com/verasitytech)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/verasity/)\n  * [Telegram](https://t.me/verasitychat)\n\n2,739\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://blockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/etoro.gif)](/out/etoro)\n\n[Advertise Here](https://blockonomi.com/advertise/)\n\n* * *\n\n0\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblockonomi.com%2Fverasity-\nvideo-rewards%2F \"Share on\nFacebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockonomi.com%2Fverasity-\nvideo-rewards%2F&text=What%20is%20Verasity%3F%20Attention-\nBased%20Platform%20for%20Video%20Rewards \"Share on\nTwitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockonomi.com%2Fverasity-\nvideo-rewards%2F\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockonomi.com%2Fverasity-\nvideo-rewards%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fblockonomi-9fcd.kxcdn.com%2Fwp-\ncontent%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2Fverasity.jpg&description=What%20is%20Verasity%3F%20Attention-\nBased%20Platform%20for%20Video%20Rewards \"Pinterest\")\n\n![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/866db745873e685786d73f56a964b5cd?s=82&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAuthor [Nicholas Say](https://blockonomi.com/author/nick/ \"Posts by Nicholas\nSay\")\n\nNicholas Say was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Fee](/author/jessica-fee/)2013-06-14 12:44:00 UTC\n\nDeloitte\n[predicts](http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GX/global/industries/technology-\nmedia-telecommunications/tmt-predictions-2013/tmt-\npredictions-2013-technology/8925e716bfcdb310VgnVCM3000003456f70aRCRD.htm#.UbnsNvmR98E)\nover 90% of Fortune 500 companies will have partially or fully implemented an\nenterprise social network by the end of 2013. An ESN is an internal workplace\nthat streamlines communication among co-workers. They give employees a sense\nof online community and help forge connections between departments, especially\nwithin larger corporations.\n\n**\n\nSEE ALSO:[10 Free iPhone Apps You\u2019ll Use Every\nDay](https://mashable.com/2012/02/10/free-iphone-apps-every-day/)\n\n**\n\nWe've highlighted a selection of social networks aimed at businesses. Does\nyour company use an ESN? Does that network make communication more effective?\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments section below and your response\ncould be featured in next week's [top\ncomments](https://mashable.com/2013/06/08/game-of-thrones-top-comments/).\n\n##  1\\. [Tibbr](http://tibbr.com/)\n\nDeveloped by TIBCO Software, Tibbr is optimized for seamless use on your\ndesktop or mobile device. The profile layout is similar to\n[Facebook](https://mashable.com/category/facebook/), with space to list\nprofessional skills, past projects and people you've worked with. You can\nfollow topics, people, apps and project updates, then see who else follows\nsimilar subjects.\n\n![Tibbr is an Enterprise Social Network](https://mondrian.mashable.com/wp-\ncontent%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F06%252FTibbr-640x360.jpg%252Ffull-fit-\nin__1200x2000.jpg?signature=_MLDpcCPr-\nANQn3Ir0hgDdfnpqM=&source=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com)\n\nMy favorite Tibbr feature is the \"Insights\" tab, which provides an overview of\nwhat's happening within your network in a visually dynamic, infographic-style\nlayout.\n\nEnterprise apps like Salesforce, SAP and Oracle are integrated on the social\nnetwork, as well as personal apps like Box, Evernote and LinkedIn (accessible\nthrough the App Marketplace).\n\nTibbr [recently\nintegrated](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239988/Tibco_welcomes_third_party_online_meeting_products_into_its_Tibbr_ESN_suite)\nthird-party meeting and video chat service, so you can use Skype, WebEx or\nGoogle Hangouts directly through the Tibbr interface.\n\nCompanies that use Tibbr include Macy's, iHealth and InterPortPolice.\n\n**Cost:** The price isn't listed on the site, but you can [request a\ndemo](http://www.tibbr.com/contact/) or contact sales directly.\n\n## 2\\. [Jive](http://www.jivesoftware.com/social-business/engage-employees/)\n\nJive is a mobile-ready ESN with similar profile functions. You can follow\npeople, groups and topics on the site. One of the coolest features on Jive is\n\"Recommendations.\" It's similar to Facebook's \"People You May Know,\" but\ninstead, shows profiles of people you _should_ get to know in your company,\nbased on shared interests and related areas of expertise. Its \"Structured\nOutcomes\" feature also makes it easy to tell co-workers which tasks are\ncomplete, and which still need to be finished.\n\n[Companies that use Jive](http://www.jivesoftware.com/customers/) include\nT-Mobile, PWC, UBM and Critical Mass.\n\n**Cost:** The Essentials package costs $12 per user/month, and the Essentials+\npackage costs $18 per user/month. The Enterprise package simply says: [Call\nfor pricing](http://www.jivesoftware.com/try-jive/).\n\n## 3\\. [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/)\n\nYammer is another ESN optimized for desktop and mobile use. Company networks\nare private, so you must have a verified company email in order to join. The\n[UI](https://mashable.com/category/user-interface/) is also similar to\nFacebook, with status updates, pages and \"follow\" capabilities.\n\n![Yammer is a private social media network.](https://mondrian.mashable.com/wp-\ncontent%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F06%252FYammer-640x360.jpg%252Ffull-fit-\nin__1200x2000.jpg?signature=SU4aDc1f9dF8AlqQ75vzXGUOBS4=&source=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com)\n\nWhen [Microsoft purchased Yammer](https://mashable.com/2012/06/25/microsoft-\nconfirms-1-2-billion-yammer-acquisition/) in 2012, it added a feature that\n[detects employees' emotions](https://mashable.com/2012/08/09/microsoft-\nyammer-emotions/) by analyzing sentiments expressed on the network.\n\nCompanies that use Yammer include Shell, 7-Eleven and Razorfish.\n\n**Cost:** Signup for the basic network is free; the _Enterprise Network_ is $3\nper user/month; _Sharepoint online + Yammer_ is $4 per user/month; and _Office\n365 + Yammer_ is $8 per user/month.

For a list of[every\nOVP](http://www.onlinevideo.net/2011/10/every-online-video-platform-ovp-on-\nthe-market-a-reference-list/), look to this [feature from\nOnlineVideo.net](http://www.onlinevideo.net/2011/10/every-online-video-\nplatform-ovp-on-the-market-a-reference-list/)._\n\nWhether you're a small retailer, a regional college, or a major media company,\nchances are good that at some point you'll be working with an online video\nplatform (OVP). But choose carefully because many specialize in different\nareas. A good OVP can do more than just host and serve videos: It will help\nyou create an easy workflow and grow your business.\n\nThe list that follows isn't meant to be comprehensive; even with recent market\nconsolidation, there are still more than 100 OVPs in the marketplace. Rather,\nit's meant to give you a sense of some of the leading OVPs and what\ndifferentiates them from their competitors. Ultimately, you'll want to do your\nhomework, pick a few that seem right for you, then take each one for a test-\ndrive before you make your final decision.\n\n## [Brightcove ](http://www.brightcove.com/en/)\n\nIt might be surprising for an OVP as big as Brightcove, but it's focused on\nease of use and helping even small players get online. It has refined the user\nexperience by offering more customization options, video branding, and simple\nstreaming to mobile devices. It offers plenty of APIs and other tools for\nconnecting to existing workflows, and coding is done with the lightweight\nmarkup language BEML.\n\nThe company launched in 2005. Since it's a SaaS (software-as-a-service)\nsolution, there's no software to be installed, and cross-platform support\nisn't a problem.\n\nBrightcove has found an audience with large media companies, broadcasters,\nnews organizations, and lifestyle publications. Brand marketers, whether\nselling to consumers or businesses, also make up a large portion of the\ncustomer base, as well as governmental, nonprofit, and political groups.\n\nMajor offerings from Brightcove include the three versions of its OVP\nsolutions. Express, which is meant for entry-level customers, starts at $99\nper month and doesn't require an annual commitment. Brightcove Pro, priced in\nthe low- to high-five figures, was rolled out when the company was born.\nFinally, Brightcove Enterprise, which offers multiple account capabilities,\nbegan in 2008.\n\n## [Limelight ](http://www.limelight.com/)\n\nThe OVP formerly known as Delve (until Limelight bought it) stands out for its\nuser experience and workflow. The user interface was designed to be friendly\nand to make it easy to accomplish tasks. When a user uploads a video, he or\nshe can update its metadata and set the channel even before the video is fully\nuploaded. That's a timesaver few can match. It also offers strong analytics\nand APIs.\n\nThe platform's Video Clipper tool makes it easy to shorten videos and works\nwell in combination with Limelight's real-time analytics. If users see that\nviewers are routinely quitting a video at a certain point, they have the\noption of ending the video there.\n\nThe OVP was acquired by Limelight in August 2010. Rather than focusing on just\nthe mobile experience or just analytics, the Limelight Video Platform focuses\non offering the best end-to-end user experience. Since it's now under the same\nroof as a top CDN, it's able to offer tie-ins that others can't. Users gain\nfrom functionality such as player edge scaling, which the video platform is\nable to offer through low-level access to the CDN. Users also get to use\ndeveloper APIs that aren't open to the public.\n\nLimelight's target customers are mid-level or enterprise marketers or media\ncompanies using the OVP to put videos on their public sites or their internal\ntraining sites. The company enjoys wide support from the healthcare, financial\nservices, and media verticals.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the company began offering live streaming, including to\nmobile devices. It recently announced a partnership with Adobe to create that\ncompany's TV Everywhere service, which targets high-end traditional media\ncompanies.\n\n## [Kaltura ](http://corp.kaltura.com/)\n\nKaltura is best known for its open source online video platform, a\ndownloadable solution that delivers all the building blocks that publishers of\nany size need to create channels, deliver video, monetize their content, and\nanalyze the results. It offers a paid solution as well, but many gravitate to\nthe free model, even if setting it up requires a bit of work. More than\n100,000 companies actively use the open source solution, according to Kaltura.\n\nEven if it doesn't directly profit from its free offering, Kaltura still\nbenefits from it. There's an active community of developers working to improve\nthe experience, which Kaltura can use in its commercial offering. By getting\nthat many people involved, it spurs innovation beyond what the company could\ndo in-house.\n\nThe company launched in September 2006 with the goal of becoming the leading\nopen source OVP. It targets four verticals: media and entertainment,\neducation, service providers, and enterprise. The company works with customers\nboth large and small.\n\nThe platform itself launched 2 years ago and includes developer tools for\ncustomizing the experience. Its MediaSpace product is sold as YouTube-in-a-box\nand lets people rapidly create a video portal. MediaSpace launched a year ago.\nFinally, its CMS/LMS integration kits launched 2 years ago. These kits allow\ndevelopers to connect Kaltura to products such as SharePoint or Blackboard--\nsystems that don't handle video well. Kaltura offers 25 integration kits in\nall.\n\n## [Ooyala ](http://www.ooyala.com/)\n\nMention Ooyala and most people think analytics. The company has earned a firm\nfoothold by offering granular data on viewer behavior. While Ooyala has been\nfocused on analytics since it launched in April 2007, it majorly improved its\nabilities when it rebuilt its analytics offering based on the Cassandra data\nstore. Customers can now zoom in on individual videos or even individual\nviewers in real time for either live or on-demand content.\n\nNot surprisingly, major media companies are Ooyala's target customers. It's\nmaking inroads with large broadcasters and print publishers, many of which are\nlooking for ways to monetize their content directly.\n\nOne feature that sets Ooyala apart is its modular offerings. Buyers don't need\nto adopt the entire end-to-end system when using Ooyala, but they can buy only\nthe modules they need. That might mean using only the transcoding engine,\nanalytics, or ad server.\n\nOoyala released its core Backlot system soon after the company's launch at the\nend of 2007. In April 2011, it debuted Ooyala Everywhere, which  \nlets publishers stream to (and generate revenue from) mobile and connected\ndevices. Other releases include a paywall system introduced late in 2010 that\noffers subscription and pay-per-view models and custom integrations with ad\nnetworks.\n\n## [Kyte ](http://www.kitd.com/kyte/)\n\nKyte is one of two OVPs in our guide that used to be independent but are now\nowned by KIT Digital (the other is KickApps). Kyte was acquired in January of\nthis year, and while it still exists as a separate brand, it won't for long.\nIt's in the process of delivering its technology to KIT and will transition to\na part of the KIT Digital brand. There's no firm date when this will happen;\nthe focus is on integrating the technology correctly.\n\nAs it transitions, Kyte will become known as KIT Platform, the OVP for KIT\nDigital's line of solutions. KIT Platform offers three versions: Operator,\nMedia, and Enterprise. They all share an underlying architecture and a modular\nway of working. What customers get depends on their needs. The people behind\nthe platform study those needs and create a custom solution for each client\nthat integrates with its existing workflow.\n\nKIT Platform is aimed at the higher end of the market and already powers some\nof the world's largest and most complex video efforts. Customers include HP\nand Delta Airlines. At the moment, the KIT Platform team is working on a\nsecret multicity deployment in China.\n\nKyte launched in 2008 and never classified itself as an OVP; it provided\nmanaged cloud-based over-the-top services. Though it did present some\nconsumer-level offerings (including one of the first stream-from-mobile-phone\nplatforms), its focus has been on powering complex video solutions: big\ndeployments that require a lot of expertise. Customers include large media and\nentertainment companies. Its focus now is to create a highly interoperable set\nof components that can be used on-site, in the cloud, or in a private cloud.\n\n[Next Page](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-\nArticles/A-Buyers-Guide-to-Online-Video-Platforms-78063.aspx?pageNum=2)\n\n![Streaming\nCovers](https://dzceab466r34n.cloudfront.net/StreamingMedia/TemplateImages/subscribe_magazines_new.png)\n\nFree\n\nfor qualified subscribers\n\n[Subscribe Now](/Subscribe) [Current Issue](/Current_Issue) [Past\nIssues](/Previous_Issue)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\nRelated Articles\n\n[![]()](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-\nArticles/OVPs-Need-to-Simplify-and-Evolve-Heres-\nHow-75872.aspx?utm_source=related_articles&utm_medium=gutenberg&utm_campaign=editors_selection)\n\n###  [OVPs Need to Simplify and Evolve: Here's\nHow](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/OVPs-\nNeed-to-Simplify-and-Evolve-Heres-\nHow-75872.aspx?utm_source=related_articles&utm_medium=gutenberg&utm_campaign=editors_selection)\n\nA Streaming Media East panel made up of both OVP vendors and media powerhouses\nshows what it takes to create a successful video publishing workflow.\n\n06 Jun 2011\n\n[![]()](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-\nArticles/The-411-on-\nOVPs-74286.aspx?utm_source=related_articles&utm_medium=gutenberg&utm_campaign=editors_selection)\n\n###  [The 411 on\nOVPs](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-\nArticles/The-411-on-\nOVPs-74286.aspx?utm_source=related_articles&utm_medium=gutenberg&utm_campaign=editors_selection)\n\nNot all OVPs are alike.

by [Emily Tate](https://edscoop.com/author/emily-tate/ \"Posts by Emily\nTate\")  \nFeb 2, 2018 | EDSCOOP\n\nAfter years of dabbling with open educational resources (OER), educators have\nfinally begun to embrace the concept as a legitimate alternative to\ntraditional publishing and licensed curriculum materials \u2014 and they\u2019re doing\nit in droves.\n\nMore than half of U.S. states \u2014 including Michigan, Indiana, Utah and\nWashington \u2014 are currently developing, or have already developed, digital\nlibraries to house their OER. These states are also now encouraging teachers\nand entire districts to adopt free, openly licensed resources in lieu of\ncostly, often-out-of-date textbooks.\n\nSeemingly overnight, OER has grown from a way to supplement instructional\nmaterials into a global movement \u2014 one whose scope and support are gaining\nmore momentum every day.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve definitely hit an inflection point,\u201d said Lisa Petrides, CEO\nand founder of ISKME (Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in\nEducation), a nonprofit that built and manages OER Commons, one of the largest\nOER platforms on the market. \u201cI think the time has come.\u201d\n\nBecause of the work states are doing with OER, school districts stand to save\nmillions of dollars annually on textbooks. Cost-savings data vary and are not\nbroadly available, but in states like Michigan, for example, one project to\ncreate open, online K-12 social studies textbooks has saved districts over $43\nmillion in just three years \u2014 and that\u2019s just for one subject.\n\nProponents believe OER has the potential to realign the cost structure of\nAmerican schools by allowing districts to reinvest their textbook savings into\nother critical areas, from professional development to technology\ninfrastructure.\n\nA convergence of factors is propelling OER. States have started to [adopt\npolicies](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/state-policy-tracking/) redefining\ntextbook materials and even mandating OER, particularly as the cost of\nreplacing out-of-date textbooks has become more burdensome to America\u2019s nearly\n14,000 school districts. It\u2019s hard to overlook the appeal of free, digital\nalternatives.\n\nHowever, educators say the real appeal of online educational resources is in\nkeeping classroom instruction personalized, relevant and interactive in ways\nthat traditional textbooks never could.\n\nOER is also gaining wider adoption thanks to the near-universal access schools\nnow have to the internet; the explosion of apps making it easy to create,\ndistribute and find digital content; and the emergence of cloud computing that\nmakes it simpler and more affordable for states to gather and host content.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing costs rise, education become less affordable, less accessible,\u201d\nPetrides said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect storm.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s #GoOpen campaign, which was announced in\nOctober 2015, \u201ccertainly did a lot to raise awareness\u201d around OER as well,\nPetrides added.\n\nTeresa Mooney, a program associate with the Council of Chief State School\nOfficers (CCSSO) who works with states on their OER initiatives, said the\nfederal government\u2019s influence helped, but it wasn\u2019t the catalyst.\n\n\u201cThe #GoOpen community is really an important piece of this work and has\nallowed this conversation to thrive, but this movement existed before\n#GoOpen,\u201d Mooney said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say exactly why there is a boom right now,\u201d she added, \"but I think a\nhuge piece of it is that a lot of this work relates to state strategy. OER is\nlinked to equity, high quality and saving money; all of those pieces are\nimportant to states.\u201d\n\nBut the ability for states to tap into emerging cloud-based OER platforms and\nthe national expansion of high-speed broadband have also contributed to the\nnew momentum.\n\nTwo OER platforms in particular \u2014 OER Commons and Amazon Inspire \u2014 are\nproviding schools the ability to access educational content on any device\nthrough any internet browser.\n\nOver 94 percent of U.S. school districts now have access to high-speed\ninternet, according to a 2017 [report](http://edscoop.com/over-6-million-\nstudents-still-lack-high-speed-internet-access-report-finds) from the\nnonprofit EducationSuperHighway. That has paved the way for school districts\nto implement one-to-one initiatives, which equip students with devices that\nare key in accessing those OER platforms.\n\n\u201cOne-to-one programs are a great enabler of digital resources,\u201d Petrides said.\n\u201cIf students have that kind of access to digital resources, it\u2019s going to be\neasier overall\u201d to promote OER.\n\nFrom those one-to-one devices, students can also log in to their district\u2019s\nlearning management system (LMS) to access OER. That\u2019s where a platform like\nOER Commons comes into play. OER Commons features a library of more than\n50,000 free public resources and uses learning tools interoperability (LTI) to\nsupport integration with all the major LMSs, including Canvas, Blackboard,\nGoogle Classroom, Schoology, Moodle and D2L.\n\n\u201cIt makes everything we do as a library much more portable, and that\u2019s really\nwhat we\u2019re trying to do \u2014 get resources to learners who want them,\u201d Petrides\nsaid.\n\nAmazon has also entered the OER market with Amazon Inspire. Available since\nsummer 2017, Inspire is Amazon Education\u2019s repository of completely free and\nopenly licensed digital resources. It resembles the tech company\u2019s online\nshopping site, Amazon.com, in that it allows users to filter, rate and review\nresources on the site.\n\nThe concept behind OER is not particularly new, but the way openly licensed\nresources are used and understood today really emerged over the last 10 to 20\nyears.\n\nIn 2002, [UNESCO coined](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-\ninformation/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/how-has-unesco-\nsupported-oers/) the phrase \u201copen educational resources\u201d to refer to teaching\nmaterials that can be freely used, adapted and distributed by anyone. Around\nthat time, the Hewlett Foundation, and others, began to fund the burgeoning\nfield of OER. It wasn\u2019t long before digital content libraries evolved. ISKME\nbegan beta testing OER Commons, for example, in 2006, and CK-12, another OER\nprovider, was founded in 2007.\n\nEducators, meanwhile, began discovering and experimenting with OER,\ndownloading materials they found on Pinterest or whatever showed up in a\ncursory Google search.\n\nLeaders at the state and district levels, however, began to worry that OER\ncould hamper students\u2019 learning outcomes if the approach wasn\u2019t executed\nthoughtfully. They saw the need to establish parameters around OER \u2014 and\neventually roll out formal statewide initiatives.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened about six years ago, when officials at the Indiana\nDepartment of Education noticed that some districts were beginning to take\nadvantage of digital resources available online. The trend emerged shortly\nafter the Indiana General Assembly passed\n[legislation](http://www.in.gov/legislative/pdf/acts_2011.pdf) in 2011 that\ngave districts the freedom to choose the curriculum they wanted, regardless of\nthe format.\n\nA number of districts used the money they ordinarily spent on traditional\ntextbooks to invest in laptops or tablets for students. But then they weren\u2019t\nadopting new digital curriculum materials.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have new materials, but they also weren\u2019t really sure how to go\nabout curating their own,\u201d said Molly Yowell, digital content coordinator at\nthe Indiana Office of eLearning. \u201cTheir students had these devices, but they\nweren\u2019t really sure how to get started or go about this process responsibly.\u201d\n\nState education department officials realized that if Indiana districts were\ngoing to continue to adopt digital instructional materials, the districts\nwould need guidance. So, long before the U.S. Department of Education launched\nthe #GoOpen campaign to promote OER in U.S. school districts and states,\nIndiana began the work of curating, authoring and organizing what would\neventually become a statewide library of high-quality, standards-aligned open\neducational resources.\n\nIn the years since, the OER movement has continued to take hold in Indiana \u2014\nand in a growing swarm of [other states](https://tech.ed.gov/open/states/),\nincluding Michigan, Utah, Washington, Maryland, Illinois, Georgia, North\nCarolina, Oregon and Wisconsin. These states and others have made formal\ncommitments to promote OER by joining the #GoOpen initiative.\n\nMany have appointed individuals \u2014 and, in some cases, entire teams \u2014 to vet\nand/or create openly licensed materials. They\u2019ve also established repositories\nfor storing and sorting the digital resources.\n\n\u201cThere are so many great digital resources already online; it\u2019s just a matter\nof taking the time to filter through all of the junk and bring forward the\nquality stuff,\u201d Yowell said. \u201cWe want to work smarter, not harder \u2014 which is\nwhy we decided to invest in our teachers and digital content curation.\u201d\n\nWhile each state has taken somewhat different journeys to OER, they have\nsimilar end-goals in mind \u2014 to increase equity; identify relevant, high-\nquality content; and save money. But with different state budgets, different\nstructures, different priorities and different timelines, collaborating with\none another to achieve these goals can be complicated.\n\nWith the help of some unifying organizations \u2014 like the CCSSO and the State\nEducational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) \u2014 states are working\ntogether to exchange ideas, share best practices and eliminate overlap where\npossible.\n\nHere\u2019s how four states are moving forward and in some cases working together\nto make OER an effective alternative to traditional curriculum materials:\n\nMichigan is an example of a state that\u2019s making a decisive commitment to OER.\nSince joining the #GoOpen campaign in February 2016, Michigan education\nofficials have been working toward fulfilling the tenets, which include:\n\n  * Implementing a technology strategy centered on OER.\n  * Developing and maintaining a statewide OER repository.\n  * Building relationships with other states in the #GoOpen community and promoting professional learning.\n\nIn fall 2017, Michigan began building an OER repository, using OER Commons.\nIt's one of three states \u2014 along with Utah and Wisconsin \u2014 establishing a full\n[microsite](https://www.oercommons.org/microsites) through OER Commons. The\nmicrosite, which is expected to go live in March, is a standalone website that\nallows the state to keep some resources private and others public and\navailable to other states.\n\nThe first collection of resources added to the site is from the [Michigan Open\nBook Project](http://textbooks.wmisd.org/index.html). Developed with a grant\nfrom the Michigan Department of Education (MDE), the MI Open Book Project\nproduces a series of open, online K-12 social studies textbooks aligned to\nMichigan standards. It encourages teachers to forgo traditional social studies\ntextbooks and instead use classroom devices to view the learning materials\nfrom the MI Open Book Project.\n\nAs of December 2017, when the MI Open Book Project was three years old, the\ninitiative had generated more than 480,000 downloads and saved educators\nacross the state over $43 million, according to [Ann-Marie\nMapes](http://edscoop.com/edtech-hero-ann-marie-mapes-michigan), an education\ntechnology consultant at the MDE. The money is an important factor, Mapes\nsaid, but it\u2019s not the only factor.\n\n\u201cWe want this [microsite] to be the definitive place where Michigan educators\ncan go to make their lives easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can talk about the savings\nand the money all day when we talk about OER. But this is why we\u2019re doing\nthis.\u201d\n\nWhen the microsite launches this spring, Michigan educators will be able to\nvisit it and see collections of curated resources that were approved for the\nsite.\n\nFor now, department officials are focused on getting confirmation from other\ngroups willing to host their resources on the site. As of January, they\u2019d\nreceived a lot of verbal \u201cyeses\u201d but still need to lock down the details,\nMapes said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s slowly unfolding, and we\u2019re slowly making some headway here as we\nestablish the repository,\u201d she said.\n\nIndiana\u2019s push into OER, meanwhile, has continued to gain momentum.\n\nWhen [Public Law 73](http://www.in.gov/legislative/pdf/acts_2011.pdf) was\nenacted in 2011, Indiana districts for the first time could explore the\npossibilities of using digital content and computer software as a substitute\nfor traditional textbooks. This opened the door for districts to launch one-\nto-one initiatives and access the growing availability of digital\ninstructional materials that could be downloaded on their new classroom\ndevices.\n\nTwo years later, in 2013, the Indiana Department of Education\u2019s Office of\neLearning began guiding districts through the transition from print to digital\nwith a number of professional development programs.\n\nOne year after that, as more districts were launching one-to-one programs and\nwere looking online for OER, a group of 50 teachers and media specialists in\nIndiana came together and formed the Rockstars of Curation. The Rockstars vet\ndigital materials against measures of quality, relevance and state standards.\nThey spend the time combing through educational materials so other teachers in\nIndiana don\u2019t have to.\n\nIn summer 2015, Indiana began conversations with Amazon Education, in\nanticipation of the rollout of the tech company\u2019s forthcoming content\nrepository, Amazon Inspire. State officials were quick to sign on with Amazon,\nknowing that Inspire would be entirely free, easily searchable and developed\nin the likeness of the company\u2019s retail site, Amazon.com.\n\n\u201cIt sounded really exciting to us,\u201d Yowell said. \u201cAmazon is so familiar to so\nmany people. Plus, we trusted the name of Amazon Education.\u201d\n\nThough Amazon Inspire did not become available as soon as expected \u2014 it was\nlaunched in June 2016, then pulled back into invitation-only beta to tackle\ncopyright concerns before [relaunching in July\n2017](http://edscoop.com/amazon-relaunches-inspire-after-a-year-of-re-tooling)\n\u2014 Indiana [remained loyal](http://edscoop.com/behind-one-group-of-educators-\nexperience-creating-amazon-inspire) to the company, as did Maryland\u2019s and\nOregon\u2019s education departments.\n\nCurrently, the Rockstars, with the Office of eLearning, have uploaded 800\ndigital resources to Inspire \u2014 [searchable by\n\u201cINeLearn\u201d](https://www.amazoninspire.com/search?query=INeLearn#resource_owner_id=220&resource_owner_type=ORGANIZATION)\n\u2014 with plans to add many more.\n\nUtah education officials are already moving from their first OER system to a\nsecond. Over the next six months, state officials will be transferring digital\nresources out of EQUELLA \u2014 the online education repository from Pearson \u2014 and\ninto an OER Commons microsite.\n\nThe microsite will allow Utah to keep both its licensed digital materials and\nits OER in the same place. The OER will be available to anyone, anywhere, at\nno cost, while the premium, licensed content will only be viewable by Utahns\nwith special login credentials.\n\nUtah was an early adopter of digital educational resources, but it wasn\u2019t\nuntil about three years ago, when OER really started to gain traction, that\nthe state added openly licensed materials to its collections.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting to me is that OER sometimes outpaces the licensed content,\u201d\nsaid Katie Garrett, manager of digital media services for the Utah Education\nNetwork. She added that of the 10 most popular resources on the website right\nnow, eight are OER.\n\nWhen Utah began looking for a new repository \u2014 a move prompted by Pearson\u2019s\ndecision to shut down EQUELLA \u2014 it evaluated a number of different options in\nthe market. These included the two biggest names \u2014 OER Commons and Amazon\nInspire \u2014 but others as well, like Kaltura MediaSpace and Canvas Commons.\n\n\u201cAmazon Inspire is one we gave a good look at,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was super\nexcited about it. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always heard from educators: \u2018I want\nto search for resources the way I shop on Amazon.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, she said, Utah wanted to have its own branded interface, and Amazon\nInspire was not offering that option. Garrett said she also hesitated at the\nthought of requiring teachers in Utah to create Amazon accounts \u2014 a necessity\nfor Inspire users. That \u201cdidn\u2019t seem like something our teachers would warm up\nto,\u201d she said, adding that it seemed politically precarious.\n\nUltimately, the ability to have both privately and openly licensed content,\nplus the branded interface, is what sold Utah on OER Commons, though the state\ndid at one point upload [over a\ndozen](https://www.amazoninspire.com/search?query=Utah%20State%20Board%20of%20Education#resource_owner_id=4002&resource_owner_type=ORGANIZATION)\ndigital resources to Inspire, which remain on the site today.\n\nWashington state\u2019s OER initiative was born out of\n[legislation](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28A.300.803) passed\nin 2012, which directed the Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public\nInstruction (OSPI) \u2014 the state\u2019s education department \u2014 to develop a library\nof openly licensed courseware and to raise awareness about the availability of\nOER.\n\nUnlike what Indiana is doing with the Rockstars of Curation, the Washington\nOSPI has focused more of its time and resources on creating new OER than\ncurating existing ones. And the state is putting money behind the effort.\n\n\u201cHonestly, other states are doing that [vetting], and they\u2019re doing it well,\u201d\nsaid [Barbara Soots](http://edscoop.com/edtech-hero-barbara-soots-washington),\nthe OER program manager for the OSPI. Instead, Soots and the OSPI have\ninvested in local Washington districts interested in authoring or adapting\ntheir own openly licensed materials.\n\nThey do this through a competitive grant program. Districts can apply for\nfunding, and those that are selected are\n[required](http://surveygizmolibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/library/68766/OSPICopyrightandOpenLicensingPolicy2016.pdf)\nto openly license any educational resources that result from the grant.\n\nDepartment officials knew those grants would result in high-quality OER that\nneeded a place to live \u2014 one where other districts in Washington could search\nfor, find and benefit from the materials.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a place we could share with other districts the good work they\u2019re\ndoing,\u201d Soots said, so they found a solution that fit their needs. Washington\nuses OER Commons, but not in the same way Michigan and Utah do.\n\nInstead of a microsite, Washington \u2014 as well as Pennsylvania, North Dakota and\nothers \u2014 has something called a [hub](https://www.oercommons.org/about-hubs).\nAn OER Commons hub is automatically shared with the general public \u2014 anyone\nwho has access to the internet can use the resources living on a state\u2019s hub.\nThe [Washington hub](https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/washington) hosts the\ndistrict grantees\u2019 OER and any instructional materials created by the state.\n\nThe Washington OSPI has spent a lot of time and programming on professional\ndevelopment around OER \u2014 how to provide proper attribution, what an open\nlicense is, and so on. \u201cWe give this information upfront, so our grantees can\ndevelop their materials with the end-game of openness in mind,\u201d Soots said.\n\nThough Washington\u2019s hub in OER Commons was created several years ago, it\nhadn\u2019t gotten much attention or promotion until recently, Soots said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only now that we have districts adapting and developing materials that\nwe\u2019re starting to use this to its full potential,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really\nstarting to advertise it now that we\u2019re getting more and more resources up.\u201d\n\nBased on the districts awarded grants this year, some of those resources will\nsoon include a history project focused on local Native American tribes and a\nconceptual chemistry course for high schoolers.\n\nTo date, Washington has invested $1.25 million in its OER initiative. But five\ngrant districts alone can account for over $1 million in cost savings,\nindicating that the OSPI\u2019s investment will soon pay itself off. And based on\n23 OER projects carried out since 2013, the state estimates that almost 2,000\nteachers and 70,000 students have directly interacted with OER.\n\nLooking beyond Washington, Soots said that the biggest value added by inter-\nstate collaboration is in addressing issues like accessibility and licensing;\nit\u2019s less important which repository is hosting the OER, she said, because at\nthe end of the day every state faces those same challenges.\n\n\u201cIn the bigger picture I\u2019m not sure it matters all that much what platform is\nbeing used,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s also contributing to the momentum of OER is the extent to which states\nare working together.\n\nMichigan, Utah and Wisconsin \u2014 the three states developing microsites on OER\nCommons \u2014 have formed an advisory board to examine how they can share\nresources across the three states.\n\n\u201cWe certainly would like to share specific collections if we know, for\nexample, that those content standards are the same as Michigan\u2019s and if\nWisconsin\u2019s resources, for example, are high-quality,\u201d Mapes said.\n\nBy opening up communication between Michigan, Utah and Wisconsin, all 50\nstates stand to benefit, said Mindy Boland, senior director of OER services at\nISKME.\n\n\u201cThe advisory board is very exciting for us,\u201d Boland said. \u201cThese states all\nhave similar problems they want to solve, so it\u2019s a great way for us to make\nthat conversation more normalized.\u201d\n\nThey and the 17 other #GoOpen states also join a monthly call organized by the\nCCSSO and SETDA, in conjunction with the U.S. Education Department. \u201cThose\nthree organizations have provided a lot of guidance and assistance as we move\nthrough this process,\u201d Mapes said.\n\nOn the calls, which are led by Mooney from the CCSSO, the states take turns\npresenting on where they are in their OER work or discussing their different\nexperiences around a specific issue, such as accessibility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure this community is collaborating,\" Mooney said,\n\"that it isn\u2019t siloed and that states are coming together as much as they\ncan.\u201d\n\n###  -In this Story-\n\n[Amazon Education](https://edscoop.com/tag/amazon-education/), [Amazon\nInspire](https://edscoop.com/tag/amazon-inspire/),
