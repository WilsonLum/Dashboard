Secures $1.25M In Seed Funding To Modernize Office Management\n\n[ Frederic Lardinois ](https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/)\n[@fredericl](https://twitter.com/fredericl) /  6 years\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/01/pingboard_squares.jpg?w=730)\n\nOffice management isn't exactly an area most startups tackle, but\n[Pingboard](http://pingboard.com/), which is launching in beta today, aims to\nbecome \"an office manager's best friend.\" The company argues that it's the\nfirst really modern service that was built for office managers. Pingboard also\nannounced today that it has raised a $1.25 million funding round.\n\nWhile enterprises have often developed their own solutions, Pingboard says, it\nwants to become the go-to office management solution for small and medium\nbusinesses and startups. The company says these still tend to rely on seldom-\nupdated spreadsheets (we've got a few of those at TechCrunch as well) and\nmanual processes. Pingboard, on the other hand, stores all employee\ninformation in a single place.\n\nThe service also offers an API, so companies that need to connect their\ndirectory to more complex applications and have the resources to do so can\nexpand the service to meet their own needs.\n\n![profile \\(1\\)](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/01/profile-1.png)\n\nIndeed, while the company is starting out with this directory service, it does\nsee itself as a platform. It's starting out small because it believes that\nhaving the core directory data allows it to then power more interesting use\ncases. The team says this could be anything from powering company lunch orders\nto getting into human capital management. Over the long run, that's where the\nPingboard team believes the real value of its service will be.\n\n\"We are launching focused on the employee directory first because virtually\neverything that needs to be automated in an office centers around employee\ninformation,\" the company told me.\n\nAs part of the core service, Pingboard includes some basic messaging\nfunctionality (using email or text messages) so employees can easily notify\neach other or receive notifications from their office manager when they have a\nvisitor or a package has arrived for them, for example. All of the data in the\nsystem can be imported from spreadsheets and auto-synced with Google Apps,\nsocial profiles and HR systems. The service also allows users to sign in with\nthe Google Apps accounts.\n\nThe service was founded by Bill Boebel (CEO) and Rob Eanes (CTO). Boebel is an\nAustin-based angel investor and part of [Capital\nFactory](http://capitalfactory.com/), together with OtherInbox founder Joshua\nBaer and WP Engine founder Jason Cohen. He previously built Webmail.us, which\nwas acquired by Rackspace in 2007. He stayed with Rackspace until 2011. The\nproject was incubated at [Capital Thought](http://about.me/capitalthought), an\nincubator founded by Boebel, Baer and Cohen.\n\nThe lead investor in Pingboard's funding round is Silverton Partners. Baer and\nCohen also invested in this round, as did Webmail.us founder Pat Matthews,\nRackspace funder Pat Condon, Indeed.com founder Rony Kahan and RightScale\nfounder Jonathan Siegel.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "San Antonio's Active Capital Invests $1 Million In Pingboard -

The deal was signed in mid May.\n\n[](https://cpa.ds.npr.org/kstx/audio/2018/06/pingbordinvestment.mp3 \"As heard\non Texas Public Radio on June 1\")\n\nListen\n\nListening...\n\n/\n\n0:59\n\nAs heard on Texas Public Radio on June 1\n\n  \n\nAustin-based Pingboard was founded in 2014. Its software develops customizable\norganizational charts for companies. Company officials said it began focused\non software that developed company directories, but quickly found that\ncustomizable org charts \u2014 accessible on the web and on mobile devices \u2014 was\ntheir most requested application.\n\n\u201cIt basically lets companies easily build an org chart which every company in\nthe world has to do,\u201d Pingboard co-founder Bill Boebel said.\n\nThe company has more than 1,000 paying clients, while its free version has\nmore than twice that number. According to Boebel, they are building a tool to\nattract tens of thousands of customers.\n\n\u201cI would have never guessed that there would be this much demand or this much\nneed in the market for org charts when we got started,\u201d he said.\n\nThis round of funding will allow Pingboard to focus on using the product to\nplan a company\u2019s expansion. That\u2019s something that Boebel is having to deal\nwith right now at Pingboard, as they plan to double their staff in the next\nyear.\n\n\u201cWe run into the same thing that some of our customers have been asking for,\u201d\nBoebel said. \u201cWe have even more of a compelling reason to build it out.\u201d\n\nThe investment reunites Active Capital general partner Pat Matthews and\nBoebel. The two founded the company Webmail.us, an email company that earned\nnearly $10 million in revenue before being sold to Rackspace in 2007.\n\nMatthews says the history he shares with Pingboard is one reason Active\nCapital made the million dollar investment, describing their normal investment\namount of between $100,000 to $500,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very close to Pingboard since the beginning. Personally, I was an\nangel investor very early. Bill and I are good friends, so we\u2019ve always stayed\nin touch. So, I was very close to the evolution of it all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal marks Active Capital\u2019s tenth since last August, which may surprise\npeople since the fund hasn\u2019t done an organized media push. Matthews said\nActive Capital was more focused on making good investments and working with\nfounders than promoting itself.\n\n\u201cComing out of stealth mode has not been the highest priority,\u201d Matthews said.\n\u201cDoing 10 deals in six or seven months keeps a small team busy.\u201d\n\nActive Capital invests in business-facing software as a service companies that\nmake money, and are still run by their founders.\n\nFor Matthews, founding Active Capital has been a return to what he enjoys:\nworking with passionate company founders to grow businesses.\n\nThe deal also reunites Boebel with Rackspace co-founder Pat Condon, who is now\nan Active Capital partner.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to things that companies face as they grow, he\u2019s got a lot of\nexperience,\u201d Boebel said.\n\nIn a filing with the [Securities Exchange\nCommission](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1596160/000159616018000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml),\nthe $2.5 million appears as $5 million due to convertible notes from a\nprevious round. Boebel wrote a piece for VentureBeat explaining the difference\nand pushing for a new way to fund SaaS companies.\n\n[The post](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/31/a-better-way-to-fund-saas-\ncompanies/) also explains why Pingboard decided to go with an additional seed\nround rather than a Series A, which would require giving away more equity to\nventure firms. He wrote that a seed round allows the company to focus on a\nsmooth manageable growth trajectory, rather than growing as fast as possible\nto satisfy investors, burning through cash and having to raise another round.\n\n_**Paul Flahive can be reached at[paul@tpr.org](mailto:paul@tpr.org) or follow\nhim on Twitter [@paulflahive](https://twitter.com/paulflahive?lang=en)**_\n\nTags:\n\n[Technology & Entrepreneurship](/term/technology-entrepreneurship-0)\n\n[venture capitalism](/term/venture-capitalism)\n\n[Geekdom](/term/geekdom)\n\n[Rackspace](/term/rackspace)\n\n[Share](http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy5ytx9d8&t=San%20Antonio%27s%20Active%20Capital%20Invests%20%241%20Million%20In%20Pingboard\n\"Share\")[Tweet](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy5ytx9d8&text=San%20Antonio%27s%20Active%20Capital%20Invests%20%241%20Million%20In%20Pingboard\n\"Tweet\")[Email](mailto:?subject=San%20Antonio%27s%20Active%20Capital%20Invests%20%241%20Million%20In%20Pingboard&body=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinyurl.com%2Fy5ytx9d8\n\"Email\")\n\n[View the discussion thread.](http://npr-\nkstx.disqus.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpr.org%2Fpost%2Fsan-antonios-active-\ncapital-invests-1-million-pingboard)\n\n### Related Content\n\n[](/post/geekdom-says-its-ahead-curve-creating-tech-sector-san-antonio)\n\n## [Geekdom Says It's Ahead Of Curve In Creating Tech Sector For San\nAntonio](/post/geekdom-says-its-ahead-curve-creating-tech-sector-san-antonio)\n\nBy [Paul Flahive ](/people/paul-flahive) _\u2022_ Dec 12, 2016\n\n[\n![](https://www.tpr.org/sites/kstx/files/styles/medium/public/201612/geekdom.JPG)\n](/post/geekdom-says-its-ahead-curve-creating-tech-sector-san-antonio)\n\nA new report shows a growing San Antonio technology sector.

According to Gartner,\nsenior leaders at [83% of organizations regularly communicate the importance\nof culture](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-culture-change/)\nto their workforce.\n\nAmong the key ways to ensure that employees accept the company culture and\nadhere to it is the use of employee surveys.\n\nMonthly surveys, or even [pulse\nsurveys](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/pulse-\nsurveys-vs-annual-surveys-which-is-a-better-measure-of-employee-engagement/),\nask employees to answer a few questions that check for the impact of company\npolicies on employees, employees\u2019 responses to proactive cultural change, and\nideas that they would like to share, among other things.\n\nHowever, this places the burden of implementation entirely on you, the HR\npractitioner.\n\nYou are tasked with formulating surveys, sending them, collecting responses,\nturning them into insights, and formulating policies that reshape company\nculture according to employee needs.\n\nOr, you have to sit down with individual workers to understand gaps in the\nknowledge about the established culture.\n\nAll of this leaves room for error and a risk that specific employee\nrequirements could be overlooked.\n\nA smarter alternative that is rapidly gaining popularity is culture\ntechnology, popularly known as CultureTech.\n\nLearn More: [5 Culture Metrics You Should Be Tracking in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/5-culture-\nmetrics-you-should-be-tracking-in-2019/)\n\n## **What is CultureTech and Why Is It So Important?**\n\nCulture technology or CultureTech is a compilation of one-stop solutions that\ncombine the many facets of company culture \u2013 for example, engagement,\nperformance, recognition, and communication \u2013 on a single interface.\n\nIt offers you a chance to view a variety of data in a comprehensive snapshot,\nallowing you to address multiple action points without leaving the interface.\n\nCultureTech is especially useful because:\n\n  * It minimizes the time and effort spent on creating and collecting employee surveys. \n  * Employees can break through departmental or team-wise barriers and facilitate a sense of unity. \n  * Sensitive questions can be discussed digitally, without compromising on privacy.\n  * You can control investments in company culture initiatives with an end-to-end audit trail. \n\n  \nThis is why organizations are slowly moving away from employee surveys to\nbring about organizational change.\n\nIn 2015, [89% of organizations still used formal surveys\n](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-it-time-to-toss-out-your-old-\nemployee-engagement-survey/)to gather engagement data \u2013 by the end of 2019,\nthis number is expected to dip to 74%.\n\nSo, if data collected from surveys is no longer the driver for cultural\nchange, what is?\n\nTechnology is increasingly playing a role, with IT and HR working together to\nbuild a positive and future-ready company culture. As a result, there are\nseveral exciting innovations in CultureTech that promise to replace employee\nsurveys in the next few years.\n\nLearn more: [5 Ways Technology Can Help Build a Strong Company\nCulture](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/5-ways-technology-\ncan-help-build-a-strong-company-culture/)\n\n## **5 CultureTech Solutions That Help You Establish a Solid Company Culture**\n\nEach company\u2019s culture needs are unique, based on its values, employee\nmanagement models, team size, and nature of work.\n\nHowever, certain elements should always be part of the mix: a focus on\n[collaboration](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/why-\ncollaborative-tech-is-key-to-succeeding-with-remote-teams/), creating a safe\nspace for employees, delivering engaging experiences, and aligning culture to\nyour company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nHere are five CultureTech solutions that can help you achieve this:\n\n### **1\\. Stay connected with teams and maintain visibility using Pingboard**\n\n  \n[**Pingboard**](https://pingboard.com/company-culture-software) is based on\nthe principle that cross-functional and non-linear visibility is essential to\ncompany culture.\n\nThe platform lets users view the entire organizational structure and connect\nwith anyone, regardless of designation or role. You can even assign tags such\nas interests and skillsets to help employees get to know each other \u2013 and test\nfor familiarity using flashcards.\n\nWhile Pingboard is primarily an organizational chart solution, it can go a\nlong way in improving culture, especially for small to mid-sized companies.\nNew hires are onboarded automatically and there's also a Slack integration for\nmulti-channel connectivity.\n\n### **2\\. Leverage sentiment analytics for culture development using\nPerception**\n\n  \n**[Perception](https://www.ultimateperception.com/employee-engagement-survey-\nsoftware')** is a CultureTech offering by HR technology giant Ultimate\nSoftware.\n\nInterestingly, the solution is built on a feedback and survey module \u2013 but it\ngoes one step further by applying sentiment analytics.\n\nIt can process a wide variety of inputs, including unstructured data and open-\nended texts, making it ideal for larger workforces.\n\nPerception deploys Ultimate's proprietary AI, Xander, to analyze feedback and\nidentify emotional response to culture change.\n\n### **3\\. Simplify team management using Charlie**\n\n  \n**[Charlie](https://www.charliehr.com/)** helps you create a \u201cgreat place to\nwork\u201d by removing bottlenecks in team management.\n\nThis CultureTech solution covers the entire gamut of HR tasks \u2013 from\nonboarding and leave management to benefits and recognition. You can choose\nfrom 30,000 brands when choosing benefits and there is also a dedicated\nfeedback module.\n\nBecause culture is the cumulative result of various interactions in the\nworkplace, Charlie integrates these on one platform for easy management.\n\nThe solution is competitively priced and comes in flexible packages, meant for\nvery small to mid-sized teams.\n\n### **4\\. Prioritize culture as a business goal using CultureIQ**\n\n  \nIf you\u2019re looking for detailed culture metrics and data insights,\n[**CultureIQ**](https://cultureiq.com/how-we-do-it/') could be the right\nsolution for you.\n\nThe software lets you deep dive into individual employee strengths, offers\nsentiment analytics on annual survey results, and provides a communication\nplatform for various topics. In other words, it recreates the different\ncomponents of culture in a digital format.\n\nCultureIQ ensures your culture lines up with your business objectives.\nFurther, its feature-rich offerings make it suitable for large enterprises.\n\n### **5\\. Give your team the space to open up with Rungway**\n\n  \nA lot of employee issues go unnoticed because employees are cautious about\nbringing them up with upper management.\n\nA solution like [**Rungway**](https://www.rungway.com/company-culture-\nplatform) helps in this area, offering an anonymous platform where employees\ncan ask questions they wouldn\u2019t otherwise and share their grievances.\n\nA CultureTech solution such as this can go a long way in establishing a\nculture of openness and security, helping you build an engaged team of\nemployees.\n\nLearn more: [Corporate Culture: Are You Getting it\nRight?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/corporate-\nculture-are-you-getting-it-right/)\n\n## **Pinpoint Your Needs Before Adopting**\n\nCultureTech is poised to become a booming market in the next couple of years.\n\nIt is essential that you carefully assess your requirements and targets before\nyou choose a solution for your organization.\n\n  * What is the culture established in your company mission and vision statement?\n  * What kind of culture do you aim to establish through the organization?\n  * Do you want to make some culture changes across the organization?\n\n  \nAnswering these questions can help you drive the change you want to by\nadopting culture technology.\n\nWhile surveys and feedback forms are the foundation of engagement and culture,\nthey are now only a cog in the larger wheel.\n\nAided by sentiment analytics and easy-to-use visualizations, using\nCultureTech, you can convert the raw data from surveys into positive culture-\nfocused insights \u2013 all at one place and all at once.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already doing it, it\u2019s time to leverage these solutions to\nstreamline your company culture and make it a driver of organizational growth.\n\n_Are you exploring the use of CultureTech in your organization?_ _Tell us\nabout your experience on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

In fact, [nearly half of all\nCEOs](https://hbr.org/2010/06/the-decision-driven-organization) launch a\ncompany reorganization during their first two years on the job.\n\nSo, whether this is your first or your twentieth time designing an\norganizational structure, you will do well to keep these tried-and-true\nrecommendations in mind:\n\n## 1\\. Make a \"task list\" (literally).\n\nYour natural inclination might be to first think of people, but the truth of\nthe matter is, people are around to perform specific jobs. This is why it's\nimportant to first consider the actual work that needs to be done in your\norganization. Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen developed\na theory called [\"Jobs to Be Done,\"](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-\ncustomers-jobs-to-be-done) a method for determining customer needs by\nanalyzing and identifying the \"jobs\" that warrant hired solutions. Adopting\nthis type of methodology can help you determine your company's needs in\naddition to your customers' needs.\n\nAs part of [Microsoft's reorganization in\n2013,](https://news.microsoft.com/2013/07/11/transforming-our-company/) the\ntechnology company departed from its traditional product line-focused\nstructure to become an organization centered around functions. Before making\nthis shift, Microsoft had to identify the jobs employees performed and define\ntheir areas of responsibility. With this foundational understanding, the\ncompany was then able to organize its employees into departments such as\nmarketing, engineering, and business development and evangelism.\n\n## 2\\. Plan with people in mind.\n\nBefore you get any further down the road, you'll need to pull out one of your\nmost useful tools: your organizational chart. Hopefully, it's up-to-date. One\nof McKinsey & Company's nine golden rules of organizational redesign is to be\n[rigorous about drafting in talent](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/organization/our-insights/getting-organizational-redesign-right).\nTake a look at the individuals you currently have in your organization. Look\npast their job titles and focus on their various roles and capabilities.\n\n **Related:[ 6 Steps for Creating a Strong Company\nCulture](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244309)**\n\nOf the tasks you identified in step one, how many can be fulfilled with the\ntalent you already have on hand? Using a cross-functional mindset, consider\nwhat roles can be staffed by moving employees around or splitting\nresponsibility between projects. Then look at how many require bringing on\nadditional people.\n\n## 3\\. Identify different types of managers in your organization.\n\nA Gallup study revealed that one of the most significant decisions a company\nmakes is whom it appoints as manager. The same study showed that organizations\nsurveyed failed to hire the right candidate for the job 82 percent of the\ntime. As you're giving thought to your organization's leaders, identify those\nwho are \"people\" managers and those who are \"work\" managers. People managers\nare excellent at leading a team, while work managers are those more skilled at\noverseeing tasks.\n\nDuring this evaluation process, you might find that you have managers who are\ndiamonds in the rough and just need a bit of development to reach their\npotential. When multinational banking company HSBC rolled out its[\n](http://chrome-\nextension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html)matrix structure\nin 2011, the company trained its managers on how to motivate a culture of\ncollaboration and communicate with transparency.\n\nAs you think through the tasks that need completing and the individual talent\nyou have in house, identify effective managers and potential managers and\ndetermine which parts of the company will benefit most from their respective\nleadership.\n\n## 4\\. Be purposeful in assigning job titles.\n\nMany startups in the process of \"scaling\" make the often-irreversible mistake\nof assigning \"chief\" and \"vice president\" titles too early. By all means, if\nthe job responsibilities and qualifications warrant such titles, go for it.\nBut, remember: If you give someone a high-ranking title from day one, you will\nfind it difficult to hire above him or her as the company grows and requires\nmore senior leadership.\n\nIt's also important to assign titles appropriately in order to allow for\nproper career paths and growth opportunities within the organization. Michelle\nZatlyn, co-founder of SaaS platform Cloudflare, [held off for\nyears](https://qz.com/work/1195640/job-titles-are-making-everyone-worse-at-\ntheir-jobs/) before taking on the title of COO. Remaining title-less allowed\nZatlyn and her co-founder Matthew Prince more flexibility when they were\nbuilding their organization and left them unbound from any need to create a\nmultitude of VP and SVP titles.\n\n## 5\\. Consider spans of control.\n\nAnother factor to carefully consider is the optimal[ \"span of\ncontrol\"](https://hbr.org/2012/04/how-many-direct-reports?cm_sp=Article-_-\nLinks-_-Comment) \\-- that is, the number of direct reports -- for each of your\npeople managers. New organizational structures and technology enable managers\nto effectively lead a larger number of people than in the past, but companies\nmust be cautious not to overload managers with an impractical number of direct\nreports.\n\nAccording to researchers at Booz & Company and the Harvard Business School,\nthe span of control of CEOs has doubled over the past two decades. Add to that\nthe increased complexity of today's businesses and you have a recipe for an\nincrease in administrative tasks and meetings and a decline in productivity\namong your leaders.\n\nAs you structure your own organization, carefully evaluate the work and your\nemployees -- from their particular management styles and job titles to their\nindividual spans of control. One of the most useful tools throughout the\nentire process is a visual depiction of your company in a dynamic organization\nchart, which allows you to pay careful attention to both work tasks and human\nfactors alike.\n\n **Related:[Creating a Culture of Innovation Starts With the\nLeader](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/280870)**\n\nBusiness owners structure their organizations in various ways for a multitude\nof reasons, but the end goal should always be to carry out the process as\neffectively and painlessly as possible, in a way that bolsters your business\nand energizes your employees.\n\n##  More from Entrepreneur\n\n[ ![Sign up now to Entrepreneur Press: Book of the\nWeek](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20191004063004-EP-BOTW-Promo-\nImage-2000x1334.jpg?format=jpg&width=700&crop=16:9)\n](https://www.entrepreneur.com/subscribe/botw)\n\nGet heaping discounts to books you love delivered straight to your inbox.\nWe\u2019ll feature a different book each week and share exclusive deals you won\u2019t\nfind anywhere else.\n\n[ Sign Up Now ](https://www.entrepreneur.com/subscribe/botw)\n\n[ ![Jumpstart Your Business with Entrepreneur\nInsider](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190601122201-Insider-Bottom-\nArticle-Promo-v4a.jpg?format=jpg&width=700&crop=16:9)\n](https://www.entrepreneur.com/insider/learn-more)\n\nJumpstart Your Business.

We now\nhave more than 1,000 customers globally, including companies like GoFundMe,\nPopsugar, Udemy, Sequoia Capital, WPEngine, and the Linux Foundation. You\nprobably hear about startups raising this type of funding all the time in the\ntech press, but under the surface, these rounds are not always what they seem.\n\nFor example, our latest raise was $2.5 million, not $5 million. It appears in\nour SEC filing as $5 million because we had $2.5 million in convertible notes\nfrom our prior round that converted into equity alongside the new $2.5 million\nround.\n\nThis was actually our third $2.5 million round.\n\n  * In 2014 we raised $2.5 million from friends and family, led by Silverton, to get started (our \u201cSeed\u201d)\n\n  * In 2016 we raised $2.5 million from a broader set of angels once we had found our niche (our \u201cSeed 1\u201d)\n\n  * And now we\u2019ve raised a $2.5 million round to grow a little faster (our \u201cSeed 2\u201d)\n\nThis is important for other SaaS company founders and VCs to understand, since\na $2.5 million raise is a very different kind of round from a $5 million\nraise.\n\n## How SaaS companies should be funded **  \n**\n\nAs a repeat founder and occasionally an angel investor, I\u2019ve realized that\n\u201cseed\u201d is no longer a round of funding, but rather a phase that startups go\nthrough.\n\n[![VB TRansform 2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15\n- 16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)![VB TRansform\n2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15 -\n16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)](https://www.vbtransform.com/)\n\nOur investor, [Active Capital](https://www.activecapital.com/) is a new fund\nbased in Texas, led by Pat Matthews and Pat Condon. Pat Matthews and I founded\nWebmail.us together back in 1999 in Blacksburg, Virginia and sold it to\nRackspace in 2007. Pat Condon founded Rackspace and was our colleague there\nfor almost 7 years.\n\nOur latest round also represents a sort of soft-launch of Pat and Pat\u2019s new\nfund, which is designed specifically to support smaller iterative rounds. Of\ncourse I know Pat and Pat super well, but we chose them from amongst several\nbigger names because they understand and agree wholeheartedly with the funding\nstrategy I\u2019m about to lay out below.\n\nIt is my hope that with this post I can start a dialogue around how to fund\nearly-stage SaaS companies and reorient both VCs and entrepreneurs to this\nreality. Once you start thinking of Seed as a phase instead of a round,\neveryone benefits.\n\nAs Hunter Walk at Homebrew points out in a [great post about\nthis](https://hunterwalk.com/2018/02/20/for-fundraising-seed-is-no-longer-a-\nround-its-a-phase/), companies in mature markets like SaaS must, during their\nseed phase, \u201cbuild not just product-market fit, but a real company.\u201d\n\nSaaS companies in the seed phase are building a flywheel, not a rocketship.\nRocketships stow an incredible amount of fuel onboard and burn it as quickly\nas possible in order to escape gravitational forces. Flywheels use human\neffort and gravity to their advantage, storing energy for later use.\n\nRocketships are incredibly exciting to watch but incredibly inefficient.\nFlywheels are all about mechanical prowess and smoothing inputs and outputs\nfor optimal efficiency.\n\nEarlier this year I considered raising a traditional Silicon Valley-style\nseries A. I met with partners at about two dozen top tier VCs to pitch them on\nPingboard.\n\nIt was clear right away that Silicon Valley VCs all are looking to invest in\nrocketships. A rocketship will either get you to the moon or crash, and that\nis exactly what many traditional investors want to put their money behind. The\nPower Law of venture capital mandates that investors categorize you as either\na 1 or a 0 as quickly as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, this approach is not ideal for companies like mine. SaaS\ncompanies\u2019 capital requirements and trajectory require a different approach.\nWe may become rocketships, but our gestation cycle is longer and has more\nsubtle contours.\n\nThe upside of course, is that our capital requirements are lower because we\nmust focus on revenue from day one. But recurring revenue \u2014 and as such, bills\nthat a company will pay long before any other payable or lien \u2014 isn\u2019t built\novernight. MRR and ARR require elbow grease and constant iteration over a time\nperiod longer than the runway a typical VC round funds.\n\nTo continue with the flywheel metaphor, you can make a flywheel spin faster\nand faster the harder you push on it, and while it may slow down temporarily\nwhen things don\u2019t go as planned, it won\u2019t crash \u2014 flywheels keep spinning. I\nlike to use that analogy when I describe how we run our company. It\u2019s all\nabout building up a head of steam.\n\nSaaS companies like ours do not require large amounts of capital all at one\ntime in order to fund expensive upfront R&D and brand marketing or to hire\ngiant sales teams. Instead, we require small amounts of capital over an\nextended period of time in order to experiment and continuously push harder\nand harder on the things that work.\n\nThis is why most SaaS companies today ought to raise several smaller rounds of\nfunding during the seed phase before going out to raise a series A. This is\nalmost always the right thing to do.\n\nAs such, the best funding source for a SaaS company is closer to an IV drip\nthan it is to a shot of adrenaline to the heart. We need more funding sources\nthat understand this reality and are as iterative with their checks as their\nportfolio companies are with their product, sales and marketing.\n\n\u201cBut Bill,\u201d you might say, \u201cit sucks to raise funding in tranches. I\u2019d rather\nraise it all in one fell swoop and get back to doing what I do best: building\nmy business.\u201d\n\nI completely understand that objection, but here\u2019s my retort:\n\nRaising a big round like you are imagining actually takes more time and energy\nthan what I\u2019m proposing, not less. And worse, you end up pricing the round or\nputting a cap on the note based on a leap of faith, or an emotional high,\nwhich introduces the risk of down-rounds later. Terms are set the way they are\nset because of power dynamics, not business merit.\n\nToo often we look at raising one, two, or three seed rounds as a sign that a\ncompany couldn\u2019t raise a Series A. We need to start looking at the Series A as\nthe construct it is, calibrated to how we used to build software a decade ago.\nWhat if funding was as agile as our operations? Why is venture funding still\nusing a waterfall model of development and deployment?\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not anti-Series A. What I\u2019m against is the idea that venture\nrounds are these monolithic events that happen every two years or so.\n\nYes, raising money in the way I\u2019m describing makes the entrepreneur more\naccountable, but that\u2019s a good thing. You should be valued according to what\nyou have done as well as what you are going to do. This new, more agile way\nmakes VCs more accountable, too. The whole system grows more taut.\n\n## The touch zero operating model\n\nThere\u2019s also a personal side to choosing a funding model that we don\u2019t often\ndiscuss.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built a rocketship and you\u2019re confident you\u2019ve made all the right\ncalculations to get to the moon, grab ahold and don\u2019t let go! Still, you will\nprobably crash eventually, and traditional venture capitalists will tell you\nthat it is okay.\n\nThey will tell you that by \u201cfailing fast\u201d you will get more \u201cat bats\u201d starting\nmore companies and increasing your chances of eventually finding your\nrocketship.\n\nWhile this math is true for VCs, it has real dissonance for most\nentrepreneurs. Most entrepreneurs put their entire life into their company,\nsacrificing money, health, family, friends \u2014 and then when they fail, they\nwalk away smarter with battle scars, but they\u2019re also burnt out, broke, and\nquestioning everything. All this happens while their VC has a dozen more\ncompanies just like them in their portfolio, needing just one to reach the\nmoon.\n\nThere are other ways to build a very large company.\n\nOne way is to treat each round of funding as if it\u2019s your last and operate in\na manner where you will get to profitability before you run out of money. The\ncompanies I\u2019ve personally built have never had a \u201cfume date.\u201d A fume date is\nthe date at which the bank account goes below $0 and you either go out of\nbusiness or have to raise more money.\n\nInstead we have a \u201ctouch zero date\u201d \u2014 this is the basis of my whole operations\nstrategy, and something I\u2019ll blog a lot more about in the future.\n\nA touch zero date is the date at which we reach $0 in the bank account and at\nthat same exact moment reach profitability (meaning we don\u2019t go out of\nbusiness or need to raise more money). We are always in full control of our\nown destiny.\n\nWe use a \u201cTouch Zero Operating Plan\u201d to manage our business. At a high level,\nwe measure everything and use data to model how we plan to scale our growth\ninvestments and revenue so that we touch $0 and reach profitability at the\nsame time.\n\nWhy do we want to \u201ctouch $0\u201d? Why should it be a goal to run out of money and\nreach profitability at the same time?\n\nIf we operate on a plan that has more of a cash buffer, we\u2019d be effectively\nsitting on cash and growing slower than we otherwise could. And if we operate\non a plan that has us dipping below $0, we die. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\ntune this model weekly as we try new things and get more data.\n\nIf things go well, we may raise more money and reset the plan, pushing back\nthe touch $0 date, as we did this week. If things don\u2019t go as planned or we\ngrow slower than expected, we\u2019ll conserve cash and make sure we reach\nprofitability while we fix things.\n\nWhile fundraising, I did not feel aligned with most VCs when I told them about\nmy Touch Zero plan. In fact, most emphatically said they would not want me to\nrun the company this way if they were to invest.\n\nThey wanted me to invest more money at a faster pace and aim for certain\nmilestones that, if reached, in theory would earn us the opportunity to raise\nanother round of funding, and then we\u2019d repeat that cycle over and over again.\nThis looked to me an awful lot like a treadmill.\n\nAs an [investor myself](https://angel.co/billboebel), I\u2019ve seen too many\nstartups not reach those milestones and get themselves into a tight financial\nsituation where they have to raise cash on terrible terms in order to survive.\n\nWhen this happens, VCs end up owning way more of the company than the founders\never expected. Most VCs aren\u2019t taking unfair advantage of the situation\n(although some do), they are just doing their job. Founders have to understand\nthe risks (although most don\u2019t) if they choose to get on the VC treadmill.\n\n## Next steps\n\nI\u2019m going to keep writing about alternative ways to build a very large company\nand power it responsibly with external investment. I hope you\u2019ll help me by\nsending ideas and giving me lots of tough-love feedback. Please do.\n\nTo those reading, I encourage you to figure out what type of company you want\nto build and do it your way. You don\u2019t have to play by someone else\u2019s rules.\nEntrepreneurs get to write and rewrite the rules.

Stephen Duess,\nwho once was president and CEO of Bogota Savings Bank in Teaneck, N.J., will\nserve as president.\n\nMona Abraham and Jenya Rubinshteyn, investment bankers who have worked at\nCitigroup and JPMorgan Chase, are expected to serve on PiNG's board.

This is the third February layoff in\nthree years. The trend began shortly after the company was acquired by Apollo\nGlobal Management, a private equity firm.\n\nThe company said in a statement that like other technology companies, they are\nconstantly rebalancing their workforce.\n\n\"We take actions on an ongoing basis in some areas we are over-invested and\nhire in areas where we are under invested.\"\n\nThe company eliminated around 3 percent of their total workforce, and said\nthey have nearly 200 job vacancies currently posted.\n\nLast February, the company let go around 100 people saying they needed to shed\njobs from less productive areas of the business while they continue to hire in\nareas of bigger growth. The same rationale was given in 2017, when the newly\nacquired Rackspace let go of 6 percent of its global workforce and about 200\npeople locally.\n\nThe company declined to say how many local employees would be let go this\ntime, but sources with direct knowledge said it is around 200 people.\n\nApollo brought the company private for $4.3 billion after several rocky years\non the stock market, during which Rackspace saw its market value decline by\nmore than half. The financial website TheStreet called the company\u2019s stock\n\u201c[Truly the Worst in the\nWorld](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13446763/1/here-s-why-rackspace-is-\ntruly-the-worst-stock-in-the-world.html)\u201d in 2016 as big players Amazon Web\nServices, Google and Microsoft all entered the web hosting field.

Can The New Silicon Valley Startup be Relied Upon To Save Lives?\n\n1\n\nBy  CIOReview | Monday, October 21, 2019\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?text=Can The New Silicon Valley Startup\nbe...-One Concern, and AI platform, has been...#cioreview via\n@cioreview&url=https://www.cioreview.com/news/can-the-new-silicon-valley-\nstartup-be-relied-upon-to-save-lives-nid-30537-cid-213.html)  \n  \n---  \n  \n![](https://www.cioreview.com/newsimages/special/Qdc8aquT.jpeg)**One Concern,\nand AI platform, has been developed to predict natural disasters, is a\ntantalizing solution. However, it is new and untested. Can it be relied\nupon?**\n\n**FREMONT, CA:  **Recently, there has been an investigation on One Concern, a\nSilicon Valley startup, which is specifically designed to support cities and\ncounties in the event of natural disasters by creating [disaster response\nplans](https://disaster-recovery.cioreview.com/cioviewpoint/strategizing-the-\nbest-disaster-recovery-plans-nid-23805-cid-106.html). The company uses a\nplethora of data from various sources for predicting the ways earthquakes and\nfloods can impact the city, on a building-by-building with 85 percent\nprecision, within 15 minutes of the disaster hitting the town.\n\nHowever, many cities like San Francisco are ending their contract with One\nConcern because of their doubts regarding the precision of the company's\npredictions. The heat map style interface should show city officials the real-\ntime damage prediction post an earthquake and deliver damage levels for every\nblock, thus assisting planners in deciding how to divide resources to reach\npeople who are in need.\n\nThe design's simplicity made San Francisco's former emergency management\ndirector adopt this platform. It is more intuitive than a free service offered\nby FEMA for forecasting earthquake damage.[![Top Tech Startups Solution\nCompanies](https://cioreview.com/Rank_subcat_images/x5lvnTech_Startup-01.jpg)](https://tech-\nstartup.cioreview.com/vendors/most-promising-tech-startups.html)\n\nHowever, according to Seattle's emergency management department, there were\ngaping holes in commercial neighborhoods in One Concern's earthquake\nstimulation map. One Concern justified this by saying that the company depends\nmostly on residential census data. It was found that One Concern's future\nearthquake damage assessments were unrealistic. The building where the\nemergency management department operates was earthquake-safe. But, the\nalgorithms of the company determined that it would have severe damage. One\nConcern also displayed larger than expected numbers of structures at risk\nbecause it had calculated every apartment in a high-rise as a different\nbuilding.\n\nIn fact, many former workers shared their misgivings regarding startup claims.\nUnlike other competitors such as flood prediction startup Fathom, the\ncompany's algorithms have not been tested by independent researchers with the\nresults printed in academic journals.\n\nNow One Concern has started to join hands with **[insurance\ncompanies](http://insurtech-\neurope.insuranceciooutlook.com/cxoinsights/navigating-around-disparate-\nchallenges-in-marine-insurance-nid-727.html)** which can utilize its disaster\nforecasts to raise rates, in part as only a few towns have paid for its\nproduct so far. This move resulted in some former employees to feel\ndisillusioned with the mission of the company.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that the startup's initial success--with $55\nmillion in venture capital funding, advisors like retired general, the former\nCIA director David Petraeus as well as the team members such as former FEMA\nhead Craig Fugate -- was developed on misleading claims and sleek design.\n\nWith more devastating natural disasters coming up, cities need to contemplate\non the planning and response to emergencies.\n\nWith faulty technology, which is not even precise as the company says, One\nConcern could be putting the lives of people at stake.  \n\n**Check out:  [Top Disaster Recovery Tech

Cold prospecting\nis proactive, goes straight to the target, and initiates the dialogue needed\nfor sales.\n\nBut robocalls, phishing, scammers, and more are making uninvited contacts less\nwelcomed than ever. It\u2019s no wonder [more than\n40%](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics) of salespeople view\nprospecting as the hardest part of the sales process, and think buyers view\nthem as pushy and annoying.\n\nDespite the stigma, salespeople still use the phone, and email, a lot. Those\nwho do cold prospecting well generate [2.7\u00d7 more sales\nmeetings](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/sales-research/sales-prospecting-\nresearch) than the rest.\n\nWe need our sales hunters and we can help reduce their stress in ways that\nbenefit the whole company. With cloud technology, centralized contacts, and a\nculture of internal referrals, warming up prospects is easier and more\neffective than ever. Here\u2019s the why and how to do it.\n\n## Hidden connections for cold prospecting: where and why\n\n[Cold prospecting](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/cold-calling-statistics) is\nfinding and contacting potential customers with whom there\u2019s been no previous\ncontact. The notorious part of this is the cold calling. In fact, it doesn\u2019t\nhave to be cold. Sales intelligence and social selling can warm up prospects\nbefore the outreach stage, though nothing beats a warm introduction.\n\nThat\u2019s fine if you know someone to introduce you. But what if you don\u2019t? Easy.\n\nIf anyone is [six degrees of separation](https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/the-\nhistory-of-the-six-degrees-of-separation-study.html) from anyone else, then in\nthe workplace we\u2019re often down to one or two degrees. An average LinkedIn user\nhas [400 connections](https://techjury.net/stats-about/linkedin/#gref),\naccording to one study. That means anyone in the company is just one person\naway from anyone else\u2019s 400 connections, and that\u2019s just on LinkedIn.\n\nIf sales reps can find these links before the outreach, they can seek an\n\u201cinternal referral\u201d and get that warm introduction.\n\nBack-office staff also have contact with prospects, just not in a sales\ncapacity. These are all valuable human relations that establish social capital\nand can open other doors. The challenge is to find out who in the company has\na connection with the prospect.\n\nBy visualizing networks through centralized contacts, the unlikeliest of\nconnections can easily lead to internal referrals bridging to pre-qualified\nprospects.\n\n![centralized contacts chart](https://learn.g2.com/hs-\nfs/hubfs/G2%20Content%20Brief%20-%20Sansan-1.png?width=600&name=G2%20Content%20Brief%20-%20Sansan-1.png)\n\n  \nWhile cooperative work culture has gained plenty of attention, little is\nwritten on centralized contacts and on contact sharing. The practice is common\nin teamwork-driven culture, such as in Japanese companies, but it\u2019s still\nsomething of a hidden secret elsewhere. The following steps will get you\nthere.\n\n## Step 1: Use cloud-based technology to centralize contact data\n\nTo share contacts and internal referrals, there must be a centralized\nrepository of customer data. Making it cloud-based adds a level of security\nand makes it accessible anywhere. But where are your company\u2019s contacts?\nUsually they\u2019re in desks, LinkedIn accounts, phones, even Rolodexes. They\u2019re\nall private places, so you can\u2019t go there.\n\nWhere you can go is the CRM or the contact management system (CMS). Both,\nideally, are company-wide (central) and cloud-based (secure and distance-\nagnostic).\n\n### Make the CRM or CMS your prospecting flight deck\n\nCRMs are nearly ubiquitous: [91% of businesses with 11+ employees use a\nCRM](https://econsultancy.com/five-reasons-your-crm-isn-t-actually-increasing-\nsales/). So you probably have one. The Salesforce dashboard and HubSpot are\nprospecting sources in waiting. The CRM introduction process is also a chance\nto empower people and show commitment to transparency.\n\nEnlist the end users to help choose a CRM that they actually want. If you like\nyour current CRM, keep it, expand its use, and [audit it](/end-of-year-crm-\naudit?_ga=2.187117352.1244365219.1580154493-2001258096.1580154493) at least\nannually. CRMs do, however, lack non-lead connections, and that's where we can\nhelp them.\n\nTIP: Find the right [CRM solution\n](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm#easiest_to_use)for your needs today.\n\n[![View the Easiest-to-Use CRM Software \u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/f7b8bc2f-b0ff-49b2-9955-1535ed1f32bd.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/f7b8bc2f-b0ff-49b2-9955-1535ed1f32bd)\n\n### Integrate or separately use a CMS and sharing system\n\nLeads and customers comprise most contacts in a CRM. Those all represent\nfuture prospects if the deals don\u2019t work out, but what\u2019s lacking are:\n\n  * Non-lead business encounters (networking events, meetings, etc.)\n  * Recruits and interviewees\n  * Social encounters (parties, volunteering, gym, etc.)\n  * Random encounters (airport, supermarket, etc.)\n\nEach human encounter has the potential for collaboration and new ventures. If\nnot for the owner, then for someone else. These contacts are more likely to be\nheld on a personal PC or device, in physical form, or in a CMS if you\u2019re\nlucky. A good CMS is invaluable here, and distinct from the CRM.\n\nA [comprehensive CMS that is designed for all\ncontacts](https://www.g2.com/products/sansan/reviews?_ga=2.173433763.1244365219.1580154493-2001258096.1580154493)\nlets you digitize (by scanning) accurate contacts, visualize connections,\neliminate duplicate accounts and data, and it can enrich and update your CRM\ndata when integrated. Or used on its own if it has CRM functions for tracking\nleads and accounts. This solution gives the company centralized, cloud-based,\nup-to-date contact data of all types of business contact.\n\n## Step 2: Constantly feed the CRM/CMS with contacts\n\nA CRM is only as good as its data, and the data\u2019s only as good as how it\u2019s\nused. You\u2019ll need a system for supplying the CRM, or CMS, with new contacts,\nday in and day out. And it has to be automated and easy because salespeople\nspend [17% of their time on tedious data\nentry](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-salespeople-learn) when they could\nbe selling.\n\n### Identify and round up the contacts and get them in the system\n\nLeads and contacts come from [many places and in many\nforms](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/where-do-marketers-get-leads-data),\nincluding social media, direct mail, trade shows, and even casual encounters.\nThey can be in digital format or on paper, and they can contain as little as\nan email address.\n\nBusiness cards may be the most useful format for all of these, because they\u2019re\na single card of very accurate customer data. After all, who has a business\ncard with the wrong email or their name misspelled? They can also be scanned\nstraight to the CRM or CMS. Tell your CEO who\u2019s still having the admin type\nthem into a spreadsheet.\n\nIdentify the types of contacts, especially business cards, see how you\u2019re\ngoing to digitize them (scanning, manual entry, etc.), and get them in the CRM\nor CMS. This will be the initial roundup, if necessary. Then make it a regular\nprocess. Mandate CRM/CMS use if you must, but be sure to make the benefits\nabundantly clear.\n\n### Automate the pain out of the process\n\nTo keep expanding the contact database, creating potential links, and to keep\ndata fresh, contacts must be entered on a daily basis.\n\n**The main methods of entering contacts into the CRM are:**\n\n  * **Manual data entry:** Manual data entry remains a complaint about CRMs, and it\u2019s a limitation in centralized contacts for simpler CRMs.\n  * **Integration/sync:** Integrations on Salesforce AppExchange and HubSpot Marketplace are specific for one CRM and work like plugins. They link the CRM with a specific service, like Outlook or Google Contacts. Third-party services like Zapier offer customized integrations needing little tech knowhow.\n  * [Scanning](https://www.g2.com/categories/business-card-scanning): A big win for business cards here, because a scanner removes most, or all, data entry. Simple scanners rely on basic optical character recognition (OCR) and the output usually needs some cleaning up. More advanced scanners incorporate AI and human verification so little or no cleanup is needed.\n\n[![Find the best Business Card Scanning Software on the market.

Sales prospecting starts in the company,\nnot with risky contact lists and buying of leads. Browse your company\u2019s leads,\ncontacts, and other contracts. Find a target, or someone a degree away, and\nask the contact\u2019s owner for an introduction.\n\nWith a culture of internal referrals, staff help each other. Coworkers from\ndifferent departments collaborate when otherwise they would\u2019ve been off in\ntheir own sections and branches. These positive relations are [scientifically\nproven](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-relationships-workplace/) to\nboost morale and prevent stress.\n\nGive and receive. That\u2019s good work culture, which is something salespeople\n[rate as more important than money](https://www.marcwayshak.com/sales-\nstatistics/). And when [54% of salespeople find their job\nstressful](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/average-work-week-sales), this can\ngo a long way to keeping them onboard. You may need a mandate at the start,\nbut it\u2019s best if staff see the logic and huge benefits, and if they buy in.\n\nTwo common psychological obstacles to the sharing approach are the fear of\nbeing \u201cfound out\u201d for the work you\u2019re doing and the reluctance to share\ncontacts for fear of someone stealing them.\n\nAccepting and overcoming these fears is the key to regular contact sharing.\nWhen they\u2019re ignored is when people go back to their own Gmail contact list,\niPhone address book, Rolodex, and so on. The benefits are many, but they\u2019re\nnot commonly understood.\n\n### Accentuate the positive\n\n[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/sales/contact-\nmanagement/) gets it: \u201cSalespeople need to lay aside their egos and find ways\nto work smartly together, harnessing their strengths in a complementary way\nfor the good of the whole team.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially in the case of complex deals, deals in danger of being lost,\nand deals where the rep lacks specific knowledge. But it should be extended to\nall deals. Sharing contacts and working cooperatively is a healthy way to\nwork, and technology makes it possible.\n\n![benefits of sharing contacts infographic](https://learn.g2.com/hs-\nfs/hubfs/G2%20Content%20Brief%20-%20Sansan-2.png?width=480&name=G2%20Content%20Brief%20-%20Sansan-2.png)\n\n### Getting everyone involved and onboard\n\nWhen [marketing and sales are collaborating with\nintent](https://resources.sansan.com/blog/handing-off-leads-how-to-get-sales-\nand-marketing-working-in-harmony), and all departments are on board on the CRM\nor CMS, you\u2019ll have a rich supply of leads at minimal CAC.\n\nThe new perspective here is you want to get all employees onboard and using\nthe system, not just sales and marketing. IT, HR, admin, everyone who collects\ncontacts needs a CRM user account, training, and ongoing support.\n\nSales ops can start this and serve as facilitators. It also helps to have\nadvocates on each team. Granted, some departments may find it odd to take part\nin this effort, but this is where CMS systems have an advantage for\ncentralizing contacts.\n\nThere are also non-sales situations where a centralized contact database comes\nin very handy. These include: seeking trustworthy suppliers, recruiting, and\ninviting attendees to events. Any situation in which you need to know someone\nbut lack a connection. Industry, academia, and government have all been found\nto benefit from centralized contact data and contact sharing.\n\n### Show commitment to the culture and reward those who embody it\n\nYou\u2019re asking quite a bit by having people share their contacts, and the\nbenefits may not resonate with people set in their ways. Sweeten the deal by\nadding on tools that are easy to learn and that will further encourage\ninteraction while reinforcing and rewarding great efforts to adapt.\n\n**These include:**\n\n  * [Internal communications software](https://www.g2.com/categories/internal-communications) like Workplace, Slack, and Chatter, which gives colleagues public and private spaces to communicate and set community rules.\n  * [Employee recognition software](https://www.g2.com/categories/employee-recognition) like Fond, Kudos, and Bonusly, where employees can commend one another, reinforce shared values, and be rewarded.\n  * [Org chart software](https://www.g2.com/categories/org-chart) like Pingboard and Names & Faces to help staff know one another between departments and across divisions and branches.\n\nEven better, survey your staff and see what they\u2019ve found and what they\u2019d love\nto have. Now you\u2019re culturally and digitally transforming.\n\n#### Embrace the pushback, push forward with collaboration, reap the rewards\n\nA salesperson\u2019s network is something they worked hard to build, and it\u2019s their\nmoneymaker. They\u2019re very protective of it, naturally, so implementing\ncentralized, shared contacts is bound to get pushback.\n\nTo be clear, reps don\u2019t need to share every contact they\u2019ve ever acquired (as\nwonderful as that would be). Their LinkedIn is theirs. Their iPhone address\nbook is theirs. But they do need to share contacts they acquire in the course\nof their work in the company. The same applies for people in all departments.\nProspecting and closing deals becomes a companywide project.\n\nWhen [86% of workers](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2012/09/nick-stein-work-\npost-2.html) cite a lack of collaboration for workplace failures, and when\ncompanies like Pixar deliberately design their offices so [people have random\nencounters](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the-science-\nbehind-the-growing-importance-of-collaboration) that spark new ideas, there\u2019s\nample proof that collaboration is desirable.\n\nAlso, if a salesperson moves on to another company, they don\u2019t take all their\ncontacts with them. Those leads are a corporate asset. When they\u2019re shared,\nanother rep on your team can take over the account.\n\nUse your tech, share and cooperate, and the cold in cold prospecting all but\nvanishes.\n\n**If you're looking for more ways to boost your prospecting success, check out\nwhat seasoned sales professionals say are must-dos for your prospecting\nefforts.  **\n\n**[![Learn more: Prospecting Tips \u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/ccdac114-6285-4290-b58b-742b3ace5a3f.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/ccdac114-6285-4290-b58b-742b3ace5a3f)**\n\n[ ![Adam\nGoulston](https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/G2%20Content%20Brief%20-%20Sansan.jpeg)\n](https://learn.g2.com/author/adam-goulston)\n\n[ Adam Goulston ](https://learn.g2.com/author/adam-goulston)\n\n[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamgoulston/)\n\nAdam Goulston is a US-born, Tokyo-based digital marketer and writer serving\ncompanies, NGOs, and academia in multiple countries.

It announced on Wednesday\nthat it has raised $1.75 million in seed stage financing led by Active\nCapital. And it\u2019s creating software that lets enterprise companies connect to\nother applications seamlessly.\n\nRick Barkley, Founder and CEO of Cloudsnap, last year spun the company out of\nNuvola Networks, an elearning and software development startup he founded in\n2011.\n\n\u201cRick has actually been running a software business for several years now and\nCloudsnap was born out of that business,\u201d said Pat Matthews, Founder and CEO\nof Active Capital.\n\n\u201cHe was starting to spin Cloudsnap out of his ed tech business. He had never\nraised any money. He was at the Capital Factory accelerator. Through that he\njust discovered us,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nOne day Barkley sent Matthews a cold email and next they talked on the phone\nand started to build a relationship from there, Matthews said.\n\nActive Capital also participated in Cloudsnap\u2019s pre-seed round six months ago.\n\nActive Capital recently raised a $21.5 million fund to invest in early stage\nbusiness to business startups that focus on software as a service. In Austin,\nActive Capital has invested in [Pingboard](https://pingboard.com/org-chart-\napp), [Servable](https://www.srvbl.com/), [Living\nSecurity](https://www.livingsecurity.com/),\n[CloudSnap](https://www.livingsecurity.com/), and [Prosper\nOps](https://www.prosperops.com/). And in San Antonio, Active Capital has\ninvested in [FunnelAI](https://funnelai.co/) and\n[SendSpark](https://conversationalvideo.com/). It has other investments in San\nFrancisco and New York.\n\n\u201cThe more business apps there are in the world \u2013 the more integrating these\napps together is a big deal,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cRight now, Cloudsnap is really\nfocused on ERP integration.\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n  *   *   *   *   * [Email](http://siliconhillsnews.com/2019/03/27/cloudsnap-raises-1-75-million/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  * [Print](http://siliconhillsnews.com/2019/03/27/cloudsnap-raises-1-75-million/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * [Share on Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/share/link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiliconhillsnews.com%2F2019%2F03%2F27%2Fcloudsnap-raises-1-75-million%2F&name=Cloudsnap%20Raises%20%241.75%20Million \"Share on Tumblr\")\n  *   * [![](//assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiliconhillsnews.com%2F2019%2F03%2F27%2Fcloudsnap-raises-1-75-million%2F&media=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fd932a7d53a215d27a4212cc32c49987a%3Fs%3D96%26d%3Dmm%26r%3Dg&description=Cloudsnap%20Raises%20%241.75%20Million)\n\n  * \n\nFiled Under: [Austin](http://siliconhillsnews.com/category/austintechnology/)\n\nSubscribe to the Silicon Hills News newsletter\n\n[![](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/silicon-hills-\nad-250x175-2x-300x210.jpg)](https://sanabenefits.com/)\n\n[Become a Patron!](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=380378)\n\n#### Please Like us on Facebook\n\n[Silicon Hills News](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silicon-Hills-\nNews/217470964960195 \"Silicon Hills News\")  \n[![](http://badge.facebook.com/badge/217470964960195.2654.18252917.png)](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silicon-\nHills-News/217470964960195 \"Silicon Hills News\")  \n[Promote Your Page Too](http://www.facebook.com/business/dashboard/ \"Make your\nown badge!\")\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 * [News Theme](http://www.studiopress.com/themes/news) on\n[Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com/) *\n[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) * [Log in](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-\nlogin.php)\n\nSend to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address\n![loading](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack-\nsharing/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif) Cancel\n\nPost was not sent -

He has also invested as an angel investor in more than\n50 startup companies.\n\nMatthews is passionate about working with entrepreneurs who are building\namazing businesses.\n\n\u201cFor the companies we\u2019re investing in it allows them to have one major\ninvestor in the seed stage round \u2013 as opposed to 15 or 20 investors to put\ntogether over time,\u201d Matthews said.\n\n\"Pat is one of the rare founders that has built a successful company from\nscratch, had a great exit, and then had equal success as an executive in a\nlarge, fast-growing company,\" Graham Weston, co-founder and former chairman of\nRackspace, and an investor in Active Capital, said in a news release.  \"Pat\nhas a unique ability to relate to founders and really knows how to leverage\nhis experiences to help them through the process of building a great company.\nHe really has a lot to offer today's entrepreneur.\"\n\n\"I've been working with Pat since I invested in Webmail in 2005,\" Pat Condon,\nco-founder of Rackspace, board partner and investor in Active Capital, said in\na news release. \"Pat has an amazing way of connecting with entrepreneurs and I\nenjoy collaborating with him and the founders we invest in.\"\n\nIn 1999, Matthews along with Bill Boebel and Kevin Minnick, founded\nFieldParty.com, which created searchable city event directories. They dropped\nout of Virginia Tech University just 20 hours short of getting their degrees\nto work on the business full time. FieldParty.com raised $120,000 in angel\nmoney, largely from friends and family, and on March 10, 2000, the website\nlaunched \u2013 the same day the Nasdaq started crashing when the great Dot Com\nbubble burst.\n\nThey pivoted the business from a dot com to a B2B SaaS company. It was very\ntough time for the Internet economy overall and for the company, Matthews\nsaid.\n\n\u201cI sold books door to door in Southwest Virginia,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI worked in\nmany different sales jobs.\u201d\n\nMatthews also had to figure out how to manage $100,000 each in credit card\ndebt.\n\n\u201cIt really has shaped a lot of what I do today,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI\u2019m attracted\nto companies that are capital disciplined. Companies that have made a lot of\nprogress on very little capital. Founders who have got product to market and\nhave generated revenue and raised little capital to date. They are only\nraising money relative to the size of the opportunity in front of them.\u201d\n\nMatthews\u2019 journey buys him a lot of credibility with founders, he said.\n\n\u201cIt allows me to give them tough feedback when needed,\u201d Matthews said.\n\n\u201cI want to use my experience to help them where I can. I really want to invest\nin great founders and inspiring founders that are building great companies,\u201d\nMatthews said. \u201cThe right investors and the right advisors can really help\nfounders not screw up the company along the way.\u201d\n\n_**Editor\u2019s note** : Active Capital was one of the sponsors of the Silicon\nHills News\u2019 recent 2019 Austin Calendar Party and Silicon Hills News is\nhosting[ a lunch and learn in Austin with Chris Saum of Active\nCapital](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ask-me-anything-with-vc-chris-saum-from-\nactive-capital-tickets-54923988127) later this month. _\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n  *   *   *   *   * [Email](http://siliconhillsnews.com/2019/02/01/san-antonio-based-active-capital-raises-21-5-million-vc-fund/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  * [Print](http://siliconhillsnews.com/2019/02/01/san-antonio-based-active-capital-raises-21-5-million-vc-fund/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * [Share on Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/share/link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiliconhillsnews.com%2F2019%2F02%2F01%2Fsan-antonio-based-active-capital-raises-21-5-million-vc-fund%2F&name=San%20Antonio-based%20Active%20Capital%20Raises%20%2421.5%20Million%20VC%20Fund \"Share on Tumblr\")\n  *   * [![](//assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiliconhillsnews.com%2F2019%2F02%2F01%2Fsan-antonio-based-active-capital-raises-21-5-million-vc-fund%2F&media=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fd932a7d53a215d27a4212cc32c49987a%3Fs%3D96%26d%3Dmm%26r%3Dg&description=San%20Antonio-based%20Active%20Capital%20Raises%20%2421.5%20Million%20VC%20Fund)\n\n  * \n\nFiled Under: [San Antonio](http://siliconhillsnews.com/category/san-antonio-\ntechnology/)\n\nSubscribe to the Silicon Hills News newsletter\n\n[![](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/silicon-hills-\nad-250x175-2x-300x210.jpg)](https://sanabenefits.com/)\n\n[Become a Patron!](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=380378)\n\n#### Please Like us on Facebook\n\n[Silicon Hills News](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silicon-Hills-\nNews/217470964960195 \"Silicon Hills News\")  \n[![](http://badge.facebook.com/badge/217470964960195.2654.18252917.png)](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silicon-\nHills-News/217470964960195 \"Silicon Hills News\")  \n[Promote Your Page Too](http://www.facebook.com/business/dashboard/ \"Make your\nown badge!\")\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 * [News Theme](http://www.studiopress.com/themes/news) on\n[Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com/) *\n[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) * [Log in](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-\nlogin.php)\n\nSend to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address\n![loading](http://siliconhillsnews.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack-\nsharing/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif) Cancel\n\nPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\n\nEmail check failed, please try again\n\nSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\n\n"}, {"item": "Six tips to build better design systems - The Media Temple Blog", "link": "https://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/six-tips-build-better-design-systems/", "guid": "CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWF0ZW1wbGUubmV0L2Jsb2cvdGlwcy9zaXgtdGlwcy1idWlsZC1iZXR0ZXItZGVzaWduLXN5c3RlbXMv0gEA", "pubdate": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/six-tips-build-better-design-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">Six tips to build better design systems</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Media Temple Blog</font>", "source": "The Media Temple Blog", "body": "[ ![\\(mt\\) Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net/blog/wp-content/themes/mt-\nblog-theme-nova/_novastrap/_img/mt-logo-dark-graphite.png)\n](//mediatemple.net)\n\n  * [Back to MediaTemple](//mediatemple.net)\n  * Hosting ____\n\n    * [Managed Services for AWS](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/aws-management)\n    * [DV - VPS Hosting](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/vps-hosting)\n    * [Grid - Shared Hosting](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/shared-hosting)\n    * [Managed WordPress](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/managed-wordpress)\n    * [Dedicated Hosting](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dedicated-server)\n\n  * [Blog Home](https://mediatemple.net/blog/)\n  * [News](https://mediatemple.net/blog/news/)\n  * [Tips & Tutorials](https://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/)\n  * [About](https://mediatemple.net/blog/about/)\n  * [Made on (mt)](https://mediatemple.net/blog/madeonmt/)\n  * __\n\n# Six tips to build better design systems\n\n__ December 20, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s been the year of the design system. Companies launch new design systems\nalmost every week, and most executives now understand their value. Design\nsystems includes style guides, pattern libraries, CSS frameworks, and design\noperations. Designers and developers feel empowered by a ton of resources, and\nthere are conferences entirely dedicated to design systems (mostly notably\n[Clarity](https://www.clarityconf.com/) in the US and [Design Systems\nLondon](https://www.designsystemslondon.com/) in Europe).\n\nThe barrier to entry is now lower, but with so much information out there, it\ncan be overwhelming and difficult to know exactly what advice applies to your\nown work \u2014 especially if you\u2019re trying to build a design system at a smaller\norganisation.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked insiders who built design systems at Slack, HubSpot, GoDaddy, IBM,\nand Lloyds Banking Group for their tips on how to build better design systems.\nHere\u2019s what they recommend:\n\n## 1\\. Understand the context your design system has to operate in\n\n\u201cEvery new design system starts with dreamy aspirations to be the next [Airbnb\nDLS](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/) or [Google\u2019s Material\nDesign](https://material.io/design/),\u201d finds [Lily\nDart](http://lilydart.com/), Design Language Delivery Lead at Lloyds Banking\nGroup. \u201cBut for those of us who don\u2019t work in truly agile, user-centred\norganisations like AirBnb or Google, trying to replicate those examples can be\na mistake.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lily, the real trick to creating a design system that works is to\nunderstand the context and culture it has to operate in. An agile organisation\nwon\u2019t appreciate \u2018perfect\u2019 releases once every six months, while a waterfall\norganisation will want slow releases, but they\u2019ll also expect you to maintain\nolder versions if they\u2019re in production.\n\n\u201cOnce you understand your context and culture, you can think about how your\ndesign system can improve it,\u201d Lily explains. \u201cWant to boost efficiency?\nDefine as many pre-made\n[patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) as you can to speed\nup the team. Want to boost creativity? Go the opposite route \u2014 keep patterns\nminimal, instead providing\n[atoms](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) to give designers\nflexibility.\u201d\n\nIn the end, a design system is just that, Lily points out \u2014 a\n[_system_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System). \u201cAnd systems don\u2019t exist in\nisolation. If you don\u2019t work for Airbnb, then don\u2019t recreate products designed\nfor their team and their users. Focus on solving the problems you face every\nday, and you\u2019ll create a beautiful design system.\u201d\n\n[![Google\u2019s Material Design is great, but don\u2019t recreate design systems that\nhave a different context. Focus on the problems you face\ninstead.](https://mediatemple.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/12/googlematerialdesign-e1545250317273.png)](https://mediatemple.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/12/googlematerialdesign-e1545250317273.png)\n\nGoogle\u2019s Material Design is great, but don\u2019t recreate design systems that have\na different context. Focus on the problems you face instead.\n\n## 2\\. Stay unique and save overhead\n\nAlso question whether your company actually has a need for a completely new\ndesign system, suggests [James Y Rauhut](https://seejamescode.com/), a front-\nend developer and UX designer at Pingboard.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful design systems manifest from a unique philosophy a company\nhas,\u201d he explains. \u201cGoogle\u2019s Material Design believes an experience extends\npast the glass screen you interact with. Microsoft\u2019s [Fluent\nDesign](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) believes an experience\nadapts to the window it occupies. Will your design system have a unique point\nof view? If not, you may want to adopt an existing design system to save\nyourself the technical debt.\u201d\n\nEven if you do have that unique perspective that will separate your system\nfrom the rest, you don\u2019t have to reinvent smaller wheels. Here are some tools\nthat James recommends to make it easier to release a design system and keep\nthe company aligned:\n\n  * [Framer X](https://framer.com/teams/)\u2019s Team Store for design\n  * [Reach UI](https://ui.reach.tech/)\u2019s base components for accessibility\n  * [Grid Wiz](https://grid-wiz.now.sh/)\u2019s CSS Grid framework generator for layout\n\nBefore James joined Pingboard, he worked at IBM Design. In this talk he\nexplains how efforts like CSS\u200b Grid allow you to push what a design system\ndoes and how IBM is building a design system for their 350,000 members of\nstaff:\n\n## 3\\. Define a process, not a project\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to think about a redesign or creating a design system as a\nproject,\u201d admits [Lara Tacito](https://twitter.com/laramata), senior manager\n(product design) at HubSpot. \u201cIn fact, it may need to start out that way to\nget buy-in or momentum. But the only way to see real success and not have to\nredesign every year is to define a process and treat define the process like a\nproduct.\u201d\n\nLara suggests that the first step, like in any standard design process, should\nbe to figure out the current workflows of the people who will be using the\ndesign system.\n\n\u201cA few simple interviews will go a long way,\u201d she explains. \u201cThen find ways to\nsimplify that process, still meet the users\u2019 needs, and make it undoubtedly\neasy to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nLara also recommends bringing your design and implementation documentation\ntogether. \u201cThere are complexity tradeoffs to this, but at the end of the day\nwe've found that the more designers know about the implementation, the better\noff they are \u2014 and engineers who know more about the design guidelines make\nbetter decisions for the user.\u201d\n\nFinally, Lara suggests involving **the team who will be using the design\nsystem** in the process because it helps educate them on how the process\nworks, allows for a broader set of skills and contributions, and helps\naccountability and autonomy.\n\nWatch Lara\u2019s Talk UX presentation on building an evergreen design system that\nmakes life easier for both your customers and your team:\n\n\n\n## 4\\. Focus on communication\n\n\u201cDesign systems are 80% communication and 20% doing the work,\u201d points out\n[Garrett Miller](https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett), staff engineer at Slack.\n\nWhile establishing the foundational component architecture is an absolute\nnecessity, Garrett has found that far more work is involved in making the case\nfor resourcing and prioritization within the wider organization.\n\n\u201cThis takes a tremendous amount of focus on collaboration,\u201d he advises. \u201cIt\nrequires negotiation with stakeholders to clear a path for such a large\ninvestment in your design infrastructure. The success of a design system is\nthe result of how well its advocate is able to navigate the tensions between\nall sides involved in these conversations.\u201d\n\nGarrett recommends focusing on the business case for the investment in your\ncommunication.\n\n\u201cDesign systems allow us to accelerate growth with lower risk of regressions.\nSurprises cost money and time, both things that your company is likely trying\nto save.\u201d\n\n## 5\\. Increase contributions through modularity\n\nBy their nature, design systems tend to be monolithic instead of modular.\n[Charlie Robbins](https://twitter.com/indexzero), senior director of\nengineering (UX platform) at GoDaddy, recommends focusing on modularity,\nhowever, as it has two major benefits for the community you want to foster\naround any design system.\n\n\u201cFirst, a modular and decoupled design system encourages users to take\nindividual components and combine them with other design systems to meet their\nspecific needs,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis increases the pool of possible\ncontributors.\u201d\n\nFor a first-time contributor, even a small design system can be overwhelming\nto contribute to, though. \u201cA modular approach can make updating or adding new\ncomponents or documentation to your design system more approachable since a\nnew contributor only needs to understand that one component,\u201d Charlie points\nout. \u201cBy embracing modularity and\n\u2018[emptiness](https://www.muji.com/us/flagship/huaihai755/archive/hara.html)\u2019\nwhenever possible, your community will have fewer barriers to growth.\u201d\n\n## 6\\. Be mindful of decision debt\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest gotchas, when working with design systems at scale, is the\nidea that not making a decision is, in fact, a decision,\u201d warns [Sarah\nFederman](https://twitter.com/sarah_federman), design engineer at Adobe.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make a choice to put off setting a standard or creating a\nprocess, you accumulate decision debt, which can be just as \u2014 if not more \u2014\nharmful as design debt or tech debt,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen you put off a\ndecision being made within your system, you put the onus on your users to make\nthe decision. The result might not be one you like, and it certainly won't be\none that's consistent across products.\u201d\n\nIn Sarah\u2019s experience, decision debt especially comes into play when you need\nto make far reaching design decisions around typography and spacing, but also\nwhen you need to make process decisions, such as how to version your system.\n\u201cUsers will develop expectations around what support they'll receive or the\nstability of your system,\u201d she advises, \u201cand you'll be fighting those\nexpectations in the future.\u201d\n\nAlso important is the decision \u2014 or more ideally requirement \u2014 to create an\ninclusive system. \u201cBuilding in accessibility after the fact is much more\ndifficult and effects the most fundamental parts of your system, such and\ncolors and sizing.\u201d\n\nIn the end, design systems should be adaptable, but starting with a solid and\nflexible foundation is the easiest way to enable change down the line.\n\n\u201cDecision debt isn't always bad, but it is something to be mindful of and take\non strategically,\u201d Sarah concludes.\n\n[Click here to build your next great project on Media\nTemple](https://mediatemple.net/?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blogpost&utm_campaign=core&content=blogseries_lindberg).\n\n#### Author\n\n![](https://mediatemple.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/08/image15-380x380.jpg)\n\n**Oliver Lindberg**\n\nOliver is an independent editor, content consultant, and founder of the Pixel\nPioneers events series.

While\nActive\u2019s investments cover a wide range of software businesses across the\ncountry--from startups focused on accounting to cybersecurity to cloud\ncomputing--a common theme among them is that they\u2019re founder-led businesses,\nsays Pat Matthews, the CEO and general partner of the firm. Active has made 20\ninvestments so far.\n\nActive Capital is pursuing SaaS businesses anywhere in the country, not just\nin Central Texas, and it is placing a particular focus on areas outside of\ntraditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley.[ That investment focus has been of\ngrowing interest](https://xconomy.com/national/2018/07/03/are-you-a-saas-\nstartup-private-equity-may-soon-be-coming-for-you/) among investors and\nacquirers in Texas and nationally. Mercury Fund, which has offices in Houston,\nTX, and Ann Arbor, MI, said last year it was focusing on funding SaaS, cloud\nservices, and data analytics companies with recurring revenue. San Antonio-\nbased Scaleworks and [Dura\nHoldings](https://xconomy.com/texas/2018/06/20/same-saas-new-acquisition-\nmodel-qa-with-duras-paul-salisbury/), as well as Austin-based BuildGroup, have\nsimilar interests. In 2007, AOL co-founder Steve Case announced a $150 million\nventure fund, Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, aimed at pumping [investment capital\ninto tech companies in so-called flyover states](https://xconomy.com/detroit-\nann-arbor/2017/12/05/cases-150m-rise-of-the-rest-fund-aims-to-boost-flyover-\nstartups/).\n\nMatthews says he believes there\u2019s plenty of room for all the investment\ncapital as more people start building businesses in emerging tech hubs\nthroughout the country. Businesses that need to still be in Silicon Valley\nwill still move there--and Active could invest in them too--but others will\nsprout up in new areas, and venture firms are responding to that, he says.\n\n\u201cI think venture capital is really starting to specialize and move away from\n(having) a few firms in concentrated markets,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to\nsee tech ecosystems emerge in all different parts of the country. You\u2019re going\nto see venture capital dollars start to invest there. I think we\u2019re very much\non the forefront of that.\u201d\n\nMatthews, a former startup executive himself, says he wants to take the lead\non the seed investments he makes through Active. Cat Dizon, the executive\ndirector of angel investment firm Alamo Angels, and Pat Condon, a founder of\ncloud computing giant Rackspace, are working with Matthews as partners at\nActive Capital.\n\n\u201cI like to think of us as founders that have built the kind of businesses\nwe\u2019re investing in,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cAs a small fund we\u2019re designed to lead.\nWe\u2019re not designed to follow the lead or join the party round.\u201d\n\nActive Capital is Matthews\u2019 first time as the general partner of a venture\nfirm, though he has been an active angel investor for almost a decade. (He is\nalso a founding board member of San Antonio-based Alamo Angels.) At Virginia\nTech, Matthews met the co-founders of his first successful startup,\nWebmail.us, which sold in 2007 to San Antonio\u2019s Rackspace in an all-stock deal\nthat Matthews said [has been valued at about $50\nmillion](https://xconomy.com/seattle/2018/06/04/why-microsoft-bought-github-\nfor-7-5b-and-what-developers-think/). More recently, Matthews was the CEO of\nFilestack, a SaaS business in [San Antonio owned by investment firm\nScaleworks](https://xconomy.com/texas/2017/08/23/filestack-maker-of-file-\nuploading-api-hires-new-ceo-sameer-kamat/).\n\nMatthews taps into an ever-growing network of people he\u2019s worked with\nthroughout his career to raise the funds, he says, some of which came from\nformer angel investors and other from former business partners. That includes\nSan Antonio billionaire Graham Weston, the former CEO of Rackspace who was\nexecutive chairman when the company acquired Matthews\u2019s Webmail.us business.\n\n\u201cPat has a unique ability to relate to founders and really knows how to\nleverage his experiences to help them through the process of building a great\ncompany,\u201d Weston says, according to a news release.\n\nMatthews believes venture dollars will still seek startups outside the usual\ntech hot spots even as financial markets, especially in tech, have had a\ntumultuous ride over the last few months. It didn\u2019t limit his ability to raise\ncapital, Matthews contends, even if some potential limited partners did say no\nto investing. He says he believes the investors who did participate in his\nfirst venture fund believed in his ability to work closely with startup\nexecutives on being financially disciplined, as well as his desire to work\nclosely with the founders of the businesses in which Active invests. Active\nCapital has invested about a third of its fund so far, and may not put the\nfull remainder in new businesses, retaining some of the funds for its existing\ninvestments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the influential investor,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cWe only invest in companies\nwe\u2019ve helped build.\u201d\n\nSome of those businesses include San Antonio-based [artificial intelligence\nsoftware maker FunnelAI](https://xconomy.com/texas/2019/01/11/to-buy-or-not-\nto-buy-funnelai-studies-consumers-intent-to-purchase/), which studies a\nconsumer\u2019s intent to purchase cars or auto services; [San Antonio\u2019s Flightpath\nFinance](https://xconomy.com/texas/2018/11/20/startup-flightpath-finance-\nsnags-seed-funding-from-active-capital/), which works with customers\u2019\naccounting software; and Austin-based organizational [chart software maker\nPingboard](https://xconomy.com/texas/2018/05/31/former-startup-founders-\nreunite-years-later-for-pingboard-seed-round/).\n\nMatthews found success as an angel investor before branching out with his own\nfirm. One early investment was Favor, a delivery app founded in Austin in\n2013. Favor sold to H-E-B, the national grocery chain of Texas and the state\u2019s\nlargest private employer, last year for an undisclosed price. Matthews got to\nknow Favor\u2019s founders, Zac Maurais and Ben Doherty, as an early investor in\nthe company. After they left Favor, Matthews invested in their new business,\nSunroom Rentals, and Maurais and Doherty invested in Matthews\u2019s Active\nCapital.\n\n\u201cI built a great relationship with Ben and Zac,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cI did it all\nthat through coaching and guidance and tough love. And I\u2019m really proud of\nit.\u201d\n\nDavid Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

He will remain on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cI speak for the entire Solheim and Ping families when I say how extremely\ngrateful we are for the impact Doug has had on the company in the last 45\nyears,\u201d said John Solheim, Ping chairman & CEO. \u201cHis accomplishments are too\nlong to list, but we all agree his leadership and contributions are evident\ncompany wide. He\u2019s led countless efforts and initiatives to help build Ping\ninto the industry-leading company we are today.\u201d\n\nA 1971 graduate of Arizona State University, Hawken was a world-class\nsprinter, something that he once joked was, \u201cmany years and many pounds ago.\u201d\nHe also was in need of employment. \u201cI was blessed that Allan Solheim offered\nme a job,\u201d Hawken said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what he wrote on my application:\n\u2018This guy has potential.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat potential manifested itself over his 45 years with the company, a career\nthat began as a jack-of-all trades production manager. From there Hawken\nbecame was involved in the manufacturing end, followed by a leadership\nposition overseeing the wood business. Hawken then was promoted to plant\nmanager overseeing all production with another promotion to VP of marketing\nand production to follow. In 1999 he was promoted to president and chief\noperating officer, making him the highest-ranked non-Solheim family member in\nthe company.\n\n\u201c[This] journey allowed me to work and share leadership responsibilities with\nKarsten and John Solheim, who empowered me to become more visible throughout\nthe company and within the industry,\u201d said Hawken. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to them and\ntheir family for the opportunities they provided me and I\u2019m honored to\ncontinue to serve on Ping\u2019s board of directors. We\u2019re in the business of\ncreating and sustaining meaningful jobs. We accomplish this by designing and\nmanufacturing the best golf equipment in the world. It\u2019s an innovative\napproach that I\u2019m passionate about and one I\u2019ll endorse over any other. I\u2019m\nproud to be associated with a company that puts the well-being of its\nemployees and their families above all else.\u201d\n\nHawken gained additional business\u2014and life\u2014perspective during a cross-country\nmotorcycle trip he took in 2000.\n\n\u201cThat was a lifelong dream of mine,\u201d Hawken told Golf World Business at the\ntime. \u201cIt was one of the most enjoyable things I\u2019ve ever done. I met a bunch\nof people out there that don\u2019t play golf and had never heard of Ping. I never\nwent through any large cities. I went all back roads and it took 11 days. But\nI came back refreshed and with more perspective. I learned that your family,\nfriends and your business are all important, but you have to strike a balance.\nIf you stay strictly within the realm of business and how you make your\nliving, then a lot of life will pass you by.

By extension, app vendors can view, delete,\nexternalize and store corporate data. The report is based on an analysis of 10\nmillion users, 1 billion files, and 160,000 unique applications. The report\nnames the top 10 riskiest apps, the top 10 banned apps and the top 10 trusted\napps and offers recommendations on how to securely manage third-party\napplications.\n\n\n\n_ This article was originally published on 06-30-2016_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_Karen A.

Supreme Lending is\nAtlanta\u2019s top business in the small division with 150 or fewer employees.\n\nPhoto: David Tulis / AJC Special\n\nPhoto: David Tulis / AJC Special\n\n# Leaders of top workplaces share their views\n\n[Business](/news/business/)\n\nBy\n\n  * Lori Johnston, Fast Copy News Service\n\n## Executives use technology, goal-setting and core values to create\nsupportive settings.\n\n_More than 2,300 companies were nominated or asked to participate in the[\n**2018 Top Workplaces contest by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and its\npartner, Energage**](https://www.ajc.com/top-workplaces/) (formerly Workplace\nDynamics). Employees across the metro area responded to print and online\nsolicitations that began appearing in September._\n\n_Using survey results, a list of 150 workplaces was compiled, consisting of 25\nlarge companies (listed below; 500 or more employees), 50 midsize companies\n(150-499 employees) and 75 small companies (149 or fewer employees)._\n\nThe top small, midsize and large workplace leaders discussed how to build a\nstrong culture and how to keep your mission at the forefront.\n\nAnswers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n**What are key components of the firm 's culture?**\n\n**Janine Brown, partner-in-charge of Alston & Bird's Atlanta office:** Client\nservice and teamwork are the cornerstones of all that we do. Alston & Bird's\nculture and core values have been cultivated for more than a century. They\ndefine who we are and how we interact with our clients and with each other. A\nlot has changed about the business of law in that time, but our culture of\ncollegiality, teamwork, loyalty, diversity, fairness and professional\ndevelopment have always been, and continue to be, the guiding principles by\nwhich we measure ourselves.\n\n**Rob Forman, chief operating officer, SalesLoft:** We define culture as\nvalues consistently applied. As we put our values into action, the behavioral\nenvironment around us, that is our culture. Then in that culture, we have a\nhigh-trust, high-performing environment where we can have lots of perks that\npeople can enjoy.\n\n**What is your company doing to retain workers and keep them satisfied?**\n\n**Pat Flood, regional operating partner, Supreme Lending 's Southeast\nregion:** Our turnover rate last year was less than 5 percent. We hire well.\nMost people focus as employers on what experiences and talent people have. We\nfocus on whether or not the things that we think are important in life are\nimportant to the folks that we're talking to. We take the time to make sure\nthat we're hiring right, meaning our values and theirs are compatible. I think\nthey get an authentic experience, which is what they heard when they were\ntalking to us.\n\n**Kyle Porter, CEO, SalesLoft:** Give them meaningful work, big goals and tie\nthose goals to the major outcomes for our customers that they can be proud of.\n\n**Brown:** We manage our low retention rates not only by offering competitive\nsalaries and benefits packages but also by providing opportunities for our\nemployees to learn, engage in the community and bring their whole selves to\nwork. Our Atlanta office has a \"21 Club,\" consisting of 75 staff employees who\nhave a tenure of 20 years or more with the firm. The club hosts special\ncelebrations and meets quarterly to celebrate the firm's rich history and to\ndiscuss how to role model our core values as the workplace continues to\nevolve.\n\n**How do you use technology to positively influence your workplace culture?**\n\n**Porter:** We use aggressive video conferencing so our people can connect\nwith our customers, prospects and each other via video. We have a system\ncalled Pingboard -- an employee directory with neat facts, games to remember\ntheir names. We use Slack for internal communications and have neat channels,\nlike the \"thank you\" channel, where someone gives thanks to someone else for\nwhat they've done for them and the business.\n\n**Brown:** We believe that technology positively impacts our workplace by\nenabling productivity while providing a secure environment protecting the data\nof both our clients and the firm itself. Some examples include complete remote\ncapabilities, especially when inclement weather conditions prevent easy access\nto our buildings. Similarly, on-the-go mobile device options include email and\nnetwork access, along with time entry and firm directory apps. Our firm-\nsupplied laptops have video capabilities and built-in software for screen\nsharing and collaboration, and we have interlinked video conference rooms in\nall our offices. These recently updated rooms are used for meetings and\nevents, including a monthly firmwide video conference with presentations by\nlawyers and firm leadership. Our firm portal serves as our communications hub,\nallowing us to share news and important information. It includes links to our\nPro Bono site that lists opportunities to volunteer and participate in\ncommunity programs, a sustainability page to promote green initiatives, and an\nAlston & Bird alumni website.\n\n**Flood:** We have associates spread out through a number of markets, and we\nnow have a new studio so we can do livestreaming to our associates. We can\nparticipate either in a business meeting or a motivational meeting. So we're\nusing the medium to communicate, remind, encourage, motivate and teach.\n\n**What do you do to encourage new ideas from employees?**\n\n**Forman:  **Every month, they vote on one thing that is sort of annoying them\nthat we want to fix. So don't come without a solution. It could be noise. It\ncould be chairs. Every month, they bubble it up and then we allocate resources\nto solve the problem. That's where Pingboard came from. They said, it's hard\nto know who works where and what their names are. They found the solution. We\nbought the software and now we use it.\n\n**Brown:** Even the most junior professionals know that their ideas will be\nheard, so brainstorming often occurs organically over lunch or in meetings. To\nfurther encourage input, we conduct town hall meetings with senior human\nresources leadership, we have Atlanta office committees for pro bono and\ncommunity service, as well as diversity and inclusion, and we maintain other\nformats for continuous feedback in employee reviews, internal surveys and an\nonline suggestion box.\n\n**Flood:** We tell people all the time there are no bad ideas. We're always\ninterested in getting better. If there's anything we can ever do to get\nbetter, we ought to discover that and everybody here has a responsibility to\ncontribute to it.\n\n**How do employees have an opportunity to voice opinions or give feedback to\ntheir supervisors?**\n\n**Brown:  **Both formal and informal feedback is welcome here, in the form of\ntown hall meetings, feedback sessions and the work of our many committees\nthroughout the Atlanta office. In fall 2017, we conducted hourlong feedback\nluncheons with five groups of Atlanta legal administrative assistants during\nwhich they were introduced to a new feedback communication model. They were\nthen given an open forum to share successes and challenges with their manager,\nthe director of human resources and diversity and our chief human resources\nofficer.\n\n**Flood:** Everyone in the organization has access to me. They can call me.\nThey can email me. I don't have an administrative assistant or a secretary,\nand I have hired every single person that's employed here. I build a personal\nrelationship with them, and they feel comfortable to pick up the phone and\ncall me.\n\n**How does the company help employees stay current?**\n\n**Forman:  **If someone will invest in and commit to reading something, I'll\nbuy them the book, if they'll write me the summary. Other leaders and\ndepartment heads do it, too. We specifically like the books because of the\nquality of depth, but there are other programs. There are certain video\nscreencasts that we subscribe them to. They're doing that constantly. One of\nthe big things we do is we just encourage them to take the time to do it.\nWe've bought outside speakers (such as Charlie Paparelli, Rusty Gordon and\nLisa McLeod). We just want them to be hearing from others as well.\n\n**Brown:** We encourage an entrepreneurial spirit, providing opportunities to\nunleash our talents in order to grow professionally and personally. Examples\nof how we promote this philosophy include continuous culture and service\ndelivery training, technology training sessions, communication preferences\ntraining, personal and financial wellness education, business development\nseminars, individual career coaching, formal and organic mentorship\nopportunities, conference attendance, client-involved learning events and many\nmore.\n\n**Flood:** There's a professional license update that's required annually, and\nso we fund all of that, which is not insignificant in terms of its cost. We do\nan awful lot of training, particularly with new associates when they come in,\nnot just on the job, but we have outsource programs (he estimates they invest\nabout $1,500 in the first year for each new hire). And then we do a number of\ndifferent regulatory and otherwise trainings in the organization. It amounts\nto a pretty substantial amount of money every year that we do put investments\nin.\n\n**What hiring activity has your company experienced recently? In what ways is\nthis the result of changes to your hiring processes?**\n\n**Forman:** We want to hire over 100 people (in 2018). We recently hired a\nchief people officer. She is continuing on a lot of things that Kyle and I\nbuilt in the early days and enhancing some things that we've wanted to grow.\nWe need a lot of great people. That means we have to work really hard to find\nthem and recruit them.\n\n**Brown:** The newly designed website has been one of the biggest changes\naffecting our hiring process. We were able to revise our career pages to\ninclude more videos and employee testimonials. The website's main audience is\nprospective clients, but we have heard from multiple candidates that our\nwebsite was a factor in their attraction to the firm.\n\n**Flood:** We grew from, maybe five years ago, having 50 or 60 people to\nhaving around 165 associates. We feel like the next couple of years will be\nbetween 150 to 200 associates. We did almost $1.2 billion in (revenue) last\nyear. We financed about 5,500 homes. So we're big enough. I don't want to get\nso big that I lose a sense of personal relationship with the folks that are\nhere.\n\n**How often do you look at your benefits package, and what is a recent\nupdate?**\n\n**Forman:** We revisit our benefits package usually annually. Sometimes ideas\nwill come up quarterly. One recent shift we made is that we shifted the mix on\nhow much we pay for family plans versus individuals so that we could pay more\nfor people who do have families. We pay 100 percent of it for individuals, but\nwe increased the percentage of people we pay for people with families.\n\n**Brown:** Alston & Bird monitors our benefits offerings on an ongoing basis\nthrough a variety of sources, including surveys, insurance consultants,\nseminars and roundtable networking. In fact, an industry trend led to a recent\nchange in the parental leave policy for attorneys that now includes a flex-\ntime component to assist attorneys with the transition to/from the workplace\neither before or after their leave.\n\n**What leadership principles do you abide by?**\n\n**Brown:  **I personally think it's incredibly important to be a good\nlistener, and that's an essential part of leadership.\n\n**Forman:** Leadership is fundamentally about taking care of people. It's\nabout not being in charge, but taking care of those in your charge. Another\nleadership principal is around servant leadership. Our role is to set\ndirection, to make decisions, but a lot of it is to get out of the way and\nenable our people to do what they're good at, and then take accountability if\nsomething's off track and pass off credit if something goes right.\n\n**Flood:** My first responsibility is to be a good and godly Christian man.\nWhat I'm required to do is treat them better than they deserve to be treated\nbecause that's really kind of the Christian life -- not judge them, accept\nthem for who they are and to try to do anything and everything I can in my\npower to influence them to emerge to be better than that.\n\n**What advice would you give executives about building a strong company\nculture?**\n\n**Brown:  **An organization focuses first on its mission, and for us, it's\nexcellent client service. It's our relentless passion, focus, drive toward\nclient service that then builds our culture. You say, \"OK, here's our mission.\nWhat is it we need to ensure that we are doing together to create a culture\nthat will help us deliver on our mission?\"\n\n**Forman:** I would encourage leaders to do the work of finding out what are\ntheir values, crystallizing them and sharing them with their organization so\npeople know what to expect.\n\n____\n\nSupport real journalism.

More noticeably,\nthe salaries attached to these positions ranked 96 percent higher than the\nmedian wages for the rest of Texas, coming in at a median salary of $86,459.\nYeah, read that number again.\n\nCoding and UX/UI design bootcamps, like **[WeWork's Flatiron\nSchool](https://hubs.ly/H0jkY0Q0)** , assist Austinites in capitalizing on\nthese job opportunities and high salaries. These small, technical programs\nprepare people with little to no experience to land entry-level technical\nroles. Flatiron School, at WeWork's Westview location, specializes in training\nits students in software engineering and UX/UI design.\n\nKelsey, an online Flatiron School grad, first encountered code as a junior in\ncollege. Though interested, she didn't pursue programming because there\nweren't many women in her class. Lacking female role models in her coding\ncommunity, she switched directions to healthcare. After graduating from\nFlatiron, Kelsey landed a job as a technical support engineer at Pingboard Org\nChart Software in Austin. Now she enjoys building products and the opportunity\nto be the role model she needed years ago.\n\nKelsey's story, plus the many others from Flatiron School, illuminate the\nopportunity in Austin's growing tech workforce. With further growth predicted\nfor technical positions in Austin, entities like Flatiron School offer greater\naccessibility to 21st-century skills through a variety of offerings, including\nincome share agreements.\n\nLauren Bauml, campus director at Flatiron School Austin, explains: \"With the\nFlatiron School Income Share Agreement, we invest in your success and make\nyour career change more accessible.\"\n\nThe Flatiron School Income Share Agreement (ISA) aligns tuition payments with\npost-program income. If a student does not earn at least the minimum income\noutlined by the ISA, he or she does not pay tuition ([see\ndetails](https://hubs.ly/H0jkXZ90)).\n\nInterested in learning more about Flatiron School? Sign up for Flatiron\nSchool's [UX/UI design info session](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/uxui-design-\nimmersive-info-session-austin-tickets-62233721737?aff=CultureMapAustin) on\nJune 20 or its [software engineering info\nsession](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/software-engineering-immersive-info-\nsession-austin-tickets-62742467409?aff=CultureMapAustin) on June 26, both\nhosted at WeWork Westview in downtown Austin.\n\nFlatiron School is a global school that specializes in teaching tech skills\nlike software engineering, data science, and UX/UI design, both on campus and\nonline. Since 2012, Flatiron School has helped thousands of people change\ntheir careers and their lives by offering an alternative education model\nfocused on training people on the most in-demand tech skills of today, to\nprepare them for the jobs of tomorrow.\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\nRead These Next\n\n[ ![ATX_1906

Bill Boebel 4 minute Read\n\nA lot of my fellow tech CEOs attempt to [inspire employee\nengagement](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057445/3-reasons-why-employee-\nengagement-isnt-enough) by creating a [fun work\nenvironment](https://www.fastcompany.com/90227542/why-we-need-more-laughter-\nin-the-workplace). You know what I'm talking about: endless snacks, ping-pong\ntables, on-site gyms, and bike repair shops. Don't get me wrong-all of these\namenities are super neat-but I can't say that I've had an employee quit\nbecause no one filled the jar of Peanut Butter M&Ms for a couple of days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nUltimately, I've found that there are two things that employees _really_ care\nabout: their future and the company's future-in that order. The perks I\ndescribe above are just a bonus.\n\nThe thing is, [creating a great work environment takes time and\neffort](https://www.fastcompany.com/40506158/my-smartest-employees-have-\nforced-me-to-reward-them-heres-how). So if you're a CEO who wants to make your\nworkplace better, don't just buy your employees a ping-pong table. Ask these\nquestions:\n\n## 1\\. Does every single employee understand where the company is heading?\n\nC-suite leaders talk about the future of the company all the time. In fact,\nsometimes, we talk about it so much that we forget the rest of our workforce\nisn't privy to these discussions. According to\n[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/163196/getting-employee-\ncustomer-encounter.aspx), only 41% of employees understand their company's\noverall direction.\n\nThat's not high enough. _Every_ single employee in your organization should\nhave a clear view of where the company is heading and what objectives matter\nmost to the business. To help your your employees understand the future and\nvision of the company, do the following:\n\n  * Schedule a regular cadence of all-hands meetings to talk about the future, important objectives, significant changes, and (most importantly) why the company made the decisions they did or implemented those changes.\n  * Show employees how the company is structured and why. For this exercise, visual is best.\n  * Encourage collaboration and honesty by allowing employees to ask anonymous questions during all-hands meetings. You can have employees submit questions beforehand or use a forum-like tool where they can post comments and questions in real time.\n  * Repeat yourself. Marketing expert [Dr. Jeffrey Lant](https://www.drjeffreylant.com/) formulated the \"Rule of Seven,\" which states that messages don't resonate until they're repeated seven times over an 18-month period.\n  * Following the meeting, distribute a summary or slide deck to all employees.\n\n## 2\\. Do employees understand how their work contributes to larger\nobjectives?\n\nIt's not enough for employees to understand where the company is headed; they\nmust also know where their work fits in the bigger picture. Most people aren't\nsatisfied with clocking in, completing tasks, and clocking out. And according\nto a survey by Harris Interactive and Franklin Covey Co., [80% of workers have\nno clear line of sight between their tasks and organizational\ngoals](https://www.forbes.com/2007/03/19/covey-work-life-lead-careers-\nworklife07-cz_sc_0319covey.html#44a93560754d).\n\nMake sure your employees know that their work matters by ensuring that each\nperson on your team clearly understands the company vision and objectives. Set\ngoals with your team that align with them, and make sure to share your\nprogress along the way.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGive everyone access to a real-time org chart, and use this as a tool to\ncommunicate who is responsible for what and how they fit into the bigger\npicture of the organization. It's important to talk about this often,\nespecially when things change.\n\n## 3\\. Do my employees feel valued?\n\nEven after employees have a clear vision of the future and understand how\ntheir work contributes to overall objectives, you still need to manifest an\nenvironment where they feel engaged and motivated. A _Harvard Business Review_\nstudy revealed that [72% of respondents said that recognizing high performers\nhas a significant impact on employee engagement](http://talentsnapshot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/downloads/2017/04/Impact_of_Employee_Engagement_on_Performance.pdf).\n\nTo help your employees feel valued, train the managers in your company to give\nfeedback on one-on-one meetings with direct reports. Don't wait for quarterly\nperformance reviews to deliver praise or constructive criticism. If your\nfeedback is not so positive, make sure that it's specific and actionable. As\nmuch as you can, give them the tools and support to improve. Encourage your\nexecutives to stop and comment on an employee's work from time to time. A\nsmall comment from a member of the executive team can go a long way.\n\n## 4\\. Are you setting your employees up for a thriving future?\n\nA company can implement all of the tips above, yet an employee might still\nbecome disengaged. That's because, frequently, what matters most to the\nemployee is their own development and growth. This is why it's critical to\nunderstand what your employees care about. If you don't know the answers to\nthe questions below, start asking your employees about their goals and how you\ncan help them succeed-not only in their current position, but in future jobs\nas well. Here are the questions I ask my employees:\n\n  * \"What do you want to do after this job?\" I ask this as early as the job interview because it helps me understand the person's goals and if/how our company can help him or her achieve them\n  * \"What can I do right now to make progress towards the next step in your career?\"\n  * \"What training, workshops, or programs are you interested in?\"\n\nIt might be uncomfortable to discuss life after your company with your\nemployees. This is a conversation best handled one-on-one between manager and\nemployee, but make sure that this conversation starts between you and your\nexecutive team. Encourage your executives to have these types of talks with\ntheir direct reports, who should in turn discuss with their subordinates, and\nso on.\n\nYou will be surprised by what comes out of these conversations. Not only will\nyou and your employees be more on the same page, but they will be more engaged\nat work because they know you have their back when it comes to their long term\ncareer goals.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen leaders are communicative and transparent about the direction of the\ncompany, how the contributions of individual teams fit into the bigger\npicture, and how they can prepare employees for their next step, employees\nfeel valued, connected, engaged, and are much more likely to bring their best\nself to work.\n\n* * *\n\n _Bill Boebel is a serial entrepreneur and the CEO\nof[Pingboard-](https://pingboard.com)org chart software rebuilt for today's\nmodern workforce.

Oh, how times have changed! While there are more startups than ever,\nthere's also more money chasing them. In this series, we look at the new (or\nrelatively new) VCs in the early stages: seed and Series A.\n\nBut just who are these funds and venture capitalists that run them? What kinds\nof investments do they like making, and how do they see themselves in the VC\nlandscape?\n\nWe're highlighting key members of the community to find out.\n\n[Pat Matthews](/person/pat-matthews) is founder and CEO at Active Capital.\n\nBefore founding Active Capital, Matthews was a co-founder of Webmail.us, which\ngrew to $10 million in sales before being sold to Rackspace in 2007. He spent\nsix year at Racker and made dozens of startup investments as an angel\ninvestor.\n\n**VatorNews: What is your investment philosophy or methodology?**\n\n**Pat Matthews:** I'm really an entrepreneur turned investor. I live in Texas\nnow but I'm from Virginia, and I went to school at Virginia Tech during the\nheight of the dot-com boom. I got there in '95 and met some really smart,\nengineering-oriented friends and we ended up dropping out of school to chase\nour dot-com dreams. Of course, we launched our first business in March of 2000\nand the Nasdaq and the whole dot-com world crashed one month later. But we\nwere young and willing to keep iterating on the business, so we ultimately\npivoted from a consumer-facing dot-com to a business-facing enterprise\nsoftware company.\n\nWe made that transition over a couple of years and ended up building a B2B\nSaaS company for email hosting software. This was pre-Gmail, when businesses\nwere still running their own email servers, still having trouble with email\nreliability and getting email on mobile devices like Palm Pilots and all those\narchaic things. We really focused on becoming the best email hosting provider\nin the world, and we built a really valuable company. We got to $10 million in\nannual recurring revenue, and we ended up selling the business to Rackspace,\nwhich at the time was the perennial web hosting cloud and emerging cloud\ncomputing player in the space. My whole team and I joined, and I was an\nexecutive on the senior leadership at Rackspace for six years. I ran\neverything software-as-a-service and even the software side of hosting and all\nthe cloud-computing-oriented businesses. My entrepreneurial days were amazing\nbut my executive years at Rackspace were equally as amazing, and I got to see\na whole different scale of business. I had thousands of people in my\norganization and we were going up against Amazon; it was a very exciting time\non the internet with the cloud computing wars. We won some stuff, we lost some\nstuff, but it was awesome overall.\n\nUltimately, Rackspace became a big company and I ended up leaving at $1.5\nbillion in revenue. I went back to my roots of figuring out what I wanted to\ndo next and spending time in the startup world. Rackspace had given me such a\nlens into the startup world because, back then, every startup started at\nRackspace. Today, almost everyone starts at AWS, but back in the day you'd\nstart at Rackspace. I had a huge purview into the startup world even though I\nwas an executive in a big company, so I started angel investing. I angel\ninvested all over the place. I was not as focused as I am today, but I learned\na lot, built up a great portfolio and invested in a lot of great companies and\nfounders. I had a lot of fun but, more than anything, it shaped what I want to\ndo with the rest of life, which is what I'm doing now.\n\nAll of that has shaped what I'm doing today. Active Capital is a $20 million\nfund and we are designed to lead seed rounds for early-stage B2B SaaS\ncompanies. I decided to get the firm and the thesis focused on investing in\nthe types of companies that I've been a part of my whole career. That's where\nmy greatest strengths are, that's where I have the most credibility, that's\nwhere I'm able to have the most influence with the companies I invest in. More\nthan anything, I'm just spending the rest of my career focused on what I know\nbest.\n\n**VN: What are your categories of interest?**\n\n**PM:**  B2B SaaS is a very wide category, but I like that on purpose; I'm\nreally attracted to founders building amazing software businesses. I'm\nrelatively open to what problems they're trying to solve, so I don't focus on\nmarketing tech or government tech or whatever tech. All the basics that you'll\nhear from any VC--like, 'Is there a market for what they're doing? Is this the\nteam to build it?'--of course I look for that, but I really like to invest in\npure-play B2B SaaS companies. I invest in a stage where I want the founders to\nbe leading the company; it's such an instinctual stage of business, so I very\nmuch want to invest in founders.\n\nWe're pretty geographically agnostic as well. We haven't done anything outside\nof the U.S., but we've invested all over the U.S. and we look for\nopportunities where we can go in early and be the lead investor. We will\ninvest in very small pre-seed rounds, all the way up to larger $1 million to\n$1.5 million rounds. If the seed starts to become multiple millions of\ndollars, it ends up being too big for us, and that goes against the grain of\nhow I think seed rounds should go anyway, so we tend to check out of those. In\na nutshell, that's what we do and that's how it was all shaped.\n\nAnother thing is that, when I look back to the business I built and sold to\nRackspace, we never raised a lot of capital. Actually, that was one of our\nsaving graces because if we had raised millions and millions of dollars too\nearly, we would have died with every other dot-com. So, in many ways, the fact\nthat we didn't raise a bunch of money helped us avoid the young entrepreneur\npitfalls of scaling up a cost structure too quickly, and then, ultimately, if\nyou don't catch fire right away you pretty much burn out. So, I look for\nearly-stage companies that have made a lot of progress without a lot of\ncapital.\n\n**VN: What is the opportunity you see in the B2B SaaS space?**\n\n**PM:** I think there's opportunity everywhere. Every industry, every type of\ncompany out there, every workflow within every type of company is being\nreshaped by software today. I'm very happy to invest in software niches; at\nthe macro level we will invest in HR tech, marketing tech, sales tech. We'll\ninvest in all of these different categories, but I would double click on that\nand say we'll invest in founders that are going very deep in specific use\ncases within those categories.\n\nOne great example is a company in Austin called Pingboard. They're a B2B SaaS\ncompany at a high level; at the next level down, they're an HR tech company.\nThey are laser focused on building beautiful org charts for businesses. If you\nthink about every dynamic company out there, where the people landscape is\nchanging rapidly, they're always trying to map and visualize what the\norganization looks like today. Then they're also trying to figure out what the\norganization will look like in the future. Any executive today that's going to\na board meeting next week, who's trying to put together a lay of the land for\ntheir backyard, what do they do? They quickly pull out an old version of Visio\nor Excel or PowerPoint, and some of them will even draw it on paper. But\nPingboard makes it easy to map the entire organization and even drill down\ninto employee-level details, with a photo of the individual and what they do\nand what their previous jobs were. Then it provides leaders within the\ncompany, from the CEO to VPs to divisional managers to front line managers,\nthe ability to plan the future of their organizations as well.\n\nThey've got a lot of great traction, and some of the biggest logos in the\nworld are signing up with them every month. If you go to Workday or a lot of\nthese other multi-zillion dollar HR tech companies, they've all got some kind\nof org chart component, but they're all really bad. Pingboard has realized\nthat this is a great area that every business needs and they're going to drill\ndown and become the best in the world at it. I love that, and we've got a\nbunch of those kinds of companies.\n\n**VN: How many investments do you typically make in a year?**\n\n**PM:** We will end up with 15 to 20 core investments in the fund. When I say\ncore investment, we are designed to be the $500,000 check in the $1 million\nseed round. Then we save half about the fund to follow on with some of our\nwinners that go onto raise more money after that. Whether that's a second seed\nround or a Series A where we get to take our pro rata, we save about half the\nfund for opportunities that emerge out of the portfolio. We also take a small\nportion and we're willing to write really, really small checks into companies\nat the pre-seed level.\n\nIdeally, our hope is that most of the $500,000 checks we write are in\ncompanies that we have some kind of established relationship with because we\ninvested in them really early. So, while we will end up with 15 to 20 core\ndeals, where we write $500,000 checks or greater, we'll also end up with 15 to\n20 companies that we wrote much smaller checks into.\n\n**VN: What kind of traction does a startup need for you to invest? Do you have\nany specific numbers?**\n\n**PM:** I love companies that are doing $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue\nbut, more importantly, that are growing really fast. In fact, that makes the\n$25,000 number pretty flexible because what I would really look for is\ndemonstrated, repeated growth on a monthly basis. So, even if a company is\ndoing $12,000, but they went from $1,000 to $5,000 to $12,000, that will make\nme want to take a second look.\n\nPart of the deal is that, at such an early stage, you're really betting on the\nfounder's ability to connect with the market. That's how I think about it. To\nme, the market traction is the best indication of if they are able to do that,\nso I don't think the numbers need to get super big. I just want to see that\nthey're fast growing and beyond just signing up their network of friends.\nLike, if they went through TechStars, I want to see that it's more than all\nthe TechStars companies using it. I want to see a little bit beyond that, but\nI can invest in something small as long as it's growing.\n\n**VN: What other signals do you look for? Team, product, macro market?**\n\n**PM:** Building off what I said earlier about the team, I really like small\nteams that can make a lot of progress without a lot of capital. Sometimes\nsaying 'the team' means, do I like them? Do they have the right resume or\npedigree or whatever? To me, I want to know that I can work with them. They\ndon't necessarily have to be my best friends, but I want to know that I can\nwork with them and they have demonstrated their ability to get things done.\n\nReally, I want to see capital fuel investment in the business and not just\ninvest in a science project. I'm just not a science project guy; I want to\nhelp build companies and I think great companies produce amazing outcomes for\nshareholders, the founders, the community. So, I want to invest in companies.\nThat's who I am, that's what I've spent my entire career doing and I want to\nknow that they're going to be good stewards of the capital. I struggle with\ncompanies that raise tons and tons of money and put themselves on the venture\ncapital treadmill, and then they just can't make a lot of progress with it.\n\nI want to be able to understand the market. If everything goes right, can this\nbe a really successful outcome for the company, the founders, and us as the\ninvestors? Do I believe that the product matches with the market opportunity?\nI love founders that have really good product sense. Market, product, team,\ntraction, capital efficiency, those are the basics.\n\n**VN: What do you think about valuations these days? What's a typical Seed\npre-money valuation and Series A?**\n\n**PM:** I am valuation conscious. I don't know that I'm purely driven by\nvaluation, though, unless it feels like it's way outside of bounds.\n\nValuations have gotten crazy, but I feel like that is location specific. In\nSilicon Valley and San Francisco, valuations have gone through the roof, but I\ndon't necessarily feel like that's the case everywhere. So, instead of going\nto San Francisco and trying to find all the companies with the lowest\nvaluations, I spend time all across the country, and in cities across America,\ntrying to figure out who is doing what. The reality is that I find most\nvaluations outside the Valley to be somewhat reasonable. Every now and again I\nfind there to be outliers that I'm just not interested in.\n\nOne situation I see quite a bit, that I tend to stay away from, is when there\nis a previously successful founder that can then go into the market with a new\nconcept and a PowerPoint deck and raise a round at a big valuation. While I do\nrespect wisdom quite a bit, I tend to not invest in those. Those go against\nthe grain of what I like to do. I don't believe that valuations are super\ncrazy outside of the Valley, so I tend to stay away from the Valley and from\nthe exceptions to that.\n\n**VN: Does that mean that if a company had already raised money from Silicon\nValley, that would stop you from investing in them?**\n\n**PM:** Hundreds of companies are starting every day. I know that everybody\nwants to get on the next hot thing but, to me, if it doesn't feel right, I'm\nnot going to do it. You have to have some sort of thesis and fund strategy\nrelative to your fund size.\n\nHere's how I would look at it: company XYZ has all this Silicon Valley money,\nwhy do they need my money? Why do they need my $500,000? It doesn't mean I\nwouldn't co-invest in a round with a good Silicon Valley VC that I respect,\nbut, if a company has gone and raised $3 million in the Valley, and then, a\nyear later, they're trying to raise another bridge round or a second seed\nround, and all that money in the Valley doesn't want to pile in again, that\nsmells funny to me. I don't want to get caught with the adverse selection type\nof deals, and that's why I look for companies that are sort of new from the\nget-go and have not raised a ton of capital.\n\nIf a company has raised $2 million from wherever, Silicon Valley or anywhere,\nand let's say they grow and they're doing awesome and the revenue is off the\ncharts and everything is up and to the right, they don't need my $500,000\ncheck. The reality is I don't actually see that situation unless the company\nis struggling, and then my $500,000 wouldn't help them anyway.\n\n**VN: There are many venture funds out there today, how do you differentiate\nyourself to limited partners?**\n\n**PM:** There are a couple of things I would say about our firm. Number one,\nwe look mostly outside the Valley. For some people that's appealing, for some\npeople that's not, but I'm just a big believer, and a lot of this is shaped by\nmy own background, that some of the world's great companies are going to be\nbuilt far outside Silicon Valley over the next 10 or 20 years. In fact, I\nthink the majority of the world's great software companies are going to be\nbuilt outside the Valley. I don't even think that's a secret anymore; I even\nsaw Sam Altman the other day having a big tweet storm about how he basically\nagrees, which is totally new thinking coming from anybody who's in the Valley.\nSo, I look outside the Valley; I'm based outside the Valley. If you think\nabout all the seed funds that are out there today, you're looking outside of\nthe Valley and you're already heavily differentiated.\n\nNumber two, we are very focused on B2B SaaS, which is not just a random thing.\nSaaS is, I believe, the greatest business model in the world. We're very\nfocused on B2B and real businesses, but also it matches up with our\nbackground.\n\nThe third point is that we are entrepreneurs turned investors. So, a lot of my\nLPs like my story of walking in the shoes of the types of companies and\nfounders that we're trying to attract to the fund. In a world where a lot of\nVCs are fast talking, intimidating finance people, my background and approach\nis a little bit different and what I'm investing in very much aligns with what\nI have built in the past. We're trying to build a brand around this idea of\nActive Capital being backed by B2B entrepreneurs.\n\nAlso, the fact that we're designed to lead. Most seed funds out there are\nactually designed to follow and act like a super angel group more than\nanything. So, even though we're a small fund, we negotiate terms with the\nfounders, we're the ones that take the early board seats, I have a whole\nplaybook that I run with every company in our portfolio. I do monthly business\nreviews with them, I'm on text-message-level relationships and conversations\nwith them. As a former CEO, founder, entrepreneur and executive myself, all of\ntheir problems, challenges, and opportunities resonate with me, and they all\nbuy into the fact that I bring contextually relevant advice to the table. The\nmore that I can build trust with entrepreneurs who want to come to me with\ntheir problems and opportunities, the more that I can truly make small a\ndifference. Those are all the points that I like to walk my LPs through.\n\nGranted, I didn't raise any institutional money, I didn't raise any fund-to-\nfund money; almost all of my money is from founders and entrepreneurs and\nexecutives and people I've worked with over the years. The majority of people\nthat I raise money from are not getting pitched by venture capitalists every\nday. I have spent my entire career building companies in Virginia and Texas,\nso the networks that I built are not people that Sequoia are calling on every\nday or the next San Francisco, Homebrew-type of seed fund. My LPs are just not\nvery connected to those kinds of people, so they're not necessarily getting VC\npitches every day. So, my pitch to my investors was much more along the lines\nof, 'Hey, if you want exposure to this asset class, you should invest in a\nfund like mine, as opposed to making individual, direct deals yourself.' Most\nof my investors are the types of people who would just be angel investors\ninstead, more so than differentiating between Active Capital and Homebrew or\nInitialized Capital or one of those guys.\n\nOver time, I'm hopeful that I can attract some fund-to-funds or institutional\ntypes of investors, and the differentiation will become clearer to LPs. Our\nmessaging and differentiation are very clear to the entrepreneur, which is\nreally what I'm focused on at first. Then, ultimately, I want to build a\nsuccessful fund or two, and then the numbers will tell the story to more\ninstitutional investors. That's the strategy. But, if you're building a B2B\nSaaS company today, if you took a poll I think most B2B SaaS founders would\nrather raise early money from a B2B SaaS-focused fund, led by entrepreneurs\nthat have built highly successful B2B SaaS companies in the past, versus\neither getting it from a more institutional type fund, or, on the other end,\nraising it from 25 different angels investors. So, in our little corner of the\nworld, we have carved out a strategy that very much talks to the entrepreneur\nbuilding today's B2B SaaS company.\n\n**VN: Venture is a two-way street, and VCs have to sell themselves to\nentrepreneurs as well. How do you differentiate your fund to entrepreneurs?**\n\n**PM:** As you can imagine, I see deals of all types in the industry, but I'm\ntrying to brand Active Capital as the leading seed fund for B2B SaaS founders.\nI don't know anybody else doing that. I'm pretty familiar with many of the\nseed funds but if you are building a B2B SaaS company, especially if you're\noutside of Silicon Valley, I don't know how many other B2B SaaS-focused funds,\nrun by B2B SaaS-focused entrepreneurs, who have built great companies and had\ngreat outcomes, and are not just willing to invest outside of the Valley but\nprefer it, I just don't know how many of those there are. That set of\ningredients is highly differentiated.\n\n**VN: What are some of the investments you 've made that you're super excited\nabout? Why did you want to invest in those companies?**\n\n**PM** : There is a company called Altru, which is a New York City-based\ncompany. They have built a software platform that helps big companies humanize\ntheir employer brand. I love the founders; they're scrappy and really smart,\nthey went through TechStars. I like companies that spend the time and the\nfocus going through incubators; they don't always have to, but maybe half of\nour investments have.\n\nIf you think about big companies today, one of the biggest things that\ncompanies have to do is attract and retain great employees. Our country and\nour world are in a war for talent. If you think about how much money big\ncompanies spend building their core brand, and then how much they spend\nrecruiting for employees, it's gazillions of dollars going to these things.\nBut what a lot of companies don't spend a lot of time or money on is how they\nbuild their employee brand. How do they build a brand around what it's like to\nwork for their company? In fact, I would argue that the way that most people\nlearn about this is through third parties like Glassdoor and places where you\njust get hammered.\n\nSo, Altru has built a video-based Q&A platform so that companies can engage\ntheir everyday employees around what it's like to work at this company. They\ncan go really deep. It's a little bit like a video-based Quora for your\nemployees that gets exposed to the world. They're landing some of the biggest\ncompanies out there who are buying into this notion that we need to humanize\nand elevate what it's like to work at a company.\n\nThere's also a company in Kansas City that I really like, Super Dispatch. They\nhave built a software platform for carriers and brokers in the car hauling\nindustry. At a very macro level, they build trucking software, but they build\nit very specific to trucks that carry cars. It's very nichified, but very\npowerful software and a very successful company. I was introduced to Beck, the\nfounder, by another seed stage VC firm and so I got the intro from a trusted\nsource. When I met the founder, I immediately loved what he was doing; I love\nentrepreneurs that know how to focus just enough. There's a lot of money\npouring into everything automotive and trucking, both at the car level, the\nback-office-software level, the carrier and broker levels, but I really liked\nhow Super Dispatch was focused. I also love companies that are focused and\nreally dominating a niche, but you can start to imagine that, if everything\ngoes right, they can go beyond that niche as well, and I definitely feel that\nwith Super Dispatch.\n\nWhen I met them, they had bootstrapped the company to $50,000 a month in\nrevenue, and when I say bootstrapped, I mean they hadn't raised a dollar, so\nwe were the first money into the company. I like the founder, I can see myself\nworking with him, but I also felt like he was the guy with the credentials to\nbuild this company and I love the progress that he had made without raising\nany capital. So it really hits on most of the bullet points that I talked\nabout earlier.\n\nThere's a local company here in San Antonio called FunnelAI. They're one of\nthe fastest growing companies in our portfolio right now and what they do is\nhelp connect retailers with potential customers, based on their social\nactivity. When I say social, it's way beyond Facebook and Twitter. It's a\nreally cool company; they're using AI to help understand intent, and not just\nsomeone tweeting, 'I want to buy a car,' since that's pretty obvious. They are\nleveraging AI to get to the next level of intent with specific customers. One\nof the things I like about them is this is a company whose technology can\nultimately apply to several different industries, but today they are 100\npercent focused on the automotive retail industry, so basically car dealers.\nThey've gone an inch wide and a mile deep on this one category and the\ntraction and growth is incredible as a result. I love the founders. Also,\nthey're cash flow positive because they are growing faster than they're\nspending, which is crazy in tech. It's just a great company.\n\nAnother thing I'll say about the kind of companies I invest in, FunnelAI is an\n'AI company,' but I am not an investor in technologies. I'm an investor in\nproduct companies that apply technologies to solve a customer problem. It's\nnot that investing in technologies is a bad thing, but I'm just much more of\nan outcomes-based investor than a technology-based investor. I love the fact\nthat they're leveraging AI to get to this next level of customer intent that\nhappens to be really valuable to these retailers that want to connect with\nthem. But I'm not investing in them because AI is cool or hot or whatever.\n\n**VN: What are some lessons you learned?**\n\n**PM:** A big one is finding the right level of portfolio diversification in\nyour investing practices. A lot of people like to think they can pick the\nworld's next best company and, even when I look at my angel investment\nportfolio, some of my biggest winners are going to be my biggest surprises.\nBuilding a great business is hard, and not everybody is able to do it since\nmarkets change and dynamics happen. It's hard to find what the right level is,\nbut I'll tell you that when I went out to my potential investors to raise\nmoney for this fund, this was one of my big selling points that I really\nbelieved in. I don't think your average, high-network individual should be out\nthere in two, three, four early stage internet software companies. It's not a\nwinning strategy, so finding the right level of diversification is really\nimportant.\n\nFor me, focusing on what I know is really powerful. It doesn't mean that I\nwould make only bad investments in something I don't know but I'll tell you\nthat, through my angel days, I would do a lot of B2B stuff and I would do a\nlot of B2C as well. And I realized the deals I would get on the B2C side were\nnot as good. I was not viewed as being as credible as I am in the B2B world.\nThe best B2C entrepreneurs are not necessarily coming my way and also, when\ncompanies hit challenging times, I wasn't as able to influence them, either\nbecause I didn't have the right answers or I didn't have the right credibility\nwith the founders even if I had the answers. So, I'm just focusing on what I\nknow.\n\n**VN: What excites you the most about your position as VC?**\n\n**PM:** I love working with founders, I love helping founders create amazing\ncompanies. I also love helping coach founders and CEOs. There's a very big\ndifference between being able to get a company off the ground and truly being\nable to lead it over the long term, and founders need a lot of help getting\nfrom point A to point Z. Very few make the leap but the ones that do and can\nsuccessfully do it create the most valuable companies. There will be times\nwhen the founder is maybe not the one to run the company forever, but having\nthe founders have positive engagement in the company can also be something\nthat adds a lot of value and success to the business. So, for me, I love to\nwork with founders, I love working with creative people, I love leveraging my\nexperience to help them navigate the ebbs and flows of creating a company.\nThat's what drives me every day.\n\nI've seen it work well and I've seen great tech companies get built. Growth\ncompanies, especially in companies that are built right, can have such impact\non employees, on the founders, on the shareholders, on the communities, so I\nlove playing a small part in all that and helping the founder achieve their\nambition.\n\n[![Image\nDescription](https://vui.s3.amazonaws.com/2/110799.jpg)](/person/steven-loeb)\n\n####  [Steven Loeb](/person/steven-loeb)\n\n[All author posts](/news/contributors/steven-loeb)\n\n###  Read more from our \"Meet the VC\" series\n\nMarch 06, 2020\n\n##  [Meet Minette Navarrete, Vice-Chairman and President of Kickstart\nVentures](/news/2020-03-06-meet-minette-navarrete-vice-chairman-and-president-\nof-kickstart-ventures)\n\nKickstart Ventures is the corporate venture capital subsidiary of Globe\nTelecom\n\n[Read more...](/news/2020-03-06-meet-minette-navarrete-vice-chairman-and-\npresident-of-kickstart-ventures)\n\n  * [![Image Description](https://vui.s3.amazonaws.com/2/110799.jpg)](/person/steven-loeb) Steven Loeb \n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n\n##  [Meet Stephen Hays, founder of What If Ventures](/news/2020-01-27-meet-\nstephen-hays-founder-of-what-if-ventures)\n\nWhat If Ventures invests in startups focused on mental health and addiction\nrecovery\n\n[Read more...](/news/2020-01-27-meet-stephen-hays-founder-of-what-if-ventures)\n\n  * [![Image Description](https://vui.s3.amazonaws.com/2/110799.jpg)](/person/steven-loeb) Steven Loeb \n\nDecember 20, 2019\n\n##  [Meet Paul Asel, Managing Partner at NGP Capital](/news/2019-12-20-meet-\npaul-asel-managing-partner-at-ngp-capital)\n\nNGP Capital invests in growth-stage companies, with an initial check size of\n$10 million\n\n[Read more...](/news/2019-12-20-meet-paul-asel-managing-partner-at-ngp-\ncapital)\n\n  * [![Image Description](https://vui.s3.amazonaws.com/2/110799.jpg)](/person/steven-loeb) Steven Loeb \n\n[More episodes](/news/shows/meet_the_vc)\n\n### Related Companies, Investors, and Entrepreneurs\n\n![0?e=1556150400&v=beta&t=xhzl41a88ydgmqn-\nssfze-1clep6spaz6ti_9wjhlng](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGZsFu8WbU-\nEQ/profile-displayphoto-\nshrink_100_100/0?e=1556150400&v=beta&t=xhzl41a88ydgMQn-\nSSfze-1CleP6sPAz6TI_9WJHLNg)\n\n###  [Pat Matthews](/person/pat-matthews)\n\nJoined Vator on  February 19, 2019\n\n## Company\n\n  * [Events](https://events.vator.tv)\n  * [Contact Us](/contact_us)\n\n## For Organizations\n\n  * [VatorX](https://vator.tv/x)\n\n## For Fundraising\n\n  * [Vator Investment Club (VIC)](/VIC)\n\n2019 (C) All Rights Reserved.\n\n__\n\n"}, {"item": "A reprise of the dot-com bust looms, expert says, but Austin should escape unscathed - Austin Business Journal", "link": "https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2018/06/06/reprise-of-the-dot-com-bust-looms-expert-says.html", "guid": "CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9hdXN0aW4vbmV3cy8yMDE4LzA2LzA2L3JlcHJpc2Utb2YtdGhlLWRvdC1jb20tYnVzdC1sb29tcy1leHBlcnQtc2F5cy5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2F1c3Rpbi9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDYvMDYvcmVwcmlzZS1vZi10aGUtZG90LWNvbS1idXN0LWxvb21zLWV4cGVydC1zYXlzLmFtcC5odG1s", "pubdate": "Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2018/06/06/reprise-of-the-dot-com-bust-looms-expert-says.html\" target=\"_blank\">A reprise of the dot-com bust looms, expert says, but Austin should escape unscathed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Austin Business Journal</font>", "source": "Austin Business Journal", "body": "Request unsuccessful.

The signaling pathways that either turn\na cell\u2019s genes on or off are like wires laid out to the nucleus of the cell,\nsays Josh Mandel-Brehm, CEO of CAMP4 Therapeutics.\n\nCambridge, MA-based CAMP4 has developed technology to map out the \u201ccircuitry\u201d\nof the signaling pathways controlling the 20,000 genes in the human genome.\nMore than providing a picture of this circuitry, Mandel-Brehm says the\nstartup\u2019s software can help researchers understand how genes are regulated,\nwhich in turn might point the way to promising drug targets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sense of this circuitry by understanding which wires are\nswitched,\u201d says Mandel-Brehm, who worked in business development for Biogen\n(NASDAQ: [BIIB](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BIIB)) before joining CAMP4 last\nyear.\n\nCAMP4, which takes its name from the last camp before the summit of Mount\nEverest, now has $30 million in capital to expand its work and build\npartnerships with pharmaceutical companies. The Series A round was led by\nAndreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm that has backed tech\ngiants like Airbnb and Facebook (NASDAQ:\n[FB](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB)), as well as life sciences firms such as\nBioAge Labs and Freenome.\n\nCAMP4 was founded in 2016 based on the research of Richard Young of the\nWhitehead Institute at MIT, where he is a professor of biology, and Leonard\nZon, director of the stem cell program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and a\nprofessor at Harvard Medical School. Both Zon and Young have helped launch\nbiotech startups. Young is a co-founder of Syros Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:\n[SYRS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SYRS)), a Watertown, MA, company\ndeveloping [drugs based on the master switches that turn a cell\u2019s genes on and\noff](https://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/10/27/syros-raises-53m-more-to-push-\ngene-control-drugs-into-human-trials/). Zon is a scientific co-founder of\nCambridge-based Scholar Rock (NASDAQ:\n[SRRK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SRRK)), a company that develops [drugs\nthat target proteins called growth factors and either turn them on or keep\nthem switched off](https://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/01/02/scholar-rock-\naims-hit-disease-causing-proteins-niche/).\n\nMandel-Brehm says CAMP4 builds on the collaborative research of Young and Zon.\nHe says that the startup has gone further than those companies and others by\nmaking the understanding of how genes are turned on and off into a software\nplatform that is applicable to multiple genes in many different types of\ncells, Mandel-Brehm says.\n\n\u201cIf it works for one disease, it should work for other diseases as well,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nJorge Conde, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, says his firm looks for\ninvestments that have a technology process that is repeatable and scalable.\nThe firm also looks for products that can give insights into biology in ways\nthat were not possible before. \u201cThe story of what\u2019s happening inside a cell--\nthat\u2019s very powerful,\u201d Conde says.\n\nMandel-Brehm says CAMP4\u2019s research to date has focused on mapping the gene\ncircuitry of the liver and the disease genes that are associated with the\norgan. That information can be used to predict targets for potential drugs, he\nsays.\n\nWith the fresh capital, CAMP4 aims to expand its research to other types of\ncells besides those in the liver, Mandel-Brehm says. The company also plans to\nestablish partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies. Mandel-Brehm says\nCAMP4 is talking with companies interested in applying the startup\u2019s\ntechnology to their own library of compounds, or to drugs that have been\nshelved for various reasons. If these collaborations yield multiple drug\ncandidates, some of which a partner may not want to pursue, Mandel-Brehm said\nCAMP4 would be open to picking up those compounds for further development.\n\nJoining Andreessen Horowitz in the CAMP4 financing was Polaris Partners, the\nfirm that provided CAMP4\u2019s seed funding. The Kraft Group also participated in\nthe latest investment.\n\n _Photo of Mount Everest by Flickr user[Gunter\nHagleitner](https://flic.kr/p/c9Hz17) via a Creative Commons\n[license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)_\n\nFrank Vinluan is an Xconomy editor based in Research Triangle Park.

Inverness\nwill play host to the 17th edition of the Solheim Cup, pitting the best\nplayers from the United States against the best from Europe.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have Inverness host the 2021 Solheim Cup,\" said LPGA\nCommissioner Mike Whan. \"Inverness is one of the premier venues in golf and\nwill serve as a great test for a match-play competition. Additionally, Toledo\nhas been part of the LPGA family for over 30 years and we can't wait to see\nthe excitement, enthusiasm and hospitality that this great community will\nundoubtedly bring for the Solheim Cup.\"\n\nThe Donald Ross-designed Inverness Club boasts a major championship pedigree\nhaving hosted many of the premier championships in golf including four U.S.\nOpens (1920, 1931, 1957, 1979), two PGA Championships (1986, 1993) and, most\nrecently, the 2003 & 2011 U.S. Senior Open Championships.\n\n\"Inverness Club and its members are thrilled to have been selected to host the\n2021 Solheim Cup,\" said Inverness club president Steve Mitchell. \"Our historic\nDonald Ross-designed course has been host to six major championships and five\nnational championships and I'm especially proud that this tradition will now\nbe elevated to include the biggest event in women's golf.\"\n\nThe 2021 Solheim Cup will continue to build on the strong history and\ntradition of LPGA golf in Toledo, which began in 1954 at the Inverness Four-\nBall hosted at the Inverness Club. The Glass City has also played host to the\nMarathon Classic presented by Owens Corning and O-I since 1984, making it the\nsecond-longest running non-major tournament on the LPGA Tour.  \n\n\"I am extremely proud of northwest Ohio's effort to bring the Solheim Cup to\nInverness,\" said long time Marathon Classic tournament director Judd\nSilverman. \"The community has not only supported the LPGA for 32 years, but\nthey put together a compelling bid encompassing many exciting elements that\nultimately captured the LPGA's decision.  With all of the positive development\nthat is happening in Toledo presently and over the next few years I can't\nthink of a better time for our community to host such a prestigious\ninternational event like the Solheim Cup.\"  \n\nTournament officials today also announced Marathon Petroleum Corporation as\nthe third global partner for the 2021 Solheim Cup alongside PING and Rolex.\nMarathon has been the title sponsor of the LPGA's regular season stop in\nToledo since 2013.\n\n\"We're proud to support the 2021 Solheim Cup here in northwest Ohio where our\ncorporate roots are firmly planted,\" said Tom Kelley, Marathon Petroleum's\nsenior vice president of marketing. \"Along with our sponsorship of Stacy Lewis\nand title sponsorship of the Marathon Classic, being a global partner for this\nworld-renowned competition is a tremendous opportunity to extend our positive\nexperience with the LPGA.\"  \n\nMaking the announcement today in Toledo were U.S. Solheim Cup Team star Stacy\nLewis, PING Board Member Allan Solheim, LPGA Chief Commercial Officer Jon\nPodany and Tournament Chairman Richard Hylant.\n\n\"I think Inverness is going to be an unbelievable venue for us with all of the\nhistory with the guys playing there and just the history of the golf course\nitself,\" Lewis said. \"It's such a cool course to play with a bunch of holes\nreally close and I think it's going to help make for a very loud Solheim Cup.\"\n\nThe U.S. leads Europe 9-5 all-time in Solheim Cup competition following their\nhistoric comeback win in September at St. Leon-Rot Golf Club in Germany. The\nAmericans trailed 10-6 heading into Sunday's singles matches and overcame the\nlargest deficit in the event's history, winning 8 \u00bd points in the final\nsession. Team USA won by a score of 14\u00bd to 13\u00bd, the closest score in the\nhistory of the Cup.\n\nThe 2017 edition of the Solheim Cup will take place at Des Moines Country Club\nin West Des Moines, Iowa, August 14-20, 2017. The PGA Centenary Course at The\nGleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, will host the 2019 Solheim Cup.\n\n\ufeff\n\nComments\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * [
