startup looks to improve\npeople analytics capability across Southeast Asia.\n\nBy: [Shawn Liew](https://hrmasia.com/author/shawn-liew/ \"Posts by Shawn Liew\")\n| March 20, 2020\n\nTopics:

|\n[Singapore](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/singapore/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EngageRocket-Team.jpg)\n\nCompanies across Southeast Asia are increasingly utilising people analytics to\nmore effectively motivate and retain talented staff, observed Heang Chhor,\nmanaging partner of Qualgro.\n\nChhor was speaking after Qualgro led the transaction that saw Singapore-based\nEngageRocket, an employee experience solution, receive a S$3 million\ninvestment. Existing investors SeedPlus, Found. Ventures and JobsCentral co-\nfounder, Huang Shao Ning, were among those who increased their investment into\nEngageRocket. This brings the total funding raised by the company to S$4.5\nmillion.\n\nFounded in 2016, EngageRocket\u2019s product suite for employee engagement and\nperformance enhancement enables 50 active enterprise customers to make better\npeople decisions with real-time analytics.\n\nWith a recently opened Jakarta office adding to its Singapore HQ, EngageRocket\naims to triple its revenue in 2020 and double its headcount, specifically\nadding advanced capabilities in engineering, people science, as well as in\ncustomer-facing roles in each Southeast Asian market to deliver personalised\nsupport.\n\nLeong Chee Tung, co-founder and CEO of EngageRocket, said, \u201cAs the war for\nskilled talent intensifies in Asia, companies are starting to embrace an\napproach to talent analytics that\u2019s inspired by customer anlyatics.\nPersonalising the employee journey using real-time data can yield up to 147%\nimprovements in earnings per share, and 21% gains in per-person productivity.\u201d\n\nOver the past 12 months, EngageRocket has also doubled its user base and grew\nits enterprise customer segment by over four times. The cloud-based software\ncompany has analysed over two million employees\u2019 answers across 20 industries\nand 14 markets, from companies such as StarHub, Tokopedia, Mediacorp and\nSingapore Power.\n\nDorothy Yiu, co-founder and COO of EngageRocket, concluded, \u201cEngageRocket has\npartnered with our customers to build a culture of transparency and open\ncommunications that has helped them increase employee loyalty by over 400%,\nwhile equipping leaders at all levels with relevant insights to motivate and\nmanage their teams better.\u201d\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fengagerocket-\nraises-3-million-investment%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=EngageRocket+raises+%243+million+investment&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fengagerocket-\nraises-3-million-investment%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fengagerocket-\nraises-3-million-investment%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

2020\n\n  * **_Series A funding led by VC firm Qualgro, total investment at US$3.1mil_**\n  * **_Founded in 2016, company has since help analyse two million employees ' answers_**\n\n![EngageRocket cofounder and CEO Leong Chee Tung and cofounder and COO Dorothy\nYiu.](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/EngageRocket%20Cofounders.jpg)\n\nEmployee engagement and performance software provider EngageRocket announced a\nUS$2.1 million (SG$3 million) investment, which will be used to strengthen its\npresence in Southeast Asia (SEA).\n\nThe transaction was led by Singapore-based regional VC Qualgro, with existing\ninvestors SeedPlus, Found Ventures and JobsCentral cofounder Huang Shao-Ning\nparticipating as well. This brings the total funding raised by EngageRocket to\napprox. US$3.1 million (SG$4.5 million).\n\n**[SG$1 = US$0.70]**\n\nThis funding round follows a new office opening in Jakarta, in addition to\nEngageRocket's Singapore HQ. The company aims to triple its revenue by end\n2020 and double its headcount, specifically towards adding advanced\ncapabilities in engineering, people science and customer-facing roles.\n\nEngageRocket was founded in 2016 and provides a product suite for employee\nengagement and performance enhancement, which enables over 50 active\nenterprise customers to make better people decisions using real-time\nanalytics. Its platform lets HR leaders gain better visibility into their\norganisation's health and performance.\n\nThe company has since doubled its user base and grew its enterprise customer\nsegment by over four times in the past 12 months. As of now, the cloud-based\nsoftware company has analysed over two million employees' answers across 20\nindustries and 14 markets, including leading companies like StarHub,\nMediacorp, Tokopedia, and Singapore Power.\n\nIn 2017, the company raised SG$450,000 during their angel round, which was\nused to accelerate product development and scale operations to meet local\ndemand. This was followed by a US$640,000 seed funding round led by early-\nstage VC firm SeedPlus in 2018, meant to fuel expansion in Singapore and\nregionally, as well as expanding its product offerings.\n\nEngageRocket's cofounder and COO Dorothy Yiu says:  \"EngageRocket has\npartnered with our customers to build a culture of transparency and open\ncommunications that has helped them increase employee loyalty by over 400%\nwhile equipping leaders at all levels with relevant insights to motivate and\nmanage their teams better.\"\n\n\"As the war for skilled talent intensifies in Asia, companies are starting to\nembrace an approach to talent analytics that's inspired by customer analytics.\nPersonalising the employee journey using real-time data can yield up to 147%\nimprovements in earnings per share, and 21% gains in per-person productivity,\"\nclaims EngageRocket cofounder and CEO Leong Chee Tung.  \n\n\n\n**_Related stories:_**\n\n**_[Singapore's

to this article\n\nFRESH from raising S$3 million in a Series A round, human-resources (HR) tech\nstartup EngageRocket is expanding in Indonesia and eyeing Thailand, Malaysia\nand The Philippines as potential markets, its co-founder and chief executive\nLeong Chee Tung told _The Business Times_.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, EngageRocket announced that its Series A raise was led by\nregional venture firm Qualgro and joined by existing investors SeedPlus,\nFound.Ventures and angel investor Huang Shao-Ning, the co-founder of\nJobsCentral. In total, the startup has raised S$4.5 million to date.\n\n\u201cWe want to deepen our presence and serve the local cultural needs of the\nmarkets in a better way. We need to stay innovative and venture out\u2026 We are\nalso keeping an eye out on Vietnam as a talent base; it\u2019s an up-and-coming\nmarket,\u201d Mr Leong said.\n\nThe expansion comes as EngageRocket is seeking to triple its revenue this\nyear, while doubling its existing headcount of about 20. Mr Leong declined to\nshare specific figures on the startup's revenue.

skills, perspectives and\nexpectations, how can employers manage and engage them?\n\nBy: [Daniel Teo](https://hrmasia.com/author/daniel/ \"Posts by Daniel Teo\") |\nMarch 17, 2020\n\nTopics:

[Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/27992406_m.jpg)\n\nWe are witnessing a diverse and dynamic workforce today, with four generations\nof different skills, expectations and perspectives that employers have to\nmanage and engage with.\n\nOn the one hand, millennials (1981-1996) and Gen Z (1997-2010) are bringing a\nwhole new set of expectations to the workplace. And on the other hand, Gen X\n(1965-1980) and Baby Boomers (1946-1964) are retiring in large numbers.\n\nOver the last few years, millennials have rapidly risen to the peak of their\ncareers and occupying leadership positions in the workforce. Meanwhile, the\nGen Zers are beginning to enter the workforce with a whole new mindset and\npurpose of work. The Gen Xers face the danger of being left behind in the\ndigital age if they are unable to upskill themselves and stay relevant. And\nphasing out of the workforce are the baby boomers who are seeing out the final\nphase of their careers.\n\nSo how do employers manage and engage four generations with such diverse\nskills, perspectives and expectations? First, let\u2019s dive deeper into each\ngeneration of workers to find out what their concerns and expectations are.\n\n**Gen Z**\n\nWhile employers have focused on their efforts and engagement on the millennial\nworkforce, they must start gearing up for the next wave of employees \u2013 the Gen\nZers. And if they think that the Gen Zers and millennials are the same breed,\nthey might want to think again.\n\nThe State of Employee Engagement in 2020 study by EngageRocket found out that\nGen Z employees are two to three times more likely to find their\nrewards/compensation at work to be unfairly distributed, compared to other\ngenerations. In fact, only 11% of those surveyed indicated that they strongly\nagree that they are fairly rewarded for their contributions to the\norganisation. Having said that, they are the most engaged out of the four\ngenerations. The study also found they will value having an employer which is\nable to provide mentorship and continuous learning. They also expect their\ncompany to be socially responsible with strong and shared values.\n\n**Millennials**\n\nBy 2025, millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce. And despite\nemployers focusing on changing their strategies to adapt to the millennial\nworkforce, more needs to be done to engage and recognize this generation of\nemployees.\n\nOnly 16% of millennials strongly agree that they received recognition for\ntheir contribution to the organization while 19% strongly believe their work\ngive them a sense of accomplishment. And only half of them are satisfied with\nthe performance review at their organization.\n\nSince reward and recognition are the main concerns of millennial employees,\nemployers should look into cultivating a culture of recognising excellence and\nimplementing a deliberate, well-constructed performance review program.\n\n**Gen X**\n\nThe oldest members of Gen X are nearing the 60+ years milestone and are fast\napproaching the time of retirement while the younger ones are expected to\ndevelop their career for another 22 years or more. Companies that ignore this\npotential will lose out on a vital opportunity.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a need for upskilling, companies can find their biggest\nsupporters in Gen Xers, with 71% of them believing in their organisations\u2019\nmission or purpose. Yet, only 14% of them strongly feel that they are fairly\nrewarded for their contribution to the organization and 11% agree that they\nhave the freedom to express their views even though they might contradict the\nviews of their superiors. Therefore, employers need to develop initiatives to\nencourage autonomy and by implement effective recognition strategies if they\nwere to maximise the potential of their Gen X talent.\n\n**Baby Boomers**\n\nWhile many of them have already retired, those that are in the final stage of\ntheir careers can be valuable assets for companies through their experience\nand leadership skills. But they first need to know they are being valued and\nheard. Even though most of them (72%) still find meaning in their work, only\n16% of baby boomers indicated they are strongly confident that they can\ninitiate change when they perceive a smarter way of doing things while 18%\nstrongly feel that their development is encouraged at work.\n\nTherefore, enabling the requisite autonomy, combined with upskilling designed\nfor the digital era, is essential to maintain their level of engagement and\nproductivity.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\ndo-employers-manage-a-multi-generation-workforce%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+do+employers+manage+a+multi-\ngeneration+workforce%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-do-employers-\nmanage-a-multi-generation-workforce%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\ndo-employers-manage-a-multi-generation-workforce%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

The company also experienced triple growth in\nthe number of its employees in just three years. To date, more than 4,200\nNakama (Tokopedia\u2019s employees) work at Tokopedia.

We needed a solution for measuring\nand confirming that all of our Nakama remains aligned with Tokopedia\u2019s\nmission. Through this renewed partnership with EngageRocket, we are maximizing\nthe strength of or HR data as a basis for improving HR processes and systems\nto provide a better experience for all Nakama.\u201d\n\n_**HR News:**_[Jennifer Du Toit Appointed by Buck as National Health Practice\nStrategic Consultant and Member of Its Us Leadership\nTeam](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/leadership-succession/jennifer-du-\ntoit-appointed-by-buck-as-national-health-practice-strategic-consultant-and-\nmember-of-its-us-leadership-team/)\n\nThe EngageRocket Belong module enables Tokopedia\u2019s People teams to run\nautomated pulse surveys called \"The Voice of Nakama\" to easily collect data on\nemployee engagement and \"3 DNA Pulse Check\" to monitor the implementation of 3\nDNA (corporate culture) in each work team. This data is centralized and\nanalyzed in a single platform to allow the People team and leaders or managers\nto gain a better understanding of Nakama and their team's conditions and\nprovide feedback and improvements for better HR management.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to help Tokopedia scale their unique culture and help them build\nmemorable experiences for employees in this rapid growth journey,\u201d said\nDorothy Yiu, co-founder at EngageRocket. \u201cUsing real-time people analytics to\nmeasure the health of the organization is the best way to prevent\ndisengagement.\u201d\n\nEngageRocket\u2019s solution provides a solution accessible for all employees\nthrough multiple channels supported by strong analytical and reporting\ncapabilities. Data reconciliation with other HRSI such as Workday, user-\nfriendly dashboard, and customizable reports also provides insights to the\nPeople team and leaders or managers with actionable insights in real-time.\n\nSpecifically, with the EngageRocket Growth module, every Nakama can provide\nperformance feedback to the team, coworkers, and leaders so that the priority\nof learning and development in Nakama can be monitored regularly.

Other investors from [the previous\nround](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-based-hr-tech-startup-\nengagerocket-raises-s450k/) include former JobCentral co-founder Huang Shao-\nNing.\n\n\"I\u2019m most excited about the application of data and technology to solve\nproblems at scale. In Asia, there exist huge gaps in understanding human\ncapital and relevant data to enable people managers and leaders to build\nbetter companies,\" said Tiang Lim Foo, operating partner at SeedPlus.\n\nEngageRocket is co-founded by Dorothy Yiu and Leong CheeTung who are former\nregional heads at American research and consulting company Gallup.\n\nIn the last 12 months, the company has expanded to analysing data from 13\ncountries in Asia Pacific. This region is seeing the fastest growth in the\npeople analytics market at almost 20% annually, driving a market that is\ntipped to reach US$1.87 billion by 2025 which was almost non-existent just 10\nyears ago.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [The impact of AI on workers in ASEAN\u2019s six largest\neconomies](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-impact-of-ai-on-workers-\nin-aseans-six-largest-economies/)\n\n\"We spend more than half our waking lives at work,\u201d Leong, co-founder and CEO,\nsaid. \"Asian companies employ 60% of the global labour force today, and will\ncontribute 40% of global GDP by 2030.

EngageRocket)\n\nPermalink: http://str.sg/4ugZ Copy\n\n## The fast-emerging human resources (HR) technology field is booming, with a\nmarket for tools that enable management to gather feedback from staff . Last\nyear, the market for feedback tools was reported to be worth $300 million, and\nis doubling in size annually. Home-grown firm EngageRocket is one such\nemployee engagement platform. It closed a funding round of $450,000 in April,\nand is the first start-up in South-east Asia to receive funding for using\nadvanced analytical techniques in the traditionally conservative field of HR.\nSabrina Theseira speaks to EngageRocket co-founder and chief executive Leong\nChee Tung.\n\n[Sabrina Theseira](/authors/sabrina-theseira)\n\n[tsabrina@sph.com.sg](mailto:tsabrina@sph.com.sg \"tsabrina@sph.com.sg\")\n\n#### Q What is EngageRocket and how does it work?\n\n**A** EngageRocket is a cloud-based software that analyses employee feedback\nin real time, to advise leaders on how to build a better workplace culture.\n\nManagers can start by logging on to engagerocket.co and creating an account on\nthe Web application. They enter the number of employees in their team and\nchoose the duration of the plan.\n\nA survey is then set up, where managers can choose from 27 validated questions\nfor employee engagement provided by EngageRocket. They can also choose to\nadjust the questions or customise their own.\n\nA launch date is set and the survey is sent out to employees.\n\nReminders are sent out to employees throughout the survey period. At the end\nof the survey, our own algorithms will churn out the data and present it on a\ndashboard.\n\nManagers are then given customised suggestions as to how they can improve\ntheir leadership style based on the feedback given.\n\n> RESPONSIVE\n>\n> **With the survey results being displayed in real time, management action\n> often follows quite quickly. This makes employees feel as though they have a\n> voice and inspires them to give more feedback.''**\n>\n> ENGAGEROCKET CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE LEONG CHEE TUNG\n\n#### Q When did you start EngageRocket and what inspired you?\n\n**A** It was started in July last year, but the conceptualisation and testing\nof ideas began in early 2016.\n\nI was previously working as the South-east Asia director for Gallup, an United\nStates-based consulting company.\n\nHowever, the big players like Gallup often served larger firms with more than\n2,000 employees.\n\nMy co-founder and I realised that there was a demand among smaller companies\nfor such services as well.\n\nHowever, small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have the financial\nresources, manpower or time to maintain such a programme. Everyone ends up\ndonning multiple hats.\n\nThrough EngageRocket, we wanted to make HR analytics more accessible to SMEs\nat a fraction of the cost of hiring traditional consultants. It barely takes\nfive minutes a month to implement employee feedback programmes, as compared to\nweeks if you were to do it using typical manpower.\n\n#### Q How is EngageRocket different from similar types of technology\navailable in the market?\n\n**A** Although there are free survey tools in the market, it is very difficult\nto check participants accurately and analyse the data.\n\nOften, with free tools, there are missing fields and a misalignment of roles,\nleading to the wrong picture being presented to the management.\n\nFurthermore, leaders are presented only with data sets, which they have to\nanalyse themselves.\n\nThis is a very time-consuming process and hinders leaders from devoting their\ntime to more meaningful tasks.\n\nFree surveys, without specific domain expertise, may also ask the wrong\nquestions, leading to irrelevant data.\n\nEngageRocket puts in a lot of effort into validating our questions locally.\nFor example, we sent out our questions to employees working in Asian companies\nto test for consistency of interpretation and understanding.\n\nThis ensures that the questions asked are relevant and add value to our local\nfirms.\n\n#### Q Given that the advice given to leaders is generated by algorithms, how\ndo you ensure that it is unique and relevant to the changing global landscape?\n\n**A** With EngageRocket, we are not removing the need for a team manager, but\nrather supporting his actions on a regular basis.\n\nIn terms of data uniqueness, every single manager has his own strengths and\nopportunities for development.\n\nThe system enables the manager to see in quantitative detail what those\nstrengths and weaknesses are and pinpoints opportunities for improvement.\n\nThe insights given will be different based on the set of problems every\nmanager faces.\n\nWith regard to relevancy, the longer we work with each company, the more data\non that company we have.\n\nThus, our system is all the more able to tailor the responses to each\nindividual manager.\n\nWe are constantly sourcing out new solutions and interviewing current and\nprospective clients to see what their needs are.\n\n#### Q How has EngageRocket been received so far?\n\n**A** I would say it has been received warmly by both firms and employees. We\nhave had more than 50 companies take up EngageRocket so far, such as GIC and\nSephora Asia-Pacific.\n\nSome of our clients tell us that their administrative overheads have been\nreduced by more than 80 per cent.\n\nBy making our surveys approachable, we are also seeing employee participation\nrates of more than 85 per cent.\n\nWith the survey results being displayed in real time, management action often\nfollows quite quickly.\n\nThis makes employees feel as though they have a voice and inspires them to\ngive more feedback.\n\nOne of our clients even has a weekly meeting in which they take 10 minutes to\ntalk about issues brought up through EngageRocket surveys.\n\nLooking for areas for improvement becomes a habit and this habit is what\nultimately drives change.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non May 23, 2017, with the headline '5 questions with...

The\nglobal labour crunch is one that seems to affect every industry; and according\nto a 2018 study by Korn Ferry, 20 major economies will feel its effect in the\nnext decade or so. A worldwide talent deficit of 85.2 million workers \u2013 larger\nthan Germany\u2019s current population \u2013 will hit these economies by 2030; and the\nglobal skills shortage could translate to US$8.45 trillion in unrealised\nannual revenue \u2013 equivalent to the combined gross domestic product of Germany\nand Japan.\n\nWith our country\u2019s birth rate slipping over the past decades, Singapore will\nnot be spared as the number of adults entering the workforce declines.\n\nKorn Ferry\u2019s study estimates that by 2030, we will be short of more than one\nmillion skilled workers \u2013 and that figure will translate into revenue losses\nof US$106.8 billion annually. Businesses might be forced to put growth plans\non hold with such a grim outlook as the talent gap widens.\n\nThe roles in human resources (HR) departments will also become increasingly\ndemanding as it has to do more than just manage staff records, payroll and\nleave; and the main challenges include attracting potential talent, as well as\nretaining new and old employees.\n\nNot only that, millennials are starting to climb the managerial ladder, while\nthe first batch of Generation Z begin entering the job market. Hence, a change\nin work culture and office dynamics are inevitable; and to say that HR has its\nwork cut out would be an understatement.\n\nThis is especially since the 2018 Millennial Survey by Deloitte found that 43\nper cent of millennials plan to quit their current job within two years and\nonly 28 per cent could see themselves staying in their current role for more\nthan five years. The survey was conducted in 36 countries, with 10,455\nmillennials and 1,844 Gen Z-ers taking part in it.\n\nTraditional HR methods such as using yearly appraisals to evaluate employees\nare fast becoming outdated as the need to keep a pulse of the workplace\nbecomes more urgent than ever. Hence, it is not uncommon to find companies\nturning to technology to cope with this sea change.\n\n**DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTION**\n\nUsing people analytics to know what employees want and to reduce turnover\nrates is becoming more widespread. During the HR Festival Asia conference in\nMay, Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad noted that HR technology is\nbecoming more accessible and affordable. He added that the field has grown to\nbecome a US$400 billion industry worldwide, and about 200 HR tech firms in\nSingapore have received about US$1.4 billion of funding from private\ninvestors.\n\nEngageRocket is one such fast-growing homegrown people analytics solution\nprovider that helps companies make better people decisions by using real-time\ndata. Founded in 2016 by Dorothy Yiu and Leong Chee Tung, who were formerly\nregional heads at American research and consulting company Gallup, it now\nserves more than 30,000 users in\n\n13 Asia-Pacific markets, across 20 industries which includes companies such as\nSephora, Thales, Novartis and Tokopedia.\n\n\u201cEngageRocket is simple to use, provides real-time actionable insights backed\nby research and can be deployed and scaled quickly within an organisation,\u201d\nsays Mr Leong. SMEs, especially, stand to benefit because EngageRocket\u2019s\nsolutions come \u201cat a fraction of the cost of hiring traditional consultants\u201d.\nIt generates revenue via a time-based subscription model, and the cost\nstructure depends on the size of the company or the team that is using\nEngageRocket\u2019s solutions.\n\nThe endgame is to level up HR capabilities and create better employee\nexperiences using real-time people analytics. \u201c(Previously) we found it was\nchallenging for HR to collect accurate employee engagement data and identify\nactionable insights in a timely and effective manner \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a good way\nfor leaders to get reliable data on each stage of the employee experience in a\nsingle place,\u201d explains Mr Leong.\n\nEngageRocket collects information through automated engagement surveys, 360\nreviews and demographic analytics from on-boarding to separation; and its\nplatform will instantly analyse and translate feedback into actionable\ninsights. This in turn will empower HR managers to make data-driven decisions,\nrectify HR programmes that are not working and find out if an individual\nmanager\u2019s leadership style is generating the desired effect on his or her\nteam.\n\n**THE CASE FOR GOING DIGITAL**\n\nThe need for continuous listening is essential. Online retailer Amazon\u2019s\nConnections programme, for instance, sends daily surveys with different\nquestions to different segments of its 566,000 employee base globally.\n\nIt might be a little extreme but Mr Leong points out that studies have shown\nthat the return on investment on people analytics can be as high as US$13 for\nevery US$1 spent: \u201cPutting data from across the employee lifecycle through\ncontinuous listening channels can clearly yield powerful talent insight.\nWhether this is a simple matter of slapping together the relevant charts on a\nsingle dashboard or having a more scientifically robust way of normalising the\ndata across stages, establishing a single source of truth for employee\nexperience data is the first step towards strategically managing the employee\nlife cycle.\u201d\n\nBecause the process is automated, businesses do not have to commit a large HR\nunit or hire an analytics team to administer and collate data and insights, he\nadds. \u201cOur solution gives leaders the ability and time to focus on areas of\nimprovement and to personalise their management style in the best way to\nimprove employee motivation \u2013 we allow HR and leaders to build better\nworkplaces by removing unnecessary complexity while preserving employees\u2019\nconfidentiality.\u201d\n\nHe adds that unhappy or \u201cdisengaged employees\u201d are red flagged by their lack\nof response to survey questions, as well as their behaviour interacting with\nEngageRocket\u2019s platform. \u201cFor example, by analysing our customers\u2019 results, we\nfound that a low survey participation rate indicates a warning signal for\nupcoming talent attrition \u2013 non-respondents in that study had a 2.7x higher\nlikelihood of leaving the company within six months,\u201d Mr Leong explains.\n\n**COMBINING DATA SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**\n\nPulsifi is another homegrown Big Data HR startup that seeks to discover and\nrealise the potential of job candidates and employees in the workplace by\nusing artificial intelligence (AI). The company, founded by Peter Yoong and\nJay Huang in 2016, secured US$1.1 million in funding from three angel\ninvestors last August to enhance its people analytics platform.\n\nThe two have over four decades of working experience between them, and know\nfirst-hand that the single biggest challenge that any company faces lies in\nfinding and developing great people. \u201cGreat people are the key to bringing any\norganisation to greater success,\u201d says Mr Huang, who is also Pulsifi\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cOn the other hand, we saw that so few of the people around us actually looked\nforward to starting the work week on Mondays \u2013 and so much of their lifetime\nis spent at work! \u2013 (so) if their people are not motivated, organisations will\nnot achieve their success.\u201d\n\nAs the founders themselves used to work in digital marketing \u2013 an industry\nthat already heavily uses data points to map out consumer preferences \u2013\nPulsifi decided to apply a similar approach to HR. The company\u2019s solution is a\ncloud-based people analytics software platform that combines organisational\npsychology and data science into AI that predicts the suitability of people to\na role, team and organisation. \u201cPulsifi is unique in two aspects \u2013 firstly, we\nuse multiple data sources to holistically describe both the hard skills and\nsoft traits of each person,\u201d Mr Huang shares. \u201cOur AI gathers information\nabout candidates and employees from CVs, psychometric assessments, video\ninterviews, social media, etc.\u201d\n\nAlgorithms designed by Pulsifi\u2019s people science team \u2013 comprising data science\nand organisational psychology experts and PhD holders \u2013 then use the data to\nunderstand hard skills and soft traits \u2013 such as competencies, personality,\nwork interests and work culture \u2013 and reveal predicted behaviours and\nattitudes of people, such as motivation to learn, grit and teamwork.\n\nThis holistic insight presented is something that is not possible from just\nlooking at one\u2019s LinkedIn account or even through an interview; and the data\nis explained to the client rather than just looked at blindly.\n\nMr Huang adds that Pulsifi\u2019s other uniqueness lies in how it tailors\nalgorithms for each organisation: \u201cWe partner organisations to benchmark their\nemployees \u2013 analysing employee performance, engagement and retention data, and\ndetermining the specific hard skills and soft traits that predict success in\neach role in the organisation.\u201d\n\n**SUCCESS RATE**\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and Pulsifi says that it has delivered \u201con\naverage over 100 per cent improvement in candidate selection quality and over\n70 per cent improvement in operational efficiency \u2013 as well as succession\nplanning, internal mobility, teaming, and learning and development\u201d to its\nclients which include Nestl\u00e9 and Reckitt Benckiser.\n\nSimilarly, Singapore\u2019s largest home-grown women\u2019s fashion brand Love, Bonito\nhas adopted EngageRocket\u2019s solution as the company wanted a cost- effective\nand intuitive way to scale quickly. Its workforce grew by 50 per cent last\nyear with the headcount now standing at 150. That number is set to increase by\nthe same increment by the end of 2019.\n\nLove, Bonito also aims to align customer and employee experience using data.\nBrandon Lee, head of People & Culture (P&C) at Love, Bonito shares: \u201cWe\nstrongly believe our employees\u2019 experience should reflect the one we are\ntrying to provide to our customers. We are investing time, effort and money\ntrying to understand our customers, measuring their satisfaction and\npersonalising their journey \u2013 it\u2019s only right that we want the same for our\n(employees).\u201d Adopting HR tech also allows Love, Bonito to keep operations\nlean and is \u201cone initiative in a greater push towards open feedback and omni-\nchannel communication within the organisation\u201d, he adds. In this way, the\ncompany hopes to crowdsource feedback, suggestions and ideas for policy-making\nand company-wide initiatives.\n\n\u201cHaving a lean P&C team means that we have to place bets and roll out\ninitiatives that are most relevant \u2013 having consistent employee feedback means\nwe don\u2019t have to place bets blindfolded,\u201d explains Mr Lee.\n\n**STILL HUMAN**\n\nContrary to those who fear that digitisation equals robots taking over jobs,\nthe use of HR technology is anything but that. Pulsifi\u2019s Mr Huang clarifies:\n\u201cWe help to put the \u2018human\u2019 back in \u2018human resources\u2019 (and) help HR do what\nthey really want to do better.\u201d\n\nHe adds that HR managers will spend much less time on repetitive tasks such as\nscreening job applicants and candidates, or compiling candidate profiles from\ndisparate data sources with Pulsifi\u2019s AI.\n\n\u201cThey (will) have much more time to invest in areas where the human touch is\nvaluable, such as convincing candidates to join the organisation, coaching\nemployees for learning and development, and strategic people planning for the\norganisation.\u201d The technology has also improved leaps and bounds since Google,\none of the pioneers in people analytics, tested it as Projected Oxygen a\ndecade ago.\n\nAlthough EngageRocket\u2019s Mr Leong admits that it is still a \u201crelatively nascent\nfield in Asia\u201d, the company is excited to be at the forefront. \u201cNew\nmethodologies and tools have proliferated with Web and mobile applications\noperating in a far more agile and responsive infrastructure,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that with continuous listening systems maturing, and data\nflows between silos become more flexible, it is very likely that HR will\nrapidly transition across the value chain from descriptive to diagnostic to\npredictive and eventually prescriptive analytics within the next few years.\u201d\n\nPulsifi\u2019s Mr Huang says that he is encouraged to see organisations moving\nhiring criteria away from just scanning a jobseeker\u2019s CV and relying on gut\nfeel which could not only lead to bias and unfairness but also limit the\npotential of the hire. \u201cWe see this as a sign that (they) are keen to\nunderstand people more holistically, and hire people for the traits that lead\nto success in their roles . . . after all, prior roles, education and grades\nare seldom the only contributors to success in jobs,\u201d he notes.\n\nHe goes as far as to predict that the future of any industry lies in analytics\nand data. \u201cTechnology has become so integral in every part of our lives today\nthat we seldom call it out as technology anymore; (and) in the near future, we\nwould similarly not be calling analytics out anymore.\u201d\n\n**ACTIVITY-BASED WORKING**\n\nBut going the high-tech route is not the only way that HR is coping with the\nfuture of work. As early as 1989, Erik Veldhoen popularised the concept of\nactivity-based working (ABW). His integrated consultancy firm Veldhoen +\nCompany opened its sixth office \u2013 and the first in Asia \u2013 in Singapore two\nyears ago to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving business landscape and\nemployee needs in the region.\n\nGoing against the typical nine-to-five office culture, ABW is based on the\nphilosophy that people should be trusted and empowered to work anytime\nanywhere in order to do their best work. It goes beyond just hot desking or\ndesigning an open concept office \u2013 ABW is a business strategy that re-\nimagines traditional practices to engage people at the workplace and gives\nemployees the freedom of choice to decide how he or she works to achieve the\nbest outcome. In short, it transforms work into something that you feel\nempowered to do, rather than somewhere you need to be.\n\nManaging partner (South-east Asia and Japan) of Veldhoen + Company Iolanda\nMeehan, who is heading the new Singapore office, says that the role of HR is\n\u201ccrucial\u201d in ABW and it needs to be at the table when the discussions are\nhappening to support employees through the transformation. More importantly,\nHR professionals must not see ABW as merely a real estate project or feel that\nthey are to police things, she says.\n\n\u201cIn ABW, a culture of feedback is very important, so the HR team doesn\u2019t\nbecome the enforcers of ABW but rather the facilitators of transformation . .\n. If carried out properly, an ABW transformation is fully co-created with\nemployees, every step of the way,\u201d Ms Meehan stresses.\n\nSennheiser\u2019s Singapore office recently integrated ABW in its new office in a\nbid to encourage a team-oriented approach towards working. Martin Low,\nmanaging director at Sennheiser Electronic Asia, says: \u201cIt drives home the\ntransition from a \u2018me\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019 mentality at work, which encourages trust among\ncolleagues while fostering camaraderie.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the intelligent use of natural lighting complimented with\ntechnological innovation, for instance, has given rise to energy levels around\nthe office as greater collaboration and communication now take place daily. He\nalso notes that the removal of silos has also radically transformed working\nstyles and brainstorming sessions \u2013 and even Sennheiser\u2019s customers do not\nmind staying on a little longer for discussions.\n\nThe journey involved a close collaboration between HR, business, IT and real\nestate, according to Ms Meehan. \u201cSince the changes were not mainly about the\nenvironment but around driving a more interactive and empowered behaviour, HR\nplayed a key role in the entire process by participating in all employee co-\ncreation workshops, gathering insights and acting like a change agent\ninternally,\u201d she says. She adds that a number of HR policies were revisited,\nas well as the overall employer value proposition for attraction and retention\nof talent.\n\nRegardless whether a company decides to adopt ABW or HR technology, the bottom\nline remains the same: attract talent and retain staff. \u201cEmployees are a\ncompany\u2019s greatest asset, so it only makes sense that robust decision support\ntools are used in managing such an asset,\u201d states EngageRocket\u2019s Mr Leong.\n\n\u201cAs each individual seeks to realise their unique potential in the workforce\nand companies seek to maximise their return on labour, technology and\nanalytics play an important role as an intermediary to support the goals of\nboth parties.\u201d He adds: \u201cNot only would staff be more loyal and happier as\nthey pursue and realise their career aspirations, companies will be able to\nreap the benefits of a more productive workforce.\u201d\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n## [BREAKING NEWS](/breaking-news)\n\n05:26 PM\n\nApr 8, 2020 05:26

Leong has\nexpertise in performance management, organisational development, workforce\nanalytics, and business strategy. Most recently he was director of Gallup in\nSoutheast Asia, leading teams of consultants to grow the business by more than\n20% for three consecutive years. Yiu specialises in process re-engineering,\ncost optimisation and change management. She served as the head of operations\nfor Gallup (Southeast Asia) and oversaw the execution of large-scale\nconsulting projects for clients in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,\nPhilippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Australia and Dubai.\n\nYiu says they started the business because they recognise that on the supply\nside, data analytics has become cheaper and faster than ever before and on the\ndemand side, the expectation on information being real time has increased.\n\n\"Yet, people management still remains a challenge and we don't see a good\nproduct in the market that gives leaders real time feedback and make sense of\nthe data from their people,\" she notes. \"It was something we struggled with\nback in consulting days where we see a better way of doing things but there\nweren't available tools.\"\n\nThe problem they are trying to solve, Yiu shares, is that companies aren't\noptimising their most expensive asset, the people. \"There are a lot of\ninsights that can be drawn with people analytics that directly contributes to\nimportant business metrics - productivity, profitability, retention, for\ninstance - but there aren't sufficient knowledge or tools in the market to\neducate leaders, people managers and HR on leverage such data,\" she says.\n\nEngageRocket has already seen some wins. For instance, Yiu shares that the CEO\nof one of their early customers faced an issue with their retail team. He was\nseeing high attrition and low productivity, and brought EngageRocket in to\nassess the engagement level of the team.\n\nFrom the very first administration of the employee engagement survey, they\nwere able to discover specific problem areas that the head of retail could\naddress immediately. \"After three administrations, they saw significant\nimprovement in the team's engagement and productivity,\" Yiu says.\n\n\"EngageRocket has started a new level of transparency in our culture, allowing\nteam managers to receive frequent and regular feedback to nip team issues in\nthe bud. Using the data to coach these managers has also led to useful\ndevelopment conversations to strengthen my leadership bench,\" says Leong.\n\nOn future plans to boost the business, Yiu says they intend to keep\nstrengthening their analytics and advice services in line with their aim to\n\"ditigise consulting\" with the latest advances in AI and to expand globally.  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Acceleration of the establishment of job training institutions and professional certification in the SPPUR field as well as the development of job training tools and competency certification, including trainers and assessors, and certification schemes; and\n  3. Mutual recognition arrangement - SPPUR competency certification with similar professional certification issued both domestically and abroad.\n\nThe framework will be implemented in stages starting 1 July 2020.\n\nThe MoU was signed by the Minister of Manpower (Menaker), Ida Fauziyah; Head\nof BNSP, Visit Advisory; and the Governor of BI, Perry Warjiyo at Bank\nIndonesia Jakarta.\n\nMenaker Ida explained, the financial and banking services sector is a sector\nthat has a very high level of risk that can affect the national economic\necosystem. For this reason, operational capabilities or competencies are\nneeded for human resources working in the banking sector.\n\n\"In the context of manpower, operational capabilities or competencies for\nhuman resources (are important), namely for those who have technical and\nmanagerial skills in applying the principles of governance and banking\nbusiness practices,\" she explained.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [The highest-paying HR roles in Indonesia in\n2020](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-highest-paying-hr-roles-in-\nindonesia-malaysia-and-thailand-in-2020/)\n\nThe next important step, according to the Minister, will be to apply the new\nframework towards education and training, accreditation of training\ninstitutions, competency certification, and its application in industry (for\nexample as one of the criteria in the recruitment or employee promotion\nprocess).\n\nMinister Ida also affirmed the Ministry's commitment towards developing work\ncompetency standards and triple skilling (skilling, re-skilling and up-\nskilling) to uplift talent in Indonesia.\n\n\"We hope that accelerating human resource competency improvement programmes\nsuch as apprenticeship will be done by all national banks under the\ncoordination of Bank Indonesia,\" he said.\n\n_Photo /[Bank Indonesia](https://www.bi.go.id/id/ruang-media/info-\nterbaru/Pages/BI-Kemnaker-RI-dan-BNSP-Sepakati-Tiga-Langkah-Penguatan-\nKompetensi-Pelaku-SPPUR-di-Bank-dan-Non-Bank.aspx)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

In other words, if employees are happy,\norganizations are happy.\n\nDorothy Yiu and Leong Chee Tung knew this well. While working at US-based\nconsulting firm Gallup, they realized one more thing: there wasn't a good way\nto get accurate and meaningful real-time data that was important in\nunderstanding and improving the overall employee experience in order to retain\ntalents and improve organizational performance. So they decided to quit their\njobs and launch EngageRocket, a Singapore-based workplace analytics provider,\nin 2016. \"Our vision is to create better workplaces with people analytics and\nto make this possible for companies at a lower cost than hiring traditional\nconsultants,\" says Yiu.  \n![](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1551858290_DorothyYiuEngageRocketCOO.jpg?width=1000)\n\n **The Working**\n\nEngageRocket partners with companies who have a strong focus on improving the\nworkplace experience for their talents.\n\nTheir software automates the administration and analytics behind employee\nfeedback and delivers relevant real-time insights and actionable\nrecommendation to leaders, HR and managers of organizations.  \"We have built\nthe software such that it is simple and easy to regularly get feedback from\nyour employee at various touch points throughout the employee lifecycle. Real-\ntime analysis of the feedback also enables EngageRocket to serve as an early\nwarning system for talent disengagement. Proprietary algorithms and artificial\nintelligence like machine reasoning are also used to turn the data into\nimmediate insights and action ideas,\" says Yiu.\n\nShe believes that employee engagement is \"extremely crucial\" in the success of\nany organization. \"People are organizations most important and often, the most\nexpensive asset. Raising employee engagement first and foremost has a direct\nimpact on business outcomes,\" she says.\n\nResearch agrees. An earlier Gallup study has shown that more engaged teams see\n21 per cent higher in profitability and 20 per cent greater productivity.\nWhat's more, offering a better employee experience doesn't only make employees\nmore productive but they will also stay longer. Gallup study has also found\nthat highly engaged organizations report up to 65 per cent lower turnover.\nGiven that replacing an employee can cost on average six to nine months'\nsalary in recruitment fees, training costs and lost in productivity, the\nsupport for better retention makes a strong case for greater employee\nengagement.\n\n **Things to Know**\n\nTo create a successful startup, Yiu says, you need to understand that there is\npower in your voice and use it well. \"Entrepreneurship can be a lonely\njourney. Find a partner you trust and has proven to complement your\ncompetencies. Not only will the journey be less lonely, you will also find\ngreater strength as a team. Next, find and remember your 'why'. Building a\nbusiness is going to be challenging and with every two steps forward, you may\nhave to take one step back. Remembering your why and what motivates you will\nkeep the fire burning in trying times,\" she says.\n\nWhile talking about this year's International Women's Day theme,\n#Balanceforbetter, she says, at an organization level, companies can strive\nfor a greater gender balance at the highest level by reassessing recruitment\nand promotion criteria. Multiple research studies have already proven that\ncompanies with more female leaders outperform those companies with less.\n\nSecondly, she adds, at a societal level, \"we can be more conscious in offering\nequal opportunities to both genders.

companies need to reduce the gap\nbetween the promised Employee Value Proposition and reality.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | June 28, 2019\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) | [Employee\nExperience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-experience/)

[Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-486307498.jpg)\n\n\n\nA study made by [Weber\nShandwick](https://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/EmployerBrandCredibilityGap.pdf)\nreveals that only 19% of employees globally perceive a strong alignment\nbetween what their employer says about itself and their experience working\nthere.\n\nWe have been talking about the \u201cFuture of Work\u201d for the past decades. What if\nthe future of work is now? HR is already struggling to find playbooks on how\nto attract, retain and engage a diverse workforce that consists of part-time\nstaff, contract workers, millennials, talents approaching retirement and so\non.\n\nHow do companies define an attractive Employee Value Proposition (EVP)? Most\nimportantly , how do you meet this promise?\n\n\n\n**From Employee Value Proposition to Talent Value Proposition**\n\nNew technology and business practices have led to the evolution of the\ntraditional employment relationship. Facing a skilled labour shortage and a\nfierce competition to attract and retain talent, organisations have no choice\nbut to deal with a growing dependence on independent workers.\n\nPart-time contracts, contract workers, consultants or even remote employees,\nthe structure of the workplace has never been more diverse. [A study released\nby Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/10/17/freelancing-in-\namerica-2017/) announces that freelance workforce growth is accelerating and\nhas outpaced overall U.S. workforce growth by three times since 2014.\n\n__ Just as how traditional employees who are disengaged generate a substantial\nrevenue loss due to lost productivity, the level of engagement of contract\nworkers is also likely to affect business outcomes.\n\nThis evolution of employment imposes HR leaders to define and deliver a talent\nvalue proposition that takes into account all workers with any contract\nstatus.\n\n****\n\n### **\u201cOne-size-fits-one\u201d as the key** **differentiator**\n\nAs a part of the EVP, companies should focus on delivering an employee\nexperience that truly differentiates it as an employer.\n\nImproving the employee experience is an ongoing process and needs to be\napplied across the milestones of the employee journey from Day One: through\nOnboarding, Engagement, Development, Performance, Transition, and Separation.\n\nMore than that, in order to build a strong EVP, this needs to be cross-\nreferenced against other variables such as the employee\u2019s stage of life:\nGeneration Z, young parents, employees approaching retirement and others.\n\nOrganisations need to rethink their talent strategy: how they would\npersonalise the employee experience from a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d to a \u201cone-size-\nfits-one\u201d approach that promises to be more engaging for different employee\npersonas and more productive for employers.\n\nJust as organisations collect and analyse data across the customer's journey\nto understand buyers\u2019 behaviors, they should do the same across their\nemployees\u2019 lifecycle to build positive experiences.\n\nEmployee lifecycle analytics can help understand how HR processes are working\nand where there are chances for improvement to tie it back to management\ndecisions.\n\nNew technologies allow HR to set up continuous listening architecture to\ncollect employee feedback and powerful insights across the employee lifecycle\nwithout recruiting an army of data scientists.\n\n****\n\n### **How do you reduce the gap and meet the promise?**\n\n**** The ability to analyse real-time signals on how employees think and feel\nallows leaders to take a proactive approach in talent management. Equipping\nmanagers this way would allow them to monitor and reduce the gap between the\npromised EVP and reality.\n\nAnother way to reduce this gap is for organisations to meet employee\nexpectations. One of the recurring expectations of the modern workforce is the\ndesire to grow and fulfill a purpose within their organisation.\n\nA study published by Gallup announces that 87% of millennial workers report\nthat development is \"important\" in their job.\n\nPart of the responsibility of managers comes being actively responsible for\nthe growth of the people they manage. Continuously identifying skills gaps and\nencouraging employees to develop new competencies will have a positive impact\non employee engagement.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that people join companies, but leave managers.\nReducing the gap between promised EVP and reality starts with getting buy-in\nfrom managers who lead employees every day.\n\nThey need to create an environment of trust for each employee, acknowledging\nthat each comes with her unique strengths and paths to achieving the desired\noutcome.\n\n**About the Author**  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/EngageRocketCEO.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/EngageRocketCEO.png)Leong Chee Tung is the CEO of\nEngageRocket.  \n  \nGiving out red packets or \u2018angpaos\u2019 to employees is one of the top Lunar New\nYear traditions practised by SMEs in many parts of Asia.\n\nBusiness owners view this as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation to thank\ntheir staff for their hard work and contributions in the past year.

Those who\nresisted change for a while now have also been arm-twisted to adapt to the\nalternate ways of living and working. On the darker side, economies might be\nmoving to a phase of recession as businesses find it extremely difficult to\noperate smoothly amid this crisis. Most countries are either under lockdown or\nare practicing social distancing.\n\nThe chaos and the confusion caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is sure to create\nanxiety among all. But what can help in this time of crisis is consistent\ncommunication with a combination of empathy and compassion. And thanks to the\npresence of digital media, communicating virtually is no longer a challenge.\n\nLeaders all over the world are using technology to communicate with people,\ninform them about action steps being taken to fight the crisis, rally their\ntotal support to avert spreading the crisis further, dispel an atmosphere of\nfear, foster trust that all nations are in together and that governments will\nsupport citizens during such testing times.\n\nCommunication is a hallmark of effective leadership during crisis times.\nHere\u2019s what characterizes effective communication in times of crisis:\n\n### Communication and Consistency\n\nThe most important thing for organizations during this crisis is to ensure\nconnections between people remain strong. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi\nhas acknowledged this need at the national level and urged everyone to come in\ntheir balconies or at their doors to light candles, diya, or torch or mobile\u2019s\nflashlight to show that we are in this together.\n\nThis is not the first time that he addressed the nation. Eversince the\npandemic has hit our country he has appeared quite a few times now on national\ntelevision to share with everyone the latest updates and to express gratitude\nto those on the frontline just as all political leaders the world over have\nbeen doing. Similarly many business leaders are recording video messages\naddressing their employees and extended colleagues with great empathy. Whether\nit is Amazon's Jeff Bezos memo to the employees or the heartfelt video message\nof Marriott's President & CEO Arne Sorrenson, leaders are ensuring that the\nemployees\u2019 anxiety over job security and business continuity is kept in check.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln once said, \u201cIf given the truth, people can be depended upon\nto meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.\u201d\n\n### Communication and Compassion\n\nDuring a crisis, the ability to show compassion to the people impacted can\nmake the entire difference in whether you will succeed or fail in the long\nrun. Acknowledging the efforts of those on the frontlines and addressing the\nchallenges of affected employees in each video message or communication that\nleaders share is essential.\n\nLeaders also have to actively listen to the needs of the people and create a\nforum where people can share their challenges and concerns. An open\nenvironment and a culture where highest importance is given to people\u2019s safety\nand health is most important amid the current COVID-19 crisis.\n\n### Communication and Symbolism\n\nJust as it is important to keep communicating consistently during a crisis to\nprevent fear, at the same time it is also important to reinforce a sense of\nhope and optimism. Human beings are emotional creatures and in dark times,\neven symbolic gestures help a lot in rallying people together for a common\ncause and keep their faith steady and strong during the crisis. It could be as\nsimple as lighting candles together or switching off lights for some time\nsimultaneously-sending out a message of solidarity-that we are all together in\nthis. This is perfectly illustrated by the DNA of the Earth Hour movement,\nwhich implores people the world over to switch off lights at their home for an\nhour on a designated day at a designated time. The idea is simple- even a\nsymbolic gesture like switching off lights together can rally so many people\ntogether for a common cause and becomes a way to communicate about the crisis\nand gather greater support. Hence even simple symbolism plays an important\nrole when communicating in a crisis.\n\nHowever, communication should not only be about symbolism. It should give\nthose affected a clear idea of what\u2019s in store for them, what they are\nexpected to do, and what governments or organizations are doing for them in\norder to help them tide through the crisis. Ultimately, clear, consistent, and\nempathetic communication is what helps governments and management to\neffectively lead and navigate nations and organizations through times of\ncrisis and otherwise as well.\n\n> _**\"There's always an opportunity with a crisis.

But is this a\nreflective of problem with the employees - or with the organisation?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | February 1, 2019\n\nTopics: [Compensation and\nBenefits](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Employee Experience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-\nexperience/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[Recruitment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/recruitment/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-513494534.jpg)\n\n\n\n**About the Author**  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/EngageRocketCEO.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/EngageRocketCEO.png)Leong Chee Tung is the CEO of\nEngageRocket.  \n  \nGiving out red packets or \u2018angpaos\u2019 to employees is one of the top Lunar New\nYear traditions practised by SMEs in many parts of Asia.\n\nBusiness owners view this as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation to thank\ntheir staff for their hard work and contributions in the past year. However is\nthis too little too late?\n\nWith [employee engagement levels in Singapore consistently reported\nlow](https://www.businessinsider.sg/2018-employee-engagement-trends-singapore-\nemployees-least-engaged-among-major-asian-markets/) even within Asia and a\nstudy last year which showed [almost half of Singaporean workers planning to\nquit their job within a year](https://www.theedgesingapore.com/close-half-\nsingaporean-workers-plan-quit-their-current-jobs-within-year-survey), the risk\nof star performers leaving suddenly after the lunar new year cannot be\nignored.\n\n\n\n## **The secret reason why people leave**\n\nThe problem with people leaving is that they are rarely honest about why. Exit\ninterviews at the point of departure do a bad job of capturing root causes,\nbecause nobody wants to burn bridges with their past bosses and colleagues.\n\nTo shed some light on the real reasons, numerous empirical studies have shown\nthat people [join companies, but leave\nmanagers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2015/08/04/people-leave-\nmanagers-not-companies/#537f401c47a9).\n\nAs the main interface between the employee and the company, it is estimated\nthat [more than 70% of the variation in engagement\nlevels](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-\nvariance-employee-engagement.aspx) of employees can be attributed to their\ninteractions with their direct boss.\n\nThis is a challenge because so few of us are naturally inclined to be great\nmanagers. Studies show that [only 1 in 10](https://www.inc.com/marcel-\nschwantes/only-1-in-10-people-has-right-skills-to-manage-heres-5-things-they-\ndo-to-succeed-the-other-9-rarely-will.html) are born with this talent, while\nthe rest of us need to find other ways of being successful managing others.\n\n\n\n## **How to build early warning systems against talent drain**\n\nIn executing business plans, we rarely rise to the level of our goals.\nInstead, we fall to the level of our systems.\n\nFor the 90% of us who are not natural great managers, this means we need to be\nproactive in building solid systems to assist us in managing our people.\n\nWith technology and analytics as advanced as they are today, thankfully this\ndoes not have to be difficult.\n\n\"Running an engagement survey once a year (or once every few years), then\nhoping that an action plan on that single data point will miraculously retain\ntalent is a misunderstanding that is costing them millions of dollars a year  \n---  \n  \nFor example, the basic employee engagement process in more than 70% of\ncompanies in Asia today is causing them to fail.\n\nRunning an engagement survey once a year (or once every few years), then\nhoping that an action plan on that single data point will miraculously retain\ntalent is a misunderstanding that is costing them millions of dollars a year.\n\nTo set busy managers up for success and improve their understanding of their\npeople, using technology to run more frequent pulse surveys - few targeted\nquestions, asked more often - coupled with deeply segmented analysis will\nallow leaders and HR to quickly identify troubling trends and take action\nbefore it is too late.\n\nEncouraging a system of regular one-on-ones between managers and employees can\nhelp to provide not only a good qualitative understanding of the challenges\neach employee faces, but also gives the managers protected time to recognise\ngood work done, take an interest in their personal well-being and help them\nplan their careers in the company strategically.\n\nWithin the HR department, even deploying these simple tools and reviewing the\nparticipation of managers and employees can give strong leading indicators of\ntalent attrition.\n\n\n\n## **Ways to improve engagement**\n\nEven after putting in place early warning systems, HR cannot reduce the\nchances of \u2018regrettable attrition\u2019 alone.\n\nThe most important task in talent retention is actually getting buy-in from\nthe business heads who lead those employees every day.\n\nTogether, they need to create an environment of trust and respect for each\nemployee, acknowledging that each comes with her unique strengths and paths to\nachieving the desired outcome.\n\nA few suggestions to improve the levels of employee engagement:\n\n### _Improve **autonomy**_\n\nAsian companies can be very process-driven, to the point that we encourage\n\"zombie workers\" who minimise personal initiative to avoid making process\nerrors.\n\nBy focusing on the achievement of outcomes and understanding that having a\ndifferent process is favourable even if it deviates from Standard Operating\nProtocol, leaders can celebrate autonomy and creativity.\n\n### _Find ways to nurture m **astery**_\n\nThere is a high cultural emphasis on taking on managerial responsibilities,\nwith managers usually receiving more pay, respect & prestige than individual\ncontributors.\n\nInstead of focusing incentives just on rising up the managerial rungs, HR can\ncreate multiple paths of success through masterful individual contribution.\n\n### _Over-communicate **Purpose**_\n\nWith a sometimes excessive focus on doing things right instead of doing the\nright things, many Asian leaders choose to focus on communicating the \"how\" of\na process, instead of spending time communicating the \"why\".\n\nLeaders should always err on the side of over-communicating purpose and\ndrawing a line of sight from individual work to value.\n\nFinally, to track the success of these initiatives, HR needs to implement a\nsystem of continuous listening, through multiple feedback channels with solid\nanalytics to extract actionable insight from all the feedback data.\n\nThis would provide a clear map of who needs intervention and when.\n\nWith these measures in place, there is a greater chance that those getting the\n\u2018angpaos\u2019 over the Lunar New Year would stay on to contribute even more in the\nmonths and years to come.\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\nemployers-can-avoid-the-angpao-exodus%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+employers+can+avoid+the+%27angpao%27+exodus&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\nemployers-can-avoid-the-angpao-exodus%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhow-\nemployers-can-avoid-the-angpao-exodus%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\nHaving an engaged employee does wonders for businesses - needless to say, when\nan employee is positively engaged and motivated for work, they will put in\ntheir best efforts to drive the organisation forward.\n\nThis was affirmed during a panel session at the [10th Annual Global DWEN\nSummit](https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/women-powering-business)\nyesterday, attended by _Human Resources Online,_ where panellists discussed\nthe need for engaging employees the right way, and how employers and HR\nleaders can do so.\n\nPanellists _(pictured above from L-R)_ :\n\n  * **Moderator:** Meghan E. Butler, Contributing Writer\n  * Mandy Gilbert, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Creative Niche, Inc.\n  * Tiffany See, Head of Human Resources, Asia, BHP\n  * Dorothy Yiu, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, EngageRocket\n\nSnippets of the discussion below:\n\n### **Measuring employee engagement is becoming more agile**\n\nAccording to **Dorothy Yiu, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer,\nEngageRocket** , employee engagement is defined in two ways - first, intrinsic\nmotivation of employees, and second, the measure of productivity.\n\nFurther, with workplace transformation moving rapidly, organisations are\nswitching up the way they measure employee engagement.\n\nFor instance, Yiu said, an analysis on companies found even in the most\nadvanced companies like Facebook, employers find surveys to be the most\neffective forms of measurement. In fact, organisations are moving towards more\nagile pulse surveys today.\n\nThus, it is important that HR leaders and employers in-charge of measuring\nemployee engagement cascade the resulting data down to the respective line\nmanagers at the soonest, as this would prove more useful than data that is two\nto three months old (as currently used). Yiu stressed: \"It is better to equip\nline managers with day-to-day data that they can work on instead.\"\n\n### Organisations need to focus on building a positive culture\n\nAs **Tiffany See, Head of Human Resources, Asia, BHP** was quick to point out:\n\n> ##### Culture is like the secret sauce - it differentiates the good from the\n> bad in the company.\n\nIn building a strong culture that would engage and retain talent, See\nhighlights three things to note:\n\n  * First, HR and employers should think about the values that are important to them and the company.\n  * Second, she says: \"Define what those values are, what they look like and what they don't look like. Once you've got clarity on them, think about how you want to see them played out.\"\n  * Third, the leadership team should decide how people are going to be role models of those values. See adds: \"When you have reinforcement everyday, you become more aware of what the values you desire are.\"\n\nFurther, **Mandy Gilbert, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Creative Niche,\nInc.** , added that transparency in communication is key, whereby employers\nshould be clear from the start in letting employees know what the organisation\nis all about. How? She says: \"The experience sharing of leaders, and being\n'vulnerable'. It also helps in learning from other people's mistakes.\"\n\n**Moderator Meghan E. Butler, Contributing Writer** , added: \"Be clear on what\nyou want to achieve; if you have a spirit of transparency and it means a lot\nto you, talk about it. Let the team know why you started the business.\n\n\"When onboarding someone, give them a history of your company, what it's\nabout, have a schedule for their first two weeks here. Incorporate your\ncompany's values in onboarding so there's nothing else for them to learn\n(about the company) down the road.\"\n\nIn addition, Meghan shared that creating a sense of belonging is crucial to\nhaving a conducive team and overall workplace culture.\n\n### The most disruptive trend: A multigenerational workforce\n\nCiting a survey conducted on HR leaders, which asked them what they expected\nto see as the most disruptive trend in the workforce, Yiu noted that\n\"surprisingly\", the most common reply was a multigenerational workforce.\n\nIt was also found that while\n[Millennials](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/how-millennials-and-gen-z-\nacross-southeast-asia-differ-in-their-ambitions-and-concerns/) wanted\nrecognition and autonomy, the older generation wanted stability.\n\nTo this, See stressed the importance of managers making a point to \"understand\ngenerational differences\" by having conversations with them to find out what\nis important, what is needed, and how to shape them.\n\n_Photo / Journalist 's own_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

It will also introduce partial cuts to\nthe annual bonuses of senior management, who were asked to voluntarily lower\ntheir base salaries by as much as 5%.\n\nWith the money saved, Temasek will donate to staff volunteer initiatives and\nsupport the community as needed through unspecified measures. It will also\nmatch dollar-for-dollar any voluntary base salary reductions.\n\nRead more from\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-25/temasek-to-\nfreeze-pay-cut-bonuses-for-a-year-amid-coronavirus).\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n\"Don't be afraid to be different\", \"persevere and overcome whatever challenges\nare ahead of you\", and \"your work, knowledge and performance earn you respect\"\n\u2013 these are just [some of the nuggets of advice that women leaders would share\nwith their younger selves](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/pearls-of-\nwisdom-career-advice-from-women-leaders-to-their-younger-selves/) if given the\nopportunity.\n\nIn this seventh part of our 16-part series, see what advice women leaders such\nas Manuela Dragomir of ING, Barkha Jasani of Quadrant, Toh Mong Sah of Wipro\nUnza Malaysia, and many more would give to their younger selves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Yuko Nakahira, Managing Director, 3M Singapore\n\n> ##### Having started my career in 3M Japan in R&D where I stayed for eight\n> years, I would have made my move into business and stepped out of Japan much\n> earlier to accelerate my learning curve.\n\nThis would have increased my exposure to different learning opportunities and\nleadership styles.\n\n* * *\n\n### Aileen Tang, Head of Marketing, ASEAN, Japan and Korea, Commvault\n\nSuccess stems from the strength of self and situational awareness.\n\n> ##### As you climb the ladder, place the team above yourself \u2013 people are\n> the greatest assets you can have, especially when change is a constant. Take\n> care of your team, and they will take care of the business, and you.\n\nShowing vulnerability as a leader is never wrong, this is when connections are\nmade and strengthened.\n\n* * *\n\n### Dorothy Yiu, Co-Founder and COO of EngageRocket\n\n> ##### Don\u2019t lament so much about what others think of you. If you give them\n> the power to build you up, they\u2019ll have the same power to break you down.\n\nGive yourself permission to be afraid but feel the fear and do it anyway. What\nyou will most definitely find on the other side of that fear, is growth.\n\n* * *\n\n### Manuela Dragomir, Regional Head of HR for Asia-Pacific, ING\n\n> ##### Don\u2019t be afraid to be different. Don\u2019t be afraid to show you are\n> vulnerable. Don\u2019t be afraid to speak up. Don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself.\n> Courage doesn\u2019t have any gender.\n\n* * *\n\n### Liu Lu, Co-Founder & Chief Operating Officer, JustCo\n\n> ##### Savor the small joys, celebrate milestones that mean something to you\n> no matter how small, and enjoy them every step of the way. Never compare\n> yourself to others, but also never give up competing against yourself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Dr Shireen Henry, MyDoc's Clinical Operations Director\n\n> ##### Don\u2019t focus on your weaknesses and spend all your time trying to\n> improve your weak points. It's more effective to identify and play to your\n> own strengths or talents.\n\nYour weakness or potential shortcomings may be the strength or talent found in\nanother team member, so it\u2019s ok!\n\nI use the example of writing - if you are right handed, you have a much better\nchance of improving your handwriting in your right hand opposed to teaching\nyour left hand to write better. Your left hand will never be as good as the\nright - no matter how much you train or practise, but with training and\npractice your right hand can learn to write even more beautifully! (This\nanalogy excludes the truly ambidextrous people, of course.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Barkha Jasani, Director of Engineering at Quadrant\n\nAs a leader I always have a million and one ideas that I want to do\nparticularly around the location data space and blockchain. Patience is\nneeded, though, and when things don\u2019t go to plan, don\u2019t give up!\n\n> ##### Persevere and overcome whatever challenges are ahead of you.\n\n* * *\n\n### Arlene Wherrett, VP & Managing Director, Sage Asia\n\n> ##### I would say \u2013 you go girl!\n\nDuring the 80s, when starting my career \u2013 the pressure on women to \u2018do it all\u2019\nwas tremendous. While I did manage to juggle career, relationships, graduate\nstudies, children, volunteering and moving countries \u2013 if I had to do it over\nagain \u2013 I would want to be a bit gentler with myself \u2013 knowing that I could\n\u2018do it all\u2019 over time, instead of all at once.\n\nRather than focusing on \u2018fixing the women\u2019, men and women alike must change\ntheir mindsets and truly recognise and appreciate the benefits of diversity\nand inclusion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Malina Platon, Managing Director of ASEAN at UiPath\n\n> ##### Keep learning, be positive, always have an open heart and mind, wear\n> your passion on your sleeves! Trust your dreams fiercely and work\n> relentlessly for make them happen!\n\nLife is a continuous journey of professional and personal learning\nexperiences, shaping us towards the best version of ourselves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Jasie Fon, General Manager, ASEAN at Workday\n\n> ##### I would remind myself to pursue my ambitions with tenacity and not let\n> other people\u2019s perceptions deter me from becoming the best that I can be.\n\nAs long as I have faith in myself, I\u2019d be able to step outside of my comfort\nzone and be capable of conquering the impossible.\n\n* * *\n\n### Toh Mong Sah, Head of Research & Development, Wipro Unza Malaysia\n\n> ##### Your work, knowledge and performance earn you respect.

The\n> city-state and island country is a major financial centre, the Asia-Pacific\n> headquarters for a number of global players, and a startup launchpad for the\n> Southeast Asia region.\n\n  \n\nReal estate services company **Colliers** ranked Singapore as the second best\nplace to start a tech operation in Asia, behind Bangalore. **Startup Genome**\nranked Singapore among the top 12 startup hubs globally, with over 4,300 tech\nstartups. Though a small country of 5.6 million people, it has invested\nheavily in its Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 plan.\n\n  \n\nVenture capital investments in its startups increased from $136.4 million in\n2012 to $1.37 billion in 2017, according to **Edwin Chow, Assistant CEO,\nEnterprise Singapore.** Local firms such as Changi Airport Group, ST\nEngineering, and Zicom MedTacc have tapped the local startup ecosystem, in\naddition to a range of MNCs.\n\n  \n\nEnterprise Singapore launched the **Startup SG** initiative in 2017 as a\nsingle platform for startup information and community connects. **The Global\nInnovation Alliance** was introduced in 2017 to connect 'the Little Red Dot'\nwith other global startup and innovation hubs.\n\n  \n\n![1](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/28b451402d6a11e9aa979329348d4c3e/SG21569389605667jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n##  **Overview**\n\n  \n\nThe book begins with an overview of Singapore facts and necessities such as\nease of doing business (second in the world, according to the World Bank),\nsupport for women entrepreneurs (fifth best in the world, according to\nMasterCard), multiculturalism (melting pot), living costs (expensive), cuisine\n(foodie's paradise), alcohol (expensive; sixth most expensive city in the\nworld for beers), people (respectful), tax authorities (most efficient),\npublic transport (efficient, affordable), and language (English, Singlish, and\nothers).\n\n  \n\n> Singapore allows a foreigner to own 100 percent of the stock of a Singapore-\n> incorporated company. Around 30 percent of the population consists of\n> expats. Anti-corruption and IP laws are strictly enforced.\n\n  \n\n **Singapore is home to multiple unicorn startups, such as Grab, Lazada,\nRazer, Sea, and Trax.** Recent successes in funding rounds have been announced\nby local startups such as lifestyle-based app Carousell, insurtech company\nCSX, AI-driven storytelling platform Nugit, and gaming startup Sea (formerly\nGarena).\n\n  \n\n **The median age of Singaporean entrepreneurs is 28 years, the youngest\nglobally.** Singapore also plays host to prominent startup events and\nconferences, such as InnovFest Unbound, Slush Singapore, and Singapore Week of\nInnovation and Technology (SWITCH).\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/6efbaa90-9c6f-11e8-b2bf-f7f75f609684/FeatureImage-p1556868757313.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Prudential Singapore seeks collaboration with technology companies to\nchart the future of insur...\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2019/05/prudential-singapore-fintegrate-partnership-\nprogramme)\n\n* * *\n\n##  **I.

Others have\nbeen supported by incubators at NUS, NTU and PayPal.\n\n  \n\n![2](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/28b451402d6a11e9aa979329348d4c3e/SG31569389640767jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n##  **II. Startup ecosystem**\n\n  \n\nTwo sections of the book profile the support system for startups, ranging from\ncoworking spaces to programmes at incubators and accelerators. For example,\nthe **NUS Startup Runway** programme is an incubation and acceleration\nprogramme offered by NUS Enterprise, the university's entrepreneurial arm.\n\n  \n\n**Antler** is an early-stage VC looking for \"daredevils and creative\nthinkers\". According to Southeast Asia Managing Partner Jussi Salovaara, the\nantler metaphor refers to moving \"onward and upward and forking to different\ndirections\".\n\n  \n\nIt has programmes in Singapore, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London and Sydney. For a\nfive-month accelerator programme, Antler invests up to S$100,000 for a company\nvaluation of S$1 million.\n\n  \n\n**Entrepreneur First** is a talent investor focusing on sectors like deep\ntech. It looks for entrepreneurs with \"unfair competitive advantage\", which it\ncalls the \"Edge\". Its six-month programme has graduated more than 150 startups\nacross its hubs in London, Berlin, Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bangalore.\n\n  \n\nThe **SAP.iO Foundry** accelerator programme connects early-stage startups to\nSAP and its global customer base. The program launched in 2017, with branches\nin San Francisco, New York, Berlin, Paris, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Singapore.\n\n  \n\n> The **SAP Next-Gen** platform focuses on startups addressing the UN's 17\n> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its network spans 3,700 educational\n> institutions and 130 labs in 117 countries.\n\n  \n\n**Startup Station Singapore,** backed by Facebook, Singapore's Infocomm Media\nDevelopment Authority, and innovation consultancy Rainmaking, supports\nstartups working on data-centric solutions.\n\n  \n\nThe **Unilever Foundry** platform connects Unilever's many brands and business\nunits to tech startups.  Co-working space **LEVEL3** was formed by Unilever\nFoundry and Padang & Co. It is home to 65 startups and eight corporate\npartners: Unilever, WPP, Cargill, MUFG Bank, Syngenta, Microsoft, Deloitte and\nSTMicroelectronics.\n\n**\" We believe that the world's 'billion-dollar problems' cannot be solved by\nindividual organisations but rather through collaborative innovation,\" says\nAdam Lyle,** Executive Chairman, Padang & Co. LEVEL3 hosts MUFG Bank's Digital\nASEAN Programme, which has launched an agritech accelerator.\n\n  \n\nA range of other co-working spaces is active in Singapore, such as **BLOCK71**\n, initiated by NUS Enterprise. It was launched together with Singtel Innov8,\nand startups such as Carousell and 99.co began here. BLOCK71 has locations in\nChina, the US, and Indonesia as well.\n\n  \n\n **Trehaus,** which combines the Spanish word for three ( _tres_ ) with the\nGerman word for house ( _Haus_ ) is a unique coworking space for working\nparents.

Other co-working\nspaces include **Collision 8, Found** (which also runs seed fund\nFound.Ventures), **Working Capitol,** and **The Hive.**\n\n  \n\n![3](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/28b451402d6a11e9aa979329348d4c3e/SG51569389679539jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n##  **III. Expert insights**\n\n  \n\nOne section of the book provides expert tips from accelerators and startup\nconsultancies in the city. The advice covers customer engagement, marketing,\nsustainability, and talent.\n\n  \n\n **MING Labs** is a global digital venture builder with a strong focus on\ndesign. \"Start by getting out of the building and interviewing at least 10\ntarget customers. Learn about their needs, pain points, motivations, and\nbehaviours,\" advises Sebastian Muller, Co-founder and COO of MING Labs.\n\n  \n\nMany founders do not fully understand their target customers' needs or may not\nhave clearly defined the problem. **\" Validating the prototype with real\ncustomers will help reduce risk during the production process and move your\nsolution in the right direction,\" **Sebastian advises. The firm has offices in\nSingapore, Shanghai, Berlin, Munich, and New York, with clients such as BMW,\nBOSCH, Lufthansa, and Siemens.\n\n  \n\n\"Startups play a significant role in Singapore's economy,\" says Jonathan Lim,\ndirector of Global Innovation Network at **Enterprise Singapore.** \"It is\nvital that we do not merely build up our competencies in silos but that we\nbring them together to form an active knowledge economy,\" he adds, urging\nfounders to attend events and conferences for peer connects and learning.\n\n  \n\n **Cargill,** a LEVEL3 partner for co-innovation with APAC startups, launched\nCargill Digital Labs (CDL) to prepare for the digital future. It has invested\nin startups like New Mexico-based Descartes Labs (satellite imagery for\nagriculture) and Dublin-based Cainthus (facial recognition on cows).\n\n  \n\n **\" Be purpose-driven and start with a problem statement that addresses the\nchallenges faced in the food industry,\"** advises Kin Wei Soh, Chief\nInformation Officer, APAC, Cargill. Cargill is also a co-sponsor of the\nTechstars Farm to Fork Accelerator.\n\n  \n\n\"The speed at which things happen here is what makes Singapore so special for\nentrepreneurs from a legal and business perspective, especially if you compare\nit to other countries in Asia,\" observes Birgitta von Dresky, Partner,\n**Luther LLP.**\n\n  \n\n> \"Define founder roles and responsibilities from the very beginning,\" she\n> advises. Founders should turn to outside experts for tasks like accounting,\n> tax compliance or writing up contracts.\n\n  \n\n **Hotel G Singapore** has partnered with events such as Singapore Design Week\nand the Singapore International Film Festival. It also supports local artists\nvia the platform RCGNTN and e-commerce brand Kai to host events, gallery\nopenings, and pop-up stores.\n\n  \n\n\"The hospitality industry can be traditional, but there is huge potential for\nmodern technology to move the industry forward,\" observes Othmane Amrani, GM.\n**\" Don't be afraid to say no to suggestions that don't align with your\nbusiness strategy,\" **he advises founders.\n\n  \n\n **KPMG Digital Village** was launched to connect corporations, startups, and\ngovernmental bodies for co-innovation across the public and private sector. It\nadvises founders to have patience in understanding and navigating the\nhierarchy and bureaucracy of corporate customers.\n\n  \n\n **\" Embed purpose into your business. **Combine open collaboration with local\nflavour. Connect with government leaders working on initiatives linked to the\nSDGs,\" urges Ann Rosenberg, Senior Vice President and Global Head of **SAP\nNext-Gen.**\n\n  \n\n> Ann has written a book on Innovation 4.0, titled _Science Fiction: A\n> Starship for Enterprise Innovation. _\"It's time to activate your inner\n> science-fiction mindset for innovation with purpose,\" she advises.\n\n  \n\nFor Ann and SAP Next-Gen, Singapore is something of a \"science-fiction city.\"\nInnovation 4.0 is an approach combining science-fiction thinking with the SDGs\nand exponential technologies to reimagine industries and enterprises.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2014/05/Prof-\nWong.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Understanding Prof. Wong Poh Kam's vision behind the DBS-NUS Social\nVenture Challenge Asia\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2014/05/prof-wong-nus)\n\n* * *\n\n##  **IV. Founder advice**\n\n  \n\nOne section of the book interviews founders of five startups, tracing their\nentrepreneurial journeys, advice received, lessons learnt, and tips for the\nnext wave of aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\n  \n\nFrench serial entrepreneurs **Alexia Sich ere **and **Ma elle Pochat** have\nlaunched three startups: FoxySales (online flash sales site for parents and\nchildren), Wanted Labels (platform for online popup shops for fashion labels),\nand Try and Review (neutral platform for product trials and reviews).\n\n  \n\nTry and Review covers everything from snacks and beauty products to luxury\ngoods and electronics. It works with brands such as Unilever, Nestle, and\nL'Oreal, and has a database of over **one million testers** in more than 10\ncountries.\n\n  \n\n\"Be able to continuously adapt your product to the market and continuously\ninnovate,\" Alexia advises. **\" Starting a second business is always easier**\nbecause there are many mistakes you make in the first one that you don't make\nanymore, and things really move faster,\" she adds.\n\n  \n\n **Anna Vanessa Haotanto** founded women's financial investments platform The\nNew Savvy. She was one of the pioneer heads of the Singapore FinTech\nAssociation, and President of Singapore Management University Women Alumni.\n\nHer site delivers content through education, media, and conferences, and\noffers tools for financial planning such as savings, buying property, and\ninvestments. **\" We are also organising our first large-scale conference\ncalled the Future is Female,\" **Anna adds.\n\n  \n\nBut her journey was not easy.  \"I was giving up a good five-figure income and\nsome people told me not to be naive and to stick with a real job,\" she\nrecalls. \"I think I made every mistake that could have been made. But that's\nlife, isn't it? **You falter, but you pick yourself up, \" **she adds.\n\n  \n\n **\" Passion might not be enough. I think what is more important is to combine\nthe passion with a systematic process to ensure that your idea is executed\nwell. Sometimes, you also have to depend on timing and luck,\" Anna suggests.**\n\n  \n\n\"I find that Singapore still lacks an entrepreneurial environment and spirit,\nbecause we are very comfortable,\" she cautions. \"There is still a **stigma\nattached to failure** here, and maybe that's stopping people from stepping out\ninto the entrepreneurial world,\" Anna observes.\n\n  \n\n>  **Elena Chow** had a long career in HR at P&G, and then founded talent\n> solutions firm ConnectOne for the tech sector. \"Between pleasing the\n> investors and leading the team, you need to learn as well,\" she advises\n> founders.\n\n  \n\nSuch learning comes from mentors, reading, and peer circles. \"Most young\nSingaporeans have a very clear career path. Entrepreneurship is not a popular\npath; it's not seen as desirable compared to a corporate career,\" she\nobserves.\n\n  \n\n**Ho Jia Jian** and **Derek Tan** were engineering students at NUS, where they\nran a film club. They founded Viddsee as a video platform highlighting the\nwork of Asian content creators and storytellers. It helps media entrepreneurs\nsustain the audience beyond the initial burst of customer views.\n\n  \n\n**\" There's so much that a culture that's built on strong foundations can\ndo,\"** Jian advises. \"Our worst decisions were thinking you can do everything\nas a founder and not delegating by undertaking too many responsibilities,\" he\nrecalls.\n\n  \n\nThe startup has expanded to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines. Having a\nSingapore base helps with **business credibility** in meetings around the\nregion, he observes.\n\n  \n\n> Jian regards being a generalist and intrigued by everything as one of his\n> skills. \"Kind of a Jack of all trades but master of 'some,'\" he jokes.\n\n  \n\n **Stephanie Crespin** is the Founder and CEO of StyleTribute.com, a boutique\nonline marketplace for secondhand luxury fashion. Her second startup,\nReflaunt, works with brands to build circular ecosystems in the fashion\nindustry, blending style with environmental consciousness.\n\n  \n\n **Actual discussions with customers helped her overcome assumptions** that\nAsians only liked new products and regarded used products as unhygienic; the\nsavvier younger online generation did not have such barriers. Iteration and\nagility are key in this regard. \"It's not a customer's job to know what he\nwants,\" she evocatively describes.\n\n  \n\nIt is always important for entrepreneurs to **keep reframing** their outlook\nand aspirations in the course of their journey, Stephanie advisees. She says\nthe most valuable piece of advice she had been given is: **_Don 't be\nembarrassed by your first draft._**\n\n  \n\n![4](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/28b451402d6a11e9aa979329348d4c3e/SG11569389706167jpg?fm=png&auto=format&w=800&blur=500)\n\n##  **V. Schools**\n\n  \n\nOne section of the book describes educational and skilling support for\nentrepreneurs in Singapore. For example, **Singapore Institute of Management\n(SIM),** founded in 1964, launched Platform E, a non-degree entrepreneurship\nprogramme in 2016. It looks for \"intellectually curious entrepreneurs\" who are\ncoachable.\n\n  \n\n **NUS** has study-abroad programmes at more than 300 universities across 50\ncountries. Its entrepreneurial arm is called NUS Enterprise. Students are\nautomatically eligible for the university's Continuing Education and Training\ncourse upon graduation, so that they can upskill whenever necessary.\n\n  \n\n **Singapore Management University (SMU),** founded in 2000, runs the\nInstitute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a student-managed VC fund, and\none of the biggest university startup challenges in Asia. It nurtures\nentrepreneurs to \"be intellectually curious and think critically\".\n\n  \n\n **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD),** founded in 2010,\nruns the SUTD Technology Entrepreneurship Program (STEP). Students are\nexpected to submit design projects at the end of every course.\n\n  \n\nWith campuses in France, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi, **INSEAD** provides a\nglobal perspective on entrepreneurship. There are courses on Value Creation in\nLuxury and Fashion, Startup Boosters, and Artificial Intelligence Strategy for\nStartups. There is also the student-led INSEAD Entrepreneurship Club.\n\n  \n\n **General Assembly (GA),** founded in New York in 2011, offers digital\nupskilling programmes at 20 campuses worldwide, including Singapore.\n\"Attendees are required to take in and apply feedback. This can be\nparticularly challenging for professionals after years in a different career,\"\ncautions Aziza Sheerin, GA Singapore Regional Director.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2018/02/306A4545.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Meet experts from Singapore-based AIRmaker who can help you script your\nstartup success story\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2018/02/meet-experts-from-singapore-based-airmaker)\n\n* * *\n\n##  **VI. Investors**\n\n  \n\nThe final section of the book profiles active investors and their startup\nportfolios. For example, **Golden Gate Ventures** has invested in more than 30\ncompanies in Southeast Asia, such as mobile classifieds platform Carousell and\ncaregiver marketplace Homage.\n\n  \n\n> \"We like large, fragmented markets with smaller competitors where tech-first\n> solutions can disrupt and build large customer bases,\" says Founder Vinnie\n> Lauria.\n\n  \n\n **Prot ege Ventures,** a joint initiative between Kairos ASEAN and Singapore\nManagement University, invests up to S$50,000 in early-stage startups with a\nstudent or recent graduate in their management team. \"We believe that\noutstanding founders display exceptional entrepreneurial traits from a young\nage,\" says Founder Lujie Chen. The company is on the lookout for the \"next\nSnapchat and Facebook\".\n\n  \n\n **SAP.iO Fund** invests in early-stage startups that can leverage SAP\ntechnology. \"We focus on early-stage startups because we believe that with\ntechnology, a small input can drive a lot of output, which is a testament to\nthe small startups that are changing the world, hence the little 'i' and big\n'O' in SAP.iO,\" says Ram Jambunathan, SVP, SAP.iO.\n\n  \n\n> The fund generally invests alongside other Tier-1 VCs, who will lead or co-\n> lead a round.

The talent exodus after a\nlarge annual bonus payout, typically around the lunar new year, is a common\nphenomenon.\n\nBesides the emotional toll of losing good people, there are significant\nfinancial costs. The US Department of Labour estimates for junior positions,\nthis can be a third of annual salary. So to lose someone earning $42,000 a\nyear, it would cost the company $14,000 in direct training expenses and lost\nproductivity.\n\nThis figure can be up to 150-200 percent for more senior positions, according\nto estimates by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).\n\n **People join companies but leave managers**\n\nCan your company mitigate the upcoming talent drain? Possibly. And you might\nhave the best chance yet in 2019. Research from Gallup finds that one in two\npeople has left their job to get away from a manager.\n\nThis suggests that to plug the leak, managers need to get better at actively\nengaging their teams. Company HR policy, senior leadership communication and\ndirection all play a part, for sure, but they cannot explain the large\nvariance in attrition rates (the rate of people quitting) across teams.\n\nThis is because all teams are equally exposed to the same senior leaders,\nemployee benefits and HR policies. They do not, however, all have the same\ndirect manager. But how can companies help all their managers, at all levels,\nget better at managing? In the past, the answer used to be the annual employee\nengagement survey and some mix of general leadership training.\n\nWhile such efforts are far better than no effort, the software available in\n2019 can help to supercharge the results. Josh Bersin writes that \"people\nanalytics (is) here with a vengeance\" \\- the ability to use the power of data\nto drive decision-support at the managerial level is higher than it has ever\nbeen. In fact, Deloitte has found that People Data was the top human capital\ntrend globally.\n\nThis unlocks two main capabilities to help managers: specificity and\ntimeliness.\n\n **Specificity**\n\nA problem with using data to support managers in the past was that there were\ntoo many of them. There were practical constraints around how detailed that\ndata could be, and how many managers could receive personalized results.\n\nWith analytical capabilities today, managers at all levels can get detailed\nreports on how their team has been responding to their leadership style. In\nsome applications, they can even get tailored suggestions on what actions they\nshould take to reduce the risk of their people quitting.\n\nThis simple approach to using people analytics is why such surveys are still\nthe best way of measuring and improving employee engagement, even in a\ncutting-edge technology company like Facebook.\n\n **Timeliness**\n\nThe other challenge was that while we think and act in real-time, the people\ndata that companies collected had significant time lags. Sometimes even as\nlong as every two or three years.\n\nThe key to mitigating attrition is prevention, rather than cure. That means\ngetting early warning signals of unhappiness, instead of trying to read\npatterns from exit interviews.\n\nAutomation and analytics allow for real-time sentiment monitoring of employees\ntoday. Organization network analysis draws data from employee communication:\nwho they talk to (via email or chat), when and how long each communication\nhappens, how many others they frequently contact and so on.\n\nYou can then observe patterns and act on them. For example, managers can learn\nto identify employees who are burning out and rebalance their workload.\n\nAnother means of getting timely data is through pulse surveys - short surveys\nsent frequently to employees on specific topics, with results and analysis\ndelivered in real-time. Managers can then access what their people are\nthinking, and take immediate action on any red flags before the resignation\nletter appears on their desk.\n\n **Managing across the full employee experience**\n\nTalent retention is an ongoing process and needs to be applied across the six\nmilestones of the employee experience: Onboarding, Engagement, Development,\nPerformance, Transition, and Separation.\n\nThis also needs to be cross-referenced against the employee's stage of life:\nfresh into the workforce, having young children, caring for older parents or\nrelatives, approaching retirement and others.\n\nIn 2019, companies now have the software available to do this. Having a single\nsource of truth for analysing the employee experience would be ideal, but with\nsome effort bridging data across silos is possible. The average company has\nmore than seven systems of record for people-related data after all.\n\n\n\nSo make 2019 the year that your company starts its people analytics journey,\nand enjoy being much less nervous about your best people leaving you this time\nnext year.\n\n\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

These efforts, which started in 2011, have helped save\nDBS over 600,000 manhours.\n\n###\n\n![BT_20180303_YMBRUNCH3BIP2U_3332374.jpg](/sites/default/files/styles/article_img/public/image/2018/03/03/BT_20180303_YMBRUNCH3BIP2U_3332374_0.jpg?itok=L-5aZb6V)\n\nThe Singapore Land Authority's HR team has developed a mobile app which allows\nstaff to access a range of HR services on the go, including transport claims\nsubmissions and vacation/ medical leave applications.\n\nIMAGINE if your boss could take pre-emptive measures to retain employees who\nshow signs of wanting to leave. Or if companies could get a handle on which\npotential hires would be the best fit - even before meeting them in person.\n\nSounds like the stuff of science fiction? Scenes like these are already\nplaying out at some companies in Singapore, where a technological revolution\nis underway in the usually sedate field of human resources (HR).\n\n**While HR departments** typically run on gut instinct rather than hard data,\na growing number of companies are trying to apply a data-driven approach to\nmanaging staff.\n\nData analytics can help companies decide who to hire, tailor training\nprogrammes to suit staff requirements - even predict which employees are\nlikely to leave. The data can come from a wide variety of sources, including\nemployees' leave applications, key performance indicator reports, email\ntraffic, and social networking activity.\n\nHR practitioners say \"people analytics\" - as these methods are called - have\nthe potential to create better workplaces, boost employee-employer\nrelationships and improve talent retention rates.\n\n[\n\n### SEE ALSO\n\n## Future-focused HR policy means valuing older workers too\n\n](/companies-markets/singapore-budget-2020/future-focused-hr-policy-means-\nvaluing-older-workers-too)\n\n#### Stay updated with  \nBT newsletters\n\n[Terms & conditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)\n\nSign up\n\nEven as these technologies gain popularity, however, concerns are emerging\nover the implications for employees' data privacy.\n\nHow are data and technology helping companies manage talent and retain staff?\nAnd how far should employers go in their efforts to learn more about\nemployees?\n\n**Growing interest**\n\nTech giant Google was - of course - among the pioneers in people analytics. In\na bid to \"build better bosses\", Google embarked on a plan code-named Project\nOxygen in 2009.\n\nThe data-mining giant hired statisticians to trawl through performance\nreviews, feedback surveys and nominations for top-manager awards.\n\nThis analysis yielded a list of common behaviours among the best managers:\nemployees value bosses who are good coaches, do not micromanage, and take an\ninterest in employees' lives and careers, among other characteristics.\n\nWhile the findings hardly seem earth-shattering, it made a big splash mainly\nbecause the insights were backed up by hard data - revolutionary in a field\nthat has traditionally relied mainly on intangibles. Interest in people\nanalytics has exploded in the years since.\n\nHR analytics roles in the Asia-Pacific region have more than doubled in the\npast 10 years, according to data from professional networking site LinkedIn.\nIt estimates that there are now almost 40,000 HR analytics professionals in\nthe region. And in the Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have\nthe highest penetration of data or analytics skills in HR functions, LinkedIn\ndata says. In Singapore, close to half of HR professionals are equipped with\ndata or analytics skills.\n\nCompanies are clearly starting to pay attention to the potential that\nanalytics holds for people management. Deloitte's 2017 Global Human Capital\nTrends report - which polled 10,400 business and HR leaders across 140\ncountries - found that 71 per cent of respondents see people analytics as a\nhigh priority in their organisations.\n\nRecruiting is the No 1 area of focus, followed by performance measurement,\ncompensation, workforce planning and retention, the report found.\n\n\"The types of decisions that can be made using data range from micro decisions\nlike how to recognise staff and how often, to enterprise-wide considerations\nlike whether or not to downsize a particular division and the likely impact on\nproductivity,\" says Leong Chee Tung, co-founder and chief executive of\nemployee engagement platform EngageRocket.\n\nThe startup, which has worked with companies across a range of industries\nincluding construction, food and beverage, retail and financial services, has\ndeveloped a cloud-based software which allows clients to analyse employee\nfeedback in real time.\n\nThe technology gives managers an instant snapshot into their organisation's\nhealth and allows them to take immediate action - for instance, improving\ntheir leadership styles or work environment, Mr Leong notes.\n\nCompanies can also layer information collected from these surveys on top of\nother data - for example, metadata from emails and in-company chats - to come\nup with various predictive models. These can be used to measure, for instance,\nthe likelihood of an employee leaving the company - someone with an eye on the\ndoor might take more vacation or medical leave than average, or be less\nengaged with employee training programmes.\n\n**Privacy concerns**\n\nWhile the technology enables employers to track nearly everything employees\ndo, the question that immediately arises is whether they should. Shades of Big\nBrother surface when we open the doors to surveillance of communications -\nfrom both within the office and without.\n\nHR practitioners say companies must have a clear sense of what they hope to\naccomplish when they collect employee data. They also need to be forthcoming\nand transparent in their communication with employees.\n\n\"The trust between employee and employer cannot be breached,\" says Lee Yan\nHong, head of group human resources at DBS. DBS launched a digital overhaul of\nits HR operations in 2011 and has since started using big data to boost staff\nproductivity, reduce attrition rates and recruit more effectively.\n\nAmong sales staff, for instance, the bank started tracking more than 200\nfactors - including training, leave patterns, pace and quantity of salary\nincreases - to suss out which employees are at risk of packing up and leaving.\nThose at risk are flagged to managers, who can then sit down with them to find\nout what the issues are - salary, training or even just a lack of tender\nloving care.\n\nOCBC too made a push in 2015 with similar goals - to help the bank retain\ntalent and improve its recruitment process.\n\nJason Ho, OCBC head of group human resources, notes: \"HR is seen as a function\nrelated to people and is usually based on experience and relationships. But\ndata analytics helps to enhance and validate the information we get from the\nground so it's no longer just a qualitative discussion. It's more objective\nand helps us make better decisions for colleagues in the organisation.\"\n\nOCBC uses data analytics to identify potential staff departures, customise\ntraining programmes, and make its executive recruitment process more\nefficient. The bank uses a dynamic dashboard with colours like amber and\ngreen, tracking a candidate's progress along the recruitment pipeline. The\nsystem can also identify if hiring managers are taking too long to process an\napplication or if information is missing from the candidate's application.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank uses data analytics for similar ends, and equips its HR\nstaff with basic analytics skills through training and workshops.\n\nThe bank has also created an analytics dashboard for HR staff across various\nmarkets. \"This will help them to draw insights on the status of hiring,\nattrition, performance, compensation and promotion and to help them in their\ndecision-making on the ground,\" says Jenny Wong, head of group human resources\nat UOB.\n\nFor instance, the bank's data showed that within their first two years of\nworking at UOB, many staff in Singapore who hold diplomas opt to pursue\nuniversity degrees part-time. In response, the bank introduced the UOB\nLearning Journey Programme, a job rotation plan which allows staff to take on\nnew assignments ranging from six months to a year, after which the employee\ncan choose to remain in their new role or to return to their original one.\n\n\"In addition to deepening cross-team collaboration and understanding, this\nprogramme has improved talent retention by up to 5 per cent, while lateral\ntransfers to other roles among branch employees have also doubled,\" Ms Wong\nnotes.\n\nFor these companies, the results of their \"people analytics\" show clear\nbenefits. But they are careful to point out what they are doing to address the\ncost - the potential invasion of privacy.\n\nDBS' Ms Lee notes that a significant amount of HR data - including salary and\nperformance information - is confidential and only a few are authorised to see\nit.\n\nShould the bank want to start a new project that involves closer monitoring of\nemployees, for instance, tracking their emails, permission must be sought from\nstaff, she says.\n\n\"So far, this is not something we have tried. But if we want to experiment\nwith something and look for patterns... we have to ask permission from\nemployees and explain to them what we're doing. We're very clear about that.\"\n\nOCBC's Mr Ho agrees: \"We are mindful of the sensitivity and confidentiality of\ndata. All the information we use is data that is readily available. We're not\nlooking at individual employee behaviour. Also, access to our database is\ntightly controlled and managed.\"\n\nIn addition to complying with local laws and regulations related to the\ngathering and use of employee data, employers should also take measures to\nsafeguard personal data in their possession against the risk of cyber-attacks,\nsays Mayank Parekh, Institute for Human Resource Professionals chief\nexecutive.\n\nWhen it comes to companies deciding how far they should go in monitoring or\npredicting staff behaviour, EngageRocket's Mr Leong says ethical arguments are\nstill catching up with technology.\n\n\"Where the boundary is drawn between what an employee does on company time\nversus in their personal lives is getting fuzzier than ever,\" he notes.\n\n\"I'd say that this boundary will be different for each company, but as a broad\nrule of thumb I'd say that as long as a company CEO is comfortable having the\nmonitoring measures published on the front pages of a reputable publication\nlike The Business Times, the measures are respectable and within boundaries.\"\n\n**Lack of usable data a key challenge**\n\nGiven the resources required, it comes as no surprise that financial\ninstitutions are Singapore's people analytics pioneers. In practice, however,\nmany HR departments are still struggling to implement such technologies.\nAdoption of people analytics among Singapore companies remains low, says\nVictoria Bethlehem, Asia Pacific human resources head at the Adecco Group.\n\n\"Typically, companies have some form of system in place to collect HR data for\noperational reporting. The challenge lies in shifting the focus from using the\ndata tactically, to analysing it and using it in a more strategic manner, such\nas long-term planning, driving business performance and producing predictive\nmodels,\" she notes.\n\nMany existing HR systems and tools are not geared towards gathering usable\ndata, says Mr Parekh.\n\nMs Bethlehem adds: \"At many companies, HR data is either not well captured or\nnot well managed. HR data may be incomplete, scattered, unstructured and\ndisconnected from the rest of the business data.\"\n\nMr Leong of EngageRocket says: \"Building the data infrastructure within a\ncompany isn't an easy task unless you have your own data science team in HR\nthat can harmonise the data and run analyses on it.\"\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular could find it an\nuphill task. Fion Ngiam, a lecturer at Nanyang Polytechnic's School of\nBusiness Management, says: \"Many local companies, especially the smaller\ncompanies, may still be more concerned about meeting the daily operational\ndemands, and may not have the resources and skills to implement structures to\nsupport HR analytics as this can be very time-consuming and complicated,\" she\nnotes.\n\nEven larger firms could find it challenging to make the most of their HR data.\n\"While the companies may have implemented some form of human resource\ninformation systems, they are lacking in the ability to effectively analyse\nand interpret the wealth of data residing within HR,\" Ms Ngiam says.\n\nStill, while data can be helpful, there is only so much it can do, says OCBC's\nMr Ho.\n\n\"Data lacks empathy. We cannot use only data to drive our decisions, we still\nhave to be human in the way we look at human resources.\n\n\"We can use data to improve productivity and facilitate decision making, but\nit's not the ultimate factor that we consider, it's just one reference point,\"\nhe notes.\n\n* * *\n\n**Hiring staff with the aid of a bot**\n\nA CHATBOT will soon be helping DBS screen some of the 300,000 candidates\napplying to the bank for a job every year.\n\nThe bot is just one tool DBS is employing in its bid to automate the tedious\nprocess of recruitment by using data analytics.\n\nOne of the early stages of the bank's hiring process requires candidates to\ncomplete a quiz, which susses out their personality traits and personal\nqualities. The results from this quiz - called a predictive index - are then\nmatched against an \"ideal\" profile for the role they are applying for.\nCandidates have to fit the profile before they move on to the next step in the\nhiring process.\n\nAlong the line, candidates could also be required to answer questions posed by\na chatbot from April onwards, says DBS head of group human resources Lee Yan\nHong.\n\nThe chatbot assigns scores based on their responses, as well as the\ncompetencies and work experience portions of their resumes - for instance,\nwhether or not they have founded a startup.\n\nThis push to automate hiring is part of a wider overhaul of the bank's\napproach to HR, Ms Lee says. These efforts, which started in 2011, have helped\nsave DBS over 600,000 manhours, she adds. The bank's HR team now includes four\ndata scientists.\n\nOne of the biggest initial challenges was creating a \"data lake\" - a massive\ncollection of employee data used as the foundation for all HR analytics\nprojects. \"The process took a year and was very painful,\" says Ms Lee.\n\nThe \"lake\" includes data on employee compensation and benefits, demographic\ndata such as marital status and children's ages, as well as data on\nperformance and day-to-day operations like the number of calls made by\nsalespeople.\n\nThe bank has since collected 700 data points on each of its 10,000 employees\nin Singapore and hopes to complete similar endeavours in all of its other\nmarkets by this year.\n\nIts first big-data model in 2014, code-named Project Marvel, helped identify\nproblems - and potential outcomes - among a particular group of sales staff.\nFor example, those who take frequent leave in the early months of the job are\nlikely to quit, as are those who are not driven to take up more training.\n\nThe study also found that sales targets were pitched too high - which\ndiscouraged some new joiners - and that staff were taking longer than the\nthree-month probation period to settle into their new roles.\n\nIn response, changes were made to the recruitment and candidate screening\nprocess. The probation period for sales staff was also extended to six months\nand sales targets were made more achievable.\n\nFollowing the success of its early data science projects, Ms Lee's department\nwill be delving deeper into details - for instance, aiming to improve\nretention among employees from polytechnics, the segment with the highest\nturnover rates.\n\nBut using data to identify a potential problem is only the start. The real\nchallenge lies in implementing solutions, Ms Lee says.\n\n\"Operationalising and deploying is the difficult part,\" she notes. Some\nmanagers were hesitant about the predictive index, for example, because they\ndidn't think they needed to use big data to hire the right people.\n\n\"But when they saw that those who did not pass the predictive index all\neventually left, they were convinced.\n\n\"Change management is not easy, we need to distil it down to a story, so\npeople know how it impacts them and what they need to do.\"\n\n* * *\n\n**Public sector gets into the act**\n\nTECHNOLOGY is revolutionising human resources not just in the business world\nbut also in the public sector.\n\nThe Singapore Land Authority (SLA), for instance, has turned to drones and\nvirtual reality (VR) to give its recruitment efforts a boost.\n\nIn a bid to draw crowds to the statutory board's booths at recruitment events,\nits HR department used drones and VR technology to create a video clip\nshowcasing three of the state properties it manages.\n\n\"SLA doesn't usually ring a bell with the man on the street because the work\nwe do doesn't really touch many people on the ground, so we wanted to give a\nunique experience to the people who visit our booth during career roadshows,\"\nsays director of human resources Er Chye Har.\n\nThe video clip is viewed through a VR headset. A total of 500 VR headsets have\nbeen made. The 2016 project was a HR team effort and cost less than S$5,000 in\ntotal.\n\n\"The vendors we approached were surprised that they got a call from HR -\nusually it's marketing that will produce such videos,\" says Ms Er. \"The first\ntime we brought the VR headset out, it drew a lot of crowds to our recruitment\nbooth, which motivated us to do more tech-related projects.\"\n\nSLA's HR team has also launched a number of other tech-related projects,\nincluding a mobile app game in 2016 used to induct and train new staff. New\njoiners play games on the app to learn about the organisation, and the games\nearn them points which can be redeemed for rewards and prizes.\n\n\"As we implement these technologies we are also mindful that we should not\nlose the human touch,\" notes Ms Er. \"Our HR induction programmes are high tech\nbut also high touch. We incorporate some segments which require face-to face-\ninteraction.\"\n\nFor instance, one game in the app calls for new hires to take photos with\nmembers of the management team.\n\nIn 2016, SLA's HR team also developed a separate mobile app which allows staff\nto access a range of HR services on the go, including transport claims\nsubmissions and vacation/medical leave applications.\n\nThe range of services available on the app will keep growing, Ms Er says. The\napp is also being scaled up to benefit other agencies in the public sector.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  *

The\npercentage more than doubles (38%) for those who are planning to stay for two\nyears at most.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

This is vital, experts said, as businesses\nadapt to industry disruptions and a more manpower-lean environment.\n\n\"SMEs (small and medium- sized enterprises) that need to be quick and lean\nshould harness technology to manage their people processes and costs,\" said\nSpring Singapore's group director for human capital and capabilities\nChristophane Foo.\n\nHR technology was highlighted by Second Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo as\none of the areas under the new HR Industry Manpower Plan launched on July 10.\n\nAt the basic level, using technology to streamline administrative work, like\npayroll processing, frees HR staff for more strategic work.\n\nThey can use the time saved to explore other areas of the business, said\nSingapore Human Resources Institute president Erman Tan. For instance, if they\nunderstand how disruptive technology will impact the business and lead to\nretrenchment, they can train staff ahead for the new technology.\n\n![About 90 per cent of Ademco Security Group's business processes will be\nstored on remote servers in the cloud by the year end.

An applicant tracking system, like ManpowerGroup's Roma,\ncan sieve through job applications and build a database of talent for the\norganisation's future manpower needs, she added.\n\nEducators have noticed the shift too. Private school PSB Academy is reviewing\nits HR management curriculum to include wearable technology and big data\nanalytics, which can be used to improve talent acquisition and training, said\nits School of Business and Management lecturer Salitha Nair Subramaniam.\n\nWearable tech can shed light on the health challenges of the workforce, she\nadded.\n\nAs awareness of HR technology grows, larger solutions providers such as\nsoftware company Sage and data analytics firm Tableau, as well as local HR\ntech start-ups, are rising to meet demand.\n\nAnother example is employee engagement platform EngageRocket, which gathers\nand analyses employee feedback for clients. The start-up's co-founder and\nchief executive Leong Chee Tung said more than 70 companies have signed up in\nthe last nine months.\n\n\"Technology can create in real time the same level of analytics,\nsophistication and scientific rigour to managing people as is already applied\nto managing finance and customers,\" he said.\n\nCashback shopping platform ShopBack has been using EngageRocket's services to\nsurvey its 120 employees on staff engagement, said Mr Alex Teo, who oversees\nShopBack's people operations.\n\nShopBack has saved about 25 per cent of time taken to gather feedback, he\nadded.\n\nCompanies keen to use HR technology can apply for Spring's Capability\nDevelopment Grant, or use its shared services scheme to outsource their HR\noperations to service providers.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non July 18, 2017, with the headline 'Technology changing the face of HR\nindustry'.

enables employees to be heard at work\n\nThe engagement platform with anonymous, crowdsourced employee listening aims\nto help employers to listen to their employees at scale on a real-time basis.\nRead on to know more about Hyphen's journey, which was a participant at last\nyear's TechHR Startup program.\n\n![How engagement startup Hyphen enables employees to be heard at\nwork](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1528173031/1528172896.jpg)\n\nIt is a fact that most of the startup ideas spring out of a brainstorming\nsession over a beer. So is the case with employee engagement platform Hyphen,\nco-founded by Ranjit Jose and Arnaud Grunwald. Both Ranjit and Arnaud, in\ntheir previous jobs, saw frustration building up in large teams as the growing\nsize of the company made it difficult for employees to reach to the\nmanagement. Or in other words, difficult for the employees to voice out\ncontroversial opinions or feedback without feeling threatened.\n\nSo the duo approached the HR department with a proposal to conduct a survey to\nfind out what their teams were thinking about and how could changes be made to\naddress issues. But they were held back by the classic response of an\napproaching annual survey in the six months and hence the suggestion to find\nout at that point in time.\n\n> Says Ranjit, \"At that point, we thought that there has to be a better way in\n> which employees of a company can put out ideas, feedback, suggestions which\n> the whole company can crowd source on and let the best ideas come to the\n> top.\"\n\nIt is then the duo concurred that the best way to get this information was to\nenable the employees to speak up themselves rather than falling back on the\nclassic structure of asking them. Thus was born Hyphen in 2015-an engagement\nplatform with anonymous, crowdsourced employee listening with real-time\ninsights and people analytics for the HR and management.\n\nThe idea was simple-allow organizations to hear their employees. As\norganizations get larger, employees think twice before putting out a\ncontroversial suggestion. It is thus important to ensure that employees are\nable to do it anonymously.\n\n### How does the Hyphen product help managers listen in real time\n\nIn bigger organizations, it becomes difficult for them to get a quick sense of\nwhat is important to people. And people are an organization's most important\nassets. To retain the best people, an employer needs to foster an environment\nwhere employees feel that their opinions matter.\n\nSo Hyphen is helping organizations to listen to their people in real time\nrather than in once a year top down surveys. For instance one of their\ncustomers Titan, on a weekly basis can know what their people care about. Thus\norganizations can listen at scale on a real-time basis.\n\nHow Hyphen enables this is through its four different offerings. The offerings\ninclude engagement surveys and quick surveys which can be done in a more\nnimble, mobile-based way.  The Smart Insights offering is about employee life\ncycle and experience - for instance, their views on how convenient the\nonboarding experience is. Through Pulse Polls, an employer can roll out or\npulse out questions once a week to get a quick sense of what employees are\nthinking across the company. In the fourth module Employee Voice, employees\nget to give their ideas, suggestions, anonymously allowing companies to\ncrowdsource them.\n\n![hyphen ](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_650/v1522927402/Hyphen_5_cn3qhv.jpg)\n\n### Enabling the augmented manager\n\nThe startup claims that the depth of analytics it provides is a key\ndifferentiator for it. Additionally, the startup also makes it easy for\nmanagers and top management to look at the information in a more dynamically\ningrained fashion than relying on static reports. It also adds that the UI is\nextremely seamless from the mobile perspective.\n\nAs the industry matures and grows, Hyphen is betting on more and more\ncompanies getting into an active listening mode to listen to their employees.\nWith its real-time and advanced analytics, the startup hopes to gain a bigger\nshare of the market. In the pipeline, are plans to build on the inbuilt AI and\nML capabilities and double down on the real-time sentiment analysis piece.\n\nThe startup's vision is what it calls enabling \"the augmented manager\". It\nbelieves managers will be increasingly expected to be good leaders and Hyphen\nwants to help them on a real-time basis.\n\nOver the course of the last three years, the startup which follows a\nsubscription-based monetization model has amassed customers in the US,\nstartups in the Bay area, and many renowned names such as Hero MotoCorp, Rio\nTinto, Ola, Titan, InMobi, Epsilon, Dollar Shave Club and Dr. Lal Path Labs\namong others.\n\n![hyphen](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_650/v1522927140/Capture_a6lbuu.png)\n\n> Ashish Sinha, Country Head (India) Epsilon stated, \"Hyphen has changed the\n> way we listen to our associates and the speed at which we, the management\n> can take action. The many real-time insights that we have collected in just\n> a few months have had a positive impact on our teams and have been at the\n> origin of initiatives that we believe can materially improve employee\n> engagement and retention.\"\n\n### Hyphen and the crowding employee engagement market\n\nAs per Deloitte Consulting LLP, the [HR technology\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-technology/a-look-at-the-indian-hr-\ntech-funding-and-acquisitions-jan-march-2018-17873)marketplace is a $400\nbillion market globally. It is estimated that Indian firms can save at least\n$600 million annually with HR tech.\n\nNo wonder there is increasing demand for tech products in all facets of the HR\nfunction-be it recruitment, engagement, or learning and development. In light\nof this, many startups have sprung up in the space. For instance, HR tech\nstartup inFeedo with its product Amber, is one such startup leveraging the\npower of AI in HR to improve employee experience/engagement. Similarly, there\nis nFactorial which addresses the engagement challenge with products like\nn!Gage, which is a continuous employee feedback platform that allows managers\nto get real-time data and insights about what their employees are feeling.\n\nThere are many international players in the employee engagement space as well\nsuch as Canada based PostBeyond, which works on in-bound engagement, and\nAustralia based employee engagement and recognition platform WooBoard. Then\nthere is Singapore based startup EngageRocket which provides bite-sized action\nplans to guide managers to improve leadership style by analyzing employee\nfeedback in real-time.\n\nIn the midst of this growing competition, how far will Hyphen's product be\nable to differentiate and scale will be the real determinant of its success.\nWhile engaging employees by listening to them is in vogue now, the real\nquestion is-how many companies will bank upon Hyphen hear their employees out?\nThat will be something to watch out for.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee Engagement](/category/compensation-\nperformance/employee-engagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-\nengagement \"Browse more in: Employee Engagement\"), [HR\nTechnology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#HRTechMarket](/tag/hr-tech-\nmarket?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-tech-market \"Browse more in:\nHRTechMarket\"), [#EmployeeEngagementIdeas](/tag/employee-engagement-\nideas?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-engagement-ideas \"Browse\nmore in: EmployeeEngagementIdeas\"),\n[#TechHR2018](/tag/techhr-2018?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=techhr-2018\n\"Browse more in: TechHR2018\"), [#TechHRStartup](/tag/techhr-\nstartup?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=techhr-startup \"Browse more in:\nTechHRStartup\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

This includes disruptions to Hong Kong's transportation\ninfrastructure and an increase in crime rates since the protests began,\" noted\nQuane.\n\nAs a result, Seoul and Taipei have overtaken Hong Kong in the rankings.\nMeanwhile, Thai and Vietnamese cities also continued to rise.\n\nAustralian cities also saw drops in the rankings after livability scores\nworsened in every location. However, all seven Australian cities in the list\nstill feature in the top 30 destinations for East Asian workers.\n\n**Also read:**  [Singapore expat pay package hit $325,000 in\n2018](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/singapore-expat-pay-package-\nhit-325000-in-2018)\n\nCopenhagen in Denmark remains the most liveable city for East Asian expats\noutside of the APAC region. Cities in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and\nSwitzerland were particularly hailed for their transportation system, high\nstandard of healthcare and stability.\n\nMeanwhile, US cities were a mixed bag, with New York and San Francisco rising\nin the rankings as the number of violent crimes dropped in recent years;\nwhilst Boston fell in the rankings as its booming economy meant that there is\ngreater competition for housing available for expats.\n\nECA's Location Ratings system assesses the overall quality of living in over\n490 locations globally. Factors assessed include climate; availability of\nhealth services; housing and utilities; natural phenomena; isolation; access\nto a social network and leisure facilities; infrastructure; personal safety;\npolitical tensions; and air quality.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/SG-HK-expats.jpg)\n\nDo you know more about this story?

\n\n![](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/600x360/news/Singapore\nbuildings at night_1.jpg)\n\n# Startups boost HR tech momentum in Singapore\n\nWill you hire bots to interview potential employees?\n\nAlthough future-proofing the workforce remains a key component of Singapore's\nnational digital blueprint, the broad-based digitalisation drive has not\nspared recruiters responsible for the unenviable task of managing the city\nstate's limited human resources that remain crucial to achieving the city's\nvision.\n\nAmidst the Lion City's chronic manpower problems, human resources technology\n(HR tech) which could range from chatbots to data-driven employee technologies\nto the automation of administrative labour like evaluations systems, talent\nrequest and onboarding process, hold the promise that could easily pave the\nway for the future of work.\n\n**Also read** : [Can tech solve Singapore's talent and manpower\ncrunch?](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/in-focus/can-tech-solve-singapores-\ntalent-and-manpower-crunch)\n\nOne such startup disrupting the local HR space is\n[PeopleWave](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/exclusive/hr-software-startup-\npeoplewave-strengthens-funding-stream-500000-seed-round), whose products\ninclude a data-driven employee appraisal system and dashboard displaying an\norganisation's performance as it aims to capitalise on the growing recognition\nof the business value of data-driven people management and analytics.\n\n\"CEOs and HR leaders have long embraced new technology but it's only now that\nHR tech is catching up,\" **Damien Cummings** , Peoplewave CEO told _Singapore\nBusiness Review_. \"Marketers are data-driven and sales leaders are using\nSalesforce but HR hasn't had the same level of tool, until now.\"\n\nOver the past five years, capital injections into global HR tech startups have\nbeen steadily growing from US$413m in 2012 to a record US$2.22b in 2016,\naccording to market intelligence platform CB Insights.\n\nOn the local level, Singapore's HR tech market is trailing slightly behind US\nand other Western countries as it's still in the process of moving away from\ncompliance-driven tools including payroll and leave management towards tools\nthat are able to provide actionable insights and make HR more of a business\nfunction, observed Cummings.\n\n**Also read** : [DBS rolls out virtual bank\nrecruiter](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-services/news/dbs-rolls-out-virtual-\nbank-recruiter)\n\nArmed with curated workforce insights, companies are therefore able to make\ninformed decisions on recruitment, employee assessment, workforce planning,\n[employee engagement and retention](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/chart-day-expected-turnover-rate-in-singapore-highest-in-asia).\n\n\"Given the business friendliness of Singapore, many HR tech players [have]\ncome in and they help to drive the vibrancy of the ecosystem,\" according to\n**Adrian Tan** , co-founder of HR consultancy firm The Resource Group, who\nforecasted that a more solid usage of AI beyond chatbots is set to overtake\nthe prevailing trend of data-powered analytics for predictive reasons over the\nnext few years.\n\nThe application of blockchain technology is also another developing trend in\nthe HR tech scene, observed ManpowerGroup Singapore country manager  **Linda\nTeo** , especially as the distributed ledger technology enables companies to\nverify credentials in a more credible and secure manner.\n\nIndorse is one such startup as it [leverages on

Unlike traditional social media platforms,\nhowever, where users can make any claim regarding their skills set or work\nexperience, Indorse members need to attach proof of their claim which will\nthen be 'indorsed' or verified by other users in the same domain.\n\n**Defying disruption**  \nSingapore has been globally recognised as the third most prepared country for\nthe wave of intelligent automation, trailing only behind South Korea and\nGermany in The Economist's Automation Readiness Index.\n\nBeyond [periodic skills upgrading](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/participation-in-work-related-learning-jumped-48-in-2018)\nthrough the governments SkillsFuture programme, the Lion City is also actively\ntapping on disruptive technologies like AI and robotics to future-proof all\naspects of business against the [threat of disruption](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/more-news/half-singapore-workers-threatened-digitalisation-will-\nsnatch-their-jobs) including its most valuable asset - human resources.\n\nMuch of the interest in adopting HR tech largely comes from the startup sector\nwhere manpower and resource are a common issue hampering growth, according to\nEngageRocket founder CEO **CheeTung Leong** whose firm automates the\nadministration and analytics behind employee surveys to analyse employee\nfeedback in real-time.\n\n\"Generally well-funded startup are early adopters, followed by foreign MNCs,\nlocal banks, SME with 2nd/3rd gen owners, local MNCS, SMEs with original\nowners in this exact sequence,\" echoed Tan.\n\nWith the ongoing digitisation of the bulk of HR work, are recruiters at risk\nof being displaced by chatbots and predictive analytics too? Analysts believe\nthis won't be the case as much of the recruitment and employee assessment work\nis still hinged on the importance of human judgment and expertise although\nPeoplewave's Cummings believes that the model is likely to be nimbler and\nwould feature more subscription models, software license fees and consulting\nengagements in the future.\n\n\"It's in a company's best interest to have an all-round approach that does not\nonly include the latest technologies, but also prioritises the human expertise\nthat recruitment consultants provide,\" said Robert Half Singapore managing\ndirector **Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard**. \"There is just no substitute for real-\nworld interaction and human judgements when it comes to finding and securing\nthe right talent.\"\n\nAlthough digital recruiters could be used to perform the screening process for\na bulk of entry-level jobs, senior roles that attract a niche talent pool\ncannot be filtered and judged by a bot as such tasks still need the handling\nof an experienced HR manager.\n\n\"Within the HR function, firms have been mindful of the extent to which they\nshould automate or digitise this function,\" according to **Shinjika Shukla** ,\nassociate director, Michael Page Singapore. \"In situations such as employee\ngrievances, employee interaction with chatbots may not solve the purpose.\"\n\nIn fact, a survey by the ManpowerGroup Solutions reveals that almost a fifth\n(19%) of jobseekers still opt for in-person interviews, indicating that\ncandidates still place premium on face-to-face meetings despite the pool of\navailable technology.\n\n\"As important as it has been for organisations to implement technology\nsolutions within their HR functions, employers are mindful that this function\nrequires human touch points from time to time without which it may lose its\neffectiveness,\" Shukla added.\n\nIn order to keep pace with Singapore's smart vision targets, recruitment teams\nhave actually been forging closer partnerships with HR tech players so that\nthey are able to direct their energies towards higher value types of work.\n\n\"HR teams are actively looking at how AI assistants can play an active role in\nthe recruitment process from initial candidate filtering all the way to the\ninterview, offer and on-boarding process,\" according to **Lee Jin Hian** ,\nfounder & CEO, Evie.ai, an AI-powered assistant that can be used to schedule\nmeetings and interviews, track to-do lists and book meeting rooms.\n\nTime and cost also continue to drive the business priorities of HR managers\nand only through such collaborations with tech players will they be able to\nmeet business targets and withstand the digital disruption.\n\n\"The smartest recruitment networks are investing in or collaborating with HR\ntech vendors. Whilst it's not mainstream yet, within the next 2 years all\ncandidates will be using agency endorsed software for applying to new jobs,\ngoing through background assessment, preparing for their first day on the job\nand being managed through their first 100 days in the new role,\" said\nCummings.\n\nWith consulting firm Korn Ferry estimating Singapore to be amongst those\npoised to be the [hardest hit by a global talent\nshortage](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/singapore-could-\nlose-14251b-talent-crunch), any solution that could give recruiters more time\nto look for value-adding candidates in a shrinking talent pool is a welcome\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, companies need to forge greater industry ties in order to avoid\nredundant HR tech solutions, suggested The Resource Group's Tan. \"Singapore\nbusiness will only stand to benefit from the myriad of new choices. But the\nmarket is still small. This require deeper collaboration between providers to\nintegrate with each other so that customers need not remember 10 logins to\nsolve 10 problems.\"\n\nDo you know more about this story?

These rapid response skills have become key to\nbusiness survival. Faced with constant change, companies have had to evolve\nand adapt more than ever before. Hence the widespread use of \"agile\",\n\"innovate\", and \"collaborate\" in corporate shop talk. But while companies big\nand small are taking steps towards change, their ability to actually change\ncould be hamstrung by the structure of the company itself, say management\nconsultants.\n\nMost businesses are vertical or hierarchical organisations, where instructions\nare passed from the top of the pyramid down towards the bottom. Such\nstructures have little feedback flow from ground to senior brass, and create a\nhigh-control, low-autonomy environment which is more likely to discourage\nmoves to change. That corporate culture also no longer sits well with a\nworkforce that has changed both in demographic and in expectations.\n\nSays Johnson Chng, managing partner (Asia) at Danish consultancy QVARTZ: \"The\nmillennial generation of workers are well-educated and are full of ideas, but\nare not as keen to merely take instructions from superiors as previous\ngenerations.\n\n\"Instead, they want opportunities and platforms for their opinions to help or\nprovide direction for their companies.\"\n\nCan companies and societies, often tied to a legacy of vertical structures and\nhierarchical culture, take a page off the Nordic management and business\nleadership model - which is renowned for its flat and egalitarian structure\nand its ability to stay agile - to cope better in a fast changing economy?\n\n#### Stay updated with  \nBT newsletters\n\n[Terms & conditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)\n\nSign up\n\nMr Chng thinks so: \"This is where businesses can adopt the Nordic way of doing\nthings, and I believe this will bring in a lot of value for companies in Asia\nand Singapore, too.\"\n\n**The Nordic way**\n\nNordic economies can be characterised as being small, open economies which are\nfocused on international trade, and are key members of global markets. This\nhas often led to a style of doing business that promotes adaptability. Much of\nthis stems from the Scandinavian way of life.\n\nFor all the chilly weather and harsh winters, the countries of the Nordics\nhave consistently ranked among the world's happiest places. In the 2019 World\nHappiness Report released in March by the United Nations' Sustainable\nDevelopment Solutions Network, five of the top 10 spots in the annual survey\nwere held by Nordic countries - Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Sweden.\n\nCitizens in these countries enjoy a high quality of life with higher levels of\nsafety, affordable childcare and healthcare, and free education, and do not\nmind the high tax rates that are required to keep the system sustainable. Even\nmigrants to these countries polled were as satisfied with life as locals.\n\nThis has much to do with the egalitarian nature of their society, which feeds\ninto the Nordic management style. It is built off the need to compromise and\ndesire to balance its various interests between different actors in the labour\nmarket.\n\nWhile there are varying degrees as to how this is practised among Nordic\ncountries, one common theme stands out.\n\nThe organisational structure, which is how a business delineates lines of\ncommunication, policies, authority and responsibility of its staff, is mostly\nflat or horizontal.\n\nEmployees are given the authority by management to implement their own ideas\nin their areas of expertise, and their own ways of carrying them out as long\nas they produce a desirable outcome for the firm and employee performance is\nmaintained at a high level. This dissolves barriers between the executive and\nstaff levels within a firm, removing what tends to be a shortcoming of more\nvertical organisations.\n\nThe leader listens to all employees when making and implementing decisions,\nrather than emphasising personal authority.\n\nAs Hans Henrik Beck, founder and global managing partner of QVARTZ, says: \"A\nlot of companies talk about agility and the ability to act fast and be\nresponsive to changes but in order to do that, companies cannot afford to have\none person having the final say, but instead, many take the lead.\"\n\nBusiness leaders stress the organisation's dependence on the capabilities of\ntheir employees.\n\n\"Even though the CEO has the final say on decisions, he/she still needs to\ndelegate the work to those best positioned to solve specific issues or\nproblems,\" Mr Beck explains.\n\nFor example, from a customer service perspective, empowering front-facing\ncustomer officers can lead to better initiatives to improve customer\nsatisfaction, he says.\n\n\"They (customer service officers) deal with customers on a daily basis and\nactually know the customer specific situation better than the head of\ndepartment, who in turn, knows more than the CEO,\" Mr Beck adds.\n\n**Teamwork and collaboration**\n\nYet, while this empowers and encourages individuals to step up and take\ncharge, the Nordic style has no place for maverick employees. It relies\nheavily on embracing teamwork and reaching consensus. It is underpinned by the\nlaw of Jante, a code of conduct that in fact does not encourage doing things\nout of the ordinary, and holds the success of the team as more important than\nindividual achievement. In other words, it's ok to be average and one can find\nhappiness in doing so.\n\nTasks in Nordic businesses are carried out in small autonomous groups, where\nstaff of different levels of experience are each seen as equally valued\ncontributors to a project.\n\nThis fosters an environment of teamwork, collaboration and exchange of ideas\nbetween staff from different departments in a firm. Research has shown such\nset-ups work best because employees are given ownership and accountability.\n\nIn the Nordic model, these teams rely on all contributing members and are able\nto quickly identify and acknowledge when a member of the team needs support.\n\nThe flatter model could also suit a younger workforce. In an article, the Ivey\nBusiness Journal found millennials - skilled in technology, energetic, self-\nconfident, able to multi-task - to have high expectations for themselves, and\nhave a preference for working in teams rather than as individuals.\n\n**Who's the boss?**\n\nWhat then is the role of the leader in such organisations?\n\nWithin the Nordic management model, the head is one who encourages co-\noperation and is more of a facilitator within the organisation, as opposed to\none that directs business units to achieve results.\n\nThis contrasts with more top-down corporate structures where demands to meet\nquotas or key performance indicators (KPIs) can lead to competition among\nbusiness units, which may not be for the overall benefit of the company,\nespecially in a quickly evolving environment.\n\n\"When you look at real organisations, having a clear hierarchy within your\nfirm actually makes people turn on each other when they face an outside\nthreat,\" said Lindred Greer, a professor of organisational behaviour from the\nStanford Graduate School of Business, in an Insights by Stanford Business\narticle in 2017.\n\nEffective teamwork against such threats requires not hierarchy but\negalitarianism and not a centralised power structure but a consensus-based\napproach to tackling issues, Prof Greer said.\n\nQVARTZ's Mr Beck adds: \"It has to be a two-way street, where leaders are not\nonly engaging staff by brain, but also by heart.\n\n\"If you interact with people on an intellectual level, then you will only have\na very transactional relationship. But if leaders also engage by heart, you\nwill have a more rewarding and trust-based relationship.\"\n\nThe business leader's role, then, is to identify a long-term direction for the\nfirm, and be flexible to adapting to changes, with staff charting how they\nintend to get the firm there.\n\nThis also represents a departure from the paternalistic role that leaders in\nvertical organisations - and in Asia and the developing world - take on.\n\nAs Prof Greer says, vertical organisations that adopt a more horizontal\nframework are not only likely to keep employees happy, but also enhance\nperformance and benefit the bottom line.\n\n**Other benefits**\n\nAccording to data covering 13 markets in the Asia-Pacific, human resources\nanalytics firm EngageRocket found that more than 50 per cent of companies that\nscored high levels of satisfaction with the degree of autonomy came from the\n\"new tech\" industry: technology startups hiring a large proportion of\nemployees who are millennials.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, were companies from more traditional\nindustries, with closer to 20 per cent of employees expressing dissatisfaction\nwith the degree of autonomy.\n\n\"There wasn't a specific industry that stood out, but there was almost no\nrepresentation from the 'new tech' companies the this end of the spectrum,\nsuggesting that a flatter management structure that delivers more autonomy to\nemployees appeals actually not just to millennials, but across the board to\nemployees of all generations,\" notes EngageRocket co-founder and chief\nexecutive officer (CEO) Leong Chee Tung.\n\nThe egalitarian nature of Nordic culture has also had a positive effect on the\ncorporate governance of firms.\n\nMak Yuen Teen, associate professor of accounting and former vice dean of the\nNUS Business School, National University of Singapore, points to Nordic\ncountries having a lower ratio between the CEO remuneration and average\nemployee remuneration.\n\n\"About 15 years ago, I spent two weeks in Denmark visiting business schools\nthere, and was told something I have never heard before - CEOs there may be\nembarrassed if they are paid too much relative to their average employees!\" he\nremarks.\n\nThe Nordic culture has meant that employee representation on boards are better\nthan in Asia, and there is also a higher percentage of women on boards.\n\nProfessor Mak says: \"Since corporate governance is about being willing to\nconstructively challenge viewpoints, I think an egalitarian society is more\nconducive to corporate governance.\"\n\nHowever, while he has found that in past research, egalitarian culture tends\nto be associated with higher country governance scores, he adds that \"we\nshould be cautious about reading too much into simple correlations\".\n\n**A leaderless democracy?**\n\nWith an egalitarian style of business leadership comes its criticisms.\n\nCritics have said that this style of leadership is akin to a \"leaderless\ndemocracy\" as there is no centralised decision making structure. Vertical\norganisations, in contrast, have a well-defined chain of command.\n\nAnd while autonomy certainly adds to staff satisfaction and builds morale, the\nconsensus-based approach means that employees are often entitled to their\nopinions on how issues and projects should be tackled. This may slow the speed\nat which decisions are taken.\n\nQVARTZ's Mr Beck says: \"In the Nordics, staff have the right to an opinion on\nmany matters, which may mean that a lot of time is spent on deciding how to\nproceed or make progress on resolution to make a decision.\"\n\nThis, Mr Beck adds, can also be a hindrance to how fast a firm can react to\nthreats.\n\nIn this sense, firms with a more rigid and vertical structure benefit as\ndecisions can be taken quickly to reach to changes in the business\nenvironment.\n\nProfessor Mak elaborates: \"Where the environment changes rapidly for example,\nspeed in decision-making is the key and a more collaborative style may be less\nsuitable, while if the environment is highly complex, then perhaps a more\ncollaborative style which takes into account different viewpoints makes more\nsense.\"\n\nThere is too, a larger context that determines whether a flatter model works.\nProf Mak notes that leadership styles are usually representative of the\nsocietal nature. \"In societies that are more hierarchical in nature - like\nmany Asian societies - the business leadership/management style also tends to\nbe more hierarchical in nature,\" he says.\n\nTherefore, both management and staff may be more attuned to vertical\norganisational behaviour.\n\nMr Beck notes that respect for authority in the region is strong, and that can\nbe powerful as staff are usually willing to accept a leader's decision.\n\nIn fact, QVARTZ's Mr Chng points out that senior management from companies in\nAsia has expressed wanting to adopt flatter structures but notes that there\ncould be difficulty getting the work force to adopt a new style.\n\nUltimately, businesses operating in different parts of the world need to look\nat their own societal and organisation structure and identify what their\ninherent strengths are, Mr Beck says.\n\nIn The Horizontal Organization, author Frank Ostroff believes that companies\nwill become more horizontal than vertical as the world globalises. Yet, as Mr\nOstroff points out, no business should be strictly a horizontal or vertical\nstructure, but should instead, adopt the best elements of each.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  * [nordic management style](/keywords/nordic-management-style)\n  * [flat

experience,\naccording to a news release.\n\nDesigned and managed by SP students, the concept involved 40 lecturers and\nstudents from different schools where they participated in a design workshop\nto determine the features suitable for the needs of polytechnic students. UOB\ngave the students free reign on the aesthetic and functional elements of the\nbranch.\n\nUOB, along with tech firm SenseTime, also installed a digital wall within the\nbranch that uses artificial intelligence (AI) for social engagement, the first\nSingaporean bank to do so.\n\nSP students from the School of Business will manage the branch under the\nsupervision of the bank. They will undergo a 22-week stint in which they will\nbe trained in branch operations, customer experience, and risk and compliance.\nBranch interns will assist students who will apply for UOB's financial\nsolutions online.  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?

minister, Josephine Teo in a Committee of Supply debate.\n\nThe EP minimum qualifying salary was last raised in 2017 from $3,300 to $3,600\nper month.\n\nThe increase is in line with MOM's objective to improve the wages of fresh\ngraduates from local autonomous universities.\n\nThe salary criteria for older and more experienced EP candidates will be\nraised in tandem. Teo noted that this helps ensure a level playing field for\nexperienced local mid-career PMETs.\n\nTeo also advised that following the changes, employers should continue to\nensure that they have fair and merit-based pay practices, in line with the\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.\n\n\"We have heard of firms that only raise salaries of the EP holders to meet new\nsalary criteria, whilst freezing salaries of the local workers, even if the\nlocal workers are better performers. This is wrong, and not in the employer's\nbest interest,\" said Teo.\n\nThe new salary criteria will apply to new EP applicants from 1 May 2020.\n\nThose looking to renew their EP will have to apply one year later, from 1 May\n2021.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

An [estimated 66% of\ncompanies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2017/05/05/only-22-of-\ncompanies-are-getting-good-results-from-their-employee-engagement-\nsurvey/#463946896374) survey their people regularly. Yet, in their 2017 global\nstudy, Gallup finds that [only 15% of\nemployees](http://news.gallup.com/reports/220313/state-global-\nworkplace-2017.aspx) are engaged at work.\n\nWhy this big disconnect?\n\nPut aside the usual friction that may be encountered by any company\ninitiative: poor communication of intent, unclear goals, declining management\nemphasis over time, and others. Employee engagement, with the associated\nannual cycle of measurement through a survey, is an initiative doomed to fail.  \n\n**Employee Engagement - As Commonly Experienced**\n\nThe lip service paid to employee engagement is rarely matched by consistent\naction. The graph below examines a \u2018best practice\u2019 cycle of an employee\nengagement programme which would look similar to the [process recommended by\nthe National Business Research Institute](https://www.nbrii.com/employee-\nsurvey-white-papers/the-importance-of-the-annual-employee-survey/).\n\nFigure 1 - Annual Surveys\n\nEngageRocket\n\nThis is a process adopted by more than 70% of companies we have studied in\nAsia Pacific. A company takes about two months to prepare for the survey,\nanother three or four months to process the analyses and gather qualitative\nopinions before spending one more month deciding what to do with the results.\nBy the time an \"Action Plan\" is developed by the average manager (if at all),\nthey're usually anywhere from four to six months after the survey had\nconcluded.\n\nAll of this effort is made, ostensibly to get a handle on data about the\n\u201ccomplexities of the myriad of organizational dynamics that act so powerfully\non employee perceptions and drive their behavior.\u201d\n\n**Disengaging With Data**\n\nThe reality is, for the average manager, the survey is an unwelcome aberration\nto their \"business-as-usual\" (BAU) baseline. They track what directly affects\nhow their performance is measured: number of widgets produced, the yield on\nmaterials used, safety incidents, project milestones, budget, and others.\nTherefore, the steps they take directly impact some or all of these numbers.\nThey don't base their plans on 6-month-old survey data.\n\nPeter Drucker is widely believed to have said \u201cwhat gets measured gets done.\u201d\nOrganizational habit is driven by the operational metrics chosen by leaders.\nThese operational metrics are tracked on a daily, weekly, monthly, or even\nquarterly basis.\n\nShutterstock\n\nEmployee engagement programmes in these companies require a significant\ninvestment of energy because they fall outside the regular operating\nparameters of leaders. Well-intentioned leaders who do make an effort are\nforced to wait months for the next survey, without knowing whether their\nactions were successful or not.\n\nHuggy Rao and Robert Sutton discuss how companies can scale excellence by\nmanaging the [\u201ccognitive load\u201d of an\norganization](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/hayagreeva-rao-robert-\nsutton-how-do-you-scale-excellence). While collecting employee engagement data\nis important in helping leaders motivate their teams better, the load created\nmay not always be worth the insight generated. It also can create a drag on\nproductivity as capacity that could be used in alternative programs is\nchanneled towards the administrative burden of running surveys.\n\n**Avoiding The Data Disengagement Spiral**\n\nIt is tempting in many companies to see the above unfold and decide that\n\n  1. Employee surveys don\u2019t work, and we\u2019ll stop doing them; or\n  2. We know the results don\u2019t work but we need to tick that box every year\n\nIn both cases, leaders are forced to rely purely on their own instincts and\nprior experience in managing their teams.\n\nThere is a better way.\n\nIt is now possible to repeatedly track a team's \"people status\" and embed it\ninto their regular operational cadence. Just as team managers adjust\nproduction processes to improve output or yield, they can now quickly adjust\ntheir management processes to improve team productivity.\n\nJohn Deere, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, [embeds the tracking of\nemployee engagement](https://hbr.org/2016/05/why-john-deere-measures-employee-\nmorale-every-two-weeks) into their bi-weekly scrum. They found that this\nhelped them:\n\n  1. Stay competitive in a rapidly changing business environment;\n  2. Find problems before they escalated out of control;\n  3. Build effective teams.\n\nThe way it works is simple: short questionnaires, anywhere from 1 to 15\nquestions, are sent out at a cadence determined by regular operations. In John\nDeere's case, each operational cycle lasts two weeks, so their surveys are\nsent every two weeks. Results are analyzed and communicated at each\noperational meeting, together with other production or project updates, and\nteam leaders can take immediate action to rectify people problems proactively.\n\nThis methodology is known as pulse surveying, and is not to be confused with a\nshorter, more compressed version of traditional survey cycles. Having a half-\nyearly or quarterly survey, as long as the follow-up actions are discontinuous\nfrom BAU, creates an incremental cognitive load for the company each time the\nsurvey is executed, and is liable to create \"survey fatigue.\"\n\nConversely, pulse surveying acts almost as a \"[Fitbit for\nmanagement](http://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/exclusive/engagerocket-\nfunctions-fitbit-management),\" allowing teams to self-regulate, managers to\ntrack the impact of their leadership style, and HR interventions to be more\nstrategically targeted at segments that consistently find themselves needing\nhelp.\n\nIn my next post, I will cover just how a company can operationalize this\nprocess, the improvements that such a process can generate, and how this can\ntransform leadership development, organizational efficiency, and of course,\nemployee engagement.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/engagerocketco) or\n[LinkedIn](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/cheetung).

For\nmost employees, the annual workplace ritual tends to elicit the same kind of\nreaction that students get when they receive their year-end report card \u2013\neither cold sweat or casual indifference, depending on how much they value\ntheir job.\n\nIt's not a process that supervisors relish either, with some having to deal\nwith dozens under their charge, countless hours of administration, and making\n\u2013 and defending \u2013 difficult decisions. Angst from bosses and subordinates\naside, common complaints that have frequently been pointed out include the\nfact that conventional appraisals are prone to bias, demotivating, and do not\neffectively raise overall performance \u2013 making it a process that is more form\nthan substance. Yet, companies are reluctant to seek alternatives. This week,\nwe evaluate the performance appraisal system to see if it still works and\nwhether a revolution is needed.\n\n**Where we stand**\n\nFor many employees, the yearly performance review is already so deeply\ningrained in their psyche as a fundamental part of work life that they cannot\nquite imagine a time before it.\n\nBut the concept of an appraisal - now ubiquitous in corporate Singapore - did\nnot emerge from a vacuum.\n\n#### Stay updated with  \nBT newsletters\n\n[Terms & conditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)\n\nSign up\n\nEugene Chang, senior principal at Korn Ferry, explains: \"The conventional\nperformance management system is often touted as best practice - this is\nbecause the large American corporations, seen as best in the world, first\nadopted them and made them popular.\"\n\n\"We continue to use them as it has become the norm. This doesn't make it the\nbest.\"\n\nDavid Leong, founder and managing director of HR consulting firm\nPeopleworldwide, notes that the assessments are neither a science nor an art -\nmostly mixed with intuition, bias and preferences.\n\nHe is more sympathetic to what he deems a necessary evil: \"The performance\nsystem for people is never perfect, but some measurements with quantitative\ntools are still better than none.\"\n\n\"Employers and HR had to devise a system to benchmark (workers) and hence KPIs\n(key performance indicators) have become important lamp-posts for measuring\nindividual performance\u2026 at least, such measurements will be more clinical and\ncan be scored quantitatively.\"\n\nIn many workplaces in Singapore, the entire appraisal process has hardly\nchanged since the start of its implementation and follows a very predictable\npattern.\n\nIt usually goes like this: Once (or twice) a year, employees scratch their\nheads trying to fill in a form where they are forced to grade themselves on\ntheir performance.\n\nThe self-evaluation forms then reach their supervisors for them to compare\nwith their own assessment and account for any variances. Following which\nmanagers get together to duke it out and rank the workers - often based on a\nbell-curve - before submitting to HR.\n\nDepending on how much back and forth there is between management and HR, as\nwell as how digitalised the system is, the process could take weeks or months\nbefore getting finalised.\n\nAt the end of it, workers get called into their superior's office to discuss\nany findings from the appraisal.\n\nBut with managers on a deadline to complete the process with their many\nsubordinates, and the supervisor's office the equivalent of a drive-through\nduring the time of the year, such sessions tend to be brief or even generic.\n\n**Broken but still not fixed**\n\nThe conventional performance evaluation system is universally abhorred for\nmany reasons.\n\nFor one, the amount of time and work spent on carrying out a performance\nreview is enough to strike fear into the hearts of the most unflappable\nmanager.\n\nLeong Chee Tung, CEO of HR startup EngageRocket, noted that performance\nassessments take up a \"huge amount of bandwidth\" - on average, managers spend\nup to 210 hours per year on performance management, or about 10 per cent of\ntheir time.\n\n\"The effort that goes into executing the exercise is so massive that running\nit once or even twice a year becomes a huge administrative hassle,\" he\nobserves.\n\nBut for him, the biggest bone he has to pick with traditional evaluation\nmethods is the subjectivity of such reviews. For example, the performance\nacross different business functions cannot currently be perfectly calibrated\nand ranked against one another, he notes.\n\n\"It's difficult to agree whether someone's performance in the Finance\ndepartment this year contributed more or less than someone's performance in\nOperations,\" he explains.\n\nEven within each function, business priorities and the relative importance of\nvarious projects shift throughout the year, making it difficult to quantify\nand rank performance, adds Mr Leong.\n\nAnd because the performance review system is expected to play a role in\ndeciding how to distribute a limited pool of rewards, this poses real problems\nin practice. \"Because of the subjective way performance is captured, leaders\nwho are more persuasive tend to make a better case for their teams under them,\nresulting in biases based on a managerial trait that may have little to do\nwith actual business impact,\" he says.\n\nAccording to Korn Ferry's Mr Chang, the heart of the problems surrounding the\ntraditional appraisal system is much more fundamental.\n\n\"The conventional performance management system was meant for an\nindustrialised world,\" he explained. \"Today's world has shifted from command\nand control to innovation and agility.\"\n\nThis means that tracking performance has become a lot more complex. In the\npast, workers could be evaluated based on production and delivery in terms of\nsheer numbers, but now it is a lot more ambiguous.\n\nAs such, he describes the system as inflexible and failing to fit the faster,\nmore agile needs of businesses today. This could also have a serious impact on\ntalent attraction and retention, he warns.\n\nThe lack of frequency and growth can be demotivating to employees, especially\nwith the millennial workforce, he adds.\n\nIt is a stark mismatch in expectations: Younger employees have grown up in a\ndigital environment where feedback is immediate. But once they enter the\nworkplace, they fast realise that feedback can be like squeezing water out of\na rock.\n\nFeedback that comes once a year conducted by harried bosses who conduct\nappraisal meetings just to satisfy HR policy, and not from a desire to mentor,\nis of little use to anyone.\n\nMany managers are also not equipped to mentor or to carry out performance\nreviews, rendering the process even more irrelevant.\n\nEngageRocket's Mr Leong points out: \"Besides allocating scarce rewards, an\nimportant component of tracking and reporting performance is to support\nmentoring and coaching conversations to improve each individual's respective\nskills over time.\"\n\n\"Without a system to support managers in executing this, companies leave\npeople management to random variation in their managers' skills.\"\n\n**The dreaded bell curve**\n\nThe component of performance management systems that has faced the harshest\ncriticism is the dreaded bell curve. Mr Chang describes it as an \"evil\"\nconstruct that mainly drives pay distribution concerns and not performance.\n\nGrading on a bell curve forces workers into a normal distribution model where\nthere are a small number of higher performers and an equal number of low\nperformers. Most people will fall into the average range.\n\nIn reality, the performance distribution of the team is unlikely to fall into\nsuch neat categories.\n\nEngageRocket's Mr Leong describes it as an \"imperfect solution\" and a means to\nan end, namely resource allocation.\n\n\"Bell curves reward relative performance instead of objective performance\u2026\nreal performance may not follow a bell curve,\" he explains.\n\nFor example, if a team has five people and all five are equally excellent, the\nbell curve will force one to get the lion's share of rewards, while the one at\nthe \"bottom\" could be left with nothing.\n\nHe adds that such a practice removes transparency and can be used to cover up\npoor management practices, such as supervisors being unwilling to have\ndifficult conversations with underperformers.\n\nIt is also not quite possible to use the same bell curve across different\ndepartments.\n\nThe implication of the bell curve is that it does not seek to promote\nperformance improvement as most people can just hide in the middle instead of\nstriving to fulfil their potential. There is little impetus to grow and do\nbetter.\n\nWhile bell curves can identify relatively non-performing staff,\nPeopleworldwide's Mr Leong cautions that it could be a blunt instrument if not\nused with \"care and sensitivity\".\n\nHe explains that eliminating workers based on a bell curve will have a\n\"psychological impact\" on self worth. \"Tools should be used to measure and to\nimprove (workers) and not as sole elimination tools where people are not\ngroomed but eliminated,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to be careful how tools are used to measure and appraise people.\"\n\n**Case studies: Deloitte and Adobe**\n\nThe good thing is, more leaders are now recognising the need to get the\nprocess right and becoming an \"increasing business priority\", says Mr Chang.\n\nTwo forward-looking companies that are paving the way are Adobe and Deloitte.\n\nAccording to Seah Gek Choo, talent partner, Deloitte Singapore, the firm\nrealised more than five years ago that its system was increasingly \"out of\nstep\" in today's evolving business and talent landscape.\n\n\"It was more about rewarding performance already exhibited, but not focused on\nimproving performance,\" she explains.\n\nWith millennials and Gen Z making up over 80 per cent of its workforce, such\nan antiquated system can no longer bear up to scrutiny.\n\n\"They need more frequent development-focused feedback and leveraging of\nstrengths instead of a once-a-year performance assessment involving lengthy\ndocumentation that tell our people they are average by force-fitting them in\nbell curves,\" she said.\n\nDeloitte designed its own performance management system that is in real-time,\nnimbler, and more individualised - something squarely focused on fuelling\nperformance in the future rather than assessing it in the past.\n\nStarted in other Deloitte offices around the world since 2015, the new system\nwas adopted by the Singapore office in September this year.\n\nAt the core of its reinvented system is more regular check-ins between members\nand their team leaders about work priorities, performance, and alignment to\nstrengths.\n\n\"We believe that if you want people to talk about how to do their best work in\nthe near future, they need to talk often,\" says Ms Seah.\n\nAnother component of Deloitte's system is performance snapshots, otherwise\nknown as simple assessments of a team member's performance at a given point in\ntime, based on the day-to-day experience of working with them.\n\nCarried out every quarter at the minimum or after a major project is\ncompleted, this enables the organisation to gather a team leader's first-hand\nassessment of the member's performance.\n\nIt entails four future-focused questions about each team member that\nconcentrates on what the leaders would do with each member, rather than what\nthey think of the individual, explains Ms Seah.\n\nThese data points are aggregated over the year, and produce a \"rich stream of\ninformation\" for leaders' discussions of what they will do in terms of\nsuccession planning, development paths or performance pattern analysis.\n\nShe cites statistics that in countries that were early adopters of the new\nperformance management system, 75 per cent agree that check-ins are a valuable\nuse of their time. Some 66 per cent of leaders say that the data enables them\nto develop their people and 60 per cent agreed that they can make better\ndecisions at the end of the year.\n\nDeloitte's transformation process is somewhat similar to Adobe, which started\nto revamp its process way back in 2012.\n\nSarah Dunn, head of Employee Experience, Asia Pacific, Adobe, says: \"We\nrealised that we were not really helping people improve their performances, or\nencouraging faster innovation, or meeting their career objectives.\"\n\nAdobe made the bold move to abolish the usual bell curve appraisal through\nmore lightweight and productive \"check-ins\". The abolition of rankings also\nmeant that employees are compensated against how well they accomplished their\ndevelopmental goals.\n\nThe new check-in system does not delink performance from rewards, but\nencourages a more holistic approach for rewarding individual contributions to\nthe team, she explains.\n\nEven as managers are more empowered to make such decisions, they are not left\nto their own devices.\n\nMs Dunn explains: \"We have also invested in training the managers and guiding\nthem to focus on goals, objectives, career development and strategies for each\nindividual's improvement, instead of dwelling on the individual's\nshortcomings.\"\n\nManagers' skill sets also had to be built around compensation planning for the\nannual rewards check-in process so that they can differentiate pay based on\nemployee performance and market conditions, she adds. And while the idea of\nfrequent check-ins seems like a hassle, data has found the opposite to hold\ntrue instead.\n\n\"With check-in, we are saving more time now as there are no stringent steps,\nno prescribed timings and no forms to fill out for submission to the HR team,\"\nshe explains.\n\n\"This also means no more late nights for managers scrambling to write detailed\nreviews for the record, and no more competitive motives underlying teammate\ninteractions (due to the bell curve).\"\n\nSince its rollout, the introduction has helped Adobe Asia Pacific reduce the\namount of time spent on the process by up to 5,000 hours annually. They have\nalso seen a drop in voluntary attrition, at a time when they cannot afford to\nlose talent, she adds.\n\n**The future of work?**\n\nWhile the two companies seemed to make it look easy, both acknowledged that\nchanging a legacy system was no walk in the park.\n\nMs Dunn says the biggest challenge Adobe had to overcome was in the mind:\n\"Some employees were initially uncomfortable with the idea of a performance\nmanagement process that had so little structure and documentation.\"\n\nTo overcome this, she says the firm \"invested heavily\" in change management to\nhelp managers take ownership of the process and establish a culture in which\nemployees would welcome and act upon ongoing feedback.\n\nDeloitte's Ms Seah points out that for many firms out there, they fall prey to\nthe idea that if it isn't broken, don't fix it.\n\n\"By and large, the legacy performance review systems have been in place and\nhave worked for so long. People generally like the predictability of the\nprocess and that there is an eventual rating that a person can easily\nbenchmark to an expected compensation,\" she says.\n\nBut the reality is that the workforce is evolving, and that organisations need\nto consider redesigning them now rather than later.\n\nThis is in order to \"bring out the best in their people\" which will translate\nto success for the business in the new world of work, said Ms Seah.\n\nBut before firms leap blindly into a performance management system revamp,\nKorn Ferry's Mr Chang's advice for employers is to figure out what they are\ntrying to achieve.\n\nHe asks: \"Is it just for differentiating performance between employees or does\nit have a part in raising individual performance, employee engaging, culture\nshaping and so on?\"\n\nNext, listen to employees and managers who are using and being subjected to\nthese systems if a redesign is in the works - often a forgotten step in the\nprocess, notes Mr Chang.\n\nFinally, he suggests introducing technology to augment the value that managers\nbring and support them well through training. \"There are no simple formulas as\neven the best companies are trying to figure out the best way forward,\" he\nnotes.\n\nBut one thing is for sure - it will become a part of the unique competitive\nadvantage of companies as they find more ways to increase performance and to\nwin the talent war.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  *

and Collision8 merge in major co-working consolidation\n\nMore\n\n# Called Found8, the company will soon be opening its first space outside of\nSinagpore\n\nTwo of Singapore\u2019s most prominent co-working spaces, Found and Collision8,\n[announced today](https://mailchi.mp/a850232a333d/community-\nnewsletter-31-january-1773225?fbclid=IwAR2h3T6DjQsDDWMbevONovvoHhS_0b00us9JUDViGH7nsmhfSyrNahIVWPc)\na merger that will rebrand the company into Found8.\n\nThe merger will combine the two company\u2019s investment warchest and give Found8\nUS$20 million of financing.\n\nThe first major event post-merger will be the impending opening of a new\n22,000 square feet space in Kuala Lumpur. The Kuala Lumpur project is part of\na drive to build a large startup ecosystem in the heart of Sentral Station, a\nstrategy that is being borrowed from Station F in Paris.\n\nFound8 will pursue further regional expansion.\n\nIts five Singapore locations are at Amoy, Anson, Cuppage, High Street Centre\nand Prinsep.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy has always been that collaboration is better than competition.\nAs we regionalise, Found8 is set to create meaningful innovation ecosystems\neverywhere we go. We are creating a new benchmark for the future of co-working\nin Asia,\u201d said Grace Sai the Co-CEO of Found8.\n\n **Also Read:[Our idea of a good Valentine: Free Echelon Asia Summit 2019\ntickets](https://e27.co/echelon-2019-valentine-promo-20190210/)**\n\nThe space now has around 1,000 members, including notable startup-focussed\ncompanies like Antler, General Assembly and Slush.\n\nFound8 is also Google for Startup\u2019s first Southeast Asia partner, which means\nco-working members will get access to a suite of perks, philosophies and\ncommunities.\n\nThe pre-merger space Found was started by Sai and was originally known as\nImpactHub. Sai\u2019s space is famous for [launching an investment\nfund](https://e27.co/singapores-impact-hub-is-now-a-co-working-space-with-an-\ninvestment-fund-20170110/) to potentially fund companies working within the\nspace. Portfolio companies include anywhr, Nimbus and EngageRocket.\n\nCollision8 was Founded by Michelle Yong, who also leads the corporate venture\nfund for Arum Investments. Notably, Arum invested in the co-living space\nHmlet.\n\nThe duo will now be co-CEOs with Sai expected to focus on corporate innovation\nwhile Yong will drive regional expansion and customer service.\n\n\u201cFound8 is bringing transformation and growth not only to startups but also\ntraditional family businesses and corporates. Our community is collaborative\nand dedicated to driving business growth, collectively. The best part of this\nmerger is that my biggest competitor is now my partner,\u201d said Yong.\n\n **Also Read:[AI-based digital music discovery platform Musiio secures US$1M\nseed

and Arum Investments).\n\n **e27** reached out with questions about the the strategic relationship with\nWeWork and will update accordingly.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe post [Found and Collision8 merge in major

min read\n\nOpinions expressed by _Entrepreneur_ contributors are their own.\n\n\n\nFrederick Taylor's ideas of \"scientific management\" caught the business\nworld's attention in the early 20th century, at a time when industrialization\nand large-scale production technologies were being adopted.\n\nHis insight that \"the principal object of management should be to secure the\nmaximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity of\neach employee\" planted the seed of \"people management\", which Peter Drucker\nand others built on in later decades.\n\nAs we start 2019, here are three trends that will dominate our thinking on how\nwe manage people better this year.\n\n **Personalized employee experiences**\n\nWe spend large amounts of time, effort and money trying to understand\ncustomers and personalize their experiences -- who they are, what they respond\nbest to, how to keep them happy and even how to get them to recommend your\nbrand to others.\n\nIf employees are dedicating more than 40 hours per week to help your company\nachieve its goals, wouldn't it make sense to use similar techniques to\nunderstand and motivate them at the personal level too?\n\nIn 2019, the movement to create personalized employee experiences is gathering\nsignificant momentum. Chip and Dan Heath, professors at the Stanford School of\nBusiness, point out the missed opportunity for engagement that is an\nemployee's first day at work. Beyond the first few weeks of \"onboarding\",\nemployees go through other stages like receiving their first performance\nappraisal, taking on new assignments or projects, getting a raise or\npromotion, learning on the job and even eventually separation.\n\nThe common interface for all these experiences would likely be their immediate\nmanager. Equipping managers to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to\nmanagement to a one-size-fits-one approach would improve the quality of these\n\"moments of truth\" and improve employee loyalty and productivity.\n\n **Data-driven approach**\n\nStudies have found that organizations who are more advanced at using data to\nanalyze the workforce proactively, make predictions, create and monitor\ncomprehensive workforce plans make 56 per cent higher profit margins than less\nadvanced organizations.\n\nTraditionally, people management has been more art than science. Leaders, if\nthey are fortunate, undergo management training to get them up to speed on\nbest practices. In most aspects of leadership though, the question of how to\nmotivate and retain their people has relied heavily on personal experience and\njudgement.\n\nEspecially in Asia, where employees tend to be less forthcoming with their\nopinions about their bosses and management, may have no way of telling if\ntheir recent town hall adequately communicated their vision, or if the\nperformance feedback they gave was well received, or whether their team is\nclear about what needs to be done to achieve their objectives.\n\nTwo major enablers have come on to the scene to allow leaders to be more data-\ndriven.\n\nFirst, the speed of data collection and analysis has increased significantly,\nallowing for more timely information to be delivered to leaders. For example,\npreviously bosses had to wait for a year or two before results of an employee\nengagement survey were delivered to them. This made it unclear which of their\nactions were actually helpful and prevented them from taking immediate action\non time-sensitive feedback. Unfortunately, this is still common practice in\nmany organisations. Pulse surveys, shorter, ongoing surveys that measure\nemployee sentiment and culture in real-time, allow bosses to instantly\nunderstand their teams and act to keep them motivated and aligned.\n\nSecond, business intelligence technologies have evolved to the point where\nhaving a unified view across different data silos is possible. It has become\neasier than ever before to track the experience of each employee across the\ndifferent stages of their journey with the company and deliver insights about\nhow to engage them better directly to their managers.\n\n **Focus on upskilling and development**\n\nDrone operators, data scientist, social media managers, these are just some\nexamples of jobs in great demand today that didn't exist 10 years ago. Those\ndecades of experience on your resume may count a lot less when dealing with\nnew areas of work that your team members are now responsible for.\n\nAs important as it is for your team to be competent in their current skills,\nencouraging them to nurture the ability to learn new ones has become an\neconomic imperative. The average lifespan of an S&P 500 company is now less\nthan 20 years, down from almost 60 in the 1950s. This suggests that companies\nneed to keep innovating just to survive, requiring new skills and expertise.\n\nThese also apply to soft skills. As technology advances, the ability to work\nin teams, balance demands from multiple stakeholders, communicate effectively,\nthink creatively, and others, have become more critical, not less.\n\nPart of the responsibility of people management comes being responsible for\nthe growth and development of the people you manage. Encouraging them to\ndevelop new relevant skills also has the important benefit of improving\nengagement and retention: 87 per cent of millennial workers (born after 1982)\nreport that development is \"important\" in their job.\n\n\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

relocate for the role.\n\nAbout 72% of Singaporeans want to work in a role that allows them to travel\ninternationally, according to a survey by Randstad.\n\nClose to eight in 10 respondents (78%) aged between 18 and 34 are even willing\nto relocate to pursue a meaningful career. As a result, Randstad observed that\nthere is an increasing number of global and regional-level roles based in\nSingapore, particularly in the areas of business development, sales and\nmarketing, accounting and finance, and even software development.\n\n**Also read:** [Overseas returnees hit with job\nmismatches](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/in-focus/overseas-returnees-hit-\njob-mismatches)\n\nIn addition, 79% stated that they would relocate if they can have both a\nmeaningful career and a good work-life balance. Three in four (74%) would move\nfor a higher salary, whilst 66% said that they will also do so if it means\nthat they can keep their jobs with their current employers.\n\nThe top three choices for locally-based respondents to relocate to are\nAustralia, Japan and the US, respectively. However, Randstad's data also\nshowed that six in 10 respondents (58%) would rather switch career than move\nto another country.\n\n\"A majority of the locals would choose to stay in Singapore to remain close to\ntheir friends and family because of its relatively stable and safe\nenvironment,\" managing director at Randstad Singapore and Malaysia Jaya Dass\nsaid.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

startups have an average monthly recurring revenue of over US$29,632 each**_\n  * _**Over 40% of the Accelerating Asia portfolio now includes startups with female co-founders**_\n\n\n\n![The ten startups in  Accelerating Asia Cohort\n2](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Accelerating%20Asia%20Cohort%202%20-%202.JPG)\n\nACCELERATING Asia, a startup accelerator and early stage venture capital fund\nheadquartered in Singapore, has formally unveiled its second cohort.\n\nThe ten startups that comprise Accelerating Asia's second cohort hail from six\ncountries namely, Australia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and\nSingapore. They have already raised over US$1.48 million (S$2 million) in\nfunding ahead of the programme, employ close to 200 people and have an average\nmonthly recurring revenue of over (US$29,632) S$40,000.\n\nAs a partner of Enterprise Singapore's Startup SG Accelerator programme,\ncontributes to the growth of startups and the vibrancy of the innovation\necosystem in Singapore.  Each startup will receive an additional US$74,081\n(S$100,000) in growth funding from Accelerating Asia's venture arm, taking the\nsecond cohort's combined funding to over US$2.22 million (S$3 million).\n\nAccelerating Asia co-founder Craig Bristol Dixon said, \"We are delighted to\nunveil the latest cohort of startups - companies who are already disrupting\ntraditional industries such as agriculture, logistics and finance. This truly\nreflects the depth and maturity of entrepreneurs and the Southeast Asia\necosystem.\"\n\nIn a first for Accelerating Asia, startups from Myanmar and Australia have\njoined its programme. The inclusion of these startups diversifies Accelerating\nAsia's investments into new markets, expanding its combined reach to nine\ncountries. Accelerating Asia also saw an increase in startup maturity based on\nthe number of startups already generating revenue.\n\nThe new cohort also features female-led ventures - Romoni, Recyglo, Priyoshop\nand Joni.ai, with 40% of the Accelerating Asia portfolio now including\nstartups with female co-founders.\n\n\"All the ventures coming into cohort two are catalysts for positive change,\nfor example, Joni.ai is transforming education, delivering AI-powered\nplatforms that are customising learning according to student needs,\"\nAccelerating Asia co-founder Amra Naidoo said.\n\nThe number of startup investment deals done in Southeast Asia has almost\ndoubled in the past year, according to a recent 2019 report by Cento Ventures.\n\nEarly-stage investments below US$500,000 (RM2.05 million) spiked in the first\nhalf of 2019 due in part to deals done by accelerators and incubators such as\nAccelerating Asia. The announcement of the second cohort brings the number of\nAccelerating Asia's deals to 20 in the last six months, worth a total of S$2\nmillion.\n\n\"During recruitment, we had touchpoints with over 2,000 startups and selected\nten from over 200 eligible applications,\" Amra said.\n\n\"Our recruitment and selection process allows us first-look access to emerging\ntechnologies and direct deal flow across the portfolio. Our last cohort had\nsignificant growth during the four months with Accelerating Asia - these\nstartups raised over US$3 million, achieved 2.5x MRR growth and created 40 new\njobs,\" added Amra.\n\nLim Seow Hui, director of Startup Development at Enterprise Singapore, said,\n\"Enterprise Singapore looks forward to a continued relationship with\nAccelerating Asia, an important partner in our network of Startup SG partners.\nAccelerating Asia will play a crucial role in supporting a diverse group of\ninnovative entrepreneurs.\n\n\"These startups are well-placed to leverage the connections and knowledge of\nour Startup SG partners to identify and capture new opportunities brought\nabout by the rapid economic growth in the region, as well as the increasing\nemphasis on sustainable development globally,\" she said.\n\nAccelerating Asia's 2nd cohort of startups are:\n\n  1. **[Hellotask](https://hellotask.app/)** is an app based platform that upskills domestic workers and connects them to employment opportunities as on-demand, verified maid services to households.\n  2. **[iFarmer](https://ifarmer.asia/)** delivers innovative financing for agriculture and farming by enabling secure investing for individuals and institutions and ensures a return on investment by providing market access and support services for partner farmers.\n  3. **[IZY.ai](https://www.izy.ai/)** uses the latest mobile and machine learning technology to deliver concierge services that customises guest experience to elevate hotel stays, digitises hotel services and improves internal hotel productivity.\n  4. **[Joni.ai](https://www.joni.ai/)** is an AI-powered adaptive assessment platform that personalises education and helps students to make sense of their learning data.\n  5. **[Moovby](https://www.moovby.com/)** is a car rental marketplace or the Airbnb for Cars, where travellers can rent any car they want, whenever they want it, from a vibrant community of local owners.\n  6. **[Nitex](https://nitex.info/index.php)** connects businesses to streamlined overseas production and standardised apparel sourcing for remote buyers by providing transparency and process optimisation.\n  7. **[NumuWorld](https://www.numuworld.com/)** is an app that enables brands to reward customers who promote their business on social media.

2020\n\n  * _**Expanded POS offering with e-commerce and QR loyalty cashback program**_\n  * _**Powers 13,000 stores in the region with transaction value of over US$1.2bil**_\n\n![Founders, Li Congyu \\(left\\), who is the CTO and Fong Wai Hong who is CEO,\nlaunched StoreHub in 2013 in\nMalaysia.](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Li%20Congyu%20\\(left\\)%20and%20Fong%20Wai%20Hong%2C%20StoreHub%20founders.png)\n\nStoreHub has raised a US$8.9 million (RM36.2 million) funding round led by\nreturning investors Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia & India, with participation\nfrom Accord Ventures and a private family office with dual headquarters in\nSoutheast Asia and Europe.\n\nThe round brings StoreHub's total funding to US$15 million (RM61 million). The\nnew funding round will bolster its aggressive growth and expansion in line\nwith Southeast Asia's booming economy.\n\nStoreHub has seen rapid growth since its Series A raise in 2018, from 3,000 to\nover 13,000 stores in Southeast Asia, with transaction growth from US$269\nmillion to US$1.2 billion to date. Headquartered in Singapore, the Malaysian\nfounded company has a regional team of 325 people located across multiple\noffices in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Manila and Shanghai.\n\n\"Investors like our strong unit economics and recurring revenue model which\nare key to our sustainable growth and ability to reach profitability very\nquickly when we want to,\" said CEO and Cofounder, Fong Wai Hong.\n\nCofounded in 2013 by Fong and Li Congyu, StoreHub has developed from a simple\ntablet-based POS provider to an omnichannel operating system for SMEs with\nofferings that include an e-commerce platform, a QR code-powered loyalty\ncashback program and, for F&B outlets, a table ordering system.\n\nCofounder Li, who leads the 50+ Product & Engineering team from Shanghai\nChina, says her ultimate goal is to bring technology closer to everyone and\nhelp entrepreneurs embrace and leverage technology to grow their business to\nreach Southeast Asia's population of 360million connected users.\n\nWith the retail scene in Southeast Asia experiencing a big shift driven\nprimarily by technology, Fong notes that \"what we're seeing is that businesses\nwhich are thriving are those embracing technology to automate the management\nand growth of their stores, while those that don't are struggling to cope with\nthe drastic changes in consumer behaviour.\"\n\nFong is referring to how smartphone empowered consumers are becoming more\ninformed and have higher expectations of delivery times and service standards.\n\nChua Joo Hock, Managing Partner at Vertex Ventures SEA & India believes Fong\nand his team are poised to be a major player in the retail revolution.\n\n\"Capitalising on its strength in tech and understanding what businesses need,\nStoreHub leads the industry in rolling out new innovations to enable\nbusinesses to increase their revenue and productivity. Their rapidly growing\nuser base and high retention rate are strong indicators of the value in\nStoreHub's platform. We're excited to work with StoreHub to help businesses\nlevel up and stay relevant in this digital economy age.\"\n\n![Some of StoreHub's customers

unemployment rate rose marginally to 2.3% in Q3 2019, up from 2.2%\nin Q2 2019. The uptick in unemployment is seen amongst residents (to 3.2% from\n3.1%) and citizens (to 3.3% from 3.2%).\n\nHowever, Singapore's employment growth surged by 22,400 in 3Q 2019,\nsignificantly higher than 2Q 2019's gain of 6,200 and a year ago of 16,700.\n\n**Also read:**  [Unemployment rate hits 3.3% in Q2](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/unemployment-rate-hits-33-in-q2)\n\nAccording to UOB, the labour market remains relatively resilient because\nemployment in all three key industries--services, construction, and\nmanufacturing--grew during the quarter. Employment in the services cluster\nrose tp 16,100 persons in Q3 from Q3 2018's 13,800 employed people.\n\nThe construction sector added 5,300 newly-employed people as a result of\nrobust private and public sector construction activities. The manufacturing\nsector also saw its headcount rise by 1,200, bucking the fall seen in the last\nthree consecutive quarters.\n\nFurthermore, UOB noted that unemployment remained historically low in Q3.\nSingapore's jobless rate previously peaked at 3.3% in Q3 2009.\n\nGovernment initiatives also helps in upholding the health of Singapore's\nlabour market. Support schemes include the 'Adapt and Grow' initiative, the\nCareer Support Programme (CSP) and the Professional Conversion Programmes\n(PCPs). \"These schemes may have reduced structural unemployment as employees\ncan seek assistance in adapting to changing job demands and reskill for new\ncareers, whilst employers may seek salary support in hiring long-term\nunemployed Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET)\njobseekers,\" said UOB.\n\nThe A&G initiative enabled about 22,000 jobseekers to find work between\nJanuary and August, of which 12,000 were aged 40 and above, according to data\nfrom the Ministry of Manpower.\n\nHowever, UOB noted that there is a cautious hiring sentiment in the island,\nunemployment. Back in our labour report in September, with hiring managers\npreferring to place workers on  \nshorter workweek or temporary layoff arrangements rather than opting to\nretrench  \nworkers.\n\nThis was reflected in the government's inflation report for September, where\nthe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and\nIndustry stated that labour market conditions \"are softening slightly...\n(which) would lower wage growth in 2019 and 2020\".  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?

\n\n![](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/600x360/news/eca-\nsalary.png)\n\n# Singaporeans' pay hike may moderate to 3% in 2020: study\n\nLow inflation, tight labour supply and talent restrictions could keep salary\nhigh.\n\nThe average real salary increase for Singaporean workers is expected to\ncontract to 3% in 2020 from 3.3% in 2019, according to a study by research\nfirm ECA International. This is based on a 4% expected nominal increase and a\npredicted inflation of 1%.\n\nDespite this, Lee Quane, ECA International's regional director for Asia, said\nthat Singaporeans can still expect a larger salary hike than that of its\nregional neighbours such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.\n\n\"The notably low level of inflation that Singapore has seen over the recent\nyears, coupled with a tight labour supply and talent restrictions due to\nimmigration constraints, implies that salary increases will remain relatively\nhigh,\" Quane said.\n\nOut of the top 20 countries with the highest projected real salary increases\nfor 2020, 13 came from Asia. The top five spots in the global rankings are\nnabbed by India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand.\n\nQuane said that the average real salary growth in the Asia Pacific for the\nyear is projected at 3.2%, higher than the 1.4% global average and almost\nthree times the 1.1% European average, attributed to low inflation and rising\nproductivity.\n\nVietnam and Thailand are expected to see a real salary growth of 5.1% and\n4.1%, respectively. China's salaries are also expected to see a 3.6% growth.\n\nHowever, workers in Malaysia are expected to see a big drop in their real\nsalary increases for the year to 2.9%, from 4.0% in 2019. Quane said that\ninflation in the country is expected to rise from 1.0% to 2.1%.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

_**Funds will go into enhancing its open platform for third-party developers**_\n  * _**The company 's total funding now stands at US$294 million**_\n\n\n\n![The entire AppsFlyer\nteam](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/AppsFlyer%20Whole%20Team%20Photo.JPG)\n\nAPPSFLYER, the global attribution leader, on Jan 21 announced a US$210 million\n(RM852 million) Series D funding round led by General Atlantic, a global\ngrowth equity firm based in New York. Alex Crisses, managing director at\nGeneral Atlantic, and Anton Levy, co-president and global head of Technology,\nhave joined AppsFlyer's board of directors.\n\nThis investment comes three years after AppsFlyer's Series C funding round,\nbringing the company's total funding to US$294 million (RM1.2 billion). Since\nthe previous round, AppsFlyer has grown its team 4X to 850 employees\nthroughout 18 global offices. This year it opened its seventh Asia-Pacific\noffice, in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nAppsFlyer, one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses, has seen 5X growth in\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR), exceeding US$150 million (RM609 million) in\n2019. This follows a five-year growth in ARR from US$1 million (RM4.1 million)\nto US$100 million (RM406 million).\n\n\"We are excited to partner with a company that has an experienced team and a\nculture focused on the customer,\" said Crisses.\n\n\"Attribution is becoming the core of the marketing tech stack, and AppsFlyer\nhas established itself as a leader in this fast-growing category. AppsFlyer's\ncommitment to being independent, unbiased, and representing the marketer's\ninterests has garnered the trust of many of the world's leading brands, and we\nsee significant potential to capture additional opportunity in the market.\"\n\nFrom Indonesia's Ruangguru to India's Rubicon Research, General Atlantic has\nbeen expanding its Asia portfolio in recent years.\n\n\"At General Atlantic, we partner with transformative companies that drive\nsuccess, innovation, and value, and we view AppsFlyer as a disruptor in its\nmarket,\" said Levy.\n\n\"AppsFlyer's scale enables it to provide accurate attribution data and ad-\nfraud protection, saving millions for advertisers. At the same time, the\ncompany has the end-user in mind every step of the way. As data privacy\nbecomes one of the primary concerns facing brands, we are energized to partner\nwith a technology leader that has a mindset of privacy by design and security\nfirst.\"\n\n\"As a market leader, we are proud and humbled to know that AppsFlyer's\nplatform is used daily by many marketing teams around the world,\" said\nAppsFlyer chief executive officer and co-founder Oren Kaniel.\n\n\"We take this responsibility very seriously. This new round enables us to\ndouble down on our mission to empower marketers with the tools needed to\ncatapult their success and make accurate, better-informed, strategic\ndecisions, as well as help drive innovation and transparency across our\nindustry.\"\n\nSpeaking about how this development will impact the region, AppsFlyer APAC\npresident and managing director Ronen Mense, said: \"This 2020 we predict that\nAPAC will hold the world's largest quantity of app-install ad spend at US$30\nbillion (RM122 billion). With massive volume and scale in this truly mobile-\nfirst region, marketers will be looking even harder into how they can better\noptimise their marketing budgets.\n\n\"There is also the imminent danger of fraud exposure for brands and users\nalike, where sadly, APAC leads in the world's fastest fraud rate-growth at 60%\nhigher than the global average. This funding will go into strengthening our\nopen platform for partners and third-party developers, allowing them the\nflexibility to add their custom solutions on top of ours, so they can more\nconfidently grow and protect their businesses in a highly competitive\nmarketplace like APAC.\"\n\nAppsFlyer works with more than 12,000 customers, including leading brands such\nas Gojek, Agoda, Tokopedia, SEA Group (Shopee & Garena), HBO, Tencent, and\nNike, and is connected to an ecosystem of over 5,000 partners, including\nFacebook, Google, Apple Search Ads, Twitter, Salesforce, Adobe, and Oracle.\n\nExisting investors Qumra Capital, Goldman Sachs Growth, (DTCP) Deutsche\nTelekom Capital Partners, Pitango Venture Capital, and Magma Venture Partners\nparticipated in the round as well.\n\n\n\n###### Related Stories :\n\n  * [AppsFlyer enhances mobile marketing in Indonesia](/business/appsflyer-enhances-mobile-marketing-indonesia)\n  * [AppsFlyer launches SEA mobile

improvements in workers' life expectancy.\n\nThe Tripartite Workgroup called to raise the retirement age to 65 and the re-\nemployment age to 70 by the end of the next decade and demanded that the first\nincreases to take place by 1 July 2022, a document has revealed. This is after\nprime minister Lee Hsien Loong has approved the reforms in his National Day\nRally speech.\n\nThis is to take into account the workers' improvements in life expectancy, the\nbetter-educated and higher-skilled workers, and enhanced organisational\ncapacity to manage older workers well, TWG said.\n\nAdditionally, TWG said that those aged 55 to 60 should reach the total CPF\ncontribution rate of 37%; those aged 60 to 70 should have smaller but\nmeaningful [increases in CPF contribution rates](https://sbr.com.sg/co-\nwritten-partner/more-news/mom-led-group-review-seniors-cpf-rates) and that\nthose aged above 70 should see no change to their current CPF contribution\nrates.\n\nThe current full CPF contribution rate is 37% for workers aged 55 and below.\n\n\"Raising their CPF contributions could affect their employability with not\nmuch boost to their retirement savings, as employers have no obligation to re-\nemploy workers beyond 70,\" the Workgroup said. \"As a start, employers and\nworkers should each increase their CPF contribution rate by either 0.5%-point\nor 1%-point in 2021.\"\n\nDo you know more about this story?

second-to-last globally in terms of inclusion and diversity.\n\nSingapore may be the [world's most competitive\neconomy](https://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-dethrones-us-most-\ncompetitive-economy) but it's workplace environment has some shaping up to do\nas it finished second-to-last globally when it comes to inclusion and\ndiversity, with employees recording one of the highest levels of bullying and\ndiscomfort, revealed the latest survey by data insights and consulting firm\nKantar.\n\nSingaporean employees report one of the highest levels of bullying (24%) in\ncomparison to other countries surveyed, according to Kantar's Inclusion Index,\nwhich benchmarks employee experiences across the world based on a number of\ncriteria such as gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age,\n\nThe island state also topped the list of countries where people are most\nlikely to be made to 'feel uncomfortable' (32%) by their employers, higher\nthan the overall sectors' average of 25%.\n\n**Also read** : [Over half of Singapore's workforce unsatisfied with their\ncurrent job: report](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/heres-why-singapore-\nworlds-second-most-overworked-city)\n\nThe results of the study showed that many Singaporeans are struggling to deal\nwith pressure, with 44% reporting that they are affected by 'stress and\nanxiety' at work, higher than the global average of 39%. Almost half (49%) of\nthe working population feel that their company should support them more when\nthey are dealing with the health concerns, said Kantar.\n\nThe Index surveyed 18,000 people in 14 countries and working in 24 different\nindustries to produce a new global standard in marking progress towards\nachieving equality and inclusive ways of working. The Inclusion Index creates\na benchmark to help companies move the 'inclusion and diversity' conversation\nfrom 'counting heads' to 'making each head count'.\n\nGeographically, Canada tops the Inclusion Index. The North American country\nboasted good gender representation at senior levels (over 40% female), and 65%\nof Canadians surveyed believe that their companies are actively trying to be\nmore inclusive and diverse and supporting all employees regardless of who they\nare.\n\nUSA followed with its strong equal representation in terms of gender at senior\nleadership, and 30% representation at senior leadership in terms of ethnicity.\n63% of Americans believe that their companies are actively trying to be more\ninclusive and diverse and 67% stated that their companies support all\nemployees regardless of who they are. In both countries bullying was also\nprevalent, with about 20% of Canadians and 17% of Americans experiencing\nbullying in the past year.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

manufacturing sectors.\n\nSingapore's unemployment rate inched up to 3.3% in Q2 from 3.2% previously as\nemployment growth slowed, according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).\n\n**Also read** : [Job vacancies decline after seven straight quarters of growth\nin Q1](https://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/job-vacancies-decline-after-seven-\nstraight-quarters-growth-in-q1)\n\nThe report noted that although total employment grew by 4,000 in Q2, the\nheadline figure is lower than last quarter's 10,700 and 6,500 from June 2018.\n\nMOM noted that the slowing employment might mean that whilst most employers\nwere not laying off existing workers, they are exercising greater caution in\nhiring even amidst unfilled vacancies.\n\nEmployment growth remained robust in [Information and\nCommunications](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/pmet-digital-job-\nopenings-nearly-double-in-2018-financials-intensify-tech-hiring), Professional\nServices, Community, Social and Personal Services and Financial Services,\nalthough the increases were offset by the employment decline in Retail Trade.\nAs a result, employment growth in the Services sector slowed. Meanwhile,\nemployment in Construction rose whilst [employment in\nManufacturing](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/chart-\nday-q2-manufacturing-employment-falls-fifteenth-straight-quarter) continued to\ncontract for the third consecutive quarter, with output declining.\n\nThe number of retrenchments in Q2 declined to 2,300 from 3,230 from the\nprevious quarter and 3,030 from Q2 2018 amidst declines in the manufacturing,\nconstruction and services sectors.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

16, 2019  2 min read\n\nIf ever there was a list of most-asked questions for entrepreneurs and\nbusiness leaders, this query would certainly be somewhere in the top five. Why\nnot? After all, our childhood heroes represent who we want to be in life and\ninadvertently shape our ambitions and approach to life. We asked entrepreneurs\nacross the Asia-Pacific region about their childhood heroes and what they\nlearned from them. Here's what they had to say.\n\n( _With inputs from Pooja Singh._ )\n\n## PETER YOONG, co-founder, Pulsifi, Malaysia\n\n![PETER YOONG, co-founder, Pulsifi,\nMalaysia](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/20190216100205-PeteYoongPortraitJacket.jpeg?width=1000)\n\nImage credit: Entrepreneur Asia Pacific\n\nAnthony Robbins. Early in my career, I was very impatient with anyone who\ndidn't perform: employees and even myself. I once attended Robbins' seminar,\nAwaken the Giant Within. Since that day (18 years ago), I have held the belief\nthat every person has his or her potential for greatness, not only of myself,\nbut everyone around me.\n\n## LIM EE LING, CEO, Smarter Me, Singapore\n\n![LIM EE LING, CEO, Smarter Me,\nSingapore](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/20190216100252-EeLingLimCEO002.jpeg?width=1000)\n\nImage credit: Entrepreneur Asia Pacific\n\nLi Ka-shing. Apart from his rags-to-riches story, which is inspiring, it is\nhis thirst for knowledge -- how he believes that no one is born to be dumb,\nthat your life can be changed through constant learning. And his emphasis on\nthe value of working hard, which can compensate for some of our weaknesses.\n\n## AMIT RAMANI, CEO-founder, Awfis, India\n\n![AMIT RAMANI, CEO-founder, Awfis,\nIndia](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/20190216100348-AmitRamaniAwfis.jpeg?width=1000)\n\nImage credit: Entrepreneur Asia Pacific\n\nKapil Dev. His entrepreneurial spirit, passion and go-getter attitude of\ntaking calculated risks has inspired me in many ways, and laid the foundation\nfor me to become a first- generation entrepreneur.\n\n## CHEETUNG LEONG,Co-founder, EngageRocket, Singapore\n\n![CHEETUNG LEONG,Co-founder, EngageRocket,\nSingapore](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/20190216100418-CheeTungLeongEngageRocketCEO0042.jpeg?width=1000)\n\nImage credit: Entrepreneur Asia Pacific\n\nLeonardo da Vinci. His curiosity and achievements in diverse areas inspired my\ninterest in many different fields of study. He tied everything to logic and\nempiricism, a remarkable commitment to using data that I appreciate deeply.\n\n## GABRIELE FADDA, Co-founder, SmartBite, Kuala Lumpur\n\n![GABRIELE FADDA, Co-founder, SmartBite, Kuala\nLumpur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/20190216100501-GabrieleFaddaCEOandCo-\nFounder1.jpeg?width=1000)\n\nImage credit: Entrepreneur Asia Pacific\n\nBill Gates. I really admire him for his attitude and what he has accomplished.\nHe has this quote which I love and have adopted as part of my work: \"Your most\nunhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.\"\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

Hong Kong and Malaysia\nfollowed, both improving to C+ from C- previously.\n\nAssessing retirement systems across the sub-indices of adequacy,\nsustainability and integrity, Singapore topped the adequacy index in Asia--\nwhich measures benefits, savings, tax support, home ownership, and growth in\nassets among others.\n\n**Also read** : [Lack of security threatens Singapore's dominance in\nretirement finance](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/lack-security-\nthreatens-singapores-dominance-in-retirement-finance)\n\nHong Kong's governance, regulation, and operating costs were hailed across\nAsia, ranking fourth out of 37 retirement systems globally in the integrity\nsub-index.\n\nIn Asia, D-grade systems were China (48.7), India (45.8), Japan (48.3), Korea\n(49.8). Joining them are newcomers Philippines (43.7) and Thailand (39.4),\nwith Thailand having the lowest index value of all the systems studied.\nIndonesia achieved a C-grade (52.2).\n\nAsia fell 10 points short of the global adequacy average of 50.3, and was also\nnine points below the global integrity average. The region is also 2.3 points\nbelow the global sustainability average of 50.4.\n\nAlthough Asia' retirement systems \"were on the right track,\" the region's\ngovernments, employers, and individuals are called to consider sustaining\nintergenerational retirement systems which would not put undue burden onto\nfuture generations, said Janet Li, Mercer's wealth business leader for Asia.\n\nLi added that whilst each system is different, there are common denominators\nthat they should all consider. \"This includes increasing the minimum level of\nsupport for our poorest aged individuals, ensuring that a portion of\nretirement benefits is taken as an income stream, and raising the age at which\nolder people can access their retirement savings in line with increasing life\nexpectancy,\" she said.\n\nThe Netherlands recorded the highest index value (81.0), and has consistently\nheld first or second position for 10 of the past 11 MMGPI reports.\n\nFor each sub-index, the highest scores were Ireland for adequacy (81.5),\nDenmark for sustainability (82.0) and Finland for integrity (92.3). The lowest\nscores were Thailand for adequacy (35.8), Italy for sustainability (19.0) and\nPhilippines for integrity (34.7).\n\nThe MMGPI compares retirement systems across the globe and covers almost two-\nthirds of the world's population. It is is a collaborative research project\nbetween the Monash Centre for Financial Studies (MCFS)--a research centre\nbased within Monash Business School at Monash University in Melbourne--and\nprofessional services firm, Mercer, and is supported by the Victorian\nGovernment of Australia.\n\nThis year's report documented the \"wealth effect\", or the tendency for\nspending to increase with rising wealth, in relation to pension assets.\nMMGPI's data suggests that as pension assets increase, individuals feel\nwealthier and therefore are likely to borrow more.\n\n\"As the wealth of an individual grows, whether it be in home ownership,\ninvestment portfolios or their retirement savings, so does their comfort with\namassing debt. The evidence suggests that on a global basis, for every extra\ndollar a person has in pension assets, their net household debt rises by just\nunder 50 cents,\" Dr. David Knox, author of the study, noted.\n\nProfessor Deep Kapur, Director of the MCFS, said the move away from defined\nbenefit schemes towards defined contribution plans was playing an increasingly\nimportant role in the accumulation of individuals' retirement savings.\n\"Maximising risk-adjusted investment returns for defined contribution plans by\ndiversifying the assets held by a pension fund is critical,\" he said.\n\n\"It's essential the state pension or retirement age is reconsidered in line\nwith increasing longevity - a step some governments have already taken - to\nreduce the costs of publicly financed pension benefits.\"\n\nDo you know more about this story?

cuts\n\nAnd private equity firm Elite Partners Capital invests $3m in TAG Sensors.\n\n_**From Bloomberg:**_\n\n> Temasek Holdings may report its first decline to $300b in assets under\n> management since 2016 as global trade uncertainties and volatile equity\n> markets take their toll, according to CIMB Private Banking economist Song\n> Seng Wun, who has been covering Temasek for over a decade.\n>\n> Singapore's state investor had $308b (US$226b) in AUM as of March 2018.\n>\n> Investors globally are facing a tough environment as the trade war between\n> China and the US clouds the market outlook and other issues like Brexit dent\n> returns. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC last week said overhyped\n> valuations in developed markets were also a concern.\n>\n> Whilst an AUM decline in that vicinity would be within the range envisaged\n> by Temasek in its 2018 annual report, it would only represent the fund's\n> third fall in a decade (AUM dipped in 2016 and again in 2009 during the\n> global financial crisis).\n>\n> Read more [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/temasek-\n> s-assets-seen-falling-on-global-stock-market-volatility?srnd=premium-asia).\n\n_**From CNBC:**_\n\n> Whole teams in Deutsche Bank's Asian operations, which includes Singapore,\n> Hong Kong and Australia, were told their positions were gone as the lender\n> began axing 18,000 jobs globally in one of the biggest overhauls to an\n> investment bank.\n>\n> The German bank launched the restructuring on Sunday in 7 July, outlining a\n> plan that will ultimately cost $11.3b (US$8.31b) and see it dramatically\n> scale back its investment bank - a major retreat after years of working to\n> compete as a major force on Wall Street.\n>\n> As part of the overhaul, the bank will scrap its global equities business\n> and also cut some of its fixed income operations - an area traditionally\n> regarded as one of its strengths.\n>\n> Whilst the bulk of the 18,000 job losses are widely expected to fall in\n> Europe and the United States.\n>\n> Deutsche Bank gave no geographic breakdown for the job cuts when it\n> announced the plan.\n>\n> Read more [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/07/reuters-america-deutsche-\n> bank-axes-whole-teams-in-asia-pacific-as-18000-job-cuts-begin.html).\n\n_**From e27:**_\n\n> Singapore-based private equity firm Elite Partners Capital (EPC) has\n> invested $3m (US$2.2m) in Norwegian cold chain management specialist TAG\n> Sensors.\n>\n> In addition to the funding, EPC's Elite InNorvate Growth LP, a Singapore-\n> based fund dedicated to investments in Norwegian growth companies, has\n> signed the agreement for a significant minority stake in TAG Sensors.\n>\n> TAG Sensors will set up its Asian headquarters in Singapore to recruit local\n> talent, set up IT infrastructure, and IP protection. With the deal, EPC will\n> leverage on its network and resources to help TAG Sensors expand in Asia.\n>\n> TAG Sensors provides solutions to track and log the temperature of\n> perishable and sensitive products, both in storage and during\n> transportation.\n>\n> Read more [here](https://e27.co/elite-partners-capital-invests-us2-2m-into-\n> norwegian-cold-chain-tech-company-20190708/ ).\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Asian countries ranked in the bottom half of the resilience index.\n\nSingapore was crowned as the most resilient nation to [societal\nageing](https://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/chart-day-elderly-\nbecome-25-singapores-population-2030) and automation in Asia even as all\ncountries in the region occupy the bottom half of an index released by Mercer\nand Marsh & McLennan Insights.\n\n**Also read** : [Singapore healthcare spending to hit US$24.6b by\n2020](https://sbr.com.sg/healthcare/news/singapores-healthcare-expenditure-\nhit-us246b-2020)\n\nOn a global scale, the nation ranked 13th out of 20, with a score of 14.6 in\nthe Ageing and Automation Resilience Index.Denmark, Australia and Sweden held\nthe top three spots, with scores of 20.4, 20.3 and 20.0 respectively.\n\nElderly Singaporean workers have the highest disproportionate risk of\nautomation than younger workers, compared to other major global economies. By\n2030, 35% of the working-age population in Singapore is expected to be above\nthe age of 50.\n\n**Also read** : [Singapore PM warns that healthcare spending is rising faster\nthan GDP](https://sbr.com.sg/healthcare/news/singapore-pm-warns-healthcare-\nspending-rising-faster-gdp-0)\n\nRegional neighbours Japan, China and South Korea placed 17th, 19th and 20th\nrespectively, scoring 8.9, 7.4 and 7.1.\n\n\"Failing to reinvest the returns from automation into workers would of course\ncreate serious fallouts: social and income inequality will increase, as will\nretirement savings gaps and pressures on pension systems,\" the report's\nauthors wrote.\n\nThe index is based on the factors a country has in place to deal with societal\nageing and automation, like a higher older worker labour force participation,\nan adequate level of pension fund assets, favourable socio-economic\nconditions, and appropriate policy and legal conditions, as well as the\nstrength of their local retirement system.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

_**Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, quad-camera setup for RM2,399**_\n  * _**Flagship smartphone also includes 50W super-fast charge**_\n\n\n\n![\\(From left\\) realme Malaysia brand manager Tiffany Teh; realme Malaysia CEO\nHunter Wang; Qualcomm Malaysia country manager & senior director Goh Thih\nLiang; Lazada Malaysia brand manager Max wong; and realme Malaysia product\nmanager KC Har\n](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/realme%20X2%20Pro%20launch.jpg)\n\nJUST in time for the holiday season, realme has launched the realme X2 Pro in\nMalaysia. This flagship device from the Shenzhen-based smartphone maker comes\nequipped with the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor alongside a\n64MP \"Hawk-Eye\" quad-camera setup.\n\n\"We are glad to be launching this amazing device in Malaysia. For the past two\nmonths, we've been hearing from our friends, media and realme fans as they are\nexpecting to get their hands on realme's strongest and best value flagship\nsmartphone - the realme X2 Pro. This full speed flagship device is a result of\nrealme's Dare to Leap attitude as we believe strongly in offering customers\naccess to leap-forward performance,\" said realme Malaysia's brand manager\nTiffany Teh during the launch.\n\nThe octa-core Snapdragon 855 Plus processor forms the core of the X2 Pro, with\nits Adreno 640 GPU that allows the processor to work 15% faster in graphics\nrendering compared to the base version of the Snapdragon 855. If anything, the\nX2 Pro sounds like a great device for gaming - its Dolby Atmos Dual Stereo\nSpeakers certainly helps make it so.\n\nThe smartphone also sports a 4,000mAh battery, on top of what the company\ncalls an AI cooling technology that detects applications that are not utilised\nfrequently and subsequently stops them from running to save battery.\n\nMore impressively, the realme X2 Pro supports 50W SuperVOOC Flash Charge via\nUSB-C. With this, the company says that the phone can go from 0% battery life\nto 100% in just 35 minutes. The charging mechanics are protected by an\n\"intelligent five-core chip system\", which provides real-time monitoring of\nthe electrical current.\n\n**Four for the count**\n\n\n\n![realme gets real, launches flagship X2 Pro smartphone in\nMalaysia](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/realme%20X2%20Pro%20back.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe realme X2 Pro sports a 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen with a 91.7%\nscreen-to-body ratio. The display is a 90Hz Ultra Smooth Display, which is\nclaimed to have earned Full Care Display Certification TUV Rheinland for low-\nbrightness stroboscopic and low blue light protection (better for the eyes).\n\nSitting in the little teardrop notch on top of the screen is a 16MP selfie\nshooter that comes with a bunch of AI beautification functions. At the rear,\nhowever, are four cameras: a 64MP main camera, an 8MP 115-degrees wide-angle\nlens, a 13MP telephoto lens and a 2MP portrait lens. This module, we're told,\nuses Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 1/1.72 sensor.\n\nThe rear cameras are able to record 4K image resolution videos, a capability\npaired with the UIS anti-shake algorithm and a built-in gyroscope to correct\nhand movements or shaking in real-time. Additionally, the X2 Pro can also take\nreal-time videos with blurring effects and 960fps slow-motion videos.\n\nThe realme X2 Pro prices at US$574.40 (RM2,399).

likely to trim its current\nheadcount.\n\nAbout one in 10 (13%) of employers expressed plans to expand their headcount\nin the fourth quarter of 2019, bringing the resulting net employment outlook\nto its weakest in two years at +4%, according to the latest survey by\nManpowerGroup.\n\nAccordingly, 8% of employers surveyed expect a decrease whilst 77% expect no\nchange in their payroll. Hiring prospects declined by 7 ppt compared to the\nprevious quarter and is 8 ppt weaker compared to the same time last year.\n\n\"Anticipating that business will be affected by the economic downturn,\ncompanies are limiting their hiring activity. Some companies are also turning\nto upskilling their employees instead of hiring new staff,\" said Linda Teo,\ncountry manager of ManpowerGroup Singapore.\n\n**Also read:** [Technical recession risks heighten over dismal GDP\ngrowth](https://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/technical-recession-risks-heighten-\nover-dismal-gdp-growth)\n\nCompared to Q4 2018, hiring intentions are notably weakened in all seven\nindustry sectors, the report noted. The public administration and education\nsector employers report a 17 ppt decline, although it remains the strongest\nlabor market with an outlook of +19%. Additionally, the outlook for the\nmanufacturing sector decreased by 12 ppt to 0%, its weakest hiring outlook in\na decade.\n\nOn the other hand, the transportation and utilities sector expects to trim its\nheadcount as its outlook crashed 13ppt to -5% QoQ in Q4 compared to the\nprevious quarter. Outlook in this sector crashed 12 ppt in the fourth quarter\ncompared to Q4 2018.\n\nFurthermore, hiring intentions are considerably weaker in the services sector\nwhere employers reported a decline of 16 ppt to +2% QoQ, its weakest in 10\nyears. Meanwhile, the finance, insurance and real estate sector's outlook fell\nby 9 ppt in Q4 compared to the same quarter the previous year, according to\nManpowerGroup.\n\nElsewhere, employers in the mining and construction sector as well as the\nwholesale and retail trade sector expect moderate hiring activity, with\noutlooks at +10% and +8%, respectively.\n\nDespite the weaker outlooks, Teo noted that pockets of opportunity exist as\nemployers are still hiring to fill skill gaps in their workforce.\n\n**Also read** : [Local technology and banking hiring to persist in\n2019](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/local-technology-and-banking-\nhiring-persist-in-2019)\n\n\"Job seekers, especially IT talent, with trending skills such as digital\nmarketing and blockchain will find it easier to secure a job as companies move\ntowards digitising their processes,\" she added.\n\nThe ManpowerGroup Outlook Survey forecasted payroll for all eight Asia Pacific\ncountries and territories surveyed in the next three months. Hiring plans also\nreportedly improved in three countries and territories when compared with Q3\n2019 but weakened in four. The strongest labor market in the region was\nanticipated by Japanese employers for the sixth consecutive quarter, whilst\nthe weakest outlooks were reported in both China and Singapore, according to\nthe report.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

the most desirable industries, according to\nrespondents.\n\nSingapore beat big economies such as Mainland China, North America, and Europe\nto become the top pick for relocation if given the option amongst global\njobseekers, a study by firm RGF International Recruitment found.\n\nWith an average monthly income of $4,437, the study found that Singapore's\nhealthy environment for multinational corporations and its nurturing approach\ntowards startups make it an alluring employment location for both locals and\nforeigners. The Lion City is the most popular relocation destination for\nworking professionals hailing from Indonesia (38%), Thailand (34%), Malaysia\n(32.5%), Japan (30%), and India (29%).\n\n**Also read:**  [Expat living is cheaper in Singapore than Hong\nKong](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-services/in-focus/expat-living-cheaper-in-\nsingapore-hong-kong-study)\n\nIn particular, the healthcare and life sciences and technology, and the tech,\ninternet and telco sectors have been found to be the most desirable industries\nto work in. This, according to the report, comes as no surprise amidst the\nnation's mandate towards digitalisation and the Ministry of Health looking to\nfill 300,000 positions.\n\nAmongst the job-seeking talents in Singapore, six in 10 said that they were\nlured into the market due to financial compensation. Meanwhile, top calibre\ncolleagues (13.8%) and career advancement opportunities (10.8%) were also\ncited as factors for trying to land a job in the Lion City. Additionally, the\nstudy found that whilst expats are willing to work in Singapore, Singaporeans\nare not keen to become expats except for those who want to try working in\nMainland China (21%).\n\n**Also read:**  [Singapore expat pay package hit $325,000 in\n2018](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/singapore-expat-pay-package-\nhit-325000-in-2018)\n\nOn the employer side, sentiments are highly positive when it comes to business\ngrowth and hiring plans as more than half (53%) were optimistic whilst 47%\nclassified themselves as neutral about business growth. It is also the only\ncountry covered by the study with no respondents stating a pessimistic\noutlook.\n\n\"This optimism translates into aggressive hiring plans for 57.9% of local\nrespondents, who aim to expand headcounts in the coming year,\" the study said.\n\nDespite their optimism on hiring and business growth, 84% of employers\nrevealed that the struggle to attract key talent is still their biggest hiring\nchallenge. Coming in a distant second and third place are company culture\nmismatch (12.4%) and low hiring budget (10%).\n\nDo you know more about this story?

learning opportunities from company:\nsurvey\n\nTwo in five employees have resigned from a company that didn't deliver L&D\nopportunities they expected.\n\nCompanies need to be able to provide sufficient learning and development (L&D)\nopportunities for employees as only 17% of workers express satisfaction over\ntheir current company's L&D offerings, LinkedIn reveals in its Future of\nSkills 2019 Report.\n\n**Also read** : [Banks are at the forefront of Singapore's upskilling\ncharge](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/in-focus/banks-are-forefront-\nsingapores-future-ready-upskilling-charge)\n\nThe survey revealed that two in five employees have left a company that failed\nto deliver on the L&D opportunities they seek. This issue is further\naggravated by a mismatch between the company offerings and the desires of\nemployees who seek opportunities to improve their skills.\n\nCurrently, the top 10 rising skills in APAC are dominated by technology-\nrelated skills with the top 3 in Singapore's workforce being blockchain,\nworkflow automation and human-centred design.\n\nAt the same time, employees and L&D professionals also understand the\nincreasing importance of soft skills in determining career progression. In the\nreport, 62% of employees and 54% of L&D professionals in Singapore see soft\nskills such as creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving as playing a\nvital role.\n\nOf the employee respondents, 57% cited time as the most significant barrier\npreventing them from undertaking L&D activities at work, although cost,\naccessibility, access to resources and general level of interest in the\ncontent also play a role.\n\n\"It is therefore important for organisations to have a deep understanding of\ntheir current talent pool, and how to evolve it for their long-term business\ngoals. Helping current talent to upskill or reskill early can help\norganisations ensure that their future talent needs are met,\" Feon Ang, vice\npresident for talent and learning solutions, Asia Pacific, LinkedIn shares.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

July, four business and client units will report to CEO Loh Boon\nChye.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) has formed a new organisation structure to pursue\ngrowth opportunities and build scale in multiple asset classes, an\nannouncement revealed.\n\nEffective 1 July, four business and client units, comprising fixed income,\ncurrencies and commodities (FICC), equities (cash & derivatives), data,\nconnectivity and indices (DCI), and global sales and origination (GSO), will\nreport to the CEO.\n\nOver the last decade, the FICC businesses in SGX has reportedly been on a path\nof considerable growth, emerging as a sizable set of asset classes and that\nwill now be combined to form a new business unit.\n\n\"The rising convergence of over-the-counter (OTC) and listed foreign exchange\n(FX) markets, coupled with our standing as Asia's fastest growing and largest\nAsian FX Futures venue, presents us with opportunities to serve the market\nwith innovative and differentiated products,\" the local bourse said.\n\n**Also read:**  [SGX to launch new securities settlement and depository\nsystem](https://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/news/sgx-launch-new-securities-\nsettlement-and-depository-system)\n\nIn commodities, SGX said that it plans to deepen its leading position in Asian\nindustrial commodities and continue to drive synergies between global trade\nand transport marketplaces. As a result, Baltic Exchange and Energy Market\nCompany (EMC), both wholly-owned subsidiaries of SGX, will report into FICC as\nimportant anchors to the physical market in the commodities value chain.\n\nThe unit will be led by Lee Beng Hong, who will be joining SGX on 1 August. In\nthe interim, the CEO will have oversight of the unit.\n\nMeanwhile, SGX's cash equities and equity derivatives businesses will merge to\nform an enlarged platform where retail and institutional clients can access a\ncontinuum of equities products, including all trading, clearing, post-trade\nand research services.\n\n\"By focusing on equities as a single asset class, product and service\ninnovation can span both cash and derivatives channels to address client needs\nholistically,\" the local bourse said, adding that Michael Syn, currently head\nof derivatives, has been appointed as the head of equities.\n\nThe bourse's market data & connectivity unit has been renamed data,\nconnectivity and indices (DCI) to better reflect SGX's full suite of data-\nrelated product and services. Ng Kin Yee will continue to lead DCI.\n\nThe GSO unit combines the equities and debt capital market teams with SGX's\nnine international offices and specialist sales teams. Chew Sutat, currently\nhead of equities & fixed income, will head GSO.\n\n\"These changes will further SGX's future growth as a leading international\nexchange, fluent in multiple asset classes,\" SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate announcement revealed that Muthukrishnan Ramaswami will\nstep down as the SGX's president after 12 years with the local bourse. As a\nmember of the executive management committee of SGX, Ramaswami had direct\noversight of technology, operations, market data and connectivity, as well as\nthe membership and international coverage functions of the SGX group.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

30, 2019  4 min read\n\nSingapore-based venture firm **SeedPlus** started in 2016 with an eye on\nencashing the South Asian (SEA) startup boom.\n\nBacked by Jungle Ventures, SeedPlus roped in **Tiang Lim Foo** as partner.\n**Entrepreneur Asia Pacific** caught up with the ex-Evernote Singapore head to\nlearn more about the seed stage investment firm's plans for SEA.\n\nFoo who served as VP of Product at MoVend in the past has deep product\nknowledge, an expertise he brings on the table while selecting startups for\nfunding.\n\n **Southeast Asia Focus**\n\nIndia and China remain to be hotspots while Southeast Asia will continue to\nbreak out as a region for venture financing, on pace if not exceed\nexpectations says Foo.\n\nAccording to a joint research by Google and Temasek, the Southeast Asian\ninternet economy is projected to be $240 billion by 2025, and SeedPlus is\nseeing signs of acceleration.\n\nThe firm does not invest in China and doesn't actively look for opportunities\nin India as well since the focus of SeedPlus is the Southeast Asia region.\n\n\"There are many learnings to be referenced from China and India that we\ncontinue to look to, in terms of business models and go to market strategies.\nWe are also actively looking for and working on collaboration opportunities\nwith VCs from these regions, as we believe that the more cross pollination of\nideas and investments between ecosystems, the better,\" Foo tells Entrepreneur\nAsia Pacific.\n\n![](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1564410512_tiang.JPG?width=1000)\n\nAmong the key interest areas Foo is most excited about are the application of\ndata and technology to solve problems at scale.\n\nFor example, in Southeast Asia, there exist huge gaps in understanding human\nand people analytics to enable managers and leaders to build better companies.\nThis can be achieved by using technology to acquire and analyse data better\nand more timely. Better and more timely data ultimately translates to higher\nquality and actionable feedback for people managers and hopefully, creating\nbetter working environments and higher quality companies.\n\nAnother example could be to address legacy industries like the insurance\nindustry. How do we make insurance smarter, more accessible and personalised,\nby leveraging data and technology?\n\n **Strategy**\n\nIf you think of talent and capital as the core ingredients of a healthy tech\nstartup ecosystem, you will see that two factors have grown healthily in the\npast decade says Foo.\n\n\"We see more founding and digital talent starting companies and looking at the\nentrepreneurial path as a career choice; we also see more VC funds coming\nashore Singapore. There's no data to suggest the growth wouldn't continue. I\nam very bullish on the long term potential of the startup ecosystem in\nSingapore and the region,\" Foo says.\n\nFoo considers SeedPlus as company builders as opposed to company financiers.\n\nThe most important question for SeedPlus is how does it partner with founders\nat the earliest days of the start-up journey, and work with them to build the\ncompany and create value.\n\n\"Too many a times you see VC's forgetting the 'venture' aspect of the job;\nthat this is a highly entrepreneurial activity. Being able to work with smart\nand highly driven entrepreneurs to create the enterprises of tomorrow is\ndefinitely one of the most exciting aspect,\" says Foo.\n\n **3 tips for startups looking for funding from SeedPlus**\n\nFor founders who are raising the first seed or institutional round, i will\nadvise them to look for an investor who understands their business and is able\nto provide support over the long term. People talk about product market fit,\nbut I don't think we as an industry talk enough about founder VC fit. Having\nthe right investors doesn't guarantee success of course but have investors who\naren't aligned with you and your business will guarantee certain failure.\n\nSeedPlus' investments include the likes of Moglix, Homage, Qoala, CardUp,\nNeuron Mobility and Travelstop. Foo currently serves on the board of Qoala,\nEngageRocket and CardUp, amongst others.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

of the coronavirus outbreak put the brakes on the MWC\n2020 edition. At first, the MWC organisers, the GSM Association [put on a\nbrave front](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/gsma-statement-on-\ncoronavirus-2/) and said that despite the spread of the virus in January, the\nshow will go on.\n\nThe GSMA pledged to carefully follow and adhere to the recommendations from\nthe World Health Organisation (WHO), the Chinese government, and all Spanish\nhealth authorities. It confirmed on Jan 29 that registrations had not been\naffected up to that point.\n\nStill defiant about not shuttering the show, the GSMA reiterated its stance\nthat it will continue to keep the MWC 2020 opened with a litany of\n[precautions in place](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/statement/gsma-update-on-\ncoronavirus-2/). Then on Feb 10, AWS pulled out from MWC 2020, following other\nplayers such as South Korea's LG Electronics, Swedish telco gear maker\nEricsson and US chipmaker Nvidia Corp, [Reuters\nreported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-mobileworld-amazon-\ncom/amazon-pulls-out-of-major-barcelona-telecoms-conference-over-coronavirus-\nidUSKBN2030QV).\n\nFinally, the GSMA surrendered and called off the mega event on Feb 12, with\nits CEO John Hoffman, saying [it had cancelled MWC\n2020](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/gsma-statement-on-mwc-\nbarcelona-2020/) because \"of global concern regarding the coronavirus\noutbreak, travel concerns and other circumstances, making it impossible for\nthe GSMA to hold the event.\"\n\nThe impact of such a cancellation can't be overstated. [According to\nFastCompany](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/barcelona-\ntakes-a-hit-as-mobile-world-congress-canceled-on-virus), some 100,000 visitors\nwere expected to descend on Barcelona, spending everything from accommodation\nto food and beverage.\n\nThe total spending at the conference in 2019 was US$513 million (RM2.14\nbillion). Some 14,000 temporary workers were expected to be working during the\nweek, which would have boosted the local economy and the ecosystem surrounding\nthe hospitality industry.\n\n\"The cancellation of MWC Barcelona puts the mobile industry into uncharted\nwaters,\" Frank Gillett, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester\n[said](https://www.windowscentral.com/what-mobile-world-congress-cancellation-\nmeans-industry). \"There's no way to make up for all the social, in-person\nconversations that are oxygen for the competitive mobile industry.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gartner research's Meghan Rimol [told Windows\nCentral](https://www.windowscentral.com/what-mobile-world-congress-\ncancellation-means-industry) that \"events [at MWC 2020] give tech companies\nthe ability to engage with buyers firsthand and potentially accelerate\nopportunities.\"\n\nAnd the BBC reported that smaller telco ecosystem-based firms were badly\naffected by the cancellation, such as Connectlab which makes Internet\nconnected devices. The firm had reportedly spent some \u20ac50,000 euros\n(US$55,700) on the conference.\n\nBen Wood of CCS Insight [told the\nBBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51491381) that many smaller firms\nmight be considering whether to attend next year because \"they have had to\nswallow many of the costs from this year's show\".\n\n\"The GSMA now needs to be careful that there is not a knock-on effect from\nthis year's cancellation,\" he said. \"Major companies and many attendees will\nbe reviewing the importance of MWC to their business and the GSMA must work\nhard to have a clear path forward.\"\n\n**Launching anyway**\n\n![Effects of Coronavirus still unknown, as tech giants soldier\non](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Huawei%20X.png)\n\nWhile the fallout of calling off the MWC 2020 isn't exactly clear yet, tech\ngiant Huawei soldiered on. On Feb 24, it [launched\n](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/press/news/2020/huawei-launched-huawei-mate-\nxs-2020/)a revamped version of its foldable phone, the Huawei Mate Xs. It\n[unveiled](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/personal-tech/foldable-\ndevice-5g-join-chorus-hype-mwc) its debut foldable smartphone, the Mate X,\nlast year with much pomp at MWC 2019 on Feb 27.\n\nIt came off the back of rival Samsung Technologies Co Ltd, which launched its\nGalaxy Fold a week before that. The original Galaxy Fold was a flop because of\na [litany of issues](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/is-samsungs-galaxy-fold-\nalready-a-flop), and so Samsung went back to the drawing board. Samsung\nfinally introduced the Galaxy Fold to the world in September last year.\n\n_**READ MORE:[Review: Galaxy Fold: Let the foldable games\nbegin](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/personal-tech/review-galaxy-fold-let-\nfoldable-games-begin)**_\n\nThe problems Samsung faced prompted Huawei to relook at its launch date for\nthe Mate X. Eventually, it only released the Mate X late in 2019 in November,\nand only in China, its home market.\n\nWith similar design cues from the Mate X, the Huawei Mate Xs will be launched\noutside its home market. The company [made an\nannouncement](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=644537346292922) noting that\nit is expected to arrive in Malaysia on Mac 20.\n\nHuawei claims to have addressed the core of problems foldable smartphones\nface, namely a more durable hinge to withstand frequent folding. It also\n[upgraded](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15523/huawei-announces-mate-xs-\nrevised-2nd-gen-foldable) its internals to include the newer generation Kirin\n990 chip, which makes it 5G-ready.\n\nThe key difference however is that the Mate Xs will not have Google's software\necosystem, commonly known as [Google Mobile\nServices](https://www.android.com/gms/) (GMS), which is the heartbeat of every\nAndroid smartphone outside of its Android operating system. But this,\naccording to Counterpoint Research, is a problem.\n\nThe lack of GMS is far from excellent,\"\n[said](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/huawei-unfolding-drama/) Peter\nRichardson, research director at Counterpoint. \"This means the product is\nlikely more or less unsaleable outside of China.\"\n\nRichardson also noted that the Mate X's outward-folding screen means that the\nscreen is vulnerable to damage unless placed inside a case.\n\n\"We noted that one of the demo devices already had scratches on the surface of\nthe display, despite Huawei adding additional layers to the screen,\" he\nobserved.\n\nHe added that the battleground of foldable phones may shift towards foldable\nclamshell designs, such as the ones introduced by Motorola in its latest Razr\nsmartphone and Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.\n\n\"The original Mate X was, arguably, a far better design than Samsung's Galaxy\nFold. However the clamshell design of the Z Flip has a lot of positives -\ninherent screen protection and buyer familiarity.\n\n\"That Huawei is still refining the outwardly folding, and vulnerable, Mate X\ndesign suggests that it sees a future in this form factor [but] we're less\ncertain.\"\n\n![Effects of Coronavirus still unknown, as tech giants soldier\non](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/01_018_galaxyzflip_mainkv_mirror_purple_2p_rgb.jpg)\n\n**Flip smartphones**\n\nSpeaking about clamshell design flip smartphones, the reborn Motorola Razr was\nthe first to market with this form factor. The new foldable Razr boasted of\nthe ability to not show its crease lines where the fold of the screen is,\nthanks to a unique design, [reports CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/motorola-\nrazr-folds-in-half-without-crease-secret-hinge-design/).\n\nHowever, as innovative as that design was, there were reports on several\ndifferent tech news portals - [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/does-our-\nmotorola-razr-fold-test-mean-this-phone-wont-last-year-not-quite/), [Ars\nTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/just-one-day-after-launch-\nmoto-razr-durability-problems-begin-to-pile-up/) and\n[BGR](https://bgr.com/2020/02/18/motorola-razr-screen-damage-foldable-display-\npeeling-off-at-the-hinge/) - claiming that the Razr's hinges weren't as\ndurable as advertised.\n\nMotorola particularly wasn't happy with the way CNET conducted its test on the\nRazr and came back noting that the hinge stopped functioning after \"27,000\nfolds.\" It issued a response, claiming that the machine used to test the\nfolding was simply not designed to test its device.\n\n\"Any tests run utilising this machine will put undue stress on the hinge and\nnot allow the phone to open and close as intended, making the test inaccurate.\n\n\"The important thing to remember is that Razr underwent extensive cycle\nendurance testing during product development, and CNET's test is not\nindicative of what consumers will experience when using Razr in the real-\nworld.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung's latest flip foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Flip, has\nreceived some mixed initial impressions from a number of sources. The Verge's\n[Dieter Bohn noted](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-\ngalaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price) that while\nthe Z Flip had a number of plus points including a great performance and\ndecent battery life, there are still issues with the display, including the\nscreen being susceptible to scratches.\n\n[Engadget's Chris Velazco](https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/21/samsung-galaxy-\nz-flip-\nreview/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALPh_FMhhK6o_-\nJFVoUG88qz3RQIoBwczBHQ1_nI8KXJBtL4tqawukx-\njbd3dAGPi39HtgDDHYQbOAjeu8Bt0VjA0-0XLBEq6iotnTMDIOhILZLxDRs1fdtK0kRPMndiObAJcwft74AOHv6N_Q5AxG62UPtqtd8EnpTIrcVBMnd3)\nnoted that there isn't a hurry to get a flip smartphone yet because \"embracing\nthat future means putting up with a lot of compromises and that even though\nthe Z Flip has fewer than most, the same lingering foldable criticisms apply.\"\n\n![Effects of Coronavirus still unknown, as tech giants soldier\non](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/MWC%20front%20image.jpg)\n\n**Forecasts gloom**\n\nSo the MWC 2020 didn't happen with coronavirus slowing things down with most\nmajor brands hunkering down and bracing for the worst. Yet, that's not\nstopping companies from marching forward as some brands are doing what they\ncan to push their wares forward.\n\nThe more alarming trend is how this near-pandemic will hit tech companies in\nthe longer run. [Apple Inc](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/apple-will-miss-\nrevenue-forecast-as-coronavirus-impacts-its-manufacturing-\nsales/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMPvuVvuEo2GTB_bs6sc-6Tl60MOm3w8OgIGiTgYDOonkdvcO7zp9G-vP9ceehboXQzo7lsRfEewrvWUkfKuwXMAek112ZVVM2O_wQuvc-\nlcIq0zoxblwyu6Omu_1Gk8y-hCVs_IAMK-6nQ6cAi7vCFOb7a-fDMWnGY0hqDeBiZv) and\n[Microsoft Corp](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/microsoft-warns-it-will-miss-\nguidance-for-segment-that-includes-windows-because-of-coronavirus.html) have\nalready warned about missing their respective next quarter numbers. [Other\nindustries](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-\nleads-to-worst-week-for-markets-since-financial-crisis) are also facing the\nbrunt of this impact.\n\nAccording to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/coronavirus-\nhow-to-secure-your-supply-chain/), the full impact of coronavirus on supply\nchains might not become obvious until sometime in the next few months and\nbeyond. However, supply chain leaders should take initial steps now to monitor\nand prepare for the impact on their value chain.\n\n[Commenting](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-sales-\ndramatically-fall-q1-2020-shadow-ncov-novel-coronavirus-\nepidemic/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletterfeb14-20&utm_source=Counterpoint+Research+Newsletter&utm_campaign=82e4fafc3b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_14_10_21&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0c8d75a0f8-82e4fafc3b-86033585)\non impact of the Coronavirus on the Chinese smartphone market, Brady Wang,\nassociate director at Counterpoint Research, said, \"Demand-wise, we see the\nmarket impacted severely. We estimate more than a 50% y-o-y decline in offline\nsmartphone sales during the lock-down period.\n\nCCS Insight, another analyst firm,\n[noted](https://www.ccsinsight.com/blog/assessing-the-coronavirus-fallout-for-\ntech/) the technology industry leans heavily on macroeconomic growth and the\neffect of the virus outbreak on the global economy is still unknown.\n\nThe two main short-term concerns are firstly, the demand in China and\nsecondly, the global supply chain, said Marina Koytcheva, vice president of\nforecasting for CCS Insight.\n\n\"The demand for technology products, particularly hardware, in China has\nfallen significantly. Sales in physical stores have been badly hurt, as many\nstores have been closed for a prolonged period of time, with some still\nclosed.\n\nThe second short-term business concern for the tech sector is the disruption\nto the global supply chain, argues Koytcheva.\n\n\"As it stands, we expect that supply constraints will lead to shortages of\nsome technology products worldwide.\n\n\"Some products will be more affected than others.. newer, more innovative\nproducts are likely to be more vulnerable, as they rely on some components\nthat will be hard to source from alternative places, at least in the short\nterm,\" she argues.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen in the next two quarters but I believe\nit's safe to say that things are going to get worse before it gets any better.\n\n\n\n\n\n_**For more technology news and the latest updates, follow us  on **_[ _\n**Facebook,**_](https://www.facebook.com/DNewsAsia/)[ _\n**Twitter**_](https://twitter.com/DNewsAsia) _

international bank with harmonised core and no large home market**_\n  * _**Driving innovation with seconded teams, internal sandbox and SC Ventures**_\n\n\n\n![StanChart aims to be a digital bank with a strong human touch\n](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Standard%20Chartered%20group%20chief%20information%20officer%2C%20Michael%20Gorriz.jpg)\n\n\n\n\"WE EITHER work as a fintech, work with fintechs or create our own fintech,\"\nsaid Standard Chartered group chief information officer Michael Gorriz\n_**(pic)**_ , who joined the bank in July 2015. Prior to that, he spent 29\nyears at the multinational automotive corporation, Daimler AG.\n\nResponsible for the banking operations, system development and technology\ninfrastructure underpinning the bank's client services, Gorriz spoke to\nDigital News Asia about innovation in Standard Chartered and its digital\ntransformation journey thus far.\n\nDiving into the question of whether Standard Chartered hopes to one day become\nan entirely virtual bank or still maintain its brick and mortar presence\nthroughout, Gorriz's upfront response was: \"We will have the day-to-day\noperations fully automated but the people in the bank stay aside and come in\nwhen help is needed.\"\n\nAcknowledging that the first banking touchpoint is quickly changing from human\nto digital and that customers have come to expect it, Standard Chartered's\nvision is to become \"a digital bank with a strong human touch\" serving the\nmass affluent and to be the go-to bank for corporates.\n\nBack in 2015, Standard Chartered announced US$3 billion for system and tech\nenhancements, with US$500 million catered towards retail banking. Shedding\nsome light on some early investments to meet regulatory requirements, Gorriz\nsaid: \"This was a whole book of work which absorbed almost half of our whole\ninvestment. This year, we see a lot of conclusion or roll outs of these\nprojects.\"\n\nAlthough he declined to share numbers, Gorriz said a portion is also invested\ninto improving cyber-security resilience and carrying out strategic\ninvestments.\n\n\"While in the beginning it was more of a catch-up, we do not have the funds to\ngo into real exciting stuff like open banking API offerings and the digital\nbanks.\"\n\n**Digital bank vs digital services**\n\nIn Hong Kong, the bank recently secured its virtual banking license from the\nHong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and announced its standalone virtual bank\nset to launch by year end.\n\nAs to drawing a clear distinction between a digital bank and the digital\nservices offered by a bank, Gorriz said: \"Essentially, on a very high level,\nthere is no difference.\"\n\nHowever, he explained that license schemas differ from country to country. \"In\nsome countries, it's possible already to provide a full mobile offering\nwithout a special license. The licensing depends on whether a physical Know\nYour Customer (KYC) is required or customers can be on-boarded fully\nelectronically.\"\n\nThrough its virtual bank, Standard Chartered's target is to attract a specific\naudience of those within the 25 to 35 years of age bracket with \"higher\neducation and growing income\". Looking into its socio-demographic footprint,\nthe bank found that it holds the lowest market share within that age bracket\nand therefore built an offer to capture this age group.\n\nStandard Chartered's strategy in introducing its Hong Kong digital bank was to\nteam up with Hong Kong-based information and technology company, PCCW Limited;\nthe largest telecommunications company in Hong Kong, HKT Limited; and Ctrip\nFinance to access a large customer pool.\n\nOne common perception banks face is that its innovations are often hampered by\nits lack of agility due to size and adding on digital as a layer upon old core\nbanking systems. But in Standard Chartered's case, the bank operates\ninternationally and does not have a big home market. \"We are the only\ninternational bank of size which has a harmonised core.\"\n\nMost of the bank's competitors have one or two large home markets and an\ninternational business. Due to the growth of international banking, many have\nyet to come to grips with harmonising with their core market because of their\nscale. Standard Chartered's core banking system, however, is identical in\nabout 41 out of 45 countries.\n\n\"We have good market shares in a couple of markets, which means we have had\nthe luxury from the beginning to have global systems for most of our\nfunctions. These global systems have been beefed up in the last couple of\nyears to preserve its capability. Put APIs around them and now we have the\npresentation layer that is independent of our core,\" explained Gorriz.\n\nStandard Chartered is able to roll out features speedily country to country\nand one such instance is its recent set up of digital-only retail banks across\nfour African markets. \"We built a new 'skin' but because the core is 90%\nidentical, we were able to roll out this 'skin' within 15 months.\"\n\n**Tripartite effort in innovation**\n\nAs trust in fintechs progressively grows, the convenience offered by banking\nproducts is also increasing simultaneously. \"We have to work like a fintech in\norder to offer the same convenience and speed in the market. One of the main\nKPIs we are driving is the time taken from ideation to the live service.\"\n\nThe bank tracks this duration and has since shortened time taken for retail\nprojects from 22 weeks in the start of the year to 17 weeks today.\n\nWith one of its strategies being to work like a fintech, Gorriz explained: \"We\ngroup our teams in journeys that are made up of roughly 100 to 200 people\naiming to solve a particular customer problem. Organisationally, they are\nseconded from their departments into the team. They are co-located and have\ncommon targets.\"\n\nEach journey consists of people in charge of market research, UX and UI\ndesign, compliance aspects, risk management and developers. This way, Gorriz\nquips, the bank works not just like a fintech but 50 fintechs combined working\non different aspects for the customer.\n\nBut for solutions that already exist in the market outside of the bank,\nStandard Chartered partners with fintechs to tap into their knowledge.\n\"Typically, we use [fintechs] in an internal sandbox environment for about\nhalf a year.\"\n\n\"Within two to three weeks, we are able to test their technology in a safe\nenvironment. If it then turns out to be viable and reasonable, we integrate\nthem,\" he said, adding that these fintechs have to then fulfil all the\nrequirements that the bank also must comply to.\n\nOnce Standard Chartered tests out a fintech solution, the bank may opt to use\nits services or even take an investment stake in the company. Some investments\nto date are in blockchain startup, Ripple; information management company,\nPaxata; and cash distribution startup, soCash.\n\nAs for the role of Standard Chartered's innovation, fintech investment and\nventures unit, SC Ventures, it is focused on \"rewiring the DNA in banking\" to\ndevelop an innovation culture and mindset, deepen capabilities and experiment\nwith new business models through an open platform and network of people and\npartnerships.\n\nIt runs an eXellerator innovation lab network across Singapore, Hong Kong,\nLondon, Kenya and San Francisco: \"There are a few areas where we have to be\neven bolder and think outside the box. The bank might be a little bit too slow\nto go there. So we put our separate team on it and let them run\nindependently.\"\n\nIn fact, this was the approach taken to build the virtual bank in Hong Kong.\n\"We took deliberate decision, cut ties with the mothership and created a new\nteam.\"\n\n\n\n_**For more technology news and the latest updates, follow us  on **_[ _\n**Facebook,**_](https://www.facebook.com/DNewsAsia/)[

PayNow tie-up with an educational institution.\n\nOCBC Bank and Republic Polytechnic's (RP) have jointly launched PayNow,\nenabling students to pay for school fees by scanning a quick-response (QR)\ncode on the student portal with their mobile phones.\n\nRP is the first educational institution to adopt funds transfer service by\nleveraging the bank's Application Programming Interface (API). Building on\nOCBC Bank's previous experiences with the CPF board, the same API enables\nstudents and their parents to pay from bank accounts with any of the nine\nPayNow participating banks to RP.\n\n\"We are pleased to be one of the pioneer agencies to adopt the use of PayNow\nCorporate as an e-payments solution,\" said Ms. Geraldine Ang, chief financial\nofficer of Republic Polytechnic. \"It provides our stakeholders and corporate\npartners with a convenient and secure platform to transact instantaneously\nwith the institution, as part of our digitalisation effort and push towards\nbecoming a Smart Nation.\"\n\nSince its launch in 2017, PayNow has accummulated over 1.4 million\nregistrations with nearly $900m transferred through the system. In August\n2018, [PayNow Corporate was launched](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-\nservices/news/paynow-corporate-goes-live) to enable businesses to pay and\nreceive Singapore Dollar funds instantaneously with the linking of the Unique\nEntity Number (UEN) to their Singapore bank account.\n\nMoving forward, OCBC Bank and RP will explore extending the use of PayNow for\nthe collection of other fees in the future such as hostel fees, overseas trips\nand facility bookings.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

a seed-stage, seven-month Asean accelerator programme**_\n  * _**Applications are open until Aug 4, 2019 for the first cohort**_\n\n\n\n![Accelerating Asia co-founders Craig Dixon \\(left\\) with Amra\nNaidoo](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Craig%20Dixon%2C%20and%20Amra%20Naidoo%20-%20Co-\nFounders%20of%20Accelerating%20Asia.jpg)\n\nTHE Australian Government announced on June 6 that it will partner with\nAccelerating Asia, a regional network of startup programmes, to develop a\nSingapore-based Asean Smart Cities Accelerator (ASCA).\n\nASCA is a first of its kind seven-month startup accelerator programme which is\ndesigned to provide the best possible support for early-stage Southeast Asian\nstartups specialising in future city development, an initiative supported by\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).\n\nASCA is a seed-stage accelerator programme that selects, funds and provides a\ndevelopment programme for smart city startups in Southeast Asia through access\nto regional opportunities, knowledge, networks, and resources.\n\nThe programme is split into two parts beginning with a three month programme\nperiod with weekly activities in Singapore and followed by four months that\nconsists of remote support, a Demo Day as well as a one-week immersion trip.\nWomen entrepreneurs are vital to the success of this programme and are\nencouraged to apply.\n\nAccelerating Asia co-founder Amra Naidoo, said \"Two-thirds of the world's\npopulation will be living in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations'\nrecent report on global urbanisation in 2018. This creates many challenges in\nterms of sustainable development, especially for cities in the Asean region.\"\n\n\"Smart solutions such as ride-hailing super apps, AI-powered transit planning,\ndata-driven disaster assessment and advanced green-building techniques are\nproliferating in the region. We believe startups are uniquely positioned to\ntackle the challenges that these cities face today and in the future.\n\n\"By working closely with cities and government agencies, our objective is to\nfoster a collaborative and progressive ecosystem that we hope will expedite\nthe development and deployment of sustainable smart cities in Southeast Asia,\nwhile creating better connected, more resilient cities that work for\neveryone,\" added Amra.\n\nThe programme is looking for pre-seed or seed-stage startups from all Asean\nmember countries that already have a product or solution and a viable user\nbase. Their focus should be geared towards addressing problems related to\nsustainable development and improvement of city living.\n\nSelected startup founders will be entitled to the following benefits:\n\n  * A structured schedule of impactful sessions including workshops, mentorship meetings, and investor events\n  * US$29,297 (S$40,000) equity-free investment\n  * Access to top quality mentors, investors, and founders including an Entrepreneur in Residence, who will work closely with them throughout the programme\n  * Office space in the city centre of Singapore during the programme\n  * Benefits from partner companies including Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Hubspot and Stripe\n\n\"We are looking for next-generation solutions that can be scaled across\ngrowing urban populations that can improve livelihoods through new business,\ncareer and economic opportunities and more importantly improve access to safe\nand affordable housing, public spaces, infrastructure and transportation.\n\n\"Other key qualifiers include a measure on environmental impacts, resource\nmanagement and general public accessibility,\" said Accelerating Asia co-\nfounder Craig Dixon.\n\nApplications are now open until Aug 4, 2019 with a programme start date set\nfor Sept 30, 2019.

Singapore's Ocean\nTankers gear up for new IMO rules\n\nAnd Singapore chipmakers slash headcounts as semiconductors sales fall 10-12%.\n\n_**From PropertyGuru:**_\n\nLakepoint Condominium has been launched for an en bloc sale priced at $640m.\n\nDeveloped by Jurong Town Corporation, the 36-year-old property comprises 304\nresidential units that range from studio units to penthouses, as well as five\nshop units. It is nestled on a 99-year leasehold site, which has an area of\n52,238 sqm and a plot ratio of 1.4.\n\nThe development is near Jurong Innovation District, Jurong Industrial Park and\nJurong Mega Port. It is a five-minute walk from Lakeside MRT station and is\nclose to shopping malls like Westgate, JEM, IMM and JCube.\n\nJoint marketing agents Strata AMC and SLP International Property Consultants\nnoted that a pre-application feasibility study indicated that the site could\nsupport higher density development on the basis of traffic impact studies.\n\n\"Interested developers are thus encouraged to explore an intensification of\nplot ratio for redevelopment of the site,\" they said.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-\nnews/2019/7/181994/lakepoint-condominium-up-for-en-bloc-sale-for-640m).\n\n_**From Reuters:**_\n\nDemand for low-sulphur marine fuels in Singapore climbed to a record high in\nJune as the shipping industry prepares for the new IMO rules.\n\nWith a little over five months left until stricter marine fuel rules come into\neffect, shippers that own very large crude carriers, like Ocean Tankers, have\nstarted testing out lower sulphur fuel to prepare their fleet for the\ntransition.\n\nNew International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules prohibiting ships from\nusing fuels containing more than 0.5% sulphur, compared with 3.5% currently,\nwill start on 1 January 2020, as a way to combat air pollution.\n\nThe move will affect fuel supplies to more than 50,000 merchant ships\nglobally. Shippers will have to either invest in exhaust cleaning systems,\nknown as scrubbers, to continue using cheaper high-sulphur fuels, or burn more\nexpensive oil products, such as very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and marine\ngasoil, or use liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\nRead more [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-shipping-\noil/counting-down-to-2020-singapores-ocean-tankers-tests-imo-compliant-fuel-\nidUSKCN1UJ36P).\n\n**_From Reuters:_**\n\nCaught between ongoing trade disputes, concerns over Chinese telecoms firm\nHuawei and slowing consumer demand, chipmakers in Singapore have started\nslowing production and laying off hundreds of jobs, firms told Reuters.\n\nThe slump in a sector that made up nearly a third of Singapore's manufacturing\noutput last year is reinforcing expectations that the export-driven economy\ncould slide into recession in the coming months.\n\nMaking microchips for everything from cell phones to cars has long been\ncentral to the success of Singapore, the tiny trading island seen as a\nbellwether for the global economy.\n\n\"We are already seeing that this downturn is different,\" said Ang Wee Seng,\nexecutive director for the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association\n(SSIA).\n\nAng said he was \"preparing for the worst\" and putting his staff on standby to\nhelp any laid off workers try and find new jobs.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-economy-\nchipmakers-exclusiv/exclusive-bearing-brunt-of-trade-war-singapore-chipmakers-\ncut-jobs-idUSKCN1UJ0PW).  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?

_**Pros: good performance and battery life, solid camera, pure Android experience**_\n  * _**Cons: a lower-resolution screen that is hard to ignore**_\n\n\n\n![Review: Xiaomi\u2019s Mi A3 is a solid one, even if it leaves you\nwanting](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Xiomi%20Mi%20A3%20main.jpg)\n\n\n\nXIAOMI'S Mi A1, the first Android One device from the Chinese tech company,\nwas one of the most easily-recommendable smartphones of 2017 - a perfect\nbalance of good tech and attractive pricing with the added bonus of being as\npure an Android experience as you can get. If premium flagship devices are the\npop stars of the smartphone world, then the Mi A1 is the beloved folk indie\nthat everyone could get into.\n\nConjuring a successor hasn't been quite as easy. The Mi A2, while a solid\ndevice, saw the removal of the headphone jack and expandable storage, which\nloses the series' mass appeal (it's also priced a little higher). It's a good\nphone, just not quite the balanced act that made the Mi A1 so lovable.\n\nThe Mi A3 appears to be a course correction. The 3.5mm audio jack is back, and\nusers can expand its storage up to 256GB. Add in the newest camera tech and a\nlarger battery and the Mi A3 seems like it's very eager to please. With a\nprice starting from US$213.44 (RM899), the device may very well be a worthy\nsuccessor to the A1.\n\nYet all these great inclusions mean compromises, and for the Mi A3, these\ncompromises feel like it mars an otherwise great phone. The result is a phone\nthat leaves me wanting, even if I can honestly say that it's a solid device.\n\n**The compromised screen**\n\nLet's talk design first. The Mi A3 seems inspired by the design of the Mi 9.\nIt's smaller - about 0.3-inches smaller in screen estate - but it's almost\nfundamentally similar, down to the waterdrop notch.\n\nIt's not a bad thing. The overall look and feel of the Mi A3 is great and\npremium-like, and there's a nice balance between heft and sleekness when\nholding it in hand. The \"Not Just Blue\" version I have is the most striking of\nwhat the Mi A3 has to offer (\"More than White\" and \"Kind of Grey\" are other\noptions), and the more youthful in look of the three.\n\nGorilla Glass 5 covers both the front and back of the device, which is a nice\ntouch. But the best inclusion here is the under-screen fingerprint scanner.\nMuch like the one under the Mi 9T, it's responsive and fast, unlocking the\ndevice in an instant with pretty consistent accuracy, even with damp fingers.\nThe swirling lights that accompany the scanning process are strangely\nsatisfying.\n\nThe screen is a 6.088-inch AMOLED display at a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and is the\nmost contentious aspect of the Mi A3. See, this is a HD+ display, at 1560 x\n720 resolutions - a markedly lower one than even the Mi A1's.\n\nIt's not at all a terrible display - at a glance, it's certainly bright and\nthe colours look lively. I daresay that for games and movies, the display\nholds up well enough, even if it isn't a Full HD experience. But you will\nnotice jaggedness in the text and on solid-coloured backgrounds. This may be\nforgivable on a budget device under RM500, but for the third incarnation of\nthe Mi A-series of phones, it feels like a step back.\n\n**Sufficient power**\n\nIt's still a solid multimedia device. As mentioned, the screen has decent\nbrightness. The speakers are surprisingly loud, and the sound rich and deep.\n\nThe phone is also more than capable of handling day to day use. It's powered\nby the Snapdragon 665 chipset, which is a minor upgrade over the Mi A2's\nSnapdragon 660 chip. This is combined with 4GB of RAM, which may appear\ndisappointing, though I feel that it doesn't affect much of the phone's\nperformance.\n\nApps and multi-tasking runs fairly smooth and the phone works well for gaming.\nI got a generally solid experience playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\nMobile. All-in-all, it's a dependable performer that's more than capable of\nhandling the usual slate of smartphone tasks.\n\nIt's also highly dependable in the battery department. The Mi A3 carries a\n4,030mAh battery, which is about 35% larger than what is inside its two\npredecessors. It supports Quick Charge 3.0, so if you use a compatible 18W\ncharger, it will fill about 45% of a depleted battery in 30 minutes. 100\nminutes of charge gives you a fully-charged device.\n\nI usually manage to end the day with a good 30% to 40% of battery life left,\nand that's from a day's worth of social media browsing, some light gaming,\nsome videos and reading manga. Even on heavy usage, it should last you well\nuntil bedtime.\n\nBeing an Android One device, you won't find Xiaomi's MIUI here. This is a pure\nAndroid experience, and while the MIUI may have some nifty pre-installed apps,\npurists will be able to enjoy a clutter-free experience. It also receives\nregular security updates from Google, so as far as user experience goes, the\nMi A3 is fantastic.  \n\n**Solid shooters**\n\n\n\n![Review: Xiaomi\u2019s Mi A3 is a solid one, even if it leaves you\nwanting](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Xiomi%20Mi%20A3%20Triple%20camera.jpg)\n\n\n\nIt's heartening, at least, to see that the Mi A3 sporting some of the newer\ncamera tech. This device has a triple-camera setup on its back, though it's\nimportant to note that only two of them are active shooters.\n\n\n\n![Review: Xiaomi\u2019s Mi A3 is a solid one, even if it leaves you\nwanting](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Xiomi%20Mi%20A3%20wide%20angle.jpg)\n\n\n\nLike the Mi 9T, the Mi A3's main camera has a 48MP sensor that is combined\nwith an 8MP ultra-wide angle shooter. The third camera is a 2MP sensor for\ncapturing depth information when shooting in portrait mode. There isn't a\ntelephoto snapper here, mind, despite the 2X zoom shortcut on the camera app\n(it gives you a digitally zoomed image instead).  \n\nThe shooters perform just as well as you'd expect. The main camera, by\ndefault, provides 12MP images. They show good level of detail and true-to-life\ncolours, with solid contrast and appear sharp buy not over-sharpened.\n\nYou can, of course, opt to shoot in dedicated 48MP mode. I would say, however,\nthat the details here are nothing to shout about, and it ultimately takes up\nmore space to shoot in 48MP.\n\nAs for the ultra-wide angle camera, the images produced offer some good\ncolours as well. There is a noticeable fisheye-esque warped quality to it that\nisn't quite present in the Mi 9T and other wide-angle phones, but it's not so\nbad as to ruin the image.\n\n\n\n![Review: Xiaomi\u2019s Mi A3 is a solid one, even if it leaves you\nwanting](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Xiomi%20Mi%20A3%20nightshot1.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe shooters function decently in darker situations, too. Photos from the\nregular camera turned out fine, though you can certainly expect them to appear\nsofter. All in all, it's not too crummy, though Night Mode (which takes about\na second or two to shoot) does let you take more detailed shots at night, even\nif it doesn't work quite as nicely as the more premium phones out there.\n\nThe Mi A3 also sports a good selfie camera - a 32MP shooter that works well in\nbright situations. Xiaomi has also included that panorama selfie mode that I\nlike in the Mi 9T, which is a plus.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the Mi A3 is a solid Android One device that has the\nperformance, battery, features and cameras to ensure that you'll get your\nmoney's worth for the under RM1,000 price you pay. This means putting up with\na lower-resolution display, though it does make you feel more tempted to top\nup extra to get the Mi 9T instead.\n\nAnd that's the unfortunate position of the Mi A3 - a great budget device that\nleaves you wanting.\n\n\n\n###### Related Stories :\n\n  * [Xiaomi Mi A3 and Mi Band 4 arrive in Malaysia ](/personal-tech/xiaomi-mi-a3-and-mi-band-4-arrive-malaysia)\n  *

employment background checks has dipped 4% since 2016.\n\nClose to one in three or 32% of Singapore employees cover the truth with\nregards to their work history in their job applications, according to an\nemployment screening trends report by background check firm First Advantage.\n\nDiscrepancies in employee applications were found to be rife in Singapore,\nwith close to a third of all applications showing inconsistencies in 2018.\n\nEmployment discrepancies were followed by other checks such as CV verification\n(30%) and financial-related, comprising any negative financial records\nregarding incidents of bankruptcy, credit, financial regulatory and anti-money\nlaundering, discrepancies at 22%.\n\nAs a major financial hub, it is noteworthy that the highest screening priority\nin Singapore is financial-related checks, accounting for nearly 36% of all\nchecks in the country. Database checks or name checks referenced against\nvarious databases including those from media, address listings, passport\ntemplates and company registries followed suit, accounting for 21% of\nbackground checks in Singapore.\n\nThat said, First Advantage noted that the numbers of employment and financial-\nrelated checks have both declined in Singapore since 2016, by 4% and 14%,\nrespectively.\n\nDiscrepancies for educational checks to verify education and qualification\nrecords for an applicant from educational institutions that they state they\nhave attended made up 10% of all inconsistencies in the country.\n\nWhilst the number of education checks increased 2% since 2016, it still only\ncomprised of 9% of all background checks in Singapore. The same rate was found\nfor Singapore's regional counterpart, Hong Kong, which placed second as the\ncountry with the most inconsistencies amongst employment applications (26%).\n\nJapan and Malaysia remained the most stable countries in terms of candidate\nhonesty with differentials of only a few percentage points YoY. And South\nKorea, although showing a marginal 2% increase from 2017-2018, still boasted\nthe lowest discrepancy rate in the region of just 5%.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/SBR discrepancy apac chart.png)\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Person A is a competent worker who takes instructions\nwell and can be counted on to get the job done. Person B is less experienced\nand known to make careless mistakes, but not of a nature serious enough to get\nfired.\n\nBecause Person A is more dependable, the bulk of the work goes to him, leading\nhim to become stretched and frustrated. With less work assigned, Person B gets\nfree time to kick back and work at a leisurely pace.\n\nAfter amassing a sizeable portfolio, Person A throws in the towel and escapes\nto greener pastures. With little incentive to head anywhere, Person B stays\non.\n\nFast forward 10 years, would you like to make a wild guess who is the new\nmanager and what kind of people are left standing in the company?\n\nThis is probably the surest way for companies to slide into mediocrity. And it\nis happening all too often.\n\n## RELATIONSHIP OF CONVENIENCE\n\nMr Leong Chee Tung, chief executive officer of HR start-up EngageRocket, and\nformer managing consultant of Gallup, has seen many such cases across all\nindustries.\n\n[Singapore](/news/singapore)\n\n## [Help for freelancers and the self-employed in the\nworks](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/help-freelancers-self-employed-works)\n\nNov 16, 2017\n\n### Related Stories\n\n#### [Filipinos barred from leaving to work\noverseas](/news/singapore/filipinos-barred-leaving-work-overseas)\n\n#### [Flexi-work the way to go to making workers stay\nlonger](/news/singapore/flexi-work-way-go-making-workers-stay-longer)\n\n#### [Introverted? Prepare to be heard](/news/views/introverted-prepare-be-\nheard)\n\nHe said: \"In the civil service, the most talented staff writers get assigned\nmore papers to write; in sales teams, the most prolific salespeople get\nassigned the most leads; in engineering teams, the best engineers get assigned\nthe most requests and the list goes on.\"\n\nWhile managers do want to be fair to team members by ensuring fair\ndistribution of work, many just end up sticking to the tried and tested\napproach by giving the task - no matter how small - to the person with a good\ntrack record, he pointed out.\n\nMr Leong says that this tends to work great in the short term, as work gets\ndone faster and at a higher quality. But we all know that taking the easy way\nout often has consequences in the long run.\n\nHe said: \"There's a risk that if the distribution of rewards is not perceived\nas fair, these top producers could easily decide to take their talent\nelsewhere.\"\n\n## REWARDING RIGHT\n\nBut those who contribute the most get rewarded the most, managers often\nprotest. That makes sense theoretically, but some things are admittedly beyond\ntheir control, such as company performance.\n\nIf money is the main driving force, any perception of unfairness in the\ndistribution of rewards is a cause for concern. For example, a top performer\nmay add 10 times the value of his average peer, but most companies will not\npay the person 10 times more.\n\nBy using a bell curve model when it comes to performance appraisals, most\npeople will fall in the middle band by default. There is little incentive to\naim for the top if the rewards don't match the effort put in.\n\nAlso, not everyone is motivated by financial gain, said Mr Leong.\n\n## QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY\n\nTo be fair, most employees would understand if it is crunch time or if there\nare special circumstances that require them to pitch in much more than usual.\nBut if this persists throughout the year, regardless of the season, it is an\nindication of poor management.\n\nFor a start, Mr Leong suggests that managers take the time and effort to\nidentify the relative strengths of team members before assigning the work\naccordingly.\n\nHe gave an example of two salesmen. One may be extremely talented at building\nnew relationships quickly with many people and enjoys converting many leads in\na short period of time.\n\nThe other may be much better at building deep relationships with key\nstakeholders instead of working the circuit.\n\nA good sales manager would get the former to focus on quantity while deploying\nthe latter to pursue large key accounts with complex internal relationships,\nexplained Mr Leong.\n\n\"Both salesmen may ultimately perform equally well, and this would be\ndependent on the sales manager's ability to identify their individual talents\nand allocate work optimally.\"\n\nIt almost seems like a broken record to say that communication is critical for\nsuch a win-win situation to take place, but it is often the missing ingredient\nin manager-employee relationships.\n\nEmployees with grievances often think that managers can, or should, be able to\nread what is on their minds, and this is probably the start of a series of\nunfortunate misunderstandings.\n\nBut regardless, if your top people voice it out or not, the surest way to\ndrive them away is to give them the most work to do with no regard for their\nstrengths or interests, and take for granted the extra value they give.\n\nWhat these people need are quality stretch assignments to help them grow, so\ndon't bury their potential under an avalanche of menial work.\n\nRelationships of convenience never last long.\n\nThis article was published in The Business Times Weekend.\n\nGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the\n[Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-new-\npaper/id949361491?mt=8) or [Google Play\nStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sph.mypaperpdf&hl=en)\nnow\n\n[WORKERS](/tag/workers)[Employment](/tag/employment)[Singapore](/tag/singapore)\n\n  * [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.tnp.sg/news/views/unfair-workload-will-drive-top-workers-away&src=sdkpreparse \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.tnp.sg/news/views/unfair-workload-will-drive-top-workers-away&via=thenewpaper&hashtags=readOnTNP&text=Unfair workload will drive top workers away \"Share on Twitter\")\n  * [Share on WhatsApp](whatsapp://send?text=Unfair workload will drive top workers away -

* _**San Francisco Bay Area crowned best city for women entrepreneurs**_\n  * _**Lack of funding and gender pay gap inhibits Asian growth**_\n\n\n\n![DWEN 2019: Great time for women to be entrepreneurs, but there are still\ngaps to fill\n](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/DWEN%20Entrance.jpg)\n\n\n\nSUPPORT for women entrepreneurs is improving worldwide, but there is still a\nlot more to be done.\n\nThat's one takeaway from the 10th annual Dell Women Entrepreneur Network\nSummit (DWEN), held in Singapore from July 14 to 16. During the event, Dell\nTechnologies took time to announce the findings of the 2019 Women Entrepreneur\nCities (WE Cities) index, which ranks 50 global cities on their ability to\nfoster growth for women entrepreneurs.\n\nDone in partnership with global information provider IHS Markit, the Index\nresearched and ranked the cities on five characteristics, including access to:\nCapital, Technology, Talent, Culture and Markets.\n\nThe index notes that all 50 cities have made progress since the last WE Cities\nindex, which was in 2017. This year, the San Francisco Bay Area outranked New\nYork for the number one spot, largely due to how the Bay Area serves as one of\nthe best places for women to gain access to capital, the index notes.\n\nThe city also moved from sixth place to second place when it comes to Culture,\nwhich is indicative of the impact from the number of role models there as well\nas public dialogue around eliminating the \"bro culture\".\n\nFollowing New York, the other cities in the top 10 are London, Boston, Los\nAngeles, Washington DC, Seattle, Paris, Toronto and Stockholm.\n\nIHS Markit's consulting associate director Karen Campbell says that even\ncities in the bottom 10 still made great strides overall.\n\n\"This year we can see some patterns emerging. Ranked cities have collectively\nmade the most improvement in the Capital and Culture pillars, which shows the\nimportance of measuring not just the operating environment but also enabling\nenvironment for women entrepreneurs,\" she says.\n\nIt may be an upward trend, but as the index notes, even the No.1-ranked San\nFrancisco Bay Area scored only 63.7 out of a total of 100 possible points.\nEssentially, there is a lot of room for improvement even among the top-ranking\ncities.\n\n**The SEA condition**\n\nIt's important to note there are no Asian cities within the top 20 of the\nindex (Singapore is ranked 21st, and is the highest-ranked Asian city).\nSingapore has fallen tremendously from the list - the city state was ranked\n8th in the 2017 We Cities index.\n\nMalaysia didn't fare any better - this year, it ranks at 44th, having fallen\nfrom 41st in 2017.\n\n\n\n![DWEN 2019: Great time for women to be entrepreneurs, but there are still\ngaps to fill\n](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Amit%20Midha.jpg)\n\n\n\nIt's not to say that Asian cities are not improving. As Dell Technologies's\nAsia Pacific and Japan (APJ) president Amit Midha _**(pic, above)**_ notes,\nall cities in the index are improving - it's just that some are improving so\nfast, they displace those which were previously higher on the list, as in the\ncase of Singapore.\n\nThe study found that APAC has the lowest average improvement scores compared\nto other regions.\n\nMidha says that, in Asia, talent and access to technology is improving well.\nSingapore's Talent pillar in particular, benefitted from increasing its top\nschool rankings as well as its business school rankings, in addition to an\nincreased pool of professionals needed to help scale businesses.\n\nThe gaps in Asia, however, are primarily in access to funding and the gender\npay gap. \"There isn't enough money coming through the system. It isn't a\nsystematic issue, it is a fact-based issue - it's about money going to female\nfounders in these cities,\" he says.\n\nThe index notes that in Singapore, for instance, VC funding to female\nentrepreneurs is still relatively light compared to other cities.\nAdditionally, Singaporean women also saw less crowdfunding and there were\nfewer female founders.\n\n\"As more female founders get access to money, cities will continues to rise up\nin the list as well,\" Midha says.\n\n**Great innovations**\n\nThere is still significant room for improvement, but Midha nevertheless says\nthat it has \"never been a better time to be a female founder, and to be in the\ntechnology business.\n\n\"This is a great level playing field. Size is no longer the advantage. Speed\nand innovation is the advantage,\" he says.\n\nThere's also no ignoring Asia as a hotbed of technological innovation and\neconomic growth. \"This is just not necessarily a cheap place to manufacture,\nbut it's also a great innovation engine.\"\n\nEmerging technology is also impacting women entrepreneurs in this region. \"The\nbusiness case is super strong. With micro-financing, the write-offs are lower.\nThe success rate of companies with a more diverse founding team is\nsignificantly higher in Asia - 60% of the higher performing startups has a\nfemale as a founding or co-founding member,\" Midha says.\n\n\"When more women work, economies grow. Technology is helping to drive this\nprogress as a gender-neutral enabler, and helps create a level playing field.\nWhilst all cities in the Index have improved, the crucial factor is the\nconsistency of this improvement across the different factors that impact women\nentrepreneurs' success.\"\n\nHe adds that the biggest thing countries should think about to make long-term\nprogress is how to get more STEM education. But access to funding and capital\nshouldn't be forgotten either.\n\n\"Getting women to have access to funding, access to networks, are the core\ningredients to creating a better society. This is our [Dell's] moral\nresponsibility. This is our cause. And we're asking other companies and\ngovernments to join us in this cause,\" Midha says.\n\nDWEN will be Dell's contribution to this cause. The event sees over 150 female\nfounders, CEOs, dignitaries and Dell Technology leaders convening to connect\nand discuss pressing topics through keynotes, panels and workshops.\n\n\n\n![DWEN 2019: Great time for women to be entrepreneurs, but there are still\ngaps to fill\n](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/karen%20Quintos.jpg)\n\n\n\n\"When we invest in women, we invest in the future; communities prosper,\neconomies thrive and the next generation leads with purpose,\" says Dell\nTechnologies executive vice president and chief customer officer Karen Quintos\n_**(pic, above)**_.\n\n\"By arming city leaders and policymakers with actionable, data-driven research\non the landscape for women entrepreneurs, we can collectively accelerate the\nsuccess of women-owned businesses by removing financial, cultural and\npolitical barriers.\"\n\n_**Tan Jee Yee reports from the 10th annual Dell Women Entrepreneur Network\nSummit (DWEN) in Singapore, at the invitation of Dell Technology.

prepaid solution in Razer Pay e-wallet**_\n  * _**Users can make payments at 54 million merchant locations on Visa 's network**_\n\n\n\n![\\(From left\\) Razer chief strategy officer Limeng Lee; Razer co-founder and\nCEO Min-Liang Tan; Visa Asia Pacific regional president Chris Clark; and Visa\nhead of Asia Pacific Solutions Cietan\nKitney](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Razer%20and%20Visa%20executives.jpg)\n\nRAZER, a global lifestyle brand for gamers, and Visa, a leader in digital\npayments, have announced a first of its kind partnership that will transform\npayments in the gaming industry by bringing the scale and reach of Visa's\nglobal network to Razer Pay e-wallet users.  \n\nThe partnership will see Razer's financial technology arm, Razer Fintech, join\nVisa's fintech fast-track programme, which is designed to make it easier for\nfintechs to access the global Visa payments network.\n\nHere, Razer Fintech and Visa will develop a virtual Visa prepaid solution to\nbe embedded in the Razer Pay e-wallet, that will allow up to 60 million Razer\nusers to make payments wherever Visa is accepted at 54 million merchant\nlocations worldwide.\n\nVisa Asia Pacific regional president Chris Clark, said: \"We are pleased to\npartner with such a forward-looking and innovative company that understands\nthe value and importance of expanding access to digital payments. This\nannouncement reaffirms Visa's commitment to the fast-growing and digitally\nsavvy Southeast Asia region.\n\n\"Together, Visa and Razer Fintech have the opportunity to transform the\npayments experience for not only the gaming community but many of Southeast\nAsia's unbanked and underserved consumers as well.\"\n\nRazer co-founder and chief executive officer Min-Liang Tan, said: \"Razer\nFintech is a core growth initiative for Razer as we continue to empower\ndigital payments across emerging markets, starting from Southeast Asia.\n\n\"We are incredibly excited with the opportunities that this innovative payment\nsolution serves to millions of consumers, connecting them to an extensive\nnetwork of merchants globally. This partnership with Visa significantly\nextends Razer Fintech's position as the largest offline-to-online digital\npayment network in the region.\"\n\n**Integration of Visa prepaid solution into Razer Pay**\n\nRazer Fintech and Visa look to roll out an exclusive Razer-branded Visa\nprepaid payment solution integrated into Razer Pay via a mini-app.\n\nBy leveraging on Visa's global network, Razer Pay users will be able to make\npayments wherever Visa is accepted.\n\nThe prepaid solution will complement Razer Pay's existing offerings, which\ninclude everyday essentials such as mobile top-ups, leading virtual credits,\nand entertainment purchases for music and streaming services. Users will also\nenjoy a slew of exciting benefits and rewards when using their prepaid cards\nfor ecommerce transactions and when they make purchases overseas.  \n\nThe integrated prepaid card solution will offer users the same convenient top-\nup and cash-out methods available on Razer Pay, underpinned by an advanced\nprivacy and security framework.\n\nRazer Pay has collaborated with partners to amplify its existing offerings by\nintroducing ride-hailing, movie ticketing, and utility payments in streamlined\nmini-applications.\n\n**Bringing financial inclusion**\n\nSoutheast Asia has a large unbanked and underserved population of over 438\nmillion .
