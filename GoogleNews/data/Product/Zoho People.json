It\u2019s a powerful option, offering\nsecure, ad-free email hosting. Additionally, it comes with a great free\nversion and selection of extra management tools. In this Zoho Mail review,\nwe\u2019ve explored every aspect of this excellent email provider, and present you\nwith everything you need to know to help you make a buying decision.\nUltimately, Zoho Mail targets business users of all sizes, and it offers\nimpressive value for money.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Plans and pricing\n\nSmall businesses and individual users can take advantage of Zoho Mail\u2019s free\nforever plan. It can be used by up to five people with 5GB of storage per user\nand a 25MB attachment limit. However, it\u2019s limited to web access and can only\nbe used with a single domain.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nZoho Mail offers great value for money. (Image credit: Zoho)\n\nThose with more advanced requirements can upgrade to a paid plan. The Mail\nLite plan costs just $1 per user per month and includes multiple domain\nhosting, among a suite of other tools. A Mail Premium subscription costs $4\nper month per user and comes with a selection of more powerful features such\nas email backup and significantly larger attachments. Finally, those who plan\non using multiple Zoho apps will benefit from great discounts with a Workplace\nsubscription (starts from $3 per user per month).\n\nA 15-day free trial is also available with the Mail Premium plan, enabling you\nto test it before committing for any length of time.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Features\n\nThose who use Zoho Mail will benefit from a range of powerful features. As a\nleading professional email provider, it naturally comes with the expected\nemail management tools, including spam filters, mobile apps, and mail filters.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nZoho Mail offers so much more than simple email management. (Image credit:\nZoho)\n\nHowever, it enables users to do so much more than just check their emails. For\nexample, the Zoho Mail interface includes a calendar, notes, task manager, and\ncontact portal. A range of collaboration tools are also available to help your\nteam work more efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, Zoho Mail\u2019s more advanced features will enable you to control\nand manage mailbox access for specific team members. For example, you could\nallow your sales team members to only access your sales@yourdomain mailbox and\nset permissions controlling the actions they\u2019re able to take.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Setup\n\nSetting up a new business email account with Zoho Mail will take some time,\nbut the process is straightforward and well- documented. For starters, you\nneed to sign up for a new account with your domain name (if you have one) and\nsome personal details.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nGetting started with Zoho Mail is very straightforward. (Image credit: Zoho)\n\nFollowing this, you will need to verify your domain by logging into your DNS\nmanager and following the prompts. Each DNS manager includes a slightly\ndifferent verification process, and Zoho outlines the required steps in a very\nclear, easy-to-follow manner. Once you\u2019re verified, you can add users, create\ngroups, and begin customizing your email client. The entire setup process took\nus around an hour.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Performance\n\nIn our experience, Zoho Mail is one of the most reliable email services\navailable. It performs very well, with a responsive, streamlined user\ninterface. Mail can be easily tagged and sorted using custom filters, enabling\ndifferent team members to access the messages that are relevant to them. Users\ncan also create detailed spam filters to reduce the number of irrelevant\nmessages reaching their inbox.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nZoho Mail comes with a fast, responsive user interface and great performance.\n(Image credit: Zoho)\n\nZoho Mail\u2019s collaboration features also work great. If necessary, you can tag\nteam members in specific emails, leave a note for someone else, or share\nemails with pre-defined groups. It\u2019s easy to set up reminders with the built-\nin calendar, and you can also bookmark important emails that you will need to\naccess later.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Security\n\nA powerful selection of security features is used to ensure your Zoho Mail\naccount is protected. For starters, highly secured data centers backed by\nphysical security and DDOS protection are used by all Zoho services. A\nselection of data protection tools is also available, including DMARC, malware\ndetection, and advanced spam filtering.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nZoho Mail is supported by a suite of powerful security features. (Image\ncredit: Zoho)\n\nAdditionally, Zoho Mail includes encrypted email security at all times. All\ndata is encrypted, both when at rest and when in transit. This reduces the\nrisk of unauthorized access. Similarly, user accounts are highly secured with\naccess protection tools such as two-factor authentication and OAuth 2.0\nsupport.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Support\n\nPaid subscribers can access Zoho Mail\u2019s 24/7 phone support in 11 countries\nacross the world. Those with a free plan or living in an unsupported country\ncan submit an online ticket or send an email to the support team.\n\n![Zoho Mail review](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nZoho Mail comes with extensive documentation. (Image credit: Zoho)\n\nMeanwhile, Zoho Mail comes with a help center containing detailed\ndocumentation and numerous how-to guides. Video tutorials are also available,\nand the FAQ page contains answers to more basic questions.\n\n## Zoho Mail: Final verdict\n\nOverall, Zoho Mail is a great professional email provider with advanced\nfeatures and a user-friendly interface. A resource-rich free forever plan is\navailable, and the paid plans are very competitively priced. Setting up a Zoho\nMail account is simple, and the email client itself performs very well. All\nthings considered, this program is well suited to all user types, from\nindividuals to large businesses.\n\n## The competition\n\nZoho Mail is one of the best email hosting services available, but there are\nsome competitors that should be considered. For example, [Microsoft Office\n365](https://www.techradar.com/sg/reviews/pc-mac/software/home-and-reference-\nsoftware/microsoft-office-365-980626/review) includes OneDrive storage, large\nattachments, and a selection of advanced tools. Prices start at $5 per month,\nbut you will also gain access to other Microsoft programs.\n\nNot what you\u2019re looking for from an email provider?

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/zoho-\nmakes-enterprise-apps-free-coronavirus-impacted-smbs/) __\n\n[Zoho](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/mastercard-zoho-small-\nbusiness-digital-payments/), which provides business-related apps for customer\nservice, marketing and more, is letting companies use its products for free\nduring the [coronavirus](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/coronavirus/) pandemic,\naccording to a [press release](https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/03/zoho-small-\nbusiness-emergency-subscription-assistance-program.html).\n\nThe company has launched the Small Business Emergency Subscription Assistance\nProgram (ESAP), which will help primarily the 20,000 Zoho clients that are\nsmall- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with 25 employees or less. Those\ncompanies will be able to use Zoho's apps for free for three months.\n\nZoho's tools include assistance with customer service applications, marketing,\ncollaboration and production tools, back-office work and accounting \u2014 all of\nwhich will be available for free.\n\nThis is compounded on Zoho's other recent announcement of the Remotely\nsoftware, which aids in the transition to helping people work from home. That\nsoftware was introduced last month after the company had to cancel its\nZoholics summit.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus, working from home has become the default for many\nbusinesses trying to avoid forcing people to spend time around others for too\nlong for fears of spreading the highly contagious virus.\n\nZoho, as such, has seen over 5,000 new clients for its Remotely software since\nrolling it out a few weeks ago.\n\nZoho Co-Founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu said the move to make the services free\ncame from the stress and hurt most businesses are under as a result of the\nglobal pandemic. He said it was \"even worse\" because no one knew when things\nwould be back to normal, so anything Zoho or other companies could do to\nalleviate the difficulties was of paramount importance.\n\nOne Zoho customer, [Violet Press](https://www.violetpressandpaper.com/retail-\nhome), has benefited from the help, according to the company\u2019s founder and\ndesigner, Violet Warner. She said every part of Violet Press has been affected\nby the virus, so the company was gracious of Zoho to extend free rent to them\nfor a few months.\n\nAs the virus takes its toll on the world, SMBs have had to close due to\nrestrictions from government attempts to stave off the spread, so people have\nhad to band together to find other ways to support [smaller\nbusinesses](https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/collaborative-help-main-\nstreet-database-will-aid-small-businesses/).\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

I have been remiss in writing this up, but honestly,\nCOVID19 and a few other things got in the way of knocking it out.\n\nRather than give my readers a specific take on what I saw there, I want to\nassume that you\u2019ve never heard of the company in spite of its success.  \n\nAs an industry, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that a good quality customer\nexperience (CX) results in a stickier and more monetizable customer base.\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) platforms are critical tools in\nbridging the gap between a customer and a company\u2019s relationship to make for\nexcellent customer experience. Zoho is one of the lesser-known enterprise-\nlevel SaaS companies and arguably the most successful business software as a\nservice (SaaS) company you have never heard of. Let\u2019s make that case and look\nat what Zoho is doing to make such a statement.\n\n**About Zoho**\n\nZoho is a business software solutions company with over 20 years of experience\nin business software development. Zoho began with its Zoho CRM platform in\n2005 and has expanded to all different departments of business and enterprise.\nZoho also offers an enterprise-level subscription called Zoho1. Zoho One has\nall 40+ of Zoho\u2019s apps bundled together to make for a connected \u201coperating\nsystem for business.\u201d Zoho has over 50 million users in over 180 countries\nglobally.\n\n**How they do it**\n\nToday In: [Cloud](https://www.forbes.com/cloud)\n\n  * [\n\n### A Review: Six Months With The Samsung Galaxy Fold\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/04/07/a-review-six-months-\nwith-the-samsung-galaxy-fold/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How Technology Kept Me Sane During My Fight With COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/04/07/how-technology-kept-me-\nsane-during-my-fight-with-covid-19/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Putting HPC To Work To Accelerate COVID-19 Research\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/04/07/putting-hpc-to-work-to-\naccelerate-covid-19-research/)\n\nThe bread and butter of Zoho\u2019s operating system as a business is its CRM\nplatform. When people think of a sale, they think of the Point of sale (POS).\nThe POS is where the sale takes place but that is not where it starts nor\nwhere it is finalized. A sale typically starts with a lead and some\nadvertisements and _leads_ to the point of sale and in many cases multiple\nPOSs.\n\nThe difficult problem of CX platforms is making it usable and adaptable across\ndiverse use cases. Adoption depends on a company\u2019s use case and Zoho wants to\nlower the barrier of technology adoption. Zoho One is scalable in its apps and\nservices and needs to be personable based on the relationship between the\ncustomer and company\u2019s relationship. Companies can start with Zoho\u2019s CRM and\nimplement its other apps and services over time. In the process of adopting\nZoho\u2019s platform, Zoho\u2019s apps can be integrated with other apps like Gsuite.\n\nThe sale and customer interaction in the sale are evolving. More and more\ncustomers are interacting with the pre-sale, sale, and post-sale so that\ncustomer experience is more than just the CRM and more than just customer\nservice. All interactions of the sale need to be scalable. Zoho\u2019s solution is\nto make its software, specifically Zoho One, personable vertically as well as\nhorizontally.\n\n![Zoho\u2019s app development began with its CRM platform and the number of apps as\nincreased years to over 40 business apps.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e824d92cff6b00007a459d8/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nZoho's app development began with its CRM platform and the number of apps as\nincreased years to over ... [+] 40 business apps.\n\nZoho\n\nWhen all its software is connected across all departments, it becomes a\nunified experience. This unified experience is Zoho One\u2019s horizontal solution-\ncreate a connected platform that is scalable. Companies that are connected\nacross all departments of business tend to get things done faster and more\nefficiently. Collaboration happens proactively as information is shared from\napp to app across different departments. Zoho\u2019s proactive approach to its CX\nplatform trumps a reactive approach every time.\n\nZoho\u2019s vertical integration connects its apps with its services and its\nservices with its platform infrastructure to minimize personalization\nbarriers. The CX platform is no longer a surface-level experience. Zoho has\n45+ apps connected to Zoho\u2019s AI, Search, Analytics, single sign-on (SSO),\nMessaging, and other services. When this happens, apps are personalized from\ncontextual data from the customer. Sales can more rapidly identify signals and\nintelligently orchestrate the process of a sale. A personalization layer\nunifies Zoho\u2019s services with its apps. All of Zoho\u2019s apps and services are\noptimized on Zoho\u2019s Network and database. Zoho\u2019s acceleration Network (ZAN) is\noptimized to reduce latency for its customers. ZAN has 9 sites on the edge and\ngrowing globally. None of Zoho\u2019s global cloud platform is public. Optimization\nis there for Zoho\u2019s infrastructure and growth.\n\n**Personalization and implementation in AI and ML**\n\nOne of the many ways Zoho unifies and connects its CX platform horizontally\nand vertically is by implementing AI and machine learning into its software.\nZoho\u2019s AI has breadth and depth. Zoho\u2019s AI has breadth in that it is\nimplemented across apps to get contextualized data where it needs to go\nintelligently. Zia is Zoho\u2019s intelligent assistant for Zoho\u2019s operating system\nfor business. Zia gives insights and contextualizes data to share and connect\nall departments. Zoho AI has depth in that it optimizes all levels of the CX\nplatform. Services and apps have a rich implementation of AI and machine\nlearning that comes from years of R&D at Zoho. AI and ML at Zoho started with\nits sales and marketing platforms and has expanded and continues to expand in\nAI tools across all departments of Zoho\u2019s CX platform. ****\n\n![Zia, Zoho\u2019s intelligent assistant, can be used to record client\ncalls](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e824dc0adc0d70006ccecd8/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nZia, Zoho's intelligent assistant, can be used to record client calls\n\nZoho\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe difference between Zoho and other CRM platforms like Salesforce, Sugar,\nand Highrise is that Zoho\u2019s focus is on an operating system for business.\nSalesforces is a larger company and has over 2,600+ apps as well as its own\nbusiness suite. Sugar CRM focuses on cloud innovations and information\nmanagement. Highrise focuses on the relationship with the customer and the\nuser. Zoho focuses on implementing all these features to create an all-in-one\noperating system for business.\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nThe difficulty of implementing software into an enterprise is connecting all\nthe data without compromising a customer\u2019s personal experience. Zoho\u2019s success\nis its focus on scalability by unifying its CX platform horizontally and\nvertically means that more companies can be personal with their customers.\nZoho has a plan for minimizing the adoption barrier of its operating system\nfor business.\n\nI will be attending Zoho\u2019s Zoholics virtual customer event soon and hope to\nsee you there digitally!\n\n  \n\n_Note: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to\nthis article._\n\n_Disclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms,\nprovides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to\nmany high-tech companies in the industry, including Amazon.com, Advanced Micro\nDevices, Apstra, ARM Holdings, Aruba Networks, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\nBitfusion, Cisco Systems, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo\nTechnologies, Digital Optics, Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Foxconn, Frame,\nFujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google, HP Inc.,\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Intel, Interdigital,\nJabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux\nFoundation, MACOM (Applied Micro), MapBox, Mavenir, Mesosphere, Microsoft,\nNational Instruments, NetApp, NOKIA, Nortek, NVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG,\nOpenStack Foundation, Panasas, Peraso, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Portworx,\nPure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus, Rayvolt E-Bikes, Red Hat, Samsung\nElectronics, Silver Peak, SONY, Springpath, Sprint, Stratus Technologies,\nSymantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, TensTorrent, Tobii Technology, Twitter, Unity\nTechnologies, Verizon Communications, Vidyo, Wave Computing, Wellsmith,\nXilinx, Zebra, ZOHO which may be cited in this article._\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/patrickmoorhead) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patmoorhead).

He said at\nminimum, more work is required to keep both separate to avoid breaches, but it\nonly gets worse from there, he added.\n\n\"Marketing has never been a crime. Companies have marketed to their customers\nsince God knows when, time immemorial, so what you have is -- how you use the\nmarketing, how you use the tools,\" he said.\n\n\"What of those tools are made visible to your customers? How do people know\nhow they're being observed, watched, or how their data is being used? ...\nThat's where the moral part comes in.\n\n\"It's the analogy of \u2026 is a crime attributed to the gun or the gun holder?\nMarketing is a tool \u2026 what are your ethics and morals or governance is the\nbigger question.\"\n\nAnother decision taken by the Indian productivity giant is that it has banned\nthird-party cookies.\n\n\"Third-party cookies are an evil of the internet age that people are simply\nnot aware of,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of 'value in collecting this data,' because there's a\npresumption ... that customer data is up and available for sale, despite all\nthe regulatory regimes that are trying to clamp down on it.\"\n\nBy banning third-party cookies, Sundaram said Zoho has been able to make the\nstatement to its customers that their data is their data.\n\n\"Our customers may choose to use our products and put in third-party cookies\n-- we don't have a right on that, and we can't mandate that,\" he added.\n\n\"From our point of view, every company should just do this. In fact, they\nshould do this because it's a matter of principle. And most companies will\nonly do it when they're mandated by the law.\"\n\nZoho, which offers a suite of enterprise applications that add up to be a\nbusiness operating system, currently boasts a user base of over 50 million.\n\n### RELATED COVERAGE\n\n  * [Apple blocks third-party cookies in Safari](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-blocks-third-party-cookies-in-safari/)\n  * [Cookie consent: Most websites break law by making it hard to 'reject all' tracking](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cookie-consent-most-websites-break-law-by-making-it-hard-to-reject-all-tracking/)\n  * [Data protection: Top 3 business challenges](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-protection-top-3-business-challenges/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b) (TechRepublic)\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ India ](/topic/india/) [ Security TV ](/topic/security-tv/) [ Data\nManagement ](/topic/data-management/) [ CXO ](/topic/cxo/) [ Data Centers\n](/topic/data-centers/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Asha\nBarbaschow](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/08/25/61facbce-5758-4e97-970a-63e62bcb6624/thumbnail/40x40/5f24407ce79ab3c3942cb5ff3b708d45/headshot-\nasha-mclean-for-zd.jpg) ](/meet-the-team/au/asha-barbaschow/)\n\nBy [ Asha Barbaschow ](/meet-the-team/au/asha-barbaschow/) | April 1, 2020 --\n02:20 GMT (10:20 GMT+08:00) | Topic: [Security](/topic/security/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\n##  More from Asha Barbaschow\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/26/46701227-8a3d-4a17-9d62-ed93d976da95/thumbnail/170x128/a71ccbacabe49292adde2e93951a2bb9/istock-1051616796.jpg)](/article/nearly-23-million-aussies-have-a-my-health-record-but-only-13-million-are-using-it/ \"Nearly 23 million Aussies have a My Health Record, but only 13 million are using it\")\n\nInnovation\n\n[Nearly 23 million Aussies have a My Health Record, but only 13 million are\nusing it](/article/nearly-23-million-aussies-have-a-my-health-record-but-\nonly-13-million-are-using-it/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/04/20/9c488db9-2e1a-40cf-8d40-99fa82c614e0/thumbnail/170x128/f5b1192f7310267d282967274ca31452/various-medicine-capsules.jpg)](/article/electronic-prescriptions-in-australia-to-be-available-at-end-of-may/ \"Electronic prescriptions in Australia to be available at end of May\")\n\nInnovation\n\n[Electronic prescriptions in Australia to be available at end of\nMay](/article/electronic-prescriptions-in-australia-to-be-available-at-end-of-\nmay/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/06/f5b9f560-7814-4367-9256-8debb106c2ff/thumbnail/170x128/c841b8db6884e11602451d96c68e1c2a/istock-1145361636.jpg)](/article/12-years-on-wa-audit-finds-government-entities-still-dont-get-infosec/ \"12 years on, audit finds WA government entities still don't get infosec\")\n\nSecurity\n\n[12 years on, audit finds WA government entities still don't get\ninfosec](/article/12-years-on-wa-audit-finds-government-entities-still-dont-\nget-infosec/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/03/19/e8337154-dac7-4774-a53f-d509fc457f5d/thumbnail/170x128/8c8711aa2f8b5df348151c87dd1a6932/istock-1211338483.jpg)](/article/intel-pledges-50m-to-help-fight-covid-19/ \"Intel pledges $50m to help fight COVID-19\")\n\nTech Industry\n\n[Intel pledges $50m to help fight COVID-19](/article/intel-pledges-50m-to-\nhelp-fight-covid-19/)\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

Some\npeople use the word \"margin\" because it's at the margin that things change. A\nsituation or condition exists more or less in equilibrium with the rest of its\nenvironment until in one way or another the stresses of the situation become\nso great that change happens.\n\nWe have lots of metaphors, like \"tipping point,\" \"the straw that broke the\ncamel's back,\" and many others that describe such situations.\n\nRight now, we live in one or more edge conditions -- personal, business and\neconomic -- and much blurring. Certainly, the pressures of trying to contain\nthe coronavirus are stressing all of us, and in a broader sense I wonder if\ncapitalism is in an edge condition.\n\nCertainly, many younger people seem to have embraced political messages that\nat least question capitalism's viability because of its fixation on growth.\nHow we respond as a civilization will have much impact on how people view our\ndominant economic model.\n\n##  Kindler, Gentler Capitalism\n\nI am not one of those alarmists who arrive on the scene pointing out the one\nthing, or small handful of things, that will need to change overnight. I\nrecently wrote that the most logical consequences will be the most affordable\nones.\n\nSo, for instance, don't look for massive changes in our transportation\ninfrastructure or office layouts; those cost fortunes to change. At the same\ntime, watch for improvements in virus screening and vaccine development to\nprevent a reprise of the pandemic we are living through.\n\nIn line with this, perhaps a kinder and gentler form of capitalism is in the\noffing. Companies are beginning to circle back to their customers to offer\nproducts to help customers weather the viral storm, either free or at greatly\nreduced prices. My interest at the moment is watching how Zoho, a CRM\nsupplier, is dealing with the crisis.\n\n##  Easing the Transition\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Zoho launched\n[Remotely](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/), a virtual productivity platform\ncomprising 11 collaboration applications. It is providing the solution to all\nsize businesses for free. It's doing that to help ease the transition to\nremote work for companies in any location around the world.\n\nIn just two weeks, more than 5,000 new companies are running on the platform,\nand that number is increasing every day. For instance, Zoho is witnessing 500\npercent growth in use of its collaboration apps and 1,000 percent growth in\ndaily new users of Zoho Meeting.\n\nToday, Zoho went further when CEO Sridhar Vembu announced the small business\nEmergency Subscription Assistance Program (ESAP) to assist Zoho's small\nbusiness customers. Like Remotely, it's free for a limited time.\n\nIn discussions with Zoho executives, I was surprised the first time one of\nthem told me that the company didn't care if it left money on the table and\nthat the most important thing it could do was to make a happy customer. That's\nin line with a famous maxim from the late business guru Peter Drucker: \"The\npurpose of business is to create and keep a customer.\" I suppose happy goes\nwithout saying.\n\n##  Salvation and Loyalty\n\nNow as a practical matter, it's doubtful that all 50 million Zoho customers\nwill line up for the free service. There will be enough paying businesses to\nsupport keeping the lights on and the disk drives spinning for the cloud\nsoftware provider. So Zoho might not lose money on this, though it certainly\nwill forgo revenue -- but in the service of keeping its global business\ncustomers afloat. It's a noble endeavor, and that's precisely what's most\ninteresting.\n\nIn times of crisis, often the official channels become clogged and quit\nworking. That's when the small and indirect channels can spring into action\nand make a substantial difference.\n\nGovernments around the world are trying to formulate rescue packages for their\nwhole economies to help them weather the storm. These are big picture things,\nthough, and they'll likely miss the detailed needs of companies, such as\npaying for subscription services.\n\nSo good on Zoho for thinking of this and for reaching out. The company is\nleaving money on the table intentionally, because it knows that a dead\ncustomer pays nothing and a saved customer might end up being extremely loyal.\n![](//www.ectnews.com/images/end-enn.gif)\n\n_The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of ECT News Network._\n\n* * *\n\n![](/images/rws737971/Denis Pombriant.jpg) **Denis Pombriant** is a well-known\nCRM industry analyst, strategist, writer and speaker.

**Sridhar Vembu** is one of the few individuals who doesn't need to answer to\nbanks or VCs about debt or increasing shareholder wealth.\n\n  \n\nThe Founder and CEO of privately held **Zoho Corp** , a maker of cloud-based\nbusiness software, recently announced **a donation of Rs 25 crore to the PM-\nCARES Fund**.\n\n  \n\nAnd characteristically, he spoke about why this was possible for a non-funded\ncompany.\n\n  \n\n> \"This **donation was possible because of the capital built by our employees\n> and the patronage of our customers** ,\" Sridhar said.\n\n![Sridhar

legal implications of layoffs or salary cuts during\ncoronavirus lockdown?\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/04/legal-implications-layoffs-salary-cuts-\ncoronavirus)\n\n* * *\n\n##  **Thinking beyond the pandemic**\n\nHe took to Twitter to speak about why **financial metrics had not prepared the\nworld to handle any crisis**.\n\n  \n\n\"Thanks to very bad monetary policy for a decade or more, **we had an era of\n'overvaluation of every asset class'**. That was why I ignored metrics like\nfinancial net worth. Let's think this through some more. Massive overvaluation\nof some asset implies undervaluation of something else 'relativity of\nvaluation' as I call it. But seemingly 'every asset class' was overvalued. So\nwhat gives? **What was massively devalued were things like governance and\nsocial solidarity**. Financial wealth deluded people into thinking that\n**everything can be bought in times of need**. We **cannot buy social capital\nor solidarity or governance**. But the shocking phenomenon that emerged was\n**even masks and ventilators could not be bought with money in desperate\ntimes** ,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n  \n\nHe went on to laud all governments in India, central and state, the police,\nthe health workers, and the civil servants for serving citizens very well.\n\n  \n\n> \"As an Indian citizen, I am **deeply grateful to the Indian State for its\n> governance and rising to this challenge**. Longer term, I am more determined\n> than ever to **focus on building deep capabilities and capacity in the\n> private sector** , focus on skills and know-how, **so we have economic\n> resilience**. We cannot predict adversity but we can withstand it,\" Sridhar\n> said.\n\n  \n\nRecently, [**Zoho Corp took Freshworks founders to court**\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/03/zoho-freshworks-court-unicorn-saas-cloud)over\nallegations of using confidential information from Zoho to gain market access\nand raise VC money to scale up the company. Freshworks is preparing its\ndefence against Zoho's allegations.\n\n  \n\n**_(Edited by Teja Lele Desai)_**\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

court. **A complaint has been\nfiled at the United States District Court, Northern District of California. **\n\n  \n\n**_YourStory_** has obtained a copy of the complaint.\n\n  \n\nThe plaintiff, Zoho Corp, has alleged that Freshworks founders \"have worked\nZoho for nine years prior to their founding of Freshworks, Messrs\nMathrubootham and Krishnasamy were privy to confidential Zoho product,\nfinancial, pricing, and customer information and were well aware of Zoho\nemployees' creation of and access to Zoho competitive business information.\n**After leaving to start Freshworks, Mr Mathrubootham improperly included Zoho\nconfidential revenue figures in early Freshworks investor pitch materials to\nsecure initial investments, leveraging his work at Zoho and suggesting his new\nstart-up would perform like Zoho**.\"\n\n  \n\n![Sridhar Vembu_Zoho\nCorp](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2016/04/Sridhar-Vembu_Zoho-\nCorp.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nSridhar

information and belief, Messrs Mathrubootham and Krishnasamy further used\nZoho know-how, product development, and market data to start Freshworks. While\nat Zoho, Mr Mathrubootham was Vice President of Product Management for\nManageEngine, Zoho's IT Management software. In that role, he was head of\ncustomer support for ManageEngine, which offered him specialised and non-\npublic knowledge of what Zoho (and thus other similar mid-size companies)\nwould need in a tool to provide efficient and effective support to its\ncustomers,\" Zoho alleges.\n\n  \n\nIn the complaint, Zoho mentions that \"it requires its employees to execute\nnon-disclosure agreements promising to keep any Zoho trade secrets,\nconfidential business information, technical information and non-public know-\nhow (including information regarding company finances, employees,\ncompensation, research and development, manufacturing and marketing) in\nconfidence and not to disclose such information outside of Zoho both during\nand after their employment. Employee confidentiality obligations extend to all\nconfidential business information, including technical information, product\ndevelopment roadmaps, marketing plans, and customer lists and potential leads\ntracked in Zoho's databases.\"\n\n  \n\n>  **Both Sridhar Vembu, Co-founder of Zoho, and Girish Mathrubootham, Co-\n> founder of Freshworks, stay in the Bay Area, San Francisco. Over 6,000\n> people work for Zoho and the company supplies food to all its employees in\n> Chennai from its own farms in Tenkasi, Tamil Nadu. Girish, on the other\n> hand, has close to 20 years of experience in in cloud computing. They have\n> been known to openly challenge the likes of Zendesk and Salesforce.**\n\nIn an email sent to Your Story, Girish Mathrubootham, the co-founder of\nFreshworks, says:\n\n  \n\n> \"Freshworks is taking these allegations seriously. We plan on defending the\n> case vigorously. I am working with our General Counsel to hire legal counsel\n> to defend against these allegations.\"\n\nZoho continues to allege,\n\n  \n\n\" **Freshworks has continued the practice of misappropriating Zoho 's\nconfidential and competitive business information to compete with Zoho**.\nKnowing Zoho employees have unique knowledge of the market landscape,\ncompetitive pricing, and Zoho's development paths for its business tools,\nFreshworks has recruited over a hundred employees from Zoho to gain access to\nsuch confidential Zoho information.\"\n\n  \n\nThe plaintiff adds,\n\n  \n\n\"On information and belief, Freshworks has also been improperly accessing\nZoho's customer data. As recently as February 24, 2020, Freshworks has been\nsystematically contacting Zoho's customers using Zoho confidential\ninformation. In some of these instances, Freshworks contacted Zoho's customers\nat email addresses the customers created solely for registration with Zoho's\ncloud-based offerings. The only way Freshworks would have knowledge of the\nemail addresses it used to contact Zoho's customers is through unauthorized\ndirect access of Zoho's confidential CRM database, which houses Zoho's\nconfidential customer lists and leads, as well as confidential and competitive\npricing and customer requirements data.\"\n\n  \n\n **Both founders refrained from commenting as the matter was now in court.**\n\n  \n\nZoho (Adventnet at the time) was founded by Sridhar Vembu in 1996 and built\nthe SaaS business in to a bootstrapped unicorn.\n\n  \n\n> Girish founded Freshworks, which provides organisations with SaaS customer\n> engagement solution, Freshdesk, in 2010 and had raised Series A funding from\n> Accel. The company has now raised close to $399 million and is valued at\n> $3.5 billion. Girish Mathrubootham had stated at _SaaS Bhoomi_ , the annual\n> conference for SaaS businesses, recently that Freshworks expected to close\n> the FY at $250 million. It has 35,000 paying customers and close to 250,000\n> customers. On the other hand, Zoho does not disclose revenues and boasts an\n> equal number of customers.\n\n![Girish](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/6b393640-140e-11e9-87e2-f7248b252f46/Girish-\nMathubhutam_YourStory1558449158102.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nGirish Mathrubootham, co-founder of Freshworks\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/3fb20ae02dc911e9af58c17e6cc3d915/Imagevkuw-1582794441370.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### SaaS startup Freshworks acquires AnsweriQ; Pradeep Rathinam to join senior\nexec team\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/02/saas-startup-freshworks-acquisition-answeriq)\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nSources say that this was to come to a head at some point of time because both\ncompanies were launching multiple platforms for SMBs and were moving forward\nthem. Industry sources add that this was not good for the Indian SaaS industry\nas both companies had their own niche and have a large base to capture.\n\n  \n\n\"Both founders have the same work ethic.

Necessity is the mother of\ninvention. You\u2019ve heard this and it\u2019s true. Even in the world of CRM.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic rages on many CRM companies - both large and small\n- are stepping up to provide tools that will help customers in different\nindustries better and more quickly engage with their customers and community.\nHere are just a few examples.\n\nCRM giant [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/\n\"http://www.salesforce.com/\"), for example, [is\nproviding](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2020/03/covid-19-care-response-\nsolution-healthcare.html\n\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2020/03/covid-19-care-response-solution-\nhealthcare.html\") what it calls a COVID-19 Response package that's targeted at\nemergency response teams, call centers, and care management teams for health\nsystems affected by coronavirus. The company is providing, for free, its\nHealth Cloud contact center application as well as other applications that can\nhelp distribute self-service information, safety and testing protocols to a\nhealth care provider's internal and external communities.\n\n[Zoho](http://www.zoho.com/ \"http://www.zoho.com/\") is launching an emergency\nassistance program for small businesses impacted by the Coronavirus which will\ngive them free access to many of the company's powerful CRM tools for three\nmonths. \u201cEvery bit of help we, and other companies, can offer to keep these\nsmall businesses afloat will go a long way, not just financially but\nemotionally as well,\" Sridhar Vembu, Zoho cofounder and CEO.

The tools are free and are offered for a six-month\nperiod of time, with no commitment required afterwards.\n\nWhat's a COVID-19 \u201cassistant?\u201d According to knowledge platform provider\n[Satisfi Labs](https://satisfilabs.com/ \"https://satisfilabs.com/\"), it's a\n[free artificial intelligence-powered\ntool](https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/CRM-Across-the-\nWire/Satisfi-Labs-Launches-COVID-19-Assistant-139973.aspx\n\"https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/CRM-Across-the-Wire/Satisfi-\nLabs-Launches-COVID-19-Assistant-139973.aspx\") that will specifically help\ncompanies in the sports, tourism, and live entertainment clients answer their\ncustomers' coronavirus-related questions in real time right from their\nwebsites. The Assistant can handle questions automatically and companies using\nit can adjust responses depending on the nature of the question and fast\nchanging current events. There is also an alert feature included so that\ncustomers can request updates when specific information changes at locations.\n\nAnother maker of artificial intelligence software called\n[Gong](http://www.gong.io/ \"http://www.gong.io/\") has [released more\ntools](https://www.salestechstar.com/people-management/sales-coaching/gong-\nreleases-customer-relief-package-to-help-remote-sales-team-work-better-\ntogether/ \"https://www.salestechstar.com/people-management/sales-\ncoaching/gong-releases-customer-relief-package-to-help-remote-sales-team-work-\nbetter-together/\") to help remote salespeople be more productive during these\nwork-from-home days. It\u2019s newly launched Activity Calendar gives managers an\nonline, real-time view of scheduled calls by salesperson and a new tracing\ntool can identify calls and emails where the virus is mentioned by customer as\nwell as the surrounding context of the conversation so that salespeople can be\naware of the problem and when and how it\u2019s affecting their prospects and\ncustomers.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever going to be a time to digitize the business model and\nincrease effectiveness, that time is now. Only those publishers that operate a\nlean and effective organization will survive in this market.\u201d Those words are\nfrom Robert Bergqvist, the CEO of [RunMags](https://www.runmags.com/\n\"https://www.runmags.com/\"), a cloud-based CRM and magazine production tool\ndesigned specifically for print and digital magazine publishers.

They\u2019re using the pandemic\n\u2013 and the fear that comes with it \u2013 to encourage their customers to try things\nthat may have been reluctant to try before. They\u2019re doing this because they\nknow that their customers can benefit from their tools.

ESAP is one way Zoho is committing\nitself to helping its small business customers. For up to 20,000 qualified\npaying customers with 25 employees or less, Zoho is waiving the cost of every\nsingle application they use, for up to 3 months.\n\nZoho is a 24-year-old, bootstrapped, privately held company with more than 50\nmillion users located in over 180 countries. Since the beginning, Zoho has\nowed its existence to its small business customers. While Zoho now has grown\nsignificantly upmarket, supporting mid-market and enterprise customers in\naddition to small businesses, the company believes that for the broader\neconomy to stay healthy, small businesses must first stay healthy and viable.\nESAP is intended to lighten the financial burden put upon our small-business\ncustomers during this chaotic and difficult period.\n\nEarlier this month, Zoho launched\n[Remotely](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.zoho.com_remotely_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=oEsiH5bEUt05fKhe6YAHUVvxKQ7QvS9msjVKKqEDNd37XY3DJJTukExPueWE1v6O&m=GBcH98d1j5zemPFqyHiEhHvWTLDN_B1Rl5fE0-FNdAA&s=m3T0UlPhemDAtay18Zddxpie8Xdpk4_4bCCdkhnU3Po&e=),\na platform of 11 collaboration applications, provided to businesses of all\nsizes around the world for free, so that companies could effectively make the\ntransition to remote work. Since its release two weeks ago, more than 4,600\nnew companies are running on the platform, and that number is increasing every\nday. In the same period, Zoho has seen a 500 per cent growth in usage of its\ncollaboration apps and 1,000 per cent growth in daily new users of Zoho\nMeeting.\n\nBetween this global program and the no-cost availability of Zoho Remotely, a\nfull virtual collaboration platform, Zoho is committed to helping as many\nbusinesses as possible. They are encouraging other companies in a position to\nhelp businesses survive to join us in supporting the small business ecosystem.\n\n####  **Commenting on the launch, John Legg, Founder at The Debug Store\nsaid:**\n\n\"Zoho's generous offer will make a huge difference to small businesses. Zoho\nis one of the world's best-kept business secrets. My business has been using\nZoho tools for many years. It is now based in a home office and it would be\nimpossible to operate effectively without using Zoho One.\"\n\n\"Businesses are hurting. They already face tremendous pressure on revenue and\ncash flows. Not knowing when things will get back to normal is even worse,\"\nsaid Sridhar Vembu, Zoho co-founder and CEO. \"Every bit of help we, and other\ncompanies, can offer to keep these small businesses afloat will go a long way,\nnot just financially but emotionally as well. We are in this together, and\ncontributions from every business help our community get through this\npandemic.\"\n\n\"Certain industries have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, and\nwe strongly encourage our customers in these industries to please apply for\nthis Small Business Emergency Subscription Assistance Program,\" continued\nVembu. \"While we want to provide relief for as many small business customers\nas possible, we will prioritize those who are most in need and hope that\nothers who are adapting to market conditions will help us by allowing program\navailability to those struggling to stay afloat.\"\n\nSridhar Iyengar, MD of [Zoho\nEurope](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.zoho.com_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=eazr8gQwY1z_SXxdrCOWNcy_06mTEtC9ILqB5O4LQ7M&m=z72fJrXoHZccnZKEuzSu94OA_je_4mCx0BulNiPTbqs&s=xO-\nGwuPJanofStUDdtzuKILtqcs-pvNPZPb2-TpmtQ4&e=), adds: \u201cWith COVID-19 disrupting\npeople\u2019s lives, it\u2019s absolutely critical that small businesses are given full\nsupport to continue operating despite the chaos. With huge pressure on\nrevenues, cashflows, and millions of workers worried about the future of their\njobs, being able to log-on and remain productive is essential. This emergency\nprogramme package will provide relief for many small business customers and\nthose struggling to stay afloat. We are proud to offer this support at such a\ncrucial time and hope to play a key role in supporting businesses and their\ncommunities.\u201d\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

If\nyou live under a rock, it might be best to stay there for at least two to four\nmore weeks. Many people are working from home for the very first time and are\nmost likely experiencing something much different than what they have at the\noffice and even what they imagined WFH would be like. I\u2019ve been working\nremotely going on nine years and have learned a lot along the way and forget\njust how foreign it is for most.\n\nFortunately, companies like Google, Cisco, Microsoft, Zoom, and Zoho provide\nservices that allow us to do work from home. I will go through the services\nthey provide for working from home, and some tips from them that will help you\nbring the office home. I have also written a WFH blog with tips from companies\nthat provide WFH infrastructure that you can find\n[here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/#6a4bdd9e640a\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/#6a4bdd9e640a\").\n\n**Cisco**\n\nWebex is Cisco\u2019s collaboration platform to connect teams for sharing\ninformation. It includes two apps, Webex Meetings, and Webex Teams. Both of\nwhich include a mobile and desktop app. Webex Meetings joins the team into a\nvirtual room for a meeting to share and collaborate. It is fully integrated\nwith Microsoft Teams, and people who don\u2019t have Webex Teams can easily join\nthe meeting. Webex Meetings shares information from the team and delivers pre-\nbuilt solutions with third-party apps like Google Drive and Google Calendar\nfrom Webex App Hub.\n\n![Webex Teams has multiple tools to collaborate with teams including video,\nchat, and third-party apps. ](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e821b81281468000685ff4f/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nWebex Teams has multiple tools to collaborate with teams including video,\nchat, and third-party ... [+] apps.\n\nCisco\n\nCisco suggests [here](https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/work-from-home-\nbest-practices \"https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/work-from-home-best-\npractices\") finding a workplace in the home that is comfortable and\nproductive. Set up a workplace so that the background of a video call won\u2019t\ndistract your team. Being able to reduce the distractions that come when\nworking will not only help keep you focused but also your teammates. One of\nthe ways Cisco recommends reducing distractions in a Webex video call is by\nmuting yourself when you\u2019re not talking which is a bit obvious, but you never\nknow. Cisco says video calls help teams interact because it is the closest way\nto having an in-person meeting which I take for granted. Cisco says don\u2019t be\nafraid to show your face! Video calls make it possible to show reactions and\nemotions that phone calls and messages don\u2019t allow.\n\n**Google**\n\nGoogle\u2019s G Suite platform is all of Google\u2019s apps for business. It includes\nGmail, Calendar, Hangouts Meet, Drive, and all of Google\u2019s office apps.\nGoogle\u2019s apps include web apps that are used in the Chrome browser and mobile\napps. App information can be shared securely between teams with collaborative\nDocs, Sheets, and Slides being stored in the Drive. Hangouts Meet is Google\u2019s\napp for meetings. Google\u2019s service also gives your business a custom email. My\ncompany has been using Hangouts for messaging and video and GSuite for our\nback-end services.\n\nTo sum it up, Google\u2019s tips for working at home[\nhere](https://grow.google/remotework/ \"https://grow.google/remotework/\") are\npersonable. Just as we learn differently, we also get work done differently.\nFor example, some people are night owls and work better late, and some are\nmorning people that get things done early. Google emphasizes getting into a\ndaily routine. The goal of making a morning routine is to get into healthy\nhabits that make you a more productive worker. If that means not working in\nyour room where you sleep, so be it. With that being said, a part of having a\ndaily routine is considering your teammates might have a different time slot\nin their day for work. Either because they live on the other side of the globe\nor because their daily routine is different. Net-net, Google says your daily\nroutine shouldn\u2019t affect the communication between your teammates.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is Microsoft\u2019s productivity solutions that include all of\nMicrosoft\u2019s office apps, cloud services, device management solutions, and\nMicrosoft Teams. Office apps include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook,\nOneNote, Skype, and many others. All apps are available on mobile and desktop\nfor cross-platform productivity. Microsoft Teams is a collaboration tool for\nteams to share and brainstorm content, virtually chat, and meet with\nemployees, customers, suppliers, and partners. It also has all of the Office\napps built right in.\n\n![Microsoft Teams is a collaborative tool that lets teams access, share and\nedit content in real time. ](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e821bc9263471000681f530/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nMicrosoft Teams is a collaborative tool that lets teams access, share and edit\ncontent in real time.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s approach to emulating the office\n[here](https://news.microsoft.com/covid-19-response/#remote-working\n\"https://news.microsoft.com/covid-19-response/#remote-working\") is keeping\nteams and management healthy. Microsoft has created\n[guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Work-from-home-guide.pptx\n\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Work-from-home-guide.pptx\") for teams and team\nleaders to discuss with employees rules for working from home so that the\noffice rules are not abandoned. Another way to emulate the office is by giving\nworkers time between meetings to prevent burnout. In the office, teams have\ntime before and between meetings to be social and interact. Inserting a break\nduring these times can prevent burnout. Similarly, provide a way to disconnect\nafter a day of working. Typically, the office and the home are separated. Now\nthat they are the same, it can be difficult to disconnect and transition to\nthe other. Microsoft encourages different ways to disconnect. One of the ways\nMicrosoft disconnects its employees is by offering a virtual meditation\nsession to unwind and focus. Microsoft also recommends promoting team culture\nand having team socials virtually or in team chats.\n\nMy company has used Office or Office 365 for our \u201cfront end\u201d operations for\nnine years.\n\n**Zoho**\n\nZoho is a suite of business software solutions that covers every facet of a\nbusiness. Zoho says it is \u201cthe Operating System for business.\u201d It has\ndifferent bundles that include CRM Plus, Workplace Suite, Finance Suite, IT\nManagement Suite, and an HR Suite. Its newest bundle is Zoho Remotely, to help\nwith businesses that are now working remotely. It is free during the\nCoronavirus crisis until the first of July. It includes apps to meet online\nand communicate, collaborate in teams, assist with employees and customers and\noffice apps for content creation. Zoho has been building its app portfolio\nsince 2005. It built Zoho Remotely in less than a week. That is impressive.\n\n![Zoho remotely offers a suite of web and mobile apps for collaboration,\ncommunication, and productivity](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e821cb3263471000681f547/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nZoho remotely offers a suite of web and mobile apps for collaboration,\ncommunication, and ... [+] productivity.\n\nZoho\n\nZoho\u2019s first piece of advice [here](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/blog/become-\nremote-work-ready-tips-best-practices.html\n\"https://www.zoho.com/remotely/blog/become-remote-work-ready-tips-best-\npractices.html\") is to set yourself up for success. Like the other WFH service\nproviders, put yourself in a position where you are the most productive. Not\nonly physically, but also mentally. Keep your purpose in mind. Have a mindset\nthat you are your own boss. Not that you should undermine your boss but more\nso to look at your work as indispensable. Self-motivation is a key practice in\nbeing productive, especially when no one is around. To make this applicable,\nZoho recommends setting short term goals with rewards that are independent of\nyour work. Relate this to your team to spread motivation and ultimately\ncollaborate better. The next tip from Zoho is to create a culture of\nasynchronous collaboration. Set apart times to complete different tasks. This\nseparation puts a short-term goal and allows you to focus and prioritize tasks\nappropriately.\n\nApart of Zoho\u2019s initiative to fight the global crisis is its Small Business\nEmergency Subscription Assistance Program ([ESAP](https://www.zoho.com/esap/\n\"https://www.zoho.com/esap/\")). This program is to assist its small business\ncustomers who are struggling by giving them the Zoho software they use\ncurrently for free for three months. All Zoho customers with 25 employees or\nfewer who have been severely impacted by the coronavirus-related downturn may\napply.\n\n**Zoom**\n\nZoom is another video and collaboration software platform for teams. Zoom\nMeetings is its media conferencing app for mobile and desktop. It can support\nup 1,000 video participants and 49 videos on the screen. It has built-in\ncollaboration tools to share screens and co-annotate content. It records and\ntranscribes the meetings into searchable transcripts. Third-party apps like\nMicrosoft Teams are integrated into Zoom Meetings to enhance collaboration.\n\nZoom\u2019s first tip, which you can find\n[here](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/04/best-practices-for-hosting-a-\ndigital-event/ \"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/04/best-practices-for-\nhosting-a-digital-event/\"), when conducting an event online is distinguishing\nbetween a Webinar, where attendees will primarily listen, and a meeting, where\nattendees will actively participate. For hosting one of these events, make\nsure everything is working properly-internet connection is secure, the audio\nand video are working, and the content being shared works. As the host of a\nwebinar or meeting, ensure attendees know the expectations and tone of the\nevent as they would in a face-to-face event. Enable Q&A, ask for feedback, and\nencourage attendees and participants by using features like polling and Zoom\u2019s\nreaction feature. Zoom, unlike offerings from Google, Microsoft, Zoho or\nCisco.\n\nMake sure you are comfortable with Zoom\u2019s [privacy\npolicy](https://zoom.us/privacy \"https://zoom.us/privacy\") as, to me, it seems\nopen to a lot of interpretation about what personal or corporate information\nit and its partners will or won\u2019t share or barter in the future. For\nbusinesses,\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nMost, if not all, of these tips can be wrapped up into a couple of over-\narching tips. The first being, find a comfortable and productive place to\nwork. You know yourself and at home you the freedom to make a productive\nenvironment. The second is to have a healthy and productive mindset. Adjusting\nand adapting to a WFH environment can be difficult, and sometimes\nintimidating, but the right mindset brings pleasure to your workplace. The\nlast over-arching tip is to communicate on multiple different platforms.\nCommunication between teams is an essential component of working from home and\ncan determine the success of your experience with working from home.\n\nI imagine that after the crisis, working from home will be a more permanent\nthing for many people. It is a new experience for most people. Hopefully,\nthese tips from these top WFH service providers will help the transition to\nwork from home.\n\n  \n\n_Note: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this\narticle._\n\n_Disclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms,\nprovides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to\nmany high-tech companies in the industry, including Amazon.com, Advanced Micro\nDevices, Apstra, ARM Holdings, Aruba Networks, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\nBitfusion, Cisco Systems, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo\nTechnologies, Digital Optics, Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Foxconn, Frame,\nFujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google, HP Inc.,\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Intel, Interdigital,\nJabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux\nFoundation, MACOM (Applied Micro), MapBox, Mavenir, Mesosphere, Microsoft,\nNational Instruments, NetApp, NOKIA, Nortek, NVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG,\nOpenStack Foundation, Panasas, Peraso, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Portworx,\nPure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus, Rayvolt E-Bikes, Red Hat, Samsung\nElectronics, Silver Peak, SONY, Springpath, Sprint, Stratus Technologies,\nSymantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, TensTorrent, Tobii Technology, Twitter, Unity\nTechnologies, Verizon Communications, Vidyo, Wave Computing, Wellsmith,\nXilinx, Zebra, which may be cited in this article._\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/patrickmoorhead) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patmoorhead).

physical proximity. Zoom\nlets you create and host meetings, but it isn\u2019t the only online video\nconferencing solution out there. With anecdotal reports of slow connections\nand dropped calls, some might be looking for a secondary option.

However, Google\u2019s [enterprise-\nlevel G-Suite service](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/) includes a\n[version of Hangouts](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/) that is\nperfect for companies that need to find a new video conferencing app. It can\nbe used for text, voice, and video chats, it lets you connect with up to 250\nother users per call, and it has robust moderation and presentation features.\nYou can even record meetings.  \n\nThe free version of Hangouts is a viable choice, too, supporting up to 150\nusers, but it requires users to connect using their personal Google accounts,\nwhich may exclude those who don\u2019t have one. The free version also lacks the\npresentation options, nor can you record calls, but that 150-user limit is\nhard to beat compared to other freebies out there.\n([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&hl=en),\n[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hangouts/id643496868),\n[web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-\nhangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en))  \n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### [Zoho Meetings](https://www.zoho.com/meeting/free-online-meeting.html)\n\n![Illustration for article titled The Best Alternatives to Zoom for Remote\nMeetings](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nScreenshot: [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/meeting/)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to go with Google\u2019s G-Suite service, the open-source\nalternative Zoho One includes online conferencing software that should appeal\nto anyone familiar with Zoom or Hangouts.\n\nZoho Meetings lets you host end-to-end encrypted video meetings, conference\ncalls, and webinars, all of which can be accessed through dial-ins and email\nlinks\u2014you don\u2019t need to force anyone to sign up or download an app in order to\njoin in. There are also desktop, web, and mobile versions of the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can record your meetings, and the hosting options include moderation and\norganization tools. The software also integrates with Zoho\u2019s Office app suite,\nso you can pull in spreadsheets, text documents, and other files easily during\nyour presentation. Zoho even has a [handy comparison sheet showing how it\ncompares to Zoom](https://www.zoho.com/meeting/zoom-alternative.html).\n\n#### [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/)\n\nZencastr is technically a web-based podcasting service and doesn\u2019t do video\ncalls, but it\u2019s excellent for conference calls. Amid the COVID-19 outbreak,\n[Zencastr is lifting its restrictions on group size and recording\nlimits.](http://Discord Discord is a gaming-forward app, but it has a broader\nappeal than just gaming thanks to its encrypted chats and flexible\norganization features. Discord chats take place on dedicated \u201cservers\u201d that\nusers can set up and organize themselves. Each serve can have its own text,\nvoice, and video chat rooms. Video calls only support 9 users in total, but\nthe app includes simply screen-sharing tools and other handy features if\nyou\u2019re using it to hold meetings. The biggest caveat with Discord is that\nsetting up a server and getting everyone invited and signed up can take\ntime\u2014though once you\u2019ve made your server it\u2019s easy to send invites. There\u2019s a\nlot of flexibility here and it\u2019s a much more permanent solution, but Zoom and\nother apps in this list will be faster to get up and running.) Free users can\nnow host calls with unlimited users and unlimited recording time (normally\nonly three users per call and 8 hours of recording time per month, though\nunrecorded calls don\u2019t count).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaid users ($20/month) get a special live editing dashboard and post-\nproduction tools. Only the host needs to have a Zencastr account, as they can\ninvite users through simple shareable links (like you can with Zoom). There\u2019s\nalso a \u201chand raise\u201d button that can help keep things running smoothly when\nyou\u2019re hosting a large conference call and want to make sure everyone can\nchime in.\n\n* * *\n\n### Free alternatives\n\n#### [ **Discord**](https://discordapp.com/)\n\n![Illustration for article titled The Best Alternatives to Zoom for Remote\nMeetings](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nImage: Discord\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscord is a gaming-focused app, but it has a broader appeal than just gaming\nthanks to its encrypted chats and flexible organization features.

At the time, he\nestimated this style of work to become the norm in about 20 years.\n\nHis estimation was right and remote working did pick up in many parts of the\nworld in recent decades, But in India, its acceptance has remained limited.\n\nA majority of Indian employers\u2014particularly in traditional industries\u2014do not\nallow work from home. Even as new-age startups are open to remote working, at\nlarger companies, it\u2019s an option that is often offered as a perk or for\nspecial needs.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has, however, made remote working a necessity\novernight.\n\nOver recent weeks, several Indian companies have mandated their staff to work\nfrom home in an attempt to socially distance people and reduce the spread of\nCovid-19.\n\nBut why did Indian companies wait for a pandemic to adopt a practice that has\nmany benefits, for both employees and employers?\n\n\u201cWith globalisation, teams are spread all over the world and technology\nfacilitates us to work from anywhere, anytime,\u201d said Harriet Molyneaux,\nmanaging director of Hot Spots Movement, a London-based specialist research\nconsultancy focused on the future of work. \u201cThe rise of the gig economy means\nthat many people work for themselves and do this from their own homes as a\ncost-effective solution to office space.\u201d\n\n## \u201cWork\u201d is not a place\n\nMeera Sapra knows the benefits of working from home all too well. A marketing\nlead at Chennai-based online office suite provider Zoho, Sapra has been\nworking remotely for 12 years now. After her employer recently made it\nmandatory for all of its over 8,000 employees to work remotely, she feels her\npeers are performing better than before.\n\n\u201cRemote working enables my team to think at its own pace,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\nhas their own physical and mental space and I have noticed better quality of\nideas that have come up. Digital presence has its own kind of serendipity that\nphysical presence does not; digital presence makes you value a co-worker\u2019s\ntime much more.\u201d\n\nAt Delhi-based software testing startup Wingify, the staff is \u201clearning to use\nexisting technology more efficiently and creatively\u201d while working from home,\nsaid founder and chairperson Paras Chopra. The company\u2019s staff of over 230 has\nbeen working remotely for about 15 days now. \u201cThe silver lining we will see\nare the benefits to the environment as more conferences go virtual,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite all its benefits, a sudden shift to remote working can prove\ndisruptive.\n\n## It can\u2019t happen overnight\n\nWhile smaller startups are swiftly finding workarounds, in some businesses,\nsuch as banking, financial services or firms that deal with critical data, it\nmight be almost impossible to make teams work remotely all of a sudden.\n\nEven for young companies, it isn\u2019t a cakewalk.\n\nWhen Bengaluru-based human resource tech startup SpringWorks (previously\nSpringRole) recently asked all of its 150 employees to work from home, they\ncomplained about missing their watercooler conversations.\n\n![India-work-from-homee](https://cms.qz.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/WhatsApp-\nImage-2020-03-17-at-12.38.02-AM.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all&w=450&h=349&crop=1)\n\nNisha Ramchandani\n\nMandaville sent this note to his team to set best practices for working from\nhome.\n\n\u201cOur challenge was to mitigate loneliness,\u201d said SpringWorks CEO Kartik\nMandaville. \u201cWe have come up with a couple of solutions, including a mass\ncoffee break where all employees login over a video call in the evenings for\ncoffee or virtual birthday celebrations.\u201d\n\nIt is essential that companies that have been forced to roll out remote\nworking for employees amid coronavirus outbreak, interact with their staff\nfrequently and clearly, Mandaville said. In addition, a conscious effort must\nbe made to document each conversation and make it available to employees so\nthey can reference it as and when needed.\n\nFor remote working to be effective, an organisation needs a shift in its\nculture and managerial mindset. Companies must prepare for situations where\nemployees hesitate in asking certain questions over emails or instant\nmessengers, or managers are not effective in virtually responding to queries.\n\n\u201cManagers will have to be trained to handle people differently in this new\nworld of work,\u201d said Gautham Ghosh, a digital HR consultant. \u201cPolicies will\nhave to change. Take for example, what is the etiquette of conducting meetings\nonline and who follows it up?\u201d\n\n[![Need to Know: Coronavirus](https://cms.qz.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/coronavirus/)\n\n[\n\n##### Need to Know: Coronavirus\n\n](/emails/coronavirus/)\n\n##### Want to keep up with Covid-19?

So, as a person in our industry, I'm doing\na lot of research and reading and am basically of the same mind as Ray Wang\nand others \u2013 this is not a reason to freak out and panic. It's a reason to\nrespond with the measures that minimize the possibility of infection while the\nexperts do their work and find out how to combat this.\n\nIf I was looking at my schedule last week, I'd have said that I had a busy\nMarch \u2013 and I did. Last week I flew out to San Francisco from Washington\nDulles to do an advisory day with Oracle. However, while I was in San\nFrancisco:\n\n  1. Salesforce cancelled its analyst day this week \u2013 [and announced on a much larger scale that it is cancelling all international and nonessential domestic travel for the month of March](https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-suspending-travel-coronavirus-safety-protocols-employees-2020-3).\n  2. [Adobe cancelled its annual Experience Cloud Summit](https://adage.com/article/digital/adobe-cancels-its-own-summit-amid-coronavirus-fears/2241851), which impacts, if past attendance is any indicator, about 15,000 people. They, as are many others (Nvidia, etc) are moving it to become a virtual event. \n  3. [Oracle cancelled its MBX/MCX event](https://nexinfo.com/events/oracle-modern-business-experience-2020/), which was scheduled toward the end of March. It will be tentatively co-located with Oracle OpenWorld scheduled to take place September 21-24 in Las Vegas. \n  4. [Zoho cancelled its late April national conference Zoholics](http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2020/03/04/zoho-cancels-zoholics-in-austin-amid-concerns-about-the-coronavirus/), which was to be held in Austin Texas.\n  5. Pegasystems cancelled the live PegaWorld, which was to be held May 31 to June 2 and [made it a one day June 2, virtual event](https://pe.ga/2TLo4so).   \n\n  6. Conferences that I'm not attending have been cancelled by the dozens, [including most recently SXSW](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/arts/music/sxsw-cancelled.html). Multiple other companies are either planning to or thinking about cancelling events and restricting travel. I'm just waiting for plugs to be pulled.\n\nThis had started before I left. When I got to Dulles, it was eerily empty and\nthe flight to San Francisco was light \u2013 which is literally the first time I\ncan remember that in years. The Dulles to SFO route is routinely packed \u2013\nuntil that day. The San Francisco airport was pretty busy \u2013 maybe 15% -20%\ndown from normal but still busy. On the return, the American Express Centurion\nLounge was packed to the walls \u2013 so some things can clearly survive this\noutbreak.\n\nI'm not going to go into all the data. Suffice to say a large part of the tech\nindustry is  [working from home](/article/remote-working-101-professionals-\nguide-to-the-tools-of-the-trade/) . Several companies \u2013 among them [Microsoft,\nZoho, Google, LinkedIn, Intel, Facebook, Amazon, and\nApple](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-has-prompted-these-tech-\ncompanies-to-ask-employees-to-work-from-home-2020-03-05) \u2013 are either\nmandating work from home, or encouraging it very strongly.\n\nSo, I think we can easily conclude, the world is frightened about COVID-19.\nHaving been through the fear of pandemic [once before in 2009 with H1N1 aka\nswine flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza), please remember a\nfew things:\n\n  1. The fear is generated because this is new, and we haven't had the time to get our arms around it. \n  2. The media are doing a terrible job of explaining and instead are not just pandering to the fear but creating a good deal of it. \n  3. The data is going to start coming in shortly, and it will help us understand this.\n  4. Humanity, as fractured as it may be, tends to band together to solve crises of pandemic proportions. And solve them, we do. This too will be solved. \n  5. Please spend time reading up on it and take the ordinary precautions you need to take. \n  6. [Read Ray Wang's post on the Constellation Research blog](https://t.co/TsC9PUMjyw) and also go and read the links that he provides. All in all, that will give you enough info to understand what to do and how to think about it in a reasonable way \u2013 and hopefully will alleviate your fear but retain your concern. \n  7. Additionally, Ray and his team are running a webcast series on how to handle yourself and your business during the COVID-19 scare that you can access [here](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/new-webcast-series-coping-covid-19-your-business-communities-coronavirusbizhacks). \n  8. Zoho is offering a suite of remote productivity tools free until July 1, 2020. [Forbes saw this as \"sensing an opportunity\"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/06/working-at-home-zoho-releases-free-productivity-suite-for-remote-workers-that-it-built-remotely/#507c8e2e7fe8) which makes me think that Forbes doesn't really fully understand Zoho, though they do admire them. The article does point out that Zoho managed to create this suite which Zoho calls, pretty obviously, Remotely \u2013 in week. While of course it is an opportunity, Zoho does it because it is one of those unique companies that cares about what it does for humanity. They are devoted to doing good and solving big problems on the earth \u2013 e.g. hunger and poverty among them, while at the same time building their \"operating system for business.\" I can guarantee you two things: first, that the suite is well engineered and will work, allowing you and your colleagues the ability to work from home and still get the work that you would have done at the office, done. Second, their intent is to help. If something else comes of it, so be it. [Get it here](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/). \n  9. Personally, I am not only making sure that I am washing up with soap and hot water for 20 seconds and keeping my hands off my face, but I am also suspending normal hugging for the month of March. As funny as that sounds, that's not easy for me. [(Check out this 2013 Huffington Post article by Salesforce Chief Evangelist, and all around wonderful person, Vala Afshar if you don't believe me](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_4548_b_2955520)). Though it is kind of funny. I did come up with a COVID-19 modified version of a hug which is the equivalent of a body wide fist bump, though not a chest bump. You'll have to come over to see it. I'm not going anywhere this month. \n\n## The good that tech companies are doing that should be imitated\n\n  1. [The aforementioned Zoho giving away a remote suite](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/).\n  2. [Microsoft paying their hourly workers full wages even when their hours are reduced](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/microsoft-will-pay-hourly-workers-regular-wages-even-if-their-hours-are-reduced-because-of-covid-19-concerns/). This was followed by Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter and Expedia doing the same thing. \n  3. [Microsoft is giving whoever wants it a six month premium Teams subscription so that they can work remotely and collaborate. ](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/coronavirus-microsoft-teams-google-hangouts-meet-free)Also, as of March 10, the free version will lift the limits of the numbers of users and allow all users to schedule video conferences and calls. \n  4. [Amazon, Google and Twitter are doing that following Microsoft's footsteps and paying one month's rent for all small businesses that are operating inside the owned buildings of those companies (mostly Amazon in this latter case)](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/big-tech-commits-to-paying-wages-for-hourly-employees-affected-by-coronavirus-plans/)\n  5. [Despite what you may think of Facebook, it is providing unlimited free ad credits thus access to the World Health Organization to promote accurate information on the crisis](https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10111615249124441/?d=n) and moving to stop fear-mongering and fake cure and prevention ads etc. Criticize as you may, this is a positive step. \n\n## Resources\n\nHere are some great resources to keep you sane \u2013 and safe. Remember, we don't\nknow much about it yet, including the number of actual cases, due to the\nunreported/undiscovered cases. The bad news is that there are a lot more most\nlikely \u2013 but that means some good news too. That means the percentage of those\ndying of the coronavirus is likely much smaller than the reported 3.4% of the\nidentified cases. So, again, keep balanced here and sane, not just safe. Let\nthe experts do what they do and listen to those who are neither panicking or\npromoting panic.\n\n  1. [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)\n  2. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (general info)\n  3. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/index.html) (resources page)\n  4.

Five people to follow on Twitter (highly recommended by Chris Anderson, TED founder and Ray Wang):\n\n[@AdamJKurcharski](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski)\n\n[ @BogochIsaac](https://twitter.com/BogochIsaac)\n\n[@ScottGottliebMD](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD)\n\n[@larrybrilliant](https://twitter.com/larrybrilliant)\n\n[@Laurie_Garrett](https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett)\n\n7\\. [A good explanation on why soap and water work so well on viruses like\nthis](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-\nold-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?fbclid=IwAR3bYfJuFvbcJmUT-\neBXEeigssp3SzPfx4ZhdPSCV97xhibzw-UAwiDaXSM).\n\nFor now, that's about all the support I can provide that stays within what I\ndo actually know. I'm not going to babble on with my \"learned\" opinion on\nthis, going to areas that I have ZERO expertise in. I'm only going to argue\nfor the one thing I am qualified to argue for \u2013 reason rather than panic and\nfear.\n\nThere are no guarantees that we will get through this because nothing in life\nis guaranteed, but let's just say the odds weigh heavily in our favor. Let me\nclose with something I wrote a few years ago about how I think about the\npeople we as a species, are:\n\n> \"The very hallmark of continued human social existence has been that each of\n> us as a human, has an infinite capacity to create something that in some\n> way, incrementally and on occasion profoundly impacts the continued\n> existence of society and the human species. It's happened frequently enough\n> throughout history, with the right combinations of people and resources, to\n> so far, ensure, at least for now, the continued existence and even\n> flourishing of humanity and the cultures and society associated with it,\n> with all their problems, glitches, denial of opportunities, errors of\n> judgment and action, and even criminality. Despite the bad, we survive as a\n> species and grow. Because the good always outweighs the bad, and over time,\n> even if it doesn't seem so, overcomes the bad. That tells you something \u2013\n> human beings, as a rule, are good, not evil, despite the cynics who would\n> have you think otherwise. Complaining doesn't solve problems \u2013 finding\n> solutions to the problems solve them.\"\n\nSo, stay safe, stay home as much as you are able and wash your hands with soap\nand water. We will answer this.\n\n###  Coronavirus Updates\n\n  * [Latest News from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n  * [Critical IT policies and tools

Before self-isolating herself as a precaution against\ncoronavirus, Sharma spent most of her workday in the office and later hung out\nwith colleagues and friends. Now, she\u2019s all alone at home.\n\nFew days ago, during a daily conference call with her team, a colleague cried\nout, saying he wouldn\u2019t take any leave for a month after the lockdown is\nlifted. Everyone laughed.\n\nThis banter and virtual swapping of woes with team members is the one thing\nSharma looks forward to every day. \u201cMy morning conference call is like being\nin a co-working space. We empathize, share tips with each other, laugh,\nsupport and help each other to stay focussed. It feels like we are in it\ntogether,\" she says.\n\nThere is no dearth of technological tools for virtual workplaces. Slack, Zoom,\nMicrosoft Teams, Zoho, Google Hangouts, Cisco WebEx, Trello, among others,\noffer features to chat, collaborate, track projects and be productive.\n\nSince the 21-day nationwide lockdown in view of the covid-19 pandemic, these\ntools have become important also for dealing with loneliness and demotivation.\n\nSharma\u2019s manager, Rumi Ambastha, who heads brand marketing at the startup, for\nexample, has been video-calling her nine team members daily to ensure they are\ndoing well. \u201cMost of them are living alone. So it\u2019s important for them to know\nI\u2019m just a video call away,\" she says.\n\nA recent study by Rice University in the US says stress, loneliness and lack\nof sleep can compromise the immune system, making people more susceptible to\nthe virus if exposed. It is better to videoconference to reduce feelings of\nisolation, suggests Chris Fagundes, the author of the study, in a press\nrelease.\n\nPurvi Sharma, 21, a creative designer at Mobile Premier League, an esports\nstartup in Bengaluru, realized the importance of video calls after a day of\nworking from home. Living away from her family in a PG accommodation, Sharma\nlooks forward to her daily Google Hangouts video call with colleagues. \u201cIt\ngets a little depressing staying alone, but we\u2019re all there for each other\nvirtually and that is comforting,\" she says, adding that interacting on video\nchats also motivates her and gives her day a structure.\n\nBengaluru-based Vijay Mathpal, 29, a marketing specialist at Skillsoft, an\nonline training company, looks forward to his Friday virtual hangout with his\nteam through Cisco WebEx. \u201cI keep my camera on, use GIFs, emoticons as we\ninteract with each other,\" says Mathpal.\n\nCollaborative online tools can help employees retain some of the continuity of\nthe office experience, says Bhavin Turakhia, founder and chief executive of\nFlock, a communication and collaboration platform. \u201cThis is a transition\nperiod and it\u2019s hard. Thankfully technology can bridge some of these gaps,\" he\nadds. In the past two weeks, Flock has seen a 2.6x increase in adoption, with\nvideoconferencing going up by 3.2 times.\n\nOther videoconferencing tools have similar spike in numbers. Zoho has seen an\naverage of 500% growth in usage of its collaboration apps and 1,000% growth in\ndaily new users of Zoho Meeting since the past one month.\n\nTo ensure that people who are working in isolation have some real-time\ninteraction, Skillsoft has made camera-on and online collaboration a company-\nwide directive. This means everything from stand-ups, huddles, meetings,\nplanning sessions daily and weekly are being done through video.\n\nLike Skillsoft, other companies have made regular video chats mandatory to\ncurb isolation. SugarBox Networks, an server infrastructure startup in Mumbai,\ndoes five-minute slots, where people swap ideas on their experience of working\nin the current situation. Tech Mahindra, the IT services company, has\nintroduced a yoga bot who pops on to their screens and reminds employees to do\nbreathing exercises.\n\nHarbinger Systems, a software products and services company, has introduced a\n30-minute programme they call VItaMIN (Virtual Mingling), where around 30\nemployees get together and share their thoughts at the end of the workday, at\n4pm. The managers are also encouraged to do one-on-one interactions, encourage\nthe team to write short stories for the company\u2019s portal and do weekly\ntraining webinars. Randstad India, a HR services company, has daily huddles,\nweekly catch-up meetings through Google Hangouts. In addition, they are\nworking on team building virtually through initiatives like selfies at home\noffice, and celebrating successes and work anniversaries online through\nHangouts. \u201cA colleague is even calling colleagues to wake them up so they can\nbe on time for virtual meetings,\" says Divya Manoj, vice-president, Randstad\nIndia.\n\nAn open line of communication can keep people motivated and cheerful, says\nAmbastha. \u201cI have to take care of them professionally, personally and\nfinancially as these are tough times.\"\n\n_Write to us at businessoflife@livemint.com_\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Group video call: The new co-working\nspace - https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/group-video-\ncall-the-new-co-working-space-11585671521768.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app\nfor latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\)\n\"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Group video call: The new co-working\nspace - https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/group-video-\ncall-the-new-co-working-space-11585671521768.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app\nfor latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\)\n\"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[Work From Home](/topic/work-from-home) [Coronavirus](/topic/coronavirus)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

But to make it work for larger companies, the problem of enterprise scale must be overcome. Here's my rundown of expert tips and resources. \n\n__\n\n![team\nsteps](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2020-03/team-\nsteps_0.jpg?itok=jfcd-32J)\n\n(Shutterstock.com)\n\nIn my last post, [The remote work surge is short-\nterm](https://diginomica.com/remote-work-surge-short-term-if-its-going-stick-\nmisconceptions-must-be-overcome), I officially re-launched my crusade against\nthe office-culture-purists who've kept remote work in check.\n\nBut let's face it - that crusade must be set aside. There's a _much_ bigger\nshort-term issue: enterprises that never attempted remote work at scale are\nnow compelled to do so. People might be scared, but they need to work. Feeling\nproductive doesn't fix everything, but it can keep us connected.\n\nBy now, everyone who's ever donned a pair of bunny slippers and logged into a\nVPN has issued their \"top tips on working from home.\" Don't worry - you're not\ngetting another bland list here. My last piece already covered my favorite\ncontrarian tips, including my [critique of remote video\nevangelists](https://diginomica.com/remote-work-surge-short-term-if-its-going-\nstick-misconceptions-must-be-overcome).\n\nThere's a problem with these lists. They gloss over the issue today's\nemployers must overcome: enterprise scale. When I think about enterprise\nscale, the words that come to mind are: governance, performance, security,\nvisibility, measurement, effective collaboration across time zones, and\naccountability.\n\nNo, those probably aren't the fun parts of remote work. But if you can't check\nthem off your list, your remote teams won't be productive - and they could be\n[vulnerable to opportunistic hackers\nalso](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51838468).\n\n## Remote work at scale - curve balls ahead\n\nIn a Constellation Research webinar, \"A Guide to Remote Work During COVID-19\"\n([replay link](https://www.constellationr.com/media/guide-remote-work-during-\ncovid-19)), Dion Hinchcliffe raised an example I hadn't considered: even in\nSilicon Valley, where broadband is top grade, he's heard from folks running\ninto issues when two members of the household are attempting simultaneous\nvideo conferences.\n\nWe just had a diginomica team member contend with a similar problem, via an\nwifi-expectant family and a broadband speed failure. That's beyond the scope\nof corporate IT troubleshooting.\n\nVendors are stepping up to make resources available to scrambling\ntelecommuters. Under the banner of [Zoho\nRemotely](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/), Zoho has made a core of useful\nproductivity apps available for free until July 1. Free access is limited to\nten Zoho users for a new Zoho sign up; existing Zoho customers can ramp up as\nmany employees as they need for free - as [explained\nhere](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2020/03/10/zoho-remotely-offers-home-\nworking-solution-during-coronavirus/). Meanwhile, TechSmith has made its\nuseful SnagIt screen recording tool [available free through June\n30](https://discover.techsmith.com/remote-techsmith/?utm_source=temp-\ncust&utm_medium=email&utm_content=announcement&utm_campaign=continuity-\nsupport&spMailingID=64267962&spUserID=Mzg4MTMwMTg3MjY3S0&spJobID=1841488747&spReportId=MTg0MTQ4ODc0NwS2),\nas well as its video review software.\n\nIn [Coronavirus is exploding the remote workforce - here's how IT should\nprepare](https://diginomica.com/coronavirus-exploding-remote-workforce-heres-\nhow-it-should-prepare), diginomica contributor Kurt Marko laid out the IT\nissues in play:\n\n> Unfortunately for today's emergency work from home (WFH) policies, the\n> underlying hardware, software and support infrastructure are only designed\n> to accommodate a small subset of the employee population.\n\nThat scale-up can't happen overnight. Obstacles cited by Marko include:\n\n  * VPN Capacity\n  * VoIP capacity and remote number extension\n  * VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) or services\n  * Remote security and client support staff\n\nSolving scale issues amidst a crisis is far from ideal. Marko offers advice on\nmitigating that, including: thorough testing of remote infrastructure, a\ndedicated WFH help team, and, looking ahead, a shift of \"commodified services\"\nlike email to SaaS.\n\nZDNet has twenty years of remote worker management. In [Managing telecommuters\ndue to coronavirus COVID-19? Here are 8 management\ntips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/managing-telecommuters-due-to-novel-\ncoronavirus-here-are-8-management-tips/#ftag=RSSbaffb68), they share some\nproject-tested tips. As they put it: \" _communicate well and often_.\" I\nespecially liked these two:\n\n  * **Quantify and watch your KPIs** \\- \" _Managing a remote team means you need to be more focused on your deliverables and performance metrics. If you're not quantifying work, then it's hard to hit your objectives remotely_.\"\n\nAhh, but there is a delicate balance here:\n\n  * **Don't micromanage** \\- \" _With a remote workforce you're forced to let go of any micromanagement tendencies. You simply can't track your people as well. That reality is good for both the manager and the workforce, but many supervisors won't see it that way at first._ \"\n\nI don't agree that remote work inherently reduces micro-management. It's\npossible to track and ping the living heck out of your team members. I once\nhad a client who obsessively tracked his salespeople's call log activity in\ntheir extranet. I pushed him to back off - after all, salespeople should still\nbe measured by performance. Give me a deal closer who takes a two-hour lunch\nover an extranet junkie.\n\n## Security and tools matter, but they don't add up to culture\n\nThe corporate security issues invoked by a rapid work-from-home push is a post\nunto itself. A good start comes via DarkReading's [COVID-19 Drives Rush to\nRemote Work. Is Your Security Team\nReady?](https://www.darkreading.com/operations/covid-19-drives-rush-to-remote-\nwork-is-your-security-team-ready/d/d-id/1337294?_mc=rss_x_drr_edt_aud_dr_x_x-\nrss-simple) Kelly Sheridan brings out several key points:\n\n  * Documentation and structure for reporting security issues is job one\n  * Multi-factor identification, while not foolproof, is a must\n  * Legacy apps are typically more vulnerable; consider a virtual desktop for those\n  * Invest in threat detection upgrades: \" _Behavioral analytics tools for detecting suspicious activity should be optimized for admins and those who handle critical data._ \"\n\nRight before publication, I interviewed\n[Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/) CEO [Steve\nBeauchamp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbeauchamp/) for his views on\nremote at enterprise scale. About half of Paylocity's 3,500 employees work\nremotely on a permanent basis already; add in the flexible work arrangements,\nand 2/3 of Paylocity's employees are in some type of remote situation. One\noverriding point that came out in his advice was:\n\n> Who do they call when they need help?\n\nThat includes: _how do you get your boss' attention when you need it?_ In a\nremote setting, that's not always simple. When you have an expectant customer\non the phone, you better know how to get what you need - and fast. Beauchamp\nand I talked about the governance/security gotchas you might not expect.\nExample: how do you regulate what gets printed on a home office printer? What\nabout file download protocols?\n\nOn the culture side, Beauchamp is a big believer that you _can_ cultivate a\nterrific culture, even amongst remote employees. It does take some creativity\nand structure; I'll return to that in a future post.\n\nIn his webinar, Hinchcliffe packed in a bunch of info - so check the replay or\nthe [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dhinchcliffe/a-guide-to-remote-work-\nduring-covid19-constellation-research-by-dion-hinchcliffe). I agreed with\nHinchcliffe's point that investing in proper tools can be invaluable:\n\n![remote work\ntools](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_full_desktop/public/images/2020-03/remote-\nwork-tools_0.jpg?itok=bAJdYTk6)\n\n(Constellation Research)\n\n_Slide via Constellation Research's[Guide to to Remote Work for\nCOVID-19](https://www.constellationr.com/media/guide-remote-work-during-\ncovid-19)_\n\nHinchcliffe noted some nifty apps that can improve remote working. On this\nslide, I thought the group mural/whiteboard and the simulated virtual office,\nwhere you can visit each other and share meeting rooms, stood out:\n\n![remote work - software\ntools](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_full_desktop/public/images/2020-03/modern-\nremote-apps_0.jpg?itok=m2J_kezO)\n\n(Constellation Research)\n\n_Slide via Constellation Research's[Guide to to Remote Work for\nCOVID-19](https://www.constellationr.com/media/guide-remote-work-during-\ncovid-19)_\n\nFor some companies, this is not going to be easy. Cultural and data privacy\nobstacles loom largest. As I'm going to press, a new piece on [how Apple's\nculture of secrecy will hinder their remote\nwork](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/14/apple-secrecy-poses-challenge-to-\nworking-from-home/) came out. An Ars Technica piece noted that [High-stakes\nsecurity setups are making remote work\nimpossible](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/high-\nstakes-security-setups-are-making-remote-work-impossible/).\n\nArs Technica's examples, which include power grid and intelligence agency\nworkers, are hard to refute. Other adaptations besides working strictly from\nhome will be needed. But the Redditors who commented pointed out that many\nworkers who were told they could never work from home for various reasons are\nnow hearing a different tune from their employers - as it should be.\n\nEnterprise scale is the hardest obstacle to working at home. But if we want to\nhave anything that resembles a decent economic recovery on the other side of\nthis, we've got to find a way.\n\nFortunately, there are a proliferation of tools coming out to aid in all of\nthis. The latest example:\n\n> If your team is working remotely, take a look at this FREE online course\n> from Hasso Plattner Institute.\n>\n> It covers a lot of interesting aspects for team members and leaders.\n>\n> Introduction to Successful Remote\n> Teamwork:<https://t.co/zLvnbAte9Y>[@openHPI](https://twitter.com/openHPI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n>

Best Defense in Tough Situations\n\n## The key is to focus on getting through it.\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/jeffhaden_336x336_11526.jpg)](/author/jeff-\nhaden)[By Jeff Haden](/author/jeff-haden)Contributing

end of a two-week crisis-management workshop, the instructors made us\npromise to take one thing away from the training.\n\n\"When times get really tough,\" they said, \"don't forget to keep taking a step\nback so you can re-focus on the big picture.\"\n\nLeaders fix problems, especially during emergencies.\n\nYet it's easy to get so caught up in fixing those problems--and, after a\nwhile, in fixing  _any_ problems--that you lose sight of the things you really\nneed to accomplish.\n\nTaking a step back to assess the overall situation? Good advice.\n\nBut what if instead of bringing clarity, the big picture seems too\nchallenging? Too daunting? Too overwhelming?\n\nThat's when you need to take a page from the SEAL playbook, and start thinking\nsmall.\n\nHere's what [Andy Stumpf](https://www.andystumpf.com), a retired Navy SEAL and\nSEAL instructor whose 17-year military career resulted in multiple\ncommendations--including five Bronze Stars--said when [asked by Joe\nRogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S-6d99n2h4) why some SEAL candidates\nquit during BUD/S training:\n\n> When I went back as an instructor... my favorite question [when people quit]\n> was, \"Why? You said this is your lifelong goal, this is all you ever wanted\n> to do...and you quit. Why?\"\n>\n> Time and time again, the answer I got from students was they got\n> overwhelmed. They were doing the opposite of keeping their world small.\n>\n> There's two ways you can look at BUD/S. It's 180 days long. Or you can look\n> at it as a sunrise and a sunset, 180 times.\n>\n> Hell Week is another good example. It starts Sunday in the evening and ends\n> Friday in the afternoon, and you get about two hours of sleep on Wednesday.\n> That's it. It's horrendous to go through. Almost all the attrition occurs\n> from Sunday night until Tuesday morning. Beyond that, you're probably going\n> to make it through.\n>\n> The advice I was given was, \"Don't look at Hell Week as a five-day pipeline.\n> Just make it to your next meal, because they have to feed you every six\n> hours.\"\n>\n> So if I can stack six hours on six hours on six hours, and just focus on\n> getting to the next meal...it doesn't make matter how much I'm in pain,\n> doesn't matter how cold I am...if I can just get to the next meal, get a\n> mental reprieve and mental reset...then I can go on.\n>\n> If you can apply that resilience to setting and approaching your goals from\n> digestible perspectives...you can accomplish an insane amount.\n\n## How to Think Small\n\nOne of the biggest reasons people give up on huge goals...or give up in the\nface of an unexpected challenge...is the distance between  _here_ , where you\nare today, and  _there_ , where you someday hope--or need--to be.\n\nIf today your storefront is closed and your employees are dispersed and\nthere's no end in sight to shutdowns and social distancing...the distance\nbetween here and there can seem insurmountable.\n\nLooking at the big picture? That might only serve to make you want to give up.\nThere's no way to get from here to there.\n\nInstead, decide you'll think small.\n\nSet your goal, then focus all your attention on the process you've created to\nachieve your goal. Decide what you'll care about most is what you need to do\n_today_.\n\nAnd when you accomplish that, allow yourself to feel good about today.\n\nAfter all, you accomplished what you set out to do. That sense of\naccomplishment will give you the motivation--the mental reprieve and reset--\nyou need to do what you need to do tomorrow.\n\nBut only if you think small.\n\nLay out all the steps that will get you through the challenge you face. Then\nbreak that list down into daily chunks. Or even four-hour chunks.\n\nOr, to use Andy's metaphor, into meals.\n\nThen focus on getting to the next day, the next four-hour chunk, or the next\nmeal. And then, only think about the next.\n\nKeep your head down, keep thinking small...and one day you'll realize you\nmanaged to accomplish what once seemed too overwhelming to even consider.\n\nPublished on: Apr 1, 2020\n\nLike this column?

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/india-launches-\nwhatsapp-chatbot/) __\n\nTech companies are acting quickly to install updates and new programs to help\npeople stay safe and informed as the coronavirus continues its worldwide\nspread.\n\nGoogle, for instance, [has\nupdated](https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-people-\ncovid-19-information-and-resources/) its search engine for more specific\ndetails and resources regarding the virus. The search engine company has re-\nformatted its coronavirus-related results to give people the newest, most\naccurate information about the virus, its spread and more. A visual display\nshows a neat clickable bar of options like \u201csymptoms,\u201d \u201cprevention,\u201d\n\u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201cstatistics\u201d that people can navigate.\n\nThe tech giant is also listing national and local resources people can utilize\nto find out the latest updates specific to where they are.\n\nIn other news, Apple has [programmed\nSiri](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/21/apple-updated-siri-to-help-people-who-\nask-if-they-have-coronavirus.html) to give users a list of questions to aid\nthem if they inquire about potentially having the virus.\n\nFor example, if someone asks, \u201cHey Siri, how do I tell if I have the\ncoronavirus?\u201d then the robotic voice assistant will walk the user through a\nset of the symptoms: is the user in question feeling feverish? Do they have a\ndry cough or a shortness of breath?\n\nThen, if the user has extreme or dire symptoms, Siri will advise them to call\n911. If the symptoms are more mild, Siri will advise them to stay home, avoid\nbeing too close to other people and contact a doctor if the symptoms worsen.\nSiri also provides a link to the App Store, which has apps available for long-\ndistance medical examinations if necessary.\n\nAnd in India, popular social media app WhatsApp has engineered the [\u201cMyGov\nCorona Helpdesk\u201d](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/21/india-whatsapp-mygov-\ncorona-helpdesk-bot/) for all citizens to turn to for information and\nresources regarding the virus.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said citizens could contact the bot for questions\nsuch as how to tell if one is infected or what to do if one is experiencing\nsymptoms.\n\nThe bot was crafted by [Haptik Technologies](https://haptik.ai/), which is\nbased in Mumbai and was acquired by telecom giant [Reliance\nJio](https://www.jio.com/) last year.

Tan,](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Aaron-Tan) TechTarget\n\nPublished: 07 Apr 2020\n\nWhen employees at a Japanese multinational firm started telecommuting in early\nMarch 2020 in response to the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, it was a marked\nshift from how they had previously gone about their daily work.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge change for us as we have never seriously considered the idea of\n[working from\nhome](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480269/Covid-19-Three-steps-to-\nremote-working-effectiveness), let alone try it out,\u201d says Nigel Lim, a senior\nIT manager at the firm. \u201cWe have also eliminated all non-essential business\ntrips and started using various means of collaboration, which is another\nfirst.\u201d\n\nThe air of change looms large, even though the company already had [business\ncontinuity plans](https://www.computerweekly.com/resources/Business-\ncontinuity-planning) (BCP) and has conducted annual simulations of them. It\nalso has alternative office locations, as well as designated core business\nprocesses and IT services to support its BCP.\n\nYet, when it came to the actual execution of those plans, the firm soon found\nthat its [virtual private\nnetwork](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-private-\nnetwork) (VPN) capacity and access licences were lacking. It had to work with\nits IT supplier, which offered options to increase capacity in flexible\ncontracts.\n\nLikewise, a social enterprise has had to strengthen its IT infrastructure in\nareas that did not have redundancy. \u201cWe drove significant cyber security\nawareness in the past, but issued new guidelines on security when working from\nhome,\u201d its CIO tells Computer Weekly.\n\n\u201cThe technology is there to help people work remotely, but many still find it\nchallenging when the need arises to have group discussions or brainstorming.\nThe digital tools are still not very effective for such tasks.\u201d\n\nIn Malaysia, iPay88 is allowing employees in non-IT functions such as finance\nand operations to work from home. To ensure security is up to par, the payment\ncompany has equipped its staff with laptops and additional VPN licences for\nthose who usually work from a desktop.\n\n\u201cBeing a payments company, our biggest challenge isn\u2019t the technology,\u201d says\nLim Kok Hing, founder and executive director of iPay88. \u201cWhat we are\nchallenged by is the loss of the sense of being connected to one another in\nperson physically, so we try to stay online and conduct more training to keep\nup our contact hours with one another.\u201d\n\nTechnology companies appear to be a tad better at handling the situation. At\nZoho, a supplier of software-as-a-service\n([SaaS](https://www.computerweekly.com/resources/Software-as-a-Service-SaaS))\napplications founded in India, enabling more than 8,000 employees to work from\nhome was a seamless exercise, says Gibu Matthew, its Asia-Pacific vice-\npresident and general manager.\n\n\u201cThis is because we build and sell software tools that address an\norganisation\u2019s operational, administrative, HR, sales, marketing and customer\nrelations needs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been using our tools and this facilitated\nthe quick transition.\n\n> One large simulation per year is typical, and when they do conduct\n> exercises, they\u2019re not selecting a pandemic as the scenario  **Forrester**\n> __\n\n\u201cHence there are not many changes in the way we operate because we\u2019ve been\nable to sustain our productivity through continuous communication and\ncollaboration with our internal and external stakeholders, using the same\ntools that we normally use.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts generally agree that having a BCP in place and tweaking those\nplans as circumstances change is crucial to help organisations respond to\ndisruptive incidents.\n\nGuannan Lu, an analyst at Forrester, says companies should sustain product and\nservice quality for high-value customers, encourage remote work to reduce\nvirus transmission and use multiple suppliers in different geographies to\nimprove their resilience.\n\n\u201cAlso, they need to keep updated on logistics restrictions faced by suppliers\nand partners,\u201d he says. \u201cFor single-source suppliers, evaluate their BCP and\nprioritise partners and suppliers so that you can help them immediately as\nthey need.\u201d\n\nAt SAP, BCPs have been developed by its business, support and cloud delivery\nteams to safeguard the health of employees and minimise the impact on the\ndelivery of services to customers, says Richard McLean, its chief financial\nofficer in Asia-Pacific and Japan.\n\n\u201cFor most teams, work can be conducted through remote connections, which\nenable teams to work off-site for most tasks,\u201d he says. \u201cEngineers around the\nglobe are working separately and remotely where possible to mitigate the risk\nof an entire team becoming infected. In datacentre locations, SAP has also\nsourced gloves and masks for the protection of on-site technicians where\nrequired.\u201d\n\n### __Customised response\n\nSAP has also formed a global pandemic task force to ensure it can mount a\ncustomised response to the outbreak, but many organisations still don\u2019t have\nscenario-specific BCPs, according to Forrester. Instead, they create BCPs that\naddress the loss or impact, such as loss of facilities, technology or people.\n\n\u201cImpact-based BCPs are useful because response teams can invoke them\nregardless of the event, but they are far less helpful when the scenario\nrequires a very customised response \u2013 and pandemics require just that,\u201d it\nsays.\n\nForrester also advises organisations to exercise their pandemic plans, which\nmany still fail to do on a regular basis, going by its data and direct\nexperience with enterprises.\n\n\u201cOne large simulation per year is typical, and when they do conduct exercises,\nthey are not selecting a pandemic as the scenario,\u201d says the analyst firm.\n\u201cScheduling exercises with enough business involvement and support is\ndifficult, so when organisations do it, they opt for the most probable and\nhigh-impact scenarios, and extreme weather and IT failures usually top that\nlist.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, both the emergence and the spread of pandemics are difficult\nto predict, so organisations have left them out of the scenarios they cycle\nthrough for their exercises.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, companies are finding gaps in their BCPs after putting their\nplans to the test. Zoho, for one, found it had to figure out ways to route\ncalls made to its support phone line to technicians working from home.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about thousands of calls,\u201d says Matthew. \u201cThese calls had to\nbe routed to people who were physically present in different places. But,\nthankfully, by being connected to the internet, we were able to pull this\noff.\u201d\n\n### __Keys to success\n\nGiven the sudden surge of employees working remotely, how enterprises handle\nthis change becomes increasingly important during this period. Bill Zeng,\nPoly\u2019s chief technology officer for Asia-Pacific, highlights three key things\nto consider \u2013 connectivity, enterprise infrastructure and remote management\ntools.\n\nFirst, users need fast and reliable internet access to ensure decent uplink\nand downlink connections for two-way video and content sharing, he says. Users\nwith limited uplink connectivity might have to turn off their camera to\nimprove voice quality.\n\nAs for enterprise infrastructure, Zeng points out the differences in how\ntraffic is routed from users to [unified\ncommunications](https://www.computerweekly.com/resources/Unified-\ncommunications) (UC) platforms that run on enterprise networks versus the\npublic cloud.\n\n#### Read more about Covid-19 developments in APAC\n\n  * Larger [Malaysian enterprises have business continuity plans](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Malaysias-business-continuity-planning-readiness-a-mix-bag) in place, but SMEs lag behind and will find it harder to weather the Covid-19 storm.\n  * Singapore\u2019s Government Technology Agency is [contributing the source codes](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480501/Singapore-government-to-open-source-contact-tracing-protocol) of the protocol that powers its contact-tracing app to help stem the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.\n  * China\u2019s tech sector will [bear the brunt of the ongoing Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478746/Chinas-tech-sector-to-shrink-by-10-in-Q1-amid-virus-outbreak) on the back of an expected hit on the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n  * Australia\u2019s NBN Co and five retail service providers have [formed a working group](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481044/Australian-broadband-providers-team-up-to-meet-network-demand) to manage congestion and take steps to address the surge in demand for broadband connectivity amid the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cFor cloud-based UC platforms, enterprises will just need to ensure they have\nenough licences to support multiple logins,\u201d he says. \u201cThe traffic from users\nwill go directly to the cloud, such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom, without having\nto go through enterprise networks.\u201d\n\nBut for on-premise UC systems, users will need to increase their collaboration\nedge capacity to cater for the greater number of users from outside the\noffice. Enterprise internet gateway capabilities will also need to be\nincreased.\n\nFinally, with more employees working from home, Zeng says it is critical for\nIT to be able to manage their devices remotely. Management tools will help IT\nteams upgrade employees\u2019 software, monitor status, troubleshoot issues \u2013 and\nto fully understand how users are working remotely so that enterprises can\nexecute their BCPs successfully.\n\nSAP\u2019s McLean says the company is using its [Qualtrics Remote Work\nPulse](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252475127/ITs-technology-\nexperience-problem-gets-HR-tool) service to obtain information about how\nemployees are coping with the outbreak.\n\n\u201cEmployee welfare is crucial at a time like this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important\nfor us to know our employees feel safe and supported, understand the resources\nand information they require for their work, and be able to act quickly to\nhelp our employees.\u201d\n\n_Additional reporting by Edwin Yapp_\n\n####  __Read more on Business continuity planning\n\n  * [\n\n##### Coronavirus threats ramp up as more hospitals come under attack\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Alex-Scroxton-2018.jpg) By:\nAlex Scroxton ](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481298/Coronavirus-\nthreats-ramp-up-as-more-hospitals-come-under-attack)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Malaysia\u2019s telemedicine vision gets fresh boost\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Avanti-Kumar-CW-\ncontributor.jpg) By: Avanti Kumar\n](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481183/Malaysias-telemedicine-vision-\ngets-fresh-boost)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Singapore researchers get priority access to HPC resources\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Aaron-Tan-CW.jpg) By: Aaron\nTan ](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481115/Singapore-researchers-get-\npriority-access-to-HPC-resources)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Malaysia\u2019s business continuity planning readiness a mixed bag\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Edwin-Yapp-CW-\ncontributor.jpg) By: Edwin Yapp\n](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Malaysias-business-continuity-\nplanning-readiness-a-mix-bag)\n\n__Latest News\n\n  * [Judge refuses to delay Assange's extradition hearing over coronavirus pandemic](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481299/Judge-refuses-to-delay-Assanges-extradition-hearing-over-coronavirus-pandemic)\n  * [Coronavirus: Home business opportunity knocks for consumer IoT suppliers](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481286/Coronavirus-Home-business-opportunity-knocks-for-consumer-IoT-suppliers)\n  * [Happy developers write secure code, report claims](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481215/Happy-developers-write-secure-code-report-claims)\n  * [View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n__Download CW Asia-Pacific\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/APAC-0320-cover-252px.jpg)](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-Pacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre) In The Current Issue:\n    * Inside the security operations centre: The nerve centre of security operations\n    * Defining and evaluating SOC as a service\n[ Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-\nPacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre)\n\n__Latest Blog Posts\n\n  * [Combatting Covid Fraud: both doorstep and on-line: clarifying the sources of guidance](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/When-IT-Meets-Politics/Combatting-Covid-Fraud-both-doorstep-and-on-line-clarifying-the-sources-of-guidance) - When IT Meets Politics\n  * [IT modernisation series \u2013 Riverbed: Don\u2019t leave ops in the dark](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/IT-modernisation-series-Riverbed-Dont-leave-ops-in-the-dark) - CW Developer Network\n  * [View All Blogs](https://www.computerweekly.com/blogs)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Malaysia\u2019s business continuity planning readiness a ...](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Malaysias-business-continuity-planning-readiness-a-mix-bag) - ComputerWeekly.com\n  * [HR response to COVID-19 can lower or boost employee ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-response-to-COVID-19-can-kill-or-boost-employee-experience) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Risk & Repeat: COVID-19 boosting social engineering ...](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/podcast/Risk-Repeat-COVID-19-boosting-social-engineering-attacks) - SearchSecurity\n\n####  __Start the conversation\n\n###  __ 0 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

Government agencies and\nhospitals on the frontline of tackling the COVID-19 crisis are also looking\nfor software that can help teams get to grips with the virus, and to share\ninformation with one another and with the wider world. And schools and\nuniversities are ramping up their ability to deliver teaching remotely as\nclassrooms and campuses close.\n\nIn response, business software and services companies are rolling out a\ngrowing number of free products and services, as well as free customer\nupgrades to more advanced tools, to help organizations cope with the\nconsequences of the pandemic. \u201cIn times like this, everyone needs to come\ntogether and help,\u201d says Chris Bedi, the CIO of ServiceNow, one of the\ncompanies that has released a number of free applications.\n\nThis is our latest take on some of the products and services already out\nthere. It highlights the technologies involved and provides a quick summary of\nwhat\u2019s being offered. Things are changing incredibly fast and we\u2019ll be\nupdating the list regularly, so be sure to check in here again soon.\n\n### **Adobe**\n\nToday In: [CIO Network](https://www.forbes.com/cio-network)\n\n  * [\n\n### Former IBM CIO Has Driven A Remarkable Digital Transformation As COO Of\nWorld Fuel Services\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2020/04/07/former-ibm-cio-has-driven-\na-remarkable-digital-transformation-as-coo-of-world-fuel-services/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Unprecedented?

Here are some of the most\npopular questions _Inc._ readers have submitted regarding the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP). Much of the information comes from a recent Inc.com\n[webinar](https://zoom.us/rec/play/upAqdeqr-\nzs3HNeWuQSDVPd-W46-LvqsgHIf_PoImkuyBnFWOwejN7AaauM7WE2Zf-y2S7xph8Vf_jKb) with\nAmi Kassar, an expert on small-business loans and the founder of lending\nadvisory firm MultiFunding.\n\n **1.  What are some key things we need to be aware of to make sure we\nlegitimately qualify for the PPP loans?**\n\nIn general, you're eligible for the PPP loans if your company has fewer than\n500 employees and was in business as of February 15, 2020. Unlike with\ntraditional U.S. Small Business Administration loans, nonprofits, sole\nproprietors, people who are self-employed, and people who make their income as\nindependent contractors are eligible. There had been some confusion about\nwhether having credit available elsewhere makes you ineligible, but we now\nknow that you're eligible regardless of whether you have available credit\nelsewhere. Some industries, including many agricultural industries, define\nsmall businesses differently. **** You can view the [size standards by\nindustry](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/SBA%20Table%20of%20Size%20Standards_Effective%20Aug%2019%2C%202019_Rev.pdf)\n** ** on the SBA website.\n\n **2\\. There's an exclusion for employees earning more than $100,000. Does\nthis mean that their salary is  excluded entirely, or simply capped at\n$100,000?**\n\nIt means that for the purpose of calculating your loan, their salary is capped\nat $100,000. if you have an employee earning a salary of $150,000, for\nexample, the size of your maximum loan will be calculated using a salary of\n$100,000 for that employee.\n\n **3\\. What is the difference between a loan and a grant?**\n\nA grant is a loan that gets forgiven, meaning it doesn't have to be paid back.\nYour PPP loans will be forgiven so long as you don't lay off employees or\nreduce their pay by more than 25 percent (for employees making less than\n$100,000) within eight weeks of receiving the loan. If you do lay off\nemployees, you won't be forgiven for any wages you don't actually pay, but\nyour remaining employees' wages will still be forgiven. Here's more on [how to\nturn a paycheck protection loan into a grant](https://www.inc.com/graham-\nwinfrey/sba-loan-forgiveness-how-to-convert-loans-to-grants.html).\n\n **4\\. If we have already executed layoffs, could we still be eligible for\nloan forgiveness if we bring back our employees?  **\n\nIf you rehire an employee, you'll be able to count their wages for the period\nduring which they are on your payroll.\n\n **5\\. Which banks  will be participating in the payroll protection program?**\n\nA variety of financial institutions will be participating, though many of\nthose details haven't been made public yet. ** ** Kassar says that each will\nlikely have their own criteria for the size of the loans they'll offer. For\nexample, some institutions might only take applications for loans of up to\n$350,000, while others might only offer loans of $1 million to $5 million.\nIt's possible that banks will prioritize working with their existing clients\nfirst, so you should ask the bank you work with if it's participating in the\nprogram and under what criteria. If you don't meet their criteria, check with\nanother bank.\n\n **6\\. As the owner of the business, is my W2 paycheck from my own company\ncovered by the PPP as well?\u200b**\n\nKassar believes business owners' W2 paychecks are included, up to the $100,000\nmaximum.\n\n **7\\. When will the loans be available?**\n\nThis is one of the biggest points of uncertainty. \"It's really hard to\npredict,\" Kassar says. \"People are saying 'Oh great, I'll get these PPP loans\nin a week or two. You can't count on that.\" While the government has said it's\nhopeful they could be available by late next week, Kassar thinks it will\nlikely be [three to four weeks](https://www.inc.com/laura-lorber/paycheck-\nprotection-program-loan-application-delays.html). If you can get a bridge loan\nfrom your bank in the meantime, he says, it's possible you'll be able to\nrefinance it later as a PPP loan, though that will depend on your relationship\nwith your bank.\n\nPublished on: Mar 31, 2020\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"},

Globally, it\nwas already becoming common to take your office with you, wherever you go.\nCOVID-19 has merely accelerated it for millions of organizations globally,\"\nsaid Stephen Mak, Vice President, BlackBerry Spark, Asia and Japan,\nBlackBerry.\n\n\"Benefits aside, remote working also exposes businesses to increased risk.\nAlready we have seen widespread reports of COVID-19 related phishing and\nmalware campaigns that impersonate government, authorities and businesses,\ntargeting both individuals and organizations. This will only increase the\nlonger we face this pandemic, as organizations, data and people remain\nvulnerable to those that exploit the situation.\n\n\"The key point is, securing apps, devices, and firewalls alone is no longer\nenough. Establishing highly functional and secure remote working\ninfrastructures has now become an absolute imperative for businesses to\nmaintain continuity while keeping staff safe remotely,\" he added.\n\n**Schroders**\n\n**Measures** :\n\n  * All offices across its 35 locations globally are fully operational, with most of the employees working remotely, in line with local government advice.

Raju Vegesna 4 minute Read\n\nWorking from home is now a reality for millions of employees around the world,\ncreating a new normal for a slew of businesses and industries. But running a\nsuccessful work environment doesn't change because it's now remote. In a\ntypical office situation, you want to give employees autonomy and help them\nbuild confidence in their own decision-making skills. That shouldn't change in\nthis new (hopefully temporary) environment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, team collaboration remains vital for many of these workers in this\naltered culture, leading to increased reliance on tools such as Slack and\nZoom.\n\nBusinesses of all types and sizes have done a valiant job of pivoting on the\nfly, remaining productive in these trying times in the face of a multitude of\nnew challenges. But it's important for employers not to lose sight of what\nhappens when it comes time to resume business as usual. Anxiety levels within\nthe workforce are already high--a constant barrage of not-so-encouraging news\ncan do that to the psyche--and if employers add to that anxiety by\nmicromanaging or implementing policies that show a lack of trust, there's a\nbig risk for churn post-quarantine.\n\nWhile we have all had fun passing the time by challenging our friends to\nvirtual push-up competitions or listening to celebrities read bedtime stories\nto our kids, the fact is that working from home is bound to cause some level\nof morale drain among the workforce. Many workers simply aren't used to it.\nBut it also creates a huge opportunity for business owners and managers to\ninstill confidence in their teams by showing them the trust and appreciation\nthey deserve.\n\n## The privacy cost of seamless collaboration\n\nThis brings us back to two of the main pillars of this new work from home\nparadigm. The tools are helpful, yes, but using the tracking features in\napplications like Zoom or Slack can ultimately be very problematic. It's\nunderstandable that if the information is there, it can be hard to turn down,\nbut there are other ways to track productivity without being invasive.\n\nJust how meddlesome can these apps be? A quick browse through Zoom's privacy\npolicy becomes instantly alarming. The tool has an \"attendee attention\ntracking\" feature where hosts can see an indicator during a meeting or webinar\nif an attendee doesn't have the Zoom desktop or mobile app in focus for more\nthan 30 seconds while someone is sharing a screen. So, if an email comes\nthrough that an employee needs to respond to immediately, the virtual\ntattletale will let the meeting host know that they're not paying attention.\n\nThis really only scratches the surface when it comes to Zoom's overarching\n[privacy policy](https://zoom.us/privacy), which seems to be that there is no\nprivacy at all. One section of its policy reads, \"Whether you have Zoom\naccount or not, we may collect Personal Data from or about you when you use or\notherwise interact with our Products.\" It goes on to list eight bullets worth\nof the types of information the app is \"allowed\" to collect, including\ninformation about your job, Facebook profile information, and even credit card\ninformation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSlack doesn't fare much better. Employers have the ability to [read all\nmessages](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/24/21079275/slack-private-\nmessages-privacy-law-enforcement-lawsuit) sent through the platform, even\n\"private\" messages. This doesn't mean that employers actually do read their\nemployees' messages, but the possibility is there. As is the case with email,\nit's important for employees to know that anything they send can be read and\npotentially used against them. But again, this sets up a situation where\nmanagers can let their employees know that, barring extreme circumstances,\ntheir private Slack messages are indeed private.\n\n## Winning with employee-centric policies\n\nBoosting employee morale right now can be as simple as laying it out in the\nopen. Commit to a 30- or 60-minute all-hands meeting and alert everyone about\nthe tracking capabilities that Zoom, Slack, and other tools present, and\nreassure employees that they needn't worry because this goes against your own\nbusiness and personal philosophy.\n\nIt really comes down to common sense. Effective managers need to realize and\nappreciate that, in this situation, the workers they depend on may not be\nonline from nine-to-five in the same way that they are under normal office\nconditions. Business owners should really only concern themselves with results\nand not with whether a handful of employees happened to browse away from your\nscreen share for more than 30 seconds.\n\nEmployee privacy has been a cornerstone of my philosophy in my roughly two\ndecades leading a global team. The bottom line is that if your employees feel\nyou're watching over their every move and that you don't trust them, there is\na good chance they'll revolt when we're all back in the office. They'll find\nan employer that values and respects their space. Particularly in today's\nclimate, you have to expect that people's personal lives are going to impact\nthem while working from home. If the work isn't slipping, there should be no\nreason to be suspicious.\n\nMy personal philosophy carries over to Zoho products, which place extreme\nvalue on user privacy in a way that many of today's apps do not. But this\nisn't about implementing the right tools. It's about using those tools in the\nmost responsible way. Only then will business owners and managers instill the\ntrust and confidence in their workforce needed for optimal productivity and\nsuccess over the long haul.\n\n* * *\n\n _Raju Vegesna is the chief evangelist of[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/)._\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n **Leadership Daily Newsletter**\n\nSign Up\n\nReceive special Fast Company offers.\n\n[See All Newsletters](//www.fastcompany.com/newsletters)\n\n## [Video](//fastcompany.com/videos)\n\n### [Impact](/impact)\n\n[Impact\n\n## Out of avocado?

Security 'Missteps'\n\nBy:  [Chris Preimesberger, eWEEK](/Authors/chris-preimesberger \"Posts by Chris\nPreimesberger\") |  April 06, 2020\n\neWEEK NEWS ANALYSIS: Thanks largely to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zoom's number of\nworldwide users has surpassed the 200 million mark, a spectacular rise after\nmarket analyst Apptopia reported it served a mere 12.9 million users on Jan.\n1.\n\n### WEBINAR:  \nOn-Demand\n\nDesktop-as-a-Service Designed for Any Cloud ? Nutanix Frame\n\n  \n\n[~~Watch~~ \u2192\n](http://o1.qnsr.com/cgi/r?WT.qs_dlk=Xo2xCArIhEIAAHQGHEQAAAFK;;n=203;c=1643115;s=14821;x=7936;f=201707241158260;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;k=https%3A%2F%2Fassetform.eweek.com%2Fcontroller%3Fasset%3D246994010%26srvid%3D935613%26vkey%3D11773310%26io%3D233920%26qset%3DCONTACTFORM_HQB%26formHQB%3Dy%26domain%3Dwww.eweek.com)\n\n**Download the authoritative guide:[Big Data: Mining Data for\nRevenue](https://o1.qnsr.com/cgi/r?WT.qs_dlk=Xo2xCArIhEIAAHQGHEQAAAFK;;n=203;c=1668429;s=14821;x=7936;f=201911080913470;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;k=https%3A%2F%2Fassetform.eweek.com%2Fcontroller%3Fasset%3D253713510%26srvid%3D95900%26vkey%3D4190310%26io%3D11111%26qid%3D000%26qset%3DCONTACTFORM_HQB%26formHQB%3Dy%26domain%3Dwww.eweek.com)**\n\n![EricYaunZoom2](/imagesvr_ez/b2bezp/2020/04/EricYaunZoom2.jpg?alias=article_hero)\n\nNot surprisingly, videoconferencing in the spring of 2020 is front and center\nfor IT in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, when most people are sheltering\nsafely at home to ride out the crisis.\n\nSchoolteachers, personal support groups, church committees, business\nassociates\u2014even White House cabinet members\u2014along with myriad other groups and\nindividuals are taking advantage of relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use\nvideoconferencing web applications. These include Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google\nHangouts, Microsoft Teams, Skype, BlueJeans Network, GotoMeeting, Zoho, Adobe\nConnect, Slack and others that are rescuing the culture from non-\nconnectedness.\n\nAll these services are tremendously busy. While Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins\nreported that Webex facilitated more than 5.5 billion meeting-minutes in the\nfirst 17 days of March, Zoom, the freely available web-based video\ncollaboration app, is the one making the most news right now. This is mainly\nbecause of its cost (free for the basic version), quality (generally judged\nhigh by users) and pervasiveness in the online user community.\n\nAs of April 6, Zoom estimates its number of worldwide users to have surpassed\nthe 200 million mark, a spectacular rise after market analyst Apptopia\nreported it served a mere 12.9 million users on Jan. 1.\n\n#### Further reading\n\n  * [ #eWEEKchat April 8: Trends in Collaboration Tools ](/enterprise-apps/eweekchat-april-8-trends-in-collaboration-tools)\n  * [ Zoho Offers Small Businesses Emergency Subscription... ](/enterprise-apps/zoho-offers-small-businesses-emergency-subscription-assistance)\n\n#### 'Zoom Bombing' Becoming More Commonplace\n\nWith great influence come great challenges. You\u2019ve probably heard about the\nphenomenon called Zoom bombing, in which unwelcome intruders join private Zoom\nmeetings and disrupt conversations, insert distractive or abusive comments,\ngather personal information from private discussions and cause other mayhem.\nWell, it\u2019s happening a lot, and companies (such as Tesla) and public\norganizations (such as the New York City School District) have stepped away\nfrom using Zoom due to this security concern.\n\nBecause Zoom sessions have historically had only a nine-, 10- or 11-digit\nidentification number and no password protection, it\u2019s been relatively easy\nfor hackers to punch in a random ID number, join a conference and insert\nunwelcome content, such as racist, sexist, homophobic or pornographic\nmaterial, which they are doing regularly. Zoom now is taking strong action to\ncombat this, but it\u2019s been a major problem only for the last several weeks,\nwhen consumers started using the service more frequently.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate truth here in 2020\u2014as has been the case for decades\u2014that\nmany nefarious people have way too much time on their hands and use the\ninternet to disrupt institutions, faith groups, businesses, governments and\nhuman relationships. IT has been fighting an uphill security battle against\nthese forces for the entire history of the internet, and Zoom's predicament is\nno different from many other companies' experiences.\n\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company, which started up in 2011 and went public\nlast year, simply was not designed for its now-huge user base. Like the\ninternet itself, which was intended for people to use courteously and without\nmalicious intent, Zoom has been a bedrock collaboration tool for enterprises.\nNow CEO Eric Yuan **  (pictured)** and his team are making big-time changes.\n\n#### 'We Grew Too Fast and Had Some Missteps'\n\n\u201cOur service is beautiful, and we were serving our [enterprise] customers\nwell, but during this COVID-19 crisis, we grew too fast and had some\nmissteps,\u201d Yuan said in an interview April 5 with CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. \u201cWe\nexpanded our service but should have enforced passwords, waiting rooms and\nother security measures earlier. In the last two weeks, we took actions to fix\nthose missteps. The new user cases are very different from our traditional\nenterprise customers, where they have IT for support.\n\n\u201cThe security is coming into place now, and we need to focus on education for\nconsumers. For example, we\u2019re in the process of working with the New York City\nSchool District to understand how to use the security settings, to make sure\nZoom bombing does not happen again.\u201d\n\nYuan said that his company \u201chas learned its lesson, and we will double down,\ntriple down, on privacy and security. We want Zoom to be the privacy- and\nsecurity-first company.\u201d\n\n#### What Zoom Is Now Doing to Improve Security\n\nHere are the latest security measures Zoom has enacted:\n\n**Required passwords:** Zoom has enabled passwords on all new participants in\nmeetings and turned on Waiting Rooms by default as additional security\nenhancements to protect user privacy. After they click on the invite URL,\nenter a meeting ID and enter the meeting password, meeting participants then\nmust enter a virtual waiting room until granted access by the host of the\nmeeting. In this way, the host can see who\u2019s trying to enter and grant, or not\ngrant, access.\n\n**Virtual waiting room turned on by default:** Starting April 5, the virtual\nwaiting room feature will be automatically turned on by default. The [Waiting\nRoom](http://click.zoom.us/e/84442/cles-115000332726-Waiting-\nRoom/bjwp63/1504148262?h=PAjLo1hXctsWW11STbh_kt1aIOv_0DqqOFKmXR8xFB0) is just\nlike it sounds: It\u2019s a virtual staging area that prevents people from joining\na meeting until the host is ready.\n\n#### **Meeting Passwords Enabled 'On' for Regular Meetings**\n\nStarting April 5, previously scheduled meetings (including those scheduled via\na host\u2019s Personal Meeting ID) will have passwords enabled. If attendees are\njoining via a meeting link, there will be no change to their joining\nexperience. For attendees joining meetings by manually entering a meeting ID,\nthey will need to enter a password to access the meeting.\n\nFor attendees joining manually, Zoom highly recommends [re-sharing the updated\nmeeting\ninvitation](http://click.zoom.us/e/84442/fhZk1tUtto8/bjwp6m/1504148262?h=PAjLo1hXctsWW11STbh_kt1aIOv_0DqqOFKmXR8xFB0)[\n](http://click.zoom.us/e/84442/fhZk1tUtto8/bjwp6m/1504148262?h=PAjLo1hXctsWW11STbh_kt1aIOv_0DqqOFKmXR8xFB0)before\nyour workweek begins.

Its feature-rich solution competes with popular\nsoftware like [Asana](https://tech.co/project-management-software/asana-\nreview) by prioritizing automation and organization, helping users manage\ntypical day-to-day details and lighten the load across the board.\n\nWith plenty of HR features and helpful third-party integrations available,\nZoho People will allow you to connect your whole system to save your human\nresources department a whole of time and productivity. Reviewers have reported\nthat the Zoho People mobile app can be a bit spotty and unreliable at times.\nBut with a lower price point than many similar softwares, offering four\ndifferent plans on a per employee/per month basis, it's far from a\ndealbreaker.\n\n **In This Guide:**\n\n  * Zoho People Features \n  * Zoho People Pricing \n  * The Verdict \n\n## **Zoho People Features**\n\nOne of the prime benefits of Zoho People is the extensive catalog of features\ndesigned to make human resources easier for employees and managers alike. With\neverything from attendance and leave trackers to performance reporting\nfunctionality, you'll be able to track and tweak your business until\neverything is running smoothly.\n\nTake a look at some of the specific features below, and don't forget to\narrange a quote to find out exactly how much Zoho People is going to cost you.\n\n### Case Management\n\n![Zoho People Case\nManagement](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=)![Zoho\nPeople Case Management](https://images.tech.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/16134144/zoho-people-case-management-640x289.png)The\ngoal of Zoho People is to save time and automate, and the case management\nfeature takes care of both. By providing employees with self-service\nfunctionality, you can alleviate the stress on human resources while providing\nusers with all the information and instructions they need to take care of\nbasics like leave, on-boarding, training, and a wide range of other day-to-day\ndetails that need attention.\n\n### Performance Evaluations\n\nHuman resources is about more than just attendance and vacation days. With\nZoho People, you'll be able to track the performance of employees in a simple,\nintuitive interface. You'll be able to track progress, prioritize projects,\nand provide feedback with star ratings and comments. You can even customize\n[how you track performance](https://www.zoho.com/people/performance-\nappraisal.html) to stay in line with your company goals.\n\n### Document Management\n\nA lot of running a human resources department is keeping track of documents.\nFortunately, with the File Cabinet and e-Signature features, you'll be able to\norganize, manage, and share documents across your company in an instant. Saved\ninto organized folders as PDFs, you'll save a bundle on paper waste while\nmaking life easier for everyone.\n\n### Third Party Integrations\n\nZoho People is designed to make life easier, from top to bottom \u2013 which is why\nit integrates with so many key third party softwares. From GSuite to\nQuickbooks, you'll be able to see everything in one platform. Plus, with\nZoho's massive catalog of softwares \u2013 including Zoho Expense, Zoho Analytics,\nZoho Recruit, and Zoho Projects \u2013 you'll be able to add functionality as you\nsee fit.\n\n **Zoho People Video Overview: Performance Management in Action**\n\nCheck out this video from Zoho People to get a better idea of exactly what\nkind of features are available \u2013 for both human resources departments and\nemployees \u2013 when you get set up with the software.\n\n## **Zoho People Pricing**\n\nZoho People offers four different pricing options, each based on how many\nemployees you have on a monthly basis. Each plan is billed annually, though,\nso make sure you're ready to make a commitment before pulling the trigger.\n\nThe **Essential HR** plan is a mere **$0.83/employee/month** , but offers a\nbare bones version of the software with only leave management and employee\nself-service functionality. The **Professional** plan is also competitive at\nonly **$1.66/employee/month** , but similarly provides few features, adding\nonly the attendance tracker and timesheets functionality.\n\nThe high tier pricing plans are where you really start to see the added\nfeatures. The **Premium** plan, which costs **$2.50/employee/month** , offers\nthe same features as the other two, while also providing shift scheduling,\nreports integration, and basic performance reporting. The most expensive\noffering is the **Enterprise** plan, costing **$4.16/employee/month** , which\nis equipped with advanced performance reporting, multi-rater feedback\ncapabilities, and the Case Management feature mentioned above.\n\n## **Zoho People Review Verdict**\n\nIf you're looking for an all-in-one platform to manage your detailed human\nresource needs, Zoho People is clearly the way to go. With all the basic HR\nfunctionality built right in and the thorough performance reporting features,\nyou'll be able to improve productivity by saving time and making informed\ndecisions.\n\nThe only downfall of Zoho People is inconsistency of the mobile app, which can\nmake it hard to manage day-to-day processes on the go. If you're set up in the\noffice, though, this affordable software has a smooth desktop interface for\nsimple usage.\n\nOverall, between the vast catalog of HR features, the additional performance\ntracking platform, the automated self-service case management, and of course\nthe low price, Zoho People gets a big thumbs up from us.\n\nAbout our links\n\nTech.co is reader-supported.

He's also one of the\nleading philanthropists in the world, so people are paying attention now that\nhe's issued [a grave warning about the latest coronavirus\noutbreak](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/heres-how-amazon-says-you-should-\nhandle-packages-to-prevent-spread-of-coronavirus.html) and what that could\nmean for the economy.\n\nSpeaking by video at a TED Connects event on Tuesday, Gates said that he\nbelieves the world should shut down and people should self-isolate for six to\nten weeks, [according](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/bill-gates-us-missed-\nits-chance-to-avoid-coronavirus-shutdown.html) to CNBC, which viewed the\npresentation. And while he acknowledged that such a lockdown [would be\n\"disastrous\" to the economy](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/jeff-bezos-\nopen-letter-amazon-employees-coronavirus.html), he questioned whether we have\nany other choice.\n\n\"It's very tough to say to people, 'Hey keep going to restaurants, go buy new\nhouses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner, we want you to keep\nspending because there's some politician that thinks GDP growth is what\ncounts,\" Gates said, according to CNBC. \"It's hard to tell people during an\nepidemic ... that they should go about things knowing their activity is\nspreading this disease.\"\n\nIt's a conundrum that has been discussed in more detail in recent days, with\nPresident Donald Trump suggesting he might want to reopen the country and get\npeople back to work by the middle of April, and epidemiologists and other\nexperts suggesting such a move could overrun the public health system and\nendanger more lives.\n\nFor companies, the comments from Gates, who has become one of the leading\nvoices on public health, could be concerning to say the least. On the one\nhand, there is the possibility of keeping the country closed for another\ncouple months and the economic fallout that could come with it. On the other\nhand is the possibilty of putting people's lives in danger.\n\nThat, of course, underscores the enormous need for companies to have\ncontingency plans in place if and when the economy shuts down, as it has right\nnow. Using technology for telecommuting and finding solutions for keeping\nemployees connected is critical.\n\nIt also means that companies shouldn't necessarily expect to be out of the\nwoods anytime soon. After all, if Gates is correct, this difficult time could\ncontinue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWorst of all, Gates says, this could have been avoided. He argued in his TED\npresentation that the U.S. didn't work quickly enough in January, when it\nfirst learned of Covid-19. Even worse, he said we're still unprepared if\nanother pandemic hits.\n\nPublished on: Mar 24, 2020\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore

Two\nweeks ago, he changed his routine. The first thing he now does as soon as he\nreaches the private bank, where he works as a business executive in Delhi, is\nwipe his already-clean desk with a sanitizer.\n\n\u201cYou must have heard... coronavirus is spreading like crazy. My WhatsApp is\nfilled with messages. I don\u2019t want to take any chances,\" says Durgesh, his\nface half hidden behind a mask. The 30-something Durgesh doesn\u2019t have the\nluxury of working from home because \u201cwho will face customers then?\"\n\nWhile thousands of employees have started logging in from their living rooms\nas companies roll out work-from-home drills to combat the spread of novel\ncoronavirus, for many in sectors such as banking, hospitality, media, delivery\nand construction, working from home is just not an option.\n\nD.B. Bhandari, 35, the manager of an upscale eatery in Delhi, took five days\nleave without pay last week because he had a cough and cold. \u201cThe owner didn\u2019t\nwant to take any chances. It was just a regular flu,\" he says, with a sigh of\nrelief. \u201cIn my profession, work from home is not an option, and taking leave\nmeans a salary cut. We wear masks, use sanitizers, and wash our hands as much\nas possible,\" he says.\n\nAcross the world, professionals, usually in tech and white collar jobs at the\nhigher end of the salary scale, have been asked to work from home as companies\ntry to slow the spread of coronavirus, which has infected more than 108,000\npeople worldwide. Globally, companies like Microsoft, Twitter, Amazon,\nFacebook and Chevron have told employees to work remotely. Closer home,\nCognizant India has closed its Hyderabad office; Paytm, its Noida and Gurugram\nbranches; hyper-local platform Nearbuy has shut its Gurugram office; Chennai-\nheadquartered cloud services firm Zoho has asked its 7,500 employees across\nthe world to work from home.\n\nThere are, however, many, like those in restaurants, retail and in the gig\neconomy, who have to choose between staying home and getting paid. The options\ndiminish further if you are a blue-collar worker like a construction worker or\na mechanic. The ratio of blue to white-collar workers, according to India\u2019s\nlabour ministry, is 78:22. What\u2019s worse, their chances of contracting\ninfections is higher than those who work in office environments.\n\nEkart courier\u2019s delivery boy S. Verma, 36, learnt about the virus late last\nweek during a morning team huddle. His manager informed the team about \u201ca\nvirus spreading like a plague\" and told them to protect themselves. \u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t give us any protective gear. I bought a mask yesterday because the\nothers were,\" he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else about it,\" he replies, when\nasked whether he was aware about washing hands regularly and avoiding\nhandshakes. Didn\u2019t he hear about it on TV, radio or WhatsApp? \u201cEighteen hours\na day on the road, who has the time? And if I stay at home, who will feed my\nfamily?\"\n\nRam Lal, a construction worker from Rajasthan, came to know about the \u201cbimari\"\non Sunday when he was buying vegetables for his five-member family from a\nvendor who asked him whether his hands were clean. \u201cI had no idea what he was\ntalking about. My contractor didn\u2019t mention it. The seller told me all about\nit and I\u2019m scared but I can\u2019t sit at home,\" he says. \u201cI cough sometimes during\nthe day while working,\" he adds. \u201cIt could be because of the dust and cement,\nbut now I think it could be coronavirus too.\"\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Coronavirus: For many, work from home is\nnever an option - https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/for-\nmany-work-from-home-is-never-an-option-11583769892323.html %0a%0a%0aDownload\nmint app for latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Coronavirus: For many, work from home is\nnever an option - https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/for-\nmany-work-from-home-is-never-an-option-11583769892323.html %0a%0a%0aDownload\nmint app for latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[Coronavirus](/topic/coronavirus)[Work From Home](/topic/work-from-home)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Now, as I manage a remote team of\nmy own, I know there are some great tools and important best practices to keep\nin mind as you navigate this brave new world.\n\nI break it down into smart tools and soft skills.\n\n## Smart tools\n\nThe great thing about most office work today is that it can be done anywhere\nand anytime. But even better is that working by yourself at home does not mean\nyou have to work alone. There is a plethora of tools out there that allow\npeople to work remotely yet collaboratively.\n\nHere are some of the best:\n\n[Office 365](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-\nproducts?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) and [Teams](https://products.office.com/en-\nUS/microsoft-teams/free): With the cloud version of Microsoft\u2019s well-known\nOffice suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), along with conferencing tools\nlike chat and video calls, you can work anywhere, but together. You can attend\nmeetings online, collaborate on the same document, share files, etc.\n\n[OpenForBusiness.org](https://www.openforbusiness.org/): This is a\ncollaborative effort of tech companies like WebEx, Google and GoToMeeting, who\nare offering free tools right now to help your team work remotely.\n\n[Zoho Remote](https://www.zoho.com/)[ly](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/):\nZoho.com is offering its suite of remote working tools for free until July 1.\n\n[Zoom Chats](https://zoom.us/): Increasingly popular, Zoom chats are\naffordable and a great way to stay in touch.\n\n[Tools](https://www.smallbusinessconnection.com/tools/): Among other things in\nmy other life, I run a great website for Allstate called Small Business\nConnection. Aside from a ton of great, free, small-business content, we have\nassembled almost 100 free tools, many centered around the remote workforce.\nThis eGuide might be very useful \u2013 [\u201cPower your small business with the cloud\nand mobile.\u201d ](https://www.smallbusinessconnection.com/download/eguide-power-\nyour-small-business-with-cloud-and-mobile/)\n\n## Soft skills\n\nThe other part of the equation is that, right now, you need to learn how to\nmanage people with whom you are not in constant physical contact. There is an\nart to it. Here are some of our top tips:\n\n\u2014 Engage regularly: Especially now, it is critical that you stay in contact.\nHave regular check-ins. Chat. Text. Share calendars.\n([Calendy](https://calendly.com/) is excellent for this.)\n\n**More:**[Fed revives funding for business loans, called commercial paper, as\ncoronavirus stresses\nmarket](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/17/coronavirus-fed-\nrevives-funding-short-term-business-loans/5067103002/)\n\n **More:**[As coronavirus spreads, businesses announce nearly 900 layoffs and\nthe total could rise\nsharply](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/13/coronavirus-firms-\nannounced-nearly-900-layoffs-because-pandemic/5043049002/)\n\n **More:**[Plan, don't panic: Strategic small businesses can weather\ncoronavirus\noutbreak](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/03/04/small-\nbusinesses-should-plan-for-coronavirus-disruptions/4943361002/)\n\n\u2014 Video chat: The face-to-face of a video call can go a long way to easing the\nburden and distance of working alone. As mentioned, Zoom chats and the like\nare the way to go. Group conference calls will be especially critical at this\ntime for keeping the team and dream going.\n\n\u2014 Give them the tools they need: Not everyone may be set up for this\ntechnology-based business model I am advocating. To the extent people on your\nteam need help getting up to speed, it is your job to give it to them.\n\n\u2014 Make everyone accountable: Set clear expectations with regard to projects,\ndue-dates and deadlines.\n\n\u2014 Stay informed: As a leader, it is also incumbent upon you to stay informed\nabout the latest coronavirus developments. The best resource we have found so\nfar is from the [Johns Hopkins Center for Health\nSecurity](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/index.html).\n\nToday\u2019s tip: Want to help your favorite local small business? Then buy a gift\ncertificate right now, either in person or online. When the pandemic subsides,\nyou can redeem it, knowing you made a difference at a critical moment.\n\nAlso, watch our other business columnist, Rhonda Abrams, on [Facebook Live\ndaily at 1 p.m EDT](https://www.facebook.com/RhondaAbramsSmallBusiness) for an\nupdate on how coronavirus is affecting small businesses.

from home will likely be a necessity over the next few months at\nleast, so FranklySwiss wants to know what they need to get work done remotely.\nPhotograph: Neil Hall/EPA\n\n> What do I need to work at home during the coronavirus outbreak? At this\n> rate, we might all be working from home for a year! How will the broadband\n> providers cope? Do we need a plan B? **FranklySwiss**\n\nEveryone will need their own customised solution, but there are two things to\nthink about. First, will you be working at home for two weeks or four months\nor possibly forever? I share the view that [Covid-19 could cause a permanent\nshift towards home\nworking](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/13/covid-19-could-\ncause-permanent-shift-towards-home-working).\n\nSecond, who is paying for homeworking equipment and services: you or your\nemployer?\n\nIf you\u2019ll only be working at home for a short time, you can probably get away\nwith not buying much new equipment or signing up to remote working services.\nIf you\u2019re in for the long haul, try to match or preferably beat the equipment\nyou would normally use in the office. If you can\u2019t afford a [ThinkPad\nT490s](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Ft-\nseries%2FThinkPad-T490s%2Fp%2F22TP2TT490S&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating) (\u00a31,213.71), for example, get as\nclose to the specification as possible.\n\nIf you are paying for your own kit, you may want to take an economical\napproach. But if the company is insisting that you work from home, ask for\nergonomic equipment. This often costs more, but is worth it in the long run.\n\nIf your company has an IT department, then it should either supply or advise\nyou on which equipment and software to use. This may well include a\n[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and a two-factor\nauthentication system, such as\n[YubiKey](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2F&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating).\n\nOne of the IT department\u2019s jobs is to make choices for tens or even tens of\nthousands of employees. You may not like their choices \u2013 I usually don\u2019t \u2013 but\nletting everybody pick their own collaborative software, messaging app or\nvideo conferencing system doesn\u2019t work. Of course, this doesn\u2019t prevent people\nfrom setting up unofficial groups on WhatsApp or Facebook.\n\nThe good news is that you may end up being more productive when you don\u2019t\nspend hours commuting or in meetings, taking long lunches or catching up with\nthe latest gossip.\n\nThe bad news is that you have to set and stick to office routines without the\nexternal pressure to turn up on time, take regular meal breaks, and keep to a\nreasonable sleep schedule. Every company has early birds and night owls, so\ntheir work times are likely to diverge. However, you must overlap during some\nagreed office hours when everyone is always available.\n\nSelf-discipline is why much of the advice about working from home includes\nthings such as getting dressed for work, even though you might work just as\nwell in your dressing gown. But if you talk to colleagues or customers over\nvideo links, you must keep up appearances. You will be judged.\n\n## **Temporary office**\n\n![Nice though it may be, your original iMac may not be up to the task of\nworking from\nhome.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ace7bc9bce892f72cc107b6ce7699a26478af02/0_115_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e03d40a8f60603222b6d1efb899a3f1)\n\n[ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F8ace7bc9bce892f72cc107b6ce7699a26478af02%2F0_115_1728_1037%2F1728.jpg)\n[ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What%20do%20I%20need%20to%20work%20from%20home%20due%20to%20coronavirus%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2) [ Pinterest\n](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What%20do%20I%20need%20to%20work%20from%20home%20due%20to%20coronavirus%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F8ace7bc9bce892f72cc107b6ce7699a26478af02%2F0_115_1728_1037%2F1728.jpg)\n\nNice though it may be, your original iMac may not be up to the task of working\nfrom home. Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian\n\nIf you will only be working at home for a short time, you won\u2019t need much in\nthe way of extra equipment. If you have your own laptop, you will only need an\nexternal USB keyboard and mouse, and you may already have those. After that,\nyou can think about a separate monitor, an external hard drive for backup\npurposes, and either a [powered four-port USB\nhub](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fk%3Dpowered%2Bfour-\nport%2BUSB%2Bhub%26i%3Dcomputers&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating) or a [docking\nstation](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fk%3Dusb%2B3%2Bdocking%2Bstation%26i%3Delectronics&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating) to connect them all together.\n\nLaptops have [bad\nergonomics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/jun/20/using-\nlaptops-tablets-physical-pains) so you should not use them for sustained\nperiods of work. You can solve this problem by making your laptop work like a\ndesktop, by putting it on a commercial\n[riser](https://www.feelbetterclinic.co.uk/2017/10/30/laptop-riser-prevent-\nback-pain-neck-pain/) or a pile of books and plugging in an external keyboard\nand mouse. Your eyebrows should be roughly level with the top of the screen,\nso you can work without slouching.\n\nBuy a docking station if you can. If you plug your laptop and all the\nperipherals into a docking station, you only need to unplug a single cable\nfrom the laptop to be able to take it somewhere else. That makes it easy to\nget a change of scene by working in another room or in the garden.\n\nOne major problem with working on a laptop is that most domestic tables and\nmany desks are too high. Your arms should be angled slightly downwards when\nyou are typing, not upwards. You can solve this problem by buying an accessory\n[keyboard tray](http://ergonomictrends.com/tips-picking-best-ergonomic-\nkeyboard-tray/), where the keyboard sits under the table top, or an\n[adjustable\nchair](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB06Y4CQS2W&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating), where seat height is the key\ndimension. However, both of those are getting into home office territory.\n\nOtherwise, the supreme law for working from home is _thou shalt not lose thy\nwork_. Make hitting Ctrl-S (for save) a reflex action. Save files to your\nlocal hard drive and to an online drive (OneDrive is built into Windows 10),\nand back them up to an external hard drive or USB thumb drive. Even if you are\nsaving your work on a company server or in an online office suite \u2013 such as\nMicrosoft, Google or Zoho \u2013 you may need a local copy if your comms link goes\ndown.\n\n## **Permanent office**\n\n![If you can set up a home office in a disused room then it\u2019s a lot easier to\nget a set up that suits your work, whether it\u2019s an ergonomically organised\nlaptop on a riser or a multi-screen command and control\ncentre.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253df1fa4ccaf222cb119f21889d80111ea4ac15/196_140_3932_2359/master/3932.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64f0e4afa53793765a75afb2ef42499b)\n\n[ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F253df1fa4ccaf222cb119f21889d80111ea4ac15%2F196_140_3932_2359%2F3932.jpg)\n[ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What%20do%20I%20need%20to%20work%20from%20home%20due%20to%20coronavirus%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3) [ Pinterest\n](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What%20do%20I%20need%20to%20work%20from%20home%20due%20to%20coronavirus%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2Faskjack%2F2020%2Fmar%2F19%2Fwork-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-\nisolating%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F253df1fa4ccaf222cb119f21889d80111ea4ac15%2F196_140_3932_2359%2F3932.jpg)\n\nIf you can set up a home office in a disused room then it\u2019s a lot easier to\nget a set up that suits your work, whether it\u2019s an ergonomically organised\nlaptop on a riser or a multi-screen command and control centre. Photograph:\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nMuch the best way to work at home is to set up a proper office in a spare\nbedroom, junk room, attic, conservatory, garden shed or David Cameron-style\n[shepherd\u2019s hut](https://www.redskyshepherdshuts.co.uk/blogs-\nnew/2019/2/28/3t2t88zy0h0krcnzdwtd2l47rlxq9i). If you have a family, your home\noffice should have a door with a \u201ckeep out\u201d or perhaps an [\u201con air\u201d\nsign](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/675328906601298385/). So many people are\nnow making podcasts, video conferencing or appearing on live TV from home\noffices that studio-style \u201con air\u201d signs \u2013 even neon ones \u2013 are becoming a\nthing. It helps avoid the spouse/partner and/or kids wandering in, to\n[humorous effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY).\n\nHaving dedicated office space means you can have a proper desk, an adjustable\noffice chair, one or more large monitors and a desktop PC that will deliver\nmore power than a laptop for less cost. You might even be tempted to buy a\nstanding desk or a \u201cdesk riser\u201d such as the [Yo Yo Desk 90](https://yo-\nyodesk.co.uk/products/yo-yo-desk-90) (British) or the [Varidesk Pro Plus\n36](https://www.vari.com/uk/en/sit-stand-converter-varidesk-pro-plus-36/DC-\nPP36.html). [Sit-Stand.com](https://sit-stand.com/) has these and many other\nmodels.\n\nFor more advice, see my recent answer: [How do I set up an ergonomic home\noffice?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/aug/01/how-do-i-\nset-up-an-ergonomic-home-office)\n\nThat answer didn\u2019t cover video conferencing, which will be important for many\npeople pushed out of their corporate nests. Even if it\u2019s not essential for\nmeetings, it\u2019s useful for quick video chats with colleagues. This fosters\ncamaraderie, especially if you start to feel lonely working on your own. It\u2019s\nalso easy to do, thanks to software such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams,\nGoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, TeamViewer and more.\n\nYou will look and sound a lot better if you buy a decent webcam with 1080p\n(Full HD) resolution. In previous answers, I\u2019ve recommended the [Logitech C920\nHD\nPro](http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FLogitech-C920-Pro-1080p-Webcam%2Fdp%2FB006A2Q81M%2F&sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-\nat-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating) webcam with microphone.

Photograph: Toby\nMelville/Reuters\n\nBroadband shouldn\u2019t be a problem because peak usage is in the evenings when\nmany people are streaming movies or TV or playing games such as Fortnite. Even\nif everyone starts video chatting, there is easily enough capacity for home\nworkers during the day. However, you should either have an unlimited business\nbroadband service, like me, or a cellular backup based on [a mobile router\nlike a Mifi](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/mobile-\nwifi-3656619/) or tethering a smartphone or whatever.\n\nEither way, your plan B should include an alternative device \u2013 a smartphone or\ntablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, or a spare laptop \u2013 and an alternative way\nof connecting to the office, even if it means using a hotspot while parked\noutside a local coffee shop. Sort out all the log-in and connection details\nand test it before you actually need it. You probably won\u2019t be able to do much\nwork without an internet connection.\n\n## **Top tip**\n\nAlmost every operating system supports multiple users, so set up a separate\naccount for work. Make this account look as much like your office PC as\npossible, with the same wallpaper and the same icons in much the same places.\nThat way, you won\u2019t be distracted by whatever games, social media or\nentertainment services you use when not working.\n\nUsing a separate account eliminates all your personal websites from your\nbrowsers and browser tabs. Having PornHub loaded is never a good look, even if\nyou don\u2019t accidentally switch to it.\n\n**Have you got a question?

She\nhas spent 14 of these years based in Asia (Beijing, Sydney, and Singapore).\nBefore her role as the APAC Managing Director for CCL, Elisa served as the\nMainland China Director and Head of Executive Development for a talent\ndevelopment firm, Management Development Services (MDS). Before MDS, Elisa\nspent over ten years at Accenture, working as a talent and organization\nconsultant for Accenture\u2019s New York, London, and Beijing offices. Elisa, who\nsplit time growing up between Miami, Florida, and Athens, Greece, has lived in\nmultiple countries in four continents and is passionate about leading with an\ninclusive and global mindset.\n\nElisa joined CCL in 2019 as the Managing Director and Vice President, Asia-\nPacific. In her role, she leads CCL\u2019s efforts in SE Asia, India, North Asia,\nand Australia to accelerate the leadership development and results of clients\nthroughout the region, from multi-national corporations and government\nagencies to domestic organizations, while also contributing significantly to\nCCL\u2019s global research agenda.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Elisa shares some insights on what it takes to\nsupport Asian leaders to break through the \u2018bamboo ceiling\u2019 and better support\norganizations that would like to be \u2018truly global\u2019. As Asia becomes the center\nof the world, what are the skill and mindsets that leaders must possess to\naccelerate success and create a positive impact not only in their own country\nand region but across the world.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the interview:\n\n### Your career trajectory is very extensive and interesting. When you look\nback, what are some of the key talent shifts/trends you have seen in the APAC\nregion in the last decade?\n\nOver the past 14 years living and working in Asia I\u2019ve witnessed an impressive\nincrease in leadership maturity. Globally we know we are in an increasingly\nRUPT (Rapid, Unpredictable, Paradoxical, Tangled) environment. In Asia, the\npace of that rapid change has been far more acute. There are many examples of\ntechnological advances in Asia that have skipped many steps that other markets\nhad to go through, leapfrogging ahead. At the start of my 10 years living in\nChina, I remember adjusting myself to a \u201ccash only\u201d approaches for many\npayments and transactions. By around 2016 the drastic transformation to a \u201cno\ncash at all\u201d way of life took within a year powered by WeChat and AliPay\nmobile payment systems, skipping many steps that other countries had to go\nthrough. Asian leaders driving and adapting to these types of transformations\nhave had to further develop and demonstrate high levels of agility and\nresilience along the way.\n\nAnother aspect of the significant increase in leadership maturity over the\nlast two decades in Asia comes with the increased movement, mobility, and\ndiversification that has taken place. Across China, India and SE Asia,\nincreasing numbers of Asian professionals have been relocating to different\ncities, gaining more regional exposure and experience. These leaders have\nbecome more culturally savvy and globally-minded.\n\nMoving forward Asian leaders aspiring for global careers need to further\ndevelop a level of comfort with disruption. They also need to step out of\ntheir comfort zone to develop global relationships and credibility with key\nstakeholders within and outside the organization.\n\n> While global organizations continue to look to Asia for growth, there is a\n> stark need for leaders who deeply understand the region to not only execute\n> a local growth strategy but also to have a strategic and influential point\n> of view within the top team on what it will really take to win in Asia\n\n### Can you tell us about some of the key highlights from CCL\u2019s Global Asian\nLeader report? What are some of the stark highlights that you have noticed\ncome out of the report? What traits do you see in the global Asian leader?\n\nWith Asia as the \u201cnew center of the world\u201d, Asian organizations and Asian\nleaders will be playing an even bigger role in defining some of these new\nsolutions and new economic models for success going forward. While global\norganizations continue to look to Asia for growth, there is a stark need for\nleaders who deeply understand the region to not only execute a local growth\nstrategy but also to have a strategic and influential point of view within the\ntop team on what it will really take to win in Asia. However, despite the\nacute need for \u2018Asia-fluent\u2019 leaders at the top, our research confirms a\nsignificant underrepresentation of Asian leaders in the top Executive Teams of\nEuropean and US multi-nationals. The Global Asian Leader research\nsystematically identifies the obstacles leaders face in their transition to\nglobal roles, and the roadblocks organizations need to overcome to build a\nrobust talent pipeline from Asia. One significant insight coming from the\nstudy is that while organizations facing a leadership crunch almost instantly\nstart evaluating capability gaps of Asian leaders, the root cause of\ninadequate global Asian leadership often resides elsewhere. Our Global Asian\nLeader research identifies multiple root-causes, including: the organizational\nroadblocks, roadblocks at the country level, as well as roadblocks coming from\nthe individual leader that include but are not limited to capability gaps.\nCountry-level infrastructure to equip talent with the skills that are needed\nand the unwillingness of the individual to go out and get more exposure\nthemselves are two common limiting factors.\n\nSo what is the common recipe for success when it comes to global and regional\nroles? Developed from the 120 interviews in the study, the global Asian leader\ncapability model provides a common recipe for success and the skills required,\nwhich include: Curiosity, Courage, Trust, Strategic Thinking, and Influencing.\nIt is about the ability of the leader to influence others who are people who\nare very different from him or herself and being able to do that across\nmultiple countries.\n\n### What are some of the similarities and differences that you have noticed\nacross the Asia Pacific when it comes to leadership skills?\n\nWhile there are significant and valuable differences in the culture and\naccepted practices of doing business across Asian countries, our research\nidentifies five common leadership traits of Asian Leaders.\n\n  * Collectivist approach \u2013 Asia scores low on individualism\n  * Focusing on harmony \u2013 Non-confrontational attitude at work\n  * Having a VUCA-ready attitude \u2013 Moving pieces make leaders very complexity-\u2018friendly\u2019\n  * Dependencies on networks and relationships \u2013 Friendships, family ties, or social strata\n  * Having a pervasive sense of hierarchy \u2013 Caring-autocrat attitude\n\nRecognizing, celebrating and championing these leadership traits is an\nimportant part of supporting Asian leaders to reach their full potential. At\nthe same time, we know that practices and behaviors that make leaders\nsuccessful in one country may, in fact, set them up for failure elsewhere.\nAsia is very diverse. Depending on the types of experience leaders have,\nregions they grow-up in, their ethnicity and other factors; they may look and\nbehave very differently. This Asian diversity is extremely valuable and is\nalso becoming more complex. Through the research interviews, we see that Asian\nleaders come in four different flavors.\n\n  * **Asian Returnee** \u2013 A leader of Asian origin who has educated and mainly worked outside of the region (often till mid-career)\n  * **Regional Champion** \u2013 A leader of Asian origin with multi-country and perhaps a multi-company work experience, but mainly within Asia\n  * **Global Nomad** \u2013 An Asian leader who has diverse multi-country experiences within and outside of Asia, often with the same organization\n  * **Local Expat \u2013** A leader who may not be of Asian origin, but has spent most of his or her working career within Asia\n\nInterestingly the Asian returnee and the local expat face similar levels of\nexperience when it comes to exposure to different cultures, strength of\nrelationships in headquarters and how embedded they are in the enterprise\nstrategy.\n\n> Better understanding Leadership Development through an Asian lens, in terms\n> of how it manifests today, is critical for future success of most global\n> organizations\n\n### In your current role, you are responsible for accelerating the leadership\ndevelopment and results of clients throughout the region while also\ncontributing significantly to CCL\u2019s global research agenda. Could you tell us\nmore about your focus areas?\n\nIn terms of our research, we are taking an \u201cEast to West\u201d approach in order to\nbetter understand leadership through an Asian lens. Over the last 50 years,\nthe study and practice of leadership development has been influenced mainly by\nacademic institutions and organizations in the Western world. Better\nunderstanding Leadership Development through an Asian lens, in terms of how it\nmanifests today, is critical for the future success of most global\norganizations.\n\nIn addition to the Global Asian Leader, we have recently completed the most\nextensive study done to date on Asian Boards of Directors (BOLD 3.0) and will\nsoon be launching a unique piece of Asian research focused on overcoming\nbarriers to Women\u2019s Leadership.\n\n> Inclusive leadership is becoming more and more important at a global level\n> for organizational and societal success. We need leaders who can rise above\n> differences and readily recognize our common humanity, especially in a\n> digital era\n\n### What are the key traits of inclusive leadership and what do they do\ndifferently? How do leaders become more inclusive?\n\nWhen my husband and I announced to all our family and friends in 2007 that we\nwere moving to Beijing, we heard two words repeatedly: difficult and\ndifferent. Of course, there were many difficulties and it was very different\nfrom London, where we lived at the time. What at first looked difficult,\nquickly became much easier thanks primarily to the people who helped us relate\nto, understand and come to love the many unsaid and important things about\nliving in China. Having the curiosity to see the world through their eyes and\nfeel and understand their reality was the driving force to form stronger and\ndeeper connections. The mentors and leaders in Asia who influenced and\nimpressed me the most over the last two decades have been leaders who have\ndemonstrated that curiosity and courage. Inclusive leadership is becoming more\nand more important at a global level for organizational and societal success.\nWe need leaders who can rise above differences and readily recognize our\ncommon humanity, especially in a digital era. We see technology outpacing what\npeople, organizations, and countries can keep up with. As we continue the\ndigital transformation journey, we need to make sure we are not leaving large\npockets of people behind. Inclusive leadership is the key and inclusive\nleadership also fosters developing the right understanding, products, and\nsolutions to win across many markets. The global Asian leaders who have the\nmaturity and self-awareness to relate to people from all walks of life will be\ninstrumental not only in solving for their region but also in solving for the\nworld.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [C-Suite](/category/leadership-\nstrategy/c-suite?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=c-suite \"Browse more in:\nC-Suite\"), [Leadership](/category/leadership-\nstrategy/leadership?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=leadership \"Browse\nmore in: Leadership\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Yasmin Taj](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1532607622/authors/yasmin-\ntaj.jpg)](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\n#### [Yasmin Taj](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\nYasmin Taj is working with People Matters as Senior Editor.

If you\u2019ve ever been on a conference call, you know how\nannoying background noise can be. Microsoft said Thursday that Microsoft Teams\nwill do something about it, part of a raft of new features the company will\nroll out over the course of the year.\n\nOf immediate importance to Teams users are four new features: real-time noise\nsuppression, a \u201craise hand\u201d feature, offline and low-bandwidth support\nfeatures, and the ability to \u201cpop out\u201d a chat into a separate window.\nMicrosoft said the chat feature is coming \u201csoon.\u201d\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/teams-on-realwear-\nmeeting-100835985-orig.jpg) [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/three-\nyears-of-Teams)\n\nMicrosoft Teams is now available to RealWear headsets.\n\n\u201cAs you know we\u2019re using Teams each day, and it\u2019s how I stay connected,\u201d said\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, in a prerecorded conversation\nshared with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to...stay focused on the documents you\u2019re\ncollaborating on, conduct these calls and meetings. I\u2019ve been living pretty\nmuch the last couple of weeks on Teams and chat.\u201d\n\n[[ Further reading: The best media streaming devices\n]](https://www.techhive.com/article/3187462/streaming-hardware/best-media-\nstreaming-device.html)\n\nThis week, Microsoft celebrates the third birthday of Microsoft Teams, an\napplication that has taken greater prominence as the coronavirus pandemic\nworsens. Microsoft currently has 44 million people around the world using\nTeams, including 93 of the top Fortune 100 companies. Teams competes with\nSlack and to some extent with Zoom, as well as the office suite and\ncollaborative tools offered by Zoho. On Wednesday, [Slack announced its own\nupgrade](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3533051/slack-reworks-its-interface-\nto-reorganize-the-sidebar-and-emphasize-apps.html), a UI facelift that\nemphasizes configurability and a new \u201clightning bolt\u201d icon designed to serve\nas a gateway to connected apps.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/microsoft-teams-raise-\nhand-100835995-orig.jpg) Mark Hachman / IDG / Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has added a tiny \"raise hand\" icon to Teams.\n\nThere\u2019s less of an overarching theme connecting the new Teams features, though\nthere\u2019s some connection to existing features. Take Teams\u2019 newfound ability to\nweed out distracting background noises: In an online demonstration, Microsoft\nshowed off how Teams was able to filter out the noise of a meeting participant\ncrinkling a bag of chips. Likewise, Teams can already blur a meeting\nbackground or intelligently add its own custom scenery to avoid distractions.\n\nMicrosoft Teams is adding a \u201craise hand\u201d feature to let people in multi-person\nmeetings alert others that they have a question or are prepared to speak.\nUnfortunately, the hand-raising icon is rather small and inconspicuous, at\nleast in the images that Microsoft let us see.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/pop-out-chat-in-\nteams-100835984-orig.jpg) [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/three-years-\nof-Teams)\n\nChats will now be able to be popped out into their own separate window.\n\nMicrosoft also has a couple of new chat-specific features to add to Teams. The\nability to separate a chat into its own window, known as \u201cpopping it out,\u201d is\nsomething you can already do in the Windows 10 Mail app, for example, to\nseparate an email reply or composition into its own window. A related chat\nfeature is designed to be used in conditions that hopefully no one has to face\nduring the COVID-19 crisis: the need to chat or communicate with a low-\nbandwidth or completely absent Internet connection. Microsoft didn\u2019t show us\nthis feature in action, but it would presumably be similar to the way in which\nOutlook allows for offline message composition.\n\nMicrosoft offered some options specific to particular verticals, including the\non-the-spot employees known as \u201cfirstline workers.\u201d Microsoft is adding\nsupport for Teams on RealWear headsets, a sort of collaborative visor where\nmaintenance employees can videoconference with support staff who can see what\nthey\u2019re looking at. Likewise, Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365 Business\nVoice, a voice-first Teams system for small businesses.\n\n_This story was updated at 8:57 AM with additional images, and again at 9:11\nAM with additional information about the number of Teams users, and at 10:05\nwith an additional image._\n\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may\nearn a small commission.

In this\ncontext, building a strong foundation from an early age is important. \"There\nare 4,000+ STEM centres across India but the quality of education is limited\nby the technical skill of the trainer,\" say Sneha Priya and S Pranavan, the\nfounders of edutainment company [SP Robotic\nWorks](https://sproboticworks.com/), which empowers young school students by\nintroducing them to technologies like Virtual Reality, robots and drones in a\nfun and experiential way.\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/18d4ab20-d081-11e9-9775-a119527191d8/1574335769398.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nFounded in 2016, SP Robotic had built a partner portal with their in-house IT\nteam to help them scale the centres quickly. But they had several requirements\nthat needed a scalable software to handle internal tasks, as well as support\nwith integrating their website with the partner portal. That's when they came\nacross the \"[Zoho for Startups](https://www.zoho.com/one/startups/)\"\ninitiative that offered them [Zoho One](https://www.zoho.com/one/). Zoho One\nis the entire suite of over 45 apps that enables end-to-end management of a\nbusiness. \"We were a DIPP registered startup with Startup India and Zoho One\nwas available for us at the right time,\" says Sneha.\n\n  \n\nOn how Zoho One has enabled their internal processes, she says, \"Being a\nhardware and software company with sales and support teams, we needed\ncompletely different management systems for each of our teams. We were\nthrilled to have one software which the entire team could use.\"\n\n  \n\nEarlier, they maintained excel sheets, where the credibility of the data and\nimproper movement between stages made analysis difficult. Today, [Zoho\nCRM](https://www.zoho.com/in/crm/) enables them to analyse the timeline, from\nidentifying leads to conversion, which has increased the team's performance.\n\n  \n\nAlso, they were using an inventory management system which was completely de-\nlinked from their billing and ordering system, which created problems each\ntime an order was placed. Zoho's API got the job done by keeping a proper\ntrack of the inventory and its value across different stages of production. SP\nRobotic uses [Zoho People](https://www.zoho.com/people/) and [Zoho\nRecruit](https://www.zoho.com/recruit/) for HR requirements, [Zoho\nConnect](https://www.zoho.com/connect/) for internal task management, and\n[Zoho PageSense](https://www.zoho.com/pagesense/) for tracking activity on\ntheir website. The support team uses [Zoho Desk](https://www.zoho.com/desk/)\nto manage all the support provided to their customers via call and email. They\nalso plan to use [Zoho Books](https://www.zoho.com/books/), [Zoho\nInventory](https://www.zoho.com/in/inventory/) and [Zoho\nExpense](https://www.zoho.com/expense/) in the foreseeable future.\n\n  \n\nGoing forward, SP Robotics is planning to expand rapidly in other Asia-Pacific\ncountries and the Middle East. For the company, it is critical to ensure that\nthat their internal tasks are efficiently managed as they scale, and there's\nno better partner than Zoho One to fulfill that requirement. \"The best part is\nthe flexibility in each software - you can add as many fields, configure the\nwhole operations, and automate the entire process. This has helped our IT team\nintegrate the Zoho system with our own system and increase efficiency,\"\nsummarises Sneha.\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

There is, of course, a method to\ntheir madness. The cost to them will be more than offset by the goodwill (and\npossible future business) generated, so it's a win/win situation. And if\nyou've ever wanted to check out new-to-you products without having to spend a\nlot of money, it's ideal.\n\nGary Barton, principal analyst for collaboration services at GlobalData, noted\nthat the key applications will be collaboration/unified communications\nplatforms that include team messaging, IP voice calling, conferencing (audio,\nvideo, and web), shared documents and storage, and project management\nfeatures.\n\n\n\n####  **For more stories about COVID-19 's impact on supply chains, or how to\nsecure your remote devices, click [here](https://www.itbusiness.ca/covid-19)**\n\n\n\n\"Most companies will probably adopt a mixture of platforms \u2013 e.g., using one\nplatform for team collaboration, another for conferencing, and application\nsuites such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite,\" he said. \"Desktop-as-\na-Service solutions combined with VPN (virtual private network) connections\nover home broadband also offer another way for companies to enable workers to\nlog on at home as if they were in a corporate office.\"\n\nA lot of individuals and companies are diving into the WFH lifestyle. Cisco\nchairman and chief executive officer Chuck Robbins [told\nCNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/cisco-ceo-says-5point5-billion-minutes-\nof-webex-meetings-due-to-coronavirus.html) that in the first eleven days of\nMarch, Cisco Webex volume has doubled. It hosted 5.5 billion meeting minutes,\nand in one day held 3.2 million multi-person meetings globally, plus many more\none-on-one discussions. Robbins said that the company has teams working 24\u00d77\nmaking sure its infrastructure can cope.\n\nBarton said that COVID-19 is accelerating the evolution of remote work.\n\n\"The general trend in the work environment has been towards more flexible\nworking for some time now, so COVID-19 is creating accelerated evolution\nrather than a left-field revolution. Many companies already use collaboration\ntools and many employees also hot-desk and/or work from home one day a week. I\nthink that COVID-19 will have long-lasting effects on the way we work, though.\nI think the situation we are in now will mean that people become more used to\nremote working \u2013 and it will also (hopefully!) demonstrate that it is possible\nto work from home and be efficient. This could have long term benefits for\npeople\u2019s work/life balance and for the environment if people commute less in\nthe future.\"\n\nWe've compiled a selection of collaboration products that could help companies\nweather the COVID-19 storm, highlighting any special offers or free access. Do\nyou have a favourite not mentioned here? Please let us know in the comments.\n\n####  **Cisco Webex Teams**\n\nPeople often think of Webex as just conferencing, but Cisco uses it as the\noverarching brand for all of its collaboration products, including [Cisco\nWebex Teams](https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html) (yes, confusing,\nsince Microsoft's equivalent product is also called Teams), which integrates\nchat, meetings, whiteboard, scheduling, and file management, and integrates\nwith popular productivity software like Microsoft Office.

Additionally, said David Robertson,\nmanaging director and president of sales at Avaya Canada, Avaya has already\nenabled over 160,000 agents in call centres to work remotely.\n\n####  **Google Hangouts**\n\nGoogle's contribution to the need for connectivity is [Google\nHangouts](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/). Although the consumer\nversion has none of the enterprise features many companies require, G Suite\ncustomers globally [get free\naccess](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/helping-businesses-and-\nschools-stay-connected-in-response-to-coronavirus) to advanced Hangouts Meet\nvideoconferencing features until July 1, 2020, including meetings of up to 250\nparticipants per call, live streaming for up to 100,000 viewers within a\ndomain, and the ability to record meetings.\n\n####  **Zoom**\n\n[Zoom](https://zoom.us/pricing) video conferencing has a free tier that lets\nusers host up to 100 participants in an unlimited number of group meetings of\nup to 40 minutes.

(See some announcements at the\nbottom of this post on that.)\n\nI'm also watching the news until what seems to be the relentless grimness of\nit all is too much and then I just blitz out and watch some of my favorite\nshows (happy to let you know what they are if you ask) so that I can escape.\nBut, yesterday, an old friend of mine, [Gene\nMorphis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gene-morphis-4661a8/), who is the former\nCFO of David's Bridal (that's how I met him) put out a post on Facebook that\nwas just an aggregation of positive news and I decided to take that and run\nwith it here \u2013 and also to add quite a bit so that you can see that this\npandemic will end and we will emerge \u2013 I don't want to say better for it or\nnot \u2013 I don't know that beyond just my normally optimistic view of the world \u2013\nbut we will emerge able to deal with this and at least hopefully in a better\nplace than we came into this crisis.

They donated $3 million to UCSF COVID-19 Response Fund, The CDC Foundation's Emergency Response Fund and San Francisco's Give2SF Fund. They have created emergency response applications for healthcare systems, philanthropies small businesses, employees and customers under the umbrella name of Salesforce Cares \u2013 which for now are free ([See this post by my dear friend and EVP of CRM for Salesforce, Bill Patterson](https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/stories/2020/3/salesforce-care/)). They have promised no significant layoffs in the next 90 days to alleviate the fears of their now working at home employees and have engaged Jack Kornfeld and the Plumtree Monks among others to support those employees who are experiencing anxiety \u2013 a number they report at 36 percent. Additionally, they've created an [AppExchange COVID-19 Resource Center](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/mktcollections/curated/c19response?utm_source=salesforce.com&utm_medium=salesforce.com) for their partner ecosystem to contribute to the unprecedented technological needs of the global population. \n  2. [ServiceNow, expert in the world of service ops have released four apps focused around emergency response management free of charge until September 30](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-emergency-response-apps.html). [They are available here](https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/crisis-management.html). Their partner ecosystem isn't sitting back either. A well known partner 3CLogic is providing their existing customers with a free 50 percent more seats and for new customers guaranteeing rapid response deployment in no more than 2 weeks so there is no loss of operations.   \n\n  3. [Zoho, very early on, when they realized the level of threat that we were facing, created Zoho Remotely \u2013 an 11 product toolkit and solution for working at home remotely which they were giving away free until June 30](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/blog/remote-work-tool.html). Zoho, serving a huge community of small businesses globally who are threatened with their very existence by this crisis, have responded as they always do \u2013 with compassion.\n  4. [SAP has focused on the work at home and logistics/supply chain disruption and has been giving away free of charge for now a broad number of their applications tailored specifically to deal with this crisis](https://news.sap.com/2020/03/sap-addresses-covid-19-supply-chain-business-travel-disruption/). They range from SAP Litmos to Qualtrics Work Pulse to six months free of TripIt Pro. For a complete list check the link above.\n  5. [Microsoft paying their hourly workers full wages even when their hours are reduced](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/microsoft-will-pay-hourly-workers-regular-wages-even-if-their-hours-are-reduced-because-of-covid-19-concerns/). This was followed by Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter and Expedia doing the same thing. [Microsoft is also giving whoever wants it a six month premium Teams subscription so that they can work remotely and collaborate. ](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/coronavirus-microsoft-teams-google-hangouts-meet-free)Also, as of March 10, the free version lifted the limits of the numbers of users and allow all users to schedule video conferences and calls. \n  6. [Oracle is providing its second generation public cloud infrastructure to research agencies who need computing power to handle a huge volume of data at high speeds](https://cloudwars.co/oracle-battles-covid-19-gives-researchers-gen-2-cloud-infrastructure/). A smaller but valuable give to support the anti-viral wars, [they are giving the Workforce Health and Safety solution to all their Human Capital Management (HCM) subscribers](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/blog/oracle-workforce-health-and-safety-033120.html). (Aside: I wish the human relations profession would stop calling it Human Capital Management \u2013 worst name for something involving people EVER). \n  7. [Smart ring company Oura is setting up a study for 2000 frontline UCSF health care workers to see if they can develop the algorithms for early detection of the coronavirus](https://www.cnet.com/news/how-a-smart-ring-may-detect-early-covid-19-symptoms/).   \n\n## Crisis \u2013 Useful Knowledge\n\n  1. [\"How to understand \u2013 and report \u2013 figures for 'COVID \"Deaths'\" by Dr. John Lee.](https://spectator.us/understand-report-figures-covid-deaths/?fbclid=IwAR0UtbLaYW-S2sGfgkGg53O9Ajjr45Yrdz4-i7epvcab6b4vgSSIgXi-274) Here is an article that helps you get the context and the meaning of the reports of the COVID-19 deaths \u2013 from a recently retired prominent pathologist. It's not happy but it is clearheaded and gives you some real context. It brought me an odd sense of peace. \n  2. [Read this article by thought leader Denis Pombriant on anti-serum use](https://medium.com/@DenisPombriant/lets-make-an-antiserum-for-corona-virus-bb1a96dc5808) \u2013 e.g. blood plasmas with antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients. \n  3. Of course, for the most reliable information follow the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/index.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). \n  4. One app available on the iPhone and Android (Google Play) is [News Break](http://www.newsbreakapp.com/) which is doing a great job of tracking the Coronavirus news globally and locally. I heartily recommend using it.\n  5. Another one which is even more well known is [NextDoor](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/How-to-join-Nextdoor?language=en_US) to be alert to what is going on in your city and county. This is less geared to news channels and more geared to community interaction. Well worth downloading and installing and joining. \n\n## Crisis \u2013 The Best PSA EVER!! Make Sure You Watch\n\nI figured that what you will see here \u2013 Larry David's PSA \u2013 might be the best\nPSA of any kind I ever saw. If you have a CLUE about Larry David \u2013 and if you\ndon't you live under a rock or were actually born under it and never left your\nbirth home \u2013 you will totally love this. And even though it was for\nCalifornia, what he says applies to EVERYONE.\n\n> \u201cYou\u2019re hurting old people like me. Well, not me... I\u2019ll never see you.\u201d  \n>  \n> Larry David wants everyone to stay home to protect older Californians from\n> [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!  \n> He does not do these things.  \n> Listen to\n> Larry.[#StayHomeSaveLives](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayHomeSaveLives?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)<https://t.co/snYe5v55Rw>\n> [pic.twitter.com/C5cKOaAufE](https://t.co/C5cKOaAufE)\n>\n> \u2014 Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) [March 31,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1245110728199045120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Now a couple of CRM Playaz Announcements:\n\n  1. Expect to see us every Thursday at 3:00pm Eastern Time broadcast onto at least LinkedIn and Twitter and likely 3 other channels. Watch here, and Small Business Trends and Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn for announcements on the what. The when is set.\n  2. We all miss \u2013 well most of us \u2013 miss sports. So, to fill that gap, Brent and I are adding a CRM Playaz Sports Edition \u2013 Excuse the Intrusion (LOL!!) every Friday at 3pm Eastern Time. \n  3. Finally, there will be a CRM Playaz happy hour that will begin next week \u2013 and this is come one, come all. There will be an Eventbrite invite posted on various social media and the first 15 or so who respond will be on the Zoom-enabled Happy Hour that week. The next 15 will be on the waiting list for the next week etc. If we are as popular as we'd like to think we are, it probably will be a coveted event \u2013 like an Amazon/Whole Foods delivery window. Watch for the invite this week. The only price of admission is that you have to be holding a quaffable dram of liquid \u2013 doesn't have to be alcohol \u2013 in your hand for entry. So a bottle of lens cleaner doesn't count. You will be asked what you are drinking at the happy hour. This happy hour is the great equalizer. There is no status that counts for any more than anyone else's. CEO to unemployed \u2013 all the same. Its just a bunch of us getting together and shooting the breeze. One unique feature? Or at least interesting one. If you want to talk to one or two people somewhere other than in general or about a different subject, then we will create a breakout room for you so you can have a private conversation. Also, employers feel free to come and hire. Unemployed feel free to come and mingle and see what's there. We are cool with whatever. Again, HAPPY hour. Not just hour. \n\nStay safe, indoors, healthy, and stock up.\n\nSee y'all soon.\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ After Hours ](/topic/after-hours/) [ CXO ](/topic/cxo/) [ Government\n](/topic/government/) [ Security ](/topic/security/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Paul\nGreenberg](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/22/5d27c9c9-1175-11e4-9732-00505685119a/thumbnail/40x40/dbe9066e7c786b056950a90c8164699f/paul-\ngreenberg.jpg) ](/meet-the-team/us/paul-greenberg/)\n\nBy [ Paul Greenberg ](/meet-the-team/us/paul-greenberg/) for [Social CRM: The\nConversation](/blog/crm/) | April 2, 2020 -- 12:28 GMT (20:28 GMT+08:00) |\nTopic: [Coronavirus: Business and technology in a\npandemic](/topic/coronavirus-business-and-technology-in-a-pandemic/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

So\nmuch so that _AdWeek_ touted it as the \"King of the Quarantine Economy\". And,\nrightly so.\n\n  \n\nSince the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has forcibly confined people to\ntheir homes, the [remote-working and video conferencing platform has witnessed\nan unprecedented surge](https://yourstory.com/2020/03/zoom-us-eric-yuan-\ncoronavirus-video-conferencing-remote-working) in valuation and users. In\nfact, it has clocked more monthly active users in Q1 of 2020 than it did in\nall of last year.\n\n  \n\nZoom's **stock has more than doubled** in the last three months, and it is now\nmore valuable than Silicon Valley upstarts Uber and Lyft combined. The\nstartup's **billionaire-founder Eric Yuan has added $4.7 billion to his\nfortune** this year, and his wealth now stands at $8.26 billion, according to\nthe _Bloomberg Billionaires Index_.\n\n  \n\n> Experts believe that Zoom's freemium pricing model was tailor-made for the\n> coronavirus-induced remote-working universe. That, in fact, allowed the\n> video-conferencing platform to come out of its enterprise bubble and reach\n> the common man (or individual users).\n\n  \n\n![Eric Yuan,\nZoom](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/730b50702d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/Imagemqwv-1584526328422.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nEric Yuan.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/dc9aa1302d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/WFH-01-1585024154808.png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Coronavirus: Remote working ain't a cakewalk, but here are some dos and\ndon'ts\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-working-dos-donts-work-\nhome-tips)\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nHowever, Zoom continues to be limiting in some ways, especially with its\n**40-minute remote meeting cap** on basic plans. Even though the platform has\nremoved that limit for schools and universities to enable seamless virtual\nlearning, other users have to shell out at least $14.99 per month for a Zoom\nPro plan.\n\n  \n\nIf you're a large organisation that needs to have 300 or 500 participants on a\nvideo conference, you pay even more - **$19.99 per month and beyond**.\n\n  \n\n> Further, if you want to book a Zoom Room, a dedicated virtual conference\n> room, the rates **go up to $49 per month** , thus reducing the feasibility\n> of the platform for many businesses.\n\n  \n\nBut, there are several **alternative remote working** and **real-time\ncollaboration tools**. _YourStory_ draws up a list of the five most\ninteresting ones.\n\n## Amazon Chime\n\nAmazon is a cloud computing giant, but its workplace communication software\nChime might be less publicised compared to some of its other products.\n\n  \n\nAmazon Chime lets you **meet, chat, and place business calls** within and\noutside your organisation through a single interface.\n\n  \n\n![Amazon\nChime](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/dc9aa1302d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/AmazonChime1-1585055409226.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nNot only this, but even developers can use the same communication\ninfrastructure to add **audio calling, video calling, and screen sharing\nfeatures** to their applications using the Amazon Chime SDK.\n\n  \n\n> The most attractive element of Amazon Chime is that it has a pay-per-use\n> pricing model that lets you pay for only the features you use, on the days\n> that you use them. There are no upfront investments or long-term contracts.\n> You can switch between Basic and Pro features.\n\n  \n\nLarge enterprises can use the **Amazon Chime Voice Connector** to **migrate\ntheir telephony workloads to AWS**.

People are anxious and\ntaking control of life in any way they can, which may include buying a\nlifetime supply of toilet paper or enough hand sanitizer to fill a swimming\npool.\n\nMost everyone knows the choice to hoard supplies is not rational, but they\nstill can't stop themselves from adding one more case of Kleenex to the cart\n\"just in case.\" Why? Because human are wired to react this way in an unknown\ncrisis.\n\nHere are a couple of the brain concepts at play and tips for communicating\nwith staff during troubling times.\n\n## Proactively communicate as often as possible.\n\nThings always seem more important when we are thinking about them, due to the\n[focusing effect](http://awmueller.com/psicoterapia-\nindividual/kahneman_would_you_happier.pdf). Everyone is thinking about\ncoronavirus constantly, and as long as they are forced to keep those thoughts\nwithin their own minds productivity will be impaccted. When people have an\nopportunity to discuss their fears in a safe place (and some of those fears\nare mitigated) it can help them move on for a while and get work done.\n\nThe \"what ifs\" are running rampant right now, so proactively answer as many of\nthose questions as you can to keep employees calm. Use these to create FAQs\nand the content for the proactive conversations suggested above:\n\n  * What if my family or I get sick and have to be quarantined? Will my job be safe?\n  * Where would I go to get tested if I think I have coronavirus?\n  * What if my kid's school is closed and I need to stay home with them?\n\nConsider all the fears your employees may be having, and proactively talk\nabout them to help calm fears. If you don't have policies in place yet,\ncommunicate now to say it is being worked on and send updates as you have\nthem. It may feel like overcommunication, but with all the focus on this, it\nwill feel like ages between updates.\n\n## Balance the messages about coronavirus.\n\nLook for opportunities to help employees' brains be less likely to have fear\nand overreaction be their instinctual responses. There is a lot going on with\nnew changes daily, but panic will not help the situation improve.\n\nActively start looking for positive stories \\-- or at least fact-based content\nthat is neutral -- and share that with your team to balance out the messages\nthey are hearing.\n\n## Give them something productive to focus on.\n\nWith reduced travel (more time and money) consider what your employees could\nbe doing to move your company forward. People will jump at an opportunity to\nfeel in control of something, and that distraction could be a huge value to\nyour business. Put together a challenge or encourage time to be spent on\ncreative projects by asking questions like:\n\n  * How could we best spend the $100,000 from the travel budget?\n  * What products/services could we offer to be of service during coronavirus?\n  * How could being remote for six months actually help our company thrive?\n\nCommunicating during coronavirus is important, and hopefully these tips will\nhelp your employees feel safe and supported, while also allowing your company\nto come out stronger on the other side.\n\nPublished on: Mar 24, 2020\n\nLike this column?

And it's one that builds customer and employee loyalty. Deloitte\nlast year found purpose-oriented companies have higher productivity and growth\nrates, along with a more satisfied workforce who stay longer with them. The\nresearch shows such companies report 30 per cent higher levels of innovation\nand 40 per cent higher levels of workforce retention than their competitors.\n\n[Deloitte ](https://www.cmo.com.au/tag/deloitte/)also found more than 80 per\ncent of consumers would be willing to pay more if a brand raised its prices to\nbe more environmentally and socially responsible or to pay higher wages to its\nemployees. Out of these respondents, 15 per cent said they would be willing to\npay over 25 per cent more for a brand\u2019s items.\n\nWith the world awash with terrible news right now, _CMO_ is highlighting\nefforts being made by a selection of brands in the current COVID-19 crisis to\nsupport customers and businesses through unprecedented disruption.  \n\n#### Trip.com\n\nTrip.com Group, an online travel services provider, is kicking off a global\ninitiative for the donation of one million surgical masks to support the fight\nagainst the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/435x435/dimg/trip.jpg)Credit:\nTrip.com\n\nLed by the company's co-founder and chairman of the board, James Liang, the\ninitiative has seen the delivery and allocation of surgical mask supplies to\nvarious countries, including Italy, Korea, Japan, the US, Canada, Germany,\nSerbia, France, UK, and Australia.  \n\nLiang says the company hopes that the donation will play a role in bringing\ncountries together in a collective effort to contain the virus.\n\n\"It is crucial at this moment in the global fight against the epidemic all\ncountries come together and support each other, to secure a victory for\nhumanity,\" he said.\n\nThe move to donate masks is the latest in a series of actions taken by the\nonline travel services provider to minimise impact, and beat the epidemic.\n\nIn late January, the company responded to the initial outbreak in China by\nextending cancellation provisions for customers affected by travel bans and\nmedical conditions. The company also led a Safeguard Cancellation Guarantee\nindustry initiative, which brought together hotels and airlines to ensure that\nits 400 million users worldwide have peace of mind in booking with Trip.com\nGroup platforms.\n\n#### Coles\n\n[Coles](https://www.cmo.com.au/tag/coles/) will donate extra food and\ngroceries to the retail value of $1 million a week to help Australians who are\nfacing hardship as a result of the Coronavirus.\n\n![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/435x435/dimg/coles_sign_dreamstime_800by500.jpg)Credit:\nDreamstime\n\nThe food donations will be directed to food relief organisations, Foodbank and\nSecondBite, which will in turn distribute the food to up to 3800 community\nfood programs across Australia.  \n\nColes Group CEO Steven Cain said the decision to increase Coles\u2019 food\ndonations was in response to increasing demand for food relief from vulnerable\nAustralians.\n\n\u201cFor many years, we have donated surplus edible food from our supermarkets and\ndistribution centres but sadly we are hearing that an increasing number of\npeople in our community are facing particularly tough times as a flow-on\neffect of the Coronavirus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by donating an additional $1 million in food each week to\nSecondBite and Foodbank, we can help get food and essentials to people who are\nespecially vulnerable at this unprecedented time.\u201d\n\nSecondBite CEO, Jim Mullan, welcomed the additional food donations. \u201cA key\nissue for us at the moment is keeping up with the growing demand. Coles\ncurrently donates surplus food from around 780 supermarkets and these\nadditional donations from its distribution centres will help us to reach an\nincreasing number of people in need,\u201d he said.\n\n#### The Big Four Banks\n\nAustralia's big four banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and National\nAustralia Bank - have all debuted significant relief package for COVID-19\nimpacted small businesses.\n\nBanks will defer loan repayments for small businesses affected by COVID-19 for\nsix months. Banks are also promising to fast-track the approval process to\nensure small businesses get the support they need as soon as possible.\n\n[![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/120x120/dimg/remote_workers_larger_talent_pool-100577208-orig.jpg)](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/672072/report-\nmost-australian-employees-work-from-home/) **Read more** [Report: Most\nAustralian employees to work from\nhome](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/672072/report-most-australian-employees-\nwork-from-home/)\n\nThe assistance packages will apply to more than $100 billion of existing small\nbusiness loans and put up to $8 billion back into the hands of small\nbusinesses.\n\n#### Zoho\n\nZoho Corporation, a global company offering a suite of business software\napplications, launched its Small Business Emergency Subscription Assistance\nProgram (ESAP) to help Zoho customers worldwide weather the global crisis.\n\nFor up to 20,000 qualified paying customers with 25 employees or less, Zoho is\nwaiving the cost of every application they currently use, for up to three\nmonths.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are hurting. They already face tremendous pressure on revenue and\ncash flows. Not knowing when things will get back to normal is even worse,\"\nZoho co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Vembu, said.\n\n\u201cEvery bit of help we, and other companies, can offer to keep these small\nbusinesses afloat will go a long way, not just financially but emotionally as\nwell. We are in this together, and contributions from every business help our\ncommunity get through this pandemic.\n\n\u201cCertain industries have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, and\nwe strongly encourage our customers in these industries to please apply for\nthis Small Business Emergency Subscription Assistance Program.\n\n\u201cWhile we want to provide relief for as many small business customers as\npossible, we will prioritize those who are most in need and hope that others\nwho are adapting to market conditions will help us by allowing program\navailability to those struggling to stay afloat.\u201d\n\n#### DoorDash\n\n[DoorDash](https://www.cmo.com.au/tag/door-dash/) has introduced a number of\nmeasures to help people enjoy their favourite food safely, help local\nrestaurants gain access to more customers, and provide assistance to Dashers\n(drivers).\n\n![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/435x435/dimg/doordash_sydney_launch_2.jpg)Credit:\nDoorDash\n\n[![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/120x120/dimg/dreamstime_xxl_68441430_digital-\nconference_resized.jpg)](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/672004/can-virtual-\nevents-fill-digital-conference-gap/) **Read more** [Can virtual events fill\nthe physical conference gap?](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/672004/can-\nvirtual-events-fill-digital-conference-gap/)\n\nAll delivery fees have been waived. DoorDash is removing delivery fees on\norders from restaurant partners to offer more selection to customers and help\nrestaurants generate higher sales.  \n\nDoorDash is waiving commission fees on all pickup orders placed through its\nplatform. This is another way for restaurants to serve customers who are on\nfoot or wanting to spend less time in a restaurant. DoorDash is also offering\nnew restaurants the opportunity to sign up with DoorDash for free and pay zero\ncommissions for 30 days.\n\nDeliveries are moving to no-contact by default, and DoorDash is providing\nfinancial assistance to Dashers who are sick. It is also in the process of\nshipping more than 1 million sets of free hand sanitiser to Dashers in all\nmarkets it operates.\n\n\u201cAt DoorDash we\u2019re actively working to ensure the safety of customers and\nDashers while supporting the local businesses who are at the centre of the\ncommunities we serve. In the face of uncertainty, restaurants are having to\nadjust how they operate which is why we have introduced initiatives to promote\nthe health and safety of our users while supporting these businesses. DoorDash\nis proud to help local Australian business serve our shared communities\nthrough this most challenging time, \u201d general manager of DoorDash Australia,\nThomas Stephens, asid.\n\n#### Appian\n\nAppian has created a free COVID-19 Response Management application for\nenterprises and government agencies. The application can be fully configured\nand adopted within two hours.\n\n![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/435x435/dimg/appian.png)Credit:\nAppian\n\nThe app establishes a central command centre to safeguard the health and\nsafety of employees. It tracks health status, location, travel history and any\nCOVID-19 incident details.  \n\nEmployers can see the health and work status of all employees, by geography\nand department. The application runs in Appian\u2019s HIPAA-certified Cloud. The\napp also enables organisations to offer community support to their employees.\n\n\u201cAt Appian, we believe workplaces are more than simply jobs, they are\ncommunities, and they should rally together in challenging times. For our own\ninternal use, we have created and automated a \u201cCOVID-19 Help Department\u201d to\nconnect employee volunteers with employees who need assistance. Appian has\nscores of volunteers rallied to help employees in need \u2014 delivering groceries,\noffering a ride, helping at home, or making virtual social connections. In the\napplication we announce today, we bring the same functionality to any\norganisation that wishes to deploy it,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nOrganisations implementing the application are given access to Appian\u2019s\nCOVID-19 Application Desk for assistance.\n\n[![](https://d1902livswy8rb.cloudfront.net/dimg/120x120/dimg/virtual_reality.jpg)](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/671966/virtual-\nsuccess/) **Read more** [How to achieve virtual experience\nsuccess](https://www.cmo.com.au/article/671966/virtual-success/)\n\n#### Telcos dish up data\n\nTelstra, Optus, Vodafone and Amaysim are all offering customers additional\nmobile data to stay connected during this challenging and uncertain time.\n\nAmaysim customers, for example, on a $10 mobile plan will receive 10GB of\nadditional data, $20 mobile plan customers will receive 20GB of additional\ndata, and $30 mobile plan customers will receive 30GB of additional data.

You've got to do a few\nthings before your Zoom meeting is secure. You'll need to make sure you're not\ndownloading a malicious bit of software. You need to make sure you're not\nsharing your room name. You've got to tap a few buttons and follow a few rules\n- and it CAN BE relatively easy to make certain you're entirely safe from\nnegative elements like \"zoombombing\" or \"zoom-bombing\".\n\nMalicious parties are using the popularity of Zoom to target people who might\nnot normally use video chat software\u2026 or any other software, for that matter.\nThey're targeting your co-workers, friends, and relatives that you wouldn't be\nsurprised to hear say \"I'm not good with technology.\"\n\nThey've created malware that poses as official Zoom software. They've crafted\nemails with links to webpages that look like Zoom's official webpage. They've\nfound ways to drop in on Zoom chats without being invited. All of this SHOULD\nbe easy to avoid.\n\n## FBI warning\n\nYes, there was an FBI warning about Zoom. Per our [report from earlier\ntoday](https://www.slashgear.com/zoom-becomes-a-household-name-and-thats-a-\nproblem-01615114/), the FBI issued a warning for potential Zoom users. This\nwarning let it be known that Zoom is not particularly secure by default. Much\nof what they suggested for security is included below.\n\n## The right apps\n\nDo NOT download any ZOOM apps from any 3rd-party sources. The webpage where\nyou'll find all the official apps is\n[Zoom.US/download](https://zoom.us/download). That's the official Zoom\nhomepage, where they list links to the apps they've made.\n\nDo not download any Zoom app from an email, do not load Zoom from any source\nother than the Google Play app store (linked via Zoom, above), the Apple app\nstore (linked via Zoom, above), or if you're on a desktop machine - straight\nthrough the browser, or with the apps provided by the link above.\n\n## You're being recorded\n\n**ALSO NOTE:** If you're in a Zoom meeting, you could be being recorded. In\nthe upper left-hand corner of your Zoom chat window, there'll be an indicator\nthat'll let you know. Any user can download all chat logs from the meeting as\nthey're exiting the meeting - that includes only the text they'd have\notherwise been able to see during the meeting.\n\n## Use a password\n\nWhen you create a Zoom room, set it so it requires that participants enter a\npassword. Do not create a Zoom room that does not require a password. The\ngeneration of Zoom room names is such that a random individual can potentially\nenter if a password is not set. You can avoid random drop-ins by setting a\npassword for the room.\n\n![](https://scdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/meetingae.jpg)\n\nAbove you'll see the settings you'll want to roll with if you're initiating a\nmeeting. If you're the host, you'll want to select your own meeting name -\nselect the number - and set a password. These elements are super simple to\nedit, and essential to ramp up security.\n\n## Disallow sharing by participants\n\nSee the settings listed below - you're going to want to make sure you're\ndisallowing wild sharing by random participants. This should further act to\nstop Zoombombing - if all other measures fail.\n\n![](https://scdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/notwhat.jpg)\n\n## Do not share in public\n\nDo not share screenshots of your Zoom chatroom. These screenshots can contain\ninformation that'll allow malicious parties to enter the room without your\nauthorization. This can also be mitigated by setting a password for the room -\nbut still, do not share screenshots of your Zoom room.\n\nAlso avoid sharing the name of your Zoom room - or invites, for that matter -\nin public. Share your Zoom room invite in an email, or over more secure chat\napps, from you to one person. One person to another person - not via mass\nemail lists. The more people with whom a Zoom invite is sent, the higher the\nchance is that this invite will be shared (intentionally or unintentionally)\nwith individuals who weren't invited in the first place.\n\n## Try something else\n\nTry [Microsoft Teams](https://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-teams-was-down-this-\nmorning-for-office-365-03608328/), [Hangouts\nMeet](https://www.slashgear.com/hangouts-chat-meet-to-be-available-to-all-\nbefore-hangouts-death-02556568/), Zoho Meeting, or GoToMeeting. You could try\nCisco Webex Meetings (or see [Slack](https://www.slashgear.com/slack-is-\nrolling-out-a-simpler-redesigned-ui-with-new-features-18613677/)), LifeSize,\nGlobalMeet Collaboration, or BlueJeans. There is no perfect solution - but\nthere are definitely more solutions than just Zoom!\n\n## Story Timeline\n\n  * [Group video chatting is Snapchat's newest feature (and Instagram's sudden

Therefore the WHO\nhas asked the state and the federal government to announce the lockdown.

The startup\nis using **Zoho Teams** for internal communication.\n\n  \n\n>  **Shrijay Sheth, Founder of LegalWiz** , says, \"Fortunately we had invested\n> in technology and our entire ERP CRM is cloud-driven. Operationally, not a\n> lot has changed.\"\n\n  \n\nShrijay has divided his employees into teams, and spends 50 minutes with each\nteam every day. \"We use these video conferences to raise concerns, address\ndoubts, and communicate better.\"\n\n  \n\nFor [**Patna-based edtech startup Cymatic**\n,](https://yourstory.com/2019/11/startup-bharat-patna-edtech-startup-cymatic)\nthe shift to remotely working has not been much of a challenge. \"Besides Zoom,\nwe are using our own platform for video conferencing,\" says **Founder Kaushik\nSharaf**. Cymatic provides interactive virtual classrooms and peer learning\nusing synchronisation.\n\n  \n\n**Ranchi-based recruitment platform**[\n**Biofie**](https://yourstory.com/2020/02/startup-bharat-ranchi-based-\nrecruitment-startup-biofie-naukri) uses Google collaborative sheets to\nidentify deliverables of team members, at any given point of time.\n\n  \n\n> However, to make the most of these tools, a strong internet connection is\n> mandatory.

The startup's\nmonthly flight searches have gone down from 4.5 lakh to almost nil. \" **We\nwill not be able to survive the next three months unless we do a pivot** ,\"\nYajnesh says.\n\n  \n\nSimilarly, for **Jaipur-based bootcamp startup Forsk Coding School** , almost\n60 percent of the revenue comes between the months of May and July. However,\nlooking at the current scenario, **Founder Yogendra Singh** is not expecting\nthe [physical bootcamp to take place. ](https://yourstory.com/2020/02/startup-\nbharat-jaipur-forsk-coding-school-lambda-masai-school-pesto)\n\n  \n\n\"Since the last two weeks, we are running free live classes to ensure traction\nfor an online cohort that we will set up in mid-April,\" he says.\n\n  \n\nForsk recorded **2,000-plus registrations** in the first week of starting its\nlive classes, which are usually one-week long. The startup is **banking on\nthese interactions** to later launch a **paid model of online courses**.\n\n  \n\n> \"Our usual bootcamp courses are priced at Rs 15,000. For the online course,\n> we will charge around Rs 5,000,\" Yogendra says.\n\n  \n\nForsk has a **secondary revenue stream** where it does consultation for its\nclients. Yogendra says this has been **helping the startup sustain** , and it\ncan stay afloat for a couple of months more without the direct source of\nrevenue.\n\n  \n\n**Jaipur-based ExpertRight** , which bridges the gap between freelancers and\nservice-seekers or companies, has been adapting to the nuances of the gig\neconomy since inception. Thus, not much changed for **Founder Ayush Goyal** ,\nwhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown across the\ncountry.\n\n  \n\n> \"Being from a small city, our rent and operational costs have always been\n> minimal. Thus, **it is not as difficult for us to manage cash burn as is for\n> consumer-facing companies** ,\" he says.\n\n  \n\nLegalWiz is **keeping unnecessary expenses in check**, and shrinking its\nmarketing budget. \"We are identifying money-bringing activities,\" Shrijay\nsays.\n\n  \n\nThe team is utilising its knowledge banks - the operations team. The\noperations team has been volunteering to document information and providing\ncontent for its blogs.\n\n  \n\n**Kaushik Sharaf, Founder of Cymatic,** says, \"Looking at the recent\nvolatility in the market, one of our investors backed out.

The\nreality is that most [home network setups are far less secure\n](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/the-fbi-is-warning-that-your-smart-home-\ndevices-arent-secure-heres-what-you-should-do-about-it.html)than what most\noffice workers are used to, making them far more vulnerable to attack. While\nit's impossible to eliminate every risk, the good news is that there are a few\nthings you can do to [protect yourself and your\ninformation](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/businesses-are-spying-on-their-\nremote-employees-thats-not-how-to-keep-them-productive.html) from hackers and\nother bad actors.\n\nHere are six things you can do:\n\n## Secure Your Zoom Meetings\n\n[I wrote about this specifically yesterday](https://www.inc.com/jason-\naten/hackers-are-trying-to-get-into-your-zoom-meetings-here-are-5-ways-to-\nstop-them.html), but with the prevalence of \"Zoombombing,\" where hackers log\ninto your Zoom meeting and take it over by sharing inappropriate materials,\nyou should take steps to protect yourself. The [FBI has even issued a\nwarning](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-\nreleases/fbi-warns-of-teleconferencing-and-online-classroom-hijacking-during-\ncovid-19-pandemic). Fortunately, there are a few things you can do like using\nthe waiting room function, disabling screen sharing, and using a meeting\npassword.\n\n## Don't Click on Unfamiliar Links\n\nEspecially Zoom invitations. Every legit Zoom meeting looks the same:\nhttps://zoom.us/j/ followed by the meeting ID. If it's close, but not exactly\nthat, it could be from a scammer trying to get your information. According to\n[research from Check\nPoint](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/03/30/covid-19-impact-cyber-criminals-\ntarget-zoom-domains/), there has been a surge of fake domains registered\ntrying to capitalize on people sending Zoom invites. Don't fall victim to\ntheir scams. Always check, and if something doesn't seem right, don't click on\nit.\n\n## Don't Give Up Login Info\n\nMany phishing scams work by sending you what appears to be a legitimate link.\nWhen you click on it, however, it takes you to a fraudulent website that\nhappens to look legit, but definitely is not. As a general rule, never give\npersonal information to a link that you receive in an email. There are no\nbanks that will ask you to do this, no matter how convincing the email. Even\nif you do get a legitimate email, it's still better to type the known website\naddress directly into your browser.\n\n## Don't Download Attachments\n\nScammers have been sending attachments with malicious code for as long as\nthere has been email. If you get an email with an attachment you weren't\nexpecting, even if it appears to be from someone you know, double check first.\nBy the way, replying to the email isn't the best way to find out. Send a\nbrand-new email to the address that you know belongs to the sender since a\nspoofed email will end up going back to the scammer--who can then \"confirm\"\nthat you should open the file.\n\n## Put a Password on Your Wi-Fi\n\nIf you still haven't secured your home Wi-Fi network, now is the time. The\nlast thing you need is a bored neighbor or curious hacker accessing your\nnetwork. You might think it isn't a big deal until you realize that once\nsomeone logs on, it's possible to snoop on your internet traffic and even gain\naccess to your devices.\n\n## Use a VPN\n\nA virtual private network (VPN) creates a secure path for your internet\ntraffic, preventing others from snooping or tracking what you do. VPNs are\ncommon among larger businesses that have employees accessing a company network\nor server.\n\nFor small businesses and individuals, however, there's still a huge benefit to\nkeeping your personal and company information secure and away from prying\neyes. Providers like Dashlane and NordVPN offer affordable options that are\neasy to install and use.\n\nPublished on: Apr 1, 2020\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from Inc.\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"}, {"item": "Tips for Responsible and Smart Marketing During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Inc.", "link": "https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/tips-for-responsible-smart-marketing-during-covid-19-pandemic.html", "guid": "CAIiEJy-R64nJbnrq2Zngkbt2CgqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow8dTjAjCY4RswhaoM", "pubdate": "Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:02:24 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/tips-for-responsible-smart-marketing-during-covid-19-pandemic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tips for Responsible and Smart Marketing During the COVID-19 Pandemic</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Inc.</font>", "source": "Inc.", "body": "[![](//www.incimages.com/inc-logo-black.png)](/)\n\nTips for Responsible and Smart Marketing During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n#### [Marketing](https://www.inc.com/marketing)\n\n#\n\nTips for Responsible and Smart Marketing During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n## It's crucial that brands address this issue with a sense of tact.\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/PeterRoeslerauthorphotonew_349702.jpg)](/author/peter-\nroesler)[By Peter Roesler](/author/peter-roesler)President, Small Business\nSEO[@KickAss_SEO](https://www.twitter.com/KickAss_SEO)\n\n![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_1209272477_2000129120009280129_417277.jpg)\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn everything your brand does, context matters. Beyond the most basic actions\ntaken to help protect businesses and employees during crisis situations,\nbrands will either help or hinder the collective experience. When a cultural\nmoment occurs and dramatically affects the world, as it has during the\n[COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/how-to-get-your-\nbusiness-through-coronavirus-crisis.html), it's crucial that brands address\nthis issue with a sense of tact, [mindful\nmarketing](https://themanifest.com/digital-marketing/how-approach-apply-\nmindfulness-marketing), and empathy.\n\nWith that in mind, when it comes to existing and planned campaigns, modern\nmarketing teams face unique and often unplanned challenges during the Crisis.\nEven though it is still early during the quarantine process, many businesses\nare already adjusting the way they communicate with clients and customers.\nWith that in mind, you can find some general guidelines here for marketing\nyour business in this unusual situation.\n\n## Adjust Scheduled Content Timelines and Marketing Campaigns\n\nThere are many brands that can create fast-turn campaigns designed for a\nspecific moment. An example of this was Ford when vehicle ads were swapped for\na [campaign focused on the Coronavirus\nresponse](https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/ford-pulls-national-vehicle-\nads-replacing-them-coronavirus-response-campaign/2244726?utm_source=ad-age-\nnews-alerts&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20200316&utm_content=hero-headline).\nWhile these are impressive, there are some prohibitive risks that make this\ntype of war-room action unachievable and unrealistic for most businesses.\n\nThe first step for a brand to consider is what is currently running or in the\npipeline, including pre-scheduled content that is set to launch soon. During\nthis audit, consider the following:\n\n\u00b7         Determine what to pause right now\n\n\u00b7         Consider what to pivot or prioritize\n\nThe good news is that taking a break from content may provide an advantage\nafter things get back to normal. Right now, it's a good idea for you to\nprepare for upcoming cultural moments (i.e., post-quarantine) and figure out\nwhat content will be most impactful and relevant then.\n\n## Evaluate the Language and Imagery Being Used\n\nThere's no question that visual communication is powerful, along with the\nwords that are used. It's crucial to think about what type of message your\nbrand is conveying. Some things to look at and consider changing include:\n\n\u00b7         Remove or avoid the use of visuals where people or crowds are\ntouching\n\n\u00b7         Reframe your marketing language that may describe a close\ninteraction with others\n\n\u00b7         Swap out your visuals if needed\n\nTake some time to see what changes you can make that would be beneficial to\nthe Crisis right now.\n\n## Don't Try to Capitalize on the Crisis\n\nThis is applicable to any crisis or tragedy, but it is especially important to\nremember in the existing climate where fear and worry are top of mind. While\nit's a good idea to keep people informed about how the Crisis is affecting the\nbusiness, make sure you aren't spread panic or become an alarmist.\n\nWhen it comes to marketing through this Crisis, keeping the tips and\ninformation here in mind can be invaluable. Being informed is the best way to\nensure you are able to make it through this Crisis unscathed and that your\ncustomers see your efforts during this difficult time.\n\nPublished on: Apr 1, 2020\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from Inc.\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"}, {"item": "COVID-19: Meeting the challenges of working from home -

outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has seen all businesses, save\nessential services, asking their employees to work from home, in an effort to\npractise social distancing and lessen the impact of the virus.**\n\nRemote working is effective on multiple levels. It ensures that employees are\nsafe and productive, and transforms businesses, by equipping them with\nresilient and adaptive ways to engage with their stakeholders and deliver\neconomic value, writes Stefan Mayer, Managing Director at Corporate AV\nIntegration.\n\n**Read more on:  \n[Health and safety](https://www.esi-africa.com/tag/health-and-safety/)**\n\nHowever, it is not without its hurdles. \u201cAs many of us start to work from\nhome, we are learning of the immediate challenges we are facing,\u201d says a\nspokesperson from Corporate AV. \u201cThese affect us from different perspectives,\nincluding the company in terms of making the appropriate decision from an\ninvestment or efficiency point of view, those being in charge for the IT\ninfrastructure, and any employee who is working remotely.\u201d\n\n## Bandwidth\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s look at bandwidth and connectivity. \u201cCompanies need to figure\nout how much bandwidth employees need to work from home and stay connected.\nTechnologies such as video conferencing (VC) need to receive and to transmit\ndata, meaning looking at the download speed only isn\u2019t enough. The highest\ncommon denominator is needed here - 10 Mbps internet connection isn\u2019t\nnecessarily symmetrical, it could be 10 Mbps down and only 2 Mbps up, meaning\nthe common bandwidth is 2 Mbps. In addition, other users within the household\nneed to be factored in.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether the Internet is plugged in or WIFI. \u201cThis\nis a crucial consideration. We live in the wireless world and expect\neverything to work perfectly wirelessly, but this is not the case. Few\nwireless routers or access points have the necessary throughput, so running a\nnetwork cable from the router to the home office location, is ideal.\u201d\n\n## Software considerations\n\nThe way remote work is handled varies from company to company, he adds. \u201cMany\nwill have IT policies in place, which need to be adhered to. Remote workers\nmight be required to work via VPN\u2019s in order to access shared resources on\nmain servers, which can have an impact on network speeds and suchlike.\nCurrently, many IT departments are figuring out the best route to go, as many\nare unprepared, and are scrambling to work it out as quickly as possible to\navoid downtime and lost productivity.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson says VPN\u2019s are an effective way to maintain firewalls and\nsafety on corporate networks, and remote users are monitored and software\nupdates can be managed.\n\nWhen it comes to SMMEs, he says most smaller entities have no hard and fast\nsystem in place for remote workers and are now figuring out how to connect\ntheir remote workers. Many will ask their staff if they have a home Internet\nconnection, then will work out data allocation, and either offer to pay the\nmonthly fee or supply a LTE router with a contract.\n\n**Read more about:  \n[Working in a changing world as COVID-19 continues to spread](https://www.esi-\nafrica.com/features-analysis/working-in-a-changing-world-as-\ncovid-19-continues-to-spread/)**  \n **[What is the next stop for the Internet of Things?](https://www.esi-\nafrica.com/industry-sectors/smart-technologies/op-ed-what-is-the-next-stop-\nfor-the-internet-of-things/)**  \n\n\u201cOnce the hardware and environmental challenges have been dealt with,\nbusinesses need to focus on the software they will employ for their video\nconferencing and productivity needs. Again, in large enterprises, this will be\ncovered, as most have tools such as Office 365 in place with a Teams license\nor Google G suite with hangouts. For smaller companies who don\u2019t have a set\nway of doing things remotely, there are a plethora of tools available, such as\nZOOM, WebEx, Teams, Google Hangouts, Bluejeans, Pexip, Skype, GoToMeeting,\nZoho, to name but a few.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, choosing the appropriate solution requires understanding the\npros and cons of each. \u201cIn principle, they all work the same, so questions\nsuch as who employees will be VC calling with is key. Should they be mainly\nconnecting with other remote workers within the organisation, then it makes\nsense for all to use the same platform. Should they, however, be calling\nexternal clients, there might be a number of different systems being used,\nwhich is why many software applications work off a Web-based platform allowing\nusers to send a URL link to whomever they wish to call, who then need only\nclick on the link and the browser enables the call or a temporary software app\ngets installed.\u201d\n\nHe says the majority of software codecs are free to download and to use for\nlimited periods. \u201cSome keep all one-on-one calls free but will limit the time\nof each call, others allow multiparty calling but without a scheduling\nfunction, and some limit the time on multi-party calling or offer free session\nrecording. All software-based operators have a paid-for, prime version with\nenhanced features, unlimited calling duration, up to 100 participants in\nmultiparty calls, unlimited recording time and suchlike.\u201d\n\n## Camera, microphone, speaker and headphone\n\nWhen it comes to the above, businesses need to decide whether to use external\nor internal devices, or a mixture of both. Most laptops come with a Webcam,\nbut they tend to angle up the user\u2019s nostrils, meaning an external camera is\nyour best bet, says the spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThis should always be positioned at eye height to ensure the eyes can be seen\nby the far side. Moreover, there is nothing worse than not being able to hear\nthe far side, so a good microphone is essential. And while many use Bluetooth\nearpieces, or wireless air pods, these are not great in my opinion. The\nmicrophones don\u2019t pick up well enough, as voices project forward. On the plus\nside, most external cameras feature built-in microphones, which, as they are\npositioned right in front of the user, pick up voice with perfect clarity.\nOther options include a desktop Jabra speak 510 speakerphone, Shure MV51 or a\nLogitech external microphone.\u201d\n\n[Sign up for the ESI Africa newsletter](https://www.esi-africa.com/subscribe-\nto-newsletter/)\n\n## External monitor\n\nThe spokesperson says next, companies need to consider whether to use a single\nor dual monitor setup. \u201cWithout a doubt, a good setup will require screen real\nestate. Workers need to have the requisite space for their various tasks, so\nit becomes a question of how to arrange the layout effectively. Do we use a\nlaptop with one external monitor or a desktop computer with two? Many\nemployees who were previously office-bound employees won\u2019t have laptops and\nmight be given their desktop PC to use at home. In this scenario, all external\ndevices will need to be considered such as monitors, speakers, mics and\ncameras.\u201d\n\nHe advises avoiding buying the cheapest monitor available, as these might not\nbe suitable. \u201cCareful consideration needs to be taken to establish the real\nestate required, and what resolution is appropriate. Often, extra-wide\nmonitors, which have the ability to show multiple documents side by side, will\noften eliminate the need for two monitors side by side and come only at a\nslightly higher cost.\u201d\n\nFinally, he says when an employee will be working from home indefinitely, an\nergonomically comfortable workspace needs to be created. \u201cThings to consider\nhere are seating position, type of chair with back arch support, head\nposition, and the position of the monitor becomes of vital importance.\u201d\n\n## Etiquette\n\n\u201cFew have given much thought to how they should behave in this new reality,\u201d\nhe adds. \u201cEmployees are still technically \u2018at work\u2019, so would wearing\nsweatpants and a t-shirt be acceptable? Are we permitted to let ourselves go\nas we believe we likely won\u2019t be seeing anyone today? These are all\nconsiderations, which although might seem trivial, are not necessarily. People\nwho have been working from home for some time, understand that discipline is\nkey to a successful workday. Many think working from home means sleeping in,\nbinging on Netflix shows and similar. However, having a daily routine in place\nis key to making this work, and managers need to stop micromanaging their\nemployees and manage based on outcomes.\u201d\n\n[![](https://www.esi-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AUW-NOVEMBER-\nBANNER.gif)](https://www.clarion-events-group.com/ESI_AUW20_Inarticlelink)\n\n## Lighting, makeup, clothes\n\nAnother consideration, says spokesperson, is where the light source is coming\nfrom. \u201cCameras must adjust for different contrast etc, depending on the user\u2019s\nskin tone and the amount of natural light, as otherwise faces can appear to be\ntoo dark or light with varying degrees of shadowing taking place. A desk lamp\npositioned from above to reduce shadows as well as light up your face is\nrecommended. Users who wear glasses should conduct some tests to see how the\nlight reflects on their lenses, as people on the other side are able to see\nthe reflections on their screen.\u201d\n\nIn terms of what to wear, he advises to keep things professional, and quotes\nKarl Lagerfeld, who said: \u201cSweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control\nof your life so you bought some sweatpants.\u201d\n\n## Background\n\nIn order to be clearly visible, spokesperson says it is good practice to use a\nneutral background with little to no movement - think curtains and blinds,\nwhich can move in the wind. The colours users wear should also to be in\ncontrast with their environment, to ensure they stand out in the video. Many\nVC software applications have the ability to add a virtual background. This is\na great idea.\n\n## A final word of advice\n\n\u201cWorking from home is the new reality, and will be for the foreseeable future.\nIt is also bound to have a profound impact on the way we work in the future.\nWe all need to grab this opportunity and embrace it, and transform our\nworkplaces now, before we get left behind,\u201d he ends.\n\n  * [

He found a clever new way to keep himself\nand his employees working: Have dancers in near-topless costumes deliver\ndinners to area residents.\n\nIt all started with a joking tweet after Oregon governor Kate Brown issued an\norder to close all bars and restaurants for anything but takeout or delivery\nto slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n> Working on keeping our kitchen open for food deliveries and our staff\n> employed. Dancers will be delivering the food orders topless to your\n> doorstep. Calling it Boober\n> [#boober](https://twitter.com/hashtag/boober?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#luckydevillounge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/luckydevillounge?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n>\n> \\-- Lucky Devil Lounge (@LuckyDevil_PDX) [March 17,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/LuckyDevil_PDX/status/1239991446301626369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nShon Boulden, co-owner of the Lucky Devil Lounge and Devils Point strip clubs\nin Portland was just kidding when he tweeted this. But to his surprise, people\nbegan contacting him to ask if the strippers would be delivering to their\narea. \"I was like, 'Holy shit, this may be something that actually works,'\" he\n[told](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/boober-eats-lucky-\ndevil-lounge-strip-club-covid-19-coronavirus-quarantine-971544/) _Rolling\nStone_.\n\nIt really should have shocked no one that in the Pacific Northwest, home to\n[bikini baristas](http://preview.inc.com/minda-zetlin/no-bikini-baristas-your-\nright-to-serve-coffee-while-exposing-body-parts-is-not-in-constitution.html),\npeople would assume that this was a real service. In any case, Boulden saw an\nopportunity and ran with it.\n\nHe came up with a simple business model: Pairs of exotic dancers (accompanied\nby a driver/bouncer) would deliver meals to customers for a $30 delivery fee\n(plus tips). The fee would be divided between the club and the dancers. They\nwould wear face masks and gloves and pasties over their nipples and not a\nwhole lot more. They would set the food by the door and then perform a little\ndance for customers from at least six feet away. (They'd wear sweaters on\ntheir way to and from the delivery so as to stay warm and avoid shocking the\nneighbors.) Both the dancers and the club would earn a lot less than they\nnormally did, but it would be much better than nothing. The service would be\ncalled \"Boober Eats.\"\n\n## Uber was not amused.\n\nThe idea immediately went viral, with lots of media attention and orders\npouring in. Unfortunately, a cease-and-desist order also came in from Uber,\nwhich is famously litigious and not at all amused by the name. Boulden\nimmediately capitulated. \"I'm pretty sure Uber is a billion-dollar\ncorporation, and we're Lucky Devil Lounge,\" he\n[told](https://www.wweek.com/bars/2020/03/31/uber-eats-has-forced-lucky-devil-\nlounges-stripper-food-delivery-service-to-change-its-name/)  _Willamette\nWeek_. Besides, he said, losing the name hasn't hurt business in the least.\nThe service is busier than ever and media interest continues to be strong.\n\nWhat name will replace Boober Eats? For now, Boulden is using the name Lucky\nDevil Eats, but that may change if something truly funny comes along. He told\n_Willamette Week_  that his friends have proposed a bunch of new names on\nsocial media, among them \"Peels on Wheels,\" \"Pole Mates,\" and \"Porn Grub.\"\nHe's still looking for ideas.\n\nPublished on: Mar 31, 2020\n\nLike this column?

 * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * [Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\))\n\nRegister now\n\nAs I write this, things are going from bad to worse with the COVID-19 crisis.\nWith the high level of anxiety that comes with a stressful situation, and the\nequally high level of uncertainty, it\u2019s easy to get distracted. But the fact\nis that most of us are now working from home, and while this is unfamiliar to\nmany, that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, even though the circumstances that\nnecessitate it are frightening.\n\nBut the clich\u00e9 \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d was never truer than it\nis at this moment. While many of us have been using video conferencing\napplications for years, others are for the first time having to struggle with\nunfamiliar applications like Zoom, Skype, WebEx, other video platforms, and\nother ways to stay in touch and collaborate.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s easy to start feeling alienated, it\u2019s important to remember\nthat your staff and clients are experiencing similar feelings. Working from\nhome is one thing. Being forced to do it is an entirely different experience.\nEven those of us used to remote work can start feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**As close as the nearest keyboard**\n\nI\u2019ve been working from my home office on and off over the past several\ndecades, so you think I\u2019d be used to it. And, for the most part, the habits\nthat I\u2019ve developed are standing me well, at least at the moment. And because\nI\u2019ve been working at home all those years, I\u2019m used to working with clients\nand associates over the phone, by email, and over video. But right now, I\nstill terribly miss those times where it was necessary to travel to a client,\nor meet over a meal.\n\nOne thing that stands out very clearly is that I\u2019ve had to become proficient\nin a number of video platforms, as some of my clients and associates use Skype\nor Lync, some others use Cisco Webex, and more and more are using Zoom.\n\nZoho, as part of its Business One collection of apps, has both\nvideoconferencing and collaboration software as part of its collection of\napplications, so if you have a number of clients who really feel uncomfortable\nwith videoconferencing and inexperienced with online collaboration, it might\npay to take a look at Zoho\u2019s offerings as something that\u2019s easy to use, and\nvery affordable (or even free). And now is a good time to try and mix\nfrugality with accessibility.\n\nBut more important than the platform you use is the need to put forth a\nconcerted effort to let your staff and clients know that you are there for\nthem. If you have expertise in financial planning, wealth management, IT or\nany other specialty, now is the time to make sure that your clients know that\nyou are experienced with services you may not currently offer them, and that\nyou\u2019re available for consultation and advice. If at all possible, try and\nprovide these new services at a very reasonable price, or even for free, as\nall of us are likely to suffer financial fallout before this crisis resolves.  \n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/4c/29/a7ef315f43d1a5f441359ffa83e6/adobestock-329714231.jpeg)  \n**Keeping in touch**\n\nWhile you have a lot on your mind (and on your plate) right now, if you aren\u2019t\nalready using a customer relationship management (CRM) application, now is\ndefinitely the right time to get started using one. If the vendor you use for\nyour writeup and other client-facing applications offers CRM, that might be\nthe easiest and quickest way to get up and running with CRM. And if your\napplication supplier doesn\u2019t offer CRM, there are plenty of vendors who do.\nDepending on your finances, you might want to be cautious about spending a lot\nof money right now, but vendors like Zoho and Xero offer excellent and\naffordable cloud-based CRM systems.\n\nThere are lots of resources targeted at CRM online. One that I can recommend\nis the CRM Playaz videocasts available on LinkedIn and Facebook. The CRM\nPlayaz are a trio of consultants and analysts \u2014 Paul Greenburg (also known as\nthe \u201cGodfather of CRM\u201d), Brent Leary, and Brian Solis. All of them are expert\nin CRM as well as CX, or customer experience, and have very successful\nconsulting practices. This trio gets together online at least once a week,\nsometimes more frequently, and discusses various topics surrounding these\nareas of conducting business. They also frequently have high-level executives\nof relevant software companies such as Salesforce on their videocasts. Their\nvideocasts are as far from dry and boring as possible, and in addition to\nbeing an enjoyable use of an hour or so, you\u2019ll pick up some good advice you\ncan use in your practice. Their videocasts are interactive, which makes them\neven more of an enjoyable experience.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IMPACT: ADDITIONAL COVERAGE\n\n  1.

[Coronavirus and Wayfair decision affecting state tax revenues](https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/coronavirus-and-wayfair-decision-affecting-state-tax-revenues)\n\n**The more things change**\n\nIf there\u2019s anything to be learned from this crisis, it\u2019s that there is no such\nthing as \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d any more. The way that we interact in business,\nand in our relationships, will hopefully trend toward the way it used to be as\nthis crisis resolves. But it will never go exactly back to the way it was just\na short time ago. Now that we know that it\u2019s possible for things to go to\npieces, we need to plan for the contingencies of something similar happening\nin the future. The pandemic took most of us by surprise, but it\u2019s also forcing\nus to develop different ways for us to interact.\n\nAnd one of these is that it\u2019s going to continue to be a common practice for\nmany of us to frequently work remotely and, hopefully, to have a greater\nappreciation of the relationships we have with staff, clients, associates and\nfriends.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to have to place greater reliance on the equipment and\nsoftware we use day-to-day, so now may be a good time to take an inventory of\nwhat you have and what you think you might need in the future. With a greater\nreliance on connecting over the internet, you need to know that you\u2019ll have\nthe capability if your equipment and/or network fails. Having a spare PC or\nlaptop, with a duplicate of the software you use, is a good strategy, as is\nupgrading your network equipment including switches and routers. Going to a\nhigher speed internet service might not be possible in the high-demand\ncircumstances we\u2019re in at the present, but it probably should be on your\nchecklist of things to take care of at the earliest possible time.\n\nHaving multiple backups has become more necessary than it\u2019s ever been before.\nSo, take a hard look at how and where you are performing them now, and build\nin as much redundancy as you can.\n\nAnd, most of all, try and keep as positive an outlook as you can, and stay\nengaged with the people you know. Be there for them, but understand that they\nare as worried and isolated as you may feel, and reaching out, and staying in\nconstant touch, is not only good business, but a good way to conduct your\nlife.\n\nMost of all, stay safe and healthy.

Here's How Elon Musk Nails It\n\n## Controlling your schedule is the key to developing the highest level of\nconcentration, says Nir Eyal, author of 'Indistractable.' Here's a look at how\nElon Musk does it--and how you can too.\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/JessicaStillman_800x800_20914.jpg)](/author/jessica-\nstillman)[By Jessica Stillman](/author/jessica-stillman)Contributor,\nInc.com[@EntryLevelRebel](https://www.twitter.com/EntryLevelRebel)\n\n![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/GettyImages-1175368064_414061.jpg)\n\nYichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIn [a Medium post](https://onezero.medium.com/being-indistractable-will-be-\nthe-skill-of-the-future-a07780cf36f4) about his new book\n_[Indistractable](https://www.amazon.com/Indistractable-Control-Your-\nAttention-Choose/dp/194883653X?tag=inccom028-20)_ , Nir Eyal, a\n[design](https://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/business-leaders-\nthink-these-7-product-design-trends-will-be-big-in-2020.html) expert and\nStanford lecturer, shares an anecdote that will be instantly familiar to any\nmodern [parent](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/parents-who-give-their-kids-\nmr-rogers-like-focused-attention-help-them-thrive-according-to-this-\npsychologist.html)\\--and to you, as a business owner who faces\n[distractions](https://www.inc.com/quora/4-simple-habits-that-will-make-your-\nworkday-distraction-proof.html) at every turn.  \n\n\"If you could have any superpower, what would it be?\" Eyal asks his daughter.\nBut before she can answer, Eyal's phone buzzes and an email distracts him from\nthe conversation.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you what she said in that moment, but I can't. While she\nwas telling me her dream superpower, I was busy staring at my phone,\" Eyal\nrecalls. \"By the time I looked up, she had left the room. I'd blown a perfect\ndaddy-daughter moment because I was distracted.\" At that moment he decided on\nhis dream superpower. Forget flying or X-ray vision, Eyal wanted to be\nindistractable. Eyal wrote a whole book to figure out how to get there. Here\nare some insights from the book that can help you get there, too.\n\n## Schedule your day to become indistractable.\n\nThe fact that concentration isn't an everyday skill, but a full-on superpower,\nsays a lot about [how we've designed our modern\nworld](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/18/indistractable-control-\nattention-nir-eyal-review). One of [Eyal's\nsuggestions](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/super-power-tomorrow-being-\nindistractable) to improve your focus is already popular with some of the\nworld's most productive people, including[ Elon\nMusk](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/elon-musk-productivity-tip-tesla-\nspacex-5-minute-rule.html) and [Bill Gates](https://curiosity.com/topics/elon-\nmusk-and-bill-gates-schedule-their-days-in-5-minute-chunks-curiosity/).\n\nIt's called timeboxing, or a zero-based calendar, and it boils down to\nscheduling literally every minute of your day, even periods you devote to\n[daydreaming](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/daydreaming-is-a-sign-of-\nintelligence-new-study-says.html) or eating breakfast.\n\nThat might sound like a level of organization only required of billionaire\nmoguls, but Eyal offers a version of the technique that anyone can use.\nStartup RescueTime has [a helpful in-depth\nexplainer](https://blog.rescuetime.com/time-blocking-101/). Here are the\nbasics:\n\n  1. **Reflect on your priorities.** Why are you doing this? Knowing what your goals are will help you decide what to schedule and how you'll put it into your day.\n\n  2. **Start with your routine.** Most basic tasks--meals, exercise, spending time with loved ones--follow a daily rhythm. Start filling in your calendar with those activities, such as \"Eat breakfast and get ready\" every day from 6 to 7 a.m. \n\n  3. **Schedule your most focused tasks.** Now that you have a basic framework for your day, schedule in the most complex and meaningful tasks that demand unbroken blocks of concentration. \n\n  4. **Block out \"reactive\" time.  **Deep work is important, but that's not your entire day. You need time to react to stuff and put out fires, so block out reactive time each day.  \n\n  5. **Add a daily to-do list.** What's left? All the little minutiae of day-to-day life. \"Write out your tasks for the day and fit them into the appropriate slots,\" instructs RescueTime. \n\nIs this time consuming? Sure, timeboxing demands real effort. But Eyal\nsuggests if you want to [tame your distractions](https://www.inc.com/jessica-\nstillman/10-distraction-killing-tools-for-better-concentration.html) and\ncontrol how you spend your time (and your life), you should take the time to\nschedule every minute.\n\nPublished on: Apr 1, 2020\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from Inc.\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"}, {"item": "Zoho Corp announces 'work from home' to all employees amid coronavirus outbreak - YourStory", "link": "https://yourstory.com/2020/03/zoho-corp-announces-work-from-home-coronavirus", "guid": "CAIiEAm_vY_l-4GIVFIg0VUQC2oqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow6-iECzC_7YEDMIfQhAY", "pubdate": "Thu, 05 Mar 2020 13:26:31 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2020/03/zoho-corp-announces-work-from-home-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">Zoho Corp announces 'work from home' to all employees amid coronavirus outbreak</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">YourStory</font>", "source": "YourStory", "body": "[![](/logos/logo_yourstory.svg)](/)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_search_new.svg)](/search/)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_notification_new.svg)](/notifications)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_bookmark_new.svg)](/me/bookmarks)\n\n[![](/logos/logo_yourstory.svg)](/)\n\n![](/icons/ic_overflow_menu.svg)\n\n[![](/icons/ic_search_new.svg)](/search)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil)[\u0905](/hindi)[\u0c85](/kannada)\n\n[YourStory](/)[Academy](https://offer.yourstory.com/the-funding-course-\nfacebook)[HerStory](/herstory)[SocialStory](/socialstory)[SMBStory](/smbstory)[YourStoryTV](/videos)\n\nMore![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[Awards](/awards/50-disruptive-startups-of-india-2019)[Advertise With\nUs](https://share.hsforms.com/1pqFuZ_AaRMa4bw6jAcPFAQ3xg7b)[AutoStory](/automotive)[MyStory](/mystory)[Weekender](/weekender)[Journal](/journal)[YS\nKorea](/korea)[Deutschland](/deutschland)[Germany](/germany)[Events](https://events.yourstory.com)[Visual](https://visual.yourstory.com)\n\nLanguage![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[English](/)[Kannada](/kannada)[Hindi](/hindi)[Tamil](/tamil)[Asamiya](/asamiya)[Bangla](/bangla)[Gujarati](/gujarati)[Malayalam](/malayalam)[Marathi](/marathi)[Odia](/odia)[Punjabi](/punjabi)[Telugu](/telugu)[Urdu](/urdu)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil \"Tamil\")[\u0905](/hindi \"Hindi\")[\u0c85](/kannada \"Kannada\")\n\nLogin![profile_placeholder](/icons/ic_profile.svg)\n\nLanguage![](/icons/ic_dropdown_icon.svg)\n\n[English](/)[Kannada](/kannada)[Hindi](/hindi)[Tamil](/tamil)[Asamiya](/asamiya)[Bangla](/bangla)[Gujarati](/gujarati)[Malayalam](/malayalam)[Marathi](/marathi)[Odia](/odia)[Punjabi](/punjabi)[Telugu](/telugu)[Urdu](/urdu)\n\n[\u0b85](/tamil \"Tamil\")[\u0905](/hindi \"Hindi\")[\u0c85](/kannada \"Kannada\")\n\nLogin![profile_placeholder](/icons/ic_profile.svg)\n\n  * [Health](/category/health)\n\n# Zoho Corp announces 'work from home' to all employees amid coronavirus\noutbreak\n\nChennai-headquartered Zoho currently has presence in France, Italy, the United\nStates, Sweden, Germany among others.

The mandated precautions being put into\nplace due to Covid-19 has left most workforces attempting to [adapt to working\ncompletely remote](https://www.inc.com/partners-in-leadership/what-beyond-\nmeat-ipo-can-teach-us-about-organizational-agility.html). As uncertainty\nswirls around us, leaders are faced with the challenge of helping employees\nfocus on what they can control.\n\n[Culture is leader-led.](https://www.inc.com/partners-in-leadership/when-do-\nyou-revamp-your-company-culture-from-inside-out.html) That's perhaps truer\nthan ever in a moment like this. So much of the engagement level and focus a\nteam demonstrates is a [result of the\nexperiences](https://www.inc.com/partners-in-leadership/the-3-things-that-\nevery-visionary-leader-knows.html) their immediate leaders are creating.\n\n **Increase Visibility as Certainty Decreases**\n\nLeaders should increase visibility in moments of disruption and uncertainty.\nThis leads to greater [alignment and\nfocus.](https://www.partnersinleadership.com/insights-publications/how-to-\nhold-employees-accountable-step-3-align-employees-around-expectations/) Most\nof us are now attending virtual meetings. Those should be happening frequently\n- with web cams on. A team needs to see their leader right now. Your body\nlanguage speaks volumes. It can be calming.\n\nIn the absence of virtual meetings, the next best way to increase visibility\nis through conference calls, short video clips, or emails. None of this\ncommunication has to be lengthy, but it should be frequent.\n\nIf your team normally has meetings once a week, you might consider doing them\ntwo or three times a week. One of them could be the normal length. The others\ncould be briefer and feature a \"huddle-like\" atmosphere. The longer the period\nwithout seeing and hearing from a leader and peers right now, the higher\nlikelihood of distraction, confusion, and a lack of focus.\n\nDoug McMillion, the President and CEO of Walmart, is one leader who is\neffectively demonstrating this principle. Almost daily he is posting to\nLinkedIn pictures of him in different Walmart locations around the United\nStates. Along with the pictures of him interacting with Walmart associates on\nthe floor of the store are typically a few lines of text of what he heard and\nfelt while in the store.\n\nHe recently posted this message to his associates on social media as well,\n\"Dear associates, words can't express how proud I am of each of you for the\nincredible effort you have put in over the past few weeks. In the face of\nuncertainty, you have delivered for our customers, members and each other. To\nyou and your families: Thank you. I'm grateful.\"\n\nMcMillion's visibility is intentional and designed to demonstrate empathy as\nwell as focus. His employees can see what their leader is doing in the midst\nof the chaos around him.\n\n **Help People Feel Heard, Virtually**\n\nAs we increase visibility, aim to both communicate adjustments the business is\nmaking in light of fast-changing market conditions as well as give people the\nopportunity to feel heard. Our visibility shouldn't be just one direction.\nFacilitating discussion during this moment leads to greater focus and\nalignment.\n\nAn effective question to ask a team during a virtual meeting would be: \"What\nreality do we most need to acknowledge right now?\" This question allows them\nto share all the disruption they're feeling. A follow up question might be,\n\"What part of the problem or solution do we need to own?\" That begins to\nrefocus the team's energy around what they control rather than the chaos. The\nnext two questions a leader might ask are, \"What else can we do right now?\"\nand, \"Who will do what, by when?\"\n\nWe call this process See It, Own It, Solve It, Do It. They are the Steps to\nAccountability. Accountability and ownership don't happen by accident.\nCreating a [Culture of\nAccountability](https://www.partnersinleadership.com/insights-\npublications/create-culture-of-accountability/) is never easy but current\nworld conditions make it incredibly challenging without intentional and\ncontinual effort by leaders.\n\n **Focus on Results**\n\nVirtual teams need constant reminders of [what results matter\nmost](https://www.partnersinleadership.com/insights-publications/propeller-\nthe-digital-leadership-tool-that-focuses-your-team-on-key-results/). What\nresults do they need to be focused on? Without clear direction on the two to\nthree results the leader needs effort focused on right now, dispersed teams\nmight get distracted or spend time on things the leader doesn't view as most\nimportant.\n\nConsider an example: A large health insurance organization had thousands of\nemployees, from nurses to behavioral health professionals, working mostly from\nhomes located across the U.S. As the customer needs changed quickly, leaders\nof this part of the business huddled to define three Key Results that they\nneeded this remote workforce aligned around.\n\nOne was around growth. Another was customer experience. The third had to do\nwith compliance. In virtual sessions of no more than 100 employees at a time,\nleaders presented the [Key\nResults](https://www.partnersinleadership.com/insights-publications/propeller-\nthe-digital-leadership-tool-that-focuses-your-team-on-key-results/) and\nfacilitated discussion around them.\n\nNo organization has the luxury of time or calm right now. That increases the\nneed for clarity around the most critical results a team or teams need to\ndeliver in the short-term. When leaders clarify to remote employees the\nresults that matter most in the next few weeks or months, it allows the\nworkforce to make decisions around what to prioritize and what to stop working\non.\n\n **Recognize and Reward Desired Behavior**\n\nIn this moment of disruption, virtual meetings and [online collaboration\ntools](https://propellerapp.com/) provide a great opportunity to recognize and\nreward desired behavior. Innovation and adaptation are more important than\never. As you see members of your team demonstrating the urgency, agility, or\nproblem-solving mindset needed right now, call it out. That's easily done\ndigitally. It sends messages to others of what you, as the leader, are looking\nfor. Water what you want to grow right now.\n\nAs unsettling as these times are, they provide an opportunity: Disruption\ndestroys the status quo and accelerates innovation. Those who intentionally\nlead their team in the appropriate ways will find their remote workforce\nmaneuvering the rapids, even avoiding the boulders while using the white water\nto accelerate movement. They'll come out of this stronger and better\npositioned than before to meet the demands of their customer.\n\nPublished on: Mar 24, 2020\n\nLike this column?

The assistant is fully automated and works 24x7 and [handles\ncustomer queries like service appointments, quotes, FAQs and\nmore](https://yourstory.com/tag/saas).\n\n  \n\n![Emitrr](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/b3bfb136ab5e11e88691f70342131e20/emitrr-1586091862122.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nFounders of Emitrr\n\n##  **The founders**\n\nAnmol Oberoi was at Wingify (makers of VWO) and Pulkit Gambhir was working at\nAnaek when they first met in Delhi through a common friend in 2018.\n\n  \n\nEmitrr's idea was born out of an experience Anmol faced during his stay in the\nUS in 2019. He was staying alone on a modest budget, and would get his home\ncleaned once every two weeks. But getting through to the home cleaners and\nother local businesses was becoming a challenge. They would not answer his\ncalls. This was very frustrating, and that's when Pulkit and Anmol realised\nthat there is a pattern.\n\n  \n\n> \"Local businesses have small teams and are unable to answer customer calls\n> because they are busy serving other customers. This is how we came across\n> the idea to solve the problem of businesses missing calls. The person with\n> the bigger loss in most cases is always the business owner because they lose\n> the customer,\" Anmol tells **_YourStory_**.\n\n  \n\nAnmol Oberoi has five years of experience scaling marketing efforts of two\nmulti-million dollar SaaS products like Tracxn and VWO. Anmol was the first\nmember of Tracxn's marketing team and scaled it to 40 people in two years with\n25 direct reportees. At VWO, he experienced its journey from $16M to $20M ARR.\n\n  \n\nPulkit Gambhir has had five years of experience in scaling backend tech for\nSaaS brands such as Anaek and HeyMojo. Prior to his stint in the SaaS space,\nhe founded two startups in the B2C industry.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/b3bfb136ab5e11e88691f70342131e20/Image125m-1583405804746.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### This SaaS startup helps small businesses, single-store retailers create\ncustomer retention programmes\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2020/03/saas-startup-enthrall-labs-hyperk-customer-\nretention-loyalty)\n\n* * *\n\n## **The product**\n\n> \"Our product works on top of SMS. As soon as a business misses a call, our\n> human-like SMS assistant gets activated to answer the user queries or even\n> book a service. We use natural language processing to understand customer\n> queries and map the queries to data from multiple sources to fetch the best\n> possible response. This ensures customers getting the right answer and their\n> queries are being handled,\" says Pulkit.\n\n  \n\nDistribution is going to be the biggest moat companies have to face in the\nfuture. Given this learning, Emitrr has taken a very unique approach to\nacquire customers and build their distribution networks. They are solving the\ndistribution and customer acquisition with a B2C approach.\n\n  \n\n\"At Emitrr, we've created a community of local business owners where we help\nlocal businesses regularly through growth resources, answering their questions\nabout business in general. That has been our strategy to acquire customers. We\nlaunch capabilities/features and even acquire beta users from our own\ncommunity as the community members trust us and our offerings,\" says Anmol.\n\n## The market\n\nThe duo believes that their approach can capture the market faster. They have\ninvested Rs 4 lakh so far and have received a seed round from Axilor Ventures.\n\n  \n\n\"The fact that we are trying to create a new category has been slightly\ndifficult. We are building for customers in the US and getting access to\nprimary hand data/research is definitely a tough task sitting here in India.\nHad we been building a product in a category that already existed, it might\nhave been easier to learn from others mistakes and build something but since\nwe are building bottoms up, we need to talk to customers and understand their\nproblems very well to be able to provide a solution that actually works,\" say\nboth the founders.\n\n  \n\n**Emitrr is a SaaS platform,** and it charges a monthly subscription fee from\nall their customers. The most challenging transaction so far for them has been\nan enterprise client with well over $15 million in revenue. It was challenging\nbecause it took them over two months of conversation with that company and\nwith multiple stakeholders whom they had to convince about the [validity of\nthe product](https://yourstory.com/2020/03/zoho-freshworks-court-unicorn-saas-\ncloud).\n\n  \n\n\"Eventually, we signed the deal. Hence there is a lot of detail and work going\ninto it our sales. But the good part is that we've matured a lot during the\nprocess by getting a lot of collateral, processes and answers as a business,\"\nsays Pulkit.\n\n## Future plans\n\nIn the next 18 months, the startup hopes to achieve 500-plus paying customers,\nand add more capabilities to the product through vertical integrations.\n\n  \n\nThey currently have over 20 customers. What makes the startup unique is that\nit lets small businesses focus on the most important aspect of their business,\nand let Emitrr technology handle their calls to answer repetitive questions,\ncustomer queries, and also let customers book a service.\n\n  \n\n\"Businesses don't have to worry about missing a customer call. They can\ncontinue to grow their business, while our platform converts missed calls to\npaying opportunities,\" says Pulkit.\n\n  \n\nThe company is still going after a product market fit, and is testing out\nvarious business models. Hence, their revenues are not significant, but one\nenterprise client has paid them $100,000, and there are 20 paying customers.\nBy the end of the year, the startup hopes to achieve more than five million\ndollars in revenues.\n\n  \n\nThe product is being widely used during the coronavirus pandemic as most SMBs\nare working from home and yet can answer queries thanks to Emitrr.\n\n  \n\nOther SaaS companies trying to [approach\ncustomer](https://yourstory.com/2020/04/startup-bootstrapped-real-estate-tech-\nnear-estate-coronavirus) service include Zoho, Freshworks, and Helpshift.\n\n  \n\n**_(Edited by Kanishk Singh)_**\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

According to the **_Crossing the Digital Border_** report 2018\nby Mastercard, only 38 percent of businesses around the world could process\ninternational orders and only 33 percent could sell beyond their own borders.\nThis means more than half of all SMEs are missing out on global business\nopportunities.\n\n  \n\n> \"We believe that our job is to enable SMEs from across the world grow their\n> sales across all channels better,\" says Shayak Mazumder, Founder and CEO of\n> [Eunimart](https://www.eunimart.com/), a complete end-to-end omnichannel\n> trade and commerce management platform.\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/2d86ed30-b282-11e8-b2e7-114aea10c711/1580446753681.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nFounded in 2016 by Shayak Mazumder and Archana Shah, the startup provides\nmerchants access to markets and channels of sales and support in the form of\nshipping, warehousing, payments, etc.; operational efficiency through tools\nsuch as POS, WMS, pricing management, cataloguing, orders and inventory\nmanagement, global shipping management, returns management and e-fulfilment,\namong others along with intelligence around products, markets, competition,\nsales, etc. using Artificial Intelligence. \"By adding value to every\nstakeholder, we seek to empower the ecosystem globally and become synonymous\nwith supply aggregation and SME enablement across the globe,\" says Shayak.\n\n  \n\nEunimart uses technology in all aspects of their business - from HRMS to\nmarketing, automation, accounting and customer support to training and project\nmanagement. The objective was to reduce OPEX, increase efficiency and speed\nand derive valuable insights. In the complicated business market they worked\nin, Eunimart was looking for a highly customised solution that would provide\naccurate data, a system that could support and integrate all the flows in one\nplace.\n\n  \n\nThey explored various solutions for about a year, before they stumbled upon\n[Zoho One](https://www.zoho.com/one/), via the **' Zoho for Startups'**\nprogram. According to Shayak, it had the best pricing, a comprehensive suite\nof solutions, and the workflow management and integrations were exactly what\nthey were looking for. In 2018, they created their internal operations\nmanagement using Zoho. They onboarded all their merchants onto the platform,\nwhich enabled them to monitor every single flow and understand merchant data\nbetter.\n\n  \n\nEunimart uses [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/in/crm/) for lead generation,\n[Zoho Social](https://www.zoho.com/social/) for social media, [Zoho Sales\nIQ](https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/) for sales intelligence, [Zoho\nShowtime](https://www.zoho.com/showtime/) for training webinars, [Zoho\nBooks](https://www.zoho.com/books/), [Zoho Desk](https://www.zoho.com/desk/)\nfor customer support and [Zoho Recruit](https://www.zoho.com/recruit/) for\ntalent management.\n\n  \n\n> \"At the time, we did not have any internal application. Zoho helped us\n> automate our tasks and get a control over the workload and manage highly\n> complicated workflows to automate and assign work to people,\" says Shayak.\n\nZoho also provides them with a reports dashboard which automates every single\ncustomer report, enabling Eunimart to understand and solve each customer pain\npoint in an efficient manner.\n\n  \n\nAlthough Eunimart's dependency on Zoho reduced after launching their own\nplatform, they use Zoho more strategically now. They are automating their\ncomplete sales and marketing operations using multiple tools.\n\n\"We are now using Zoho as the mother app for the entire marketing automation\nfor collecting all data from all the tools connected to both the in-app and\nex-app funnels, and running segmentation and customer behavioural analysis,\"\nsays Shayak.\n\n  \n\n> Kuppulakshmi Krishnamoorthy, Global Head - Zoho for Startups, who has worked\n> with Eunimart for over a year, says, \"Shayak was one of the earliest users\n> of Zoho One when it was launched, and we, at Zoho, are proud when\n> entrepreneurs like him not only use our apps but also evangelise our\n> solutions. With the e-commerce scene in India and big players in it, it is\n> important to have platforms like Eunimart that help SMEs grow globally.\n> Also, here is an example where, in spite of overlaps that exist, there are\n> so many business functions that Zoho's apps can take care of. When talking\n> about e-commerce, one cannot afford to go wrong in customer analysis. Amidst\n> the obvious use cases, this one is quite different, unique, and\n> interesting.\"\n\nSince May 2016, Eunimart has come a long way and their product is now being\nvalidated by top merchants in India. They now have a team of 37 engineers and\n25 subject matter experts helping 3,000 merchants from India sell to 85\nmarkets, globally.\n\n  \n\nOn the way forward with Zoho, Shayak says they are excited to explore several\nother applications in the suite to reimagine their marketing efforts. \"This\nintegration brings us 30 percent added efficiency and customer friendliness\nhas also increased.\"\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

But most\ncompanies are not aware of this.\n\n  \n\n> \"We all had corporate jobs and realised that there are opportunities in\n> India that a lot of technology companies aren't addressing for enterprises,\"\n> say [Actlogica](http://actlogica.com/) founders Archana Anoor and Ameet\n> Ayare.\n\nThe duo has found a way to make the complex world of Actuarial Mathematics\neffectively integrate with the sometimes-complicated Information Technology\ndomain.\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/18d4ab20-d081-11e9-9775-a119527191d8/1578451559748.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nFounded in 2015, Actlogica integrates Actuarial Mathematics in their software\nproducts to provide actionable intelligence to customers. They have a B2B\nwealth management solution called Mercury Financial, and a Life Insurance\nProduct Modelling software - Avislic - for insurance companies.\n\n  \n\nActlogica believes that menial day-to-day jobs should be automated using\ntechnology so that the human mind can focus on innovating in areas that create\nmaximum impact. They evaluated several apps in the market, and chose [**Zoho\nOne**](https://www.zoho.com/one/), via the **' Zoho for Startups'** program.\nIt was a no-brainer, because although there were other solutions in the\nmarket, there were none that would seamlessly 'speak' with other parts of the\nsoftware in a business.\n\n  \n\n> \"We believe that technology is an enabler of business. A company should not\n> have to rely too much on servicing its three most important stakeholders -\n> customers, vendors and employees. And [Zoho One](https://www.zoho.com/one/)\n> helped us get there,\" says Ameet.\n\nActlogica has thus automated all aspects of servicing and managing their\nstakeholders to provide a seamless and superior experience. The customers can\nchat, raise support tickets or communicate with them directly via their apps.\nAlso, they would know when a request is going to be served, which would have\nbeen difficult to track otherwise.\n\n  \n\nTheir app is integrated with [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/in/crm/), [Zoho\nDesk](https://www.zoho.com/desk/), [Zoho\nSprints](https://www.zoho.com/sprints/) for product development and customer\nsupport. They use [Zoho Learning Management\nSystem](https://www.zoho.com/people/learning-management-system.html), [Zoho\nCliq](https://www.zoho.com/cliq/), [Zoho\nCreator](https://www.zoho.com/creator/) to ensure that their employees can\ncollaborate easily. [Zoho Social](https://www.zoho.com/social/) and [Zoho\nCampaigns](https://www.zoho.com/campaigns/) ensure that they're able to create\nand engage customers with meaningful content.\n\n  \n\n> \"Fortunately, we started using Zoho as soon as we hit production. Zoho One\n> is like an integral part of Actlogica, from offering superior customer\n> service using Zoho CRM to reacting on time with customer queries,\" says\n> Ameet.\n\nEarlier, they used to run their payroll on MS-Excel and make individual NEFT\nsalary transfers and vendor payments. It took just two people to ensure that\nthe process was error-free. But now, with the banking integration with [Zoho\nExpense](https://www.zoho.com/expense/), [Zoho\nPayroll](https://www.zoho.com/in/payroll/), [Zoho\nPeople](https://www.zoho.com/people/) and [Zoho\nBooks](https://www.zoho.com/books/), it takes one person less than 30 minutes\nto run payroll with just an OTP. Their vendors are registered, paid and\nmanaged on the ERP-like-system they created using Zoho One, which requires\nminimal or no human intervention.\n\n  \n\n> \"Actlogica is one of our premium users of Zoho One, and they currently use\n> about 12 to 13 apps from our products suite. Stories like these make for a\n> solid use case, that tell the world how tech adoption is done, and also set\n> the stage for how the future of work will look like. Founders like Archana\n> and Ameet help in making every startup out there explore Zoho's solutions to\n> run their businesses,\" says Kuppulakshmi Krishnamoorthy, Global Head - Zoho\n> for Startups.\n\nActlogica has also set up [Zoho Recruit](https://www.zoho.com/recruit/) for\ntalent management. \"This makes it easy to track applicants, leave policies,\nemployee policies, exit processes, etc. It is less than a part-time job for\none person to ensure all of these processes and policies are enforced,\" says\nAmeet.\n\n  \n\nThe founders foresee an exciting future. Their product Mercury has been\ngrowing 130 percent month-on-month from customers and assets under management\n(AUM) perspective.\n\n  \n\n> \"We've set out aggressive targets which now look achievable.

If your team needs\nto [work from home](https://www.digitaltrends.com/topic/work-from-home/) \u2014 all\nor in part \u2014 you may still need to collaborate on specific projects or\nexplanations. That means finding a video conferencing solution that lets\neveryone talk face to face, no matter where they actually are.\n\nBut you probably don\u2019t have enough time to sift through the endless online\nconferencing options to find a video solution that\u2019s right for your team.\nThat\u2019s where we can help: Using our own experience in the web conferencing\nworld, we picked up the top services you should consider, starting with the\npowerful RingCentral Meetings. Take a look at why they\u2019re great!\n\n### Further reading\n\n  * [Best video-conferencing apps](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-mobile-videoconferencing-apps/)\n  * [Best productivity apps](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-productivity-apps/)\n  * [How to use Skype](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-skype/)\n\n## RingCentral Meetings\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nRingCentral offers a _lot_ of web conferencing services, straight on through\nto large enterprises. However, even its smallest \u201cagile team\u201d option is\nimpressive \u2014 and entirely free. The service can support up to 100 participants\nand 40-minute group meetings (you need to start paying if you want longer\nmeetings). You also get unlimited one-on-one meetings if necessary, plus easy\napp and screen sharing to walk through various processes.\n\nChats, annotations, and whiteboarding as all supported, making this a great\nchoice if you need your screen for more than just seeing people\u2019s faces.\nThere\u2019s also integration with Outlook for simple scheduling. For a free\nprogram, it\u2019s very impressive just how many features you get, making\nRingCentral an ideal option for a quick transition to remote work due to\nsudden changes.\n\nLearn more at RingCentral\n\n## BlueJeans Meetings\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nBlueJeans is incredibly easy to use, adaptive, and perfect for a diverse\nworkforce that still needs to communicate for important projects. It\nintegrates with all kinds of platforms, including browsers, so compatibility\nisn\u2019t an issue. Screen sharing and recording are supported, mobile and desktop\napps can work together seamlessly, and the whole service is generally\neffortless. Management options are also very deep, allowing you to assign\nactions to people, pinpoint key discussion topics, and even replay highlights\nfor latecomers.\n\nHowever, while there is a free trial, you have to pay for using BlueJeans in\nthe long term: The lowest-tier plan supports up to 50 people and costs $10 per\nmonth for the host. For a few dollars more, you get extra compatibility with\nmessaging apps, cloud recordings for the meeting, and other extras.\n\nLearn more at BlueJeans\n\n## Intermedia AnyMeeting\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nIntermedia\u2019s AnyMeeting option is similar to BlueJeans in some ways: The\ninterface is simple and easy to quickly learn for newcomers, the mobile and\ndesktop apps work with each other smoothly, and there are plenty of\nannotation, screen-sharing, and notes options. You also get integration with\nOutlook, Gmail, [Slack, Microsoft\nTeams](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/slack-vs-teams/), and other\napps, which makes the services ideal for a freelancing team or others who may\nbe using a variety of different tools (but still need to talk to each other).\n\nThe pricing structure is especially worth noting: There\u2019s a starter tier for\nfree, but it\u2019s limited to only four web participants, so it\u2019s only suitable\nfor small teams \u2014 and there\u2019s no integration with other apps. The \u201cLite\u201d\npackage is where the utility really begins, with up to 10 participants and a\nfilled-out features package.\n\nLearn more at Intermedia\n\n## Lifesize Video Conferencing App\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nLifesize is another conferencing solution that\u2019s easy to jump into for new\nteams, and it has a great no-download option called \u201cLifesize Go\u201d that works\nright from a browser (phone or desktop) for up to eight people. The other free\noption is a more traditional tier that supports up to 25 participants with\nunlimited meetings \u2014 albeit without chat options. Paid tiers add on extra\nfeatures like chat support, more management, and better security. That makes\nLifesize a flexible solution for businesses that need a quick free service or\nlarger companies that want to start slow and scale up if they like what they\nsee.\n\nLearn more at Lifesize\n\n## Zoom Meetings & Chat\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nZoom is a scalable option that\u2019s designed for larger companies that still want\naffordable video conferencing across all their teams \u2014 plus room for larger\nconferences when necessary. The free version of the service is particularly\nimpressive, offering meetings for up to 100 participants (40-minute duration\nonly), and a variety of video call options including simultaneous screen\nshare, virtual backgrounds, active speaker display, gallery view for all\nparticipants, and more. Paid tiers add more administrative controls, cloud\nrecording, scheduling, and much more.\n\nLearn more at Zoom\n\n## Zoho Meeting\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nZoho brings excellent scheduling and management options to the table for\nbusinesses that need to make it as easy as possible for employees to join up\nand get recordings, especially if they haven\u2019t had much video conferencing\nexperience in the past. You can embed links to the conference right in emails\nand arrange for easy reminders/RSVPs so everyone stays on the same page.\nScreen sharing and in-meeting chat are both supported, too. While Zoho\nservices will show the active speaker in the meeting, they can only handle one\nvideo feed at a time for now, so the team will not be able to see anyone\nelse\u2019s face \u2014 in some cases, this can be a plus, as it\u2019s far less distracting\nfor larger groups.\n\nLearn more at Zoho\n\n####  Editors' Recommendations\n\n  * [ The best video-conferencing apps ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-mobile-videoconferencing-apps/?itm_medium=editors)\n  * [ Slack vs. Microsoft Teams ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/slack-vs-teams/?itm_medium=editors)\n  * [ The do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of video conferencing etiquette ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/dos-and-donts-of-video-conferencing-etiquette/?itm_medium=editors)\n  * [ How to record a Zoom meeting ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-record-a-zoom-meeting/?itm_medium=editors)\n  * [ How much is Microsoft Office? ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-much-microsoft-office/?itm_medium=editors)\n\n###  [ The best cheap Fitbit alternatives for workouts\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/cheap-fitbit-aternative/)\n\n11 hours ago\n\n![Amazfit Bit\nSmartwatch](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ How to increase your privacy and security in Zoom\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-increase-your-privacy-\nsecurity-zoom/)\n\n1 day ago\n\n![coronavirus crisis not ready for an online first world analysis zoom\nconference lifestyle\nimage](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ How to record a Zoom meeting\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-record-a-zoom-meeting/)\n\n4 days ago\n\n![coronavirus crisis not ready for an online first world analysis zoom\nconference lifestyle\nimage](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ Slack vs. Microsoft Teams\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/slack-vs-teams/)\n\n4 days ago\n\n![Microsoft\nTeams](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ The best laser printer deals for April 2020\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/best-laser-printer-deals/)\n\n1 day ago\n\n![brother dcp l250dw laser printer amazon deal\nmonochrome](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ When iTunes isn\u2019t enough: The best media players for PC and Mac\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-media-players/)\n\n1 day ago\n\n![best media players dusit panyakhom\n2](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ How to share your iTunes library\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-share-your-itunes-library/)\n\n23 hours ago\n\n###  [ How to control your computer from your phone\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-control-your-computer-from-\nyour-phone/)\n\n21 hours ago\n\n###  [ Dell Inspiron 15 7000 vs. Dell XPS 15\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/dell-inspiron-15-7000-vs-dell-\nxps-15/)\n\n21 hours ago\n\n###  [ AMD vs. Intel ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-vs-intel/)\n\n19 hours ago\n\n###  [ Our producer\u2019s work-from-home setup will give you desk envy\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/video-producer-work-from-home-\nsetup/)\n\n18 hours ago\n\n![video producer work from home setup dt desk\nenvy](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ How to adjust high-DPI scaling in Windows 10\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-adjust-high-dpi-scaling-in-\nwindows-10/)\n\n18 hours ago\n\n![how to adjust high-DPI scaling in Windows\n10](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ Origin\u2019s monster gaming laptop packs a 12-core Ryzen 9 desktop chip\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/origin-pc-eon-15-x-gaming-laptop-\namd-desktop-ryzen-9/)\n\n17 hours ago\n\n![Origin PC Eon\n15-X](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n###  [ How to enable hands-free voice search in Google Chrome\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-enable-ok-google-hands-free-\nvoice-search-in-google-chrome/)\n\n17 hours ago\n\n###  [ Don\u2019t miss these (rare) discounts on the MacBook Air, Surface Pro 7\n](https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/apple-macbook-air-microsoft-surface-\npro-7-deals-best-buy-home-office-sale/)\n\n16 hours ago\n\n[ ](https://www.digitaltrends.com)\n\n**Upgrade your lifestyle**  \n  \nDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with\nall the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-\nkind sneak peeks.  \n  \nDigital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.\n\nCopyright \u00a92020 Designtechnica Corporation.

But does it mean\nsuch views ought not to be aired at work?\n\nSuch a conundrum abruptly surfaced at a unicorn yesterday (Jan. 6): Tech\nbillionaire Sridhar Vembu was called a \u201cfascist\u201d and a Nazi on Twitter over\nhis plans to attend a Feb. 2 event organised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak\nSangh (RSS), the parent organisation of prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu\nnationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Several commentators even sought a boycott\nof his company, Zoho, a software service provider based in southern India\u2019s\nChennai.\n\nVembu, often described as \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201csimple,\u201d refused to engage with his\n\u201c[attackers\u201d on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/svembu/status/1214109874826534913?s=20). The\n52-year-old enjoys a healthy reputation in the business community for building\nan IT empire without any VC funding and for employing an army of [high school\ngraduates](https://qz.com/india/1029316/zoho-corporation-is-building-a-\nmillion-dollar-empire-with-an-army-of-high-school-graduates-in-india/).\n\nHowever, Monday was simply not his day.\n\nWhile he drew flak over the RSS event, a [Medium\npost](https://medium.com/@saravanaraja_17675/dear-kannan-gopinathan-i-quit-\nzoho-for-the-same-reason-where-do-we-go-from-here-6ace2dba7a2a) from last year\nby a former Zoho employee resurfaced on social media. Published under the name\nSaravana Raja, the article claimed Vembu was himself hostile towards the\nwriter for criticising the RSS on the intranet.\n\n> As expected, there were some strong responses from right-wing supporters but\n> Sridhar\u2019s reply came like a bolt out of the blue. He said my post \u201ccrossed\n> an important line to spread historical falsehood and calumny.\u201d He went\n> further and said, \u201cYou cannot just say anything here in the name of free\n> speech\u2026 Go build your own platform to spread your values\u2026 I will not fire\n> you, but I do have strong disagreement with you and I am asking you \u2018Why do\n> you still choose to work here, when your value system is so much at odds\n> with what company and its CEO believe in?\u2019\u2026\u201d\n\nThe employee says he chose to quit. Zoho has not responded to Quartz\u2019s emails\non this matter.\n\nHowever, should one talk about one\u2019s views on national politics on company-\nwide intranet? And should bosses and founders air their own political views so\npublicly?\n\n## Argumentative _desis_\n\nThe answer to the first question is a resounding yes.\n\nIndians are among the most [overworked\nemployees](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-\nsick-of-office-politics/) on the planet, and end up spending most of their\nwaking hours in office. In such a scenario, it is impossible for political\nviews to remain bottled up for too long among colleagues.\n\nUtkarsh Amitabh, the founder of peer mentoring group Network Capital and a\n[Quartz Pro](https://qz.com/india/1767826/meet-the-new-quartz-india-pros-\nincluding-ajit-mohan-anand-mahindra-and-barkha-dutt/), says nearly 65% of the\nmembers of his community of elite professionals in India want to do it. In\nfact, discussing politics with co-workers can even have surprising benefits.\n\n\u201cLearning how to talk about politics in a productive manner can help you\nmanage other difficult conversations at work, including peer performance\nreviews or disagreements over strategy and policy,\u201d Joseph Grenny, co-author\nof Crucial Conversations, told [Harvard Business\nReview](https://hbr.org/2016/09/should-you-talk-about-politics-at-work).\n\nYet, there can be horrible consequences as well. In the current political\nclimate, there is a strong tendency among urban Indians to demonise those with\ndifferent views. Up to [35% Indians believe](https://qz.com/india/1565588/bjp-\ncongresss-urban-backers-dont-want-to-talk-to-each-other/) that those who hold\npolitical views opposed to their own are not worth having a conversation with,\naccording to a recent Ipsos poll. The respondents were educated and affluent.\n\n\u201cEarlier people were much more uninhibited and spontaneous while discussing\npolitics in office,\u201d says Aditya Mishra, founder & CEO of Ciel HR Services.\n\u201cNow they are scared and don\u2019t want trouble with the boss.\u201d\n\nSouring the relationship with a boss or alpha team member can result in\nanything from an unproductive day to job loss.\n\nSome professionals share their opinions on Instagram and those who disagree\ntend to avoid bringing up their points of view at work these days, an internal\ncommunication executive at an IT firm tells me. \u201cI have seen colleagues are\nmore confident to talk about Modi or BJP when they are absolutely sure there\nis no Muslim or beef lover in the company WhatsApp group,\u201d she adds.\n\n## Stay calm and be a leader\n\nAs for the question on the boss\u2019s role, neutrality is key to avoid emotional\nflare-ups in these polarised times.\n\n\u201cLeaders in an organisation must promote tolerance towards\ndiversity\u2014especially now,\u201d says Mishra. \u201cAs a company, you are serving\ncustomers from various faiths and communities, and bosses have to make a\nconscious effort to stand by diversity.\u201d\n\nMaybe that is something Vembu can do.\n\n _Send story ideas to[dmadhok@qz.com](mailto:dmadhok@qz.com) or tweet to\n[@dikshamadhok](https://twitter.com/dikshamadhok?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)._\n\n[![Quartz Daily Brief](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n[\n\n##### Quartz Daily Brief\n\n](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n##### Subscribe to the Daily Brief, our morning email with news and insights\nyou need to understand our changing world.\n\nSign me up\n\n[Narendra Modi](/re/narendra-modi/), [\u202aIndia\u202c](/re/%e2%80%aaindia%e2%80%ac/),\n[BJP](/re/bjp/), [diversity](/re/diversity/), [leadership](/re/leadership/)\n\n[\ud83d\udcac\\+ Add your insights](/co/2879754/)\n\n[](mailto:?subject=Quartz%20India%3A%20How%20to%20talk%20about%20Modi%20with%20your%20boss&body=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1780633%2Fhow-\nto-talk-about-modi-at-\nwork%2F%0A%0AIt%20is%20critical%20for%20a%20boss%20or%20team%20leader%20to%20stay%20neutral%20and%20extinguish%20any%20emotional%20flare-\nups. \"Share via\nemail\")[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1780633%2Fhow-\nto-talk-about-modi-at-work%2F&caption=qz.com%20%7C%20By%20Diksha%20Madhok\n\"Share via\nfacebook\")[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1780633%2F&text=How%20to%20talk%20about%20Modi%20with%20your%20boss&via=qzindia\n\"Share via twitter\")\n\n[](/)\n\nNews for the next era, not the next hour\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\nDiscover\n\n  * [Membership](/become-a-member/)\n  * [Emails](/emails/)\n  * [Latest](/latest/)\n  * [Popular](/popular/)\n  * [Featured](/featured/)\n  * [Obsessions](/obsessions/)\n\nTopics\n\n  * [Emerging industries](/topic/emerging-industries/)\n  * [Economics](/topic/finance-and-economics/)\n  * [Lifestyle](/topic/lifestyle/)\n  * [Politics](/topic/politics-and-policy/)\n  * [Science](/topic/science-and-human-behavior/)\n  * [Tech](/topic/tech-and-communications/)\n  * [Work](/topic/work-and-management/)\n\nMore\n\n  * [Search](/search/)\n  * [Careers](/careers/)\n  * [About us](/about/)\n  * [Contact us](/about/#contact)\n  * [Help center](https://help.qz.com/en/)\n  * [Send us tips](/tips/)\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\n[Download our app](/app/?pid=socialshare&af_dp=zebroid%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ffooter)\n\n  * [Site map](/sitemap/)\n  * [Terms & conditions](/about/terms-conditions/)\n  * [Privacy policy](/about/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Do not sell my info](/about/do-not-sell/)\n  * [Ethics and advertising agreements](/about/ethicsandadvertisingguidelines/)\n  * [Community agreements](/about/community-agreements/)\n\nQuartz is owned by [Uzabase](https://www.uzabase.com/en/), the business\nintelligence and media company. \u00a9 2020 Quartz Media, Inc.

This news comes at a time when Zoho is growing\nconsiderably. The company now has 10 data centers around the globe, which\nsupport more than 45 different applications that help businesses located in\nmore than 180 countries. With the recent launch of\n[Catalyst](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoho.com%2Fcatalyst%2F&esheet=52123876&newsitemid=20191106005512&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Catalyst&index=1&md5=f7f0b382d193e051dd8650667b2ddc7f), Zoho\ncontinues to be a major player in the developer space as well, offering no-\ncode, low-code, and pro-code applications. As more and more people around the\nworld turn to Zoho for their business needs, the company is redoubling its\nefforts to provide the best, most unified platform, services, and applications\nin the industry.\n\n> With this in mind, Zoho has rearchitected its content collaboration platform\n> from the ground up, optimizing it for teams and businesses. WorkDrive now\n> provides the underlying document management across all Zoho business\n> applications, allowing for unified search, single storage, contextual\n> integration, as well as many other vertically integrated capabilities.\n> Businesses seek to go beyond storage today and need enterprise-grade\n> solutions in areas like multi-level security, compliance, and audit control.\n> The unit of work is no longer the individual, but the team. Sharing and\n> collaboration must be implicit in workflows and business processes, rather\n> than be patched onto solutions that originated as consumer and single-person\n> models. WorkDrive is integrated into the platform, services, and\n> applications layers of the Zoho technology stack and incorporates\n> capabilities like virus detection, encryption, image processing, and other\n> AI tools in the proper business context.\n\n\"A content collaboration platform must understand the context of the documents\nit stores. A proposal may turn into a sales contract and then into a service\nlevel agreement. In this case, the customer engagement went from prospecting\nto sales to service management. By understanding the connections between these\ndocuments\u2014hence their underlying context\u2014a content collaboration platform can\nconnect and engage the relevant people,\" said Vijay Sundaram, Zoho's Chief\nStrategy Officer. \"WorkDrive creates a common, unified file system across all\nbusiness processes, so the business context is easier to understand and\npreserve, making the system significantly more valuable to the customer. This\nunique type of a solution can only come from a vendor who also offers the\nbusiness applications.\"\n\nZoho is also announcing its revamped\n[Workplace](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoho.com%2Fworkplace%2F%3Fsrc%3Dtop-\nheader&esheet=52123876&newsitemid=20191106005512&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Workplace&index=2&md5=471895dedbda38089ee3c8ce30f80a1b) suite of\nproductivity applications, which includes Cliq, Notebook, Connect, Writer,\nSheet, Show, Showtime, Mail, Meeting, and WorkDrive. Among other new\ncapabilities, Workplace now features an integrated app dashboard that houses\ncustomizable widgets that display information from each of the nine apps\nincluded in the suite. Here are some of the key features of WorkDrive and the\nrevamped Workplace suite:\n\n**WorkDrive for Better Team Management and Collaboration**\n\n  * WorkDrive comes with a built-in Zoho Office suite (Writer, Sheet, and Show). \n  * WorkDrive introduces Team Folders, a shared workplace with role-based member permissions for cross-team collaboration and storage. \n  * WorkDrive deploys virus scanning, encryption, and WAN acceleration at the platform level, thereby strengthening all Zoho services and applications built on top of it. \n  * WorkDrive introduces image, video, and document conversion services. \n  * WorkDrive is integrated with Zia, Zoho's AI assistant, providing unified search as well as OCR in applications such as Zoho Notebook. \n  * WorkDrive provides administrators advanced analytics, data administration, and granular access controls. \n  * WorkDrive has an advanced external file-sharing feature, allowing users to collaborate with external stakeholders while maintaining control of the files. \n  * External users who have edit permission can add files to a shared folder or edit shared Zoho Office Suite files. \n  * WorkDrive brings businesses advanced team management capabilities, allowing administrators to manage settings at the team and Team Folder levels. \n\n**A New Workplace for a New Workforce**\n\n  * **Zoho Sheet** is integrated with Zia, Zoho's AI assistant, giving customers automatic insight into their data, data cleansing, and even the ability to scan data tables within images and convert them into spreadsheets. \n  * **Zoho Cliq** allows users to build bots, custom message actions, commands, and schedulers that connect with other workplace tools to centralize and consolidate data. \n  * **Zoho Writer** gives business users the power to create documents with fillable fields.

Users can deliver the merged documents via email or send the filled document for signature. \n  * **Zoho ShowTime** offers on-demand training with ticketing and course completion certificates, allowing trainers to reach customers across time zones and provide flexible learning. \n  * **Zoho Mail** features email retention and eDiscovery whereby admins can retain organization-wide emails for a specified period and easily search across those retained emails and retrieve relevant information. \n  * **Zoho Notebook** is enhanced by Zia, Zoho's AI assistant. Users can employ the Ask Zia feature to save content to Notebook, search for notes, set reminders, and share notes with voice commands. \n  * **Zoho Meeting** has added new moderator controls, including the ability to lock meetings, switch presenters, and mute or remove participants. \n\n**Customer Statements**\n\n\"Expect Best is a web development and digital marketing agency that works with\nover 300 customers. Therefore, we need to stay organized, efficient, and be\nable to work with our clients at every stage of the projects. Zoho's Workdrive\nhas allowed us to do all this and more,\" said Alex Dibben, Managing Director\nof Expect Best Ltd. \"We started with Zoho One and were impressed by how much\nit helped our business that we decided to also integrate Workdrive. Workdrive\nhas given us a huge amount of storage space and increased our ability to\njuggle our many clients and their projects with ease.\"\n\n\"Prior to Workdrive, we had been finding it hard to manage client files and\ncoordinate internal and external programs, we also were using multiple\nplatforms which affected our collaboration abilities and decreased security,\"\nsaid Bob Sullivan, Co-Founder of Vector Solutions. \"When we switched to\nWorkDrive, Zoho showed us how one application can change our efficiency\ntremendously. One of our favorite aspects is being able to create folders\nwhere our clients can see only their secure documents while we can see\neverything from all clients. It improved our collaboration and work ability\ngreatly.\"\n\n**Pricing & Availability**\n\nWorkDrive is available starting at $2 per user/month. Zoho Workplace is\navailable starting at $3 per user/month.\n\n**About Zoho**\n\nWith 45+ apps in nearly every major business category, including sales,\nmarketing, customer support, accounting and back office operations, and an\narray of productivity and collaboration tools, Zoho Corporation is one of the\nworld's most prolific software companies.\n\nZoho is privately held and profitable with more than 8,000 employees.

But you're not entirely sure\nwhat you want. You are buried in choices. You read reports like [this recent\none](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-best-crm-software-quadrant-\nscore-of-2020-announced-by-360quadrants-301012393.html\n\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-best-crm-software-quadrant-\nscore-of-2020-announced-by-360quadrants-301012393.html\") from application\nmarketplace 360Quadrants of the \"best CRM software\" and you're still not sure.\n\nSo let me help you clear things up. My company implements CRM software. In\nfact, we implement (full disclosure) some of the products - Salesforce, Zoho\nand Microsoft Dynamics - listed below. We love those products but the fact is\nI would also love to sell every one of the products listed below. We just\ndon't have the bandwidth to do it all. Rest assured, if you're working with\nthe right people and partners and are willing to make the investment, any one\nof the ten \u201cvisionary leaders\u201d CRM products listed on the 360Quadrants report\nbelow would be completely fine for your business.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that there aren't some differences that separates these\nchoices. The vendors may argue with my opinions below. But when prospective\nCRM buyers \u2013 mostly from small and mid-sized companies - are looking at these\noptions this is usually the advice I give them.\n\nToday In: [Entrepreneurs](https://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs)\n\n  * [\n\n### How AI And Data Science Are Helping To Understand And Tackle COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriacollins/2020/04/08/how-ai-and-data-\nscience-are-helping-to-understand-and-tackle-covid-19/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Meet Patricia Bright: Social Media Maven And Founder Of The Break Platform\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommywilliams1/2020/04/08/meet-patricia-bright-\nsocial-media-maven-and-founder-of-the-break-platform/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Bangladesh\u2019s New Generation Of Women-Led Labor Unions Confronts The\nPandemic\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2020/04/07/bangladeshs-new-generation-\nof-women-led-labor-unions-confronts-the-pandemic/)\n\n[ **Freshworks**](http://www.freshworks.com/ \"http://www.freshworks.com/\") \\-\nYou want CRM as part of a suite of business applications.\n\nFreshworks is part of a trend (see Zoho) of companies offering CRM modules\nthat are part of a growing suite of applications that they hope their clients\ncan rely on entirely to run their businesses. Freshsales is Freshworks' CRM\napplication and the company offers other modules that do everything from help\ndesk and analytics to project management and collaboration.\n\n[**HubSpot**](http://www.hubspot.com/ \"http://www.hubspot.com/\") **** \\- You\nwant a strong marketing application that has good CRM capabilities.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then HubSpot is great marketing automation application for\nsmall and medium sized businesses with capable CRM features. We recommend this\nto clients where marketing managers are driving the discussion and when there\nare good internal marketing resources to use it. If you don\u2019t have a marketing\ndepartment, or even a dedicated marketing person, this may not be the best\noption.\n\n[**Insightly**](http://www.insightly.com/ \"http://www.insightly.com/\") \\- You\nwant an affordable CRM system with an intuitive user interface.\n\nFor the past few years, Insightly has grown in popularity due to its easy to\nuse and affordable CRM capabilities. To me, Insightly is a reliable and\nworkable CRM product that offers a similar feature set of other competitors.\nIt doesn't have a suite of applications like Freshworks or Zoho, but the\ncompany has recently introduced marketing automation to its mix and I know of\na number of their customers that enjoy Insightly's unique user interface.\n\n[**Microsoft Dynamics 365**](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/\n\"https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/\") \\- You want Microsoft.\n\nWhen a buyer tells me they're a Microsoft shop then this is always my first\nrecommendation. Because it makes sense to insert a Microsoft-built CRM\napplication into your existing Microsoft environment, specifically if you want\nto leverage Office, Outlook and other Microsoft tools in your business.\n\n[**Nimble**](http://www.nimble.com/ \"http://www.nimble.com/\") \\- You want\nMicrosoft but you can't afford Microsoft.\n\nDynamics 365 can get a little pricey for smaller companies. So welcome to\nNimble. Nimble does a great job leveraging social media and communications.\nBut it's best (and most recent) strength is that it's a simple and more user\nfriendly solution for smaller (under 10 users) companies who want a Microsoft-\noriented solution because it's currently the only small business CRM\napplication being sold through the Microsoft partner channel other than the\ncompany's existing CRM offerings, which are built for larger companies.\n\n[**Pipedrive**](http://www.pipedrive.com/ \"http://www.pipedrive.com/\") \\- You\nwant a sales tool.\n\nPipedrive is the anti-suite of CRM. Instead of trying to please everyone the\napplication is really focused on helping salespeople close more deals. There's\nno accounting, marketing automation, project management or service desk\nfeatures. It's just about sales. To that end, its opportunity, sales and lead\nmanagement features, along with its powerful reporting tools, are advanced and\nwell suited for a customer that just wants a state of the art sales automation\ntool to help grow revenues.\n\n[**PipelineDeals**](http://www.pipelinedeals.com/\n\"http://www.pipelinedeals.com/\") **** \\- You want a sales tool and maybe you\ndon't like Pipedrive.\n\nSee Pipedrive. But if you\u2019re not sold on that option then this application,\nlike it's closely-named competitor, is also focused on managing salespeople's\npipelines. Like Pipedrive, it integrates with many other cloud based\napplications, includes self-customizing workflows and developer tools to build\nmore specialized processes.\n\n[**Salesforce**](http://www.salesforce.com/ \"http://www.salesforce.com/\") \u2013\nYou don\u2019t want to get fired.\n\nSalesforce is the BMW of CRM. It\u2019s corporate stock ticker is CRM. Salesforce\nhas a wildly passionate community and integrations with just about every\napplication out there. It has the best brand recognition and you\u2019re unlikely\nto be criticized for choosing it. Unless you don\u2019t need all of its features.\nBecause that\u2019s the catch: Salesforce can be expensive. But if you're willing\nto pay the higher monthly fees, consulting costs and development time then\nyou'll be able to accomplish whatever you need with Salesforce.\n\n[**Zendesk**](http://www.zendesk.com/ \"http://www.zendesk.com/\") \\- You want a\nservice application with CRM features.\n\nSome CRMs are marketing applications with CRM features. Some are straight\nsales applications. Zendesk is at its core an excellent service management\napplication. That means managing tickets, queues, issues, cases, problems and\nother issues that affect a company's customer service. But Zendesk is also\nexpanding into CRM with its recent aquisition of Base CRM. So if you're the\nkind of company that wants a great service desk application that happens to\nhave CRM capabilities, then this is a good one to consider.\n\n[**Zoho**](http://www.zoho.com/ \"http://www.zoho.com/\") \u2013 See Freshworks.\n\nYou like Salesforce but you don't have the budget. Plus, you're a smaller\norganization that won't likely use 80 percent of Salesforce's features.  You\nalso want to expand your CRM to include accounting, project management, HR and\nother business functions and you want to do it all on one platform, if\npossible. Zoho is the next best option to Salesforce and why I always\nrecommend it to smaller companies that are looking for a Salesforce solution\nbut don\u2019t want to pay for a Salesforce solution. And the fact that it comes as\npart of a suite of other business applications is also a big plus.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m leaving out a lot of other great CRMs here, mainly because there\u2019s plenty\nof overlap and these were the ten \u201cvisionary leaders\u201d according to\n360Quadrants.  My advice, however is not to get caught up in the software.\nThese applications compete against each other and are matching features\nquickly. Spend more time researching the company, its partners and its\ncommunity. In the end, it will be those factors that will be determine whether\nor not you succeed with your CRM software or not.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@genemarks) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genemarks).
