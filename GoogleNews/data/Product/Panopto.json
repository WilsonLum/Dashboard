significant expansion of its integration\nwith Zoom Video Communications, Inc. The enhanced integration automatically\nroutes scheduled classes held via Zoom to each student's consolidated,\npersonalized library of learning materials in Panopto. Furthermore, global\nbusinesses may now use Panopto's automatic transcription features to search\nZoom meeting recordings in 14 languages.\n\n**Secure distribution of Zoom classes to enrolled students  \n** Universities have long used Panopto as the learning platform for lecture\ncapture and \"flipped classroom\" teaching scenarios. Until now, interactive\nclass discussions held via Zoom were managed under largely isolated workflows,\nmaking it difficult for students to review their instructional material across\nmany classes.\n\nPanopto creates a YouTube-like video library for each student which mirrors\ntheir personal course structure. Each video view is securely authenticated\nthrough a role based permissions structure synchronized to the school's\nidentity management platform. Students can instantly search through every word\nspoken to them or shown on screen across their entire semester and play back\nthe key moments when instructors covered a topic of interest.\n\nUniversity administrators may enable the automatic routing of courses to each\nstudents' Panopto libraries through a simple, one-time setup. Panopto uses\nLearning Tools Interoperability (LTI), an industry standard, to tie Zoom\nsessions to enrollment data. Panopto's platform is architected for high\napplication, infrastructure and operational security, leveraging proprietary\nmethods to harden against IP spoofing as well as DDoS and MITM attacks.\n\n\"I hear from university CIOs every day about the challenges they face as they\nmove their operations online,\" said Eric Burns, CEO, Panopto. \"These busy\nadministrators need features like Panopto's LTI mapping for Zoom to rapidly\nscale online learning with minimal IT overhead.\"\n\n**Transcribe Zoom meetings in 14 Languages  \n** Organizations increasingly see productivity benefits from using meeting\ntranscripts for search and reference purposes, but Zoom only offers a\ntranscript in English by default.

Fully integrated and\ncertified with the Panopto\u2122 video platform, Maevex 6020 provides users with\nbest-in-class, multi-channel live streaming and video recording in a powerful,\ncompact, and autonomous appliance. This plug-and-play encoder/recorder\nrequires a simple one-time setup and configuration, ensuring the fastest and\neasiest turnaround for organizations and schools to get online from any\nlocation.\n\n**Deployment-friendly, on and off premises  \n**In an effort to maintain business and instructional continuity due to\nCOVID-19, enterprises and universities are expanding their services by\nmigrating in-person communications, trainings, and teachings to online live\nstreaming and video on demand (VOD). Maevex 6020 streamlines this transition\nby seamlessly enabling high-quality recordings and webcasts from limited-\naccess conference rooms, lecture halls, high-performance laboratories, and\npurpose-built studios. As a non-Windows dedicated appliance\u2014and in a form\nfactor as little as a quarter of the size of other comparable products on the\nmarket\u2014Maevex 6020 is a highly reliable device that can also deliver\nbroadcast-quality video from off-site locations including an employee\u2019s or\nprofessor\u2019s office or home. In addition, recordings are available immediately\nafter the session and as part of a larger, secure, and searchable video\nlibrary for later review, reference, and/or training purposes.\n\n\u201cMatrox\u2019s initiative is a direct response to the challenges that institutions\nare currently facing during these unprecedented times,\u201d said Sean Gorman, COO\nof Panopto. \u201cWe share the same belief in helping organizations and schools as\nthey look to quickly and swiftly move their business and instructional\ncommunications online. The Matrox and Panopto partnership provides a\ndependable, easy-to-use video solution to offer active and ongoing support to\nemployees, faculty, and students, whether it\u2019s through meetings, live events,\nhow-to videos/trainings, lectures, and/or tutorials.\u201d\n\n\u201cDealing with remote productivity for organizations during the COVID-19\npandemic is demonstrating that private networks and the cloud are handling\nmassive concurrent live and on-demand quality media even during this surge in\ntraffic,\u201d said Samuel Recine, vice president of sales for the Americas and\nAsia Pacific in the Matrox AV/IT Group. \u201cThese working models will have\nenduring benefits to organizations, and Matrox predicts that the corresponding\nsurge in the video assets created by organizations will increasingly benefit\nfrom advanced video management systems, such as Panopto. Alongside Panopto\u2019s\nown 90-day complimentary access program, the Maevex 6020 trial is a great and\neasy way to get started.\u201d\n\n**Availability  \n**The free 90-day trial of the Maevex 6020 Remote Recorder is available until\nJuly 1st, 2020.

**Secure, Automatic Zoom Recording and 90-day Free Access for Businesses,\nUniversities, Colleges and Schools Will Enable Employees and Students to\nContinue Learning and Working Remotely**\n\nSEATTLE, March 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Panopto, a leading video knowledge\nplatform provider, today announced two new initiatives to assist businesses\nand educators affected by COVID-19.  First, for three months, organizations\nnew to Panopto may use Panopto Cloud at no cost to capture and stream\nunlimited amounts of video.  Second, Panopto has launched a new workflow that\nhelps administrators and instructors automatically record and intelligently\nshare recurring Zoom Video Communications meetings with attendees or students.\nBusinesses and educational institutions can go to[\nwww.panopto.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2753570-1&h=3245086603&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.panopto.com%2F&a=%C2%A0www.panopto.com)\nto sign up and get started immediately.\n\n[![Zoom cloud recording integrated into\nPanopto.](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![Zoom cloud recording\nintegrated into\nPanopto.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u_8ENw4S35VAwj2CDxR7VQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/51626f1ddebe1d9ff7899b56210f6651)Zoom\ncloud recording integrated into\nPanopto.More](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1134664/Zoom_cloud_recording_Panopto.html)\n\nPreparations for the spread of the coronavirus are accelerating, and\nincreasing numbers of organizations are transitioning from in-person to online\noperations.  Many universities and businesses affected by COVID-19 are\nreplacing live lectures and meetings with recurring Zoom sessions.  Panopto's\nenhanced Zoom integration allows meeting schedulers and course instructors to\nautomatically and securely distribute searchable recordings of these online\nevents to students and colleagues.  When used with learning management systems\nlike those provided by Blackboard, D2L, Instructure, and Moodle, Panopto's\nenhanced Zoom recording workflow can automatically deliver these videos to\nstudents who can't attend live due to illness or the need to support family\nmembers.\n\nSimilarly, many global companies have already been increasing the use of video\nstreaming platforms to support their employees with recordings of online\nmeetings and training sessions, and the onset of the coronavirus has\naccelerated this trend.  Organizations that depend on the rapid exchange of\ninformation and expertise use Panopto to make it easier for attendees to\nreference key moments in meetings or for people who missed the sessions to\nwatch at their convenience.\n\nThis transition to online-first models has increased leaders' focus on\nsupporting their employees with easy access to recordings, but businesses need\nto ensure recordings will be automatically and securely shared with exactly\nthe right audience.  Some of the world's largest and most respected companies,\nsuch as Ingersoll-Rand, Synaptics, Radisson Hotels, and Valvoline have chosen\nPanopto's video knowledge platform as their solution for consolidating\nrecorded meetings, live events, how-to videos, and video training into a\nsecure, searchable library of corporate knowledge.\n\n\"Around the world, institutions of all kinds are closing their doors and\nrapidly moving their operations online,\" said Eric Burns, CEO, Panopto. \"To\nsucceed in this process, they will need a dependable, easy-to-use video\nknowledge solution that can scale to match exponential increases in demand.\nPanopto stands ready to provide our services to these organizations at no cost\nfor three months.\"\n\nPanopto provides a secure, searchable video platform for more than 1,000\ncompanies and universities worldwide, including Brown University, Cornell\nUniversity, Georgetown University, Imperial College London, Monash University,\nNational University of Singapore, Northwestern University, Oxford University,\nand the University of Washington.  Fortune 500 companies that depend on\nPanopto to keep their employees productive include Dana, Freeport Minerals,\nGeneral Dynamics, John Hancock, Kimberly-Clark, New York Life, Tableau, and\nVMWare.\n\nStory continues\n\n **About Panopto  \n** Panopto helps businesses and universities create searchable video libraries\nof their institutional knowledge.  Since 2007, the company has been a pioneer\nin video capture software, video content management systems, and inside-video\nsearch technology.  Today, Panopto's video platform is the largest repository\nof expert learning videos in the world.  Headquartered in Seattle, with\noffices in Pittsburgh, London, Hong Kong, and Sydney, Panopto has received\nindustry recognition for its innovation, rapid growth, and company culture.\nFor more

all\nplaces](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nTerry Swanson, a UW Earth and Space Sciences professor, turns to Twitch for\nhis online lectures.\n\n[Mo Tilmo](https://www.dailyuw.com/users/profile/Mo%20Tilmo)\n\nClasses have been online for a week, and principal lecturer Terry Swanson has\nhad to get creative to switch his ESS 101 class online. In an effort to reach\nall 350 enrolled students, Swanson has supplemented his Zoom lectures with the\nonline streaming site Twitch to publicly live stream his classes and field\ntrips.\n\nTwitch is a service most commonly used by online gamers to livestream their\ngaming sessions. It\u2019s publicly available, has no viewership limit, can easily\nscreen share, and has an interactive live chat. While these features are\nperfect for a Fortnite stream, Swanson has been using the platform to keep his\nlarge lecture class live and interactive.\n\nIn early March, the UW paid for a university-wide [Zoom\nPro](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_b84ed55a-5f55-11ea-9330-ef702786cff2.html)\nmembership, but Zoom caps its meetings at 300 participants. Some introductory\ncourses, like Swanson\u2019s ESS 101 class, exceed that limit. Although the\nuniversity\u2019s recommendation for these cases is to do Panopto recordings,\nSwanson didn\u2019t want to miss out on the hands-on learning that comes with live\nteaching.\n\nHis son, who works at Qualcomm Incorporated, a telecommunications company,\nrecommended that he try Twitch. Although unconventional, Swanson said that\nstreaming on Twitch to supplement Zoom has allowed him to reach more people\nwithout having to sacrifice a live lecture for a Panopto recording.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no interaction \u2014 there\u2019s nothing \u2014 when recording canned lectures and\nI just did not want to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of being in the\nclassroom.\u201d\n\nSince his lectures are available for free online, students are tuning in who\naren\u2019t enrolled in the course. On April 3, over 2,000 people logged on for his\nTwitch stream in addition to enrolled students who could log in via Zoom.\n\nOne of these students is Cameron McElmurry, a third year undergraduate student\nmajoring in public health. He said he had used Twitch occasionally to keep up\nwith streamers and YouTubers, and that Swanson\u2019s use of Twitch prompted him to\nwatch the lectures. He said geology is a subject that interests him, and the\nlive public lectures gave him the ability to explore the subject, albeit\nwithout getting credit for the course.\n\n#### More COVID-19 Coverage\n\n[ _To weed or not to weed: Local budtenders weigh health concerns with showing\nup to\nshifts_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_e325db8c-77ad-11ea-87a7-5f2da08ebfa0.html)\n\n[_Nonprofits bring childcare relief during coronavirus-induced school\nclosures_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_2ca4dbf6-77ad-11ea-88bd-17fd8bf70796.html)\n\n[_Congress suspends federal student loan payments without penalty amid\ncoronavirus_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_62e109bc-77b5-11ea-943f-bf6f7e6b3057.html)\n\n[_COVID-19 has UW custodial staff taking additional sanitation\nmeasures_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_81791520-754b-11ea-8b6f-ef7235c19737.html)\n\n_[Students, instructors face threats and hateful speech as Zoom meetings\nget'bombed'](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_9001e110-7471-11ea-9bf2-73a86a59e63d.html)_\n\nHis experience had led him to believe that more classes at the UW should be\noffered online.\n\n\u201cIf more professors were doing this then more people would have access to\nhigher level stuff that was taught currently,\u201d McElmurry said. \u201cI think that\u2019s\nsomething that would be really good to work towards.\u201d\n\nSwanson said that he considered the unfairness to students paying for the\ncourse, but still believes that paying students are getting their money\u2019s\nworth. A self-described \u201copen-source person,\u201d Swanson gives exams and\nmaterials to the entire class so that some students don\u2019t gain an unfair\nadvantage over each other. He cited other universities like MIT, who regularly\npublish their lectures for the general public to access.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a public university, anyone and their dog could walk into my Kane Hall\nlecture and sit down and listen to it, and I would not have a clue who was in\nthere,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they can\u2019t do is they don\u2019t get to do the laboratories,\nthey don\u2019t have the same kind of interaction with their professor.\u201d\n\nThe switch to online learning hasn\u2019t been seamless for Swanson, who has\nconcerns about how his field trips next week will run. And although he hasn\u2019t\ndealt with the more insidious eavesdroppers, like those who [\u201cbombed\u201d large\nZoom lectures with hateful\nlanguage](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_9001e110-7471-11ea-9bf2-73a86a59e63d.html)\nin the first week of classes, he has dealt with inappropriate messages\nappearing on his Twitch chat box.\n\nStreaming from Whidbey Island, he said he enlisted some help from his home\noffice to monitor the public Twitch chat, keep it clean, and field questions\nfrom students.\n\n\u201cMy wife is with me as my field assistant \u2014 and my dog \u2014 and my wife can relay\nthe chat questions and that way we can be right there in the field while\nthey\u2019re looking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best we can do without being with them in\nthe field.\u201d\n\nESS 101 streams live on Twitch Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30 PST at\n[twitch.tv/tswanrocks](https://www.twitch.tv/tswanrocks).\n\n_Reach reporter Emma Scher at[news@dailyuw.com](mailto:news@dailyuw.com).\nTwitter: @emma_scherr_\n\n _Like what you\u2019re reading?

Maevex 6020 streamlines this transition\nby seamlessly enabling high-quality recordings and webcasts from limited-\naccess conference rooms, lecture halls, high-performance laboratories, and\npurpose-built studios. As a non-Windows dedicated appliance\u2014and in a form\nfactor as little as a quarter of the size of other comparable products on the\nmarket\u2014Maevex 6020 is a highly reliable device that can also deliver\nbroadcast-quality video from off-site locations including an employee\u2019s or\nprofessor\u2019s office or home. In addition, recordings are available immediately\nafter the session and as part of a larger, secure, and searchable video\nlibrary for later review, reference, and/or training purposes.\n\n\u201cMatrox\u2019s initiative is a direct response to the challenges that institutions\nare currently facing during these unprecedented times,\u201d said **Sean Gorman,\nCOO of Panopto**. \u201cWe share the same belief in helping organizations and\nschools as they look to quickly and swiftly move their business and\ninstructional communications online. The Matrox and Panopto partnership\nprovides a dependable, easy-to-use video solution to offer active and ongoing\nsupport to employees, faculty, and students, whether it\u2019s through meetings,\nlive events, how-to videos/trainings, lectures, and/or tutorials.\u201d\n\n\u201cDealing with remote productivity for organizations during the COVID-19\npandemic is demonstrating that private networks and the cloud are handling\nmassive concurrent live and on-demand quality media even during this surge in\ntraffic,\u201d said **Samuel Recine, vice president of sales for the Americas and\nAsia Pacific in the Matrox AV/IT Group**. \u201cThese working models will have\nenduring benefits to organizations, and Matrox predicts that the corresponding\nsurge in the video assets created by organizations will increasingly benefit\nfrom advanced video management systems, such as Panopto. Alongside Panopto\u2019s\nown 90-day complimentary access program, the Maevex 6020 trial is a great and\neasy way to get started.\u201d\n\n**Availability  \n**The free 90-day trial of the Maevex 6020 Remote Recorder is available until\nJuly 1st, 2020.\n\n  \n\n## Latest Headlines\n\n[Facebook's Melissa Lawton on Social Media Content Innovation in the\nCoronavirus Era](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/facebooks-melissa-\nlawton-on-social-media-content-creativity-and-innovation-in-the-coronavirus-\nera/)[Seen on Screen: NBA Launches _#NBATogether With Ernie Johnson_ Digital\nShow; NFL Network Ramps Up Draft\nContent](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/seen-on-screen-nba-launches-\nnbatogether-with-ernie-johnson-digital-show-nfl-network-ramps-up-draft-\ncontent/)[NBA 2K League Goes Virtual for \u2018Three for All Showdown\u2019\nProduction](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/nba-2k-league-goes-virtual-\nfor-three-for-all-showdown-production/)[SVG SportsTech On Demand: AIDA Content\nManagement's Peter Flood Talks Video Meta Hub, Power of\nMetadata](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/svg-sportstech-on-demand-\naida-content-managements-peter-flood-talks-video-meta-hub-power-of-\nmetadata/)[SVG SportsTech On Demand: The Studio - B&H's Michel Suissa on\nMeeting the New Demands of the Sports Video\nIndustry](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/svg-sportstech-on-demand-the-\nstudio-bhs-michel-suissa-on-meeting-the-new-demands-of-the-sports-video-\nindustry/)[SVG SportsTech On Demand: TVU Network's Ken Valdiserri on\nSupporting the Industry with the Project Pool Feed\nInitiative](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/svg-sportstech-on-demand-\ntvu-networks-ken-valdiserri-on-supporting-the-industry-with-the-project-pool-\nfeed-initiative/)[SVG SportsTech On Demand: Sparx Technology's Kevin Annison\non the Changing Face of Sports\nInteractivity](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/svg-sportstech-on-\ndemand-sparx-technologys-kevin-annison-on-the-changing-face-of-sports-\ninteractivity/)[SVG SportsTech On Demand: Levels Beyond's Art Raymond Details\nLatest Developments for Reach\nEngine](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/07/svg-sportstech-on-demand-\nlevels-beyonds-art-raymond-details-latest-developments-for-reach-engine/)[EA\nGets Apex Legends Esports Back On-Air With Cloud-Based Remote-Production\nWorkflow](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/06/ea-gets-apex-legends-esports-\nback-on-air-with-cloud-based-remote-production-workflow/)[PGA TOUR, LPGA,\nOther Golf Associations Reschedule Major Events in\n2020](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/06/pga-tour-lpga-other-golf-\nassociations-reschedule-major-events-in-2020/)\n\n## Subscribe and Get SVG Newsletters\n\n![](https://www.sportsvideo.org/new/wp-content/themes/svg2015/img/linex2.png)\n\n  * **SVG Insider** _(Tuesday - Friday)_\n  * **SVG Digital Now** _(Monday)_\n  * **SportSound** _(Monthly)_\n  * **College** _(Monthly)_\n  * **Venue Production** _(Monthly)_\n\n  \n\n  * [Home](https://www.sportsvideo.org/)\n  * [News](https://www.sportsvideo.org/news/)\n  * [Events](/events/)\n  * [On Demand](https://www.sportsvideo.org/on-demand/)\n  * [Initiatives](https://www.sportsvideo.org/initiatives/)\n  * [Resources](https://www.sportsvideo.org/resources/)\n  * [Sponsorship](https://www.sportsvideo.org/sponsorship/)\n  * [SVG Europe](http://www.svgeurope.org/)\n  * [Blogs](https://www.sportsvideo.org/blogs/)\n  * [About](https://www.sportsvideo.org/about/)\n  * [Join](https://www.sportsvideo.org/about/join-svg-today/)\n  * [Free SVG Newsletters](http://www.sportsvideo.org/subscription-form/)\n  * [Members](http://member.sportsvideo.org/)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.sportsvideo.org/about/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Contact](https://www.sportsvideo.org/about/contact-us/)\n\n(C) 2020 Sports Video Group.

continue your class in the manner that you've planned may be\nimpacted. This guide helps you prepare alternatives for these situations in\norder to minimize loss of learning time and lessen the impact of a disruption.\n\nSupport for students can be found at\n[keeplearning.ucsd.edu](https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu/).\n\nIf you need help with remote work tasks, such as forwarding your phone and\nvoicemail, you can find it at\n[keepworking.ucsd.edu.](https://keepworking.ucsd.edu/)\n\nFor library resources, [https://library.ucsd.edu/ask-us/services-during-\ncovid-19.html](https://library.ucsd.edu/ask-us/services-during-covid-19.html).\n\nFor information about best practices for promoting and protecting integrity in\nthe remote teaching and learning environment, see the [Academic Integrity\nOffice COVID-19 webpage for faculty.](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-\naction/covid-19-faculty.html \"https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-\naction/covid-19-faculty.html\")\n\nFor privacy considerations during modified campus operations, see\n[https://evc.ucsd.edu/units/privacy/covid-19.html](https://evc.ucsd.edu/units/privacy/covid-19.html).\n\nFor a list of online learning resources for parents see,\n[http://humanmedicine.msu.edu/News/2020/online-learning-\nresources.htm](http://humanmedicine.msu.edu/News/2020/online-learning-\nresources.htm).\n\nTo help instructors prepare for teaching remotely during Spring 2020, the\nDigital Learning Hub (DLH) at the Teaching + Learning Commons, in partnership\nwith Educational Technology Services, will host live Zoom sessions to cover\noptions for remote instruction and other frequently asked questions. The\nupcoming live Zoom sessions can be accessed using\n[https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/edtechsupport](https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/edtechsupport)\n(no registration required)\n\n**Upcoming dates and times :**\n\n  * [Remote Assessments and Proctoring: Well-Designed Assessments and When Proctoring is Recommended: Wednesday, April 8 at 10:00am](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/383801550). The webinar will be recorded and made available on [keepteaching.ucsd.edu](https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu/). Please email [online@ucsd.edu](mailto:online@ucsd.edu) for additional assistance.   \n\n  * [See Workshop Calendar with live Zoom sessions offered by EdTech Support](https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html)\n\n[Find previously recorded training\nsessions.](https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-\nresources/recorded-trainings.html)\n\n## Communicate with Students Off-Campus\n\nDuring a potentially disruptive event, it is essential for instructors to\nestablish and maintain open communication lines with students. UC San Diego's\n[Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/) LMS offers convenient methods of\ncommunication with your class:\n\n  * [Posting an Announcement](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10405-415250731) is the fastest way to communicate with your entire class.\n  * [Inbox](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-12810-4152719677), the Canvas messaging tool, is used to communicate with a course, a group, an individual student, or a group of students.\n\nWe suggest you ask your students to update their [notifications\nsettings](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13111-4152719738) so that\nCanvas Announcements and Inbox Conversations are forwarded to their email\naddress.\n\nIn addition to enabling class-related communication, you and your students\nshould consider signing up for campus-wide emergency notifications at [The UC\nSan Diego Triton Alert emergency notification\nsystem](https://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/emergencies/campuswide/notifications/index.html?_ga=2.49262054.1940903272.1583164058-831261033.1572974520).\n\n## Deliver a Lecture Online\n\nInstructors can host online lectures or discussions with their students,\neither:\n\n### Synchronously  \n\nClasses are held **on set schedules and times** , so students and instructors\nare online and interacting at the same time.\n\n  \n\nUC San Diego School of Medicine (SOM) provides lecture capture services via\nPanopto.\n\nFor a virtual, synchronous lecture, [Zoom](https://uchealth.zoom.us/) web\nconferencing is a great solution. In a Zoom meeting, both instructors and\nstudents can share audio, video and screen presentations. There is also an\noption to record the Zoom session(s), which can be saved and posted to Canvas\nafter the session ends.\n\n  * [Teaching with Zoom Instructor Guide](/education/mededtech/Documents/Teaching_with_Zoom.pdf)\n  * [Using Zoom Meeting: The Basics](/education/mededtech/Documents/Zoom_Basics_Narrated.pptx) narrated by Charlie Goldberg, MD\n\n####  What to do before class?\n\n  1. Find a quiet location that is free of distraction. Be sure you have a working web cam, microphone, and headphones.\n  2. Test your audio and video before joining the session by clicking the **Settings** icon in the Zoom application and using both the **Video** and **Audio** tabs.\n    * Clicking the **Video** tab should automatically show what your camera is capturing. If you are able to see your face, no other action is needed. If you are unable to see your face, click in the area to the right of **Camera** and select another input. If you are still unable to see yourface, contact [MedEdTech](mailto:mededtech@ucsd.edu?Subject=Zoom - No Video).\n    * Clicking the **Audio** tab will allow you to test both your speaker and microphone. Click on both **Test Speake** r and **Test Mic** to ensure they work. If one or both do not work, click in the area to the right of them to select a different device. If you are unable to get either your speaker or microphone to work, contact [MedEdTech](mailto:mededtech@ucsd.edu?Subject=Zoom - No Audio).\n  3. Join [Zoom's test meeting](https://zoom.us/j/380605985) and try to chat or raise your hand.\n  4. Test sharing your screen and make sure you are comfortable doing so. Click **Share Screen** in Zoom and select if you want to share your entire screen or a specific application. Other participants are able to see the content on your screen and you have the option of clicking **Annotate** to make your mouse a laser pointer or drawing on the screen.\n\n####  What to do during class?\n\n  1. Click on **Participants** and **Chat** after you join the session. Students will either ask questions in the **Chat** or \u201craise their hand\u201d in the **Participants** screen by using the raise hand icon beside their name. _You can click the down arrow in either window and click_ **_Pop Out_** _to open it in a separate window._\n  2. Monitor the **Participants** and **Chat** windows for questions and ask the instructor during scheduled breaks or call out a few students to unmute their microphones and ask themselves. This will be a short period of time, so try to reiterate the question if multiple students are asking something similar.\n  3. Mute any students that are not already and are making noise during instruction. You can do this by hovering over their name in the **Participants** window and clicking **Mute**.\n  4. If the instructor wants students to breakout shortly to into small groups, you can do so by clicking **Breakout Rooms**. A new window will pop up and you can choose how many groups to set up and assign students either automatically (random) or manually. _We'd ask the instructor to do this before the session because it can take some time to assign students manually._\n    * Once all students have been assigned to their breakout rooms, click **Open All Rooms**. Students will get a prompt to join. When the instructor is ready for everyone to come back together, click **Close All Rooms**. Students will get a 60 second countdown on their screen before they return or they can click on screen to join back early.\n\n### Asynchronously  \n\nLectures and/or discussions are **pre-recorded**. Students watch the videos at\ntheir own pace.  \n\nFor a virtual, asynchronous meeting, instructors can choose to [record a\nlecture](https://ucsd-\nsom.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=d45e3aee-0256-4ce5-9a58-e09dcbe194b9)\nor [upload a pre-existing video or audio file](https://ucsd-\nsom.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=a0a65334-d878-42f0-843c-b234bd73cfa9)\nin Panopto.

The professor often hands those\nwhite Hagoromo sticks to students so they, too, can wrestle with theorems and\nproofs in front of the class. It is a tactile ritual, he believes, rooted in\nthe math traditions of the ancient Arabs and Greeks.\n\nNow Ono must make do with a digital pen, an iPad and a Zoom video link as he\nlaunches a remote session of Math 3354 for the University of Virginia.\n\n _For_ U-Va. Not _at_ U-Va.\n\n\u201cGreat, can everybody hear me?\u201d Ono asked as the 75-minute class began one\nafternoon last week. He was talking from a bedroom office in Charlottesville,\nwith about 35 students tuned in from across the state and beyond.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look in the chat box for a bunch of yeses,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome back to\nU-Va. on [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-\nyou-need-know-about-\ncoronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_7&itid=lk_inline_manual_7). . . . It\u2019s not\nperfect, but we do the best we can.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAcross America, colleges and universities are racing to rescue spring terms\nfrom the wreckage of the coronavirus pandemic. Faculty members are on the\nfront lines of this massive and unprecedented shift from in-person to online\nteaching. The tech-savvy are guiding the technophobes in the use of video\ntools such as Panopto, Webex and Zoom.\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

Faculty members know that glitches and\ncrashes will happen. Many students will struggle to get reliable Internet\naccess, decent computers or accommodations needed for disabilities. Still,\nlegions are relying on professors to provide at least a semblance of academic\nroutine. Without that, students are at risk of delay or derailment on the path\nto graduation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe faculty have to be flexible and patient,\u201d said Marcio A. Oliveira,\nassistant vice president for academic technology and innovation at the\nUniversity of Maryland. Kindness is essential, policies bendable. Instructors\nmust understand, Oliveira said, \u201cthat for students, the same deadlines and the\nsame ways of teaching may not work in this period right now.\u201d\n\nThe digital transformation of higher education has been building for years. In\n2012 and 2013, [universities discovered that massive audiences\n](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/elite-education-for-the-\nmasses/2012/11/03/c2ac8144-121b-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_17&itid=lk_inline_manual_17)could\nbe developed for online courses from star professors on a range of topics,\nfrom artificial intelligence to modern poetry. Even before the pandemic, many\neducators had \u201cflipped\u201d their classes, giving students lectures online that\nthey could review on their own time so that class hours were freed for\ndiscussion and projects. It is common, of course, for universities to offer\nentire courses and even degrees online. Those ventures typically require\nmonths of planning.\n\nAD\n\nWhat makes the coronavirus crisis unique is the sudden prohibition of in-\nperson classes, with scant time to adapt.\n\nAD\n\nEven St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis has made the shift. At the [500-student\nliberal arts school](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/attention-\ncollege-shoppers-these-schools-are-slashing-their-\nprices/2019/01/21/e384eca0-12bc-11e9-90a8-136fa44b80ba_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_21&itid=lk_inline_manual_21),\nfaculty members are called tutors, and classes are conversations about the\ngreat works of Western civilization. Some tutors are so tech-averse that they\ndon\u2019t use email. Yet the college in Maryland\u2019s capital, shuttered for face-to-\nface teaching, has resumed via video with only a few cuts to the reading list\nbecause of lost time. (Out are Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201c[Poetics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199608369?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0199608369\n\"www.amazon.com\")\u201d for freshmen and Rousseau\u2019s \u201c[The Social\nContract](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140442014?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0140442014\n\"www.amazon.com\")\u201d for juniors.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been just elated,\u201d said Panayiotis Kanelos, the college\u2019s president.\n\u201cIt\u2019s doable. There are things that are lost and things that are gained.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor many public universities, the scale of the mid-semester switch is\nstaggering. U-Va. has more than 16,000 undergraduates and U-Md. more than\n30,000. Both flagships also have thousands of graduate students whose\ncoursework and research have been disrupted under the orders to stay home.\n\nAD\n\nThe universities have taken steps to secure computer and WiFi access for\nstudents who lack those tools. Officials say they are working to help those\nwith disabilities and special needs. Both schools also are making\nundergraduate courses pass-fail unless students choose to receive a letter\ngrade.\n\nThere is no single formula for remote teaching at schools with thousands of\nseminars, laboratories, lectures, performances and courses in other formats.\nIn general, educators say, many lab classes will rely on data collected from\nexperiments underway or finished before the coronavirus shutdown. They\u2019ll move\nto data analysis. Likewise, professors and students in performing arts and\nother fields oriented to physical gatherings and activities must shift gears.\n\nAD\n\nAt College Park, classes resumed Monday after an extended spring break to give\nfaculty time to prepare.\n\nAD\n\nFor Tammatha O\u2019Brien, a senior lecturer in entomology, the transition is not\ndaunting. She has used video lectures for years to maximize the value of face\ntime with students. The lectures are, in essence, narrated slide decks. \u201cThey\ncan pace it, slow it down, go faster, go slower,\u201d she said. \u201cStudents actually\nreally do enjoy it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien **** is teaching ecology, endocrinology and anatomy/physiology. She\nplans to use online discussion boards and video lectures to finish the term.\nMost instruction will be \u201casynchronous\u201d \u2014 meaning students will not be\nrequired to meet online simultaneously. That is meant to help those who live\nin different time zones or have obligations or distractions at home.\n\nAD\n\nGrades will be based on quizzes and projects completed during the semester,\nbut O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t plan to give students final exams. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a\nlot of stress off them,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nBarnet Pav\u00e3o-Zuckerman, an associate professor of anthropology at U-Md., has a\nsteeper learning curve. She teaches ecological and evolutionary anthropology\nto 130 students. A self-described extrovert who loves to lecture, she knows\nhow to scan the room for facial cues to check whether students are lost or\nengaged. She had never recorded a lecture until one she gave a couple of weeks\nago on the extinction of dinosaurs.\n\nNow Pav\u00e3o-Zuckerman is churning out bite-size lectures from her basement in\nColesville, Md., for students to review at their convenience. As props, she\nuses skull replicas grabbed from a campus lab. Her 10-year-old daughter makes\ncameos.\n\n\u201cHi, everybody,\u201d the professor said in one 10-minute video. \u201cThis is my first\nlecture from home using Panopto. I\u2019m in my basement that shows the books\nbehind me instead of the kids\u2019 toys on the other side of the room. So \u2014 we\u2019re\ngoing to talk about the emergence of primates today. And this is very strange\nbecause I can\u2019t see your faces.\u201d\n\nPav\u00e3o-Zuckerman said she plans to use Zoom for office hours. Her student\nteaching assistants have scoured the Internet for interactive tools to\nsimulate labs. The class will have open-book quizzes and tests. She cautions\nthat there are limits to what can be done in a quick online retrofit. \u201cTo do\nthis for real, we would like six months to prepare,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt U-Va., remote classes began March 19. The university surveyed faculty\nbeforehand and found that about two-thirds felt comfortable teaching their\ncourses virtually. But many needed guidance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a technophobe,\u201d said Herbert \u201cTico\u201d Braun, a veteran professor of\nhistory. \u201cThis stuff scares the hell out of me. I get in front of one of these\nmachines, and I start to perspire. . . . I really didn\u2019t know how I was going\nto be able to do this.\u201d\n\nBraun\u2019s first attempt to hold a 75-minute Zoom seminar \u201cdid not go so well,\u201d\nhe said. He found himself talking too much and too fast. The second time, he\nslowed down. He gave students more chances to speak up in a discussion about\nCanadian philosopher Charles Taylor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s a matter of being more confident with the screen in front of\nyou,\u201d Braun said, \u201cbreathing more slowly and being able to do this. And it\nhappens. And it works.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the last 10 minutes, Braun opened up the class for students to talk about\nwhere they are and how they\u2019re doing. \u201cThis is traumatic for them,\u201d he said,\n\u201cin ways that are almost unimaginable for us.\u201d\n\nEvan Brandt, 21, a junior majoring in math and Spanish, said it is surreal to\ntake classes from his basement in Gainesville, Va. He misses swimming the\nbutterfly for U-Va.\u2019s club team and hanging out on spring afternoons on the\nfamed Lawn. \u201cIt\u2019s a big bummer,\u201d Brandt said.\n\nBut he said he is astounded at how fast professors have reshaped their\ncourses. \u201cI still feel like I\u2019m getting U-Va. kind of quality,\u201d he said. His\nclasses meet at the same time they did when Brandt was in Charlottesville.\n\u201cWhich I actually like because it keeps me on a schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of those classes was Ken Ono\u2019s survey of modern algebra. The professor\nsaid many in his field are skeptical of online teaching. \u201cYou would think\nmathematicians would be into computers, into technology and all that,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cHonestly that\u2019s not true.

The tools and skills that faculty are\nlearning now will help them meet the needs of a generation of students that\nare far more electronic.\"\n\nJeanne Myers, learning designer\n\nSchool of Management\n\nAs educators and students across the nation rapidly adjust to distance\nlearning, UB faculty members have developed innovative tools and turned to\nnon-conventional methods to continue teaching their students.\n\nFrom crafting homemade document cameras to arranging cross-country tutoring,\nfaculty are adapting quickly to the digital learning landscape caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The new term is academic preparedness,\" says Jeanne Myers, a learning\ndesigner in the School of Management who has played a critical role in helping\nfaculty transition to online courses.\n\n\"The tools and skills that faculty are learning now will help them meet the\nneeds of a generation of students that are far more electronic. This type of\nenvironment has forced us all to collaborate and take a hard look at our\npreparedness for education in the future,\" adds Myers, also a member of the UB\nEducational Design Collaborative and an Open SUNY fellow.\n\nSome of the faculty innovations implemented this semester include:\n\n **Transforming household junk into teaching tools**\n\n[ ![A document reader assembled using scrap parts and a web cam, pictured in a\nhome office. ](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-\narticles/stories/2020/04/creative-online-\nlearning/_jcr_content/par/image_1220243063.img.220.auto.jpg/1585937522832.jpg)\n](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-\narticles/stories/2020/04/creative-online-\nlearning/_jcr_content/par/image_1220243063.img.original.png/1585937522832.png)\n\nIgor Jankovic and Todd Snyder channeled their inner-MacGyver to build a\ndocument reader that faculty can use from home.  \n\nFor some faculty members teaching from their homes, the document camera is a\nmissed technology from the classroom. Many faculty use handwritten notes to\nguide students through problem-solving steps. Without the equipment, students\nlose a critical piece of their learning.\n\nSo when Igor Jankovic, associate professor of civil, structural and\nenvironmental engineering, found an old web camera in a box of junk at his\nhome, he decided to put the forgotten lens to use.\n\nWorking with Todd Snyder, instructional support specialist in the School of\nEngineering and Applied Sciences, the pair channeled their inner MacGyver to\nfashion a stand for the camera using scraps of 80/20 aluminum framing.\n\nAfter quickly constructing a prototype, they formed an improved working model\nfor less than $30 that functioned seamlessly with Panopto, a software for\nstreaming and recording lectures.\n\n\"The beauty of these webcams, in addition to having a high-quality lens and\nmicrophone, is that they are old enough so that the drivers come installed on\nWindows 10,\" says Snyder. \"We tested it on my desktop PC, and the camera\nworked immediately and appeared instantly as an input for Panopto.\"\n\nJankovic bought more cameras online and the pair manufactured five additional\ncamera stands to distribute among other faculty. Snyder is also creating a\nguide for faculty to build their own homemade document cameras out of a range\nof materials, including wood, joints and screws.\n\n[ ![Hand made document readers assembled for use for distance learning.\n](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-\narticles/stories/2020/04/creative-online-\nlearning/_jcr_content/par/image_443041350.img.680.auto.jpg/1585937680289.jpg)\n](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-\narticles/stories/2020/04/creative-online-\nlearning/_jcr_content/par/image_443041350.img.original.png/1585937680289.png)\n\nIgor Jankovic and Todd Snyder fashioned a stand for an old web camera from\nscraps of 80/20 aluminum framing.\n\n **Transferring tech for teens to the college campus**\n\n\"War and American Memory,\" an upper-level course in the Department of History,\ndoes not have a final exam.\n\nInstead, students are tasked with learning historical figures, passionately\ndebating that character's ideologies and swaying their classmates toward their\npolitical faction in a role-playing game.\n\nWhile the discussion-based project worked well in the classroom, Sarah\nHandley-Cousins, clinical assistant professor of history and course\ninstructor, had to quickly find a way to move the assignment online while\nmaintaining engagement.\n\nHandley-Cousins found her solution in Flipgrid, a video-sharing app primarily\naimed at young students. Similar to the photo-sharing app Instagram, Flipgrid\nallows students to share short videos and comment on their classmates' posts.\nClass communication also takes place on the messaging platform Slack.\n\n\"I hesitated to hold live discussions because I didn't know what each\nstudent's living situation was like. This method preserves the face-to-face\ncomponent and gameplay of the project,\" Handley-Cousins says.\n\nShe is also using the software for her course \"Historical Writing,\" where\nstudents are required to present oral presentations on class materials. To\naccommodate the limits of the app, presentations will be shortened from 10 to\nfive minutes.\n\n\"The last few weeks have shown me that flexibility is okay,\" she says. \"It has\nshaken my way of digging my claws into the way things have to be. Some things\nfrom the course can get cut. Some things can get changed. The students are\nstill going to learn.\"\n\n **No classroom, no problem**\n\nMany students enrolled in pre-K-12 schools across the nation lack the access\nto technology that enables consistent online communication with their\ninstructors.\n\nFor teacher candidates enrolled in the Graduate School of Education's Teacher\nEducation Programs, classroom experience is essential to their certification\nand preparation for the field. With most learning transitioned online, the\nGraduate School of Education encouraged candidates to become inventive in how\nthey connected with their students.\n\nChristina Turowski, a former lawyer pursuing a teaching certification in\nsocial studies, created a [website on U.S.\nhistory](https://historywithmrst.webnode.com/) for her seventh-grade class in\none weekend. The website includes lesson plans for parents to use to\nsupplement their children's education, virtual tours of museums and national\nlandmarks, games and a podcast.\n\nEvery weekday, Turowski adds content to the site, which is accessed by\nhundreds of people.\n\n\"I made this website because there are parents out there who may not have the\nresources to teach their children moving forward. This is the whole reason I\nwanted to be back in the classroom, to help students,\" she says.\n\nAnother group of candidates enrolled in the Early Childhood/Childhood teacher\ncertification program is privately tutoring students online across the nation,\nconnecting with families in New York, Massachusetts and Nevada.\n\n\"Everyone in the cohort wants to work with the kids. We came to the master's\nprogram to make an impact in childhood education,\" says Kaleigh Kenefick, who\nis tutoring a pair of young children in Massachusetts on telling time, writing\nand social interaction.\n\n\"There are so many kids not in school that could use our help. We felt an\ninternal drive to help them get a better education, no matter where they\nwere.\"\n\nProgram clinical supervisor Grace Maylin reached out on social media to\nmothers who needed tutoring for their children. After being matched, the\neducators performed meet and greets with the families to learn areas of need\nand formed lesson plans.\n\n\"We normally have little say in the classrooms on the curriculum. This is a\nunique opportunity to use everything we learned to keep these kids engaged in\nwhat we know and love,\" says Emma Janicki-Gechoff, who is tutoring science and\nplanning backyard learning activities for elementary school children in New\nYork.\n\n **Libraries race to go digital**\n\nWhen the university announced that it would transition to distance learning,\nthe University Libraries toiled around the clock to move course materials\nonline for dozens of faculty and digitize hundreds of books.\n\nWith only the week of spring break available, Libraries Education Services\nworked with more than 50 instructors in the Department of English and English\nLanguage Institute who were teaching \"Writing and Rhetoric\" - a course\ndelivered to 60% of the undergraduate population - to move remaining\ninformation literacy lectures, assignments and quizzes online.\n\nLibraries Education Services also partnered with the Center for Educational\nInnovation to provide faculty with virtual assistance on using online video or\ninstruction software, such as Blackboard, Webex, Panopto and Respondus.\n\nOther university librarians worked to place research guides, textbooks and\ncourse materials online before access to physical materials became limited.\nUniversity librarians remain available through virtual chat services.\n\n\"The libraries had the grand task of putting everything online in just a\nweek,\" says Cynthia Tysick, director of education services in the UB\nLibraries. \"One hundred sixty people became one driving force, working at all\ndifferent hours.\"\n\nPlease leave blank\n\n## Comments\n\nUBNow encourages discussion and welcomes comments from UB faculty, staff and\nstudents using a @buffalo.edu email address.\n\nComments are limited to 125 words and must follow the university's [Comment\nGuidelines.](http://www.buffalo.edu/home/CommentGuidelines.html)\n\nThe UBNow editor moderates comments and reserves the right not to publish\nthose that do not add anything new to the discussion or fail to adhere to the\nComment Guidelines.\n\nPlease submit your comments in the box below.\n\nName\n\n(Required)\n\nEmail\n\n(Required)\n\nComment\n\n(Required)\n\nLatest on coronavirus\n\n  * [ 4/7/20 4/7: Important COVID-19 advisory - Governors Complex ](/coronavirus/bulletins/announcement-host.host.html/content/shared/www/coronavirus/previous-bulletins/b-4-7-1.detail.html)\n  * [ 4/7/20 4/7: HR provides guidance to employees on use of face coverings on campus ](/coronavirus/bulletins/announcement-host.host.html/content/shared/www/coronavirus/previous-bulletins/b-4-7-2.detail.html)\n  * [ 4/6/20 4/6: Tripathi updates campus on commencement, summer session ](/coronavirus/bulletins/announcement-host.host.html/content/shared/www/coronavirus/previous-bulletins/b-4-6-2.detail.html)\n\n### [WORKING AT\nUB](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubreporter/working/announcements.html)\n\n  * [ 4/7/20 UB encourages staff to wear masks when appropriate ](//www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/face-masks.html)\n  * [ 4/6/20 Ostrov appointed to NIH study section ](//www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/ostrov-nih-study-section.html)\n  * [ 4/3/20 Mendola named chair of epidemiology and environmental health ](//www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/mendola-eeh-chair.html)\n\n### FEATURED EVENT\n\nLoading events\u2026\n\n### UB IN THE NEWS\n\n[How to protect yourself from coronavirus when grocery\nshopping](//www.buffalo.edu/news/ub-in-the-news/2020/04/004.html)\n\n4/3/20\n\n **Consumer Reports** quotes **Erin Hatton** in a story on the different ways\npeople can obtain groceries during the pandemic.\n\n[The comfort-food recipes we need right now.](//www.buffalo.edu/news/ub-in-\nthe-news/2020/04/003.html)\n\n4/3/20\n\n **The Wall Street Journal  **quotes **Shira Gabriel** in a story on comfort\nfood, and how cooking is uplifting at a time when so little seems normal.\n\n[Buffalo braces to become a coronavirus battleground, even as Cuomo seeks\nstatewide help for New York City](//www.buffalo.edu/news/ub-in-the-\nnews/2020/04/001.html)\n\n4/1/20\n\n **The Washington Post**  quotes **Thomas Russo** on Buffalo's efforts to\nfight the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\n[ More UB in the News> ](/news/ub-in-the-news.html)\n\n[![Get Blue Fridays.

Everything you need to know about how technology is reshaping business](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-digital-transformation-everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-technology-is-reshaping/)\n\nThe obvious solution was to use technology to help staff and students get\nonline and interact, but the institution was far from ready. A week before\nlockdown, just 100 Sussex staff had the ability to work from home via remote\ndesktop protocol.\n\nBut now 3,000 staff and 19,00 students can connect to the institution and work\nor study from home, a massive switch to remote working across the university\ndelivered in super-quick time.\n\n **SEE:**[ **Digital transformation: A CXO's\nguide**](http://www.zdnet.com/topic/digital-transformation-a-cxos-guide/)\n**(ZDNet special report) |**[ **Download the report as a\nPDF**](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/digital-\ntransformation-a-cxo-s-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b) **(TechRepublic)**\n\nThe answer, says Jason Oliver, director of IT at the University of Sussex, was\nto fast-forward a five-year digital transformation strategy \u2013 which includes\nthe introduction of cloud-based applications, networking and video-\nconferencing technology \u2013 that's been more than a year in the making.\n\n\"What's happened on the back of the coronavirus is that a lot of that five-\nyear plan for transformation has had to be condensed into a week,\" he says. \"A\ndecision was taken that we had to respond to coronavirus and that's led to me\ntrying to then move that five-year roadmap and strategy into a one-week\ndeliverable.\"\n\nThe creation of this strategy has been Oliver's key priority since joining the\ninstitution in September 2018. His aim is to help an organisation that has\ntraditionally under-invested in technology to embrace the opportunities for\ndistance-learning that digitisation affords.\n\nOliver's plan for digital-led change recently received sign-off from the\nsenior leadership team as a fully-costed transformation strategy. Once the\nimpact of coronavirus became apparent, the Sussex IT team turned that long-\nterm plan of action into a short-term business reality.\n\n\"Because we have support for the initiative, making that argument to bring\nthat digital transformation forward because of the benefit that it will bring\ngiven where we are now, particularly with people working remotely, was a much\neasier argument than it would have been if we'd had a standing start,\" he\nsays.\n\nThe IT team at Sussex has fast-tracked the implementation of a range of\ntechnologies, including Canvas' learning-management platform, Panopto's\nlecture-capture software, Citrix's virtual desktop infrastructure, Microsoft\nTeams for collaboration, Zoom video-conferencing technology, and AWS-supported\nbots.\n\nThe IT team had already spent the past few months thinking about how it was\ngoing to implement Canvas and Panopto as part of the digital transformation\nprocess. Oliver says that work has been expedited, so that the university's\nremote-working students now have a full, online-learning environment.\n\n **SEE:**[ **Working from home: Getting your team ready for the\nswitch**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/working-from-home-getting-your-team-\nready-for-the-switch/)\n\nLectures are streamed online and are available for viewing afterwards,\nincluding full captioning, meaning the resources are accessible to everybody,\nincluding students that don't have English as a first language.\n\nThose initial foundations for a learning environment have been bolstered by\npermission from the senior leadership team for the IT team to implement Zoom\nvideo-conferencing technology. The university will use this software to create\nreal-time seminars with staff and students.\n\n\"That's potentially transformative \u2013 the IT team has developed a single sign-\non system, with integrations into Panopto and Canvas, so that our students and\nour academics have a complete digital environment that mirrors in-classroom\nexperiences,\" says Oliver.\n\nThe IT team continues to hone its approach. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, it\nhad recently commissioned a proof-of-concept study into using a Citrix virtual\ndesktop environment to help stream educational apps. Once again, a decision\nwas made to expedite the implementation process.\n\nOliver says it usually takes at least six weeks to introduce Citrix into an\neducational environment. However, his team has completed that implementation\nwork in a week, meaning students can access the apps they need securely when\nthey're working from home.\n\nThis fast-paced transformation highlights how the spread of the coronavirus\nhas created demand for rapid change, led by CIOs.\n\n**SEE:**[ **Coronavirus: 'We got 10,000 staff remote working from home - in\none weekend'**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/coronavirus-how-we-\ngot-10000-staff-remote-working-from-home-in-just-one-weekend/)\n\nOliver said that the need to adapt to remote working has helped staff to\nembrace collaboration. University staff were given access to Microsoft Teams\nlast week and now almost all back-office functions are operating on the\nplatform.\n\n\"We're having our daily coding meetings using Teams,\" says Oliver. \"A number\nof the people involved in that meeting are people who wouldn't have been\nconfident using video-conferencing tools at all. But it's been a case of needs\nmust and people are really embracing these new ways of working.\"\n\nOliver says Sussex is also working with AWS to develop a machine-learning-\npowered bot that allows the IT team to field frequently-answered questions\nautomatically and to auto-route students to the online resources they need,\nsuch as software-installation files and user guides.\n\n\"It's all about making sure our academics and students have the right level of\nguidance and training to be able to use the tools effectively to ensure\ncontinuity of education as best we can,\" he says.\n\n**SEE:**[ **Coronavirus: Business and technology in a\npandemic**](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/coronavirus-business-and-technology-\nin-a-pandemic/)\n\nIn many ways, then, Oliver and his team are making the most of a very bad\nsituation. While they'd rather not have to deal with the world-changing impact\nof COVID-19, they're adapting quickly to this new way of working. The end\nresult could be that the future of education arrives far earlier than they\nmight have anticipated.\n\n\"We're always going to be constrained as a university by our geography \u2013 we're\na single-site campus and you can only fit so many people into that space,\" he\nsays. \"The logical step for us has always been to embrace digital technology\nto help us expand. Online distance learning is a facet of that \u2013 and\neverything that we're doing now because of coronavirus will feed into the\noverall growth ambitions within the institution.\"\n\n###  CXO\n\n  * [ZDNet's top enterprise CEOs of the 2010s](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zdnets-top-enterprise-ceos-of-the-2010s/)\n  * [Executive dies, taking investor cryptocurrency with him.

This happened on Monday 16 March and was to be\nimplemented by 9am the next day. The move to digital teaching happened so\nquickly, as it has for most universities, that we are still coming to terms\nwith what this means for the practicality of delivering lectures and keeping\nour personal commitments, like childcare.\n\nNeither of us is particularly digitally adept (as our students and colleagues\ncan attest). Two days ago, for the first time, we both used Panopto to record\nour lectures. It was a completely surreal experience talking to a blank screen\nwith a blank wall behind us. We are also keeping in contact with students and\ncolleagues via email, Skype and Microsoft Teams. Today, I (Theresa) delivered\nmy first live lecture through Blackboard Collaborate.\n\nThe students were due to go on a field trip to a local wood on Monday but that\nhas been cancelled. Instead, I gave a virtual field trip with pre-recorded\ndrone footage and photos. I thought I was doing so well, the students logged\non and I shared my PowerPoint screen, but in the last 10 minutes, as I was\nshowing the data and drone footage that they would need to write up for their\nreports, I didn\u2019t realise that they were still stuck on the PowerPoint slides\nand I was talking to myself!\n\nSo, what is the reality of two academics working together from home? It can be\neasier to get work done and the university has provided resources and\ncommunication to allow us to continue our work and support our students. We\nare saving time (and money) on the train commute. We find ourselves bouncing\nideas off each other. Yesterday morning we were able to Skype students that we\nco-supervise together.\n\nWhere one of us has had issues using the technology or it has not worked, we\nhave shared laptops and learned how to use the technology together. Our first\nsound checks were hilarious, as we gesticulated at the screen and mocked each\nother\u2019s accents (one slight Norfolk and the other an Australian-English\nhybrid) and filler words.\n\nHowever, being two academics working remotely can also be challenging. We\nalready miss the face-to-face interaction and relationships we have with our\nstudents and colleagues. The move to digital learning has helped to keep us in\ncontact, but it will never replace the connection that you get from direct\nhuman interaction.\n\n* * *\n\n[**Want to write for _THE_? Click for more information**](/write-times-higher-\neducation)\n\n* * *\n\nIt is also difficult to switch off, especially as there is always the pull to\ncheck email updates and to talk to each other about our work. There is also\nthe fact that we have two young children: a six-year-old and a two-year-old.\nWe find ourselves now having to juggle work and childcare, as my (Theresa\u2019s)\nmother, who is classed as a vulnerable person in this outbreak and who usually\nlooks after our youngest during the week while we work, will no longer be able\nto help. We have managed so far by putting a routine in place and taking turns\nat the computer to address our student and teaching commitments.\n\nWhat has materialised out of the Covid-19 outbreak and the suggested social\ndistancing measures is that we (as academics) have had, ironically, more\nquality time as a family. This certainly says something about how academia as\na professional vocation in \u201cnormal times\u201d is sometimes counterproductive to a\nhealthy and fulfilling family life.\n\nWe are managing so far in terms of delivering our teaching and looking after\nour family. In fact, in some ways we are enjoying it more.\n\nHowever, please check back with us again once the marking starts to build up\nand the primary schools in the UK close after 20 March. We are sure this is on\nthe mind of every academic with young school-aged children. In the meantime,\nthis might be a good chance for us to recommence potty training our two-year\nold \u2013 which didn\u2019t go so well a few months ago.\n\n**Theresa Mercer and Andrew Kythreotis are senior lecturers in the school of\ngeography at the[University of\nLincoln](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/university-lincoln).**\n\nRead more about\n\nRead more about:\n\n[Coronavirus](/policy/coronavirus)\n\nRead more\n\n### [Tips on working from home with children](/blog/tips-working-home-\nchildren)\n\n## Please [login](/the_user/login/nojs) or [register](/multistep-\nregister/ajax/welcome) to read this article.\n\n### Register to continue\n\n**Get a month's unlimited access to THE content online.** Just register and\ncomplete your career summary.\n\nRegistration is free and only takes a moment.

has said final-year students should be given a choice of how to\ncomplete their degrees. Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA\n\nThe National Union of\n[Students](https://www.theguardian.com/education/students) has called on\nuniversities to cancel or postpone this summer\u2019s exams to avoid further stress\nand disruption to students\u2019 lives during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe NUS said disabled, international and poorer students would be\nsignificantly disadvantaged if universities go through with plans to hold\nonline exams and assessments next term.\n\nIt said final-year students should be given a choice of how to complete their\ndegrees, such as receiving an estimated grade based on prior attainment, doing\nan open book online exam, or taking their finals at the university at a later\ndate.\n\n\u201cIn the current climate, student welfare must come first,\u201d said Claire\nSosienski-Smith, the NUS vice-president (higher education). \u201cIt is vital that\nthere are no compulsory exams this year.\u201d\n\nThe NUS added that all exams for first and second-year students should be\ncancelled, while postgraduate students should get a six-month extension to\ntheir submission deadlines.\n\nQuick guide\n\n#### UK lockdown: what are the coronavirus restrictions?\n\nShow Hide\n\n**What do the restrictions involve?**\n\nPeople in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following\npurposes:\n\n  * Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible\n  * One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household\n  * Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person\n  * Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home\n\nPolice will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and\ndispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at\nhome, the government will:\n\n  * Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship\n  * Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public \u2013 excluding people you live with\n  * Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals\n\nParks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nThe demand comes after [thousands of students across the\ncountry](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/21/oxbridge-to-\nreplace-summer-exams-with-online-assessments-due-to-coronavirus) called for\nalternative assessments to be put in place to ensure their academic\nperformance is not adversely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nMany international students at [Imperial College\nLondon](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-forces-\nmedical-students-sit-final-exams-online) face having to do their online exams\nin the middle of the night after the university notified them that \u201cbeing in a\ndifferent time zone cannot be used as a mitigating circumstance\u201d and they must\nbe \u201cavailable at the correct UK time, wherever they are\u201d. Some, including\nChinese students, cannot access study materials due to internet censorship.\n\nA physics student, who is quarantined in Shanghai, said he was unable to\naccess [Panopto](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-\nservice/teaching-learning/panopto/) lecture recordings for his revision\nbecause the site was blocked by China\u2019s firewall. \u201cImperial College has made\nit more difficult than regular exams because now you have to deal with\ntechnology and censorship,\u201d he said.\n\nMax, not his real name, said Chinese students were also under great stress\nbecause relatives had died of Covid-19. \u201cMy grandmother passed away because of\ncoronavirus,\u201d he said.\n\nThe physics student said he might also face being quarantined for another\nfortnight when he returns to his family home in Wuhan, the centre of the\nChinese outbreak, which would end around the time when his exams are due to\nstart.\n\nIn a statement, Imperial College said: \u201cWe are putting additional support in\nplace for students and we are updating our mitigating circumstances policy to\ntake account of where a student does not have access to the equipment or\nfacilities to undertake the assessment.\u201d\n\nPiers Wilkinson, the NUS\u2019s disabled students officer, said the academic year\nshould end now because universities cannot provide disabled students \u2013 who\nmake up 13% of the student population \u2013 with the reasonable adjustments they\nare legally required to put in place due to the pandemic lockdown.\n\nWilkinson said most of the study support provided to disabled students could\neither only be delivered on campus or would be impossible to provide remotely.\nThis included providing note-taking, sign-language interpreters, close\ncaptioning of lectures, and screen-readers that render text and image content\nas speech or Braille.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no way that disabled students can be on an equal level\nplaying field as every other student during this pandemic. They should be\nallowed to suspend their studies until it\u2019s reasonable and equitable for them\nto start again.\u201d\n\nA Cambridge student with diabetes and depression, who has suffered panic\nattacks during exams, said the university had not explained how it would\naccommodate her disability in an [online\nassessment](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/21/oxbridge-to-\nreplace-summer-exams-with-online-assessments-due-to-coronavirus). \u201cI\u2019m at high\nrisk of getting really ill if I contract coronavirus as [I have] diabetes,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cStress also adversely affects my blood glucose levels which makes\nit hard to get much done above staying healthy.\u201d\n\nCambridge University was approached for comment.\n\nA spokeswoman for\n[Universities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/universities) UK, which\nrepresents 137 higher education institutions, said universities were looking\nat various options to ensure students were fairly assessed. She added that\n\u201cuniversities will try to be as accommodating as they can\u201d to students\u2019\nvarying needs for support.\n\nTopics\n\n  * [ Universities

asking instructors to prepare for the possibility of shifting classes\nonline amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn an email sent to all teaching faculty on Monday afternoon, Vice Provost for\nEducation Beth Winkelstein encouraged instructors to familiarize themselves\nwith online-teaching tools in case Penn decides to cancel in-person classes.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nWinkelstein wrote that as of now, classes are expected to meet as scheduled\nwhen Penn returns from spring break on Monday, March 16.\n\nBut Penn is set to send out an update tomorrow on its response to coronavirus\nregarding travel and large events, according to an email sent to School of\nArts and Sciences spring 2020 instructors from College Dean Steven Fluharty,\nCollege Dean Paul Sniegowski, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies Beth Wenger,\nand Vice Dean for Liberal and Professional Studies Nora Lewis.\n\n**RELATED:**\n\n[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania is treating its first

disaster\ndeclaration](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-\npennsylvania-penn-tom-wolf)\n\nIf Penn shifts to online courses, the deans urge teachers to \"keep it simple\"\nand to \"use the Penn-recommended tools that [they] are most comfortable with\nto accomplish [their] course needs in the most straightforward way.\"\n\nThe repercussions for lab courses, studio courses, and courses involving\nclinical requirements are unclear. Winkelstein wrote that instructors for\nthese classes should develop a plan with their department chairs.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nThe email to all faculty featured links [explaining how to use multiple remote\nteaching tools](https://www.ctl.upenn.edu/resources-and-strategies-teaching-\nremotely) like [Canvas](https://infocanvas.upenn.edu/guides/request-canvas-\nsite/), [Panopto](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/computing/panopto-for-one-course),\n[Zoom](https://www.ctl.upenn.edu/zoom), and\n[BlueJeans](https://www.ctl.upenn.edu/bluejeans). Panopto is used for\nrecording lectures, while Zoom and BlueJeans work best for discussion-based\nseminars, Winkelstein wrote.\n\nWinkelstein encouraged faculty to test their computers' video cameras and\nmicrophones, as well as to update their operating systems.\n\nThe instructions to prepare for online classes mirror the responses of other\nuniversities in the northeast. Princeton University [called off in-person\nclasses ](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/03/09/president-eisgruber-\nupdates-university-next-steps-regarding-covid-19-ensure-health)for at least\ntwo weeks after their spring break.

Audrey Watters, writer and founder of HackEducation.com notes that,\n\"online learning isn't great for the most vulnerable.\"\n\nBefore schools make the move to online, Watters wants them to ensure that\ntheir students have access to the tools they will need to get work done.\nThat's printers, WiFi or data plan, a personal computer.\n\nWatters says the focus for schools should not be in technology as a solution\nfor long term issues, \"I think we need to build more human capacity,\" she\nsays, \"helping all sorts of people understand how we can better support one\nanother in teaching and learning.

Fellendorf, IT customer service manager, leads a training session\non web conferencing applications for Jacobs School faculty.\n\nJacobsen says that while the transition to distance learning was a major\nupheaval for the entire school, both faculty and students alike took it in\nstride.\n\nShe said most of the work focused on teaching faculty about different ways of\ncommunicating, including learning about web conferencing and downloading\ndifferent applications such as Zoom, WebEx and Panopto.\n\nJacobsen says the use of in-person training sessions and online tutorials got\nfaculty up to speed quickly, with much of the content created by [UB's Center\nfor Education Innovation](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubcei.html). She says the\nJacobs School's [Office of Medical\nCurriculum](/offices/ome/about/contact/curriculum.html) and Medical Education\nand Educational Research Institute were also involved in educating faculty\nabout the new teaching methods.\n\n\"And just because you bring everyone together in web conferencing, you also\nneed to think about what instructional techniques you can use to keep students\nengaged and involved to make sure it is more than just a one-way lecture,\" she\nsays. \"You need to develop methods to get students to interact, so that has\nbeen another learning process for the faculty.\"\n\n## Revamping Courses a Lesson in Ingenuity\n\n![](/content/shared/smbs/news/2020/04/distance-learning-\ntransition-11125/_jcr_content/par/image_1843996107.img.140.auto.jpg/1585772009453.jpg)![](//www.buffalo.edu/etc/designs/default/0.gif)\n\nChelsie E. Armbruster, PhD\n\n[Chelsie E. Armbruster,\nPhD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=chelsiea),\nassistant professor of [microbiology and immunology](/departments/micro.html),\nsays she is primarily involved in courses for master's and doctoral students,\nnone of which have traditionally used video lectures.\n\n\"I actually just took over as course director for MIC516 (Fundamentals of\nBacteriology) this semester, so the switch to distance learning meant having\nto revamp the course twice in a short period of time,\" she says.\n\n\"This course is typically a blend of didactic lectures with group discussions\nof primary scientific literature, along with student group final\npresentations, so we needed to rapidly shift to recording all lectures via\nPanopto and find an alternate method for conducting group discussions with a\nclass of 16 students,\" Armbruster says.\n\nArmbruster says one of the biggest challenges in transitioning the course to\ndistance learning was making sure that she and the other course instructors\nwere all comfortable with the features of Panopto, how to post recorded\nlectures to [UB Learns](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/service-guides/teaching-\ntechnology/ublearns.html), and which platform to use for group discussions.\n\n\"So far, the students seem comfortable with the transition,\" she says. \"Mostly\nthey have just expressed thanks at how quickly we communicated the changes so\nthat they would be prepared.\"\n\n## Students Benefit From Greater Flexibility\n\nArmbruster thinks one of the greatest benefits of the distance learning model\nis that it will make the didactic portion of the class more accessible to the\nstudents, because they now have the option of working through the course\nmaterial at their own pace, pausing the recorded lectures to take notes or\nreviewing a section if something wasn't clear.\n\n\"For my course, we are using discussion boards for group participation, which\nmay also allow students who are usually more reserved in class to share their\nthoughts and opinions and ask questions,\" she notes.\n\nJacobsen says she envisions students also using some of the new online tools\nto engage in small group discussions and problem-solving learning on their own\ntime.\n\n\"Maybe small groups can get together on their own time to work on a problem.\nMaybe they say 'let's meet at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday.' That might be something\nthey can do in a web conference, just having small groups they set up on their\nown time,\" she says. \"As students get more used to it, they may use these\nvirtual meetings to work together at off times or when it is convenient for\nthem.\"\n\nJacobsen says web conferencing is better than a conference call because\nparticipants can actually see each other -- some of the body language is still\nthere -- and notes that it brings a lot of the humanism back into the\nexperience.\n\n\"On a conference call, you have no idea who is in the room, you have no idea\nif they are looking at you with confusion. You don't even know if they hated\nyour idea or if they are all nodding their heads, loving your idea. You get\nnone of those visual cues,\" she says.\n\n## Human Interaction Still Essential Component\n\nHuman interaction needs to remain a critical component of the medical school\nexperience, says Jacobsen, a clinical associate professor of obstetrics and\ngynecology.\n\n\"Despite continuing technological advances, we don't believe we should always\nbe online for everything,\" she says. \"People need verbal communication,\ninteraction and socialization. People need to get to know each other in\nperson. You don't want to get rid of all these personal experiences.\"\n\n\"In our new curriculum and in the future, we do need to keep these experiences\nwhere students are actually in contact with each other, looking at each other\nacross the table, talking to each other, getting those body cues and all those\ncommunication cues that come through,\" Jacobsen says.\n\n\"When you look at and interact with someone, those things are all valuable,\nand they help you become a better clinician because you need to be able to\ninteract with your patients that way,\" she notes.\n\nJacobsen says medical students also need to learn to be able to communicate\neffectively with nurses, pharmacists and other allied health professionals in\na hospital or outpatient setting.\n\n\"Those skills are really important, so we definitely need to have experiences\nwhere people come together and solve problems together as a team,\" she says.\n\n## Exploring Most Effective Teaching Strategies\n\n![](/content/shared/smbs/news/2020/04/distance-learning-\ntransition-11125/_jcr_content/par/image.img.140.auto.jpg/1585778117537.jpg)![](//www.buffalo.edu/etc/designs/default/0.gif)\n\nStuart D. Inglis, PhD\n\n[Stuart D. Inglis,\nPhD](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=stuartin),\ninstructor of [pathology and anatomical\nsciences](/departments/pathology.html), is ahead of the curve in that he had\ntransitioned to a flipped classroom approach to teaching a few years ago.\n\nHis in-class video sessions are active learning, where students are challenged\nwith clinical questions that they work in groups to solve.\n\n\"From that perspective, the distance learning is not a major obstacle. It is a\nlittle more clunky than in the classroom but seems to work well,\" he says.\n\"The use of 'breakout rooms' in Zoom and other platforms closely simulates\nwhat we do in class, and once the learning curve for this software has been\ncleared, it should be fairly similar to the in-class experience.\"\n\nBecause he teaches an anatomy course with dissection, there are some\nsacrifices in moving to distance learning, Inglis notes.\n\n\"The biggest disappointment for both myself and the students are the\ndissection labs. These are the sort of intangible educational experiences that\nmake a university education so special, and which are so difficult to simulate\nonline,\" he says.\n\n\"I am grateful that the students had a good part of the term to engage in\ndissection, but it will be very difficult for them moving forward, seeing\nvideo sessions of others engaging in dissection, knowing what they are missing\nout on,\" Inglis adds.\n\nHowever, Inglis says the changes also present opportunities.\n\n\"The pandemic is challenging university professors to rethink the methods by\nwhich we deliver educational material and the efficacy of these methods,\" he\nsays. \"The traditional university lecture predates the printing press, at a\ntime when the most practical way to disseminate information was to dictate\nfrom a master text, while students frantically transcribed this information\nfor their own record.\"\n\n\"We have advanced far beyond the necessity to take notes from an oration to\narchive information,\" Inglis says. \"This is an opportunity to explore the most\neffective teaching strategies to educate both within and outside the walls of\ntraditional academia.\"\n\n##### Upcoming

(GeekWire Photo / Lisa Stiffler)\n\n_**Updated at 12:45 p.m. with details of Seattle Public Schools closure.**_\n\nAs Americans struggle to control the spread of the coronavirus, Washington\nstate, home to the first known U.S. infection and death due to COVID-19, has\nbeen in the forefront of taking the unprecedented step of closing schools and\nuniversities and moving to online instruction.\n\nFor the colleges and universities, which were already teaching some courses\neither partially or entirely online, basic technology infrastructure was in\nplace when instructors were told to go digital.\n\nBut shifting K-12 education into the online realm is particularly difficult\ngiven kids\u2019 unequal access to tech devices and internet connections, as well\nas the challenge of reimagining instruction and assignments in a remote\nsetting, particularly for the youngest students.\n\n[Seattle Public Schools\nannounced](https://www.seattleschools.org/district/calendars/news/what_s_new/coronavirus_update)\ntoday that it would close schools for at least two weeks. The district has\nsaid it would not offer online learning, explaining that moving to digital\ninstruction would exclude students lacking tech tools. The [Northshore School\nDistrict](https://www.nsd.org/covid19), located north of Seattle, was the\nfirst local district to shift all of its instruction online.\n\n#### Coronavirus Live Updates: [The latest COVID-19 developments in Seattle\nand the world of tech](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-live-updates-\nseattle-tech-community-grappling-covid-19/)\n\nGlobally, 16 countries have closed their schools nationwide, while an\nadditional 16 **\u2014** including the U.S. **\u2014** have enforced localized closures,\n[according to UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-\nemergencies/coronavirus-school-closures). The United Nations organization\nrecommends that educators implement digital learning to help prevent kids from\nfalling behind academically, and the group has a [list of education\nresources](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-\nschool-closures/solutions).\n\nThe [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/) was\nthe [first](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/university-of-washington-\nbecomes-first-u-s-college-to-cancel-classes-due-to-coronavirus/) large, public\nuniversity in the U.S. to announce last week that it was moving to online-only\ninstruction through at least the end of winter quarter, which concludes March\n20. [Washington State University\u2019s](https://wsu.edu/covid-19/2020/03/11/wsu-\nto-move-in-person-classes-to-online-formats-following-spring-break/) five\ncampuses will shift to distance learning beginning on March 23, after spring\nbreak ends.\n\nMultiple public community and technical colleges are following suit. The\nhigher-ed institutions had some experience with digital platforms as they\u2019ve\nbeen working for years to expand their reach and make instruction more\nconvenient through recorded or live online lectures and remote learning.\n\n![](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Eric-Burns-\nHeadshot-2015-150x150.png)Panopto CEO Eric Burns. (Panopto Photo)\n\n\u201cThese are trends that have been in place for a long time,\u201d said Eric Burns,\nCEO of Seattle-based Panopto, a company supporting digital lectures and\nmeetings. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this space for over 13 years. It\u2019s been a long slow\nbuild up. This is a trigger that causes organizations to hit the gas.\u201d\n\nThe UW, which serves 46,000 students across three Puget Sound-area campuses,\nprovides instructors with three main tools for online instruction:\n\n  * Every course is assigned a site with **[Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/)** , an education platform, and all of the students are enrolled automatically. The tool can be used for mass communications, asking questions, collecting assignments and posting group projects.\n  * A week ago, the UW purchased [**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/) Pro accounts for all lecturers to use for live instruction (previously instructors could use free Zoom accounts, which had limitations).\n  * Instructors use [**Panopto** ](https://www.panopto.com)to capture and share lectures online, including adding live polls and quizzes to the presentations.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, about 40% of UW courses had at least some\nelement of online learning, said [Beth\nKalikoff](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/about-the-ctl/ctl-staff/),\ndirector of the UW\u2019s Center for Teaching and Learning. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting\nentirely from scratch, and I\u2019m so glad,\u201d she said.\n\n![](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/B.Kalikoff-\nthumnail1-150x250-1.jpg)Beth Kalikoff. (UW Photo)\n\nIt\u2019s still a massive, disruptive shift to move online in a matter of days. It\ntakes finesse to create the same impact with a lecture delivered in person\nversus online, and some subjects don\u2019t smoothly translate to the format (think\nchemistry labs or fine arts subjects like dance and painting). There\u2019s the\nmatter of creating and proctoring quizzes and tests in a way that prevents\ncheating, educators said.\n\nAnd technology access issues are a serious challenge in higher education as\nwell, potentially putting lower income students and others who perhaps need\nmore support at an academic disadvantage. To help bridge the tech gap, the UW\nhas laptops available for students to check out, and its libraries **\u2014** which\nremain open **\u2014** have computer stations. The university also has Wi-Fi open\nto students on campus.\n\nBut for schools serving younger students, going digital is even less\nstraightforward.\n\nIn its announcement today, Seattle Public Schools wrote, \u201cThe decision to\nclose the district was extremely difficult. We know that closing our schools\nwill impact our most vulnerable families and we recognize that working\nfamilies depend on the consistency and predictability of supports and services\nour schools offer. We are working with partners and the city to determine how\nto best mitigate the impact closing schools will have on working families.\u201d\n\nNumerous private elementary, middle and high schools in the Seattle area are\nturning to digital instruction, some planning to operate remotely into April\nand past the end of spring break. The state has a [running list of\nclosures](https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/press-releases/novel-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-guidance-resources).\n\nPre-coronavirus outbreak, \u201cthere is a big chunk of online learning in the\nstate, but it\u2019s still the exception to the rule,\u201d said Rhett Nelson, director\nof the [Alternative Learning Department](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-\nsuccess/learning-alternatives) at the state\u2019s [Office of Superintendent of\nPublic Instruction](https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/press-releases/novel-\ncoronavirus-covid-19-guidance-resources).\n\nMost schools follow a traditional, in-person approach to teaching, he said,\nwith digital learning more common in rural districts. The online learning\navailable tends to be courses produced by a third party, as opposed to\ninstructors creating their own digital lessons.\n\nAs districts weigh the option of moving online, the state urges caution.\nLeaders are particularly concerned about whether schools can meet the needs of\nall students in a virtual classroom. Educators should consider whether all\nstudents have access to computers or tablets, sufficient internet access and a\nsafe, stable home environment plus parental support for learning.\n\n Our big push is the equity lens. It might be better to close your school and\nmake up those days later.\n\n\u201cOur big push is the equity lens,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt might be better to close\nyour school and make up those days later,\u201d than offering instruction that\nexcludes some students, he said.\n\nPublic Health \u2013 Seattle & King County had earlier recommended that [in most\ncases schools should not\nclose](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/news/2020/March/5-slowing-the-\nimpact.aspx). The health agency notes that children are \u201cnot known to get\nseriously ill from COVID-19;\u201d that closing schools could just shift the\ncongregation of kids to other locations; and that families may need to turn to\nolder childcare providers such as grandparents, who face more significant risk\nfrom the disease.\n\nClosing schools can also eliminate free meal programs that many families rely\non. Seattle schools announced that it has an emergency food plan that will be\nputting in place beginning March 16.\n\n> (1/3) Starting Thursday, March 12,\n> [@SeaPubSchools](https://twitter.com/SeaPubSchools?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and\n> the Seattle School Board will close Seattle Public Schools for a minimum of\n> 14 days as the CDC currently guides.

While the company\u2019s focus is on individual instruction, last\nSeptember it began piloting a [free, test-prep\ncourse](https://www.varsitytutors.com/free-sat-act-prep-course) for college\nexams that serves bigger audiences.\n\n\u201cWith the experience we had with the \u201cTest Prep 4 All,\u201d we feel uniquely\nsuited to help if schools are closed for an extended period,\u201d said [Brian\nGalvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-galvin-96778a2/), chief academic\nofficer for Varsity Tutors. \u201cWe feel an obligation.\u201d\n\nThe company is considering hosting live, online instruction for high school-\nage students, but is moving slowly to make sure the content is useful to\ndistricts in different states, as well as taking basic classroom management\nissues into consideration.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s a 30-person class, with the principal\u2019s office right down the hall,\nit\u2019s easy to know what to do with the class clown,\u201d Galvin said. Disruption in\nthe digital realm requires a different strategy.\n\nFor educators taking their instruction live and online, Galvin had tips for\nsuccessfully engaging with students:\n\n  * Ask short-answer questions, which encourages easy engagement and creates a culture of participation; longer, open-ended answers create a hurdle to students raising a digital hand and can slow down a class\n  * Use polls and emojis; these are tools that students are comfortable using in communication\n  * Track and incentivize participation, perhaps by letting kids pick nicknames and publicly awarding virtual stars to students who engage\n\nOnline teaching takes practice and a rethinking of approaches but holds\ndemonstrable promise, proponents said.\n\n\u201cYou can recreate just about anything you do in-person online,\u201d said the UW\u2019s\nKalikoff.

\"Share on Facebook\")\n\nAt the University of Oregon preparations are now underway to facilitate more\nthan 1,000 instructors\u2019 remote work.\n\nThe flurry of activity follow's President Michael H. Schill's March 19\n[announcement](https://president.uoregon.edu/covid-19-update-remote-\ninstruction-all-spring-term) that all course instruction will be delivered\nremotely for all of spring term, which begins Monday, March 30. Gov. Kate\nBrown ordered all state universities to continue online learning through April\n28, but many are opting to offer remote classes all term.\n\nThe move to remote instruction is part of UO\u2019s active measures to protect\nstudents, faculty, staff and the broader community from potential spread of\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus). The university has a large team __ working around-the-\nclock to respond to the situation, and status updates are regularly posted to\n__<https://uoregon.edu/coronavirus>.\n\n### Campus Resources: Remote Instruction\n\n[Academic Continuity guidelines from the Office of the\nProvost](https://provost.uoregon.edu/academic-continuity-resources-and-\nguidance)\n\n[March 24 continuity guidelines from executive vice provost for academic\naffairs](https://provost.uoregon.edu/information-academic-continuity)\n\n[Going Remote: Resources and guidance from Information\nServices](https://is.uoregon.edu/remote)\n\n[UO Libraries services and resources for remote\nteaching](https://library.uoregon.edu/remote-teaching)\n\n[Teaching Engagement Program: moving instruction\nonline](https://tep.uoregon.edu/moving-instruction-online-teaching-ideas)\n\n[Remote teaching ideas and updates from the UO Resource Sharing\nblog](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/keepteaching/)\n\nCanvas and Technology Support by phone or live chat, Mon-Sun | 6\na.m.-midnight, [541-346-4357](tel:+15413464357),\n[livehelp.uoregon.edu](https://livehelp.uoregon.edu/)\n\nIn a March 16 email to the faculty, Provost Patrick Phillips outlined key\npoints and strategies as the UO prepares for remote instruction.\n\nThe university will support remote delivery of lectures, office hours and\nother course content through digital applications including the\n[Canvas](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/) learning management system, [Zoom\nvideoconferencing](https://provost.uoregon.edu/introducing-zoom-uo-faculty-\nand-instructors) and [Panopto lecture\nrecording](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/keepteaching/2020/03/13/panopto-for-\nasynchronous-content-delivery/). The UO also upgraded its virtual private\nnetwork, the service that allows faculty members, staff and students to\nsecurely connect to the UO network from home or any other off-site internet to\naccess [certain\nresources](https://service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=31471).\n\nInstructors were encouraged to creatively explore how best to deliver their\ncourses in a high-quality fashion. Phillips also asked the UO faculty to take\nevery step possible to help students maintain solid connections to the\nuniversity as the institution moves to remote instruction.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that we do not allow this social distancing to become\nisolation,\u201d he wrote in his message to the faculty. \u201cIt is incumbent on us to\nfind new ways to maintain connection. Even as we are called to keep to\nourselves, we must move through this together.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the provost announced that formal teaching evaluations would be\nsuspended for the coming term. He also suggested that department and unit\nheads suspend all nonessential service and administrative activities, in order\nfor faculty members to concentrate on core educational programs.\n\nThe Office of the Provost is maintaining an [academic continuity\nwebsite](https://provost.uoregon.edu/academic-continuity-resources-and-\nguidance) to help guide instructors through the process of transitioning or\ncreating courses in this new format.\n\nJanet Woodruff-Borden, executive vice provost for academic affairs offered\nfurther information on academic continuity in a [March 24 message to the\nfaculty and GEs](https://provost.uoregon.edu/information-academic-continuity).\n\n\"We know for many of you that it will take some time to get used to delivering\ncourses remotely, and that you are being asked to pivot on short notice,\" she\nwrote. \"Please remember that you retain control of your course content and\npacing, so you can adjust week one activities and expectations to help you and\nyour students ease into the new environment.\"\n\nUO Online offers Canvas [technical assistance](https://online.uoregon.edu/get-\nstarted) and Canvas [support\ndocumentation](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/26382/pages/uo-online-and-\ncanvas-support-documentation) and guidance.

Please be in\ntouch with your questions, needs and sharable ideas.\"\n\nRayne Vieger, e-learning and open educational resource librarian and head of\nthe library\u2019s Remote Teaching Rapid Response Team, confirmed UO Libraries also\nwill continue to develop and maintain [library services and resources to\nsupport remote teaching](https://library.uoregon.edu/remote-teaching).\n\n\u201cAs part of the larger university academic continuity planning, librarians are\ncommitted to helping faculty members prepare to teach remote classes,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cWe are here to support student success by connecting faculty to their\n[subject librarians](https://library.uoregon.edu/subject-librarians), who can\nlocate existing library materials, purchase electronic resources or find open\neducational resources for classes. They can also integrate research guides in\nCanvas and provide remote library instruction.\u201d\n\nPhillips said he is confident that the faculty\u2019s commitment to quality\ninstruction and focus on core educational programs will play a key role for\nthe UO\u2019s resilience during a national health emergency.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly at the start of a very dynamic situation,\u201d he said. \u201cAs\nmentors and teachers, it is incumbent on us to find new ways to maintain\nconnection with our students in this challenging time, so as to build the\nresilient community that we seek.\u201d\n\n\u2014 _By_ _Jason Stone, University Communications_\n\n**[_Campus News_](/news/Campus-News)**\n\n[COVID-19 Updates and Information](https://www.uoregon.edu/coronavirus)\n\n## [Campus News](/news/Campus News)\n\n[The UO's Tim Duy talks coronavirus and the economy](/content/uos-tim-duy-\ntalks-coronavirus-and-economy)\n\n[UO police launch new campus bicycle retrieval program](/content/uo-police-\nlaunch-new-campus-bicycle-retrieval-program)\n\n[UO shop to begin fabricating much-needed face shields](/content/uo-shop-\nbegin-fabricating-much-needed-face-shields)\n\n[Oscar award winner chosen as next honorary degree recipient](/content/oscar-\naward-winner-chosen-next-honorary-degree-recipient)\n\n[$1 million goes to Students in Crisis Fund to help Ducks in\nneed](/content/1-million-goes-students-crisis-fund-help-ducks-need)\n\n[All Campus News](/news/Campus News)\n\nThere are currently no events happening.\n\n## About Around the O\n\nAround the O is the UO\u2019s go-to place for information about the university, its\npeople and the difference they make in Oregon and around the world.

SPECIAL TO THE ORACLE\n\nAs students prepare to close out the final six weeks of the spring semester,\nsome heavy adjustments will need to be made.\n\nToday, all classes shift from face-to-face to remote instruction due to the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\nStudents can access the online \u201c[Toolkit,](https://www.usf.edu/academic-\ncontinuity/index.aspx)\u201d which contains information and resources on how to\nnavigate the new reality of remote instruction. It includes student support\nfunctions, such as tutoring, counseling and advising to academic resources.\n\nStudents will have access to academic resources including Microsoft Teams,\nCanvas, Panopto Cloud and Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.\n\nOperated through Canvas, Panopto Cloud is a recording software that enables\nfaculty to record and upload lectures into Canvas. If a faculty member chooses\nto conduct a live lecture or hold office hours, they can use either Blackboard\nCollaborate Ultra or Microsoft Teams.\n\nWhen it comes to exams, faculty can opt to use Proctorio as a way to maintain\nacademic integrity while securing online exams. When using Proctorio, the\nsoftware will enable the lockdown of the test browser, can confirm the\nstudent\u2019s identity and record of the test taker\u2019s screen.\n\nTurnitin will also be available to detect plagiarism in assignments. The\nsoftware will scan papers and detect any plagiarism, which will then send an\noriginality report to the instructor with information regarding the\nsubmission.\n\nFor video-conferencing, professors may use Zoom for more interactive courses.\nStudents can create an account for free and join any meeting with a code\nprovided by the instructor.\n\nOther universities across the state have also been using Zoom for video-\nconferencing, including FSU and UF.\n\nBesides academic success, Toolkit will also be providing additional resources\nfor students to access remotely.\n\nAcademic advising will continue to operate throughout the semester by phone,\nSkype or online appointments. In addition, the counseling center and Career\nServices will be providing services remotely.\n\nSince the USF Library is closed, some students may not have reliable access to\nthe internet or a computer. If that is the case, alternate options can be\nprovided, in addition to other computer labs on campus.\n\nStudents can reach out to Students with Disabilities Services or their\nprofessors for accommodations.\n\n### Most Viewed\n\n  1.

 * __ Print\n\nIn order to keep busy during quarantine, Auburn students have been getting\ncreative as to how to spend their time in between Panopto lectures and Zoom\nclass meetings.\n\nOn March 20, the University that they will not resume on-campus classes. Amid\nthe coronavirus outbreak, Auburn hoped to promote social distancing by\nreducing the amount of people on campus.\n\nMost students have opted to stay home since the University\u2019s initial\nannouncement during spring break to move to online classes until April 10,\nwhile other students have continued to live in their apartments in Auburn.\n\nLanie Whorms, sophomore in accounting, said being in her major has kept her\nbusy with school work during this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had like three exams and a project already, so I\u2019ve been kind of busy,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nBesides school work, Whorms said she also does a variety of activities like\nreading, using social media and watching movies.\n\n\u201cI cook a lot,\" she said. \"I now have time to cook and try different recipes,\nso I\u2019ve been doing that a lot more.\"\n\n* * *\n\n#### Sign up for our newsletter\n\nGet The Plainsman straight to your inbox.\n\n* * *\n\nTo get fresh air, Whorms said she will read outside on her porch, go for a run\nor go for a walk.\n\n\u201cA run or a walk helps keep me motivated too,\" Whorms said. \"It pushes me to\ndo more things and stay active.\"\n\nSimilar to Whorms, Cecily Anderson, sophomore in environmental design, said\nthat she has also been trying to spend more time outside.\n\n \u201cGoing for walks is nice,\" Anderson said. \"I go outside to take walks or go\nfor a hike.\u201d\n\nBesides taking naps or watching \u201ca good bit of Hulu and Netflix,\u201d Anderson\nsaid that she has been attempting to explore her passion for art more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to motivate myself to get back into making art, but it\u2019s hard to\ncommit to much with everything going on,\" she said.\n\nAnderson, who chose to go home for the quarantine, has also been enjoying the\ncompany of her family.\n\n\u201cI watch movies and TV shows with my family a couple nights a week, and we\nusually eat dinner together,\" Anderson said. \u201cI think we are doing a pretty\ngood job of making sure everyone has alone time so we don\u2019t end up getting\nsick of each other.\"\n\nBoth girls stated that finding the motivation to do school work and other\nactivities is hard while at home.  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really that hard to come up with things to do \u2014 I think my main\nproblem is staying motivated to do them,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nWhorms added that being at home has really shortened her attention span.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really easy to get distracted when you\u2019re just sitting at home,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cMy attention span is a lot shorter than I thought it was. I\u2019ll get\na message on my phone and go off track for 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nSocial distancing has been straining people's social lives and businesses,\nwhich means people need to make more of an effort during this time, Whorms\nsaid.  \n\n\u201cPeople are also calling each other a lot more, so FaceTime is important now,\nand then another thing people have been doing is making sure they support\ntheir local businesses,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite these challenges, Anderson and Whorms both said that they think social\ndistancing is important to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAnderson said that while she wishes she could be back in Auburn, she knows\nthat for now she needs to practice healthy habits and make the best of the\nsituation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing an unprecedented reality, and we don\u2019t know just how bad the\nvirus can get,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nIt is also important to be careful during this time in order to ensure the\nhealth and quality of life of other people, Whorms said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not safe and don\u2019t practice social distancing, you never know who\nyou could possibly affect,\u201d Whorms said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to stay away from\nmy grandparents, and I have a friend that has an autoimmune disorder so I\u2019ve\nstayed away from her because I don\u2019t want to get anyone else sick.\u201d\n\n## Share\n\n  * [__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2020/04/how-auburn-students-keep-busy-during-coronavirus-quarantine)\n  * [__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Auburn%20students%20stay%20busy%20during%20coronavirus%20quarantine&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theplainsman.com%2Farticle%2F2020%2F04%2Fhow-auburn-students-keep-busy-during-coronavirus-quarantine)\n  * [__](mailto:?subject=How Auburn students stay busy during coronavirus quarantine%20theplainsman.com%20%7C%20The%20Auburn%20Plainsman&body=Hi%20there%2C%0A%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20on%20The%20Auburn%20Plainsman%0Ahttps://www.theplainsman.com/article/2020/04/how-auburn-students-keep-busy-during-coronavirus-quarantine)\n  * __\n\n**Do you like this story?** The Plainsman doesn't accept money from tuition or\nstudent fees, and we don't charge a subscription fee.

Rebecca Coombes, head of news and views\n\n  1. The BMJ\n\n  1. rcoombes{at}bmj.com\n\nCity metro systems, including the London Underground, are heeding government\nadvice and reducing services to cope with all but essential travel to help\nslow the spread of covid-19 in major UK centres. But experts are questioning\nthe need to shut down services completely.\n\nAdam Kucharski, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and\nTropical Medicine (LSHTM), said that there was no clear evidence that\ncommuters travelling on the underground were at greater risk. Speaking at an\nevent in London this week, he pointed to research from Public Health England\nand the LSHTM, published in 2014.1 \u201cThis large scale survey of behaviour in\nthe community found no evidence of an association of increased influenza-like\nillness risk to people who used public transport relative to other forms of\ntransport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is still a lot we don\u2019t know about this infection, we do know\nthat each person who is infectious is giving it to, on average, 2-3 others. So\nif you think of proximity of contact and how many people are taking the tube\nin London versus the intense contact you have at home, it can\u2019t be the case\nthat of the 20-30 people we\u2019re passing a day, a high proportion of those is\ngetting infected. Because then you would have a much higher reproduction\nnumber. It\u2019s different from something like measles, where if someone sneezes,\neveryone susceptible in the vicinity will get it.\u201d\n\nHe told the Global Health Laboratory event, run by the LSHTM and the _Lancet_\n, that closing the tube would not be as effective as a quarantine of\nhouseholds. \u201cBecause of the value of reproduction number, it suggests that\nmore prolonged, close-knit, interaction, maybe with physical contact, creates\nmore opportunities to pick things up and will likely come with a higher\ntransmission based on initial indirect evidence.\u201d\n\nDavid Heymann, however, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at\nLSHTM, also speaking at the event, cautioned that the virus was acting in\nunpredictable ways. \u201cThere have been some major explosive events of\ntransmission, which seem to be based on rather casual contact; for example,\nchurches where there has been close contact and an instance in Wuhan where\nthere was an explosive outbreak. I don\u2019t think there is much understood about\nhow they occurred, but it seems that people just in the vicinity became\ninfected. We don\u2019t really understand the characteristics of this virus, which\nsometimes allows it to transmit in explosive ways,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the UK, the government and Transport for London are advising against all\nbut \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d travel in London. Metro systems in Newcastle and\nLiverpool are also running a reduced service following public health advice.\n\nWatch the Global Health Laboratory event (What is the best way to stop a\npandemic?) here:\n<https://panopto.lshtm.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bd181e3b-2ae8-4804-beaa-\nab7300bfa1e3>\n\n## References\n\n  1. \u21b5\n\n    1.

[Ashley\nAhn](https://www.thedp.com/staff/ashley-ahn) 03/11/20 3:14pm\n\n[

[Sukhmani\nKaur](https://www.thedp.com/staff/sukhmani-kaur)\n\nPenn will extend spring break for one week and move all classes online\nbeginning March 23 to the end of the spring semester, in an effort to limit\nthe spread of the coronavirus.\n\nProvost Wendell Pritchett and President Amy Gutmann sent an email to **** the\nPenn **** community **** on Wednesday, instructing students who are off campus\nfor spring break not to return. The email instructed students on campus to\nmove out by March 15, adding that University staff will be available to help\ndeparting students.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nPritchett and Gutmann wrote that the University will work with students who\nare currently off-campus to facilitate the return of their belongings. They\nadded that the University will support students who receive financial aid\nduring this transition.\n\nMedical, Dental, Veterinary, and some Nursing students will continue their\nclinical rotations and will receive information with further instruction from\ntheir respective Deans, they wrote.\n\nAll on-campus activities will be limited, according to the email.\n\nVice Provost for Education Beth Winkelstein wrote in [an email to all teaching\nfaculty](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/online-classes-penn-\ncoronavirus-preparation) on March 9 that Panopto is used for recording\nlectures, while Zoom and BlueJeans work best for discussion-based seminars.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nPenn's plan to move classes online follows [similar policies by other Ivy\nLeague universities](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-coronavirus-\nivy-league-online-classes-travel).\n\n  \n\nPeer institutions such as [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/covid-19-moving-\nclasses-online-other-updates),\n[Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/content/covid-19-coronavirus-\ninformation), and [Yale](https://communications.yale.edu/covid-19-information)\nannounced classes will be conducted online after spring break. Harvard has\nasked students to [move out of their\ndorms](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/us/harvard-students-coronavirus-\ntrnd/index.html) with a five-day\u2019s notice and will move to virtual classes for\nthe rest of the semester. Princeton and Yale will hold online classes until at\nleast April 5, when they will reassess their coronavirus policies.\n\n[Pritchett also announced](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/coronavirus-\npenn-travel-banned-large-events-online-classes) Tuesday that all University-\nrelated international and domestic travel is banned until April 17, unless\napproved by the provost. All on-campus events with more than 100 people\nscheduled through April 17 must be postponed or canceled.\n\nPritchett's announcement follows the Pennsylvania Department of Health's\nreport that a Montgomery County, Pa. resident, who tested positive for\ncoronavirus, [is being treated at the Hospital of the University of\nPennsylvania](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/coronavirus-hospital-\nuniversity-pennsylvania-penn-treatment). The patient, a Children\u2019s Hospital of\nPhiladelphia cardiologist, is in critical condition, health officials\nannounced on March 9.  \n\n###### Sign up for our newsletter\n\nGet our newsletter, _Dear Penn_ , delivered to your inbox every weekday\nmorning.\n\nSign Up\n\n  \n  \n\nOn Wednesday, the World Health Organization\n[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/coronavirus-news.html)\nthe coronavirus outbreak qualifies as a global pandemic because of its\nsustained transmission on six continents.\n\nDean of Admissions Eric Furda [announced last\nweek](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-quaker-days-canceled-\ncoronavirus) that next month's Quaker Days events will be canceled. Quaker\nDays annually brings newly admitted students to Penn before making their final\ncollege decisions.\n\nIn an email sent to School of Arts and Sciences spring 2020 instructors on\nMarch 9, College Dean Steven Fluharty, College Dean Paul Sniegowski, Associate\nDean of Graduate Studies Beth Wenger, and Vice Dean for Professional and\nLiberal Education Nora Lewis urged teachers to \"keep [online courses] simple\"\nand to \"use the Penn-recommended tools that [they] are most comfortable with\nto accomplish [their] course needs in the most straightforward way.\"\n\n##

price target\n\n**Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM)** is attracting attention with its\ninvaluable video conferencing technology amidst the \"social distancing\" and\nquarantine trends triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. With that in mind,\nNeedham initiated coverage on ZM with a \"buy\" rating and a $140 price target.\nThe communication platform has become even handier for businesses and\ninstructors as software name Panopto pushed for Zoom sessions to be easily\nrecorded and shared. ZM is down 1% to trade at $106.75 at last check.\n\nZM has steady support from its 30-day moving average and touched a record high\nof $129.83 on March 5. The equity is up 58.5% year-to-date, but there still\nremains room for bull notes to enter the ring. Coming into today, 10 out of 18\ncovering firms sport a tepid \"hold,\" and one sports a \"strong sell.\"\n\nIn the options pits, calls heavily outweigh puts. At the International\nSecurities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX\n(PHLX), 1.88 calls have been bought for every put in the last 10 days. This\nafternoon, 11,000 calls have crossed the tape so far, compared to only 4,000\nputs, with the March 115 call the most popular.\n\nIn the last two reporting periods, short interest has risen 40.4% to 11.61\nmillion shares, making up 36.1% of the stock's available float. At the\nequity's average pace of daily trading, it would take just over two days for\nshorts to buy back their bearish bets.\n\n[Follow @Schaeffers](https://twitter.com/Schaeffers)\n\n  \nA Schaeffer's exclusive!\n\nThe Expert's Guide\n\nAccess your **FREE** trading earning announcements before it's too late!\n\n  \n**VIEW SPECIAL REPORT**\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Browse By Topic\n\n  * [Analyst Update](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/analyst-update)\n  * [Best and Worst Stocks](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/best-and-worst-stocks)\n  * [Most Active Weekly Options](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/most-active-weekly-options)\n  * [Options Recommendations](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/options-recommendations)\n  * [Quantitative Analysis](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/quantitative-analysis)\n  * [Stocks On the Move](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/stocks-on-the-move)\n  * [Strategies and Concepts](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/strategies-and-concepts)\n  * [VIX and Volatility](https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/-in-category/categories/vix-and-volatility)\n\n[View All Articles By Date](/content)\n\nPartnercenter\n\n* * *\n\n**NEW!** Explore Schaeffer's Partners' deals and get connected to top online\nbrokerages with deals tailored exclusively for our readers.

This\nStory\")Share via Email[Print](//pittnews.com/article/156462/news/students-\nprofessors-complete-first-day-of-online-classes//?print=true)\n\nSpring has arrived \u2014 and, with it, the start of online classes at Pitt.\n\nVirtual instruction began at the University on Monday after an [extended\nbreak](https://pittnews.com/article/156087/featured/pitt-moves-classes-online-\nas-coronavirus-pandemic-spreads-around-nation/). Professors are utilizing a\nvariety of platforms that the University has provided, ranging from Panopto,\nan online lecture system through CourseWeb, to Zoom, a video-conferencing\nprogram that allows professors to teach in real time. Instructors are also\nposting assignments and discussion boards on Canvas and Blackboard.\n\nChanning Parker, a visiting assistant instructor in the statistics department,\nsaid using the online teaching programs during her classes on Monday went well\nand that the biggest problems in moving classes online arose during planning.\nParker teaches three sections of Basic Applied Statistics with about 88\nstudents in each class.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple small technical problems with getting the sound to start\nworking and with figuring out how to use Panopto, but after I figured\neverything out, it wasn\u2019t too bad. The hardest part was the week before today,\nlearning how to move everything online and how to use all of these new\nsoftwares very quickly,\u201d Parker said.\n\nRachel Sadeh, a first-year studying psychology, said even though the shift to\nvirtual learning has been accompanied by changes to class syllabi and the\nintroduction of new online learning programs, all of her classes on Monday\nwent smoothly.\n\n\u201cThe stress level hasn\u2019t changed much, but everything feels very different,\u201d\nSadeh said. \u201cI still prefer being in the lecture hall and not staring into a\ncomputer screen, but it is nice not having to leave the comfort of my home.\u201d\n\nRather than strictly synchronous lectures, Alison Patterson, a lecturer in the\nEnglish department, set up her Children and Media class on Canvas with\nprerecorded presentations and lectures students can view on their own time.\nShe explained she is being careful to not overwhelm her students with too much\nnew information or projects at once.\n\n\u201cIn my usual online classes I\u2019ve built in creative production elements\nthroughout but this is unanticipated. It\u2019s not the time to increase demands on\nour students,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nPatterson explained that she chose not to hold class over Zoom due to concerns\nabout students\u2019 ability to find a quiet space at a set time. She also did not\nwant students in a different time zone to worry about attending class.\n\nParker and Patterson both described the challenges presented by not being\nface-to-face with students in the same physical space. Patterson worried about\nlectures not being nearly as engaging while Parker expressed concern about\nhelping students with difficult concepts online.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk through problems with the students nearly as easily. I am very\nmuch a visual explainer, which has posed a challenge for me,\u201d Parker said.\n\nKatie Carr, a sophomore majoring in public and professional writing, explained\nthat her Drawing Studio 1 course changed drastically, as her class can no\nlonger meet to work together.\n\n\u201cWe relied on studio time to practice and critique each other\u2019s work. Now I\nwill just draw two more pieces and submit photos of them online,\u201d Carr said.\n\nCarr also expressed worry over the change to class structures, specifically\nabout managing her time.\n\n\u201cI am someone that needs structure to help me stay focused,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI use\nlists and a planner but still do my best when I am in face-to-face classes\nwhere we can easily ask questions and talk about assignments.\u201d\n\nParker said staying focused without physical classes to teach is also a big\nissue for her. She suggested that anyone concerned with staying on task should\nset aside specific times to complete classwork and stick to them.\n\n\u201cI am easily distracted, and it is also difficult to get motivation when you\nare cooped up inside,\u201d Parker said. \u201cMaking a day-to-day schedule for myself\nhas made it much easier for me to manage my time.\u201d\n\nCarr said she is grateful for the effort and support that professors are\ngiving students.\n\n\u201cMy professors have been adaptable and supportive and offer virtual office\nhours for any concerns we have,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThey are doing the best they can\nunder the circumstances we are living in, and I applaud them for that.\u201d\n\n### Leave a comment.\n\n  * [canvas](https://pittnews.com/article/tag/canvas/)\n  * [Coronavirus](https://pittnews.com/article/tag/coronavirus/)\n  * [courseweb](https://pittnews.com/article/tag/courseweb/)\n  * [online classes](https://pittnews.com/article/tag/online-classes/)\n  * [zoom](https://pittnews.com/article/tag/zoom/)\n\nAbout the Writer\n\n[Elise Roessner, Staff\nWriter](https://pittnews.com/article/staff_profile/elise-roessner/)\n\nNavigate Left\n\n  * [![Students, professors complete first day of online classes](https://pittnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1587-316x475.jpg)](https://pittnews.com/article/156947/featured/pittsburgh-buildings-light-up-in-support-of-front-line-pandemic-workers/#photo)\n\n2\\.

The transition to online education has gone\nfairly smoothly, according to faculty and students.\n\n\"The first day was amazingly successful,\" says Dr. Richard Wlezien, vice\nprovost and dean of the College of Engineering and Computing at Missouri S&T.\n\"Our faculty had 95% of their courses ready to teach online.\"\n\nThat means that many professors had to become familiar with online instruction\ntools quickly. Dr. Greg Hilmas, chair of materials science and engineering,\nsays that at least half of the department faculty, including himself, had\nnever taught a course online.\n\n\"Learning to use Canvas, Panopto and Zoom within a matter of days was a major\nchallenge that everyone was able to work through, and it's going well,\" he\nsays. \"Labs, of course, cannot be 'hands-on' using only online activities. So\nthe faculty and graduate students are demonstrating the labs via video capture\nand then providing real data for the students to utilize as they write their\nlab reports.\"\n\nDr. Daryl Beetner, chair of electrical and computer engineering, says\ndepartment faculty members are sharing their expertise with each other.\n\n\"The faculty who have not taught online are able to lean on those who have\nexperience in distance teaching for support,\" Beetner says. \"Also, Missouri\nS&T has created online resources available for all faculty to provide a 'one-\nstop shop' for information about distance teaching, which also helps.\"\n\nDr. Shun Saito, a physics professor in the College of Arts, Sciences, and\nBusiness, is teaching his astrophysics classes on Zoom. Saito shares his\nhandwritten notes using his iPad and shows PowerPoint slides using his laptop.\nStudents ask questions only through the chat function, and Saito answers as he\nsees the questions.\n\n\"Everything works smoothly from my point of view, and a few students I asked\nseem to like the lecture,\" Saito says.\n\nStudents had to get used to the new format as well. While most at S&T are\ntech-savvy, they have had to learn to use programs they may not have used in\nthe past.\n\n\"Some of my classmates had never taken an online course before,\" says Brandon\nBroughton, a senior who is hoping to graduate in August with a bachelor's\ndegree in English. \"The professors were accommodating during the initial week\nwhile students got used to taking classes online.\"\n\nBroughton says there are benefits and challenges to online coursework.\n\n\"Online classes are more flexible and free up time for other things,\" he says.\n\"But I realized that traditional classes provide a structure that I've had to\nbuild for myself to keep up with assignments. It's easy to take that structure\nfor granted.\"\n\nGraduate student Michele White is studying electrical engineering. She agrees\nthat online courses have some trade-offs.\n\n\"I miss the opportunity to ask my professor questions during a live class,\nbecause our lectures are recorded,\" White says. \"On the other hand, I can\npause the lecture any time, so I never miss any information.\"\n\nFor the first week of online courses, March 16-20, there were no penalties for\nmissed connections, assignments, tests or quizzes. Students and faculty can\nget the latest updates and access to online resources through a website\nprovided by S&T: keeplearning.mst.edu.\n\nSome students and faculty members face the challenge of weak or no internet\nconnectivity at their remote work and study locations. Missouri S&T's\ninformation technology department is working to obtain equipment that can\nimprove access to the internet for faculty and students. In addition, many\ninternet service providers are offering low-cost internet plans and Wi-Fi hot\nspots in their communities for students. Missouri S&T is also providing\nlaptops for some students to enable them to access virtual courses from remote\nlocations.\n\n## Never miss a story\n\nChoose the plan that's right for you.  \nDigital access or digital and print delivery.\n\n[Subscribe\nNow](https://www.therolladailynews.com/subscribenow?g2i_source=therolladailynews.com&g2i_medium=subscribe&g2i_campaign=footer)\n\n## Sign up for daily e-mails\n\n#### Site Services __\n\n  * [Support Local Businesses](https://supportlocal.usatoday.com)\n  * [My Profile](http://myprofile.therolladailynews.com/page.aspx?QS=c76003443ff9837d08393c4559ff8a1b86d1a2da672edbd7&PROD_CODE=GTAO_RDN)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.therolladailynews.com/section/?template=contact)\n  * [Purchase Photos](http://therolladailynews.mycapture.com/mycapture/index.asp)\n  * [Place an Ad](http://adportal.marketplaceadsonline.com/gatehouse-adportal/morol-classified/index.html)\n  * [Engagement Announcement](https://www.therolladailynews.com/submit)\n  * [Anniversary Announcement](https://www.therolladailynews.com/submit)\n  * [Subscribe](https://www.therolladailynews.com/onlinesubscription)\n  * [Advertise With Us](http://mediakit.gatehousemedia.com/Rolla-StJames_MO)\n\n#### Market Place __\n\n  * [Classifieds](http://www.marketplaceadsonline.com/marketplace/MoRol)\n  * [Cars](https://www.therolladailynews.com/section/cars)\n  * [FindNSave](http://findnsave.therolladailynews.com/)\n  * [Boats Magazine](http://lakemedia.mo.newsmemory.com/specials_page2.php)\n  * [Pay Your Ad Bill ](https://www.therolladailynews.com/pay-your-ad-bill)\n\n#### Community Info __\n\n  * [Rolla Chamber of Commerce](http://www.rollachamber.org)\n  * [University of Missouri Science and Technology](http://www.mst.edu/)\n  * [Rotary Club - Rolla](http://www.rollarotary.org/)\n  * [Rolla Lions Club](http://www.rollalions.org/)\n  * [Optimists Club](http://www.rollanet.org/~optimist/)\n  * [More Community Links](https://www.therolladailynews.com/homepage/x313685810/Community-Links)\n\n#### Communities __\n\n  * [City of Rolla](http://www.rollacity.org)\n  * [Newburg Missouri](http://www.newburgmo.org)\n  * [Phelps County](http://www.phelpscounty.org/)\n\n(C) Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.

(Isaac Lawrence/AFP\nvia Getty Images)\n\nBy [ Emily Matchar ](/author/emily-matchar/)\n\nsmithsonianmag.com  \nMarch 9, 2020\n\nIn the video, my son's preschool teacher is sitting alone in an empty\nclassroom, surrounded by wooden toy blocks. \"When I am building, do I put the\nsmall block down and then the big block?\" she asks the camera. \"Or do I put\nthe big block and then the small block?\"\n\nMy 3-year-old son is lounging on the couch, half watching, half flipping\nthrough a pop-up book. He's dressed in a fleece shark costume, his preferred\nattire when not forced to wear his school uniform.\n\nThis is what \"school\" looks like these days here in Hong Kong. Because of the\ncoronavirus outbreak, all schools, including my son's private bilingual\npreschool, have been closed since January, and won't reopen until late April\nat the earliest. \"The exact date of class resumption is subject to further\nassessment,\" [announced](https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/sch-\nadmin/admin/about-sch/diseases-prevention/edb_20200225_eng.pdf) the Education\nBureau, which controls all schools in Hong Kong, public and private, on\nFebruary 25. It's all part of the \"[social\ndistancing](https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/04/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-what-is-social-distancing/)\" measures the city has mandated to slow\nthe virus's spread, which include closing libraries, museums and recreation\nfacilities like pools. **** Students from preschoolers through PhD candidates\nare now doing all their education online, a move the Education Bureau calls\n\"[suspending classes without suspending\nlearning](https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/sch-admin/admin/about-\nsch/diseases-prevention/edb_20200225_eng.pdf).\"\n\nAs coronavirus spreads across the globe, other countries are joining Hong Kong\nand mainland China in this massive, unplanned experiment in online learning.\nAccording to [Unesco](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-\nemergencies/coronavirus-school-closures), as of Friday, 14 countries have shut\nschools down nationwide, affecting upwards of 290 million students, while 13\ncountries, including the United States, have seen localized school closings.\nIn recent days, schools from Scarsdale, New York, to San Francisco have\n[closed\ntemporarily](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/03/03/coronavirus-\nschools-closing-online-florida-washington-california/4928377002/) over\ncontagion concerns. The University of Washington and Stanford University have\n[turned to online classes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/coronavirus-\ncollege-campus-closings.html) for the remainder of the quarter, and others are\nfollowing suit for various lengths of time. Some [experts\nbelieve](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-coronavirus-\nschools-20200304-det2vukdfrdurbk3zatbzxz6fa-story.html) more widespread and\nlong-term closures will be necessary in areas with high levels of community\ntransmission. States are [preparing for that\npossibility](https://edsource.org/2020/california-k-12-schools-prepare-for-\ncoronavirus-related-closures/624676) by looking at their own online learning\npolicies.\n\n![Hong Kong teacher edits video lesson.jpg](https://thumbs-prod.si-\ncdn.com/yDWTmcDgotgkc62p9MstSgv8hX8=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-\ncdn.com/filer/a0/f4/a0f4f7a8-33be-48a6-bae1-e59923ef2c86/hong_kong_teacher_edits_video_lesson.jpg)\nA teacher edits a video lesson he recorded for his students. (Isaac\nLawrence/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut what does online learning involve here in Hong Kong? It depends. The city\nbenefits from [high internet penetration](https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-\npublications/english/1718issh26-digital-inclusion-in-hong-\nkong-20180604-e.pdf)--90 percent of citizens over 10 years old are online. But\nbeyond that it gets more complicated. The city has a diverse variety of\nschools, from free government-run schools to partially subsidized English-\nlanguage schools for non-Cantonese speakers to private religious and\ninternational schools. Hong Kong has no specific online curriculum, so ****\nschools are cobbling together their own solutions using a myriad of platforms\nand apps, from [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h), a free\nweb service for assigning and sharing work, to\n[BrainPOP](https://www.brainpop.com/), a site offering animated educational\nvideos. Some students are expected to work alongside their classmates in real\ntime. Others are allowed to watch pre-recorded videos or complete emailed\nworksheets at their own pace. Some parents are happy with their setups. Others\nhave taken to Facebook to commiserate over \"mommy needs wine\" memes. The\nsituation can give some insight into what Americans might expect as some\nschools transition to online learning.\n\n\"I've been working from home the past four weeks, and it's been incredibly\ninsightful to actually see what's going on, because normally I'm not in\nschool,\" says Anna Adasiewicz, a business development manager originally from\nPoland, who has lived in Hong Kong for 16 years. **** Her 12-year-old daughter\nattends a subsidized English-language school run by the [English Schools\nFoundation](https://www.esf.edu.hk), which runs 22 schools in Hong Kong.\n\nUnlike my son and his shark costume, Adasiewicz's daughter is expected to be\n\"[dressed appropriately](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-\nkong/education/article/3050532/no-pyjamas-online-lessons-hong-kong-pupils-\nextended-break)\" and sit at a table, not a couch, when she logs on to [Google\nClassroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h) each morning. Her school has\nbeen using the free service to share assignments, monitor progress, and let\nstudents and teachers chat. They're also doing interactive lessons via Google\nHangouts Meet, a virtual-meeting software [made\nfree](https://www.engadget.com/2020/03/03/google-makes-hangouts-meet-features-\nfree-in-the-wake-of-coronavirus/) in the wake of the coronavirus.\n\n\"I actually think she's more focused with this approach,\" Adasiewicz says.\n\"She's not distracted by other kids. The class sizes are normally about 30, so\nI imagine a typical teacher spends a good portion of the time on behavior\nmanagement. Here the teacher can mute anyone!\"\n\nCat Lao, a special education classroom assistant, whose daughters are 3, 6 and\n8, has also been happy with the experience. Her youngest daughter is in a\nlocal preschool while her older two attend an English Schools Foundation\nprimary school. Her middle daughter has been using the\n[Seesaw](https://web.seesaw.me/) app to share assignments with her teacher and\nreceive feedback. Her eldest daughter has been using Google Classroom and\n[Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/), an app that lets teachers set topics\nor questions for students to respond to via video. This child especially\nappreciates the real-time [Google Meets](https://meet.google.com/_meet), Lao\nsays, since she misses the social aspects of school.\n\n\"They're still learning, and still part of their community as much as they can\nbe,\" she says.\n\nBut many parents are not happy to find themselves working as de facto part-\ntime teachers.\n\n\"For parents who have to work from home, managing school can be quite a task,\"\nsays Pragati Mor, a teacher and mother of two young daughters who attend the\nFrench International School of Hong Kong.\n\nHer children's online learning program has been full of technological\nglitches, Mor says, which requires taking time from her own workday to fuss\nwith unfamiliar programs.\n\n\"It needs adult supervision,\" she says. \"It can be quite daunting.\"\n\nSusan Bridges, an education professor at the University of Hong Kong who\nstudies online learning, admits, \"It's a challenge; lots of parents are having\nto adjust their lifestyles to what feels like homeschooling.\"\n\nResearch\n[shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219300433)\nthat it's more difficult to keep students motivated online, which means\nteachers need to mix up their strategies, Bridges says. This can include\nmaking lectures shorter, and incorporating real-time quizzes and online small\ngroup work. Another problem is testing. If a teacher had planned a proctored\nexam, they may need to switch to an unsupervised type of assessment instead,\nsuch as a term paper. Then there's the question of hands-on learning, which is\nespecially important in some higher education fields, such as medicine or\nspeech pathology.\n\n\"All of that field work that's essential for our professional and clinical\nprograms, all of these are very difficult to replace, so that's a big\nchallenge,\" Bridges says.\n\nCharles Baker, the owner of an English-language tutoring center in Hong Kong's\nNew Territories district, has had to think outside the box to make online\nlearning successful. Before coronavirus hit, he'd already begun using a\nvirtual classroom platform called [WizIQ](https://www.wiziq.com/) to connect\nhis students with classrooms in Southeast Asia, as a sort of online exchange\nprogram. This put him in a better position than many to jump directly to\nonline learning, he says. The main challenge is keeping young children engaged\nwithout the physical presence of a teacher. To deal with this, he's shortened\nclass lengths from an hour to 30 minutes for his 5- and 6-year-old students.\n\n\"I think this situation is a really great opportunity for people to be\nutilizing technology in a more fundamental kind of way,\" he says.\n\nSuccessful online learning is all about \"engagement and interaction,\" Bridges\nsays. **** The University of Hong Kong has been helping its professors create\nmore dynamic online learning environments using video meeting platforms like\n[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and recording technology like\n[Panopto](https://www.panopto.com/), which make it possible to insert quizzes,\nPowerPoints and captions into pre-recorded lectures. Beyond that, class\nformats have been up to the individual professors.\n\nBut, as Bridges points out, privacy and space are major concerns. Professors\nare discovering that students won't turn on their video cameras because\nthey're embarrassed to be sitting in their childhood bedrooms in front of old\nK-Pop posters. Zoom has a solution for this, as Bridges demonstrates to me.\nShe turns on a digital background and suddenly she appears to be in a sunny,\nminimalist office, a potted plant on the desk behind her. Other than a slight\npixilation of her face, it looks pretty real.\n\n\"These are just little fix-its,\" she says.\n\nStill, a digital background can't change the stresses of multiple people\nlearning and working in Hong Kong's [notoriously tiny](https://medium.com/re-\nform/the-micro-dwellings-of-hong-kong-891764164a30) apartments.\n\n\"It's crowded, it's complicated, there are demands on technology,\" says\nAdasiewicz, whose husband, a lawyer, has also been working from home. \"We had\nto update our router.\"\n\n![A woman and a boy wear masks as they play basketball in Hong\nKong.jpg](https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/KGuEebg1db0xU3jrCOeRNB813tg=/fit-\nin/1072x0/https://public-media.si-\ncdn.com/filer/de/54/de54bfc2-04fb-4ca8-a5e4-1c97e175615c/a_woman_and_a_boy_wear_masks_as_they_play_basketball_in_hong_kong.jpg)\nA woman and a boy wear a mask as they play basketball on February 27, 2020, in\nHong Kong. (Vernon Yuen/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nChildcare is a major issue as well. Many Hong Kongers are now returning to\ntheir offices after an extended period of working remotely, leaving children\nat home in front of screens. Some rely on their nannies--nearly [half of Hong\nKong families](https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-\npublications/english/1617rb04-foreign-domestic-helpers-and-evolving-care-\nduties-in-hong-kong-20170720-e.pdf) with children and a working mother employ\na live-in \"foreign domestic helper,\" usually from the Philippines or\nIndonesia. Other families count on grandparents for childcare, which means\nelderly caregivers who may not speak English must serve as tech support.\n\nAnd not all classes lend themselves to online education. It's hard to teach\nphysical education online, and missing out on exercise is a problem not only\nfor obesity rates but also for vision. Hong Kong has one of the [highest rates\nof myopia](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-\nreads/article/2085125/chinas-myopia-epidemic-why-simple-solution-being) (near-\nsightedness) in the world, with some [70 percent of kids over\n12](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/media/media_releases/index_id_2369.html)\nsuffering, and experts believe it's because children spend too much time\nindoors looking at close objects like books and tablets. For many kids, who\nlive in crowded housing estates with little green space, schools' tracks and\nrooftop basketball courts provide some of the few opportunities they have for\noutdoor play. Some schools are encouraging students to take frequent breaks to\ndo mini-exercises like a minute of [jumping jacks](https://www.esf.edu.hk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/ESF-home-learning-guide-2020.pdf).\n\nMany hope this experience will force Hong Kong schools to professionalize and\nstandardize their online curricula. This could potentially provide a template\nfor other cities and countries facing their own coronavirus school shutdowns.\n\n\"Could this crisis inspire the bureau [of education] to incorporate online\nlearning into the official curriculum and take Hong Kong education to the next\nlevel?\" [wondered](https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3049864/how-\ncoronavirus-crisis-could-help-hong-kongs-education-sector-move) Chak Fu Lam, a\nprofessor of management at the City University of Hong Kong, in a letter to\nthe editor of the _South China Morning Post_.\n\nAt the end of the day, most parents and teachers seem to understand the\nsituation is out of their control, and that everyone is doing the best they\ncan.\n\n\"We have to embrace technology,\" Adasiewicz says. \"It's coming our way whether\nwe like it or not.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it seems, so is coronavirus.\n\nLike this article?  \nSIGN UP for our newsletter\n\n[Privacy Policy](), [Terms of Use]()\n\n###### About Emily Matchar\n\n![Emily Matchar](https://thumbs-prod.si-\ncdn.com/4w-tz2iP_tCRjCtHf0X58OrjcT0=/fit-\nin/160x80/filters:no_upscale\\(\\)/https://public-media.si-\ncdn.com/accounts/headshot/Emily-Matchar-2.jpg)\n\nEmily Matchar is a writer based in Hong Kong and Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nHer work has appeared in _The New York Times_ , _The Atlantic_ , _The New\nRepublic_ , _The Washington Post_ and other publications.

Williams | March 13, 2020\n\nAs William & Mary students and faculty prepare to move to remote learning from\nMarch 23 through at least April 3 because of precautions surrounding the\nspread of COVID-19, the newly-established Studio for Teaching & Learning\nInnovation has set up a support system to assist faculty.\n\nStating that the studio's purpose \"is to provide strategic solutions and\ncreative ideas to assist in any situation,\" officials developed a plan for\ncollaboration among units and people across campus.\n\n\"While COVID-19 presents considerable challenges as we work to reimagine our\ncourses in a remote or online format, it also provides us with opportunities\nas a community of learners to take risks and explore new technology tools and\nresources,\" said Mark Hofer, director of the\n[studio](https://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/initiatives/teaching-\nand-learning/index.php) and professor of educational technology at the [School\nof Education.](https://education.wm.edu/)\n\n\"By serving as a collaborative partner with IT, university libraries and\neducational leaders across campus, we are working hard in STLI to meet faculty\nwhere they are and help them explore ways to support their students.\"\n\nStudio staff are currently in the process of equipping faculty with the\nresources and support needed to begin using remote learning most effectively\nin a short period of time. Among those efforts is a new website containing\nresources and teaching tips.\n\nThe [instructional resilience\nwebsite](https://instructionalresilience.gs.wm.edu) highlights communication\nstrategies, course material distribution, options for teaching classes online,\nlab activities, peer-to-peer collaboration among students, assignments, tests\nand quizzes, frequently asked questions and information on where to get\nadditional help.\n\nThe studio will also host tutorials that include videos and help guides; live\nwebinar sessions that focus on programs including Zoom, Blackboard, Panopto\nand student engagement strategies; and open office hours with team members in\nperson or online for in-depth assistance.\n\nAdditionally, studio officials are coordinating with [Information\nTechnology](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/index.php) and staff from [W&M\nLibraries](https://libraries.wm.edu/) to assist with any technical issues or\ndifficulties faculty may be experiencing in [teaching and working\nonline](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/remoteresources/index.php) as well as in\naccessing critical educational materials.\n\nThe Studio for Teaching & Learning Innovation was established in the fall of\n2019, integrating the pre-existing [eLearning\nInitiatives](https://www.wm.edu/offices/apel/) group. The initiative was\nchampioned by W&M President Katherine A. Rowe, who said at the time that\nfaculty members have expressed a strong desire to break through disciplinary\nsilos, adopt appropriate new technologies and more strongly unite with\ncolleagues across the campus and schools to advance teaching excellence.\n\nThe studio is designed to \"coordinate existing initiatives devoted to teaching\neffectiveness while creating new opportunities to ignite and incubate\ninnovative ideas and approaches, and to showcase these at our institution and\nbeyond,\" according to a report on its inception.\n\n  * [Home](../../../index.php)\n  * [News & Media](../../index.php)\n  * [More Stories](../index.php)\n  * [2020](index.php)\n\n  * [ email ](https://share.wm.edu?t=______PAGE_TITLE______&u=https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2020/wm-studio-for-teaching-learning-innovation-ramps-up-support-for-remote-learning.php)\n  * [ facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2020/wm-studio-for-teaching-learning-innovation-ramps-up-support-for-remote-learning.php&t=______PAGE_TITLE______)\n  * [ twitter ](https://twitter.com/home?status=______PAGE_TITLE______ : https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2020/wm-studio-for-teaching-learning-innovation-ramps-up-support-for-remote-learning.php)\n  * [ linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2020/wm-studio-for-teaching-learning-innovation-ramps-up-support-for-remote-learning.php&title=______PAGE_TITLE______)\n\n#### Related Links\n\n  * [W&M provides details on interim actions around COVID-19](wm-takes-interim-actions-on-instruction,-travel,-events-to-prevent-covid-19.php \"W&M provides details on interim actions around COVID-19\")\n  * [Emerging Diseases: A COLL 150 seminar tracks the COVID-19 outbreak in real time](emerging-diseases-a-coll-150-seminar-tracks-the-covid-19-outbreak-in-real-time.php \"Emerging Diseases: A COLL 150 seminar tracks the COVID-19 outbreak in real time\")\n  * [A coronavirus Q&A with a virologist](a-coronavirus-qa-with-a-virologist.php \"A coronavirus Q&A with a virologist\")\n\n#### Remote teaching\n\n[![Three people sit talk to each other](/news/_widgets/stli-covid/studio-\nwidget.jpg)](http://instructionalresilience.gs.wm.edu/)The Studio for Teaching\nand Learning Innovation has created a remote teaching resource website with\ntools, strategies and support for faculty members.\n[More...](http://instructionalresilience.gs.wm.edu/ \"More...\")\n\n[Social Stream](https://social.wm.edu) [W&M Blogs](/blogs)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/williamandmary \"Facebook\")\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/williamandmary \"Twitter\")\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/williamandmary \"YouTube\")  \n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=19598 \"LinkedIn\")\n[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/william-and-mary \"Flickr\")\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/william_and_mary \"Instagram\")\n\n[Alumni](/alumnigateway/index.php) [Current\nStudents](/currentstudents/index.php) [Employers](/employers/index.php)\n[Faculty & Staff](/facultystaff/index.php) [Parents &\nFamilies](/parentsandfamilies/index.php) [Friends &\nNeighbors](/friends/index.php) [Libraries](https://libraries.wm.edu) [Careers\nat W&M](/offices/hr/careers/index.php)\n[Policies](/offices/compliance/policies/index.php) [Consumer\nInformation](/offices/compliance/university-compliance-\nrequirement/consumer_information/index.php) [Emergency\nInformation](/about/administration/emergency/index.php) [Report\nConcerns](/report/index.php) [Accessibility](/sites/campusaccess/index.php)\n\n[ ![William & Mary](/img/wm_wordmark_single_line_white.png) ](/index.php)\n\nWilliamsburg, VA  \n[Contact Us](/contactus/index.php) [About this Site](/aboutthissite/index.php)\nAll Rights Reserved (C)\n\n"}, {"item": "Nothing on SMU's Campus is Normal Right Now - The Daily Campus", "link": "https://www.smudailycampus.com/ae/creative/nothing-on-smus-campus-is-normal-right-now", "guid": "CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtdWRhaWx5Y2FtcHVzLmNvbS9hZS9jcmVhdGl2ZS9ub3RoaW5nLW9uLXNtdXMtY2FtcHVzLWlzLW5vcm1hbC1yaWdodC1ub3fSAQA", "pubdate": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.smudailycampus.com/ae/creative/nothing-on-smus-campus-is-normal-right-now\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing on SMU's Campus is Normal Right Now</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Daily Campus</font>", "source": "The Daily Campus", "body": "You are being redirected...

Here\u2019s Why Self-Isolation Really Scares\nMe.\n\n## What happens if isolation becomes a new way of life?\n\nBy  [Steven W. Thrasher](/author/steven-w-thrasher)\n\nMarch 20, 20203:33 PM\n\nParisians chat on their balcony during the lockdown ordered by the French\ngovernment to combat the coronavirus on Wednesday.\n\nOmar Havana/Getty Images\n\nWhen I first considered the now-familiar phrases _self-isolation_ and _social\ndistancing_ , I felt frightened, because I live alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a habitually solitary person, it seemed like a counterintuitive reaction.\nI\u2019ve lived alone for about 15 years and have almost always been single. My\nparents are long deceased, as is much of my family of origin. I\u2019ve never lived\nwith a boyfriend, or even stayed with one for more than a few weeks while on\nholiday. I\u2019m a writer, and I am happy sitting in archives or drafting prose or\nreading for eight, 10, or 12 hours on any given day. When I visit other\npeople\u2019s homes during vacations, I find I need some significant alone time\nalmost every day.\n\nBut when I emerge from writing or research, I do\u2014like many introverts\u2014enjoy\nactually seeing other people. I _love_ being in public spaces. I love feeling\nat one with the cities of New York or Chicago or Athens by riding their metros\nand watching their people, silently observing what they are wearing and taking\njoy in their style and interactions. I love biking through traffic and getting\na feel for the rhythm of the day. I love teaching, and while the extroversion\nrequired can leave me tired afterward, I have recently discovered in my new\nlife as a college professor the joy of learning with students, both in the\nclassroom and one-on-one during office hours. (It is a joy that is especially\nsweet after many years of having spent way too much time staring at a computer\nscreen while writing a doctoral dissertation.) As a journalist, I love\ninterviewing people and listening to their stories, particularly when they\u2019re\ngathered at political rallies or on the march for justice. As a gay man, I\nlove finding and meeting other gay men, and getting to know their life stories\nin some bar, or in their bed or mine. ****\n\nAnd at the end of my writing days, I _do_ love spending time with and partying\nwith friends old and new\u2014whether we are meeting in caf\u00e9s talking about ideas,\nor out dancing together, or cooking together. I imagine this is a feeling akin\nto what others feel when they are eager to get home to more traditional\nfamilies. Governments are now banning large gatherings of people, as they\nshould.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who studies epidemics, I have been reading up a lot on social\ndistancing. I can understand its [clear\nbenefits](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/13/what-is-social-distancing/) and that\nit\u2019s an effective shared sacrifice for the public good, even though [what\nexactly social distancing means is up for\ndebate](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-\ndoes-social-distancing-mean/607927/). But as we are encouraged to self-\nisolate, I am mindful that some of us are going home to families that\u2014while\nnot always offering the idealized, imagined safety of the \u201cthe bosom of the\nfamily\u201d\u2014will still offer a chance for _some_ socialization, even if it\u2019s\npotentially harmful (more on that later). And I am also mindful that, for\npeople like me, all the socializing I do takes place either _outside_ of my\nhome or involves people who don\u2019t live with me _traveling_ to my home. And\nonce those modes of socialization are cut off, I will be totally alone. Mental\nhealth is health, and being aware of how isolation will affect the mental\nhealth of single people\u2014especially those less socially engaged than I am\u2014is of\nmajor importance in this pandemic.\n\nBut even beyond this, I am concerned about what this radical shift in\nsocialization will mean for all of us in the future. My study of prisons warns\nabout the increasing isolation and the mandatory substitution of screen-based\ntechnology for human contact that incarcerated and legally enslaved people are\nalready subjected to. My study of AIDS history tells me how activists have\nfought another virus for decades but reminds me that a major tool in that\nfight, gathering physical bodies in public space, is becoming nearly\nimpossible. Temporary isolation as a means to ending or curbing this plague is\none thing, but what if what it takes for the people of Earth to fight this\nplague leaves us in a place of increased alienation in the long term?\n\n###  \u201cHome Detention\u201d\n\nThere is no shortage of ironies and absurdities about the current crisis,\namong them the idea that sending people home from offices and schools\nautomatically makes them safer. While social distancing will \u201cmake the public\nbody safer,\u201d as my friend Adia Benton puts it, \u201cit might make individual\nbodies less safe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenton is a professor of anthropology at Northwestern University who studies\npublic health and infectious disease outbreaks. When I saw her\n[tweet](https://twitter.com/Ethnography911/status/1237860836162461696) that\nshe\u2019d \u201cfeel better about isolation and distance if I felt other strategies\nwere also in place to actually find out who is sick. Like I gotta get\npneumonia before anyone suspects anything?\u201d I called her up to ask her about\nit.\n\nHer concern echoed a concern of mine: How safe is it having families together\nin their homes? Apart from those with [first-responder\nrelatives](https://twitter.com/RachelPatzerPhD/status/1239726900446191617),\nmost families are not going to maintain social distancing with one another the\nway friends or strangers might. Parents are going to hug their children and\nchange their diapers. Partners are going to keep sleeping in the same beds.\nMight families be where the epidemic spreads? Benton has been reading the\nresearch and notes that when you look at China, people were \u201cgetting infected\nin clusters in their houses.\u201d\n\nAdding that \u201chome becomes a kind of detention center\u201d in these situations, she\nsaid that while discussion often focuses on the household structure of a\nnuclear family, people really live in all kinds of situations in homes\u2014with\nroommates or extended family or professional caregivers, often with some\npeople who may be coming or going even if some household members isolate. This\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily protect people within each home,\u201d Benton says, though it\n\u201cdoes bring down the curve overall.\u201d\n\nThis reminds me of how [research in\n2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-014-0862-4) (conducted\nbefore a drug was available that could prevent HIV in negative men) showed\nthat gay men who were in romantic relationships were at a higher risk for HIV\nthan single gay men. Because gay men in couples imagined that their romantic\nrelationship provided prophylaxis, they were less likely to use condoms with\ntheir _primary_ partner than single gay men were to use condoms with _all_\npartners. We are socialized to believe our relationships create some kind of\nbiological protection when they do not; thus, lots of people are probably\nbeing a lot more cautious in touching and interacting with people outside of\ntheir home than they are about touching the people closest to them in their\nhome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenton has studied Ebola extensively, and she\u2019s been thinking about how people\nawaiting Ebola tests were placed in \u201ctransit centers\u201d in West Africa, \u201cand\nwhile people would be waiting for tests to come back, people who were not sick\nbecame sick.\u201d Because so few people in the U.S. are getting tested, when all\nmembers of a family retreat to their home believing they are well because they\nare asymptomatic, other members of the family might become infected from their\nclose proximity. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be spread,\u201d Benton\n[wrote](https://twitter.com/Ethnography911/status/1240474778202517504), \u201cit\u2019s\ngoing to be through intimate connections.\u201d\n\nAs two college professors, we also discussed how it is a mistake to assume\nsending people home makes them safe in the overall context for their lives.\nHeteronormative thinking presumes that home is the safest place, overplaying\nthe [falsely hyped\nmenace](https://books.google.com/books/about/Risk_and_Sociocultural_Theory.html?id=hyf-\nYWZleFgC&q=%22stranger+danger%22#v=snippet&q=%22stranger%20danger%22&f=false)\nfaced by \u201cstranger danger\u201d and downplaying the reality that the most likely\nplace people face sexual and physical violence is [in their\nhomes](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem). (When I tweeted [about\nthis](https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/1237951432466345984), I was\nrelieved that a reader immediately [tweeted\nback](https://twitter.com/emilytroutman/status/1237950979489902595) about\n[how](https://www.jta.org/2020/03/11/united-states/preparing-for-the-worst-\ncase-scenario-jewish-aid-groups-scramble-amid-the-coronavirus-outbreak) groups\nlike the \u201cJewish Coalition Against Domestic Abuse, which supports victims in\nthe Washington, D.C.-area, announced that it is \u2018safety planning with people\nwho may be quarantined with their abuser.\u2019 The group urged those needing help\nto call its helpline.\u201d) Benton told me she remembers when she\u2019s had students\n\u201cwho needed to go home on break who didn\u2019t want to,\u201d which brought on \u201ca lot\nof suicide ideation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose things aren\u2019t being talked about enough\u2014kids who got kicked out of home\nfor coming out, or who left because they were abused, or because the pressure\nwas too high,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial distancing by way of home detention may work for the public health, but\nmany individuals will pay a price for it. Not all men trying to work who feel\nthey are interrupted by women or children will be as good-humored as the\n[professor in the BBC viral\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY). That [living with guns in\nyour home increases your chance of\ndeath](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death), there has been\na surge in [gun sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-gun-\nbuyers.html), and people will be spending more time at home than ever portends\ndanger. Without figuring out how to get lots of people tested quickly, that\nsacrificial price could mean people\u2019s health. And without figuring out how to\nsupport people in abusive living situations now denied any hours of respite\naway, the sacrifice could be lethal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n###  \u201cPANOPTO\u201d\n\nClassrooms can be fun. You get to play with ideas that the market would\ndismiss as unworthy. When I teach, I make a\n[soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG_WlgjR1olkuGX_yp5Lb-\nQn7iSxs1NsF) of songs thematically to play as students arrive, and then I have\na student lead a conversation about it. It\u2019s a nice way to ground our\nclassroom in a critical practice that is also enjoyable. Yet even in their\nbest state, classrooms are still hierarchies; teachers and students occupy\ndifferent levels of power, and both are subject to institutional racism,\nsexism, and surveillance.\n\nI have a colleague who shows their students one photo each week either of a\nprison, a school, or a hospital, and they ask their students to identify which\none it is. They usually can\u2019t, but there is still humor (if bleak) in the\nshared experience of analyzing such photos together and thinking about the\nphysical space of institutions inside an institution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am grateful financially that my work as a professor will go on in a time so\nmany are losing income. But when it comes to teaching online, I am mindful\nthat, for me and my students, many of the joys of teaching and learning\ntogether simply cannot be replicated through a screen. The electric nature of\nlistening to music, looking at images, or debating ideas depends on social\ncues. But even more worrisome than that, our classrooms will now be under\nheavy surveillance. As University of Iowa professor of sociology and African\nAmerican studies Louise Seamster\n[mused](https://twitter.com/louise_seamster/status/1237734392556146694) on\nTwitter, \u201cJust got an IT email suggesting the use of lecture-recording\nsoftware called Panopto. PANOPTO.\u201d In his essay \u201cPanopticism\u201d from\n[_Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the\nPrison_](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679752552/?tag=slatmaga-20), the\nphilosopher Michel Foucault writes about Jeremy Bentham\u2019s design for a tower\ninside of prisons meant to be staffed by a single guard, \u201cto induce in the\ninmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the\nautomatic functioning of power.\u201d\n\nNot only will classes be online for the foreseeable future; they may be\nrecorded. Universities or private platforms might claim intellectual property\nto a professor\u2019s lectures. Clips of what students or professors say might be\nleaked online, go viral, and be used against them professionally\u2014and fear of\nthis might make students or professors turn the panopticon upon themselves and\nself-censor. This would be a great loss to the often roving space of the\nclassroom to think through ideas in a capacious manner. On recorded video, a\nstudent might not critique (let alone joke about) how much their school looks\nlike a prison if they want to be a teacher someday.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad; disabled students, students with transportation issues, and\nstudents with sick children have long been asking for an ability to attend\nclasses remotely with good reason. But one of my biggest fears is that once\nuniversities, businesses, and governments see that not investing in real\nestate may be cheaper\u2014and that having each worker or student maintain their\nown computers at home is also cheaper\u2014they might make the decision to do away\nwith in-person meetings as much as possible, if not altogether.\n\nPrisons are sites where technologies are first tested on captive populations\nthat are later used in hospitals and schools. For instance, for years, Securus\nTechnology has been installing equipment for video visitations in prisons that\nmandate that the prisons must ban in-person visitation and incarcerated people\ncan only be allowed to talk to their loved ones through [Securus\nscreens](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/09/skype-for-jailed-\nvideo-calls-prisons-replace-in-person-visits). For years, they have been\nending in-person visits under a guise of austerity. According to the [Marshall\nProject](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/17/tracking-prisons-\nresponse-to-coronavirus), prisons in all 50 states have curtailed or entirely\nended visitations because of the coronavirus. My fear is that, as the\ntechnology that allows institutions to facilitate communication with\npotentially fewer capital costs ( _and_ that increases surveillance)\nflourishes in this period, what Naomi Klein calls the [\u201cshock\ndoctrine\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/24/disaster-\ncapitalism-permanent-state-life-americans) will take hold: _If_ this crisis\npasses, school and hospitals will do more work through screens like prisons\nalready do, allow less in-person interaction, and justify these changes for\nreasons of cost and security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if there isn\u2019t mass rebellion to return to in-person contact, the already\nfuzzy distinctions between schools, prisons, and hospitals will disappear\naltogether. But how can we mass mobilize in quarantine?\n\n###  ACT UP\n\nA lot has been made of the coronavirus and the flu of 1918. As a scholar of\nHIV/AIDS, I\u2019ve been thinking about what the AIDS pandemic\u2014which is _not_ in\nthe past and has killed 38 million and counting\u2014can teach us about this\npandemic.\n\nThere are important differences and important similarities with these two\nglobal pandemics. At the viral level, the human immunodeficiency virus, and\nthe novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, are different viruses with _very_\ndifferent modes of transmission. HIV is a relatively inefficient virus that is\ndifficult to contract; it can only be transmitted through certain bodily\nfluids, such as blood, semen, and breast milk, and even then, transmission\nhappens relatively infrequently. (For instance, the [Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention\nestimates](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html) that on\naverage, per 10,000 instances of HIV exposure, transmission will only happen\njust 138 times via receptive anal intercourse, 63 times via injection drug\nuse, and only eight times via receptive vaginal intercourse.) And while we\ndon\u2019t yet know how frequently exposure to COVID-19 will result in\ntransmission, it is clearly _far_ more efficient at transmitting between\nhumans than HIV. We certainly know that the novel coronavirus transmits in\nways HIV does not, such as touch, shared surfaces, respiratory droplets, and\ncasual contact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are real and perceived differences between a respiratory virus like a\ncoronavirus and a retrovirus like HIV. A respiratory virus is something we\nimagine comes into your body (maybe even annually, like influenza) and, if\nyour body survives it, eventually leaves your body; we imagine that we \u201cget\nover it.\u201d Retroviruses like HIV can be kept in check very effectively, but we\nnever imagine that they \u201cleave the body\u201d entirely. HIV and the coronavirus are\nalso very different in that the former epidemic has been located in specific\ncommunities (which differ between different countries), while the latter is\ntransmitting among the general public the world over. Perhaps the most stark\ndifference between the viruses right now is that HIV can be managed in such a\nway that people living with the virus not only [live normal life\nspans](https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-life-expectancy-in-u-s-matches-\ngeneral-population-with-some-differences), but\u2014when properly medicated\u2014their\nviral load gets so undetectably low that they become [unable to transmit the\nvirus to others](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-\nhiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable). Meanwhile, there is no medication to\neffectively curb the coronavirus or its transmissibility, just ways to treat\nsome of its symptoms.\n\nAnd yet, there are a lot of similarities between the two pandemics and\u2014just as\nimportantly\u2014between the politics that leave the same kinds of people most at\nrisk for transmission (and at risk for inadequate post-transmission\ntreatment). People who are homeless, incarcerated, or lacking health insurance\nare particularly vulnerable to both. HIV and the coronavirus are both\nracialized in the U.S. imagination in dangerous ways, the former imagined as\nBlack and the latter imagined as Asian. Both\n[HIV](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/united-states-ends-22-year-hiv-travel-\nban/story?id=9482817) and the coronavirus have been used to justify illogical,\nstigmatizing travel bans. (While keeping people in place can be very helpful\nwith a pandemic as easily transmitted as COVID-19, the Trump administration\nrestricted travel from Europe long after the virus was already widely\ncirculating in the U.S.; early testing would have been far more useful than\nblaming \u201cforeigners\u201d for what had already become a domestic crisis.)\nUntreated, HIV compromises people\u2019s immune systems and the coronavirus hits\npeople hard who already have compromised immune systems. Both viruses have an\nasymptomatic incubation period in which the person living with it might have\nno idea, driving asymptomatic transmission. And, because of ableism in\nAmerica\u2014which imagines individual and national bodies as healthy until sullied\nby a \u201cforeigner\u201d\u2014people living with either virus have been demonized as\ninvaders, as if they have engaged in some kind of moral failing.\n\nThe initial responses to both AIDS and COVID-19 were bungled by inept and\ncallous responses from Republican administrations for related but distinct\nreasons. The Reagan administration\u2019s inaction on AIDS was because of whom it\ninitially affected: homosexual men and people who injected intravenous drugs,\nwho were written off as \u201cfags\u201d and \u201cjunkies\u201d respectively. More recently, the\nTrump administration\u2019s inaction on COVID-19 was largely fueled by Trump\u2019s\nlifelong habit of distancing himself from bad news; however, I think this was\nalso at least partially because of who the commander in chief assumed it would\nhurt most: the sick and infirm. Donald Trump has a history of openly\n[mocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX9reO3QnUA) the disabled, and his\nunhinged musings in early March that \u201cwe have thousands or hundreds of\nthousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and\neven going to work\u201d reveals a common American assumption that people should be\nstrong enough not to fall ill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth the Reagan and Trump responses happened within general frameworks of\nausterity and of individualistic ableism, the latter of which devalues people\nwho are in vulnerable categories because they deviate from the young and\nhealthy presumed norm. If _necropolitics_ is what the post-colonial scholar\nAchille Mbembe described as when \u201cthe ultimate expression of sovereignty\nresides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may\nlive and who must die,\u201d than the early necropolitical responses by Ronald\nReagan\u2019s White House to AIDS and the Trump White House to COVID-19 are\nremarkably similar: They both imagined the populations hit would be\ndisposable.*\n\nCuriously, moments of destigmatizing both viruses lie in a common denominator:\nthe actor Tom Hanks. When he won the Oscar in 1994 for playing a man who died\nof AIDS in the film _Philadelphia_ , he praised two gay men he\u2019d known and\nsaid \u201cmy work, in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of\nheaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a\nthousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight.\u201d As a\nstraight white man, Hanks helped America think more about AIDS. And decades\nlater, when Hanks and wife, Rita Wilson, went public that they had tested\npositively for the coronavirus in Australia, they not only helped destigmatize\nthis new virus but helped sound the alarm in the U.S. that testing wasn\u2019t\nhappening quickly enough. (The downside of Hanks as the face of either virus\nis that it might distort the public\u2019s perception of who might be the most at\nrisk.)\n\nThe coronavirus crisis demands activist interventions. The crisis has led\ngovernments to change [election\ndates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/virus-\nprimary-2020-ohio.html) and to [ramp up\nsurveillance](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/18/digital_surveillance_covid_19_coronavirus/);\nbusinesses [seem](https://twitter.com/DocDre/status/1239991774485123081) to be\ndoing things like reducing workers to zero hours while refusing to formally\nlay them off, so that they can neither qualify for employer insurance nor\nunemployment. Humans need a collective response.\n\nThere is also a lot we can learn by looking at the politics of how activists\nhave responded to HIV to think about how we might address this new virus. In\n1987, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, began meeting in New\nYork City. A model for Occupy Wall Street many years later, the group of\ndirect action activists used direct democracy, even with meetings of hundreds.\nACT UP got in people\u2019s faces to demand government and businesses respond\nfaster and with more urgency to the AIDS crisis. The biggest currency they\nused was their bodies, gathered in mass. They laid down in streets to protest\ninaction, stormed the [New York Stock\nExchange](https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/act-up-demonstration-at-the-new-\nyork-stock-exchange/) and took over the [Food and Drug\nAdministration](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/before-\noccupy-how-aids-activists-seized-control-of-the-fda-in-1988/249302/). In 1992,\nthey even marched to the White House and threw the dead, [cremated\nremains](https://actupny.org/diva/synAshes.html) of people who had died of\nAIDS onto its lawn. But they also used their bodies to transgressively\nmaintain intimacy, such as at the 1987 [kiss-in](https://www.out.com/news-\ncommentary/2010/08/17/st-vincents-remembered) at St. Vincent\u2019s hospital. There\nis a scene in the film [_BPM_](https://www.amazon.com/BPM-Beats-Minute-\nEnglish-Subtitled/dp/B077YRDX8W/?tag=slatmaga-20) __ (about ACT UP Paris) in\nwhich a gay man gives his friend who is dying of AIDS a hand job in the\nhospital that is among the most honest depictions of intimacy I have ever seen\ndepicted in a feature film sex scene\u2014and it captures how diligently gay people\nworked to make sure their sick and despised friends still experienced care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the ACT UP archives, where I\u2019ve seen how many\nmembers were calling for universal health care decades ago; they believed that\ndetangling health insurance from jobs and marriages would result in a kind of\nqueer liberation. Even when they protested AIDS specifically, many members\n[pointed out](https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/1238439286527201280) the\nterrible conditions _all_ people faced in the U.S. health care system. While\nits numbers have waxed and waned over the years, the New York chapter has\ncontinued to meet on Monday nights for more than three decades. It has a\n[robust social media presence](https://twitter.com/actupny), and for the past\nfew years, ACT UP New York has been involved in a particular fight that we in\nthe U.S. should be paying attention to right now. ACT UP has been fighting\nGilead pharmaceuticals for [price-gouging HIV\nmedications](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/728053397/aids-activists-take-on-\nthe-high-price-of-hiv-prevention-pill). Because Gilead is among the medical\ncorporations [closest to\ndeveloping](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/hopes-rise-over-\nexperimental-drugs-effectiveness-against-coronavirus) COVID-19 medication, ACT\nUP could play a significant, well-informed role in pressuring Gilead (and the\npoliticians beholden to pharmaceutical manufacturers) to distribute it freely.\n\nBut, for the first time last week, I went to an actual ACT UP meeting, in\nNYC\u2019s LGBTQ center. A couple dozen people were there\u2014a beautiful mix of races,\nages, and expressions of gender. Some people had been there in the early days;\nsome were there for the first time. On the agenda were what to plan for Harlem\nPride, how to help people find housing, how to pressure the remaining\npresidential candidates on AIDS, and what to do about the coronavirus. The\npassion in the room was palpable, and with such a rich deep history of\nactivism and recent history with Gilead in the present, I could imagine many\nof the people who are suddenly wanting to do something swelling ACT UP\u2019s ranks\nto those of its heyday.\n\nBut here\u2019s the ACT UP conundrum: Despite their strong Twitter presence, their\nhistory and power are embodied in physical bodies taking up physical space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Stephen Helmke, who started coming to ACT UP meetings in 1988, what\nthose of us facing this new crisis can learn from decades of AIDS activism.\n\u201cThe aura of social outcast and the broad public fear and avoidance of\notherness and identification of a vector, and the hate lodged at the\nvector\u2014that was the experience of people with HIV,\u201d he said, reflecting with\nsympathy on prejudice being deflected toward Asians and Asian Americans. He\nalso thought we could get behind universal health care. \u201cThe ACT UP chant that\nhealth care as a right,\u201d he said, which was directed at HIV positive and\nnegative people, \u201cwas that unless you contributed to the public health, then\nyou cannot be free from its maladies. You are going to be at risk of a\npandemic until you secure health care for everyone.\u201d\n\nLike many at the meeting, Helmke is concerned about what COVID-19 means for\npeople living with HIV. In theory, people living with HIV whose medications\nare working aren\u2019t more susceptible than the rest of us; but, many long-term\nsurvivors of HIV/AIDS have \u201creconstituted immunity,\u201d are older, and have other\nconditions that do make them more susceptible\u2014the very people who shouldn\u2019t be\nout in public meeting or protesting right now. (Given that homelessness is a\npredictive factor in who is most at risk for HIV/AIDS and of people who can\u2019t\nself-isolate, it is likely COVID-19 could be devastating to the unhoused.)\n\n\u201cFor a long time our model has been,\u201d ACT UP member Jake Powell told me, \u201cwe\nhave power by being able to physically show up and demand accountability and\nto not be quiet. To be in the room where\u201d decisions are made, and by \u201cstorming\noffices and disrupting space.\u201d But this new virus means, precisely, that such\ntactics are impossible to try to shape the political response to the virus\u2014and\nhow our isolation precludes such physical collective action is a conundrum.\n\nAnd at the moment its history and politics could be so broadly useful, ACT UP\nmeetings have moved online. They\u2019ve now moved to Google Hangouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve watched people struggle to adapt pretty quickly\u2014to stop going to sex\nparties or to start washing hands\u2014I am trying to be gentle. The social\nscientist in me understands that behavior is learned over time and takes time\nto change. Many people are mourning that our ways have to change, and grieving\nthis takes a bit of time.\n\nOne thing we have to grieve is the myth that our way of life is coming back.\nIt\u2019s not. AIDS changed so much in the world, both the obvious and hidden.\nNearly everything changed with AIDS medically, and a lot politically, too,\nfrom the nearly invisible (how blood is screened and how drug trials are\n[happening so rapidly right now](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-\nclinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins)) to the highly visible\nand day-to-day. Like, the use of single-use plastics and sterilized products\nshot way up. Like, your dentist and dental hygienists didn\u2019t wear gloves\nbefore AIDS, and first-responders didn\u2019t treat everyone as if they might have\nHIV.\n\nThere\u2019s power in how, for the first time in history, any human on the planet\ncan instantly communicate with any other and talk about facing the same\nchallenge. This new crisis will change everything. _Everything_. Everything\nabout how we work and socialize, everything about how we make love and make\npolitics. It might very well be a less haptic world, a more screen-centered\nand surveilled world. The world will be rebuilt, and we have a chance to make\nit better\u2014but this will only happen if we can figure out mutual care and mass\nmobilization with tactics that have never been used on such a scale before.\nWe\u2019d do well to listen to leadership from disabled activists who have a lot of\nexperience with political action without needing physical presence. But we\nhave to keep thinking critically. There are no easy answers, and the status\nquo won\u2019t do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter being told she could no longer visit her husband with Alzheimer\u2019s in his\nnursing home\u2014to whom she\u2019s been married for more than a half-century\u2014an\nelderly friend of mine wrote on Facebook of also \u201cmissing my church friends\u201d\nwhen she needs their comfort most and of the \u201cdilemma of social distancing vs.\nsocial isolation.\u201d\n\nThis is the central political and spiritual dilemma of our time.\n\nCorrection, March 21, 2020: This post originally misspelled Achille Mbembe\u2019s\nfirst name.\n\n[ AIDS ](/tag/aids) [ Health ](/tag/health) [ History ](/tag/history) [ LGBTQ\n](/tag/lgbtq) [ Mental Health ](/tag/mental-health) [ Incarceration\n](/tag/incarceration) [ Coronavirus ](/tag/coronavirus)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [Reprints](http://www.slatereprints.com/)\n  * Advertise: [Site](mailto:advertise@slate.com) / [Podcasts](http://mediakit.slate.com/podcast-network)\n  * [Commenting](/commenting)\n  * [Contact](/contact) / [Feedback](mailto:feedback@slate.com)\n  * [Pitch guidelines](/pitch)\n  * [Corrections](/news-and-politics/corrections)\n  * [About us](/about)\n  * [Work with us](/jobs)\n  * [Send us tips](/tips)\n  * [User agreement](/terms)\n  * [Privacy policy](/privacy)\n  * [AdChoices](http://optout.aboutads.info/)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/Slate/) [ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/slate) [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/slate/)\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.  \nAll contents (C) 2020 The Slate Group LLC.

Based on solutions, the market is classified into\nhardware, and software. By deployment models, it includes on-premise and\ncloud. By services, the North America Lecture Capture System includes training\nservices, installation and integration services and professional services.\nBased on end- user market is segmented into Educational Institutes, and\nCorporate. Geographically market is spread by US, and Canada.\n\n**REQUEST FOR FREE SAMPLE\nREPORT:<https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/request-sample/8439>**\n\nLecture capture, also known as lecture recording, is a term being used for a\nwide variety of techniques to maintain artefact of classroom activity and then\ndistribute them to students. Three potential streams are identified of capture\nthat includes the audio of the lecture and class discussions; or the visual\nresources comprising of slides and screen captures; along with video of the\nactual classroom. Audio recordings are the simplest version of lecture\ncapture, and are often paired with the presentation slideshow.\n\nCompanies are working on lecture capture system built with the flexibility of\nhaving to record various combinations of video sources, be it any\nconfiguration, or classrooms of any size. These are made with the ease to meet\ninstitution\u2019s needs starting from small departmental deployments to the larger\ncampus-wide installations. Companies have worked with edu-tech teams, faculty,\nand staff for building a lecture capture system that fades in the background.\nCompanies like Panopto are making devices that automatically recognize any\nconnected cameras and microphones, along with remembering professors\u2019\nrecording settings for making the setup simple. For administrators, companies\nhave made unique automated recording software that enables one to schedule\nrecordings ahead of time that are related to fully-automated lecture capture.\nIt further provides team and users with total control over the entire\nrecording infrastructure that may also come from any web browser.\n\nNorth America is one of the major markets for Lecture Capture Systems where\nU.S. and Canada are the two major regions profiled under this report. US held\nthe largest share for the North America Lecture Capture Systems market due to\nthe growth in technological progression within the educational sector where\nmore number of companies are working to make the educational facilities more\ninteractive and easier to understand.\n\nKey players operated in North America Lecture Capture Systems Market includes\nPanopto, Cisco Systems Inc., Sonic Foundry, Echo360, Tegrity, Accordent\nTechnologies, Creston, Dell, Kaltura, MediaCore, OpenEye, Qumu, Mc-Graw Hill\nEducation, Inc., Telestream, VBrick Systems, Lumens Digital Optics, Inc.,\nPowerCreator Info & Tech Co., Ltd., Teltek Video Research.\n\n**DO INQUIRY BEFORE PURCHASING REPORT\nHERE:<https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/inquiry-before-buying/8439>**\n\nThe Scope of North America Lecture Capture Systems Market:\n\nNorth America Lecture Capture Systems Market by Solution:\n\n\u2022 Hardware  \n\u2022 Software  \nNorth America Lecture Capture Systems Market by Deployment Model:\n\n\u2022 On-premise  \n\u2022 Cloud  \nNorth America Lecture Capture Systems Market by Service:\n\n\u2022 Training services  \n\u2022 Installation and integration services  \n\u2022 Professional services  \nNorth America Lecture Capture Systems Market by End-User:\n\n\u2022 Educational Institutes  \n\u2022 Corporate  \nNorth America Lecture Capture Systems Market by Region:\n\n\u2022 US  \n\u2022 Canada  \nKey Players Operated in North America Lecture Capture Systems Market:\n\n\u2022 Panopto  \n\u2022 Cisco Systems Inc.  \n\u2022 Sonic Foundry  \n\u2022 Echo360  \n\u2022 Tegrity  \n\u2022 Accordent Technologies  \n\u2022 Creston  \n\u2022 Dell  \n\u2022 Kaltura  \n\u2022 MediaCore  \n\u2022 OpenEye  \n\u2022 Qumu  \n\u2022 Mc-Graw Hill Education, Inc.  \n\u2022 Telestream  \n\u2022 VBrick Systems  \n\u2022 Lumens Digital Optics, Inc.  \n\u2022 PowerCreator Info & Tech Co., Ltd.  \n\u2022 Teltek Video Research\n\n**MAJOR TOC OF THE REPORT ******\n\nChapter One: North America Lecture Capture Systems Market Overview\n\nChapter Two: Manufacturers Profiles\n\nChapter Three: Global North America Lecture Capture Systems Market\nCompetition, by Players\n\nChapter Four: Global North America Lecture Capture Systems Market Size by\nRegions\n\nChapter Five: North America North America Lecture Capture Systems Revenue by\nCountries\n\nChapter Six: Europe North America Lecture Capture Systems Revenue by Countries\n\nChapter Seven: Asia-Pacific North America Lecture Capture Systems Revenue by\nCountries\n\nChapter Eight: South America North America Lecture Capture Systems Revenue by\nCountries\n\nChapter Nine: Middle East and Africa Revenue North America Lecture Capture\nSystems by Countries\n\nChapter Ten: Global North America Lecture Capture Systems Market Segment by\nType\n\nChapter Eleven: Global North America Lecture Capture Systems Market Segment by\nApplication\n\nChapter Twelve: Global North America Lecture Capture Systems Market Size\nForecast (2019-2026)\n\n**Browse Full Report with Facts and Figures of North America Lecture Capture\nSystems Market Report at:<https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/market-\nreport/north-america-lecture-capture-systems-market/8439/>**\n\n**About Us:**\n\nMaximize Market Research provides B2B and B2C market research on 20,000 high\ngrowth emerging technologies & opportunities in Chemical, Healthcare,\nPharmaceuticals, Electronics & Communications, Internet of Things, Food and\nBeverages, Aerospace and Defense and other manufacturing sectors.\n\n**Contact info:**\n\nName: Vikas Godage\n\nOrganization: MAXIMIZE MARKET RESEARCH PVT.

News\n\nThis wasn\u2019t how LaShawnDa Pittman expected to give her final exam review: At\nher kitchen table, laptop open, coffee cup at the ready, her 12-year-old\nChihuahua named Espresso by her side.\n\nBut as the first week of the University of Washington\u2019s shift to online\nclasses drew to a close,\n[Pittman](https://aes.washington.edu/people/lashawnda-pittman), an assistant\nprofessor of American Ethnic Studies, was talking with her students over the\nconferencing platform Zoom, first to answer logistical questions about the\nupcoming exam, then to provide a refresher of some of the themes of the\ncourse. For this class, African American Families, that meant revisiting some\nkey historical developments and public policies from the Civil War to the\npost-civil rights era.\n\nNavigating the technology effectively has been a learning opportunity for\neveryone, Pittman said afterward, but the university\u2019s decision to cancel in-\nperson classes for the remainder of winter quarter was the right thing to do\n\u201cfor the health and well-being of everyone on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be as flexible as I can with all of this,\u201d Pittman explained.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety among students. I\u2019m trying to end the quarter in a\npowerful way for students, to try to be as compassionate and make this is as\neasy as possible for them.\u201d\n\nAround the UW, faculty in every department, school and college made a change\nin plans. School of Music instructors conducted lessons over FaceTime. In the\nJackson School of International Studies, guest speakers visited over Zoom. A\ndoctoral defense in the School of Oceanography was livestreamed, with audience\nmembers occupying every second seat. And School of Public Health Dean Hilary\nGodwin has been holding \u201ctown hall\u201d webinars on all things COVID-19.\n\n[![Student at a lectern with a screen behind him and audience members\nscattered around the room.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/03/16170405/online-learning-\nphoto-375x250.jpg)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/03/16170405/online-learning-photo.jpg)\n\nJake Steinberg defends his research to in-person and online audiences in the\nSchool of Oceanography.Olivia Hagan/U. of Washington\n\n[Rick Mohler](http://arch.be.washington.edu/people/rick-mohler/), an associate\nprofessor of architecture, wrapped up his winter-quarter Research Design\nStudio from an empty classroom in Gould Hall. On the wall-mounted monitor, his\nstudents presented, group by group, their proposals to revamp six Seattle\nneighborhoods. At quarter\u2019s end, there was to be a celebratory event \u2014 a panel\ndiscussion with local officials and planning professionals \u2014 but that has been\npostponed indefinitely.\n\nIt\u2019s been a challenge, Mohler said, to translate what is normally a hands-on\nclass, in a room filled with posters of housing prototypes, scale models of\ncity blocks, and the chatter of student groups. Viewing their digital models\non a large-screen monitor \u2014 rather than a student laptop in class \u2014 is a\ndefinite plus, he said. But the shift to an all-online environment means\ncontinual adjustments.\n\n\u201cA potential silver lining in this crisis,\u201d Mohler said, \u201cis that we are being\nrequired to adopt remote conferencing tools we might otherwise ignore.\u201d\n\nStudents have been adapting, too \u2014 concentrating on lectures via Zoom and\nPanopto, \u201cvisiting\u201d instructors in online office hours and submitting\nquestions to discussion boards. None of the technology is completely\nunfamiliar, students say, but the totality of it \u2014 every lecture, every\nassignment, every question, every test \u2014 has taken some getting used to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a big learning curve,\u201d said freshman Hannah Lee as she studied in\nOdegaard Undergraduate Library last week. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been some\nlimitation in not being able to work with other people on whiteboards, or to\nhave them write things out. But Zoom meetings are nice, because we can share\nscreens. My TA was able to pull up her screen and write out what she would\nhave written out on paper for us.\u201d\n\nFreshman Zage Phillips likened the shift to online classes to a public health\nexperiment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that they\u2019re doing this for people who are high-risk, but I think\nthat it\u2019s a good test to see if we can keep it contained,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut\nI think that the results will only show us if it actually worked in the\nfuture.

Photo by Eli\u0161ka Merchant-Dest.\n\n# UMBC professors gear up to go online\n\nBy Johanna Alonso on March 23, 2020\n\nWhen Dr. Mariajose Castellanos first heard that classes would be moving online\nfor the two weeks following spring break due to the current outbreak of\nCOVID-19, her initial reaction was not concern, frustration or anger. It was\nsadness.\n\n\u201cMy favorite part of teaching is being with the students in the trenches,\u201d\nexplains Castellanos, a senior lecturer within the Department of Chemical,\nBiochemical and Environmental Engineering. Though she used to lecture, she has\nrecently worked to restructure her classes to be more team-, problem- and\nproject-based, assigning her students pre-class work so that they can spend\nclass time working through problems together.\n\nNow, like many other professors at the University of Maryland, Baltimore\nCounty and around the country, she will have to move those discussions to an\nonline video-call format; she plans to use Blackboard Collaborate for full-\nclass meetings and Webex for meetings with her class\u2019s five-person project\nteams.\n\nBlackboard Collaborate and Webex, as well as Google Hangouts, are the three\nsynchronous learning tools that are compatible with UMBC logins, according to\nJohn Fritz, Associate Vice President for Instructional Technology. Synchronous\nlearning is a term that refers to professors teaching in real time, while\nasynchronous learning refers to students watching pre-recording videos and\nlectures. Panopto, which Fritz describes as \u201ca lecture-capture tool, or a\nscreen-capture tool,\u201d is an asynchronous teaching tool that is provided\nthrough Blackboard.\n\nDespite the many resources at their disposal, some professors are unsure if\nthey will be able to replicate the feeling of in-class discussions in an\nonline space. For Dr. Lindsay DiCuirci, who is teaching a seminar in the\nEnglish department called Dangerous Reading in the Early U.S., what is\ndiscussed in class each day is based largely on \u201cwhere [the students] land in\nthe various texts we\u2019ve read for that week \u2026 We might cover a lot, or we might\nend up sitting with one poem.\u201d\n\nOver a video conference, that free-flowing approach may not result in\nproductive conversation the same way it does in the classroom. Without the\nability to \u201cread the room,\u201d she worries that she will not be able to tell as\neasily when the students find something confusing and need her to spend time\nexplaining it, for example.\n\nHer solution is one that most students would appreciate: She is cutting down\non the number of readings in order to stage more focused and productive\ndiscussions.\n\n\u201cYou go with what\u2019s essential,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were gonna cover an entire,\nyou know, fifty Walt Whitman poems. But the meat of what I really want people\nto zero in on are these ten.\u201d\n\nLuckily, for both DiCuirci and Castellanos, there are not any significant\nchallenges associated with moving the content of the course online. DiCuirci,\nwho has a background in the digital humanities, is already anticipating using\nblogging tools, like WordPress, and digital archives, like The Walt Whitman\nArchive, to create assignments that are specially suited to online learning.\n\nAlthough for many, the image that comes to mind when picturing an engineering\ncourse involves tinkering with parts and building models, Castellanos\u2019s class,\nProcess Engineering Economics and Design II, will also not be difficult to\ntransfer online. Because the materials required for chemical engineering\ndesign projects are prohibitively expensive, the curriculum of the class\nalready involves using online simulations.\n\nWhat may be harder to transfer are the student presentations \u2014 which, in\nCastellanos\u2019s course, are delivered approximately every other week. In\nresponse to a survey Castellanos sent to all of the students within her\ndepartment, a few students in her course requested that she allow them to give\ntheir presentations live, rather than submitting pre-recorded video. According\nto Castellanos, this is because they do not want to miss out on the chance to\ngain experience with presenting and improving their communication skills.\n\nAnother concern is how professors will give their exams. Test questions that\nare not straight-forward multiple choice or essay questions, such as math\nproblems in which the students\u2019 work is considered in how the question is\ngraded, will be difficult to transfer online. And without a proctor, some\nprofessors worry that they will not be able to prevent academic dishonesty.\n\nTo those professors, Fritz recommends the Respondus LockDown Browser, which\nprevents students from using other functions on their computers while taking\nthe test and records them from their webcam so that professors can tell if\nstudents are looking at notes.\n\nCastellanos\u2019s concerns go beyond which resources to use, however; she worries\nthat some students will not have the time and space to take her exams in the\nfirst place. \u201cHow are they going to take an exam for two hours if they\u2019re a\nmother or a father whose kids are home from school?\u201d she asks, referring to\nthe fact that Maryland public schools are currently closed until at least\nMarch 30.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do exams like we used to do exams,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to come up\nwith something else.\u201d\n\n\n\n**The quest for academic continuity**\n\nThough DiCuirci and Castellanos have developed plans for the coming weeks, not\nevery professor has the ability to dive so deeply into online learning on such\nshort notice. Those professors are looking to the university, to their\ndepartments and to their colleagues for guidance.\n\nOne way professors are assisting one another? By acting as Academic Continuity\nAmbassadors.\n\nThe twenty Academic Continuity Ambassadors previously served as Blackboard\nUltra Ambassadors \u2014 faculty members whom the Division of Information\nTechnology deemed proficient enough in using Blackboard to help guide other\nfaculty as a newer version of the site, Blackboard Ultra, is rolled out. When\nthe news broke that courses would be moving online, the Ultra Ambassadors were\nasked to \u201cexpand their scope a little bit\u201d and help their colleagues with the\ntransition, according to Fritz.\n\nSince then, the ambassadors have spent their days fielding and trying to help\nsolve their colleague\u2019s technical or pedagogical problems.\n\nAmong their ranks are Castellanos, as well as psychology professor Dr. Eileen\nO\u2019Brien, who knows the ins and outs of online learning from having taught\nIntroduction to Psychology as an online course in the past.\n\nDifferent faculty have required different levels of help with the transition\nto distance learning: \u201cI think it runs the range from people who haven\u2019t even\nused Blackboard before\u201d to people who are already fairly comfortable teaching\nfrom home, O\u2019Brien says. According to Fritz, 82 percent of courses and 87\npercent of professors use Blackboard to some extent.\n\nSo far, much of O\u2019Brien\u2019s consulting has involved teaching her colleagues\nabout the different platforms that are available and helping them decide which\nplatforms will work best for them. She advises professors to go with whichever\ntool they are most comfortable with, explaining that, \u201cWhen you have to turn\nso many things around in a short period of time, you go with what you know.\u201d\n\nCastellanos, similarly, has fielded questions regarding whether a synchronous\nor asynchronous approach is optimal; she sees a combination of the two methods\nas most effective. One of her top pieces of advice is to make sure online\nlectures are digestible for the students. \u201cDon\u2019t tape 45-minutes of you\ntalking,\u201d she warns. \u201cChunk it out into littler videos: seven minutes, seven\nminutes, seven minutes.\u201d\n\nFritz attributes the success of the Academic Continuity Ambassador initiative\nto the culture of UMBC, which he says promotes collaboration between\nprofessors. \u201cFaculty learn best from other faculty, and I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d\nhe explains, stating that the Department of Information Technology probably\nwould have been overwhelmed over the past week if they had not had the\nambassadors\u2019 assistance.\n\nThat being said, DoIT is providing several types of direct support as well. In\nthe three days preceding spring break, DoIT staff members were on hand to\nanswer questions and solve technology-related problems for faculty. The\ndepartment also delivered a webinar on that Wednesday, which 120 faculty\nmembers attended virtually, that explained tools like Panopto and Webex.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DoIT plans to continue with digital drop-in sessions,\nwhich are opportunities for professors to consult with the DoIT staff. Those\nwill take place from 9 a.m. until noon on weekdays, and will be followed by\nsessions focused on specific topics in the afternoon. [The schedule for these\nsessions can be found on the DoIT\nwebsite](https://doit.umbc.edu/itnm/training/).\n\nAdditionally, Fritz encourages professors to visit DoIT\u2019s [academic continuity\nwebpage](https://doit.umbc.edu/itnm/academic-continuity/), which includes a\nwealth of resources.\n\n\n\n**\u201cThe concerns are, rightfully, the big ones.\u201d**\n\nNow that this period of distance learning has been extended from a mere two\nweeks to the rest of the spring semester, UMBC students are having to contend\nwith bigger changes than just the transition to online classes. Some are\nhaving to figure out where they will live, if not in their on-campus housing;\nothers are trying to find work after [Governor Larry Hogan ordered the closure\nof Maryland bars and restaurants](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-\nmd-restaurant-shutdown-20200317-ibk6xjiclfay7hde4bt26nw2jq-story.html).\n\nFortunately for those students, professors like DiCuirci are aware of these\nchallenges, and are determined not to inundate students with extra stress.\n\n\u201cThe transition to home, whatever home might mean for some people, might mean\na really radical, really disruptive change to their life,\u201d DiCuirci says. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to surge ahead as if that disruption isn\u2019t really there or doesn\u2019t\nreally matter.\u201d\n\nWhile she wants her class to be able to continue learning about and\nappreciating great literature, she knows that most students have other\npriorities at this time.\n\n\u201c[Students\u2019] number one concern \u2014 and this is not a slam at students at all \u2014\nis not, \u2018how will we have robust discussions anymore?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe\nconcerns are, rightfully, the big

In addition, May graduates will have the option to\nparticipate in the December 2020 commencement ceremonies, according to\nAppalachian State.\n\nChancellor Sheri Everts stated in a message to students that University of\nNorth Carolina system President Bill Roper announced at the March 20 Board of\nGovernors meeting that spring graduation ceremonies will be disrupted.\nCampuses were able to make independent decisions about how to move forward\nwith commencement ceremonies.\n\n\u201cThere are many details to work out, but please know my leadership team and I\nare committed to preserving, to the greatest extent possible, the essence of\nthe celebrations and milestones of the final weeks of the spring semester \u2014\nincluding commencement,\u201d Everts said in her message. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat that will look like, but we are working hard on virtual solutions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Everts, university administrators are in regular contact with\ncounterparts across the UNC system and in the system office.\n\n\u201cWe are following system guidance together and applying it to our campuses in\nthe ways that make the most sense for each of our situations,\u201d Everts said in\nher message.\n\nEverts also expressed gratitude to the university community for adjusting to\n\u201crapidly developing, unprecedented challenges.\u201d She added that faculty and\nstaff were working long hours to transition to alternative course delivery for\nstudents.\n\n\u201cFor many of us, the \u2018Appalachian Experience\u2019 is firmly grounded in a sense of\nplace,\u201d Everts\u2019 message said. \u201cWe are all saddened by our empty classrooms and\nsunny days with no hammocks and slacklines, and while we are fortunate to have\ntechnology to keep us connected, Zoom meetings and Panopto just aren\u2019t the\nsame.\u201d\n\nAccording to the university, out of the 5,674 students who lived on campus,\nonly 160 of them met the criteria to remain in the residence halls. Other\nstudents picked up essentials \u2014 or more \u2014 this week and returned to their\nhomes. Everts said the residence halls had been thoroughly cleaned, and only\nthe aforementioned approved residents will be allowed in the buildings.\n\nAccording to a March 20 report from Roper, the UNC system tried encouraging\nstudents to stay away from campuses. But 30 to 40 percent of UNC system\nstudents remained on campus in response to this \u201copt-out approach.\u201d The system\nshifted to a policy of requiring students to seek permission to stay on\ncampus, and Roper said he system hoped to see the number of those who remain\nwill be closer to 10 percent on each campus.\n\nApp State will be operating with reduced staffing for facilities, meaning\nemployees are operating under limited capacities. The academic classroom and\noffice buildings, Plemmons Student Union and university libraries are keeping\ntheir core services available. However, some buildings will be key- or card-\naccess only.

Something that will result in\nhigh voter turnout,\u201d said Zack Church, apartments resident director currently\noverseeing SGA.\n\nCampaign speeches have been uploaded through Panopto, a video platform used by\nTrevecca, as the chapel that would typically host them never occurred due to\nthe transition of moving students off campus. A link to access the video\nspeeches was sent in an email on Friday, and students are able to view them\nprior to voting. On Monday, a link will be sent to students to access the\nvoting once it is open.\n\nBlackboard was originally considered as an option for online remote voting as\nit was used in the past for elections in 2017, but during those elections\nvoter turnout was lower and for this year someone would need to be trained on\nhow to use the system, so Mara Hogan, online learning specialist, suggested\nSurveyMonkey.\n\n\u201cWe were looking at the timeline, and we don\u2019t have enough time to train\npeople since we only have three weeks left\u2026 the system would be complicated to\nlearn in one week,\u201d said Stephany Ordonez, ASB vice president. \u201cMaybe in the\nfuture they could implement that.\u201d\n\nAfter voting is complete, they\u2019ll evaluate whether the integrity of the votes\nwas preserved and decide then whether or not to shift back to voting via\nBlackboard, said Church.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was really hesitant to do SurveyMonkey because I didn\u2019t know how\nreliable it was\u2026 but then Zack found the option of filtering who votes and we\nwere able to input all the emails from the students at Trevecca,\u201d said\nOrdonez. \u201cHe was able to figure out how to see who opens the link via email or\nwho opens it from somewhere else.\u201d\n\nClass council elections are still occurring, and will have an application sent\nout on Monday, but a date for the elections has yet to be determined.\n\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b828255ae9252881486dc1deb51ae057?s=100&d=blank&r=pg)\n\n[trevechoesonline](https://trevechoesonline.com/author/tnujournos/)\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Twitter](https://trevechoesonline.com/2020/04/06/student-government-elections-will-be-held-online/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Facebook](https://trevechoesonline.com/2020/04/06/student-government-elections-will-be-held-online/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * \n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategories: [Campus News](https://trevechoesonline.com/category/campus-news/)\n\n# Post navigation\n\n[As Supreme Court ruling approaches, tensions are high for DACA\nstudents](https://trevechoesonline.com/2020/04/01/as-supreme-court-ruling-\napproaches-tensions-are-high-for-daca-students/)\n\n[Nashville churches use livestreams to keep congregations\nconnected](https://trevechoesonline.com/2020/04/07/nashville-churches-use-\nlivestreams-to-keep-congregations-connected/)\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/2020/04/06/student-government-elections-\nwill-be-held-online/#respond)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Facilities including Rod Library and the Wellness Recreation\nCenter will be open during and after spring break. The Student Health Clinic\nand the Counseling Center, although closed the week of spring break, will open\nagain March 23.\n\nResidence halls and dining options will remain open.\n\nClasses are expected to remain online through at least Friday, April 3.\n\nEducators are planning to use online tools such as Zoom, TurnItIn and Panopto\nto connect with students and continue coursework. Faculty have the option to\nteach from home or from their office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some creative options,\u201d Hager said. \u201cOne (music teacher) is using\na video communication tool so they can still have their lessons and hear the\ntechnique and hear the music.\u201d\n\nLaptops can be checked out for those who don\u2019t have one.\n\nUniversity advisers will see students in the office or online.\n\nThe university also launched a new webpage,\n[prepare.uni.edu](http://prepare.uni.edu), to keep staff, students and\nfamilies up to date with news and cancellations.\n\nThe Study Abroad Center canceled all study abroad summer programs for 2020,\nand the Board of Regents extended the 30-day international travel ban by seven\ndays until conditions improve. The travel ban applies to university-sponsored\ninternational travel for students, faculty and staff.\n\nStudents with any health-related concerns or questions should contact the UNI\nStudent Health Clinic at 273-2009, option 1, or visit the [clinic\nwebsite](https://health.uni.edu).\n\nPHOTOS: UNI Dance Marathon 2020\n\nClose\n\n1 of 8\n\n__\n\n![UNI Dance

As an educator,\nyou're used to feeling confident when you walk into the classroom: You know\nwhat you're going to do, what's going to happen,\" says Rebecca Rotundo,\nassistant director of learning and design for the Center for Educational\nInnovation.\n\n\"And now, we're shifting to a situation where we don't always know what's\ngoing to happen. Will the technology work? How will students respond?\" Rotundo\nsays. \"It's important to remember that students also are feeling this way, and\nmost of them will have patience and understanding if things don't work the\nfirst time. It's important, also, to remember that students are also in\nuncharted territory, and faculty will also need to show patience.\"\n\nOnline teaching resources and a link to register for an emergency online\ncourse-building session are available on the [Center of Educational\nInnovation's website](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubcei.html).\n\nSessions take place through the Zoom video conferencing platform. The classes\nare group classes, with sessions offered every day.\n\nFaculty, lecturers and teaching assistants who have specific questions or\nwould like one-on-one support can also [contact the\ncenter](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubcei/about-us/contact-us.html) to set up a\nconsultation.\n\nIn recent days, the center has been guiding teachers through a variety of\nquestions relating to distance learning.\n\n[ ![Tim Cauller \\(left\\) works with Christine Kroll, Assistant Vice Provost\nand Director of the Center for Educational Innovation.\n](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-articles/stories/2020/03/cei-\nonline-\nteaching/_jcr_content/par/image_219268282.img.680.auto.jpg/1584707246948.jpg)\n](/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-articles/stories/2020/03/cei-\nonline-\nteaching/_jcr_content/par/image_219268282.img.original.png/1584707246948.png)\n\nTim Cauller (left), program director for English As A Second Language\ninstruction, works last week with Christine Kroll, assistant vice provost and\ndirector of the Center for Educational Innovation.

You will find your way,\" she\nsays. \"I've talked to so many people over the past few days. It might be\ndifficult, it might take a week or two, but I think in a few weeks, we'll get\nover the initial hump and figure this out.\"\n\nThe work faculty members are putting into transitioning their classes online,\nwith the support of the Center for Educational Innovation, exemplifies the\nexcellence that make UB one of the best public research universities in the\nnation, says A. Scott Weber, UB provost and executive vice president for\nacademic affairs.\n\n\"In this extraordinary moment, I am encouraged and deeply grateful that our\nfaculty, as well as our staff and students, are rising to the challenge and\nworking hard to ensure that we continue to provide our students with an\nexceptional education.

Photograph: Robert Kneschke/Alamy Stock\nPhoto/Alamy\n\nBefore this month\u2019s strikes over low pay and pensions cuts, staff were warned\nto pause their lecture recordings while they told students that they would be\ntaking part. The University and College Union (UCU), which organised the\nstrike, worried that university management would search recordings to identify\nwho would be engaging in industrial action, and introduce measures to lessen\nits impact.\n\nThe union had good reason to be concerned: during last year\u2019s strikes, the\nhead of Edinburgh University\u2019s law school [emailed staff asking them to upload\nrecorded versions of their\nlectures](https://www.scotsman.com/education/edinburgh-university-lecture-\nrecordings-used-against-strikes-1-4701523) so students wouldn\u2019t miss out on\nteaching.\n\nThe UCU and the National Union of Students were furious. Soon after, Edinburgh\nUniversity\u2019s policy on lecture recordings changed: it became the first UK\nuniversity to explicitly ban the rerunning of lecture recordings during\nindustrial action.\n\n## The rise of EduTube: how social media influencers are shaping universities\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/02/the-rise-of-edutube-how-\nsocial-media-influencers-are-shaping-universities)\n\n\u201cIt was a very short-sighted move on behalf of the department that did it, but\nthe response has been to create the most progressive and comprehensive policy\nin the UK around lecture recordings,\u201d says Emily Nordmann, a University of\nGlasgow academic who has studied lecture recording technology.\n\nIt\u2019s a time of change for universities, but policies are struggling to keep up\nwith rising student numbers and the growing infiltration of technology in\nlecture halls. At many institutions, teaching is recorded through a system\ncalled Panopto (or ReCap) and uploaded to digital learning environments like\nBlackboard, so it\u2019s accessible in students\u2019 own time. According to Panopto\u2019s\nown figures, more than 1,000 institutions worldwide use it to record more than\n100 hours of video every month. The old idea of \u201cthe sage on the stage\u201d that\nhas pervaded higher education for thousands of years is disappearing. And some\npeople are worried.\n\n[Academics](https://www.theguardian.com/education/academics) fear that on-\ndemand recordings, which some have called the \u201cNetflixisation of academia\u201d,\nwill affect attendance. They also worry about less obvious consequences: it\ncould be used to bust strikes, it could be a watching eye monitoring their\nperformance, and eventually it could replace them. But do they have genuine\nreason to be concerned?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the data proves them wrong,\u201d says Nordmann. But she disagrees\nwith the gloomier predictions: \u201cIt\u2019s a tool in the same way a textbook is for\na student.\u201d\n\nA [survey](https://www.nusu.co.uk/news/article/yourvoice/NUSUs-ReCap-Report-\nReleased/) by Newcastle University\u2019s students\u2019 union found that around three-\nquarters of students say they very rarely use recordings as a reason not to\nattend lectures \u2013 apart from disabled students or those living far away who\nstruggle to afford the daily commute. \u201cLecture recording is very beneficial\nfor vulnerable groups of students,\u201d explains Pablo Charro de la Fuente,\neducation officer at Newcastle University. And when [one in five\nstudents](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/where-from) are\nfrom outside the UK, recordings can also be a good way to revisit material\nthey didn\u2019t fully understand.\n\nDespite being used last year in Edinburgh, the fear of lecture recordings\nbeing used to bust strikes is overstated, reckons Nordmann. UCU general\nsecretary Jo Grady describes the rerunning of old lectures as \u201cineffectual\ntactics\u201d which have \u201cmerely hardened strikers\u2019 resolve and angered students\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s also a longstanding worry that reruns could become the norm, even\noutside of strike periods. \u201cI\u2019ve heard individual staff members express\nconcern they\u2019ll be replaced by a videotape. When the ReCap policy is updated,\nwe\u2019ve always relayed that that\u2019s not the purpose of it,\u201d says Joe Barton,\nrepresentation and research coordinator at Newcastle University\u2019s students\u2019\nunion.\n\nSince the intellectual property for the content of lecture recordings\ngenerally belongs to the performer, it\u2019s unlikely that recordings will replace\nlecturers. This hasn\u2019t quelled any anxieties among staff: Jisc, which provides\ntech support and advice to universities, has been compelled to [produce\nguidance](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/recording-lectures-legal-\nconsiderations) for fearful lecturers.\n\nThe problem is that each university has different policies when it comes to\nlecture recording. A\n[survey](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324943672_Lecture_capture_in_higher_education_time_to_learn_from_the_learners)\nof 35 UK institutions by Nordmann and colleagues found that 11 had staff opt\nin to recording, 19 required staff to opt out, and four had different\napproaches depending on individual schools.\n\nBut the evidence is that students don\u2019t want a teacherless classroom. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink that interaction with the lecturer can be replaced,\u201d says De la Fuente.\n\u201c[It] wouldn\u2019t be welcomed from the student body.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community side of lecture attendance is the most important thing,\u201d adds\nNordmann. \u201cStudents can probably learn the same amount from the video but it\u2019s\nactually being there in the room with the person that makes the difference.\u201d\n\nThere are also concerns that the creeping advent of the red light and camera\nor microphone near the lectern is a way to spy on staff members and monitor\nhow they teach. In reality, almost every university policy Nordmann has read\nexplicitly states that recordings can\u2019t be used for the purposes of\nperformance management.\n\nNevertheless, some academics think that recording lectures has changed the way\nthey teach \u2013 whether it makes them less spontaneous and more likely to stick\nto the script, or wary of cracking jokes in case it comes out wrong and is\ncaptured on camera.\n\nAs the demographics of those teaching change, concerns around recording will\nlikely disappear. \u201cI see a difference between people who have been lecturing\nfor 20 or 30 years and people who are newer to it, or who are perhaps more\nused to having every moment of their lives filmed and recorded,\u201d says\nNordmann. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always been recorded, I don\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, most universities allow lecturers to opt out of recording some\nlectures, or to pause recordings at sensitive moments \u2013 though often they\ndon\u2019t know they can. \u201cStudents understand,\u201d says Nordmann. \u201cIf you treat them\nlike adults and explain why some lectures are recorded and some aren\u2019t, they\ngenerally are fine with it.\u201d\n\n## Join us: sign up for the Guardian Universities newsletter\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/oct/05/sign-up-for-guardian-\nuniversities-newsletter)\n\nRegardless of some lecturers\u2019 reservations, the tide is changing.

have lecture recording technology in their lecture rooms. \u201cAs video has\nbecome commonplace in education, academics are using it like any other\ntechnology: they experiment with it, learn what it does well, and find their\nown applications for it in the classroom,\u201d says Peter Ingle, general manager\nfor Panopto in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nNordmann describes the shift as similar to how PowerPoint transformed\npresentations. \u201cThey\u2019ve now become ubiquitous,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the\ncomparison we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nTopics\n\n  * [

He could see delivering\nlectures with Zoom or Panopto, splitting up small discussion groups with Zoom,\nand using more remote and multimedia resources to teach the course. The UW\nrecently procured a [$200,000\nlicense](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_b84ed55a-5f55-11ea-9330-ef702786cff2.html)\nto make Zoom Pro video conferencing free for all faculty and students.\n\nSimilarly, James Long, an associate professor of political science, said he\u2019s\nconcerned about how the lack of in-person interaction will affect the format\nof his class, which is highly discussion-based. Most of his readings and class\nassignments are not compatible with an online setting and would require a\nmassive course overhaul.\n\n#### More COVID-19 Coverage\n\n[ _UW Medicine offering drive-thru coronavirus testing to\nemployees_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_dff5db18-6337-11ea-8c48-e75bad64c604.html)\n\n[_What the novel coronavirus outbreak means for unsheltered young\npeople_](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_e9cf2f9e-626b-11ea-8d22-73d398cb706b.html)\n\n_[How the move to online classes amid coronavirus is fundamentally altering\ncourses](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_81e2e072-61aa-11ea-\naefa-93afeba4f941.html)_\n\n_[Pacific Northwest's blood supply at risk of collapse amid coronavirus\nfears](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_9e78d83c-61ae-11ea-\nab8c-cbf7052e4fb1.html)_\n\n_[How the end of in-person classes due to novel coronavirus affects on-campus\nemployees](http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_1058e150-6014-11ea-8893-c7f5667fa50b.html)_\n\nPresident Ana Mari Cauce said in a March 6 press conference that the\nuniversity is working through scenarios of what it would be like to do\n\"distance education\" for a week or two after the break, but didn\u2019t elaborate\non what that might look like.\n\n\u201cInstructors are being strongly encouraged to develop academic and business\ncontinuity plans that consider longer term disruptions, such as a late start\nor broad online instruction for Spring Quarter, in case they are needed,\u201d\nBalta said in an email.\n\nHistory professor Margaret O\u2019Mara also said she\u2019s revising assignments to\n\u201ctake advantage of the online environment\u201d for her graduate-level seminar,\nwhile noting some of the equity issues that arise with a fully tech-based\nclass.\n\n\u201cOne important consideration will be recognizing that everyone\u2019s tech\ncapacities are different at home depending on where \u2018home\u2019 is,\u201d she said in an\nemail. \u201cUW dorms with campus bandwidth, or homes and apartments that don\u2019t\nhave the same wifi capacity.

An online quarter might result in these labs being canceled,\nwhich can affect future academic goals for many students who intend on\napplying to medical school or jobs in research fields, both of which require\nlab experience.\n\nKyle Thayer, who teaches one of the introductory informatics classes, says he\nis creating a tentative plan for moving the class online in a way that will\nstill maintain engagement.\n\n[ ![UW Medicine offering drive-thru coronavirus testing to\nemployees](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n](/news/article_dff5db18-6337-11ea-8c48-e75bad64c604.html)\n\n###  [ UW Medicine offering drive-thru coronavirus testing to\nemployees](/news/article_dff5db18-6337-11ea-8c48-e75bad64c604.html)\n\nUW Medicine staff, faculty, and employees can get tested for the novel\ncoronavirus without even leaving their cars.\n\nAnother concern for many professors is what the quarter will look like if\nother public schools and childcare services in the city were to close because\nCOVID-19 continues to spread.\n\n\u201cMy biggest worry is that if and when our daycare gets closed, how will I both\nkeep my young children entertained and get my school work done,\u201d Thayer said\nin an email.\n\nResearchers expect the number of cases locally to continue to rise, with one\nUW researcher suggesting there could be hundreds more with COVID-19 in\nWashington already based on a genetic analysis.\n\n\u201cThere's no way to know for sure, of course, but I doubt the rate of new\ninfections drops precipitously in the next three weeks,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI'd love\nto be proven wrong.\u201d\n\n _Reach News Editor Jake Goldstein-Street and Science Editor Ash Shah\nat[news@dailyuw.com](mailto:news@dailyuw.com).

Will you be able to\ndirect a show using Zoom? Are class discussions going to look the same?\n\nAfter the frenzy of packing, waving goodbyes and booking flights subsided\nearlier this month, questions related to how classes would continue remotely\nbegan to emerge, especially for those taking classes in different time zones\nor in places with compromised internet connections.\n\nOn March 10, President Laurie Patton announced that classes would [resume\nremotely](https://middleburycampus.com/48879/news/coronavirus/) after spring\nbreak. In her email, Patton pointed to the Office of Digital Learning &\nInquiry (DLINQ) as an important resource for faculty as the college\ntransitions to remote instructions. DLINQ is a subset of the provost\u2019s office,\nstaffed by 10 members in Vermont and at the Middlebury Institute of\nInternational Studies at Monterey. Its mission is to look for ways to advance\nincorporating the digital in the advancement of student lives and education \u2014\nprevious projects include the annual Digital Detox.\n\nAmy Collier, associate provost for digital learning, told The Campus that the\noffice has worked with around 100 faculty members across the college and in\nMonterey, which has also\n[suspended](https://middleburycampus.com/48883/news/developing-middlebury-\nsuspends-programs-in-monterey-abroad/) in-person classes, since the\nannouncement. Many faculty members on the Vermont campus took advantage of\ndrop-in sessions, and around 30 faculty members scheduled individual meetings\nwith the office.\n\n\u201cA typical session with a faculty member involves talking through the types of\nactivities they usually do in class, the learning outcomes for those\nactivities \u2014 what they expect students will know or be able to do as an\noutcome of the activities,\u201d Collier said. \u201cThen, we talk about how we might\nmeet those learning outcomes using the available technology tools.\u201d\n\nBeyond this type of support, the office also launched a series of workshops on\ntopics including \u201c[Screencasting 101 with\nPanopto](https://dlinq.middcreate.net/event/screencasting-101-with-\npanopto-2/),\u201d \u201c[Using Zoom for Synchronous Learning\nActivities](https://dlinq.middcreate.net/event/using-zoom-for-synchronous-\nlearning-activities-2/),\u201d and \u201c[Managing Quizzes & Assessments in\nCanvas](https://dlinq.middcreate.net/event/managing-quizzes-assessments-in-\ncanvas/).\u201d\n\nDuring these meetings, the office actively encouraged faculty to plan\nasynchronous interactions with students to get around hurdles such as time\ndifferences. On the other hand, College Provost Jeff Cason and Dean of Faculty\nSujata Moorti also emphasized the importance of \u201cscheduling synchronous course\nmeetings\" in a March 16\n[email](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/announcements/previous-\nannouncements/academics-going-forward) to faculty.\n\nDLINQ has encouraged faculty to use a variety of online tools, including the\n[now-ubiquitous](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/style/zoom-parties-\ncoronavirus-memes.html) conferencing platform Zoom for live video calls and\nPanopto for posted lectures.\n\n![](https://middleburycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/thumbnail_Screen-\nShot-2020-03-26-at-12.23.27-AM-475x255.png)\n\nCOURTESY PHOTO  \nThe Wilson Media Lab, where the DLINQ office is located.\n\nStarting March 30, Tao You \u201922.5, a math major, might take classes from\nBeijing, which is 12 hours ahead of EDT.

The only\ncompromise for STEM [classes] is that we can\u2019t ask questions during lectures,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cBut for discussion-heavy humanities and social sciences,\nasynchronous teaching will be a different story \u2014 I think the quality will be\nseverely curtailed.\u201d\n\nTo get a better sense of how ready students feel about remote instruction,\nCason and Moorti sent out an email to all students on March 23 asking students\nto provide feedback on the challenges they might face, including issues\nrelated to internet accessibility.\n\nStudents at the institute have been learning remotely since March 17. Michael\nCarboy MIIS \u201920, who studies environmental policy and corporate\nsustainability, is in the institute\u2019s master\u2019s program.\n\nCarboy is not a fan of remote learning, and said his \u201cNortheast Asia Nuclear\nWeapons Policy\u201d class is affected most significantly by the remote changes. On\nan average, in-person day, the class debates declassified government documents\nin detail. Now, the professor mostly lectures, and students can comment via\nthe chat bar.\n\n\u201cLack of in-class dialogue with other students, garbled online audio,\nlimitations on being able to have multiple screens displaying different things\nand the general inability to get up, walk to the whiteboard, and mark up\nthings are all major detriments to the currently necessary on-line\narrangements,\u201d he said.\n\n**From MAC to MacBook**\n\nAlex Draper, professor of theatre and the department chair, said that the\nTheatre Department is brainstorming ideas for moving forward with colleagues\naround the country. The department is investigating how much synchronous\nteaching can occur without overwhelming people\u2019s schedules and is trying to\nfigure out how much professors can alter the arcs of their classes, Draper\nsaid.\n\nDespite the inherent difficulties, Draper is optimistic. \u201cThere is room for\ncreative experimentation and who knows what unforeseen gifts will come of\nthat,\u201d he said.\n\nSpecifically speaking, for studio classes such as \u201cActing I: Beginning\nActing,\u201d Draper said he is trying to \u201cto recalibrate course content in a way\nthat folds in practices that are already happening remotely (auditions, self-\ntaping, online rehearsing, one-on-one monologue coaching, character\nresearch).\u201d\n\n\"\n\nThere is room for creative experimentation and who knows what unforeseen gifts\nwill come of that.\"\n\n-- Alex Draper\n\nFor classes that culminate in a show, such as this spring\u2019s planned\nperformance of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d the department hopes to continue rehearsals\nand is looking for ways to present to the public virtually.\n\n\u201cSince we can\u2019t block a show virtually, I think it makes sense to focus on\nwhat we can do,\u201d said Assistant Stage Manager Devon Hunt \u201923. \u201cWe should work\non other related things to fill in the gaps and still make this a complete\nclass as best as we can in these given circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe transition to online learning will also affect STEM students who take\nclasses with a lab component. Lucia Snyderman \u201923, a student in Chemistry 103,\nis worried about how the lab portion of class will transfer online. She and\nmany other lab students are still waiting on further clarification about what\nto expect.\n\n\u201cI do not think that virtual labs will create the same learning experience as\nconducting in-person labs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is it\u2019s just not the same as\nholding the real tools in your hand and setting up the experiment and\nobserving the reaction first-hand.\u201d\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Chemistry 104 student Amaya David \u201923 said, \u201cthe lab\ncomponent of chemistry really helps with the application of different\nprocesses so I\u2019m afraid that it will be more difficult for me to retain\ninformation without a tangible lab [component].\u201d\n\n\"\n\nI am worried about classes that are moving to more recorded lectures since\nthen there\u2019s less interaction with other students and the professor.\"\n\n-- Tim Hua\n\nGlen Ernstrom, professor of biology & neuroscience, teaches \u201cCell Biology and\nGenetics,\u201d a class with three hours of lab each week this term. He told The\nCampus he is aware of how remote learning may affect some of his students, and\nis constantly reconsidering how to best teach the class without adding stress\nfor his students. He remains hopeful that he and his students will be able to\nfind the best way as they move forward, even though mistakes might be\ninevitable.\n\nThe transition has also made some first-year Febs wonder how they might take\nfull advantage of their First Year Seminars. The program\u2019s goal is to \u201cuse\nintensive engagement between professors and students to facilitate the\ntransition from high school to college,\u201d according to the program\u2019s\n[website](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/fys). It is currently unclear\nhow that \u201cintensive engagement\u201d might be replicated remotely.\n\n\u201cI am worried about classes that are moving to more recorded lectures since\nthen there\u2019s less interaction with other students and the professor,\u201d said Tim\nHua \u201923.5, whose First Year Seminar is called \u201cCities in Crisis.\u201d\n\nThe First Year Seminar department met on March 20 to discuss options going\nforward, but could not be reached for comment by press time.\n\n[Share on\nFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmiddleburycampus.com%2F49275%2Farts-\nacademics%2Fbracing-for-seismic-impact-of-remote-learning-faculty-turn-to-\ndlinq%2F \"Share on Facebook\")[Share on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bracing for seismic impact of\nremote learning, faculty turn to\nDLINQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmiddleburycampus.com%2F%3Fp%3D49275 \"Tweet This\nStory\")[Print](//middleburycampus.com/49275/arts-academics/bracing-for-\nseismic-impact-of-remote-learning-faculty-turn-to-dlinq//?print=true)\n\n  * [DLINQ](https://middleburycampus.com/tag/dlinq/)\n  * [remote learning](https://middleburycampus.com/tag/remote-learning/)\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__This comment form is under antispam protection\n\nWe encourage community engagement and discourse on comment threads.

This has been difficult, especially for my\nhusband who is more \u201ctheoretical\u201d than me in his pedagogic approach when he\ntries to explain things to our six-year-old the same way he would to an\n18-year-old undergraduate.\n\nHe also threw a few six-year-old temper-tantrums himself on his first day of\nprimary school teaching, cursing the amount of homework given to our daughter.\nHowever, he has since eased into his new teaching role well and has even\nmastered Joe Wicks\u2019 workout at 9am every morning.\n\nIn our day jobs as academics, there have been a few teething mishaps in the\nmove to online teaching. Last Thursday I had a live collaborative lecture\nsession but just as I was starting, the whole Blackboard system went down so\nhalf the students were stranded online, half couldn\u2019t join the session and I\nwas locked out. Thankfully we have a fast response online digital education\nteam that know me well by now and who were on hand to help.\n\nIn the end, I had to record the lecture to put up later once the systems were\nup again.\n\nI still prefer live-session teaching, where students can message chat and you\ncan still check students\u2019 understanding of what you are delivering. My husband\nmeanwhile still likes gesticulating at the screen recording of lectures\nthrough Panopto, with no students behind it to question his newfound\ntechnophilic abilities.\n\nWhile we both ease into our own ways of teaching online, students have been\nextremely understanding of the changes that they are having to deal with. They\nhave shown maturity, flexibility, adaptability and determination to continue\nin their studies. In fact, after the last reflection, we had some lovely\nstudent emails assuring us both that our digital failings were understandable,\nand they sympathised with our position as an academic couple with more than\none teaching job.\n\nWhile students have shown their resilience in this new reality, so too have\nour colleagues. There is a shared feeling that we are all in this together and\nour colleagues have shown how supportive and adaptable they can be at such\nshort notice. We have been trying to help each other out with best practice\nand lessons learnt during this time of unprecedented change.\n\n* * *\n\n[**Want to write for _THE_? Click for more information**](/write-times-higher-\neducation)\n\n* * *\n\nThat being said, we still try to maintain an air of professionalism with our\ncolleagues, which can be challenging with two small children in the house. For\nour whole school staff meeting on Wednesday this week we got the girls settled\nwith snacks, toys and their favourite children\u2019s programmes, just to ensure we\ncould squeeze at least an hour out of the meeting. We got through the first\nhour of the video conference call without incident when there was a knock at\nthe door and then our two-year-old proclaimed, \u201cI poopooed my pants!\u201d \u2013\nluckily our microphones were muted.\n\nPotty training, you will have gathered, has been a little hit and miss\n(literally).\n\nI thought I could nip out and deal with my child, but this all happened just\nbefore my item on the agenda required me to speak to the group. So with two-\nyear-old legs akimbo, my husband and I tag-teamed bum wiping duties.\n\nA lot has also gone well. First and foremost, we are all fit, healthy and\nhappy. We have got to the end of the formal teaching of our modules so from\nnext week things get a little easier as we aren\u2019t under pressure to deliver\nteaching. It will just be marking assignments \u2013 which we are used to doing\nremotely anyway.\n\nThis will give us more flexibility to devote time to our children \u2013 which is\nperfect because our six-year-old\u2019s primary school will be officially on Easter\nholidays and we still have to find new ways of entertaining our children.\n\nBut we are looking forward to this new family adventure. The social distancing\nthat has profoundly impacted our family and professional lives has,\nironically, brought us all closer together.\n\n**Theresa Mercer and Andrew Kythreotis are senior lecturers in the school of\ngeography at the[University of\nLincoln](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-\nrankings/university-lincoln).**\n\nRead more about\n\nRead more about:\n\n[Coronavirus](/policy/coronavirus)\n\nRead more\n\n### [We\u2019re an academic couple juggling lecturing from home and childcare\n](/blog/were-academic-couple-juggling-lecturing-home-and-childcare)\n\n## Please [login](/the_user/login/nojs) or [register](/multistep-\nregister/ajax/welcome) to read this article.\n\n### Register to continue\n\n**Get a month's unlimited access to THE content online.** Just register and\ncomplete your career summary.\n\nRegistration is free and only takes a moment.

arts\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/wp.stolaf.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/KutulasJudy1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1)\n\n_This post is part of a blog series, \u2018[Adventures in the New\nHumanities](https://wp.stolaf.edu/news?post_tag=adventures-in-the-new-\nhumanities),\u2019 by Judy Kutulas, the Boldt Family Distinguished Teaching Chair\nin the Humanities._\n\nI can't be the only academic wide awake at 3 a.m., worrying about\ntransitioning to distance learning. Humanists, I suspect, have it easy\nrelative to, say, those who need to figure out nursing classes or chemistry\nlabs or rehearsals, although I do like the idea of the St. Olaf Choir singing\ntogether \u2014 apart \u2014 on Google Meet.\n\nI can offer no useful advice on teaching unfamiliar disciplines at a distance.\nNor would I dare to offer any thoughts on the technology of distancing beyond\n\"Talk to the experts.\" My husband and I did an hour-long two-on-one with St.\nOlaf's amazing Instructional Technologist for Digital Media Ezra Plemons and\nwhile I am sure we will forget the details of all he taught us about Google\nChats and Panopto, I am unafraid to tackle some technology \u2014 and I am\nconfident that when I run into problems, there are people to help me solve it.\nWhere I have been centering my 3 a.m. awakeness is on this question: How can I\ntransition the humanness of my classes to distance learning?\n\n> Where I have been centering my 3 a.m. awakeness is on this question: How can\n> I transition the humanness of my classes to distance learning?\n\nThe largest course I took at Berkeley had 700 students in it. The prof used a\nmicrophone and stood on a stage. Occasionally, in this pre-PowerPoint era,\nthere were old-fashioned slides or a short film. Many students didn\u2019t attend\nclass on a regular basis because they bought the lecture notes that summarized\neach day\u2019s lecture. There were no papers, just exams graded by teaching\nassistants. A lot of my friends took this class during different terms and we\njust passed around the books and notes. One term, the instructor died\nunexpectedly and another stepped in and delivered more or less the same\ncontent, probably learning just as many student names in the process as the\nold prof knew \u2014 which is to say, none. I can easily imagine this class going\nonline and there being the same amount of engagement online as off.\n\nTo be fair to Berkeley, I feel I should add that my smallest class at Berkeley\nhad 11 people in it and was taught by a renowned historian of Germany who went\nout of his way to get to know each of us, read drafts of our research papers,\nand really made us think about the elements of our discipline. We had deep\nconversations, each week led by a different class member. Transitioning this\nclass to distance learning would be considerably more difficult and what would\nbe lost would be that human interaction at the center, the prof getting us\nexcited and engaged about the subject.\n\nMy small Berkeley class was the essence of the liberal arts; my large Berkeley\nclass was its opposite. What I love about teaching at Olaf is doing what my\nBerkeley seminar professor did: creating a class as a community. Most days, I\nlike to think that what happens in the classroom results in more shared\nunderstanding of a topic than anyone walked in the door with. Except now, we\ncan\u2019t walk in the door.\n\n> Most days, I like to think that what happens in the classroom results in\n> more shared understanding of a topic than anyone walked in the door with.\n> Except now, we can\u2019t walk in the door.\n\nSo I've been asking myself: What are the crucial elements that will make\ntemporary distance learning consistent with a St. Olaf education and a\npositive experience, one where students don't fall by the wayside or give in\nto isolation, worry, and frustration?\n\nAt this point I want to pause and acknowledge that there will be cases where\nstudents might end up slipping by the wayside from our classes because their\nimmediate realities are too dire. When such situations arise, I intend to\nimmediately put aside all professorial thoughts and react as a fellow human\nbeing. I know you\u2019ll all do the same. But for now I want to think about the\nnon-emergency parts of this emergency, how to teach Olaf-style from a\ndistance, how to bring our best selves to our virtual classrooms.\n\nStudies show that distance learning can be a retention nightmare. An [EdTalk\nby Dr. Rebecca\nGlazier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhNUrlxDqqA&feature=youtu.be) that\nSt. Olaf Professor of English and Director of Center for Innovation in the\nLiberal Arts (CILA) Mary Titus circulated last week talked about retention.\nThe good news for us is that partially online courses have the best retention\nrates. Since we\u2019ve already all logged half the semester together, we fall into\nthat category. That means we have already established rapport and delivered\npersonalized attention to our students, which Dr. Glazier suggests are crucial\nto successful distance learning. Now we just need to maintain it.\n\nAs students began to scatter and then we were asked not to teach on campus,\nthe first thing I realized that I missed were the before-class interactions.\nI'm one of those annoying profs hovering outside your classroom door as you\nfinish up your class, eager to get inside, ostensibly to set up my technology,\nbut actually because I enjoy the informal chats with the others who show up.\nAlready I miss conversations with Jazmin about what she's brought for\nbreakfast from the Cage, comparing California stories with Carol, and talking\nto Luke about primary season. In a lecture hall of 700 with a mic-ed up prof\non a stage, such conversations don't happen, but for us they serve as a vital\ntime to gauge the status of our students. Are they tired? Confused?\nPreoccupied about room draw? Until a few weeks ago, most were talking about\nspring break and now their lives, like ours, have been upended.\n\nGranted, right now I can probably guess the mood of my classes even at a\ndistance, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t imagine ways of creating a little\nbefore-class informality, even asynchronously. I was thinking about posing\nquestions that invite a bit of self-reflection about students\u2019 current\ncircumstances, like asking them about how they decide what to wear for social\ndistancing or foods they are craving \u2014 trivial things that can, but don\u2019t have\nto, lead anywhere beyond a little shared consciousness. The point is to create\na virtual world not about the class directly, but about the community of the\nclass. Also, I want to know what Jazmin eats for breakfast now that she\u2019s at\nhome.\n\nI accidentally hit on another tool I\u2019m going to use to make my distance\nclasses meaningful, something I\u2019d call Olaf-izing. During the moment when the\nfirst people were departing campus, I reimagined a class that was supposed to\nbe about early-1960s student activism to accommodate students who were leaving\nas well as those who were still around. I turned my class loose on the\ndigitized early-1960s St. Olaf yearbooks and asked students to sleuth out\nchange and continuity on the Hill. I asked them to assess such things as what\nseemed to be important to the community (their answers: sports, religion, and\nmusic), what they noticed about gender and race (lots of activities designed\nto pair up men and women, only occasional students of color but signs, based\non visitors, performance, and some extracurriculars, of attempts at\ndiversity), and if they saw any signs of the beginning of change (more\ninformality, more individuality, beards and folk singers).\n\nSome of my class did the project collaboratively in class and those who\ncouldn\u2019t come to class did it on their own. For 55 minutes my students were\nrowdy and engaged, shouting out observations and sharing finds. It was a great\nmoment. I just finished reading the on-your-own worksheets and more than one\ncame with a note attached that read, \u201cThis was fun!\u201d\n\nDigitized yearbooks have just become a thread in my class. My students will be\nrevisiting yearbooks in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and, yes, PDA, they\u2019ll be\nlooking for you. I have found a way to create continuity, build skills, and\nhelp keep a group of first-year students bonded to the college and one\nanother.\n\n> Digitized yearbooks have just become a thread in my class.

I have found a way to create continuity, build\n> skills, and help keep a group of first-year students bonded to the college\n> and one another.\n\nConsider this page from the 1962 _Viking_ :\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/wp.stolaf.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/BoldtBlogYearbook.jpg?resize=509%2C737&ssl=1)\n\nEngaging, is it not?\n\nGranted, not all classes can make use of the specifically Olaf digitized\nresources, but there are lessons for humanists here, the same truth that I\nunderstand explains the popularity of Harry Potter, _Game of Thrones_ , _the\nBachelor_ , and _Star Wars:_ immersion into a new, fully-realized world.\nImmersion engages us. It\u2019s escapism, but, over time and with study, we come to\nsee patterns and understand conventions, the social rules and norms. We become\nexperts at those worlds and we like to talk to other experts about them. So\nmuch of the humanities plunges us into these fully-realized worlds, whether\nthey be fictional, historical, philosophical, or rooted in another culture.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep immersion as a concept in my head as I redesign my classes,\nadding exercises that take students into sources that let them explore those\nworlds, turning them into active learners, and making sure they have\nopportunities to talk to one another about them. Yes, I will still have to\npost some mini-lectures and PowerPoints, but I want my students immersed in\nsome worlds of the past.\n\nAs it turns out, immersion into worlds of the past has been an implicit part\nof my classes all along. Following our transition, one class will be immersed\nin Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s famous novel about American soldiers in Vietnam, _The Things\nThey Carried,_ and the other will be reading _Cheap Amusements_ by Kathy\nPeiss, which is subtitled _Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century\nNew York_. Until this moment, I never thought of either one as an immersive\nexperience into history rather than a text. Now, though, I\u2019m finding this\nrealization a very reassuring connection between the classes I\u2019m letting go of\nand the ones I\u2019m getting ready to teach.\n\nMy role model has become my high school physics teacher, Mr. MacRae. Anybody\nwho knows me might be a little surprised to discover I loved high school\nphysics and briefly entertained majoring in it until I realized what I\nactually loved was less physics than Mr. MacRae\u2019s teaching style. He gave us\nchallenges and sent us out to solve them, which, having logged a lot of _Big\nBang Theory_ episodes now, I realize is probably the way experimental physics\nworks, designing experiments to answer challenges or questions. Problem-\nsolving, I believe, ought to pair well with immersion into sources because its\nearly questions, at least in my field, are what sources will I use and how\nwill I read the data? Applied critical thinking. It\u2019s exactly what my class\ndid with the yearbooks: use their familiarity with a type of source and then\nread them from a different cultural perspective. The last question on my\nyearbook worksheet read \"What surprised you the most about these yearbooks?\"\nand the answers ranged from \u201chow much was familiar\u201d to \u201chow different the\nworld was then,\u201d because the answer always is, both familiar and different. We\nwalk that line now, between familiar and different.\n\nWhen I think about walking the line between familiarity and difference, I\nrealize that my classes need my essential Kutulas-ness for continuity and I\nneed to find ways of converting that essence to changed circumstances. I want\nmy strengths and my quirks to carry through to my students, to reassure them\nand throw them no curveballs at a stressful time for us all. So, professor,\nknow thyself. I know my students expect a lot of pop cultural content (I\nalready sent them lists of relevant feature films they might watch over\nbreak), they have learned to tolerate my propensity for \u201cweird assignments\u201d\nand my family stories, and they know I\u2019m likely to include a deep dose of\ncollege history moving forward. Indeed, on that latter point, my U.S. women\u2019s\nhistory class just completed posters on aspects of college history relevant\nfor Women\u2019s History Month. We were going to display them in the Crossroads,\nbut couldn\u2019t, so I\u2019m working on a virtual display to share. They are the\noutcome of the summer sprint I wrote about last fall. Stay tuned.\n\n> When I think about walking the line between familiarity and difference, I\n> realize that my classes need my essential Kutulas-ness for continuity and I\n> need to find ways of converting that essence to changed circumstances.

There is the\nprep work that comes before stepping into a classroom, whether it\u2019s doing the\nreading for the day, preparing some images or finding maps or imagining a\ncollaborative exercise. There is the fixed time in the classroom two or three\ntimes a week, along with weekly office hours \u2014 showtime, so to speak. Then\nthere is the time devoted to evaluation, assessment, and feedback, aka\ngrading. And, speaking of walking, I suppose there is also the mulling-over\ntime, those free-form thinking moments when I am doing something else and have\na brainstorm about something classroom-related.\n\nAs we step into our new phase, there is going to be much less classroom in the\nsense that we have known it because some will be synchronous and some won\u2019t.\nThe traditional categories of prep and class and even class and feedback are\ngoing to blur. This is going to be hard for us. It is going to be even harder\nfor students. Some of that is distance, some of that is newness, some of that\nis because we are preoccupied by a lot of other weighty things. We should all\ncut ourselves some slack. I was once a virtual guest on a mom-centric radio\nprogram and voiced the opinion that it was OK to be a good-enough mom rather\nthan supermom. The hosts\u2019 shocked silence was palpable and I was never invited\nback, but right now it is OK to be a good-enough professor and we should\nadjust our expectations of our students as well.\n\nTo me the more crucial variable is that we preserve the essence of community,\ncollaboration, and the liberal arts. Like Rosie the Riveter, we can do it.\n\n_![](https://i2.wp.com/wp.stolaf.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/KutulasJudyCrop1200x900.jpg?resize=400%2C300&ssl=1)Judy\nKutulas is a professor of history at St. Olaf College, where she teaches in\nthe History Department and the American Studies program, along with American\nConversations.

It'll be a weird semester, but\nwe'll get through it together.\"\n\nThat attitude of understanding and collaboration has already paid dividends,\nas professors examine best practices for online instruction and students\nconsider new habits for learning, all the while considering the unique\nchallenges that everybody is facing.\n\nAll of this is being done while working around distractions at home and\ndealing with fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The professors have been absolutely amazing with accommodating the students,\"\nsaid Jonah Finkel '20\\. \"All of my professors have expressed that the No. 1\npriority to them is our health and well-being.\"\n\nThe Studio for Teaching & Learning, W&M Libraries and Information Technology\nhave worked in concert to help ease the transition for faculty and students in\na very small window of time.\n\n\"The amount of innovation going on in such a short period of time is amazing,\"\nsaid John Swaddle, chair of the biology department. \"Hats off to the Studio\nfor Teaching & Learning Innovation and to IT for taking a whole bunch of\nfaculty who weren't necessarily using as much technology to being able to\nteach remotely and online. And then the faculty themselves have really been\nreimagining all of their classes, which is truly amazing.\"\n\n###### **Video conferencing eases transition**\n\nThe rise in use of online video conferencing interface Zoom has helped\nfacilitate better communication.\n\nJeremy Pope, associate professor of history and faculty affiliate in classical\nstudies, uses Zoom for his seminar course, and for his lecture course he has\nalternated between Zoom for short discussions and another program, Panopto,\nthat makes it easier for him to share PowerPoint presentations.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me to discover that it was easier to transition my\nseminar course online than it was for my lecture course,\" Pope said. \"Small-\ngroup discussions work reasonably well in Zoom.\"\n\nCharlie Foster, W&M's director of student veteran engagement, is using Zoom\n[to conduct twice-weekly office\nhours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBaVH2J15k&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR0XBHw372k-G9xUcpcgXju53msjNyOGRzktfneBOOvRp7zIiv9k5JyOIXk).\nHe also is using Zoom to schedule one-on-one sessions with students.\n\nFaculty members like Pope and Foster are finding ways to be flexible while\nalso periodically connecting with students via Zoom or other video platforms.\n\n\"I've been really lucky to have very understanding professors who know that\nthis transition is difficult and who are adaptive with the ways that we learn\nonline,\" said Student Assembly President Kelsey Vita '20\\. \"I'm in a class\nwhere we have both synchronous class on Zoom, and we have the lessons we sort\nof do on our own, and we come back together as a class, and that's really been\nwonderful to have that space and also that togetherness.\"\n\nAdaptability has been the key to this transition for William & Mary faculty\nand students.\n\n\"Faculty and instructors have been amazingly responsive and focused on\ncreating the best learning experience possible for their students,\" said Mark\nHofer, director of the Studio for Teaching & Learning Innovation. \"They are\nconsidering options, weighing students' potential challenges and limitations\nin learning remotely and trying to find approaches that fit the content and\ngoals for their courses.\"\n\n###### **Studio helps faculty adapt**\n\n[The Studio for Teaching & Learning\nInnovation](https://www.wm.edu/offices/stli/) has offered an assortment of\nresources to help faculty members throughout the transition to remote teaching\nand learning, from daily webinars, drop-in sessions and new tutorials. Faculty\nmembers are able to ask questions in real time while facilitators walk through\nsoftware, and STLI team members and library representatives are available for\nindividual support.\n\nSince classes resumed March 23, the STLI has provided daily updates and\nresources, such as new tutorials and guides to help instructors. The STLI also\nhas a group called the \"Keep Teaching Team\" dedicated to fielding questions\nand responding to issues faculty may be experiencing.\n\n\"The grace and fortitude with which the faculty are approaching this\ntransition is amazing,\" said Katalin Wargo, instructional design manager at\nthe STLI. \"I speak to faculty daily who are striving to learn as much as they\ncan about ways to adapt their instruction for remote learning. They are not\nbacking away from this challenge.\"\n\nThe STLI is working with various W&M departments, including the libraries and\nInformation Technology, that are dedicated to exploring innovative ideas that\nsupport faculty during this remote learning initiative.\n\nBy working together, the university has become more aware of the needs for\nboth faculty and students alike.\n\n\"The best part of this transition is seeing our faculty and staff work\ntogether in support of this new reality,\" said Dean of University Libraries\nCarrie L. Cooper. \"I'm especially proud and honored to be working alongside\ntalented colleagues in IT and the Studio for Teaching & Learning Innovation.\nWe've been preparing for this for several years, though we didn't know it\nuntil recently.\"\n\nWilliam & Mary is also developing low-tech options and strategies for\ninstruction and learning.\n\n\"Hosting a real time Zoom lecture is a great way to keep students engaged, but\nthe instructor needs to make that same content available to students with poor\nconnectivity,\" said Mike Blum, program manager at the STLI. \"We can help with\nthose things as well.\"\n\n###### **Libraries provide abundant resources**\n\n[The libraries](https://libraries.wm.edu/) are unable to distribute hard copy\nmaterials during this time of social distancing, but they are able to remotely\nconnect students and faculty with numerous online databases and resources.\n\nThe online programs offered by the STLI include IT and the Library co-\neducators; these programs are evidence of the collaboration and preferred mode\nto work across organizational boundaries to support teaching and learning.\n\nCooper said the libraries spend 90 percent of their budgets on electronic\ncontent, including online books and subscriptions to databases. Those\nresources have expanded exponentially during this time, as many textbook\npublishers have made their entire catalogs of online books available free on a\ntrial basis.\n\nThe libraries have also signed up for trial subscriptions to 10 new databases,\nsuch as the Harvard Business Review's Press Collection and Academic Video\nOnline, which has more than 60,000 titles of videos in all disciplines.\n\n\"The whole world is rallying to help,\" Cooper said. \"Our job has shifted to\nmaking sure that all those resources that are now unleashed are visible to our\npatrons and to our community.\"\n\nNot only are the libraries remotely filling requests by the W&M community,\nthey're also loaning materials to others in higher education throughout the\ncountry.\n\n\"Librarians have always been skilled at matching people with the information\nthey need,\" Cooper said. \"The goal is the same, but the work looks different.\nCOVID-19 has pushed our local collections to center stage, and librarians are\nusing their super searching skills to find open educational resources and new\nsubscription content to meet the needs of our community. Library staff are key\npartners in this new mode of working and supporting teaching and learning.\"\n\n  * [Home](../../../index.php)\n  * [News & Media](../../index.php)\n  * [More

Morgan](https://news-prod.wcu.edu/author/mwmorganwcu-edu/) __March 21,\n2020\n\n[![](https://news-prod.wcu.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/OnlineTeachingCOVID19.jpg)](https://news-\nprod.wcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OnlineTeachingCOVID19.jpg)\n\nWCU associate professor Enrique Gomez gives an impromptu session for\ncolleagues on how to record lectures online.\n\nOne of the many enjoyments Western Carolina University faculty members receive\nfrom teaching is the relationships and interactions they have with students.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the things they will miss most now that the university is\nswitching to online classes beginning Monday, March 23, and likely remaining\nfor the remainder of the spring semester because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nFaculty Senate chair Enrique Gomez said the news of switching to online\nteaching hit some faculty members hard.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of faculty, our face-to-face interactions with our students are a\nvery important part of our instruction and how we see ourselves as\nprofessional educators,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIf you have done online learning you are\nkind of used to this idea. But some faculty are being asked to teach in a\nmodality that they\u2019ve never even considered before, which came as a shock. One\ncolleague shared with me that she cried for an hour after the email had been\nsent out from the chancellor.\u201d\n\nOnline teaching has become a new reality for faculty members and is something\nwhich they have spent the last week preparing for. The Coulter Faculty Commons\nhas played an instrumental role in providing faculty members with the\nnecessary knowledge and tools to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nLed by director Eli Collins-Brown, the CFC provided numerous virtual workshops\nfor faculty members throughout the week, as well as fielding questions through\nits help desk. The workshops covered such things as how to use Zoom and\nBlackboard Collaboration, which is a webinar feature within Blackboard.\n\n\u201cWe are all on board from our homes,\u201d Collins-Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting on\nemail waiting for requests to come in. It\u2019s been slow so far. My suspicion is\nfaculty members are just trying to get their head wrapped around this new\nreality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the CFC\u2019s efforts, Gomez and other faculty members have been\nproactive in helping prepare their colleagues. Gomez held an impromptu\ntraining session on how to use Panopto, a platform used to record lectures.\n\n\u201cThose faculty members who have had some experience with online learning have\nreally stepped up to the plate in terms of sharing information with their\ncolleagues on the mechanics of how to run a course online, sharing resources,\u201d\nGomez said. \u201cSomething else that\u2019s happening, discipline by discipline, is\ninformal networks have grown around social media that are sharing a tremendous\namount of information and best practices to go online.\u201d\n\nOne concern Gomez has noticed is the steep learning curve for some faculty\nmembers regarding technologies like Panopto, Zoom and Blackboard\nCollaborative. In addition, there are some faculty members who are looking to\ndo lectures live through Zoom at the same time their face-to-face classes were\noriginally scheduled.\n\nCollins-Brown is strongly urging faculty not to do so because students who\nhave returned to their homes will have different times of availability because\nof other responsibilities such as taking care of siblings or other family\nmembers, or competing with others in the household for broadband access at\nthat time.\n\n\u201cThat is not best practice,\u201d Collins-Brown said. \u201cWe are encouraging faculty\nto do a mixed type of facilitation, to put as much content and self-paced\nactivities, tests and quizzes, all on Blackboard and only reserve the\nsynchronous webinars through Collaborate or Zoom for things like office hours\nor tutorial sessions.\n\n\u201cIf they tried to teach synchronously, that\u2019s not going to be a satisfactory\nexperience for them as an instructor, and definitely not for students who are\nin a much different situation. If they\u2019re trying to access Blackboard from a\ncell phone with three bars or two bars, that\u2019s not going to be a good\nexperience for them at all.\u201d\n\nGomez said he calculated that during the 2018-19 academic year at WCU,\nstudents downloaded upwards of 28,000 hours of video content. He then\ncalculated what it would be like if WCU provided only lectures online for an\nentire semester to about 12,000 students, that they would have to download\nroughly 1.5 million hours of video streaming content. \u201cThat tells you the\nmagnitude of the job that\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is still undetermined what will happen with programs like nursing where\nclinicals are a part of their accreditation agreement. Gomez, an associate\nprofessor, said in the Department of Chemistry and Physics there is a level of\ncontent already online of labs that can be simulated so students can carry out\nexperiments on their own. He also said that some chemistry courses with labs\nhave decided to have a recorded video and have students answer questions about\nthe process.\n\nThe key to getting through this new normal is patience, understanding and\nadaptability, Gomez said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive experiment that we are running right now,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cI\nthink that we are hearing a call to be caring and compassionate, understanding\nand adaptable to students\u2019 needs, as well as our own, and our colleagues. The\ncall has been to have flexibility and to stay away from rigidity, stay away\nfrom things that are needless in terms of making the content and the teaching\navailable to students.\n\n\u201cThe thing is at this moment is we do not know the full scope of what\nstudents\u2019 needs are going to be. Essentially, we are flying blindly at this\npoint. That\u2019s where the appeal to flexibility and understanding will be. I am\nwilling to adjust my teaching methods and make adjustments as they need me to,\nand to ease up on deadlines and just being caring and understanding and\nsupportive.\u201d\n\nAs for those faculty members still needing help, they can call the help desk\nat 828-227-7487, email [**ithelp@wcu.edu**](mailto:ithelp@wcu.edu) or visit\nthe website at [**https://www.wcu.edu/learn/faculty/coulter-faculty-\ncommons/index.aspx**](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/faculty/coulter-faculty-\ncommons/index.aspx) **.**\n\n**** \u201cThe CFC is fully onboard and available as long as we need to be,\u201d\nCollins-Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re working full-time; we\u2019re just all at home. We\u2019re\ngoing to be available for faculty throughout the rest of the semester.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare On\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n### Latest

Since each student learns differently, this\ncould present some challenges, educators say.\n\nAuburn University\u2019s Parent and Family Association held a Facebook chat\nWednesday evening to make all students aware of how they can best transition\nto remote learning. It also provided a chance for parents to ask a wide range\nof questions about how Auburn plans to handle its operations in the next\nseveral months.\n\n **The online challenge**\n\nRemote instruction began for Auburn University on Monday, after the spring\nbreak, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. It will continue until the end\nof classes.\n\nLady Cox, assistant vice president for student engagement, and Torey Palmer,\nprogram administrator for the Auburn University Parent and Family Association,\ntook questions from parents on the Facebook Live chat.\n\nProfessors are teaching classes in different ways during this time, and\nclasses can be held synchronously or asynchronously, Palmer said.\n\n\u201cSynchronous delivery, which means everybody\u2019s logging in at the same time,\nand it\u2019s like a lecture and you\u2019re all in person but you\u2019re social distancing,\npotentially across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOther professors are choosing to upload a lecture and allow students to watch\nit at their leisure, which is asynchronous learning, he said.\n\nCox said the Biggio Center and the Office of Information and Technology are\nalso providing resources for students on the different apps and forms of\ntechnology on their websites.\n\nSome schools and colleges within the university sent messages to students\nearly on about how to best deal with working remotely.\n\nThe Harbert College of Business shared a Facebook post Monday with\ncommunication and technology advice.\n\nStudents will be using technology such as Canvas, Zoom, Panopto and Virtual\nLab during this time, and the college provided numbers and emails for students\nto reach out to with questions (phone: 334-844-2963; email:\n[cobtech@auburn.edu](mailto:cobtech@auburn.edu)).\n\nThe College of Liberal Arts created a step-by-step guide on Instagram with\ninstructions for students. The guide can be found in the college\u2019s Instagram\nstory highlight: Apps 4 Class.\n\nThe highlight shared instructions for downloading Duo, Zoom, Panopto, Canvas\nand Box. A second story highlight was dedicated to tips for online learning.\n\n **Liberal arts**\n\nThe College of Liberal Arts also shared a tweet Wednesday afternoon offering\ntech support.\n\n\"(Auburn Office of Information Technology) is now offering a Zoom room to help\ntroubleshoot any problems you may have with tech for class,\" the tweet said.\n\"The room is open from 8:30-4:30 and all you have to do is go to the\n<http://aub.ie/sdhelp> link to get connected.\"\n\nStudents who experience difficulties should screenshot their problems and\nimmediately contact their professors, Palmer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that you document that,\u201d Cox said, \u201cand send it as soon as\nthat\u2019s happening. So if that\u2019s happening, if it\u2019s a situation where the\nprofessor streams the class real time, the student needs to send the email\nright then so that the professor has it and it\u2019s documented that that\u2019s what\u2019s\nhappening.\u201d\n\nAny students who don\u2019t have access to technology, like a laptop, should\ncontact the Biggio Center (biggio1@auburn.edu), Palmer said.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I also know \u2026 the bookstore is going to be sending out an email\nto faculty and staff to do a survey of their students\u2019 technology needs,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n **Student difficulties**\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s been doing fine academically so far, but now he feels like he\u2019s\nstruggling in this new format,\u201d said a parent. \u201cWhat can I do to help him?\u201d\n\nPalmer said the office has received this question a lot.\n\n\u201cThis is new for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everyone learns in the same way. As\nwe\u2019re working with students in a situation where they\u2019re not understanding\ncontent, in many ways this is very similar to if they had been in the\nclassroom and they had suddenly run into a roadblock with their understanding\nof material.\u201d\n\nPalmer recommended students contact their professors for help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning as well, those of us that are creating content and putting it\nonline too, and so just be as patient as you can,\u201d Cox said.\n\nThe university\u2019s academic support office also has begun to help students\nremotely, Palmer said.\n\n\u201cThey are providing a lot of their standard services now online through the\nZoom platform as well,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir website (aub.ie/academicsupport) has\nbeen updated to show how to get in touch with each of their big three\nprograms: study partners, supplemental instruction and academic coaching.\u201d\n\n **Time management**\n\nSome students may have difficulty with time management, Palmer added,\nespecially with the asynchronous classes.\n\n\u201cMany of your students have probably developed a routine that hopefully has\nbeen kind of working for them through fall semester and now spring and\nsuddenly we\u2019re in an environment where a faculty member might have recorded\ntheir lecture and they\u2019re saying you can watch it any time on this day, just\nbe sure to watch it,\u201d Palmer said.\n\n\u201cAnd focusing not just on those academic skills, but encouraging and talking\nabout the value of time management during this period of when it might feel\nlike there\u2019s even more down time than there really is,\u201d he said.\n\n **Busy work**\n\nOne question asked if there was advice for students who feel that professors\nhave just been handing out busywork.\n\nCox recommended patience, again, as professors and instructors learn how to\ndeal with the new normal as well.\n\nPalmer said he hoped that no professors were just handing out work that would\nnot be beneficial, but work during this time could be used to give everyone a\nchance to get used to the new medium.\n\n\u201cIf your student is struggling with the volume, again, their best resource and\ntheir best outreach, at least at the first step, is to work with the faculty\nmember directly,\u201d he said. \u201cExplain where they\u2019re coming from; ask for insight\nas to why maybe a particular assignment has been assigned.\n\n\u201cIt would be my hope that as we all get more used to having to provide content\nfrom all across the country, that we would get better at designing and\nimplementing strategies for making sure that the work is meaningful.\u201d\n\nCox, who teaches public speaking at the university, said that some of her in-\nclass assignments she would normally hold may seem like busy work to her\nstudents now.\n\nThings like this take time to figure things out, she said, especially at the\nstart.\n\nThe College of Science and Mathematics has a website prepared to answer all\nstudent questions on registration, classes and more but also to provide\nacademic help.\n\nStudents who have questions about their subjects, such as biology, chemistry,\nmath or physics can join a Slack channel.\n\nThe drop-in center will also have remote appointments through Zoom. The\nmeeting app also will be used for COSAM tutoring at different times, all of\nwhich can be found on the website\n(<https://auburn.edu/cosam/about/online_resources.htm?fbclid=IwAR19HmViLiwWeB4LZkoxXp97lIGAS-\nsj6yOdZKgcw5iCGVwDepTv1PIvrNc>).\n\n **Registration, advising**\n\nRegistration is upon students, but without the ability to meet with their\nadvisers, changes are being made.\n\n\u201cJust as campus courses are being delivered remotely, the Office of Academic\nAdvising will be advising students remotely,\u201d said the Harbert College of\nBusiness\u2019 Facebook post. \u201cBe assured that your academic advisor will continue\nto work with you, though remotely rather than in person. As we transition to a\nnew environment, we ask for your patience. Initial response times could be\nlonger than usual; however, your adviser will respond.\u201d\n\nOnline appointments will be made and can be conducted through email or Zoom.\nTime tickets are already shared with students as well.\n\nCOSAM has a chat room that its students can use.\n\n\u201cIf students have questions for COSAM advisors, attend online \u201cwalk-in\u201d hours\nduring 9-11:30 a.m. and 1:30-4:30 p.m. from Monday through Friday,\u201d its\nwebsite said. \u201cStudents can join the Zoom meeting with this ID: 931-603-7932.\nThis is a CHAT room only. No video or audio.\n\n\u201cPlease click on the Chat function at the bottom to type your question.\u201d\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oanow.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcornoavirus-impact-auburn-university-grapples-with-change-of-plans%2Farticle_a2da2434-be11-5348-b6bf-68514c2d22d5.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Cornoavirus%20impact%3A%20%20Auburn%20University%20grapples%20with%20change%20of%20plans&via=oanow&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oanow.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcornoavirus-impact-auburn-university-grapples-with-change-of-plans%2Farticle_a2da2434-be11-5348-b6bf-68514c2d22d5.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Tweet\")\n  * [ __ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://www.oanow.com/news/local/cornoavirus-impact-auburn-university-grapples-with-change-of-plans/article_a2da2434-be11-5348-b6bf-68514c2d22d5.html \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ __ SMS ](sms:?body=Check%20out%20this%20link:%20www.oanow.com/tncms/asset/editorial/a2da2434-be11-5348-b6bf-68514c2d22d5 \"SMS\")\n  * [ __ Email ](mailto:?subject=%5Boanow.com%5D%20Cornoavirus%20impact%3A%20%20Auburn%20University%20grapples%20with%20change%20of%20plans&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oanow.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcornoavirus-impact-auburn-university-grapples-with-change-of-plans%2Farticle_a2da2434-be11-5348-b6bf-68514c2d22d5.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\n### More information\n\n[ __+6 ![COVID-19 latest: EAMC celebrates patient moving from ICU to regular\nroom after ventilation;

Grading takes center stage as students prepare for unprecedented shift to\nonline classes\n\nBy [TONY SJODIN](https://middleburycampus.com/staff_profile/tony-sjodin/)  \nMarch 28, 2020\n\n![](https://middleburycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FairGradesMidd-\nstory-1.png)\n\n#FairGradesMidd (above) advocates for universal pass/fail and A/A- as fairer\nalternative models to Middlebury's opt-in Pass/D/Fail model. #OptInMidd\n(below) petitions Middlebury to continue with the current opt-in model, which\nit announced on March 16.\n\nThe transition to remote learning sparked debate about equitable grading\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic, after most students were [sent\nhome](https://middleburycampus.com/48879/news/coronavirus/) to continue the\nspring semester on digital platforms such as Zoom and Panopto.\n\nOn March 16, Middlebury\n[announced](https://middleburycampus.com/49052/news/college-offers-pass-d-\nfail-option-for-all-classes-in-spring-semester/#photo) a grading policy that\nwould allow students to continue working toward a letter grade or to opt for a\nPass/D/Fail grade in any class. Because of the emergency nature of the\npandemic, decisions about changing academic policies \u2014 which would typically\nrequire several months of debate and be made with the input of a broader range\nof faculty \u2014 [have been taken\non](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/announcements/previous-\nannouncements/academics-going-forward) by the college\u2019s \u201cad hoc academic\ncontinuity group,\u201d composed of five faculty and five faculty administrators.\n\nFollowing the email announcing the new grading system, some students organized\na petition \u2014 originally titled #NoFailMidd \u2014 to advocate for a universal\npass/fail grading system.\n\nThe five student organizers of #NoFailMidd raised concerns in the petition\nabout socioeconomic inequalities inherent in an opt-in Pass/D/Fail system,\nciting a lack of resources or added responsibilities at home as challenges\nthat might push some students toward the Pass/D/Fail option, while allowing\ntheir more privileged peers to pursue GPA-boosting letter grades.\n\nFollowing the launch of #NoFailMidd, other student advocates launched a sister\ncampaign pushing for a Dual A policy modeled after some Harvard students\u2019\n\u201c[Double A proposal](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/19/harvard-\ncoronavirus-grading-system-petitions/)\u201d. The two campaigns have since merged,\nevolving into #FairGradesMidd. An [updated\npetition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8EgCn42w-6EEomIM21GN49VBW0cZ9IYItk-\njI3vIhs/edit) and an [op-\ned](https://middleburycampus.com/49227/opinion/circumstance-is-not-choice-but-\ncommunity-is/) in The Campus, written by organizers, have since been\npublicized.\n\n\u201cPeople have come out and acknowledged how this approach that the college is\ntaking is really blind to privilege,\u201d said Arthur Martins \u201922.5, one of the\norganizers of the petition. \u201cWhen we talk about any argument that\u2019s about\nchoice, we need to see it as a material reality. If you have two people that\nhave very different material circumstances, you can\u2019t ask them to make the\nsame choice.\u201d\n\nMartins said the petition now has over 1,000 signatures. The petition\nencourages students to contact their representatives from the Student\nGovernment Association (SGA), as well as faculty members, to advocate for\ntheir prefered grading method.\n\n\u201cAt Middlebury \u2026 everyone had the classroom to go to, everyone could go to the\ndining hall, have a meal, go back to the library, do their work. All the work\nthat was happening had support, and everyone had access to a very similar\nstructure of support,\u201d Martins said.\n\nOther educational institutions across the country have also been grappling\nwith an unprecedented shift to online classes, and the consequences that shift\nhas for existing grading systems. Several other universities have adopted\nuniversal pass/fail or similar systems, including undergraduate programs at\nDartmouth College, Columbia University, Bowdoin College and MIT, as well law\nschools at Harvard University and Stanford University. Organizers at Yale\nUniversity \u2014 another institution considering a shift to mandatory pass/fail \u2014\n[sparked the movement](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/03/18/students-\ncall-for-universal-pass/) with their \u201cNo Fail Yale\u201d\n[petition](https://www.facebook.com/NoFailYale/).\n\nAt Harvard, dynamic debates and frequent stance reversals reflect the\ncomplexity of the fair grading movement on all fronts. The college\u2019s\nundergraduate council \u2014 its SGA equivalent \u2014 reversed its stance three times\nin 24 hours on which grading system to endorse, The Harvard Crimson\n[reported](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/27/uc-endorses-double-a/)\nearlier this week. The latest update from the college announced that it would\nfollow a [universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading\nsystem](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/28/harvard-coronavirus-\nuniversal-satisfactory-unsatisfactory-grading/).\n\nMiddlebury\u2019s SGA does not currently plan to endorse any one model, but will\nhear the different proposals at its Sunday meeting so that it can develop a\nsurvey to gauge student opinion.\n\n**Movements collide**\n\nThe initial #NoFailMidd petition was met with opposition on two fronts: some\nstudents called for the opt-in system to continue, while other students\nbelieved a Dual A system \u2014 where every student receives either an A or an A-\nin each class \u2014 would be fairer.\n\nThe organizers of #NoFailMidd, who see it as their mission to generate\nconversation on equitable grading this semester, reached out to the students\nadvocating for Dual A and incorporated their ideas into the new\n#FairGradesMidd petition, which outlines the strengths of both the universal\npass/fail system and the Dual A system.\n\n![](https://middleburycampus.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3282-475x297.jpeg)\n\nThe initial #NoFailMidd petition changed to #FairGradesMidd in response to\nstudent feedback.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents have voiced concerns, both in class Facebook groups and\nin Campus op-eds, about students being insufficiently motivated or not\nproperly learning the material if they are not given the option of pursuing\nletter grades. There are also questions about whether graduate programs that\ntypically require letter grades will accept pass/fail classes taken this\nsemester, and that students \u2014 especially seniors \u2014 will not have the chance to\nboost their GPAs with grades from this semester.\n\nPriya Kaur, \u201922, Yasmine Signey \u201922, Nellie Zhang \u201923 and Maya David \u201923\nstarted a counter petition, titled\n[#OptInMidd](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMZlLBBUUPU98SjgqadUM4sqBBOJeKhHlPOIIsTWTh8/edit?fbclid=IwAR174fHmwqtPdVmWeOUAxQbtYk6yoUyd700gwO_bzkuOWvtQ_C3KjkJ3Yvo),\ndescribing the case for a continued opt-in pass/fail system.\n\nAdvocates of the Dual A system say it can operate as a middle ground between\nthe two proposals. Students would still receive letter grades for their work,\nbut the system would be more uniform and therefore more supportive of students\nin vulnerable situations, according to Chloe Fleisher \u201921.5, an organizer who\njoined #FairGradesMidd when Dual A was added. Students applying to\npostgraduate programs, internships and jobs or looking to maintain scholarship\neligibility would see their GPA positively impacted, while allowing greater\naccommodations for their new situations.\n\n\u201cThis rewards students for the work that they have already done and for being\nable to work in really adverse conditions in a global pandemic, and basically\ncreates, in my view, the most equitable system,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an email to The Campus, the organizers of the #OptInMidd counter petition\nsaid they were glad that the #NoFailMidd organizers recognized its call for\nmaintaining a grades-based grading system for the semester. \u201cWe also support a\nDual A grading system, but with some hesitations,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe organizers of #OptInMidd expressed hope that under a system like Dual A,\nMiddlebury students would adhere to the Honor Code and work for their grades.\nBut they maintained concerns that students would abuse the system or not put\nin enough effort to learn the material.\n\n\u201cWe believe that opt-in Pass/D/Fail encourages students to do their best since\nthey are still graded in the typical manner, but can also provide a choice for\nall,\u201d the #OptInMidd organizers said.\n\n**Calling the shots**\n\nNeither the updated #FairGradesMidd proposal nor the #OptInMidd petition were\navailable when the academic continuity group last met on Thursday morning. But\nthe committee did discuss the universal pass/fail proposal at length.\n\n\u201cWe are most definitely interested in a solution that guarantees as much\nequity as possible,\u2019 said Luso-Hispanic Studies Professor Daniel Silva in an\nemail to The Campus. Silva serves on the academic continuity group as a\nrepresentative for the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion faculty committee.\n\n\u201cWe will be meeting again early next week and will likely discuss the new\ndevelopments and options,\u201d he added. \u201cMany of our students are facing\ntremendous challenges back home due to the pandemic that are unimaginable to\nmany other members of the Middlebury community. My hope is that we find a\nsolution that addresses their needs first and foremost.\u201d\n\nSome professors have already voiced their support for pass/fail grading.\nAllison Stanger, a Middlebury professor currently on sabbatical and teaching\nat Harvard, recently wrote an op-ed for The Chronicle of Higher Education\nadvocating for colleges to move to pass/fail. The Campus\n[reprinted](https://middleburycampus.com/49242/opinion/make-all-courses-pass-\nfail-now/) that op-ed online.\n\n\u201cIt is unjust to assume that there is a level playing field for students who\nhave been forced to leave campus,\u201d Stanger said in an email to The Campus. \u201cWe\nassume that it is so when we bring students together on campus, even though it\nisn\u2019t the case, but it is a bridge too far to maintain that assumption in a\nglobal pandemic.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Martins, the #FairGradesMidd organizer, invites students to\nshare testimonials about their experiences, sign onto the various petitions\nand contact their representatives about the changes they want to see.\n\n\u201cI think [students] are already being impacted positively through the\nprocess,\u201d Martins said. \u201cThis is a grassroots movement \u2026 I hope it leaves this\nquestion of what can student activism look like, what can engagement with the\ncommunity really look like? I think that it\u2019s really been a beautiful exercise\nof community-making.\u201d\n\n_Editor 's note: The Campus has published multiple op-eds on suggestions about\ngrading policy.

Without hesitation, I replied\nthat I had been humbled and deeply gratified by the tremendous spirit of\ncooperation that you, as faculty and staff, have demonstrated in achieving our\ncommon purpose of transitioning to remote learning within 10 days.\"\n\nA. Scott Weber, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs\n\nIn this unprecedented university-wide shift to working from home, distance\nlearning and online classes, students and faculty should remember something\nalmost guaranteed to help unscramble the inevitable challenges: There is\nrelief, advice and assistance everywhere. All you need to do is look around\nand ask. Being non-essential does not mean you don't matter.\n\nAn impressive and resourceful support system coming in time for the first week\nof working at home and online classes has taken off. And the significance of\nit goes beyond helping faculty, staff and students continue their work.\n\nAnyone looking for evidence of a university-wide community during the COVID-19\npandemic is in luck. This shopping mall of services created by UB\nadministrators, faculty and staff reaching out to those facing the abrupt\ntransition from office to home and classroom to Webex is a bright spot in an\notherwise uncertain time.\n\nIt also helps explain how UB has transitioned more than 4,000 classes,\nincluding labs, into online courses in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"Recently, I was asked by someone from outside the UB community what I had\nlearned since taking the position of provost,\" wrote A. Scott Weber, provost\nand executive vice president for academic affairs, in an email to UB employees\nsent March 23.\n\n\"Without hesitation, I replied that I had been humbled and deeply gratified by\nthe tremendous spirit of cooperation that you, as faculty and staff, have\ndemonstrated in achieving our common purpose of transitioning to remote\nlearning within 10 days. Together we will ensure that we are continuing to\ndeliver the very best education possible to our students in these\nextraordinary times.\"\n\n## CEI: Your guide to online teaching\n\nIn some cases, the feast of virtual conferencing and online help sites has\nbeen overwhelming, making them hard to sort through. In any event, it's being\ndone with flair and intelligence, and sometimes even a wry humor.\n\nUp first, in no special order, UB's Center for Educational Innovation (CEI),\nwhich partnered with UB Information Technology and University Libraries to run\nback-to-back emergency courses to help teachers make the transition to\ndistance learning.\n\nThe two-hour sessions were open to faculty, adjunct lecturers, graduate\nteaching assistants and others seeking guidance on how to use technology to\nbuild effective online classes - as documented in a [UBNow\nstory](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/campus.host.html/content/shared/university/news/ub-\nreporter-articles/stories/2020/03/cei-online-teaching.detail.html).\n\nOnline teaching resources and a link to register for an emergency online\ncourse-building session are available on [CEI's\nwebsite](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubcei.html).\n\n## UBIT springs into action with new online tools\n\nQuickly following the announcement to distance learning, the offices of J.\nBrice Bible, Graham Hammill and Robert Granfield sent out a [detailed\nmemo](https://www.buffalo.edu/academicaffairs/academic-resources.html) to\nfaculty sharing important dates, guidelines [and\ninformation](https://www.buffalo.edu/academicaffairs/academic-resources.html)\non campus resources.\n\nThey also sent faculty to a site offering [emergency course-building\nsessions](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/news/article.host.html/content/shared/www/ubit/news/2020/remote-\nteaching.detail.html) and resources for [students preparing for distance\nlearning.](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/news/article.host.html/content/shared/www/ubit/news/2020/distance-\nlearning.detail.html)\n\n\"The university is fully committed to providing resources to support faculty,\nstudents and staff during the transition to distance learning,\" said Bible,\nvice president and chief information officer. \"UB Information Technology is\npleased to have fast-tracked a rollout of\n[Zoom](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/zoom) to better assist our community\nmembers with remote collaboration. UBIT will facilitate online trainings on\nZoom beginning the week of March 23rd.\"\n\nBible said UBIT recently provided in-depth sessions on\n[Panopto](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/panopto) and\n[Webex](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/webex) collaboration tools, and partnered\nwith the CEI and University Libraries on the emergency course-building\ntraining sessions for faculty.\n\nTips for working from home\n\nAlex Reid, director of writing across the curriculum in the Department of\nEnglish, offers this advice to ease the transition for those working remotely:  \n\u2022    Try to create a dedicated workspace.\n\n\u2022    Create a structure for your day. For example, set specific hours for\nworking and accomplishing tasks.\n\n\u2022    Have a technology backup plan, especially for synchronous activities.\nHopefully, Webex and Zoom will work well for everyone, but it's more likely\nthere will be glitches.\n\n\u2022    Keep things simple and be as explicit and straightforward as possible.\nNow isn't the time to ask students or colleagues to take on any more technical\nchallenges than are necessary. \"We may be surprised how much we rely on\nnonverbal cues and informal conversation to communicate and get things done,\"\nReid says. \"We're going to have to do without a lot of that, so it's important\nto be as clear as possible.\"\n\n\u2022    Be easy on yourself -- and others. \"I'm guessing we'll find everyone\nworking at a distance is very challenging, not only in technical terms but\ngenerally as a means for communicating, coordinating and collaborating,\" Reid\nsays. \"Even when the technology works as expected, there will still be plenty\nof opportunities for frustration.\n\n## PSS to help with your 'now different work life'\n\nThen there was the Professional Staff Senate (PSS). PSS Chair Tim Tryjankowski\nsent an email to professional staff acknowledging \"another wave of newness\" as\nstudents get back to studies post spring break.\n\n\"I'm sure we will all have another learning curve of our own to conquer then,\"\nhe wrote. \"Please take care of yourselves while also taking care of your work\nresponsibilities!\"\n\nTryjankowski said he had asked PSS senators and committee chairs to think\nabout ways to communicate and plan for their changing role in the days ahead,\n\"after we acclimate to students being in session.\"\n\n\"If you have any needs, issues, concerns or helpful tips regarding your now\ndifferent work life,\" he wrote, \"please share them with your area senators,\nwho will share things up through our representative body.\"\n\nIndividual departments have joined the mission. Alex Reid, director of writing\nacross the curriculum in the Department of English, sent an email out to\nfaculty on March 16.\n\n\"Our goal is not to give you one more thing to do or check, but hopefully to\nmake the task we have a little easier,\" Reid wrote.\n\nHe announced a special content area on teaching online, as well as plans to\nrun live Webex sessions, recording them and making them widely available.\n\n\"We created a UBLearns space where we are sharing support materials and links\nto existing resources,\" he wrote. \"We'll also be running live workshops and\nsupport sessions in Webex or Zoom in the coming weeks.\"\n\n## Responding to concerns with a personal touch\n\nThrough this, Reid maintained a personal touch, responding to individual\nfaculty requests and offering to do one-on-one video talks with faculty on\nWebex and other online teaching methods.\n\n\"This is the unfortunate future I never knew I was preparing for,\" he wrote.\n\"I am here as a resource if you need me.\"\n\nReid also has written blog posts on the subject: [One offers advice to online\ninstructors](https://profalexreid.com/2020/03/11/advice-for-the-unplanned-\nonline-class/), while another contains [guidance for\nstudents](https://profalexreid.com/2020/03/16/advice-to-students-who-\nunexpectedly-enrolled-in-an-online-university/), with a foolproof opening to\nget them to read.\n\n\"First of all, I understand how much this probably sucks,\" Reid wrote in his\n\"advice to students who unexpectedly enrolled in an online university.\"\n\n\"I've been a professor for 20+ years, but right now my son is a college\nfreshman and my daughter was looking forward to enjoying a victory lap in her\nfinal semester as a college senior before heading off to a PhD program. Of\ncourse, there are more pressing concerns, but we can take a moment to\nrecognize that this sucks, too.\n\n\"My personal recourse is to the philosophy of the Stoics,\" he wrote in\nconclusion. \"Depending on your faith, you might recognize this as a precursor\nto the Serenity Prayer. Happiness always lies in aligning our desires with\nobjectives that are within our power to achieve. You can apply that advice\ngenerally, but here I'd say you might apply that advice to the next few weeks\nof your online education.\n\n\"The only thing I know for sure,\" Reid wrote to conclude a blog entry, \"is\nthat we are in this together.\"\n\n## Tech problem?
