Applicable to any\ntype of UK organisation, the scheme is also open to full and part time\nemployees, plus those on agency contracts or flexible/zero hour contracts.\n\nOf the 2,600 people that took part in our weekly poll, 45 per said that a\nlarge number of employees at their company had been placed on furlough leave.\nA quarter of respondents said that furlough was currently applicable to a\nsmall number of employees, and 30 per cent reported that its business as usual\nat their company.\n\n[Click here for more information on the Coronavirus job retention\nscheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-\ncoronavirus-job-retention-scheme)\n\nIn the comments that followed, Dave Richardson said: \"My firm has furloughed\nmore than half its mobile engineer workforce and are not planning to make up\nthe 20% shortfall in pay. And now are planning to subcontract out work, on an\nad hoc basis to fill the gap between manpower and capacity required. That\ncannot be right surely? And it seems that although the furloughed staff are to\nget 80% of their basic pay, those who are still working, should they fall ill,\nwill only be entitled to SSP. I looked in the mirror, but couldn't see \"mug\"\non my forehead, but it sure feels like it!\"\n\nBrian said: \"A company has a requirement to remain solvent. They can't pay you\nif there is no money coming in without racking up huge debits, which will put\nthe business in jeopardy. Like the laws of physics, the laws of economics\ncan't be broken no matter how nice you think it might be!\"\n\nEmployer Craig added: ** \"**My understanding would be that the alternative is\nredundancies. I am in a similar position, but I am the employer. We are keen\nto furlough all staff but have no way of paying them until the monies arrive\nfrom government and we don't want to proceed with forced redundancies either.\nIt's a very difficult position for both employees and employer.\"\n\nWhat do you think?

I'm an employer myself so i know this well, the shortest period\nthey can furlough you is 3 weeks, after that time you can be called back in to\nwork if things change, equally, they have every right to let you go -\ndepending on your contract this could be instant dismissal or you could have\nto work out your notice period/ leave period.\n\nthe issue with this scheme is that employers have to pay the staff first and\nhope that the government refunds them the money via a grant. If a business is\nalready really struggling with cash flow and can't access the funds needed,\nthen they may not even be able to afford to furlough someone.\n\nhope you can get some money back.\n\n[https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-self-employed-and-\nemployment-\nhelp/?utm_source=MSE_Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=31-Mar-20-50599895-1067&utm_campaign=nt-\nhiya&utm_content=18#limited](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-\nself-employed-and-employment-\nhelp/?utm_source=MSE_Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=31-Mar-20-50599895-1067&utm_campaign=nt-\nhiya&utm_content=18#limited)\n\nReply [Link](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-\nfurlough/#comment-330558)\n\n  * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee094bea79a158c068ae8d4071a265c1?s=64&d=blank&r=g)\n\nLawrence 1st April 2020 at 8:36 am\n\nWe are currently on a two week mandatory holiday our employee says we cannot\nhave furlough as we are not on jobs at risk our company has a very large\nnumber of men in furlough on a site in hull and yet are not on jobs at risk.\nWe have been told we will return maybe next week as they have put measures in\nplace to keep us safe ?

However with the current situation\npeople need to start acting with a decent moral compass! Many company high\nearners could easliy take pay cuts saving jobs by providing a cash-flow buffer\ninstead of adding to the Rolex collection. Also lets think of all the NHS\nworkers and for me especially the district Nurses who in some cases are\ncurrently having to visit known COVID-19 patients in their homes with the only\nprotection a paper apron, gloves and a reused paper face mask. These Nurses\nare struggling to provide community patient care with little protection and\nthey know that; like lambs the the slaughter.

Abraham is an economist at the University of Maryland who served\nas a member the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama\nadministration.\n\nSusan N. Houseman is vice president and director of research at the Upjohn\nInstitute for Employment Research.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is causing massive disruption to the U.S. economy as\nglobal supply chains break down, travel is canceled and people practice\n\u201csocial distancing,\u201d avoiding everything from restaurants and retail outlets\nto conferences and office meetings. One-fifth of U.S. workers [already\nreport](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817158521/poll-\nnearly-1-in-5-households-have-lost-work-because-of-pandemic) losing hours or\nwork because of the pandemic.\n\nWorker layoffs are often seen as an inevitable part of an economic crisis like\nthe one we\u2019re living through. Unfortunately, job losses carry a high price for\nindividuals and the economy\u2014laid-off workers have less income to take care of\ntheir families, lose access to health insurance and deepen the economic crisis\nby spending less. And, laying off workers can even slow a recovery when\nemployers must spend valuable time and money to rebuild their workforce as the\neconomy improves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, unless a business has been forced to fully close, there\u2019s a way to keep\nworkers on the payroll, ease the pain of a downturn and speed economic\nrecovery. It\u2019s called \u201cwork-sharing.\u201d\n\nThis is an idea that [other countries have\nused](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/work_sharing_abraham_houseman.pdf)\nin past downturns to far greater effect than the United States. State and\nfederal officials should act now to ramp up this option here. [Twenty-six\nstates](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/docs/stc_fact_sheet.pdf) covering\nabout 70 percent of the U.S. workforce already have formal programs to provide\nfinancial help to employers who embrace shared-work policies; those states\nneed to do more to make employers aware of the option. And states that don\u2019t\nyet have formal shared-work programs can and should put them in place quickly.\n\nHere\u2019s how work-sharing, or \u201cshort-time compensation\u201d programs work.\n\nEmployers experiencing a temporary reduction in business agree to cut\nemployees\u2019 hours instead of laying off workers entirely. Employees on reduced\nhours receive unemployment benefits in proportion to the reduction in their\nhours. Businesses benefit by retaining valued employees and avoiding\nrecruitment and training costs when economic conditions return to normal.\nWorkers benefit by retaining most of their income and access to health\ninsurance \u2014 a critical factor in a public health-triggered economic crisis\nlike this one.\n\nBy helping to keep people in their jobs, work-share programs mitigate\nunemployment. And short-time compensation benefits are well targeted, reaching\nexactly the people who are suffering a drop in earnings and are likely to need\nthe money the most. In this sense, they are better targeted and more likely to\nprovide direct economic stimulus than cutting payroll taxes or sending checks\nto everyone.\n\nIn short, shared-work programs are specifically designed to help businesses\nand workers\u2014and their communities\u2014get through temporary economic disruptions\nlike those caused by COVID-19.\n\nBusiness\n[surveys](https://www.impaqint.com/sites/default/files/files/ETAOP-2016-01_Final-\nReport-Acc.pdf) show that employers using shared-compensation programs are\noverwhelmingly very satisfied with them. The problem is that, even in states\nwith a short-term compensation program, most businesses don\u2019t know about the\noption. During the Great Recession\u2014a period when shared work could have been\nhelpful to many businesses\u2014[relatively\nfew](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/181/) employers operating in\nstates with shared-work programs made use of them. In response, the Middle\nClass Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included provisions to bolster\nuse. Under the law, the federal government funded state marketing to raise\nemployer awareness about the program and reimbursed states\u2019 short-time\ncompensation costs for three years.\n\n[Our research](https://research.upjohn.org/externalpapers/75/) shows that even\nmodest efforts to advertise short-time compensation programs can significantly\nraise employer awareness and use. In large demonstration projects done in\ncooperation with Oregon and Iowa, we found that low-key advertising campaigns\nraised employer awareness of the shared-work option by 15 to 30 percentage\npoints. In Oregon, these efforts increased employer participation in work-\nshare plans by 50 to 100 percent. These demonstrations were run during an\neconomic expansion; Outreach should be even more effective during a\nslowdown\u2014like the one we are currently experiencing.\n\nWhat should states and the federal government do now to ensure that employers\ncan and will implement work-sharing?\n\n**_First, states with short-time compensation options should_ _do more to_\n_get the word out to employers_.** Public service announcements, mailings and\ntargeted outreach in industries where sales are especially hard-hit by the\ncoronavirus outbreak can be effective ways to quickly reach businesses that\nmight benefit from the program. Federal subsidies could help to spur such\noutreach.\n\n**_Second, the federal government should subsidize states\u2019 short-time\ncompensation programs during the COVID-19 crisis_.** Under existing law,\nemployers\u2019 unemployment insurance tax rates are tied to the past benefits paid\nto their workers. This means that many employers\u2019 unemployment insurance tax\nrates will increase if they lay off workers or use work-share programs.\nCongress should pass legislation providing reimbursement to states for the\ncosts of work-share benefits paid during the current crisis and stipulate that\nthe tax rates of employers who set up short-time compensation plans will not\ngo up. Some employers might choose to reduce employee hours instead of laying\noff people regardless, but unless they participate in a work-share program,\ntheir employees will not have access to prorated unemployment insurance\nbenefits. Removing the tax consequences of participation in work share should\nincrease employer use of this beneficial program that gets money to people who\nneed it.\n\n**_Third, states without a short-time compensation option should move quickly\nto adopt it as part of their unemployment insurance system_.** The current\ncrisis\u2014which we hope will be relatively short-lived\u2014is a perfect example of\nthe circumstances in which short-time compensation can be most helpful to\nbusinesses, workers and communities. It\u2019s better for workers and for their\ncommunities if temporary downturns don\u2019t turn into permanent job loss. Every\nstate in the country needs this option.\n\nShort-time compensation is a crisis-mitigation tool we already have in our\narsenal to fight this pandemic\u2019s economic fallout. [Other\ncountries](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-\ndevelopment/corporate/notices/coronavirus.html) already are taking steps to\nencourage the use of shared work during this crisis. Federal and state\ndecision-makers need to act quickly to make it available throughout the United\nStates. The health of our population \u2014 and our economy \u2014 may depend on it.  \n\n  * Filed Under:\n  * [Opinion](https://www.politico.com/news/opinion),\n  * [Economy](https://www.politico.com/news/economy),\n  * [Jobs](https://www.politico.com/news/jobs),\n  * [Coronavirus](https://www.politico.com/latest-news-updates/coronavirus)\n\nShow Comments\n\n[ ******** POLITICO ](https://www.politico.com/)\n\n  * [ Facebook ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/3daRCsk&pubid=politico.com)\n  * [ Twitter ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/3daRCsk&text=Opinion+%7C+The+Smart+Way+to+Save+Jobs+in+the+Time+of+Coronavirus&pubid=politico.com&via=politico)\n  * Link\n    * Link Copied\n\n  * More\n    * [ Mail ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#605f140f5d46010d105b1315020a0503145d34080540330d0112144037011940140f4033011605402a0f021340090e401408054034090d05400f0640230f120f0e01160912151346010d105b020f04195d08141410135a4f4f1717174e100f0c091409030f4e030f0d4f0e0517134f0107050e04014f525052504f50534f51584f130d0112144d1701194d130116054d0a0f02134d030f120f0e0116091215134d515355555454)\n    * [ Reddit ](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://politi.co/3daRCsk&title=Opinion+%7C+The+Smart+Way+to+Save+Jobs+in+the+Time+of+Coronavirus)\n    * [ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://politi.co/3daRCsk)\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.politico.com/about-us)\n  * [Advertising](https://www.politico.com/advertising)\n  * [Breaking News Alerts](https://www.politico.com/subscribe/breaking-news-alerts)\n  * [Careers](https://www.politico.com/careers)\n  * [Credit Card Payments](https://secure.politico.com/payment)\n  * [Digital Edition](http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?bypass=true&PBID=74262970-aa07-44b3-80c8-21fa8a8ac376)\n  * [FAQ](https://www.politico.com/faq)\n  * [Feedback](https://www.politico.com/feedback)\n  * [Headlines](https://www.politico.com/politics)\n  * [Photos](https://www.politico.com/gallery)\n  * [POWERJobs](http://www.powerjobs.com/)\n  * [Press](https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-press)\n  * [Print Subscriptions](https://www.politico.com/subscriptions)\n  * [Write For Us](https://www.politico.com/write-for-us)\n  * [RSS](https://www.politico.com/rss)\n  * [Site Map](https://www.politico.com/sitemap)\n\n  * [Terms of Service](https://www.politico.com/terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.politico.com/privacy-policy)\n  * [Do not sell my info](https://www.politico.com/do-not-sell)\n\n(C) 2020 POLITICO LLC\n\n"}, {"item": "Layoffs, furloughs, or pay cuts?

US\ncompanies shed 27,000 jobs in March, according to a private survey, a figure\nthat mostly reflected the economy as it stood before the full impact of the\nviral outbreak. Many companies are left with a decision about whether to keep\npaying employees fully, in part, or at all.David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\n\nSome employees are out of a job entirely. Some are off work without pay until\nthe COVID-19 emergency ends and their workplaces can reopen. Some are doing\nthe same job, but for less pay. As employers reckon with catastrophic declines\nin revenue, they face a slate of unappealing choices in how to manage payroll.\n\nLayoffs, furloughs, and salary reductions can all buy struggling businesses\ntime, but they come at a substantial human cost. And the decisions that\ncompanies make now will determine how quickly they\u2019ll be able to resume\noperations when the public health and economic crises subside.\n\n\u201cI find that a lot of employers are reluctant to do permanent layoffs,\nbecause, frankly, this is such an unusual event that no one can accurately\npredict what\u2019s going to happen just a few months from now,\u201d said Christopher\nFeudo, an employment attorney at Foley Hoag LLP who serves on the firm\u2019s\nCOVID-19 task force.\n\nDespite the uncertain fallout from the viral pandemic, however, many employers\nare in such dire shape that they feel they have no other choice but to make\ncuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nNancy Waldron, a business professor at Lasell University, said businesses that\ndon\u2019t have a realistic hope of recovering fully from the economic shock would\nbe best served to level with their staffers and give them a clean break.\n\n\u201cYou have to be really open with your employees at any time of great change,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cIf you are furloughing workers, that gives them a little sliver of\nhope.\u201d\n\nFurloughs, or temporary layoffs, qualify people [for unemployment insurance in\nMassachusetts ](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/employer-unemployment-faq-\ncovid-19#q.-if-i-furlough-all-or-part-of-my-workforce,-will-they-be-able-to-\ncollect-unemployment?-)if they are caused by the coronavirus outbreak. They\nalso give a business a better shot at quickly reassembling its workforce when\nthe conditions are right.\n\nStill, they are not to be taken lightly, employers say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nTony Maws, chef-owner of Craigie on Main in Cambridge, furloughed about 40\nemployees, while keeping on staff five workers to do take out and delivery.\n\nMaws decided to let people go because he doesn\u2019t have the cash flow to keep\nthem on the payroll. Business is dramatically down, even with delivery\nservice. Maws\u2019s goal is to have enough savings to reopen and rehire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about long term,\u201d Maws explained. \u201cI want you to have a job to\ncome back to.\u201d\n\nA somewhat less drastic \u2015 if still painful \u2015 decision being taken by some\ncompanies is a temporary reduction in pay for employees during a period of\nfinancial stress.\n\nSuch a measure may be combined with furloughs as a way for businesses to\ncontinue operating as fully as possible while facing what they hope are\ntemporary cash flow problems. Pay reductions, depending on the job, may come\nwith a decrease in working hours, or be offset by the prospect of bonuses\nlater. But they keep employees on the payroll.\n\nWaldron said that pay cuts for the rank-and-file should be accompanied by\ndecreases for management. Senior executives can create a lot of good will if\nthey are the first to absorb the financial hit, she added.\n\nThe $2 trillion federal stimulus package provides an incentive for some\nemployers to retain their workforces as they wait out the virus. The new [law\noffers small businesses](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/31/business/what-\nsmall-business-owners-need-know-about-2-trillion-stimulus-\npackage/?p1=SectionFront_Feed_AuthorQuery) and nonprofits forgivable loans to\npay employees\u2019 salaries or bring back those they\u2019ve laid off, and to cover\ncosts such as rent and utilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 relatively new casino industry provides a glimpse into the\ncomplex calculus that companies are considering as they decide how to handle a\ncrushing loss of income. All three of the state\u2019s casinos agreed to pay at\nleast their full-time workers for two weeks after state regulators shut them\ndown in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut as business closures have spread here and around the country, the owners\nof MGM Springfield and Plainridge Park have placed huge swaths of their\nworkforces on furlough.\n\nMeanwhile, Encore Boston Harbor says it will keep all of its full- and part-\ntime employees on the payroll through May 15 under a companywide decision\nannounced this week by Matt Maddox, chief executive of parent company Wynn\nResorts.\n\nThe company came into the crisis with an enviable balance sheet, which left it\nwith options that other businesses don\u2019t have. Encore president Brian\nGullbrants said in an interview this week that the decision to keep paying\nemployees will make a smooth reopening more likely whenever it is allowed to\nresume operations.\n\nHe noted that the process of hiring and training a workforce that now numbers\naround 4,300 was a massive effort that would be costly to repeat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested so much in these people in time and effort, and hard work, and\nin money, that these ladies and gentlemen aren\u2019t just a payroll number,\" he\nsaid. \u201cThey\u2019re the company\u2019s most valued asset.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nCarlos Aramayo, president of UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents workers at\nEncore and in many other parts of the hard-hit hospitality industry, said in\nan interview that there are many owners of hotels and other facilities that\nwould do well to take note of what places like Encore, Harvard, and MIT are\ndoing by continuing to pay wages.\n\nWhile not every organization has the financial strength to keep workers on\nfull pay through a shutdown of indefinite length, he said, moves to keep\npeople on benefits or able to receive some compensation will eventually reap\ndividends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us as a society to recognize the value that people create\nthrough the work that they do every single day,\" he said. \u201cWhile people are\nfeeling a pinch right now . . . all of us need to remind ourselves of that and\nfigure out how all of us can bear the brunt of this economic hit and not have\nit just borne by those workers.\u201d\n\n _Shirley Leung of the Globe staff and Globe correspondent Anissa Gardizy\ncontributed to this report._\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\nAndy Rosen can be reached at\n[andrew.rosen@globe.com](mailto:andrew.rosen@globe.com).

Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered nearly **300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns**.\n  * The government is delivering an additional **600,000 N95 masks to New York City** to support its public hospital system, as requested by Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The [Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/DJIA) slipped 26.13 points, or\n0.1%, to close at 22,653.86. The [S&P\n500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) lost 4.27 points, or 0.16%, to\nend at 2659.41, and the [Nasdaq\nComposite](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/COMP) fell 25.98 points, or\n0.33%, to close at 7887.26.\n\nNew York state reported its biggest single-day increase in deaths since the\ncoronavirus outbreak began, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The pandemic has\nnow killed a total of 5,489 people in the state. New Jersey and Louisiana\n[also saw their largest single-day increases in\ndeaths](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-coronavirus-death-toll-\nnears-75-000-as-lockdowns-\ntighten-11586254730?mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=article_inline) since the outbreak.\n\nThere are now a total of 374,329 reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. as of\nTuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\nrepresented daily growth of about 13%, following two promising days of\nbelow-10% growth rates. The number of deaths rose by 3,154, or 35%, to 12,064.\n\nEnergy stocks jumped sharply early Tuesday [along with the rise of oil\nprices](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-rebounds-as-g20-prepares-to-\nmeet-51586269874?mod=hp_INTERESTS_oil&refsec=hp_INTERESTS_oil&mod=article_inline),\nbut most gains were lost by the end of the session. Still, the sector\u2014up 2.1%\nfor the day\u2014was the second-best performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nAfter rallying last week, oil prices have posted two consecutive days of big\ndrops. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 9.39% to $23.63 per barrel\non Tuesday, while the Brent crude dropped 3.57% to $31.87.\n\n#### Editor's Choice\n\nInvestors continue to carefully weigh the possibility of coordinated action on\noil production cuts across some of the world\u2019s largest producers. The\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies are expected to\nhost a virtual meeting on Thursday and G-20 energy ministers are expected to\ntalk on Friday. Russia and Saudi Arabia have both shown willingness to curb\ntheir output significantly to support oil prices. Still, any signs of a\npotential collapse of the talk could drive crude oil prices into yet another\nlow.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that the department will ask\nfor [an additional $250 billion funding for the small business loan\nprogram](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-to-ask-for-additional-250-bn-for-\nsmall-business-loans-mnuchin-01586285407?tesla=y&mod=article_inline), helping\ncompanies cover costs like payroll and rent during the coronavirus-triggered\nbusiness reduction and shutdown.\n\nThe so-called Payroll Protection Program was part of the massive economic\nrelief package passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald\nTrump more than a week ago. It was initially funded with $349 billion, but\n[banks have been overwhelmed with loan\nrequests](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/small-business-owners-express-\nconfusion-fear-over-federal-bailout-fund-2020-04-04?mod=article_inline).\nMnuchin said he had reached out to Democrats and Republicans in Congress for\nmore money.\n\nJapan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Tuesday a stimulus package valued\nat nearly $1 trillion, with more than $350 billion [in direct spending to\ncombat the impact of the coronavirus\nepidemic.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-plans-direct-payments-to-\nhouseholds-businesses-in-coronavirus-emergency-11586263242?mod=article_inline)\nAbe also declared a state of emergency, which allows the governors of seven\nprefectures to request businesses to close.\n\nDon\u2019t call it a lockdown, though. \u201cThe expert opinion is we do not need to\nlock down our cities like they have done abroad,\u201d Abe said. \u201cAs a government,\nwe aim to minimize the impact on the economy and society.\u201d The emergency\npowers will stay in place for a month and may be extended or expanded to\nadditional parts of the country.\n\n**Write to** Evie Liu at [evie.liu@barrons.com](mailto:evie.liu@barrons.com)\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### The Dow Slipped 26 Points Because the Coronavirus Epidemic Is Persistent\n\nU.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nMessage\n\nSEND\n\nAn error has occurred, please try again later.\n\nThank you\n\nThis article has been sent to\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/barrons?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/barronsonline/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/company/41970?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://www.instagram.com/Barrons/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Cookie Notice](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Copyright Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/copyright-\npolicy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Data Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/data-policy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Your Ad Choices](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=hp_FOOTER#cookies-\nadvertising)\n\n[Subscriber Agreement & Terms of\nUse](https://www.barrons.com/about/subscriber-agreement?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\nCopyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

His staff has been working\n18-to-20-hour days to manually process the loans, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYes, we have money flowing,\u201d Howell said in an interview, adding that the\nbank would soon be able to automate much of the process. \u201cI have customers\ncall me in tears thanking me when they\u2019ve received the money.\u201d\n\nThe SBA\u2019s coronavirus loan program got off to a rocky start Friday. Lenders\ncomplained about not having enough guidance to process loans and problems\nconnecting with the SBA\u2019s system. Some borrowers reported not being able to\nsubmit applications because they didn\u2019t have an existing relationship with\nbanks.\n\nAD\n\nThe SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program is part of the $2 trillion stimulus\npackage intended to shore up the economy. It offers loans of as much $10\nmillion that convert to grants if firms use the funds to keep workers on their\npayroll and maintain salaries.\n\nThe Treasury Department is asking Congress for $250 billion more for the\nprogram and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate could act\nas soon as this week to authorize additional money.\n\nAD\n\nStill, some small business owners did get money in their accounts the very\nfirst day. Tanya Weinreis, who co-owns the Mountain Mudd Espresso coffee\nbusiness in Billings, Montana, along with her husband, got news about her SBA\nloan approval at noon on Friday.\n\nAD\n\nTwo hours later she signed the paperwork and walked out of Yellowstone Bank\nwith a check, she said, making hers the first business in the state to receive\nan SBA loan through the coronavirus stimulus bill.\n\n\u201cIt was the easiest loan I\u2019ve ever gotten in my life and I\u2019ve done a lot of\nloans,\u201d Weinreis said. It was six pages of paper, she said, and it didn\u2019t\nrequire a personal guarantee or collateral.\n\nThe loan kicked in at the right time, she said. She\u2019s only had to close two of\ntheir 11 locations and hasn\u2019t let any of her 50 employees go, even though she\nhad one day when \u201cwe sold $13 in coffee in a seven-hour shift.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business is still hearing more\ncomplaints from members than about firms getting funding, said Karen Harned,\nexecutive director of the the federation\u2019s Small Business Legal Center.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping each day gets better,\u201d Harned said.\n\nThe 30 million small businesses in the U.S. employ half of the private work\nforce, and many have been forced to close amid stay-at-home orders. Almost a\nquarter of firms have shut down temporarily, and one in 10 are less than one\nmonth away from permanently going out of business, according to a poll\nreleased April 3 by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe SBA said as of 4:30 p.m. New York Time on Tuesday, it has received more\nthan 275,000 applications valued at $75 billion since the program went into\noperation. That amount hasn\u2019t been given to firms yet, but represents the\nvalue of loans SBA has registered and guaranteed for lenders to complete the\nprocess and disburse funds, according to a senior administration official.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat would mean about 20% of the $349 billion appropriated for the program has\nalready been committed.\n\n\u2018Little Bit Spotty\u2019\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump has said that the rollout had only a few\n\u201cglitches,\u201d there have been widespread reports of problems, confusion and\ndelays. Lenders reported that E-Tran, the SBA system that lenders use to\nprocess loans, went down on Monday and has been overwhelmed.\n\nThe system was working Tuesday, but connecting with SBA was still \u201ca little\nbit spotty,\u201d said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.\n\nSome banks were accepting applications but not finalizing them because they\nlacked enough guidance from SBA and the Treasury about questions such as how\npayroll should be counted and how loans will be forgiven. The Trump\nadministration issued new guidance late Monday night that helped, Merski said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA major concern is that some small businesses, especially mom-and-pop\noperations, could get shut out. Borrowers also complained that they are being\nturned away from banks because they didn\u2019t have an existing lending\nrelationship with them.\n\nTravis Powell, owner of the Best Western Plus Frontier Motel in Lone Pine,\nCalifornia, said he\u2019s reached out to about 32 lenders since learning the two\nlocal banks he works with aren\u2019t participating in any SBA programs. None are\nhelping him, most because he doesn\u2019t bank with them, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty crushing,\u201d he said, adding that many of the business owners in\nthe 2,000-person town near Mount Whitney and Death Valley were in in the same\nboat. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait in line behind businesses that are in big cities and\nhave these established accounts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe rollout of the emergency loan program has been \u201cmessy, quite honestly,\u201d\nsaid Brooke Mirenda, who runs Sunshine State Economic Development Corp., a\nnot-for-profit SBA lender in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nAD\n\nJen McMurrough, owner of Little Dogs Resort in Salt Lake City, got her loan\nMonday, which she said \u201cgives me some breathing room.\u201d\n\nHer business does overnight boarding of pets and day care with grooming, but\ncustomers have been scarce because of the coronavirus, McMurrough said.\n\nThe loan \u201cmeans that I don\u2019t have to lay my workers off, it gives me critical\ncash flow that means I won\u2019t get behind on bills,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at\n[bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com)\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n0 Comments\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n### Coronavirus Updates\n\nFollow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

First of all, we want to\nclarify that our intent has always been to apply a drop in the salary that we\nreceive because we fully understand that this is an exceptional situation and\nwe are always the first to have helped the club when asked. Many times we have\neven done it on our own initiative, at other times that we thought [it was]\nnecessary or important.\n\n\u201cFor our part, the moment has arrived to announce that, aside from the 70%\nwage cut during the State of Emergency, we are going to also make\ncontributions so that all the club\u2019s employees can earn 100% of their salaries\nfor as long as this situation lasts.\u201d\n\nToday In: [SportsMoney](https://www.forbes.com/sportsmoney/Old)\n\n  * [\n\n### Canelo Alvarez Is Being Targeted By Yet Another Light Heavyweight Titlist\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2020/04/07/canelo-alvarez-is-\nbeing-targeted-by-yet-another-light-heavyweight-titlist/)\n\n  * [\n\n### F1 'Expected' To Drive Up Its Loans To Pay Teams\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2020/04/07/f1-expected-to-drive-up-its-\nloans-to-pay-teams/)\n\n  * [\n\n### The 10 Best Pound For Pound Fighters In Boxing: April 2020\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2020/04/07/the-10-best-pound-for-\npound-fighters-in-boxing-april-2020/)\n\nSo far Messi is the first elite athlete to use his global platform to speak up\nin support of a wage cut in order to ensure his club\u2019s employees can receive\nfull pay while unable to work due to the shutdown.\n\nThe Argentine winger earns $90 million annually in salary and partially\nguaranteed bonus before taxes, thanks to a contract extension he signed in\nNovember 2017 that commits him to Camp Nou through June 2021. For some\nperspective, even with this haircut, Messi\u2019s estimated $42 million annual\nsalary will still be greater than the total earnings (salary, bonus and\nendorsements) of all players in the world except his nemesis Cristiano Ronaldo\nand his former teammate Neymar, who is now at Paris Saint-Germain. With\nendorsements from the likes of long-term partners Adidas and Pepsi, the six-\ntime Ballon d\u2019Or winner could still earn an estimated $78 million annually,\ncompared with the $127 million he made on and off the pitch during the 2018-19\nseason.\n\nLast week, Messi donated $1.1 million to two hospitals fighting the\ncoronavirus: one in his native Rosario, Argentina, and one in Barcelona,\nSpain, the second-most-impacted European country with coronavirus cases.\n\nBarcelona, valued at $4 billion, is the [second-most-valuable club in\nsoccer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2019/05/29/the-worlds-most-\nvaluable-soccer-teams-2019/\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2019/05/29/the-worlds-most-valuable-\nsoccer-teams-2019/\") and the [fourth-most-valuable in all of\nsports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-\nworlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2019/\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-worlds-50-most-\nvaluable-sports-teams-2019/\"), and it supports the world\u2019s most expensive\nroster, averaging $12 million per player, according to [Sporting\nIntelligence](https://www.sportingintelligence.com/2019/12/23/ronaldos-\njuventus-leap-to-join-messis-barca-on-global-pay-podium-231219/\n\"https://www.sportingintelligence.com/2019/12/23/ronaldos-juventus-leap-to-\njoin-messis-barca-on-global-pay-podium-231219/\"). Such payrolls take their\ntoll. Before play was paused, the Catalan giant was already operating at a\nloss of $37 million, and of its $858 million in expenses, $600 million went to\nplayer wages.\n\nMessi\u2019s wage cut can more than cover that loss if play is suspended through\nJune. His announcement did not address the timing or length of the wage\nreductions.\n\nYesterday, Italian soccer club Juventus\n[announced](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2020/03/29/cristiano-\nronaldo-agrees-to-juventus-wage-cut-but-still-on-track-to-become-\nfirst-1-billion-footballer-this-season/\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2020/03/29/cristiano-ronaldo-\nagrees-to-juventus-wage-cut-but-still-on-track-to-become-first-1-billion-\nfootballer-this-season/\") that it had reached an\n[agreement](https://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2020/company-notice-2803.php\n\"https://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2020/company-notice-2803.php\") with its\nplayers and coaches to implement a wage cut while Serie A play is indefinitely\nshut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe club said it expects to save $100 million by reducing compensation over\nfour months, March to June. But it further explained it will pay normal\nsalaries when Serie A resumes play.\n\nThe amount shaved is equivalent to 30% of the Bianconeri\u2019s annual total wage\nbill, the highest payroll among Serie A clubs, per [Sporting\nIntelligence](https://www.sportingintelligence.com/2019/12/23/ronaldos-\njuventus-leap-to-join-messis-barca-on-global-pay-podium-231219/\n\"https://www.sportingintelligence.com/2019/12/23/ronaldos-juventus-leap-to-\njoin-messis-barca-on-global-pay-podium-231219/\").

Contrary to previous circulated reports, _Forbes_\nconfirmed with his representatives that the 35-year-old father of five did not\nbuy an island where his family could self-isolate until it was safe to return\nto Italy, or offer up his namesake hotels in Portugal to be used as hospitals.\n\nAccording to _L\u2019Equipe_ , Neymar\u2019s club, Paris Saint-Germain, has yet to make\na decision on wage cuts, but other French Ligue 1 clubs are in the process. He\nis currently the third-highest-paid footballer in the world, having earned\n$103 million last year, including $75 million in salary and bonus.\n\nBarcelona and Juventus are the latest among many European clubs, including\nGerman Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, to institute\nwage cuts while play is suspended.

I failed at that, and softball, basketball, volleyball, track, ice\nskating and cheerleading in the process. Looking back, the only thing amazing\nabout my persistent pursuit of sporting glory was my lack of self-awareness. I\nonly ever made a team after my second time trying out, when I showed up the\nnext year with my much more athletic younger sister. (True story: she played\nas my proxy on Forbes' softball team one season.)

Now after studying business at Drexel University and\njournalism at NYU, I compete for bylines, primarily writing about the business\nof sports. As for my sporting endeavor, I decided to focus on the one where I\nonly compete with myself: running.

It's such an important part of\nwhat England transports around the world, billions of people watch it.\n\n'There was a really strong chance that if football set the tone then everybody\nelse would follow and do the right things.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Ian Wright tweeted to commend the club, saying: 'Never\ntoo late to do the right thing.'\n\nAnd ex-Southampton star Matt Le Tissier also weighed into the debate,\napplauding Liverpool fans and ex-players for forcing the club's hand.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/22/26884746-8193295-image-a-2_1586207818551.jpg)\n\nHe tweeted: 'Well done all the ex Liverpool players and their own fans whose\nreaction has led to an about turn from LFC on furloughing.'\n\nThe Anfield club announced on Saturday they intended to take advantage of the\nCoronavirus Job retention scheme introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, with\nmore than half of their non-playing staff being furloughed.

The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will last for\nat least three months from March 1.\n\n'We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week to announce that we\nintended to apply to the Coronavirus Retention Scheme and furlough staff due\nto the suspension of the Premier League football calendar and are truly sorry\nfor that.'\n\nThis is not the first time FSG \u2013 whose key figures are principal owner John W\nHenry, Chairman Tom Werner and President Mike Gordon \u2013 have reversed a\ncontroversial decision. In February 2016, they abandoned plans to introduce\ntickets for \u00a377 following a mass walkout at Anfield.\n\nFSG are conscious of the way they are publicly perceived and were left in no\nuncertain terms that accepting state intervention was not a good look for a\ncompany whose turnover was \u00a3533million in the last financial year. The\nChampions League winners made a profit of \u00a342million.\n\nSome of those staff who were initially furloughed will now return to their\npositions \u2013 it is up to heads of department to decide how the workforce is\ndistributed \u2013 but Moore warned that Liverpool will face more turbulent times\nthe longer they are not playing football.\n\n![The initial decision undid all the good work Jurgen Klopp's side have\nproduced this\nseason](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![The initial decision undid all the good work Jurgen Klopp's side have\nproduced this\nseason](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/20/26878736-8193295-The_initial_decision_undid_all_the_good_work_Jurgen_Klopp_s_side-a-2_1586286568850.jpg)\n\nThe initial decision undid all the good work Jurgen Klopp's side have produced\nthis season\n\nMoore said: 'In the spirit of transparency, we must be clear \u2013 despite the\nfact we were in a healthy position prior to this crisis \u2013 our revenues have\nbeen shut off yet our outgoings remain.

All\nother worries should be placed in that context first.\n\nAllowing for perspective in these unprecedented and harrowing times, it is\nimportant to address an issue we, as an organisation, have been involved in\nsince the weekend.\n\nWe have consulted with a range of key stakeholders as part of a process aimed\nat achieving the best possible outcome for all concerned. A range of possible\nscenarios were considered, including but not restricted to: applying to the\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme which pays 80% of salary and guaranteeing the\n20% payment; applying to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme with a guarantee\nto reimburse monies received at a later date and, thirdly, finding an\nalternative means to cover our furlough costs.\n\nIt is as a direct result of this extensive consultation and our own internal\ndeliberations at various levels throughout the Club that we have opted to find\nalternative means despite our eligibility to apply for the Coronavirus Job\nRetention Scheme.\n\nWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week to announce that we\nintended to apply to the Coronavirus Retention Scheme and furlough staff due\nto the suspension of the Premier League football calendar, and are truly sorry\nfor that.\n\nOur intentions were, and still are, to ensure the entire workforce is given as\nmuch protection as possible from redundancy and/or loss of earnings during\nthis unprecedented period.\n\nWe are therefore committed to finding alternative ways to operate while there\nare no football matches being played that ensures we are not applying for the\ngovernment relief scheme.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the great army of staff and casual workers who\nwork tirelessly to ensure Liverpool is a club that operates to the highest of\nstandards.\n\nBut in the spirit of transparency we must also be clear, despite the fact we\nwere in a healthy position prior to this crisis, our revenues have been shut\noff yet our outgoings remain. And like almost every sector of society, there\nis great uncertainty and concern over our present and future.\n\nLike any responsible employer concerned for its workers in the current\nsituation, the Club continues to prepare for a range of different scenarios,\naround when football can return to operating as it did before the pandemic.\nThese scenarios range from best case to worst and everything in between.\n\nIt is an unavoidable truth that several of these scenarios involve a massive\ndownturn in revenue, with correspondingly unprecedented operating losses.\nHaving these vital financial resources so profoundly impacted would obviously\nnegatively affect our ability to operate as we previously have.\n\nWe are engaged in the process of exploring all avenues within our scope to\nlimit the inevitable damage. We thank the many amazing people in our club, at\nall levels, who are committed to helping us do just that, despite the\ncomplexity and unpredictability in the world and our industry.\n\nWe would also like to take the opportunity to thank those who have engaged\nwith us in a productive fashion, none more so than our supporters, their\nrepresentatives, particularly Spirit of Shankly, the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe\nAnderson, Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram, local MPs Dan Carden and Ian Byrne and\nmany other individuals who we have had much valued dialogue with.\n\nStay Safe\n\n## RELATED ARTICLES\n\n  * Previous\n  * 1\n  * Next\n\n  * [ ![](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/15/26867572-0-image-m-20_1586182100172.jpg) Liverpool 'REFUSE to refund Atletico Madrid fans who stayed... ](/sport/football/article-8192253/Liverpool-REFUSE-refund-Atletico-fans-did-not-travel-Anfield-visitors-paying-15k.html) [ ![](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/10/26860032-0-image-m-16_1586166122539.jpg) 'Scrap it and start again': Manchester United defender Luke... ](/sport/football/article-8191345/Luke-Shaw-calls-Premier-League-season-declared-void-games-played-soon.html) [ ![](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/14/26865990-0-image-m-47_1586178985147.jpg) 'Kenny Dalglish will be disgusted... it's totally against... ](/sport/football/article-8192035/Liverpool-decision-furlough-staff-disgust-Kenny-Dalglish-claims-Danny-Murphy.html) [ ![](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/14/26858272-0-image-m-48_1586178532062.jpg) Fenway Sports Group are worth \u00a35BILLION and own Liverpool... ](/sport/football/article-8191301/Liverpool-owners-worth-5BILLION-did-furlough-staff.html)\n\n## Share this article\n\nShare\n\n778 shares\n\n### Share or comment on this article:\n\n# Coronavirus: Carragher welcomes U-turn after Liverpool decide not to\nfurlough staff\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * [ e-mail ](mailto:?subject=Read this: 'I was angry and embarrassed as a Liverpool fan...

The why behind the answer is very powerful and could bring\ncomfort in these difficult times. As markets normalize in the future, sticking\nwith your 401(k) contributions now could be the most critical decision you\nmake on your journey to retirement.\n\n**It Seems Logical**\n\nWhen retirement account balances decline and the bears run rampant in the\nmarket, it is logical to question whether you are making the right decisions\nwith your money. As a result, a common consideration is to stop your payroll\ndeductions to your 401(k) plan. It is easy to feel you are throwing good money\nafter bad, flushing money down the proverbial toilet by making 401(k)\ncontributions when the market is down. Or, some might find it more productive\nto light their money on fire. None of these are good feelings, especially if\nthis is the first time you are experiencing a significant decline in the\nmarket. However, so long as you are still receiving a paycheck and are not in\nfinancial distress, don't stop your 401(k) contributions.\n\n**A Few Thoughts About The Markets**\n\nOn a day to day basis, the financial markets move up and down. Sometimes the\nshort term trend is more down than up as we have seen recently. While declines\nof more than 20% in stocks happen, it is not very often. Since 1928, the S&P\n500, a broad measure of the stock market, has finished a year with a 20% loss\nor more only seven times. Smaller market fluctuations are more frequent and\nexpected. The good news is that the stock market has also recovered after\nthese downturns.\n\nToday In: [Retirement](https://www.forbes.com/retirement)\n\n  * [\n\n### How Much Money Is Enough In Retirement?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robpascale/2020/04/07/how-much-money-is-enough-\nin-retirement/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Proactive Planning In Volatile Markets With Roth Conversions\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halseyschreier/2020/04/07/proactive-planning-\nin-volatile-markets-with-roth-conversions/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Does Multi-Employer Pension Reform Belong In A \u2018Phase Four\u2019 Coronavirus\nBill?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebauer/2020/04/07/does-multi-employer-pension-\nreform-belong-in-a-phase-four-coronavirus-bill/)\n\n![Frequency of stock market downturns and typical recovery\ntime.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e767c93d8e1ae0007b721c3/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nFrequency of Stock Market Downturns\n\nLockton Retirement Services\n\nAnother way to rationalize this is by looking at periods of rolling returns.\nIn a given year, the market can be very volatile. The S&P 500 has gained as\nmuch as 53% and lost as much as 43% in a single year. As you extend the amount\nof time you stay invested in the market, the range of returns tightens and\nskews more positive. Your probability of a better investment outcome also\nincreases if you diversify your investments between stocks and bonds.\n\n![Market range of returns chart with different rolling returns over one,\nthree, five and ten year periods for stocks, bonds, and balanced portfolios.\n](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e76436961bd580006f8cccd/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nRange of Returns Chart\n\nLockton Retirement Services\n\nIn the short term, no one knows where the market will finish on a daily,\nmonthly, or yearly basis. This unpredictability and volatility can be\nmaddening. However, if you are making consistent payroll contributions to your\n401(k) plan, it can actually work in your favor. It may actually improve the\nlong term growth of your retirement savings.\n\n**Dollar-Cost Averaging**\n\nA key advantage of 401(k) plans is hiding in plain sight. The simple process\nof making a contribution every paycheck means you are buying into the markets\nat different prices throughout the year. Sometimes the markets increase in\nvalue, sometimes they decrease, every now and again they are virtually the\nsame between your contributions. As your payroll deductions are invested at\ndifferent prices, your actual investment cost basis becomes the average of the\npurchase prices from one payroll period to the next. Counterintuitively,\nduring times of market volatility, this works to your advantage. To\nillustrate, let's take a look at Consistent Courtney and her last ten\ncontributions to her 401(k) plan.\n\n![How dollar-cost averaging can help long term returns in a declining market.\n](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e779b7bc7b02d000666d978/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\n401(k) Payroll Deductions In A Declining Market\n\nRick Unser\n\nAt the end of these ten contributions, Courtney does not feel great about how\nthings have gone. She has several concerns about continuing her contributions:\n\n  * In paycheck #1, her first contribution was made at a price of $10 \n  * Her investment went as low as $7 in paycheck #6, a 30% decline from where she started\n  * At paycheck #10 it stood at $8, a 20% decline from where she started\n\nAt first glance, at the end of these ten contribution periods, it looks like\nshe has a 20% loss from where she began. However, despite the decline in her\ninvestment, she is actually at the breakeven point on her contributions.\nCourtney, who is now understandably confused, needs some more information to\nsupport this claim.\n\n![Example of how dollar-cost averaging in a 401\\(k\\) plan can provide a lower\naverage purchase price for an investment.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e779ec0d8e1ae0007b73026/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nExample of dollar-cost averaging\n\nRick Unser\n\nThanks to her consistent contribution of $100 a paycheck into her 401(k) plan,\nas the value of her investment declined, she was able to purchase more shares.\nIn total, Courtney contributed $1,000 to her 401(k) plan, and at the end of\nthis period, she owns 125 shares valued at $8 a share and they are worth\n$1,000. By using the concept of dollar-cost averaging, Courtney's average cost\non her investments was lowered and improved her rate of return. Taking this\none step further, if her investment appreciates back to where she started at\n$10 a share, she will have a 25% gain on her contributions. After learning\nabout dollar-cost averaging and how it can help during volatile markets,\nCourtney decided to keep her 401(k) contributions flowing.\n\n**Light A Match**\n\nIt is easy to make poor financial decisions that feel good at the moment but\ncan hurt you in the future. One more concept to keep in mind, many employers\nmatch some or all of your 401(k) contributions. If you decide to stop your\n401(k) deductions, the company match ends as well. Short term volatility in\nthe financial markets is challenging for anyone to stomach. The long-term\ntrends of the stock market and the hidden power of dollar-cost averaging are\ntwo compelling reasons to keep your 401(k) contributions going.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/401kfridays).

then\nrecovered, following allegations that it inflated 2019 revenue and user\nnumbers.\n\nStock in the video-streaming platform iQIYI dropped sharply, but then\nrecovered, following allegations that it inflated 2019 revenue and user\nnumbers.\n\nStock in the video-streaming platform iQIYI, often called the Netflix of\nChina, dropped sharply, but then recovered on Tuesday, following allegations\nby a research firm\u2014backed by the short seller Muddy Waters Capital\u2014that it\ninflated 2019 revenue and user numbers.\n\nIn a report released Tuesday morning, the firm Wolfpack Research claims that\niQIYI (ticker: IQ)was committing fraud well before its initial public offering\nin 2018 and has continued to do so. \u201cLike so many other China-based companies\nwho IPO with inflated numbers, [iQIYI] is unable to legitimately grow their\nbusiness enough to true up their financial statements,\u201d the firm wrote.\n\niQIYI said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon that Wolfpack Research\u2019s\nreport contains \u201cnumerous errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading\nconclusions and interpretations.\u201d The company said it remains committed to\nhigh standards of corporate governance and internal controls.\n\nThe report came as China\u2019s Luckin Coffee (LK) recently announced an internal\nprobe into alleged fraud by one of its executives, news that caused the stock\nto shed nearly 80% of its value last Thursday. Trading in Luckin shares was\nhalted on Tuesday.\n\nWolfpack Research was launched last year by veteran activist short seller Dan\nDavid, mainly focusing on exposing fraud and corporate wrongdoing at public\ncompanies around the globe.\n\nMuddy Waters Capital, the activist investment firm that exposed the alleged\nfraud at Luckin in January, has made an initial investment in Wolfpack. Muddy\nWaters said on Tuesday that it helped Wolfpack prepare the report and that it\nhas taken a short position in iQIYI\u2014a bet that the price will decline.\n\nShares of iQIYI tumbled 11.2% Tuesday morning before bouncing back to gain\n3.2% as of the close. The Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU), which owns roughly\nhalf of iQIYI, saw its stock dip 1.1%.\n\nWolfpack estimates that iQIYI inflated its 2019 revenue by approximately 8\nbillion to 13 billion Chinese yuan ($1.14 billion to $1.85 billion), or 27% to\n44%, relative to the actual levels. iQIYI is overstating its user numbers by\napproximately 42% to 60%, says Wolfpack, and also has inflated its\nexpenses\u2014the prices it pays for content, other assets, and acquisitions\u2014in\norder to \u201cburn off fake cash to hide the fraud from its auditor and\ninvestors.\u201d\n\nIn a 37-page report, Wolfpack Research said it conducted in-person surveys of\n1,563 people within iQIYI\u2019s target demographic in China and that 548 of them\nwere effective paying subscribers to the company\u2019s VIP memberships. Among\nthose, approximately one third obtained their VIP memberships through iQIYI\npartners such as JD.com, Xiaomi TV, and Ctrip\u2014often nearly free through \u201cbuy\none, get one\u201d or \u201cmembership benefit\u201d deals, as a result of using the other\nservices, it said.\n\nIQIYI records the full revenue for those memberships, but lists its partners\u2019\nshare of that claimed income as an expense, according to the Wolfpack report.\nThe result is that it can simultaneously inflate its revenues and burn off\nfake cash, the report said.\n\nWolfpack said iQIYI\u2019s deferred revenues\u2014prepaid by subscription customers for\nmembership services\u2014reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its\nIPO prospectus were inflated by 261.7%, 165.5%, and 86.2% for 2015, 2016, and\n2017, respectively. The post-IPO revenues continue to be overstated as well,\nWolfpack said.\n\nThe report also accused iQIYI of inflating the value of the content it\nprovides through its streaming service, a figure that is usually determined\ninternally. \u201cIn other words, [iQIYI]\u2019s management can effectively assign any\nvalue they want to these transactions, providing an easy opportunity to\ninflate its revenues,\u201d Wolfpack wrote.\n\niQIYI hasn\u2019t made a profit since its foundation 10 years ago, according to\nWolfpack. The company lost 10.3 billion yuan in 2019, 9.1 billion yuan in\n2018, and 3.7 billion yuan in 2017, according to FactSet data.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the\nauthor and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\n###  Trending Topics\n\n  * [ Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets \"Markets\")\n  * [ US Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/us-markets \"US Markets\")\n  * [ Stocks  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/stocks \"Stocks\")\n  * [ Personal Finance  ](/topic/personal-finance \"Personal Finance\")\n\n###  Trending Articles\n\n  * [ 3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash  Mar 15, 2020 ](/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-in-the-coronavirus-fueled-market-crash-2020-03-15 \"3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash\")\n  * [ How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work  Mar 30, 2020 ](/articles/how-expanded-coronavirus-unemployment-benefits-work-2020-03-30 \"How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work\")\n  * [ 3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020  Jan 17, 2020 ](/articles/3-strong-buy-stocks-for-the-5g-revolution-in-2020-2020-01-17 \"3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020\")\n  * [ The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020  Jan 22, 2020 ](/articles/the-5-largest-economies-in-the-world-and-their-growth-in-2020-2020-01-22 \"The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020\")\n\n##  Latest Stocks Videos\n\nNow Playing\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nWhere Can Investors Find Value in the Second Quarter?

The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will last for\nat least three months from March 1.\n\nEven current players appear to have been left uncomfortable with the club's\ndecision to use money from the state to pay non-playing staff.\n\nDefender Jan Vertonghen was reported to have given a glimpse into the players'\nviews on the matter when he liked a tweet explaining that Liverpool had\nreversed their decision to furlough non-playing staff. As of Monday morning,\nhe had unliked the tweet.\n\nAs it stands, Spurs are paying their players full wages, while the club's 550\nnon-playing staff have been furloughed and have lost 20 per cent of their\nincome.\n\nUpon making the announcement, Levy explained why the club needed to introduce\nsuch drastic measures. In short - to save jobs.\n\n'Having already taken steps to reduce costs, we ourselves made the difficult\ndecision \u2013 in order to protect jobs \u2013 to reduce the remuneration of all 550\nnon-playing directors and employees for April and May by 20 per cent\nutilising, where appropriate, the Government\u2019s furlough scheme,' [the\nstatement read](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2020/march/message-from-\nthe-chairman/). 'We shall continue to review this position.'\n\nA forensic analysis of the club's revenue highlights that they have made a\nsubstantial profit every season since 2012. No club from the traditional 'Big\nSix' has seen their revenue grow as much as Tottenham since 2016, up 120 per\ncent in four years to \u00a3251m.\n\nLast year alone, the club made a profit of \u00a369m, fuelling the criticism that\nthey need a government bail-out to pay non-playing staff.\n\n![Liverpool owner John W Henry \\(right\\) reversed his decision to furlough and\npressure is building on Levy \\(left\\) and Tottenham to follow suit given the\nwealth that they\npossess](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Liverpool owner John W Henry \\(right\\) reversed his decision to furlough and\npressure is building on Levy \\(left\\) and Tottenham to follow suit given the\nwealth that they\npossess](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/11/26905006-8195449-image-a-44_1586253988726.jpg)\n\nLiverpool owner John W Henry (right) reversed his decision to furlough and\npressure is building on Levy (left) and Tottenham to follow suit given the\nwealth that they possess\n\n![Tottenham's official supporters' group have urged the club to rethink their\ndamaging\ndecision](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Tottenham's official supporters' group have urged the club to rethink their\ndamaging\ndecision](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/08/26899760-8195093-image-a-2_1586244335217.jpg)\n\nTottenham's official supporters' group have urged the club to rethink their\ndamaging decision\n\n![Former Tottenham defender Ramon Vega also hit out at the club for\nfurloughing\nstaff](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Former Tottenham defender Ramon Vega also hit out at the club for\nfurloughing\nstaff](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/12/26906914-8195449-image-a-11_1586257326091.jpg)\n\nFormer Tottenham defender Ramon Vega also hit out at the club for furloughing\nstaff\n\n![Former player-turned-broadcaster Stan Collymore has been a vocal critic of\nthe\nclubs](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Former player-turned-broadcaster Stan Collymore has been a vocal critic of\nthe\nclubs](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/12/26907388-8195449-image-a-12_1586258159467.jpg)\n\nFormer player-turned-broadcaster Stan Collymore has been a vocal critic of the\nclubs\n\nA [study by Swiss\nRamble](https://twitter.com/SwissRamble/status/1245594352212004864), assessing\nthe club's profit and loss before taxation, highlighted that Spurs have been\nprofitable for seven consecutive seasons.\n\nIn that period, chairman Daniel Levy has overseen the club make a healthy\n\u00a3412m, working out at an average of \u00a359m per year.\n\nIn the last two years alone, the north London side made \u00a3226m in profit. It\nhas been eight years since Spurs posted a loss - that was a deficit of \u00a37m\nback in 2012.\n\nThe study goes on to reveal that overall the club's revenue has rocketed by a\nquarter of a billion pounds in three years, from \u00a3210m to \u00a3461m.\n\nPart of that is due to improvement on the pitch, domestically and in Europe,\nbut the figure includes a rise in broadcasting funds and growth in both\ncommercial and matchday income.\n\nSpurs' average player salary is \u00a376,000-a-week while the net worth - his\nassets minus what he owes in liabilities - of owner Joe Lewis is reported to\nbe \u00a34.3bn.\n\nAll of this has ramped up pressure on Levy and the rest of the club's power\nbrokers to follow Liverpool in reversing their decision to furlough non-\nplaying staff, given the significant wealth reserves the club has to fulfil\nsalaries without state intervention.\n\n![Match of the Day host and former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker has\ncriticised the club\nmove](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Match of the Day host and former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker has\ncriticised the club\nmove](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/07/11/26905142-8195449-image-a-45_1586253999506.jpg)\n\nMatch of the Day host and former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker has criticised\nthe club move\n\n[](/sport/teampages/liverpool.html)The Reds dramatically reversed their\ndecision to accept government funding on Monday after chief executive Peter\nMoore admitted: 'we came to the wrong conclusion.'\n\nThe Anfield club announced on Saturday they intended to take advantage of the\nCoronavirus Job retention scheme introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, with\nmore than half of their [non-playing staff being\nfurloughed](/sport/sportsnews/article-8187475/Liverpool-reveal-placed-staff-\nfurlough-insist-employees-paid.html).

NVR, the parent\ncompany of Ryan Homes, saw its shares drop by 29.9%, while shares of D.R.\nHorton, the largest homebuilder in the U.S. by number of units sold, fell\n36.2%. Meritage's stock was the worst performer of the three, falling 42.5%\nfor the month.\n\nThese performances, while much worse than the **S &P 500**'s drop of just\n12.5%, were par for the course for the homebuilding sector. The **S &P\nHomebuilders Select Industry Index **dropped 38.4% for the month. All three\nhave rebounded along with the broader stock market so far in April, but are\nstill down between 25% and 35% for the year.\n\n![A wood frame home, under\nconstruction.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F567203%2Fgetty-\nhome-under-construction.jpg&w=700)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n## So what\n\nLike many stocks across many sectors, shares of homebuilders began a serious\nslide on March 10, as worries about the coronavirus' effect on the U.S.\neconomy grew more pronounced. The fears came in spite of positive news from\nthe real estate sector.\n\nJanuary and February had been banner months for the industry. That's unusual,\nsince home sales tend to slow down in the winter months. But a number of\ncompanies posted better-than-expected sales numbers as a result of relatively\nwarm weather. Mortgage rates had been steadily moving lower, sparking interest\nfrom potential first-time buyers.\n\nBut after the stock market's big sell-offs during the second week in March,\nboth [buyers and sellers were starting to get\nnervous](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/31/3-red-flags-for-real-\nestate-\ninvestors.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=0218efea-f022-461b-bbc3-51782c84e818).\nA study by the National Association of Realtors showed that more than one-\nthird of Realtors surveyed reported sellers considering pulling their homes\noff the market, and nearly half reported a decrease in interest among buyers.\n\nThat's hardly surprising. When the **Dow Jones Industrial Average**\nexperiences its worst one-day point drop in history, potential buyers are\ngoing to worry about the impact on their savings. When layoffs start\nhappening, as they did in March, those affected are going to put their big-\nticket purchases on hold. Sellers know this, and also know that if demand\ndries up, they won't be able to get as much for their home as they planned,\nwhich is why they may consider pulling it off the market. Wall Street also\nknows this, and dumped shares of residential homebuilders -- which, of course,\ncan't just pull their homes off the market and wait.\n\nAnother problem for homebuilders like NVR is that although the process of\nbuying and selling a home can be partly done remotely (in fact, the entire\nthing could conceivably occur online and through the mail), it is usually\nhandled in person. Real estate agents meet with clients to talk through their\nneeds and to show them properties. Prospective buyers walk through model homes\nor homes for sale. Many buyers want to talk to potential neighbors, or walk\naround the block a bit.\n\nBut the number of Americans under stay-at-home orders from their state\ngovernments steadily increased throughout the month of March. By March 31,\nmore than two-thirds of all Americans were being told to stay inside. That\nnumber has since increased to more than 90%. That doesn't bode well for the\nall-important spring buying season.\n\nBeyond touting virtual tours of their available home options on their websites\nand offering to set up remote meetings with prospective buyers, there was\nlittle the industry could do to keep things moving.\n\n## Now what\n\nThe handful of homebuilders that have reported earnings for January and\nFebruary posted impressive numbers, as you might expect. But they also\nindicated in their comments that March was likely to be brutal, and that they\nhad no idea what to expect for the rest of the year. A lot depends now on how\nquickly things get back to normal.\n\nThat, in turn, is going to depend on [how soon the coronavirus pandemic\npeaks](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/30/will-the-coronavirus-\ndemolish-these-homebuilder-\nst.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=0218efea-f022-461b-bbc3-51782c84e818)\nand then recedes, whether an effective treatment becomes available, whether\nthere's a second wave of infections, and how soon a vaccine can be developed.\nRight now, nobody knows the answers to these questions. And until there's more\nclarity, investors may want to stay away from not just NVR, D.R. Horton, and\nMeritage Homes, but this entire sector as well. A better bet would be to focus\non [stocks that have clearer pathways to\noutperformance](https://www.fool.com/investing/top-stocks-to-\nbuy.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=0218efea-f022-461b-bbc3-51782c84e818).\n\n**10 stocks we like better than D.R.

The Kuala\nLumpur Composite Index now rests just beneath the 1,370-point plateau although\nit may run out of steam on Wednesday.\n\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is soft thanks to plummeting crude\noil prices, while profit taking is also likely on the docket. The European\nmarkets were up and the U.S. bourses were down and the Asian markets are\npredicted to follow the latter lead.\n\nThe KLCI finished sharply higher on Tuesday following gains from the financial\nshares, plantation stocks and telecoms.\n\nFor the day, the index spiked 28.23 points or 2.10 percent to finish at the\ndaily high of 1,369.92 after moving as low as 1,352.63. Volume was 6.547\nbillion shares worth 3.355 billion ringgit. There were 900 gainers and 134\ndecliners.\n\nAmong the actives, Sime Darby Plantations skyrocketed 8.60 percent, while\nPress Metal surged 6.81 percent, Axiata soared 5.79 percent, Genting Malaysia\nspiked 4.81 percent, Sime Darby accelerated 3.30 percent, Dialog Group jumped\n3.24 percent, Kuala Lumpur Kepong climbed 2.90 percent, Maybank gathered 2.35\npercent, IHH Healthcare perked 1.79 percent, CIMB Group collected 1.71\npercent, Hartalega Holdings advanced 1.56 percent, IOI Corporation added 1.55\npercent, RHB Capital lost 1.29 percent, Digi.com and Top Glove both gained\n0.94 percent, Tenaga Nasional rose 0.83 percent, MISC was up 0.53 percent and\nPublic Bank and Petronas Chemicals were unchanged.\n\nThe lead from Wall Street is slightly soft as stocks opened sharply higher on\nTuesday but faded as the day progressed, sending the major averages slightly\ninto the red.\n\nThe Dow eased 26.13 points or 0.12 percent to finish at 22,653.86, while the\nNASDAQ lost 25.98 points or 0.33 percent to 7,887.26 and the S&P 500 fell 4.27\npoints or 0.16 percent to end at 2,659.41.\n\nThe initial strength on Wall Street came as traders reacted to recent signs\nthat the spread of the coronavirus is slowing in hot spots such as New York.\n\nBut buying interest waned shortly after the start of trading, however, with\ntraders taking profits after seeing Monday's strong rally as overdone.\n\nCrude oil futures ended sharply lower Tuesday after the Energy Information\nAdministration lowered its forecast for crude oil prices for the year. West\nTexas Intermediate Crude oil futures for May ended down $2.45 or 9.4 percent\nat $23.63 a barrel.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the\nauthor and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\n###  Trending Topics\n\n  * [ Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets \"Markets\")\n  * [ US Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/us-markets \"US Markets\")\n  * [ Stocks  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/stocks \"Stocks\")\n  * [ Personal Finance  ](/topic/personal-finance \"Personal Finance\")\n\n###  Trending Articles\n\n  * [ 3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash  Mar 15, 2020 ](/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-in-the-coronavirus-fueled-market-crash-2020-03-15 \"3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash\")\n  * [ How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work  Mar 30, 2020 ](/articles/how-expanded-coronavirus-unemployment-benefits-work-2020-03-30 \"How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work\")\n  * [ 3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020  Jan 17, 2020 ](/articles/3-strong-buy-stocks-for-the-5g-revolution-in-2020-2020-01-17 \"3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020\")\n  * [ The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020  Jan 22, 2020 ](/articles/the-5-largest-economies-in-the-world-and-their-growth-in-2020-2020-01-22 \"The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020\")\n\n##  Latest Markets Videos\n\nNow Playing\n\n#TradeTalks: Despite Market Volatility, TD Ameritrade Clients Were Net Buyers\nin March 11 hours ago\n\nNow Playing\n\n#TradeTalks: TD Ameritrade's Sr. Strategist Institutional Trading Education\nDiscusses Volatility 12 hours ago\n\nNow Playing\n\n#TradeTalks: Are We Seeing a More Clear Timeline to Return to Normalcy?

[+] during Photo Day at FITTEAM Ballpark of The\nPalm Beaches on February 18, 2020 in West Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by\nMichael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nBaseball trades are best evaluated a few years after they take place. That is\nespecially true if prospect players are involved and change teams. From time\nto time, this writer will look back on baseball trades from several years ago\nto take stock of the results.\n\nIn today\u2019s game, young and untested prospect position players and pitchers are\nvalued by baseball teams. They bring club contract control as well as a\nreasonable, non-inflated salaries.\n\nGiven the elimination of the baseball season for the foreseeable future,\nrevenue for baseball clubs, or the lack thereof, will be a greater and greater\nconcern for team owners. Payroll control will become even more important,\nenhancing the already profound value of prospects.\n\nA trade from August 1, 2016 jumps out as very one-sided. That was the date it\nwas announced that pitcher Josh Fields had been traded from the Houston Astros\nto the Los Angeles Dodgers. Fields was 30 at the time. He had thrown 15.2\ninnings that year for the Astros, all in relief. He left Houston with an ERA\nof 6.89 and a WHIP of 1.66 at the time of the trade. Fields had yielded 23\nhits in those 15.2 innings. More about Fields later.\n\nThe return to Houston for Josh Fields was outfielder/first baseman Yordan\nAlvarez. Alvarez was signed by the Dodgers out of Cuba. The remarkable part of\nthe Alvarez signing was the battle the Dodgers and Astros fought during the\nrun-up to the 2015-16 international signing period. Both teams made extensive\nefforts to sign Alvarez. The Dodgers ultimately signed him, spending $2M for\nhis signature on a contract. Incidentally, the Dodgers paid a stiff penalty\nfor exceeding the signing value for the deal.\n\nOnly 45 days after they signed Alvarez, the Dodgers traded him to Houston for\nFields. Alvarez never played a game in the Dodgers organization.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s estimation, that trade was among the most lopsided and\nunusual transactions in quite some time. Now, several years after the trade,\nAlvarez is an important and impactful power hitting component of the winning\nHouston Astros.\n\nFields is out of baseball, having been released by the Dodgers in March of\n2019, signed as free agent by the Milwaukee Brewers in April of 2019, released\nby the Brewers in April of the same year and then signed by the Texas Rangers\nin May. The Rangers released Fields in June 2019. He has not signed anywhere\nsince.\n\nThe baseball world knew of Alvarez\u2019 potential when the bidding war between the\nDodgers and Astros took place. Basically, Alvarez was a Cuban player with\nunlimited power potential carrying very raw skills that would need refinement\nand repetition. He had shown a very sweet swing and excellent bat control\nwhile playing for Las Tunas in the Cuban Serie National, the best baseball\nleague in Cuba.\n\nEarly scouting reports listed Alvarez as muscular with a a chance to develop\neven greater muscle mass. In his early years stateside, he weighed 225 pounds\non his 6-5 frame, but his core and his legs were strong and powerful. He was\nonly 20 in 2017 when he hit .360/9/33 in 139 plate appearances at the Astros\nQuad City affiliate in the Class-A Midwest League. In that same age 20 year,\nAlvarez was promoted to Class-A Advanced Bules Creek, where he hit .277 with\nthree home runs and 36 RBIs.\n\nThis old scout watched Alvarez in the 2017 All Star Futures Game when he\nplayed for the World Team. He got a single, walked, drove in a run and scored\na run.\n\nLater that same season, Alvarez offered this scout additional opportunities to\nsee him play in the Arizona Fall League. He hit .313 with no home runs and\nonly one RBI for Mesa. But he was a large presence on the field. Undisciplined\nat the plate at the time, his hitting mechanics were overly aggressive,\nresulting in six strikeouts in 17 plate appearances. Frankly, it appeared to\nthis observer that Alvarez was more of an afterthought than a premiere\npriority prospect. His performance was lackluster and unimpressive.\n\nAlvarez spent the next season, 2018, at Double-A Corpus Christi and Triple-A\nFresno. Granted, those are hitter-friendly environments, but he combined to\nhit .293 with 20 home runs and 74 RBIs. The big man also stole six bases in\neight attempts, showing an impressive quickness for his size.\n\nA grade 60 player has All Star qualities. He is an impact player with several\nwell above average skills and tools. Why is Yordan Alvarez a grade 60 player?\n\nAlvarez kept improving with repetition and experience, making it to the parent\nHouston Astros midway in the 2019 season. It is this past season that has\nplaced him on the map of top-notch major league power hitters. He was promoted\nafter hitting 23 homers and driving in 71 runs at Triple-A Round Rock.\n\nAfter hitting those 23 Triple-A home runs, Alvarez hit another 27 homers in\nonly 3 1/2 months after graduating to the big leagues. He finished his season\nhitting .313 and driving in 78 runs in only 369 plate major league\nappearances. He did strike out 94 times, a fact of life for sluggers in\ntoday\u2019s game.\n\nAlvarez\u2019 performance last year was similar to that of Hall of Famer Willie\nMcCovey, who in 1959 hit 29 home runs for Triple-A Phoenix and another 13 for\nhis major league club, the San Francisco Giants. The late McCovey\u2019s career\ntook off from there. That can certainly happen to Yordan Alvarez.\n\nAlvarez\u2019s hitting style is best suited to hit for average than strictly for\nhome run power. He has lost some of the aggressiveness he brought with him to\nthe Fall League in favor of a more measured, barrel seeking approach. He sees\nthe ball well out of the hand of the pitcher and can time and adjust to\nbreaking balls with an advanced approach. Basically, Alvarez is more a line-\ndrive hitter than a fence-busting slugger. However, he gets his share of home\nruns, and then some. The ball jumps off his bat and gets to the landing place\nwith outstanding exit velocity.\n\nAlvarez has hands quick and explosive enough to find and connect with high\nfastballs and inside pitches. He knows how to get the most from his hips and\ntrunk in his swing.\n\nEven given his long and angular frame, Alvarez is a very good runner. His\ninstincts are outstanding, and he continues to steal bases and take an extra\nbase with his long strides and quickness, rather than pure speed.\n\nA good defender, the Astros used Alvarez as a left fielder and designated\nhitter last year. He is capable of playing first base as well, offering new\nmanager Dusty Baker a bit of versatility in his game planning.\n\nTrades are made to meet team needs, be they for the present or the future. At\nthe time he was traded, the Dodgers had bid highly and won the services of\nYordan Alvarez as a Cuban international free agent. But then\u2026something must\nhave happened. Even though they had invested millions in signing Alvarez, they\nchanged their minds and traded him to the team that bid against them. The\nDodgers loss became a huge gain for the Astros.\n\nJosh Fields? He pitched parts of three seasons for the Dodgers, throwing 117.1\ninnings out of their bullpen. He pitched well, throwing to a collective 2.61\nwith a 1.04 WHIP. He saved two games in each of 2017 and 2018. He had a\ncombined 8-2 record. Fields pitched in the postseason in 2017 as well. He\nserved his purpose as a member of the Dodgers.\n\nThe trade of Josh Fields for Jordan Alvarez is one that isn\u2019t talked about\nmuch. However, to this writer, Alvarez has become a major ingredient in the\nAstros recipe for success. He represents one of those trades where a highly\nregarded, untested, inexperienced prospect player is traded and becomes a\nviable and highly important part of his new club.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/BerniePleskoff).\n\n[![Bernie\nPleskoff](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cc0afb14d36f6fbf3f336d230a0b7aa?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/\n\"Photo of Bernie Pleskoff\")\n\n[Bernie Pleskoff](https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/)\n\nAfter serving as a Dean of Campus Life at Loyola University Chicago for\nseveral decades, I began a transition to my lifetime dream-working in\nbaseball.

Both the **Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage** and the **S &P 500 **shed roughly 2.5%, and indexes remain lower by\nover 20% so far this year.\n\nThe dynamic coronavirus situation will hold investors' attention in the week\nahead, but there are several highly anticipated earnings announcements also on\nthe way. Below, we'll look at the metrics that might move the stocks of **Levi\nStrauss** (NYSE: LEVI), **Costco Wholesale** (NASDAQ: COST), and **MSC\nIndustrial Supply** (NYSE: MSM) over the next few trading days.\n\n![A man looks out the window while drinking\ncoffee.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F565739%2Fman-\nlooking-out-window.jpg&w=700)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n## **Levi Strauss' holiday sales**\n\nDenim specialist Levi Strauss will announce its latest earnings results on\nTuesday afternoon. Investors had several [reasons for\noptimism](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/3-reasons-to-be-\noptimistic-about-levi-strauss-\nstoc.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8986fd8c-1c91-442f-bd9d-e711658b520a)\nin the weeks following its last report, which showed flat sales and a modest\nprofit decline. Those weak numbers were affected by the timing shift around\nBlack Friday, though, and Levi's broader 2019 metrics were at the high end of\nmanagement's targets. \"Organic revenue growth met our expectations in spite of\nbeing masked by Black Friday falling in fiscal 2020,\" CEO Chip Bergh said in a\nlate-January press release.\n\nThat shift should help sales for the current reporting period, with revenue\nprojected to rise 6% according to management's latest outlook. Investors will\nbe more focused on how the manufacturer is preparing to handle slumping sales\ntied to temporary store closures, which began on March 12. Look for Bergh and\nhis team to discuss their plans to keep the digital sales channel going while\nmaking aggressive moves to shore up cash during this major disruption to its\noperations.\n\n## **Costco's sales volumes**\n\nCostco's shares have dramatically outperformed the wider market in recent\nweeks as the business benefits from huge demand shifts toward prepare-at-home\nfood. The chain will have an opportunity to confirm those growth predictions\nwhen it announces its March sales results on Wednesday.\n\nThe numbers might be staggering. Costco said on March 5 that sales soared\nduring the final days of February as COVID-19 worries struck consumers in the\nU.S. Customer traffic and average spending both jumped, in fact. Each of those\nmetrics was likely pushed even higher as restaurant chains closed or\ndramatically scaled back services around March 12.\n\nThat situation all but ensures that the [consumer\nstaples](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-consumer-staples-\nstocks.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8986fd8c-1c91-442f-bd9d-e711658b520a)\ngiant will announce unusually strong sales gains this week. But investors will\nhave to wait until its full quarterly report in late May to get updates on\nCostco's supply chain and management's outlook for the rest of fiscal 2020.\n\n## **MSC Industrial Supply's outlook**\n\nMSC Industrial steps up to the earnings plate on Wednesday morning, and\ninvestors are bracing for some bad news from the manufacturing repair and\nmaintenance expert. Demand trends were weak in the previous quarter, even\nthough the company outperformed management's targets on both the top and\nbottom lines.\n\nThe recent coronavirus disruption to major manufacturing industries,\nparticularly aerospace, might contribute to a sharp drop in sales projections\nfrom CEO Erik Gershwind and his team. At the same time, the weaker environment\nlikely scrapped plans for price increases that were originally set to start in\nlate February.\n\nThe growth slowdown won't jeopardize management's longer-term plan to move up\nthe value chain by providing more technical products and services. Yet MSC\nIndustrial still might warn of much more volatility ahead as the manufacturing\nsector tries to stabilize over the next few months.\n\n**10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to\nlisten.

Across the globe, health officials are struggling\nto cope with the growing number of patients, with the [World Health\nOrganization noting ](https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/situation-\nreports/20200319-sitrep-59-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c3dcdef9_2)that while it\nrequired three months to reach 100,000 cases, it took only 12 days to hit\nanother 100,000.\n\nThe resulting economic meltdown, which is sending several million workers\n[streaming into the unemployment\nline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/unemployment-\ninsurance-today-\ncoronavirus/?itid=ap_heatherlong&tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4),\nis outpacing the federal government\u2019s efforts to respond. As the Senate on\nFriday raced to complete work on a financial rescue package, the White House\nand key lawmakers were dramatically expanding its scope, pushing the\nlegislation far beyond the original [$1 trillion price\ntag](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-\nsenate-economic-plan/?tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n[$1 trillion stimulus bill is taking shape in\nCongress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/03/20/trump-\ncoronavirus-senate-economic-\nplan/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_7&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_7)\n\nWith each day, an unprecedented stoppage gathers force as restaurants, movie\ntheaters, sports arenas and offices close to shield themselves from the\ndisease. Already, it is clear that the initial economic decline will be\nsharper and more painful than during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nNext week, the Labor Department will likely report that roughly 3 million\nAmericans have filed first-time claims for unemployment assistance, more than\nfour times the record high set in the depths of the 1982 recession, according\nto Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That is just the start of a surge that could\nsend the jobless rate spiking to 20 percent from today\u2019s 3.5 percent, a\nJPMorgan Chase economist told clients on a conference call Friday.\n\nEstimates of the pandemic\u2019s overall cost are staggering. Bridgewater\nAssociates, a hedge fund manager, says the economy will shrink over the next\nthree months at an annual rate of 30 percent. Goldman Sachs pegs the drop at\n24 percent. JPMorgan Chase says 14 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are looking at something quite grave,\u201d said economist Janet L. Yellen, the\nformer Federal Reserve chair. \u201cIf businesses suffer such serious losses and\nare forced to fire workers and have their firms go into bankruptcy, it may not\nbe easy to pull out of that.\u201d\n\n[As layoffs skyrocket, the holes in America\u2019s safety net are becoming\napparent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/unemployment-\ninsurance-today-\ncoronavirus/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_15&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_15)\n\nLittle more than seven months before the presidential election, President\nTrump already is looking past the crisis and promising a swift recovery.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a rocket ship as soon as this thing gets solved,\u201d he said\nThursday. \u201c\u2026 We think it\u2019s going to come back really fast.\u201d\n\nMost economists expect the economy to [begin climbing out of its deep hole in\nthe second half of this\nyear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/13/us-may-already-be-\nrecession-it-could-linger-even-after-covid-19-crisis-is-\nover/?tid=lk_inline_manual_17&itid=lk_inline_manual_17). But those forecasts\ndepend upon the pandemic being brought under control and the United States and\nother governments enacting policies that prevent lasting harm to factories and\nfinancial arteries. Even if all that happens, the economy will be smaller at\nthe end of this year than it was at the beginning, according to Bridgewater,\nGoldman and JPMorgan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe truth is no one knows what will happen months from now. No one on Wall\nStreet or in Washington has any experience dealing with the kind of complex\nthreat that has suddenly materialized to upend American life \u2014 a global health\nscare that is strangling the economy and disrupting financial markets.\n\n[Americans are very likely to get $1,200 checks.

Hartmann, 34, normally handles 150 calls\na day from people interested in booking spa treatments and massages. But on\nSaturday and Sunday, she received a total of six.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer boss laid off most of the staff Monday morning. Tuesday, it was Hartmann\u2019s\nturn.\n\nHer husband, who works as a personal chef, also has lost his job. He had a\nside gig driving for Uber, but the college students who were his main\ncustomers disappeared earlier this month when the virus forced the University\nof Virginia to close. Now, the couple is worried about paying their $1,300\napartment rent.\n\n[Why low-wage workers could be especially hard hit by this\nrecession](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/service-sector-\nrecession-\ncoronavirus/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_29&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_29)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have savings. My rent is so high that I live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d\nHartmann said. \u201cEveryone is talking about how the coronavirus is affecting\nrestaurants, but it\u2019s affecting hotels, spas and hospitality in general. I\ndon\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay rent and pay my bills.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe situation is much the same in Mount Clemens, a suburb of Detroit. Steve\nManzo is a cook and bartender at an Irish pub who began the week anticipating\ndouble pay for St. Patrick\u2019s Day. Instead, he lost his job Monday and spent\nhours on the state\u2019s unemployment website trying to apply for government aid\nthat will make up less than half of his typical $60,000 annual income.\n\nAD\n\nLike many, Manzo lives paycheck to paycheck and is worried he might not even\nhave a restaurant to return to if the pandemic endures.\n\n\u201cI keep looking out my window and everything looks normal, but it doesn\u2019t feel\nnormal,\u201d Manzo said. \u201cI live downtown with bars and restaurants, and nobody is\nhere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n[Dow drops more than 900 points, oil dips below $20 as Wall Street wraps up\nworst week since\n2008](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/20/stocks-markets-today-\ncoronavirus/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_37&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_37)\n\nEven Yellen, 73, has not escaped the anxiety. She is hunkered down in her\nWashington home running economic forecasts that all look grim. Her son, who\nflew home from London on Saturday and was caught in the mass of people at\npassport control at Dulles International Airport, is self-quarantining in the\nfamily\u2019s basement to avoid endangering his mother. Yellen, one of the world\u2019s\ntop economists, leaves plates of food for him at the top of the basement\nstairs.\n\nSenate consideration of a financial rescue of more than $1 trillion came amid\nmounting signs of economic distress. In a joint letter, United Airlines chief\nexecutive Oscar Munoz and union officials warned of imminent layoffs and urged\nthe airline\u2019s nearly 100,000 employees to lobby Congress for help.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile many in Washington, D.C. now realize the gravity of this situation,\ntime is running out,\u201d the letter said. \u201c\u2026 To be specific, if Congress doesn\u2019t\nact on sufficient government support by the end of March, our company will\nbegin to take the necessary steps to reduce our payroll in line with the 60%\nschedule reduction we announced for April.

Governors in Florida, New Jersey and Nevada on Friday all took or\nindicated they would take significant action to limit activity outside the\nhome.\n\nAD\n\nThe only way to interrupt the viral blitzkrieg is to implement social\ndistancing. But keeping friends and co-workers apart is a recipe for crippling\nthe consumer spending that drives 70 percent of the $21 trillion economy.\n\nAD\n\nAlexis J. Walker, 40, earned about $60,000 last year with a series of jobs \u2014\nworking a part-time job at an after-school program in Philadelphia, which\nended a week ago; substitute teaching; working as a nanny; DJ-ing at parties;\nand selling homemade shea butter \u2014 and occasionally renting her apartment on\nAirbnb.\n\nLast weekend, Walker had $500 worth of babysitting and DJ gigs lined up, but\nall her customers canceled, along with her entire lineup of Airbnb guests this\nspring. Her landlord is letting her delay her rent payment, but she knows it\nwill eventually come due.\n\n\u201cThose bills still have to be paid. My debts keep accruing,\u201d said Walker, who\nhopes to establish a virtual after-school program to keep some money coming\nin. \u201cWhat will send this country into a depression is all the bills people\nwill have to pay in two months.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research,\nsaid a depression would involve a more protracted period of unusually low\nactivity than what seems likely.\n\n\u201cEverything depends on how long we are effectively locked down,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\nit\u2019s just two to three weeks, then it need not be this bad. But if we locked\ndown for most of the quarter, then we are looking at a really bad story.\u201d\n\nThe sudden turnabout in U.S. economic fortunes is without historic parallel.\nAs 2020 began, the U.S. economy had been expanding without interruption since\nthe middle of 2009. The jobless rate was near a half-century low, and the\nstock market was headed toward a record high.\n\nNow, the economy is screeching to a halt and the stock market is in free fall.\nOn Thursday, the Big Three automakers said they would close their factories\nthrough March 30. Real estate agents have canceled open houses. Marriott, the\nlargest hotel company in the world, is closing its hotels and furloughing\nthousands of workers.\n\nIn a video message to employees, CEO Arne Sorenson said he would not take any\nsalary for the rest of the year. The pandemic \u201cis like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen\nbefore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sudden loss of hotel business exceeded the combined effects of the Great\nRecession and the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On average, hotel\nrevenue is down 75 percent, which requires draconian retrenchment.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that I have never had a more difficult moment than this one,\u201d\nsaid an emotional Sorenson. \u201cThere is simply nothing worse than telling highly\nvalued associates, people who are the very heart of this company, that their\nroles are being impacted by events completely out of their control.\u201d\n\nOn Wall Street, the bloodletting has continued almost without interruption.\nAfter a brief respite Thursday, stocks sank again on Friday. The Dow Jones\nindustrial average closed at 19,173.98, down more than 913 points, or 4.6\npercent. Since reaching an all-time high on Feb. 12, the Dow has lost 35\npercent of its value.\n\n\u201cGet out, get out while you can before they shutter the whole darn United\nStates,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG, wrote in a note to\nclients. \u201cA stunning reversal of fortune for the best economy in history to\nthe worst economy in history in not even two months. The fastest recession in\nhistory. With no one spending a dime, it will stay that way a long, long\ntime.\u201d\n\nFor small-business owners, there is palpable fear of bankruptcy.\n\nBryan DeHenau already has filed for bankruptcy once before, when the\nconstruction industry crashed amid the Great Recession. In the years since\nthen, he\u2019s built up a roofing business in hopes of developing a more\nrecession-proof income stream.\n\nSix weeks ago, he said, he had work \u201c[coming out the ying-\nyang](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/10/americans-feel-good-\neconomy/?tid=lk_inline_manual_64&itid=lk_inline_manual_64).\u201d Now business is\ndown 50 percent and he worries about obtaining enough roof shingles for his\nremaining customers or dealing with a potential lockdown if Michigan follows\nthe lead of other states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to manage day to day.

in\nthe past year compared with its industry&rsquo;s 17.5%\nfall.%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/headwinds-swarm-expeditors-\nexpd%3A-time-to-dodge-the-stock-2020-04-07)\n\nShares of **Expeditors International of Washington** [EXPD](/market-\nactivity/stocks/expd) have declined 11.6% in the past year compared with its\n[industry](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/industry/transportation-\nservices-191)\u2019s 17.5% fall.\n\n![](https://staticx-\ntuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/expd%20price\\(7\\).jpg)\n\nExpeditors' primary revenue-generating segment, Airfreight Services, performed\ndisappointingly in 2019 (revenues declined 10.5%), mainly due to slowdown in\nglobal trade following the U.S.-China trade war. Given the company\u2019s\nconsiderable exposure in China (26% of last-year revenues came from China\nexports and imports) it is suffering due to soft shipment volumes. Notably,\nrevenues from North Asia dwindled significantly in 2019.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China is another woe. The company expects its\nfirst-quarter 2020 results to be hurt by this adversity. The extended closure\nof factories in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic might have dented freight\nvolumes in the March quarter. Global supply chains are likely to have been\ndisrupted by the dearth of raw materials, parts and supplies.\n\nExpeditors' rising operating expenses are a concern too. Operating expenses\nescalated 18% year over year in 2018 due to higher labor costs among other\nitems. Moreover, as Expeditors operates globally, it is exposed to foreign\ncurrency risks. Notably, foreign currency losses shot up more than 100% in\n2019 on a year-over-year basis.  \n  \n **Southbound Estimate Revisions**\n\nThe bearish sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks\nConsensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.7% downward in\nthe past 60 days to $3.46.\n\nAdditionally, Expeditors carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see [**the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks\nhere**](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-\nlist/?adid=zp_topnav_1list&icid=zpi_topnav_1list) **.**\n\nIn light of these downsides, it is advisable for investors to discard the\nstock from their portfolio for now.\n\n**Key Picks**\n\nBetter-ranked stocks in the Zacks [Transportation\n](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/sector/transportation-15)sector\ninclude Dynagas LNG Partners LP [DLNG](/market-activity/stocks/dlng), GATX\nCorporation [GATX](/market-activity/stocks/gatx) and Frontline Limited\n[FRO](/market-activity/stocks/fro), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You\ncan see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDynagas LNG Partners, GATX and Frontline expect the current-year earnings to\nincrease more than 2000%, 5.4% and 142%, respectively, year over year.\n\n**Today's Best Stocks from Zacks**\n\nWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating\nstrategies?

whole world is waiting for data on the first large studies of the biotech\ncompany\u2019s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir in Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe whole world is waiting for data on the first large studies of the biotech\ncompany\u2019s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir in Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe whole world is watching Gilead Sciences, waiting for data on the first\nlarge studies of the biotech company\u2019s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir\nin Covid-19 patients. Whichever way the data goes, it could move the entire\nmarket, given the focus on the drug as a possible short-term solution to blunt\nthe mortality of the pandemic.\n\nThe implications for Gilead (ticker: GILD) itself are less clear. In notes on\nTuesday, analysts projected that the results would move the stock 10% to 15%,\nthough the impact of remdesivir on the company\u2019s sales wouldn\u2019t be dramatic.\n\n\u201cThough the potential commercial opportunity for remdesivir affects our\n[discounted cash flow] by only $2/sh, we think that this readout will likely\nlead to a bigger stock move (10-15%) due to broad investor focus on the\nshares,\u201d wrote Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young in a Tuesday note.\n\nShares of Gilead are up 13.3% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is down\n16.2%. Investor excitement over Gilead in the context of the current epidemic\nhas waxed and waned, with the stock closing as high as $80.22 on March 6. The\nstock opened the year at $63.20, and closed Monday at $77.73.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Baird analyst Brian Skorney wrote that he expects data\nfrom two Chinese trials of remdesivir by the middle of this month, if not\nearlier. He wrote that he\u2019s hopeful, but not optimistic, about the drug\u2019s\nefficacy. \u201cRemdesivir mechanism has rationale but multiple factors weigh\nagainst it working,\u201d he said.\n\nSkorney noted that the drug didn\u2019t work against Ebola, the disease for which\nit was originally developed. He pointed out that the drug is delivered\nintravenously, which might make it hard to reach the cells in the lung\nairways, where the virus that causes Covid-19 replicates. And he added that\nthe progression of Covid-19 might make it hard for patients to get remdesivir\nearly enough to make a difference.\n\n\u201cA clear reduction in mortality or substantial improvements across a range of\nclinical endpoints are wins,\u201d Skorney wrote. He noted that the Chinese studies\nhave at least 20 endpoints, and there would be pressure to highlight a\npositive secondary endpoint or subgroup. \u201cA clear win is unlikely. But these\nare unclear times,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilead completed the $4.9 billion acquisition of the small cancer-\nfocused biotech FortySeven on Tuesday, adding the firm\u2019s experimental acute\nmyeloid leukemia drug magriolimab to Gilead\u2019s quiver.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that the fundamental story is improving as the company\ncontinues to do more deals over the long run,\u201d Cantor\u2019s Young wrote in her\nnote.\n\nGilead said over the weekend that it would donate its current supply of\nremdesivir, enough to treat 140,000 patients, and that it hoped to have 1\nmillion treatment courses manufactured by the end of the year.\n\nYoung said that she thought it more likely that remdesivir will work in mild\nand moderate Covid-19 patients than in severe patients, and that there will be\nhigh levels of regulatory flexibility if the trials are positive. But she said\nthat drug will likely have little impact on the company\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cWe think the shares could trade up 10-15% on a clear success for these trials\nin China or even the ones in May,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe acknowledge this is a big\nstock move for a close to $100B company with a drug that may only generate\nmodest sales, but we think investors may attribute value to success here in\nspite of what a [discounted cash flow] would suggest.\u201d\n\nGilead stock is down 4%, at $74.58, in recent trading. The S&P 500 is up 2.9%.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the\nauthor and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\n###  Trending Topics\n\n  * [ Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets \"Markets\")\n  * [ US Markets  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/us-markets \"US Markets\")\n  * [ Stocks  ](/news-and-insights/topic/markets/stocks \"Stocks\")\n  * [ Personal Finance  ](/topic/personal-finance \"Personal Finance\")\n\n###  Trending Articles\n\n  * [ 3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash  Mar 15, 2020 ](/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-in-the-coronavirus-fueled-market-crash-2020-03-15 \"3 Stocks to Buy in The Coronavirus-Fueled Market Crash\")\n  * [ How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work  Mar 30, 2020 ](/articles/how-expanded-coronavirus-unemployment-benefits-work-2020-03-30 \"How Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits Work\")\n  * [ 3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020  Jan 17, 2020 ](/articles/3-strong-buy-stocks-for-the-5g-revolution-in-2020-2020-01-17 \"3 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Stocks for the 5G Revolution in 2020\")\n  * [ The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020  Jan 22, 2020 ](/articles/the-5-largest-economies-in-the-world-and-their-growth-in-2020-2020-01-22 \"The 5 Largest Economies In The World And Their Growth In 2020\")\n\n##  Latest Stocks Videos\n\nNow Playing\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nWhere Can Investors Find Value in the Second Quarter?

(Photo by Chris\nBrunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nMatt Hancock didn\u2019t originally set out to use his daily press conference to\nthe nation to single out Premier League soccer players, but when he was asked\nhe didn\u2019t miss his opportunity. \u201cI think that everybody needs to play their\npart in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers too,\u201d\nthe UK government health secretary said when asked for his view on whether\nsoccer was doing enough to combat the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cGiven the sacrifices that many people are making including some of my\ncolleagues in the NHS who have made the ultimate sacrifice of going into work\nand have caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing that\nPremier League footballers can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and\nplay their part.\u201d\n\nThe response from the British soccer community was one of indignation. \u201cThe\nPremier league players are more than likely working on a proposal to help\nclubs, communities and the NHS,\u201d tweeted former Manchester United player\nturned TV pundit Gary Neville. \u201cIt takes longer than two weeks to put\ntogether. Matt Hancock calling them out when he can\u2019t get tests in place for\nNHS staff is a f****** cheek!\u201d\n\nToday In: [SportsMoney](https://www.forbes.com/sportsmoney)\n\n  * [\n\n### EXCLUSIVE: FC Barcelona Striker\u2019s Uncle Files For $50 Million IPO: \u2018We\nWant To Create 100,000 New Millionaires\u2019\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpettigrove/2020/04/08/exclusive-fc-\nbarcelona-strikers-uncle-files-for-50-million-ipo-we-want-to-\ncreate-100000-new-millionaires/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Mark Cuban Will Continue Paying His Employees Amid Coronavirus-Induced\nEconomic Downturn\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2020/04/08/mark-cuban-continue-\npaying-employees-coronavirus-economic-downturn/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Report: UFC 249 To Take Place At Tachi Palace In California\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2020/04/07/report-ufc-249-to-\ntake-place-at-tachi-palace-in-california/)\n\n![Sport Coronavirus - Sunday 15th March](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1207227033/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nA view of an LED sign informing fans that the game is off outside the London\nStadium, home of West ... [+] Ham United Football Club, following Friday's\nannouncement that the Premier League has suspended all matches until Saturday\nApril 4, 2020. (Photo by Steven Paston/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nPA Images via Getty Images\n\nNeville\u2019s comments proved extremely prescient. Within just 24 hours it was\nrevealed that Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson had contacted his fellow\nPremier League captains to organise a coronavirus fund that will raise\nmillions of pounds for the NHS. Man Utd players had also agreed to donate 30%\nof their salary to hospitals around Manchester.\n\nPlayers had been in discussions over how to best utilise their wealth long\nbefore Hancock\u2019s comments, but had been wary of taking a 30% cut in pay due to\nthe amount of tax that would be subsequently lost. This way players will\ncontinue to pay their tax at the higher income rate, contributing to state\ncoffers at a time of great, while also donating more on top of that.\n\nAnd yet while Premier League players were unfairly singled out for their\nperceived lack of contribution, the lack of contribution from the division\u2019s\nbillionaire owners has gone largely undetected. They are the ones who should\nhave been identified by Hancock for not playing their part.\n\nLast week saw Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, along with Bournemouth,\nBrighton, Newcastle United and Norwich, place non-playing employees on the UK\ngovernment\u2019s furlough scheme, a support programme that sees the taxpayer pick\nup 80% of staff payroll. Designed to help businesses in these unprecedented\ntimes, it\u2019s difficult to see why either club needed to do this.\n\nSpurs, for instance, recorded pre-tax profits of \u00a368 million this year while\npaying chairman Daniel Levy a salary of \u00a37 million which included a \u00a33 million\nfor the successful completion of the club\u2019s new stadium. Liverpool announced\nas recently as February 27 pre-tax profits of \u00a342 million and increased\nturnover to \u00a3533 million for 2018/19. There are soccer clubs who will require\ngovernment support to survive. Liverpool and Tottenham are not among them.\n\n![Derby County v Manchester United - FA Cup Fifth Round](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1205333050/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nDERBY, ENGLAND - MARCH 05: Wayne Rooney of Derby County leads his side out\nbefore the FA Cup Fifth ... [+] Round match between Derby County and\nManchester United at Pride Park on March 5, 2020 in Derby, England. (Photo by\nJames Williamson - AMA/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere is a societal and cultural dynamic to be considered here. Premier League\nfootballers are, by and large, of a working class background, yet time and\ntime again they are blamed for their lack of service to the community while\nthose with even greater influence and resources are given a free pass.\n\nWayne Rooney also pointed out in a newspaper column that soccer players are\nfrequently held to a higher standard than \u201cbig stars from other sports, who\nare able to avoid tax by living in places like Monaco,\u201d underlining the\ncultural urge to direct unwarranted criticism towards a largely working class\nsection of the sporting community. \u201cAt the moment it's almost a free-for-all:\nit's like the government, Premier League and sections of the media have set\nthe players up to fall,\u201d Rooney continued.\n\nMeanwhile, Tottenham owner Joe Lewis, with his net worth of \u00a34.3 billion, and\nLiverpool owners Fenway Sports Group, valued at over \u00a35 billion, will now\ncollect government welfare to pay their non-playing staff. It\u2019s a reflection\nof what the sport has become in the modern age and how if anyone is to blame\nfor a lack of compassion, for not playing their part in these times of crisis,\nit\u2019s certainly not the players on the pitch.\n\n **[Full coverage and live updates on the\nCoronavirus](https://www.forbes.com/coronavirus/)**\n\n[![Graham\nRuthven](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/abc3d1789c26e97b011e70757d4fafe1?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/grahamruthven/\n\"Photo of Graham Ruthven\")\n\n[Graham Ruthven](https://www.forbes.com/sites/grahamruthven/)\n\nI am a soccer writer based in the United Kingdom.

This gives hints of investors\u2019 likely future\nbehavior toward the market in the post-virus economy.\n\n**Homebuilding**\n\n**iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF**[ITB](/market-activity/funds-and-\netfs/itb) (up 13.9%) and **SPDR S &P Homebuilders ETF** [XHB](/market-\nactivity/funds-and-etfs/xhb) (up 12.6%) gained superbly on Apr 6 as the sector\nwas battered by the latest coronavirus-induced selloff. Lower-than-expected\ndecline in mortgage rates, likelihood of labor shortage, reduced wealth effect\nand the absence of the Spring selling season wreaked havoc on the sector in\nthe past month.\n\nITB and XHB were down about 42% and 39%, respectively, in the past month. If\ncoronavirus cases drop ahead, the Fed and government stimulus keep offering\nsupport and stock markets bounce back, housing ETFs are sure to make a\ncomeback (read: [What Fed Rate Cut? 5 Reasons Why Housing ETFs Are in\nTrouble](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/821216/what-fed-rate-cut-5-reasons-\nwhy-housing-etfs-are-in-trouble?art_rec=etfs-overview-zacks_news-\nID05-txt-821216)).\n\n**Retail**\n\n**SPDR S &P Retail ETF [XRT](/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/xrt) **added\n11.1% on Apr 6. The broader retail sector has been a victim of lockdowns and\ntemporary store closures. However, the fund XRT\u2019s top 10-holdings segment is\nloaded with some stocks that are doing well in wake of the pandemic. These\ncompanies are providers of Internet-based postage services like Stamps.com\nInc., online retail giant Amazon; grocery destinations like Grocery Outlet\nHolding Corp. and Walmart Inc.; low-priced retailers like Dollar General;\nonline pet retailer Chewy and pet pharmacy PetMed Express. These stocks are\nemerging as pandemic-proof stocks and will be equally important even after the\ncrisis (read: [Coronavirus Hits Feb Retail Sales: Winning & Losing\nETFs](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/821421/coronavirus-hits-feb-retail-\nsales-winning-amp-losing-etfs?art_rec=etfs-overview-zacks_news-\nID02-txt-821421)).\n\n**Semiconductor**\n\n**iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF**[SOXX](/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/soxx)\nadded about 10.2% on Apr 6.The rising work-and-learn-from-home trend boosted\nthe need for [PCs, laptops](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-\ncoronavirus-tech-demand/home-work-triggers-demand-jump-for-chips-laptops-and-\nnetwork-goods-idUSKBN21A0Y9) and other kind of computer peripherals. The\ndemand is soaring at both the commercial and retail levels. No wonder, such\nrequirements will keep the semiconductor space as a hot bet.\n\n**Gold Mining**\n\nThough stocks surged on Apr 6, the rally does not have legs as the global\ncoronavirus crisis will take time to fade. So, safe-haven demand for gold will\nremain strong, which in turn should boost gold mining activities. Several gold\nmines on the global level did not face lockdowns. Also, mining companies use\noil [as an input](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/trade-of-the-day-gdx-gold-\nmining-etf-has-multiple-tailwinds/), which has seen a huge price slump of\nlate. **VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF** [GDXJ](/market-activity/funds-\nand-etfs/gdxj) added about 9.6% (slightly lower than 10%) on Apr 6 (read:\n[ETFs at Risk as Oil Sees Worst Quarter on\nRecord](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/857644/etfs-at-risk-as-oil-sees-\nworst-quarter-on-record)).\n\n**Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?**\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well\nas top-performing ETFs, each week. **[Get it\nfree>>](https://www.zacks.com/registration/newsletter/?type=FND&ADID=Zcom_commentary_fundnewsletter_moneysense_ECD_ETF)**\n\n  \n[Click to get this free\nreport](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=RPT_7BST_LP194&ADID=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ZER_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=SPY&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[Invesco QQQ (QQQ): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=QQQ&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=EFA&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=XHB&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=XRT&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=EEM&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=SOXX&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=DIA&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=ITB&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=ACWI&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ): ETF Research\nReports](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=ETF225&adid=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ETF_ARTCAT_ETF_NEWS_AND_COMMENTARY&d_alert=rd_final_rank&t=GDXJ&split=1&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[To read this article on Zacks.com click\nhere.](http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/859273/4-sector-etfs-that-were-up-\nabout-double-digit-on-monday?cid=CS-NASDAQ-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-859273)  \n  \n[Zacks Investment Research](http://www.zacks.com/)  \n  \n[Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yet here we all are, isolated in our homes,\nworking hard to adhere to the directives from county and state health\nofficials.\n\nIt is inspiring \u2014 and humbling \u2014 that, in the midst of this disruption and\nworry, hundreds of you are choosing to start subscriptions to the Weekly and\nPalo Alto Online to help sustain your source of community news and\ninformation. Your outpouring of support is helping us carry on.\n\nOur office is closed and our employees are sheltering at home. But they are\nhard at work. Serving our readers during times of crisis or natural disasters\nwith accurate and timely reporting is one of the most important functions of a\nlocal news organization. You are witness to that work.\n\nI have always considered bringing the community together in challenging times\nto be an essential part of our mission, and I am proud of how our staff,\ncoordinating through video conferences and phone calls, has worked as a team\nin service to you while taking care of themselves and supporting their\nfamilies and friends.\n\nBut in the midst of this effort, we also have needed to take steps to preserve\nour ability to continue this important work. This week I had to make painful\ndecisions to lay off several staff members, furlough others and reduce hours\nfor some. We simply cannot sustain our payroll costs while we have only a\nfraction of our normal advertising revenue, especially when we have no way to\nknow how long this crisis will last.\n\nWe are not alone. Local newspapers all over the country face similar or worse\nchallenges, and scores have had to shut down. We are determined to not let\nthat happen here.\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to those of you who have already stepped up and started\nsubscriptions entitling you to unlimited access to Palo Alto Online and mail\ndelivery to your home of the Palo Alto Weekly. But we need thousands more of\nyou to do the same.\n\nWith your help, now and in the future, we'll proudly be bringing you important\nnews about Palo Alto and the region for decades to come.

But after talking\nto 3M CEO Mike Roman, Trump says he was happy with the company's efforts.\n\n\"3M and the Administration worked together to ensure that this plan does not\ncreate further humanitarian implications for countries currently fighting the\nCOVID-19 outbreak, and committed to further collaborate to fight price gouging\nand counterfeiting,\" wrote 3M in a blog post Monday about the arrangement.\n\n## Now what\n\n3M is importing these masks from its manufacturing facility in China. This\nmeans the imports will supplement its monthly U.S. production capacity of 35\nmillion N95 respirators.\n\n\"As a global company, 3M has manufacturing operations around the world to\nserve local and regional markets,\" the company said. \"As the pandemic unfolds\nin different stages around the world, 3M will continue to work with\ngovernments to direct respirators and other supplies to serve areas most in\nneed.\"\n\n**10 stocks we like better than 3M**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to\nlisten.

But assuming that the U.S.\nand Europe can avoid economic disaster as the COVID-19 outbreak recedes, Ford\nwill almost certainly be fine in the long run.\n\nI think investors are tuning into that likelihood now, and scooping up Ford's\nshares while the discounted pricing lasts.\n\n## Now what\n\nFord has been good about keeping its investors and other stakeholders informed\nof its moves as the crisis has unfolded. We won't have to wait too long to\nhear much more directly from Hackett and his team -- Ford is scheduled to\nreport first-quarter earnings after the market closes on April 28.\n\n**10 stocks we like better than Ford**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to\nlisten.

The latest indication of this is an update from sturdy\neggs-and-pancakes slinger **Denny's** (NASDAQ: DENN), which provided a gloomy\nforecast for the immediate future of its business in a regulatory document\nfiled on Tuesday.\n\nIn its update, Denny's said that in the present environment, it now expects\n[comparable-restaurant sales](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-are-\nsame-store-\nsales.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=f37530bb-c9cb-42b3-9bf7-6a664fdc61d3)\nwill decline by around roughly 6% on a year-over-year basis in its just-\ncompleted first quarter.\n\n![Exterior of a Denny's\nrestaurant.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F567219%2Fdennys-\nrestaurant.jpg&w=700)\n\nImage source: Denny's.\n\nAlthough \"comps\" rose by 2% in February, they fell precipitously (by 19%) in\nMarch as the closures of \"non-essential businesses\" -- such as dine-in\nrestaurants -- were mandated throughout the U.S. The company said that the\nvast majority of its restaurants have switched to take-out and delivery only.\nHowever, the loss of steady dine-in restaurant traffic is going to hurt.\n\nDenny's did not proffer guidance for the full fiscal year in its filing.\n\nIt did detail a number of cost efficiency measures it was adopting to cope\nwith the current reality, however.\n\nAmong other actions, its top executives, including the CEO and CFO, have had\ntheir base salaries reduced (although Denny's did not specify by how much). In\nthe lower ranks, the company has enacted work-reduction furloughs. It has also\nsuspended all travel and mandated a hiring freeze. Finally, the company is\ndeferring all planned restaurant remodeling projects.\n\nThis active response seemed to win the approval of investors. On Tuesday,\nDenny's shares closed the day 2.3% higher, which bettered the general slump of\nthe broader equities market and numerous [consumer\ngoods](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-consumer-staples-\nstocks.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=f37530bb-c9cb-42b3-9bf7-6a664fdc61d3)\nstocks.\n\n**10 stocks we like better than Denny's**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to\nlisten.

250 firm FDM\n\n![US-IT-ZOOM](https://www.cityam.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/1208677867-960x665.jpg)(via Getty Images)\n\nThe destruction caused by the Covid-19 outbreak is difficult to comprehend,\nrobbing people of their lives and livelihoods without mercy. Our NHS,\ncharities, large businesses, start-ups and entrepreneurs have all been hit\nhard, with the elderly and vulnerable hit the hardest.\n\nI\u2019ve been in business for 40 years now. Together we\u2019ve survived the tornado of\n1987, Black Wednesday, the dot com bubble bursting, the global financial crash\nand I was in DC when the plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, yet right now it\nfeels like we have all five crises at once.\n\nAs a FTSE 250 company with nearly 6,000 staff globally, we have a huge\nresponsibility to ensure each and every single one of our people is safe,\nsecure and looked after, something which is incredibly challenging due to\nsocial isolation and remote working.\n\nPeople are the lifeblood of any business, and when the chips are down a good\nemployer will stand by their people.\n\nLike many company owners right now, I\u2019ve been trying to manage the huge task\nof shifting to a 100% remote working model. Whilst an optimistic view of the\nscenario is to just switch on email and work from home, the reality is\npayroll, HR, sales and support networks need to quickly adapt to this new way\nof working, without error, which I can tell you first hand is easier said than\ndone.\n\nLike many CEOs I have had to use my past experience to keep a cool head and\nfocus on making sure we deliver a robust and secure online environment for our\nemployees to alleviate the inevitable security fears. We managed to achieve\nthis in four days, with the help of our brilliant IT staff and software\npartners.\n\nOur people come from all walks of life and backgrounds. Women returners, ex-\nmilitary service personnel, fresh-faced graduates and those looking for a\ncareer in IT.\n\nMany of them are now juggling home working with family life, caring for sick\nor elderly relatives. As a Dad myself I know this is no easy task, I also know\nthat many of our employees will feel lonely, isolated and in need of help in\nthe coming weeks.\n\nSo how can companies foster a working from home culture that ensures everyone\nfeels valued and how on earth can this be put into motion in a short space of\ntime? For a start, I believe the CEO should be highly visible at all times\nduring a crisis, which means I am constantly on company-wide video calls,\nanswering questions online and appearing in our weekly #RodsRoundUp video\nposted on Twitter, updating our people on developments as they happen.\n\nWe\u2019ve introduced company quiz schemes, problem solving tasks and workgroup\nonline meetings, so that everyone can get involved and raise a smile, despite\nthe turmoil.\n\nOur HR team is operating as usual, providing promotions and annual reviews via\nprivate video links and every member of staff has been offered mental health\nsupport and guidance if they are feeling isolated or anxious.\n\nThe fact remains that until the lockdown is lifted, our people will continue\nto be working from home for the foreseeable future. So rather than view this\nsituation with regret, we must embrace it, look after each other and throw\nourselves into new ways of working. It\u2019s also vital that companies keep paying\ntheir staff and don\u2019t stop recruiting; those that freeze the hiring process\nwill find themselves dangerously lacking in talent once things get moving\nagain.\n\nNobody can lessen the harsh consequences brought on by Covid-19, but as\nbusiness leaders and employers, we have a duty to ensure our staff can do\ntheir jobs online to the best of their ability. There may be chaos, there will\nbe heartache, sleepless nights and huge challenges ahead, but putting people\nfirst should be a top priority for every business right now.\n\n _City A.M.'s opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and\ndebate.

That\nis because FOCS recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the\nstock is nearing a bottom.\n\n**What is a Hammer Chart Pattern?**\n\nA hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in\ncandlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day,\nbut then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above\nits opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it\ncan suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that\nbetter days are ahead.\n\n**Other Factors**\n\nPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the\nsluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 3 estimates have gone\nhigher, compared to 2 lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in\nthe right direction.\n\nEstimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has Zacks Rank #2\n(Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout\nsoon.

stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-airline-\nstocks.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3293b67a-3573-49b6-9b2c-d4ec46587e57)\nare flying through turbulence right now, bouncing up and down based on\nsentiment about how long the COVID-19 pandemic will halt travel and how\nquickly demand for flights will recover.\n\nOn Monday, optimism dominated Wall Street, and airlines at least initially got\ncaught in the updraft. Shares of **JetBlue Airways** (NASDAQ: JBLU) and\n**Alaska Air Group** (NYSE: ALK) both gained more than 10% early in the day,\nand **United Airlines Holdings** (NASDAQ: UAL), **American Airlines Group**\n(NASDAQ: AAL), and **Delta Air Lines** (NYSE: DAL) were all up more than 5%.\n\nAll of the stocks gave up some of the gains as the day wore on, and Delta\nactually turned slightly negative due to company-specific news, but there is a\nfeeling of hope riding with the airlines on Monday.\n\n## So what\n\nAirlines [have been hit hard by the\npandemic](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/02/why-shares-of-major-\nairlines-lost-altitude-in-\nmarc.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3293b67a-3573-49b6-9b2c-d4ec46587e57),\nwith travel demand all but disappearing overnight. They have cut flights and\ngrounded planes to try to trim costs, but no amount of cutting can offset no\nrevenue coming in the door.\n\nThe U.S. government came through [with $50 billion to support the\nindustry](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/26/why-airline-shares-are-up-\ntoday.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3293b67a-3573-49b6-9b2c-d4ec46587e57),\nbut that cash will only last for so long. After plunging for weeks, airlines\nhave stabilized somewhat since the bailout became law. But investors remain\nworried that if traffic does not return in the months to come, bankruptcies\nare possible.\n\n![Planes parked at the\nairport.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F566960%2Fairport-\nairplanes-source-getty.jpg&w=700)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMonday was a relatively upbeat day, with markets encouraged that the rise in\nCOVID-19 cases in major hot spots seems to have slowed over the weekend. That\nat least allows for hope that the pandemic could be contained by late spring,\nand the economy could start normalizing as soon as the summer.\n\nThe industry also likely got a boost from research notes from both J.P. Morgan\nand Citigroup that, while cautious, assumed the airlines would be able to\nsurvive without bankruptcies.\n\nDelta was the weakest of the major airlines on news that **Berkshire\nHathaway** had [sold part of its\nstake](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/06/warren-buffett-sells-airline-\nstocks-in-an-\nabrupt-r.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3293b67a-3573-49b6-9b2c-d4ec46587e57)\nin the airline, barely a month removed from [adding\nshares](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/03/warren-buffetts-berkshire-\nhathaway-increases-\ndelta.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3293b67a-3573-49b6-9b2c-d4ec46587e57).\nBerkshire and Warren Buffett don't have the reputation for quickly moving in\nand out of positions, and the rapid reversal seems to have spooked investors\nhoping for a quick recovery.\n\n## Now what\n\nIt's worth noting Berkshire still has a substantial position in Delta. So even\nif the company and its famed investor aren't bullish on a quick rebound, from\nwhat is known, they are not predicting gloom or doom, either. Which feels\nabout right: The airline sector is severely troubled right now, and in the\nworst case could end up with liquidations, but there is at least some reason\nfor hope that a slow, gradual recovery is more likely.\n\nFor now, expect the airlines to trade up and down, not just on company- and\nindustry-specific news but on updates on the pandemic and its impact on the\nU.S. economy as well. There will be good days, like today, and there are\nlikely to be further down days, but for investors who can stomach the\nvolatility and hold for the long haul, I continue to believe it is safe to\nconsider airline stocks.\n\n**10 stocks we like better than JetBlue Airways**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to\nlisten.

(Photo courtesy Jasmine Bryant)\n\nIt\u2019s usually a packed commute when Prince George\u2019s County Facilities Director\nJasmine Bryant goes to her job at the Theresa Banks Memorial Aquatic Center,\nbut now when she heads out to do payroll and other essential duties the\nbeltway is \u201ceerily empty.\u201d\n\nPrince George\u2019s County, Maryland currently leads the state with 785\ncoronavirus cases and 16 related deaths. State efforts to flatten the curve\ninclude a directive released March 23 ceasing \u201cAll elective and non-urgent\nmedical procedures and appointments,\u201d raising concerns about gender-affirming\ncare.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I would have been devastated if my surgery had been cancelled\nbecause it was something I had been looking forward to for years,\u201d Bryant, who\nrecovered from her own surgeries earlier this year, said, \u201cBut people starting\nthe process, it might be grinding to a halt, so I consider myself very\nfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe facilities director, who is also a peer facilitator for a transgender\nsupport group at the D.C. Center, considers herself lucky in many ways despite\nbarriers imposed by the crisis.\n\nThough she lives under a stay-at-home order in Upper Marlboro, she has\nroommates and plenty of pets to keep her company.\n\n\u201cI have a dog,\u201d Bryant said, her usual business-like voice softening.\n\u201cOliver\u2019s a beagle-shepard mix about three or four years old.\u201d\n\nThough Oliver belongs to one of her roommates, Bryant plays with him and he\nsnuggles up to her or another friend when he\u2019s lonely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely helpful because you don\u2019t feel nearly as isolated,\u201d she said,\npausing to consider her constant and steady friend. \u201cI do worry about when we\ndo go back to \u2018normal\u2019 and how he is going to handle the separation. He\u2019s been\nunder me, enjoying me being here.\u201d\n\nSomething in her voice shows that she clearly enjoys his being there as well.\n\nBryant is also fortunate in that she still pulls in a check. She risks her\nhealth to ensure others are paid as well.\n\n\u201cI feel like making payroll is that much more important. I\u2019m full-time but I\nneed to make sure my part-time employees are paid correctly,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cI do that by calling employees and making sure they understand how the\nprocess works, so they can reach out and utilize their benefits also.\u201d\n\nThis concern for her coworkers spills over to a larger concern for the\ntransgender community, especially those who might no longer have access to\nwhat could be life-saving care.\n\nThe American Medical Association has repeatedly asserted, most notably since\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s 1994 Farmer v. Brennan decision and up to 2018 arguments\nagainst the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s proposed exclusion, that gender-\naffirming surgery is widely accepted as medically necessary for patients\nsuffering with gender dysphoria.\n\nWhile Bryant understands the urgent need to prioritize hospital services for\nthe surge of cases brought on by the global pandemic, she worries about the\nmessage sent to the transgender community.\n\n\u201cIt really hurts and it really is a sign that people aren\u2019t really taking the\ntime to understand trans issues,\u201d she said, trying hard not to be upset. \u201cFor\na lot of people it is a life or death issue, and to minimize it as\n\u2018nonessential\u2019 is really hurtful. We realize that now may not be the best\ntime, but that doesn\u2019t mean our care is not essential to our wellbeing.\u201d\n\nAs a peer facilitator, Bryant particularly worries about trans youth who may\nlack the positive, affirming connections they may have forged prior to the\nlockdown orders.\n\n\u201cThey may be at home in a situation where they are not accepted or validated,\u201d\nshe explained. \u201cI feel that something major taken away from them is the\nability to go out and be themselves. So, I reach out to them and see how they\nare doing.\u201d\n\nIn her group, Bryant uses video conferencing to check in with members who may\nnot be as fortunate as she is to be in a supportive place both socially and at\nwork.\n\n\u201cI was promoted last year at this time,\u201d she said, speaking of the positive\nreaction most coworkers have had to her transition. \u201cI was going to be on a\npanel in D.C. for diversity in aquatics, which is a male-dominated field. It\nwas scheduled for later this month and has been cancelled.\u201d\n\nBryant was nominated by friends who told the organizer that she had recently\ntransitioned. The organizer extended an invitation to Bryant as a trans woman\nof color.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an opportunity for visibility that has been lost,\u201d Bryant lamented.\n\u201cBut they are talking about extending the opportunity next year.\u201d\n\nOther lost opportunities for visibility and support sadden Bryant as well.\n\n\u201cI was looking forward to Pride and it\u2019s been cancelled. I knew that was\ncoming. Black Pride was the first to cancel and that\u2019s how I knew that Capital\nPride and Trans Pride were going to be cancelled as well.\u201d\n\n(As of this week, Capital Pride has said Pride is postponed, but Black Pride\nannounced last week it is cancelling this year\u2019s celebration.)\n\nBryant said she especially misses going to A League of Her Own and Nellie\u2019s\nSports Bar, both in D.C. She said those were two places in particular where\nshe felt safe to be herself.\n\nTo keep herself positive and busy, Bryant cooks and participates in virtual\nfood challenges with friends from a part-time hospitality job at D.C.\u2019s\nNational Harbor resort. Bryant lost 120 pounds last year and makes healthy but\nsumptuous comfort foods like vegetarian burgers and sausages for the\nchallenge.\n\n\u201cLittle things brighten up our spirits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have to kind of\ntake care of each other right now, whether by group chat or by just checking\nin and being positive with each other.\u201d\n\nThough Bryant worries about her community, she knows we\u2019ll all get through\nthis together.\n\n\u201cI would say wherever you fall in the LGBTQ community spectrum, you are valid\nand you are important, whether or not you are in a situation where you can\u2019t\nget that from the people around you right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not any\nless valued and we will eventually return to a sense of normalcy.\u201d\n\n[Black

[Join BI\nPrime](/subscription/prime?r=readmode) and start reading now.\n\n  * **As the coronavirus crisis forces people to work remotely, tools that help them stay connected and productive are booming in popularity.**\n  *  **We asked a select group of VCs to name enterprise startups that could take off this year as a result of the changing work environment.**\n  * Each investor named two \"future of work\" startups: one in their portfolio, and one company they admire but have no financial interest in.\n  * [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet).\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has changed not only where people work from, but how\nthey work and what tools they use.\n\nAlready, apps like [Zoom](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-filing-impact-\ncoronavirus-eric-yuan-2020-3) and\n[Slack](https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-7000-new-paid-customers-since-\nfebruary-coronavirus-2020-3) have seen huge increases in usage in the past few\nweeks, as users grab onto ways to stay connected in their work and personal\nlives while social distancing.\n\nThe urgent need for better work tools could catapult some enterprise startups\ninto the pantheon of unicorn startups, as their users multiply and venture\ncapital investors jump to fund them.\n\nWe wanted to find the startups that are already transforming the future of\nwork, defining the new ways in which people are doing their everyday jobs. We\nreached out to a select group of venture capitalists with enterprise bets in\ntheir portfolios and asked them to name the startups that are positioned to\nhave very good years.\n\nWhen we spoke to each investor, we set some ground rules for participation:\n\n  1. The VC had to tell us about one startup in their portfolio. After all, they had enough conviction in the company to write it a check.\n  2. We also asked them to name one \"future of work\" startup where they have no financial interest. Those are the companies they're closely watching, maybe with a bit of envy.\n\nTheir nominations cover all aspects of work, from processes like recruiting\nand onboarding to products such as video conferencing, chatbots, and email.\n\n **Here are the 30 startups they named, listed in alphabetical order:**\n\n## Airtable: A smart spreadsheet app with a cult following in tech\n\n![Howie Liu](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5bc60204df918d124e4bbba8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nHowie Liu is the cofounder and CEO of Airtable.

Ling said Airtable\nis \"redefining the way users interact with spreadsheets, databases, calendars,\netc. in a more flexible and extensible way.\"\n\nIn 2020, Airtable is expanding into [new engineering and sales and marketing\ncenters in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas,\nrespectively](https://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-expansion-growth-\naustin-mountain-view-engineering-sales-howie-liu-2020-3), as the company looks\nahead to its next phase of growth.\n\n## BeyondHQ: Full-stack support for opening satellite offices\n\n![Madhu Chamarty BeyondHQ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5e849430671de07893363ce4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nMadhu Chamarty, BeyondHQ Founder & CEO  BeyondHQ\n\n**Startup:** [BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/)\n\n **VC:** Hunter Walk, Homebrew\n\n **Relationship:** No financial interest\n\n **Total funding raised:** [$1.9\nmillion](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265596-76/company/profile)\n\n **What it does:** BeyondHQ helps startups build and staff up satellite\noffices in new locations, outside of big tech hubs.\n\n **Why it will boom in 2020:** As the cost of living in Silicon Valley only\nincreases, companies are already thinking about hiring elsewhere.

These clinicians, nurses and\ndoctors, are 'on the front lines' of patient care -- and also absorbing the\nmost risk in these emerging digital care ventures,\" Baker Spohn said.\n\n\"2020 is the year for Wheel because the current public health crisis is not\nonly showing the power and importance of virtual care and triage, but also\nrapidly accelerating its adoption by patients and healthcare providers,\" she\nadded.\n\n## Zapier: A way to synchronize information across apps\n\n![Zapier cofounders \\(resized for online\\)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5e78f0b52d654f347c0f8916?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nMike Knoop, left; Bryan Helmig, center; and Wade Foster are the cofounders of\nZapier.

Now, Zapier helps move data from one app to\nanother, even if they don't have an official integration -- no code required.\n\n **Why it will boom in 2020:** \"Zapier connects all of your business systems,\nletting teams build custom workflows with no coding at all,\" said Yen, noting\nits more than 2,000 app integrations.\n\n\"By connecting all of your systems, Zapier lets your team focus on the most\nimportant work -- not on manual processes, dedupe, and data entry.\"\n\n## 1Password: A master password keeper\n\n![1password](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5dcc82473afd374c006121b4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nDave Teare, left; Jeff Shiner, second from left; Roustem Karimov, second from\nright; and Sara Teare are the cofounders of 1Password.  1Password\n\n**Startup:** [1Password](https://1password.com/)\n\n **VC:** Arun Mathew, Accel\n\n **Relationship:** Investor\n\n **Total funding raised:** [$200\nmillion](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/267029-02/company/profile#deal-\nhistory/126384-49T)\n\n **What it does:** A password manager that can store and remember passwords so\nusers can store all their passwords securely and prevent breaches.\n\n**Why it will boom in 2020:** 1Password was self-funded for 14 years before it\ngot its first investment, [in the form of $200 million in Series A funding\nfrom Accel](https://www.businessinsider.com/accel-biggest-check-ever-venture-\ncapital-security-startup-1password-2019-11) last November. It's also notable\nfor being a mostly all remote workforce since it started. Those are two things\nthat made the company stand out to Mathew, and why he thinks it will boom this\nyear.\n\n\"As we're increasingly seeing the world's workforce shift to distributed\nteams, 1Password gives companies the peace of mind to know their data is\nsecure no matter where their employees are located,\" he said.\n\nLoading Something is loading.\n\n_Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?\nOr a tip on how your town or community is handling the pandemic?

Fueled by this growing trend, bars\nand restaurants played a significant role in the country\u2019s recovery from the\nGreat Recession. The number of establishments\n[increased](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS000205722?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)\n17% between 2009 and 2018, making up over 75% of all growth in the [leisure\nand\nhospitality](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS0002051026?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)\nsector during this time period. These \u201c[third\nplaces](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-\ncommunity-builders/)\u201d are the life blood of many American towns, vital to our\ncultural fabric and employment base.\n\nThis brief captures COVID-19\u2019s rapid impact on the food and beverage industry.\nIn the last week, we spoke with 13 servers (including bartenders and wait\nstaff), managers, and restaurant owners in the Washington, D.C. metro area to\nunderstand how the impact is playing out in our own backyard.1 We asked them\nto share their experiences and perceptions of what has happened over the last\nthree weeks and what forms of support they would find most helpful.\n\nThis piece builds on a [previous blog\npost](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/24/covid-19-will-\nupend-retail-but-there-are-steps-we-can-take-to-save-it/) about broader shifts\nin the retail landscape being accelerated by COVID-19. A forthcoming piece\nwill examine the unemployment insurance (UI) safety net typically available\nfor food and beverage workers and provide an early analysis of what the\n[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)\nAct](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text) does\nand does not do for these workers.\n\n## **The early impact on food and beverage businesses**\n\nThe initial effect of the pandemic was a precipitous drop in customers. This\nhas a tremendous impact on both a server\u2019s income and the owner\u2019s revenue.\nSeveral business owners and managers that we interviewed noted that delivery\nand takeout orders were not getting sufficient customer response.\n\n\u201cAt first, we decided to do [take-out and delivery], and we had zero foot\ntraffic,\u201d said a manager of a restaurant and entertainment center in Virginia.\n\u201cWe are located in a town center\u2026We have apartment buildings here. We offered\napartments delivery and said that we would bring food to them to try to stay\nopen. We did $300 in sales. Labor costs were about $600. Due to this, we\nunfortunately decided that we had to close our doors.\u201d\n\nThe next step for many business owners was to consider how long they could\nkeep their workers on payroll, as well as how to communicate with them about\nshutting down and their options afterward.\n\n\u201cI made a commitment to our employees to keep the team together, because we\nhave a management team and marketing guy, and sales,\u201d one owner told us. \u201cWe\nhave a really tight team of people, but everybody has to take a 20% pay cut.\nI\u2019m the owner and I\u2019m taking [no pay]. I\u2019m looking to try to leverage or sell\noff some equity in the business to help raise money to cover those folks so\nthat they don\u2019t end up on unemployment.\u201d\n\nNot all owners are as protective of their staff. One bartender told us that\nshe did not receive official communication from management that she should not\nreport to work until several days after the establishment closed. \u201cI had a\nshift that was cancelled on [March 14], and they never said anything to me,\u201d\nthe bartender told us. \u201cI don\u2019t feel valued as an employee. I doubt that any\nof us do.\u201d\n\nReflecting on what is happening sector-wide, a Baltimore brewery owner shared\nhis concerns that small restaurants will have even more difficulty sustaining\npayrolls, which he believes will have an almost immediate impact on workers.\n\n\u201cSmall business makes up a huge proportion of employment in this country, and\nwhen you hit pause for the hospitality industry and a lot of small\nmanufacturers, the payroll is just the first thing to suffer,\u201d said the\nbrewery owner. \u201cEven a really successful restaurant may have a 10% margin, and\nif you have a big payroll every week and that\u2019s your largest expense, that\ndoesn\u2019t go very far.\u201d\n\nEven after turning off the lights and laying off staff, restaurants and bars\nwill still owe rent. This was top of mind for one owner of a small, family-run\nmall food stand. \u201cWe are really afraid of how we are going to pay the rent,\u201d\nshe told us. \u201cThe rent is super expensive, and we are not making any money.\u201d\n\nA manager at a Virginia restaurant added, \u201cOne of the things that Italy has\ndone is rent forgiveness\u2026If they were to do rent forgiveness for the month,\nthat would help small businesses everywhere. My restaurant pays $25,000 in\nrent per month. Even in our slow month, last month, we ended up doing $150,000\nin sales. But [what happens] when that drops down to less than $10,000 and we\nhave to pay $25,000 in rent and our loans?\u201d\n\nIn addition to rent and debt, some operating costs and other sunk costs such\nas insurance premiums aren\u2019t as easy to turn off as the utilities. Small\nbusinesses need additional liquidity\u2014quickly\u2014in order to meet these\nobligations or they will fail.\n\nThe federal government has moved fairly quickly to provide some relief to\nsmall businesses and unemployed workers through the [Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-\nbill/6201) and the [CARES Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/748/text). The latter provides $350 billion in loans to\nbusinesses with under 500 employees affected by the coronavirus, including up\nto eight weeks of reimbursement for those loans for payroll, utilities, and\nother eligible expenses. But it is unclear if this package [will be\nenough](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/small-businesses-get-help-in-\ncoronavirus-relief-bill-but-is-it-enough.html).\n\n## **What\u2019s happening to workers**\n\nA typical food and beverage establishment employs \u201cfront-of-house\u201d employees\n(such as servers, bartenders, hosts, and bussers), back-of house employees\n(cooks, dishwashers, and food prep workers), and managerial or supervisory\nstaff. Work arrangements in this sector range tremendously, from entry-level,\nmostly part-time staff with no health insurance or other benefits (more common\nin smaller or lower-cost establishments) to highly experienced, full-time\nstaff with benefits (more common in high-end and larger companies).\n\nAcross our interviews, workers, managers, and owners alike expressed feeling\noverwhelmed and fearful about what would happen to the industry in the coming\nmonths. Servers and managers we interviewed were in different financial\npositions depending on whether they had savings, debt, existing health\nconditions, or a partner who was employed or had health insurance. Several\nnoted that most of workers in the industry tend to live paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nThe top concerns of workers were how they would pay their rent or mortgage,\nwhether they would lose their health insurance (if they had it), what they\nwould do if they got sick (especially if they did not have health insurance),\nhow they would pay for food and utilities, and whether they would get further\nin debt than they already were.\n\n\u201cI have cancer, so I can\u2019t really go out at all,\u201d one manager told us. \u201cMy\nnext scan is scheduled for May 11, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get it.\u201d\n\nSome of the workers and managers we interviewed had health insurance through a\npartner, but most said that they were uninsured or would lose their health\ninsurance by the end of April. The CARES Act does not include provisions for\nthose who are or will become uninsured due to job loss or benefit cuts. Those\nworking in the restaurant industry who contract COVID-19 or experience another\nadverse health event in the coming months may face increased medical debt, on\ntop of everything else.\n\nWorkers and managers we interviewed were especially concerned about their\nestablishments\u2019 dishwashers. Dishwasher positions are typically very low-paid\nhourly workers, often occupied by recent immigrants\u2014both the undocumented and\nthose who have legal authorization to work.\n\n\u201cI really feel for people who don\u2019t have documentation who are already here\nand working their asses off, because they are getting really screwed right\nnow,\u201d one server told us. \u201cI want some sort of compassionate response. We can\nsay, \u2018Okay, you need to eat, and you can\u2019t pack up and go back to El Salvador\nright now, so what can we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough the CARES Act expands unemployment insurance (UI) eligibility to low-\nwage workers who would not normally meet their state\u2019s minimum income\nrequirements, it does not expand it to undocumented workers.\n\nAlmost everyone that we interviewed felt that a $1,200 direct payment from the\nfederal government was a good start, but won\u2019t be enough if the pandemic\ncontinues for several months. \u201cMy rent is $1,700,\u201d one server said. \u201cNo,\n$1,200 is not enough. It might be enough for somebody in the middle of the\ncountry, but not for people in big cities.\u201d\n\nSeveral people we interviewed suggested suspending rent payments until the\npandemic ends, and compensating landlords or banks for it.\n\n\u201cD.C. is not allowing any evictions, but I\u2019m banned from working, legally\nbanned from collecting an income,\u201d one server told us, referencing the ban on\nin-restaurant dining. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that my landlord gets paid.\nIt\u2019s a little unfair when the government says, \u2018You can\u2019t have a job anymore.\u2019\nBut they can still take your money.\u201d\n\nThe CARES Act retroactively adds $600 to unemployment insurance benefit levels\nfrom January 27 until July 31, 2020. But it is unclear to what extent state\nlabor agencies will be able to implement these changes smoothly and accurately\non such short notice given the unprecedented demand on their UI systems. For\nnow, many state labor agencies are recommending that applicants wait until\ntheir agency announces that their system has incorporated CARES Act changes\nbefore they reapply. UI experts estimate that it will take a minimum of two to\nthree weeks to do so.\n\n## **How to help the industry right now**\n\nIn our interviews with workers, managers, and owners in the food and beverage\nindustry, we asked for their ideas on what forms of support would be most\nhelpful. We organized their responses into three basic categories that should\nbe the focus of policymakers moving forward.\n\n  * **Facilitate fast and adequate implementation of the relief packages**. Even in the absence of a crisis, the country\u2019s UI system tends to be [very complicated](https://research.upjohn.org/up_press/249/) and difficult for unemployed workers to navigate. The typical eligibility rules [exclude many workers](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/reports/2016/06/16/138492/strengthening-unemployment-protections-in-america/), and each state has different system, which are now largely automated and often [antiquated](http://www.itsc.org/pages/ui-it-mod.aspx), so it can be hard to obtain staff assistance. The changes to UI under the CARES Act will be extremely challenging for federal agencies and state governments to implement in the midst of this crisis, so they will need more support. At the legislative level, designing a nationally consistent solution that minimizes confusion and streamlines implementation will help.\n  * **Act quickly to save small businesses.** Owners expressed concern about whether the new small business loan program could be implemented before a rash of establishments permanently close. States and local jurisdictions should consider bridge programming such as Indiana\u2019s [Rapid Response fund](https://www.response.indychamber.com/loans) to get immediate support to businesses and encourage them to treat layoffs as a last resort through alternatives such as work sharing, also known as [short-time compensation](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/how-we-use-powerful-tool-flatten-unemployment-curve/).\n  * **Address the lack of health coverage during the pandemic (and beyond)**. The federal relief packages passed so far do not include health insurance options (other than those already available, such as Medicaid). Millions of Americans in the food and beverage industry never had health insurance or will lose employer-provided coverage before the end of April.\n  * **Address the lack of paid sick leave**. We have yet to address the lack of paid sick leave for many individuals who cannot work due to quarantines, family care responsibilities, or contracting COVID-19. This also holds true for undocumented workers.\n  * **Minimize the impact of coronavirus on personal debt levels**. Given the [disproportionate debt burden](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/size-and-scope-of-consumer-debt/) borne by low-income Americans (such as auto loans and medical debt), we can anticipate that individuals experiencing income loss from COVID-19 will have trouble paying what they owe. This crisis may compound their debt and expose them to other negative consequences from nonpayment if they cannot access available relief programs.\n  * **Consider rent and mortgage freezes.**[Housing-related debt](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/07/12/charts-of-the-week-americans-wealth-and-debt/) (either lease debt or mortgage debt) is a typical American\u2019s largest expense. [Temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/what-to-do-if-you-cant-make-your-rent-or-mortgage-payments.html) may keep people in their homes for now, but they do not reduce overall rent or mortgage obligations for [many reasons](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/25/halting-evictions-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-isnt-as-good-as-it-sounds/). Most businesses also owe rent. Many people we spoke to in the industry believed that suspending both commercial and residential rent would be the most helpful immediate solution.\n  * **Adjust future stimulus checks for costs of living.** The CARES Act authorizes a $1,200 check to every adult who earns less than $75,000 per year (scaling down to zero for higher-earning workers\u2014calculate your check amount [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/)). The workers, managers, and owners that we spoke to said that $1,200 checks are a good start. However, because payments are not adjusted for areas with a high cost of living and because we are unsure how long the crisis will continue, workers fear that $1,200 will not be enough. One owner described them as \u201ca Band-Aid on a gunshot wound.\u201d\n\n## **Saving the industry is a collective action** ****\n\nEconomic hardship and insecurity have already begun to manifest in the lives\nof food and beverage industry workers and business owners. State and local\nadministrators have been working overtime to do the best they can, but the\nreality is that a crisis of this scale will require an all-hands-on-deck\nsolution, in which everybody who has the means to help should do so.\n\nPhilanthropy, corporations, and wealthy donors can play a key role in\nproviding funding to boost immediate response efforts and awareness of\navailable support to those who are most heavily impacted. For instance, some\ninternet service providers are offering [free or low-cost internet\nservice](https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19) during the pandemic. Some\nrestaurants and wealthy individuals have set up crowdfunding and social media\ncampaigns to donate cash to unemployed restaurant workers.\n\nMany community-based organizations, food banks, job centers, training\nproviders, and other organizations are ramping up their virtual and telephone\naccess to food delivery, health care, employment, and training needs. However,\nthey too will probably need time and additional resources to get systems fully\nonline and new operating modes in place to meet crisis levels of demand.\n\nSome resources are emerging to help jobless workers navigate relief systems,\nincluding UI. For example, overloaded state systems have led to a surge in\noutside portals for support and information, such as this [one on\nReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)\nor this [one-on-one\nassistance](https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/covid-19-resources/one-on-\nones) option for gig workers.\n\nEmployers that need to resort to layoffs can consult resources about [how to\ncommunicate](https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-\nlead-to-layoffs) bad news to their workforce in a way that is respectful and\ninformative. Many of the workers that we interviewed reported a lack of\ncommunication or explanation about why management felt that they needed to\nresort to layoffs.\n\nAbove all, the U.S. needs to take stock of its safety net during this crisis\nand make sure it aligns with the value that our small businesses and service\nindustry workers bring to the economy. \u201cI don\u2019t see a huge push by anyone to\nbe a voice for people in the service industry,\u201d one owner told us. \u201cThese are\nthe hardest hit\u2014the people that everybody takes for granted.\u201d\n\nThe future of the food and beverage industry is uncertain, but it is very\nclear that the people who work in it are suffering immensely right now, and\nrequire unprecedented reassurance and relief.\n\n\u201cIt has killed me to do all this,\u201d one owner said after he described laying\noff almost his entire staff. \u201cIt made me cry. It\u2019s making me cry again. You\nthink you have everything in hand, and, then\u2026It\u2019s too hard to put it to\nreason. It\u2019s just so weird. Who knows? So, I worry about everyone.\u201d __\n\n_The authors wish to extend special thanks to the owners, managers, servers,\nand bartenders in the food and beverage industry who took the time to share\ntheir experiences and perspectives with us._\n\n## Related Content\n\n[ ![FILE PHOTO: Cyclists ride through a nearly empty Times Square in Manhattan\nduring the coronavirus disease \\(COVID-19\\) outbreak in the Brooklyn borough\nof New York City, New York, U.S., March 31, 2020.

These programs are fast-moving and updating quickly. Here\nare some of the most current details of what\u2019s in the relief package and how\nto apply for assistance.\n\n**Economic Injury Disaster Loans and Loan Advances**  \nSmall-business owners in the U.S. can apply for an Economic Injury Disaster\nLoan (EIDL) of up to $2 million through the Small Business Association (SBA).\nThe loans have low fixed interest rates of 3.75% and a long-term repayment\nschedule of up to 30 years.\n\n![table work](/media/31423/tablework-616.jpg)\n\nThe loans are meant for small businesses with 500 or fewer employees.\nIndividuals who operate as sole proprietors or independent contractors are\nalso eligible. To qualify, businesses must have been directly affected by\nCOVID-19.\n\nAs part of the EIDL loans, the SBA is giving out loan advances (essentially\nemergency grants) of up to $10,000 that would be deposited into a business\u2019\naccount within three days of applying. The grant money is to be used for\nthings like rent or mortgage payments, maintaining payroll during business\ndisruptions or slowdowns, and meeting increased costs to obtain materials\nunavailable due to interrupted supply chains.\n\nYou can apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan through the SBA\n[here](https://covid19relief.sba.gov/).\n\n**Paycheck Protection Program Loans**  \nThese loans are meant to incentivize businesses to keep their workers on staff\nby providing small businesses with loans of up to $10 million for payroll and\ncertain other expenses. If the employees are kept on payroll for eight weeks,\nthe SBA will forgive the portion of the loans used for payroll, rent, mortgage\ninterest or utilities. Up to 100% of the loan is forgivable; however, if you\nalso received an emergency grant through the EIDL program, it will reduce the\namount of the paycheck loan that\u2019s eligible for forgiveness.\n\nThe paycheck loans are for businesses with 500 or fewer employees. Sole\nproprietors, the self-employed and independent contractors are eligible.\n\nPaycheck Protection loans don\u2019t come directly from the SBA. Instead, you would\ngo through an individual lender qualified to make one of the SBA-guaranteed\nloans. The $350 billion set aside for these loans is not yet available, though\nit should be within the coming days and weeks. To prepare for applying, you\nshould calculate your total payroll costs, including benefits, and your\nutility costs.\n\nNav, a company that assists businesses in managing their finances and credit,\nhas put together a calculator on its website to help companies determine how\nmuch money they\u2019re likely to qualify for. Try it\n[here](https://www.nav.com/cares-act-sba-loan-calculator/).\n\nLoan payments will be deferred for six months, and no collateral or personal\nguarantees are required. The loans have a maturity of two years and an\ninterest rate of 1%, with the idea that most businesses would be applying for\nforgiveness before then. Lenders began taking applications Friday, April 3,\nthough applications for the self-employed and independent contractors don't\nopen until April 10.\n\nBy the end of the day on Friday, April 3, the program had issued more than\n13,000 loans valued at more than $4.3 billion, according to the SBA.\n\n**Get Outside Help**  \nThese new loan programs should be a tremendous help for promotional products\ncompanies navigating through tough times. There\u2019s a lot of fine print and\nmoving parts involved in applying. It\u2019s a good idea to seek out professional\nhelp. If you don\u2019t have a lawyer, you may be able to take advantage of a new\nprogram set up by the Lawyers for Good Government Foundation (L4GG). The\nnonprofit network of more than 125,000 legal advocates has launched a Small\nBusiness Remote Legal Clinic, offering pro bono legal consultations for small\nbusiness owners to help them understand the options available under the\nCOVID-19 stimulus package and other grant and loan programs.\n\nQualifying small businesses with 25 or fewer employees will be offered free\n45-minute consultations with pro bono attorneys who can answer legal questions\nand help owners determine the best path forward for their businesses. You can\nsign up [here](https://www.lawyersforgoodgovernment.org/covid-smallbusiness)\nto be notified when a clinic is available near you.\n\n__\n\n#### Get the best of Counselor Promogram delivered right to your inbox.\nSubscribe to our newsletter.\n\n__\n\nPlease enter name\n\n__\n\nPlease enter email Please enter valid email\n\n__\n\nPlease enter Company Name\n\nSubscribe\n\n### Related Articles\n\n**[4imprint Says Orders Down\n80%](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/4imprint-says-orders-down-80/\n\"4imprint Says Orders Down 80%\")**\n\n**[ASI Offers Free, Virtual Children\u2019s\nActivities](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/asi-offers-free-virtual-\nchildren-s-activities/ \"ASI Offers Free, Virtual Children\u2019s Activities\")**\n\n**[Final Four Merch Goes to\nNonprofits](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/final-four-merch-goes-to-\nnonprofits/ \"Final Four Merch Goes to Nonprofits\")**\n\n**[Paycheck Loan Program Off to Bumpy\nStart](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/paycheck-loan-program-off-to-\nbumpy-start/ \"Paycheck Loan Program Off to Bumpy Start\")**\n\n**[Suppliers, Distributors Band Together During\nPandemic](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/suppliers-distributors-band-\ntogether-during-pandemic/ \"Suppliers, Distributors Band Together During\nPandemic\")**\n\n**[Cybersecurity for Remote\nWorkers](/news/newsletters/promogram/april-2020/cybersecurity-for-remote-\nworkers/ \"Cybersecurity for Remote Workers\")**\n\n### Sponsored Articles\n\n[ **How to Provide Full-Color Decoration for Any Client Project**\n](/news/sponsoredby/same-day-tees/how-to-provide-full-color-decoration-for-\nany-client-project/ \"How to Provide Full-Color Decoration for Any Client\nProject\")\n\n[ **Quiz: Which Sun Protectant Promo Is Right for Your Client?**\n](/news/sponsoredby/raining-rose/quiz-which-sun-protectant-promo-is-right-for-\nyour-client/ \"Quiz: Which Sun Protectant Promo Is Right for Your Client?\")\n\n[ **Polos Go Next-Gen** ](/news/sponsoredby/trimark/polos-go-next-gen/ \"Polos\nGo Next-Gen\")\n\n[ **Infographic: Ideal Decoration Methods for Top Apparel Types**\n](/news/sponsoredby/citadel-brands-llc/infographic-ideal-decoration-methods-\nfor-top-apparel-types/ \"Infographic: Ideal Decoration Methods for Top Apparel\nTypes\")\n\n[ **6 Sales Opportunities for Promotional Coloring Books**\n](/news/sponsoredby/fields-manufacturing/6-sales-opportunities-for-\npromotional-coloring-books/ \"6 Sales Opportunities for Promotional Coloring\nBooks\")\n\n[ **5 Reasons Made\u2013in\u2013the\u2013USA Manufacturing Matters**\n](/news/sponsoredby/ameramark/5-reasons-made-in-the-usa-manufacturing-matters/\n\"5 Reasons Made\u2013in\u2013the\u2013USA Manufacturing Matters\")\n\n### Related Tags\n\n  * [Industry Trends](/news/tag?category=Trends&name=Industry+Trends)\n  * [Coronavirus](/news/tag?category=Trends&name=Coronavirus)\n\nX\n\n#### Thank You\n\n**Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.**\n\nYou have been successfully added to our mailing list, keeping you up-to-date\nwith our latest news.\n\n### More on ASI\n\n  * [About ASI](/member-benefits/about-asi \"About ASI\")\n  * [Join ASI](/member-benefits/join \"Join ASI\")\n  * [ASI Careers](/asicareers \"ASI Careers\")\n  * [Industry Jobs](/industry-jobs \"Promotional Industry Jobs\")\n  * [_ASI Shows_ & Events](/events \"ASI Shows and Events\")\n  * [Access ESP](/umbraco/Surface/RedirectSurface/OpenApplication?code=WESP \"Access ESP- Promotional Product Sourcing Tool\")\n\n  * [ASI Business Savings](/business-savings \"ASI Business Savings\")\n  * [Purchase ASI Products & Services](https://store.asicentral.com \"Purchase ASI Products and Services\")\n  * [Press](/news/press \"ASI and promotional Product Industry News\")\n  * [Support](/contact-us \"ASI Support\")\n  * [Membresia\\ASI](/member-benefits/membresia-asi \"ASI International Information\")\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/adspecialtyinstitute \"Advertising Specialty Institute Facebook\")\n  * [](https://twitter.com/asicentral \"ASICentral Twitter\")\n  * [](http://www.youtube.com/user/asicentral \"ASICentral YouTube\")\n  * [](http://www.linkedin.com/company/asi \"Advertising Specialty Institute LinkedIn\")\n  * [](http://www.instagram.com/asicentral \"ASICentral Instagram\")\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/asicentral \"Advertising Specialty Institute Pinterest\")\n\n  * [\n\nTim Andrews Blog\n\n](/news/blogs/tims-blog/ \"ASI Tim Andrews Blog\")\n\n### Contact Us\n\n  * [__\n\nBucks County Technology Park  \n4800 Street Road  \nTrevose, PA 19053\n\n](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Advertising+Specialty+Institute/@40.1370601,-74.9860227,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c6ad5f4218765f:0x85d3bd437f6b8a69\n\"ASI Address\")\n\n  * __\n\n(800) 546-1350\n\n  * [__\n\nEmail Us\n\n](mailto:customerservice@asicentral.com \"Email ASI\")\n\n  * __\n\nChat with Us\n\n\u00a92020, The Advertising Specialty Institute\u00ae.

(Photo courtesy of Sarah Rennier)\n\nWashington University\u2019s effort to help the St. Louis community starts with the\nmore than 1,700 primary care and specialist physicians of the School of\nMedicine. Many already are treating confirmed cases of COVID-19 while others\nare volunteering to take on new clinical roles as cases continue to mount.\n\n\u201cWe surveyed our faculty members and the response was breathtaking, with more\nthan 700 faculty members willing to step outside their regular areas of\npractice to help where they are most needed,\u201d said David H. Perlmutter, MD,\nexecutive vice chancellor for medical affairs and the George and Carol Bauer\nDean of the School of Medicine. Since then, he added, \u201ceven more members of\nthe faculty have stepped up, volunteering to potentially cover different units\nin the hospital, ambulatory clinics and/or the emergency department when\nneeded.\u201d\n\nScores of [students](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/04/medical-campus-students-\nmobilize-to-help-health-care-workers-community/) on the Washington University\nMedical Campus have mobilized to support their faculty mentors. They are\nreviewing emerging academic research on COVID-19 to save care providers\nvaluable time; managing a coronavirus email \u201chotline\u201d; and providing child\ncare to health-care workers. They also have manufactured more than 1,600 face\nshields and soon will deliver meals to infected and at-risk community members\nthrough [St. Louis Food Angels](https://www.stlouisfoodangels.com/), an\naffiliate of [Sling Health.](https://slinghealth.org/)\n\nHaley Sherburne, a first-year medical student interested in pediatrics, is\namong the 170 students who have volunteered to provide child care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just beginning my journey as a clinician and cannot actively participate\nin the treatment of those affected by COVID-19,\u201d said Sherburne, whose child-\ncare experience includes working with terminally ill children as well as those\nwith cognitive and physical disabilities. \u201cBut I can help health-care workers\nserve the urgent needs of our patients, knowing that their children are safe\nand cared for by capable and compassionate volunteers.\u201d\n\nThe Danforth Campus\u2019 Charles F. Knight Executive Education and Conference\nCenter, which isn\u2019t open to regular guests at this time, is providing rooms\nand meals to health-care providers who don\u2019t want to return home between\nshifts, either to avoid the risk of spreading the virus to their families or\ndue to travel distance.\n\n\u201cOne guest told us that he had been basically living in his garage to protect\na child with an underlying health issue,\u201d said Peter Arscott, the general\nmanager. \u201cThese doctors and nurses are making incredible sacrifices to help\nour community. We\u2019re just grateful we can give back a little.\u201d\n\n**Supporting our local economy**\n\n[![](https://source.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/002-med-meal-\ndelivery-300x237.jpg)](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/04/washington-university-\ncomes-together-to-support-the-st-louis-community/002-med-meal-\ndelivery/)Washington University partners with Park Central Development and the\nKindness Meals Program to deliver meals to medical workers at Barnes-Jewish\nand Children\u2019s hospitals. (Photo courtesy of Park Central Development)\n\nWashington University also is finding ways to support the local economy as\nbusinesses shutter and jobs disappear. First and foremost, university leaders\nhave kept all of the university\u2019s 16,500 employees and contractors on the\npayroll and honored the contracts of all nonsalaried undergraduate, graduate\nand contract workers.\n\n\u201cWe understood that many businesses in our region would be forced to lay off\nworkers and that those job cuts would ripple across the local economy,\u201d said\nHenry S. Webber, executive vice chancellor and chief administrative officer.\n\u201cWe continue to do all we can to support our employees and their families.\u201d\n\nUniversity faculty also are reaching out to help local organizations. For\ninstance, Brown School faculty and staff are providing [free professional\ndevelopment](https://brownschool.wustl.edu/Resources-and-\nInitiatives/Professional-Development/Pages/Free-Professional-Development-\nResources.aspx) opportunities to local nonprofits.\n\nIn addition, the university donated $100,000 to the [St. Louis Community\nFoundation](https://stlgives.org/), including $50,000 for the Regional\nResponse Fund in support of local nonprofit organizations delivering services\nto people affected by the virus; and another $50,000 for the Gateway\nResiliency Fund, which provides short-term monetary relief to employees and\nowners of businesses that are affected by closures and other circumstances\nrelated to COVID-19.\n\nAnd Peter Boumgarden, professor of practice, strategy and organizations at\nOlin Business School, is helping restaurant owners understand the federal\nstimulus package.\n\nAnd then there are the burgers. Washington University is purchasing more than\n1,500 meals every week from gastro pubs, sandwich shops and ethnic eateries in\nthe Delmar Loop and Central West End for employees at the School of Medicine,\nFacilities, Information Technology and the Washington University Police\nDepartment.\n\n\u201cSt. Louis restaurants are among the best in the nation, and we\u2019re doing our\npart to help them survive one to-go order at a time,\u201d said Jodie Lloyd, senior\nanalyst in the executive vice chancellor for administration\u2019s office.\n\n**Keeping our community safe**\n\nWhen Washington University infectious disease and public health experts speak,\nregional leaders listen, especially Chancellor Martin. Washington University\nwas among the first local institutions to institute remote working in mid-\nMarch and implement strict social distancing policies for those employees\nstill deployed on campus.\n\nThe university\u2019s Institute for Public Health also has been a vital resource\nfor local officials as they try to make data-informed decisions about the\nregion\u2019s health. Researchers have developed a model to forecast the growth of\ncases and are studying the possible impacts of shelter-in-place policies on\nindividuals vulnerable to domestic violence.\n\nIn addition, the Center for Community Health Partnership and Research is\nworking with the St. Louis Department of Health, Immigrant Service Providers\nNetwork and BJC HealthCare to help immigrants understand and cope with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Christopher Prater, MD, assistant professor of medicine and\nof pediatrics, said many immigrants have witnessed epidemics in their home\ncountries to which St. Louisans can only now relate.\n\n\u201cIt is very likely that their fear may be escalated because they have seen the\ndisastrous effects of outbreaks in settings of limited medical resources,\u201d\nsaid Prater, who has been a primary care physician for St. Louis\u2019 immigrants\nand refugees for three years. \u201cWe cannot forget that many of our immigrant\nneighbors have seen deaths from diarrhea outbreaks, multi-drug resistant\ntuberculosis and measles.\n\n\u201cBut worse yet,\u201d Prater said, \u201cthey have perhaps seen loved ones die from\npneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections, a leading cause of death\nglobally, and the very reason why COVID-19 is causing mortality in 2020 in\neven the most heavily resourced medical systems.\u201d\n\n**Helping where needed**\n\n[![student with mask](https://source.wustl.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/HanJuMask-300x195.jpg)](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/04/washington-\nuniversity-comes-together-to-support-the-st-louis-\ncommunity/hanjumask/)Inspired by her \u201cPositive Psychology\u201d class, senior Han\nJu Seo is sewing some 1,000 masks. (Photo courtesy of Seo)\n\nWashington University senior Han Ju Seo can\u2019t treat COVID-19 patients or model\nthe spread of the virus or write a big check to a local food pantry. But she\ncan operate a sewing machine. So Seo bought fabric and thread and got to work\nsewing 1,000 masks for the St. Louis community.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment when I decided that I could either eat ice cream and be\nsad that graduation was canceled or I could do something to help,\u201d said Seo,\nwho is majoring in psychology in Arts & Sciences. Seo said she was inspired by\nstudies in positive psychology with Tim Bono, a lecturer in psychological and\nbrain sciences and an assistant dean in Arts & Sciences.  \n\nSeo is just one of many students and alumni who have stepped up to serve the\nSt. Louis community. Other students are helping St. Louis children as well as\nfood-insecure and isolated seniors.\n\nLily Xu, a senior studying biomedical engineering at the McKelvey School of\nEngineering, and Alex Hu, a senior studying chemistry in Arts & Sciences,\nleveraged their experience with the Campus Y to launch [Learning\nLodge](http://www.learninglodge.org/), which is offering online tutoring to\nlocal elementary and high school students. So far, some 70 Washington\nUniversity undergraduates have joined their effort.\n\nSt. Louis-based [alumni businesses](https://fuse.wustl.edu/washu-\nentrepreneurs-respond-to-coronavirus/) also are serving local students.\nVarsity Tutors, founded by alumnus Chuck Cohn (BSBA \u201908), [launched a new\nservice called Virtual School Day](https://fuse.wustl.edu/varsity-tutors-\nlaunches-virtual-school-day-amid-covid-19-school-closings/), which offers more\nthan 20 hours of live, online classes across a variety of core subjects for\nK-12 students.

This upgrade primarily reflects\nan upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful\nforces impacting stock\nprices.%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aclaris-acrs-upgraded-to-\nbuy%3A-heres-why-2020-04-06)\n\nInvestors might want to bet on Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS), as it has been\nrecently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an\nupward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces\nimpacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The\nsystem tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS\nestimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current\nand following years.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price\nmovements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual\ninvestors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating\nupgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective\nfactors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Aclaris is essentially a positive\ncomment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its\nstock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings\nestimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven\nto be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of\ninstitutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for\ncalculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in\nearnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower\nfair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.\nTheir transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for\nthe stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating\nupgrade for Aclaris imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.\nInvestors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by\npushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings\nestimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly\nrewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision.\nHere is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an\nimportant role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate\nrevisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to\nearnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks\nRank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive\nexternally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an\naverage annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see [the complete list of\ntoday's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\n>>>>](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-list/?ADID=zp_1link&ICID=zpi%20_1link).\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Aclaris\n\nThis specialty pharmaceutical company is expected to earn -$1.30 per share for\nthe fiscal year ending December 2020, which represents a year-over-year change\nof 66.7%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aclaris. Over the past\nthree months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased\n13.9%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to\nbe weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system\nmaintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire\nuniverse of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time.

Following today's presentation, we will conduct\na question-and-answer session. Each analyst should limit themselves to only\ntwo questions. [Operator Instructions] At the request of Greenbrier Companies,\nthis conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes.\n\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts,\nVice President and Treasurer. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.\n\n**Justin M. Roberts** -- _Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer_\n\nThank you, Misty. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter of\nfiscal 2020 conference call. On today's call, I'm joined by Greenbrier's\nChairman and CEO, Bill Furman; Lorie Tekorius, President and COO; and Adrian\nDownes, Senior Vice President and CFO. They will provide an update on\nGreenbrier's near-term priorities as we manage to the COVID-19 pandemic. And\nthen we will discuss the results for the second quarter. Following our\nintroductory remarks, we will open up the call for questions. In addition to\nthe press release issued this morning, which includes supplemental data,\nadditional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide\npresentation posted today on the IR section of our website.\n\nMatters discussed on today's conference call includes forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995. Throughout our discussion today, we will describe some of the\nimportant factors that could cause Greenbrier's actual results in 2020 and\nbeyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking\nstatement made by or on behalf of Greenbrier.\n\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Bill.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThank you, Justin and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I want to take a\nmoment to extend good wishes for the health of everyone on the line with us\ntoday. I also call out the work of the many health professionals, emergency\nresponders, government officials and individuals who are on the frontlines\nbattling this pandemic and those in our armed forces and National Guard around\nthe world and here in America.\n\nFinally, I thank all the Greenbrier employees in our factories, offices and at\nhome, each now operating under essential industry status. The world is not\nonly in a severe health crisis, but obviously an economic crisis affecting\nbusinesses differently. As you will hear today, the ability to continue to\noperate our factories with a strong backlog in hand allows us to protect\nliquidity and maneuver in a way other industries and other businesses cannot\nunder current circumstances.\n\nWe're now operating under two essential priorities. Number one, to provide for\nthe safety and security of our workforce. And number two, to provide for the\nliquidity and economic wellbeing of the enterprise and its shareholders. In\nthe face of this pandemic, management priorities and behavior immediately\nshifted to the extraordinary challenges at hand. We quickly implemented\ncontingency plans and assembled incident response teams. We assessed the risk\nto our business in real time and are taking swift actions to ensure Greenbrier\nis defensively positioned to manage through a period that presents a range of\nunknown and unknowable challenges.\n\nWe're safely operating, and I emphasize safely operating, all our\nmanufacturing and essential service sites, including those sites that manage\nover a quarter of industry railcar in the United States and North America.\nGreenbrier's operations constitute essential infrastructure and essential\nbusinesses as defined by the US Department of Homeland Security and other US\nand international agencies, including all stay-at-home orders issued in the\njurisdictions where we operate at home and abroad.\n\nGreenbrier supports operations vital to the national transportation system to\nDepartment of Defense and other federal agencies. We perform our functions\nunder the statutory and regulatory authority of the Department of\nTransportation, Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Railroad\nAdministration, and under the Jones Act in our marine operations. Accordingly,\nGreenbrier will help maintain the delivery of vital goods including food,\nmedical supplies and fuel to communities in the United States, and then all\nthe nations that we supply around the world. We will keep our nations and\nthose nations smoothly functioning in the railroad system.\n\nAlong with the welfare of our employees, we are determined to protect the\neconomic wellbeing of the enterprise during unprecedented market and economic\nconditions. As discussed in our earnings release today, we are laser-focused\non liquidity. Our goal is to produce $1 billion in available reliable\nliquidity within the remaining five months of our fiscal year, ending in\nAugust of 2020. Before the onset of the pandemic, we had already begun to\nreduce the size of our manufacturing footprint due to anticipated lower levels\nof railcar demand and reduced aftermarket activity.\n\nAdjustments to production and staffing levels that began in September of last\nyear, continued into the second and third quarter as we idled excess capacity\nin North American manufacturing facilities, largely in Mexico as well as at\nGreenbrier Rail Services locations. Since we began this initiative, we have\nadjusted global operations through workforce reductions equal to approximately\n20% of Greenbrier's total global workforce. These reductions now exceed 3,500\nworkers.\n\nYesterday, we took steps which would add another 200 workers over time. Our\ncolleagues who left this fiscal year are people who each made important\ncontributions to our success; many have spent their entire careers in this\nbusiness. They are leaving us through no fault of their own. Each affected\nemployee is a person with a name and a family. This is a fact we never forget.\nWe recognize that this is a period of shared sacrifice. As a result, I have\ntaken a voluntary immediate reduction in my salary of $250,000; and for our\nBoard of Directors, each has voluntarily reduced their cash compensation.\n\nWe've frozen pay increases for members of management. Moreover, cash and\nearnings will automatically flow from curtailed bonus payments if we do not\nmeet targeted performance metrics and along with a discretionary reduction\nthat I work the compensation committee of the Board of Directors can request.\nAll that remains to be seen. But it is an automatic relief felt for difficult\ntimes baked in to a company that is well seasoned in dealing with difficult\ntimes in a cyclical business. This is not our first rodeo.\n\nGreenbrier's business is flexible enough to quickly adapt to changing market\nconditions. Our franchise is strong, and we hold a position as the number one\nor number two players in three core markets in South America, more\nspecifically Brazil, North America and Europe. The strength of this franchise\nis demonstrated by the fact that half of this quarter's earnings were\ngenerated from abroad -- orders, I'm not sure of earnings, but orders. And of\nthat half, about 1,000 cars are to be built in North America by a good\ncustomer in the Gulf Cooperative Council.\n\nWith the strong experienced management team, Greenbrier again has navigated\nthrough difficult markets in the past. Historically, we've come out stronger\nas a result of our combined efforts. Not only did we recover, but we\ntransformed and dramatically increased the scale of our business through hard\nwork, focus, execution, and diversification of our revenue stream. Although\nthis is a stressful time, no matter how the remainder of this year plays out,\nwe know our role in the transportation industry remains vital. Beyond layoffs\nand other obvious reductions, we're committed to take aggressive actions to\nshrink Greenbrier's cost profile, its balance sheet -- to improve its balance\nsheet, and Lorie and Adrian will speak more to this a little later.\n\nBased on our current backlog, we are left with very little open production\ncapacity for the remainder of both fiscal and the calendar year. At Gunderson,\nour marine backlog extends through fiscal year and the calendar year. Our\nbacklog at production -- current production rate stretches into 2021 and\nbeyond. A large multiyear manufacturing backlog of railcar units provides one\nsource of stability in difficult times as we operate our facilities. These\nlong-term customers are very reliable and have virtually never wavered in\nfulfilling commitments, even if they have to at times put cars in storage. All\nthat provides resilience and a bridge to an industry dynamics and economic\nconditions improve.\n\nIn addition to the liquidity goals I mentioned, we have stress tested\nGreenbrier's balance sheet to ensure our liquidity, and we have run very many\nscenarios to look at worst case. While we have suspended earnings guidance, we\nexpect to remain profitable. We do not know, nor can anyone know how this\ncrisis will evolve and resolve. Today, this is the biggest risk we all face\ntogether. Scenarios may emerge that we cannot reasonably anticipate, but we\nare confident we're managing those factors within our control and we're also\n-- to manage others through the worst of times. This means we are prepared to\nadapt to the new economic realities. We'll take the difficult and necessary\nactions to protect Greenbrier's economic base, preserve its financial\nstability, focus on our core business, remove essential [Phonetic] activities\nand restore shareholder value for years to come.\n\nNow, over to you Lorie for your comments.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nThank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll\nbriefly provide some additional detail on the quarter, although I have to\nadmit that February 29, the end of our quarter seems like a lifetime ago. The\nworld has shifted very quickly and we've pivoted to respond to the shifting\nglobal landscape. Over the last six months, we've been rationalizing\nproduction capacity and overhead in response to anticipated levels of new\nfreight, railcar demand and reduced aftermarkets activity.\n\nDemand has weakened due to macroeconomic conditions, including trade disputes,\nfaster train speeds resulting from the implementation of PSR and significantly\nlower freight rail loadings, which have dropped sequentially for almost 15\nmonths in nearly all commodity categories. The industry remains supported by a\nbacklog of over 51,000 railcars, but all builders in North America have taken\nsteps to slow production lines in 2020. It's important to note that these\nconditions were present and we were adjusting capacity prior to the COVID-19\npandemic and the collapse in global oil markets.\n\nWe continued to adjust operations as needed to ensure the long-term health of\nGreenbrier. And as a brief recap to the quarter, deliveries this quarter were\n4,500 railcars and we received orders for approximately 8,500 units valued\nover $815 million. These orders originating from our international sources\naccounted for over 50% of the activity in the quarter, and about a 1,000 of\nthose units were part of a joint international commercial effort for a\ncustomer in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will be built in and serviced to\nNorth American markets.\n\nOur backlog worldwide remains strong at 30,800 units valued at $3.2 billion.\nOperating performance at our ARI manufacturing facilities improved in the\nquarter. And our North American manufacturing group continued to perform\nprofitably, producing high quality railcars safely, even as production rates\nwere adjusted and demand declined. Our European and our Brazilian operations\nperformed as expected in Q2 and order activity was strong. Notably, we\nreceived the first multiyear order in Brazil in many years and both our\nEuropean and Brazilian operations are benefiting from some rightsizing that we\nexecuted in fiscal 2019. The continued improvement in our repair operations is\na reflection of the remedial actions taken over the last 18 months.\n\nThe Wheels & Parts operations benefited from their higher seasonal volumes,\nalthough volumes were pressured compared to past winters. And our leasing\nrevenue in the quarter included externally sourced railcar syndication\nactivity. And as a reminder, this activity caused leasing's gross margin\npercentage to be lower as a percentage of revenue than its typical 45% to 50%\nrange. Excluding the externally sourced syndication activity, our leasing\nsegment's margin percentage was 47.2%.\n\nAnd with respect to the businesses response to the COVID-19 pandemics, all\nglobal operations are currently meeting or exceeding the CDC's\nrecommendations. To protect our workforce, Greenbrier has implemented health\nscreenings including daily temperature readings, operating through split\nshifts, enhanced social distancing, and expanded deep cleaning at all\nlocations. We're operating under a dual mandate of maintaining business\ncontinuity alongside ensuring employee health and welfare. As an essential\nbusiness that supports global infrastructure, Greenbrier's dedicated to\nfulfilling its role to facilitate the continued stability of the\ntransportation supply network.\n\nGreenbrier and its employees take the responsibility of helping to ensure the\ndelivery of vital goods including food, medical supplies and fuel to\ncommunities very seriously. As you heard from Bill, in addition to ensuring\nthe business continues to operate, we are focused on increasing liquidity.\nThis will be accomplished through a variety of actions including eliminating\nnonessential capital expenditures, aggressively reducing our overheads and\ngeneral and administrative expenses and evaluating other strategic actions. We\nexpect to come through the current crisis a stronger, more resilient\nGreenbrier. As a management team, we remain confident in the long-term\nstrategy developed with our Board of Directors but are focused on executing\nthe near-term priorities that Bill described.\n\nNow, over to you, Adrian.\n\n**Adrian J. Downes** -- _Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and\nChief Financial Officer_\n\nThank you, Lorie, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, quarterly\nfinancial information is available in the press release and supplemental\nslides on our website. Highlights for the second quarter include revenue of\n$624 million and deliveries of 4,500 units, which includes 800 units in\nBrazil; aggregate gross margin of 13.8%; the quarter included a contract\nmodification payment of $9.2 million net of tax, which strengthened our\nbacklog and profitability. A hallmark of Greenbrier is the flexibility to find\nwin-win solutions to our customers' needs.\n\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $13.6 million or $0.41 per share,\nexcluding approximately $1.7 million net of tax or $0.05 per share of\nintegration related expenses, adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier\nof $15.3 million or $0.46 per share and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was\n$71.6 million or 11.5% of revenue. We successfully achieved $4.3 million of\npre-tax cost synergies related to the ARI acquisition in the quarter and $7.1\nmillion year-to-date. Because of the current uncertainties and shifting\npriorities, we are not reaffirming our synergy targets of $15 million in\nfiscal 2020 at this time, although we will continue to work towards this\ntarget.\n\nTotal liquidity at February 29 was $620 million, which includes $170 million\nof cash, and we have no significant debt maturities until late 2023. As you\nheard on the call already, we are working to significantly expand liquidity,\nthrough a variety of actions with a target of $1 billion. We are also in the\nprocess of examining the various governmental programs available to Greenbrier\nand our employees, including programs like the payroll tax deferral provision\nand employee friendly modifications of existing employee funds as a result of\nthe CARES Act. We plan to utilize these to the fullest extent possible where\nbeneficial.\n\nAlso Read:  United Technologies\u2019 Q3 results beat\nexpectations](https://news.alphastreet.com/united-technologies-utx-\nearnings-q3-2019/)\n\nGreenbrier's Board of Directors remains committed to a balance deployment of\ncapital to protect our business and simultaneously create long-term\nshareholder value. Greenbrier has declared a quarterly dividend for 24\nconsecutive orders with periodic increases. Today, we're announcing a dividend\nof $0.27 per share, which represents a yield of 7.5% based on yesterday's\nclosing stock price. As announced in our earnings release, we are suspending\nour prior guidance for the year. Greenbrier's management team has a long\nhistory of managing through volatile times. While the COVID-19 pandemic is\nwithout precedent and has created significant uncertainty on a global basis,\nwe remain convinced that the proactive actions we have taken so far and the\nplanned actions we have described today will position the Company for long-\nterm strength.\n\nNow, we'll open the call for questions.\n\n## Questions and Answers:\n\n**Operator**\n\nIt is now time for the question-and-answer session of today's call. [Operator\nInstructions] First question comes from Justin Long. Your line is open.\n\n**Justin Long** -- _Stephens Inc. -- Analyst_\n\nThanks. Good morning and appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe to start\njust bigger picture on the industry and what's anticipating from a railcar\nproduction standpoint, FTR has recently lowered their forecast for 2020 and\n2021, so that our low to mid 20,000 units range. I'm curious as you think\nabout kind of cutting back your capacity and some of the things you discussed\nin the prepared remarks. Is that the type of build rate from an industry\nperspective that you're planning on or do you anticipate any upside or\ndownside to that? And then also if you could just talk about cancellation risk\nin the backlog or deferral risk in the backlog, curious if you've seen any if\nthat play out the last month or so?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nSure. So, I'll start out and I'm sure that Bill will supplement. Good morning,\nJustin. It's nice to hear your voice. From an industry outlook perspective,\nFTR certainly has gone through several iterations of dropping expected\ndeliveries in 2020 and 2021. Right now, with everything that's going on, I\nthink it is really hard to say specifically what deliveries might look like\nthe next couple of years. I think, it certainly is reasonable that the numbers\nthat they're projecting might be the numbers as you look across the years.\nAbsolutely there is upside. We've seen that historically in our markets where\nwe can be predicting that the sky is falling, and then the next thing is\nsomething wonderful happens. That's one of the things that we believe our\nmanagement team and our manufacturing group in particular is very good at is\nbeing responsive to when opportunities present themselves. Our commercial team\nis very focused on working closely with our customers and remaining flexible\nso that we can take advantage of those opportunities. So, that's why you see\nus slow in production as opposed to stopping it all together. If we can\ncontinue at a fairly slow rate, we think that gives us optionality.\n\nAnd then turning to your second question about risk in the backlog, we -- as\nwe've poured through the backlog and looking at the different car types that\nwe're building and it is a broad variety of car types, at this point in time,\nwe don't have anything that we're overly concerned about, but then again, how\ncan you work in this point in time and not be overly concerned about\nsomething. I think, we have a good history of working closely with our\ncustomers if there is an issue that they raise or a concern that we may need\nto modify car types or look at delivery timing. But again, at this point in\ntime, we're feeling like our backlog is a very solid position and a good\nindicator of future activities.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThe only thing I would add, and thank you for your question, is that obviously\nwe've had a number of things occur, Lorie mentioned a few. But the oil market\nvolatility is of concern, not only for the chemical and oil by rail business,\nbut -- and while Greenbrier doesn't have a strong sand concentration, many of\nour investors, institutional investors, for whom we manage cars, do. So, we're\nvery focused on that. But, we're not seeing cancellations in the sense you\nmean it there. Obviously, the qualitative aspect of the portfolio is another\nthing. But, I think, the kind of nimbleness our commercial team showed in this\ndeal that was done to work with a customer do not only improve our backlog but\nimprove our profitability and draw immediate cash flow is something that we'll\ntry to do more of in the future. And we have great customers. We think things\nare going to -- the backlog is the strongest thing we've got, plus the fact\nthat we can operate our factories under the essential service rules.\n\n**Justin Long** -- _Stephens Inc. -- Analyst_\n\nOkay. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then second question I had was on\nSG&A. I get the suspension of guidance totally understandable in this type of\nenvironment. But when you look at the things you can control and you think\nabout some of the headcount reductions that you've seen. Is there any clarity\nyou can give us on what you're expecting for SG&A this year or what's getting\nbaked into the comment you made Bill, that you expect to remain profitable.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nLorie, you should address that. I think we want to be cautious about through a\nnumbers out there. As I said, we expect to be profitable manufacturing\noperations are particularly resilient. We do expect to have a G&A instructions\nin all categories. G&A reductions I mean, so I just going to be factored\npeople we already had, but I don't think, I don't know what you would like to\nsay about it Lorie.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nThank you, Bill. That was a good lead in. We are looking across the board. We\ndon't take lightly the number of production workers that we've had to let go\nover the last six months. So, I would say, while we're not willing to put a\nspecific target out there since we are suspending guidance. I would say that\nit's going to be double digit percentage reduction is going to be the goal in\nour SG&A, coupled with looking at overhead costs, which are some of the things\nthat oftentimes can get overlooked. But, as we're resizing our manufacturing\nfootprint, particularly here in North America, there are overhead types of\nactivities that can also be scaled down.\n\nSo, that's where we're pleased that our manufacturing margins have remained in\nthe double digits. We believe that's because we do know how to scale our\nworkforce, both the line workers as well as the overhead to adjust, to reduce\nproduction rates. And you will be seeing some reductions in SG&A headcount as\nwell some of the other things that Bill mentioned regarding his compensation,\nthe Board compensation, clearly travel restrictions, the way that they've\nplayed out. That's going to have a big impact on SG&A going forward. We have a\nhiring freeze and we'll be looking at other areas where we can call back some\ncost.\n\n**Justin Long** -- _Stephens Inc. -- Analyst_\n\nThanks. That's really helpful. Good luck out there. I know it's fast, but stay\nhealthy and talk soon.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nThank you, Justin.\n\n**Operator**\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Allison Poliniak. Your line is open.\n\n**Allison Poliniak** -- _Wells Fargo -- Analyst_\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Lorie, I just want to follow on that train of thought.\nObviously, you guys were addressing operations to begin with trying to fix and\nsupport some of them. As you step back, I know it's probably hard today\nbecause you're just dealing with the general sort of impact, as on a daily\nbasis. But, can you maybe comment in terms of what you think you can do\nstructurally to support the foundation and make Greenbrier obviously much\nstronger coming out of this? I mean, are you guys even thinking of that at\nthis point?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nAbsolutely, we're thinking about, when we come out of this COVID-19 focus\nright now trying to make, particularly, our core operations and manufacturing\nin our commercial group a lot stronger. I think one of the very interesting\nthings about the pandemic is, it is forcing us to rethink how we work if you,\n-- I think you've been here in our offices and Lake Oswego Allison, it's\nreally amazing how much of our services, we can continue while probably 90% of\nour workforce helping you. So I think that will be a foundation for how we\nthink about what is going to be our core to support our operations, whether\nthe folks that we have down in Dallas, the folks that we have here in the\nPortland metropolitan area, or even our workforce and St. Charles to rethink\nhow do we use technology to build on having a solid base to support our\noperations and really thinking how do we make certain that we've got the best\nand the brightest supporting that and maybe there are some costs that we are\ngoing to realize that we don't have to continue to incur.\n\n**Allison Poliniak** -- _Wells Fargo -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. And then just -- I know you touched on Europe, obviously, closing for\ntwo weeks there. Any color on Brazil, I guess it was unclear to me because\nwe've heard some industries shutting down in Brazil today. Is there a sort of\na slip on or a stoppage there that you guys are preparing for near-term or is\nthat just business as usual in this environment, I guess?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nRight. And yes, business as usual to the extent that you can today. It is one\nof the more interesting things, because we do operate around the globe, every\ncountry seems to have a different approach and those approaches can change on\na daily basis. As I understand it today, our operations in Brazil do continue\nto operate and the government officials do encourage our employees to go to\nwork. That was probably be one of the places that we started implementing\nadditional health screening measures early on, touch wood, everything has been\ngoing just fine down there. But, we'll just continue to monitor that. We\nbelieve that we have good governmental support that transportation via the\nrail will be an essential service and our workers will continue to work. As\nyou know, we've right-sized that operation last year. So, they are able to\noperate with a fairly thin bench, and their production rates are a bit more\nmodest than you would see here in North America. So, we'll just have to watch\nand wait.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nI'd just like to emphasize that the US relationship with Brazil, current\nadministration has shown a great deal of interest in Brazil. Most of the\ncountries in the world are following US and Western, we -- on essential\nindustries. It is an essential industry in Brazil. So, much of their exports\nand their economy relies on transportation. We're the largest builder of the\nequipment we build in Brazil. So, I think Brazil and Europe, we expect those\nrules to continue in place and we're working with -- diplomatically with our\nown government to encourage that to occur.\n\n**Allison Poliniak** -- _Wells Fargo -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks. That's helpful. Stay safe everyone.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Bascome Majors. Your line is open.\n\n**Bascome Majors** -- _Susquehanna -- Analyst_\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to talk a little bit about\nthe syndication channel, that's been a really important piece of your growth\nover the last several years, and it's pretty embedded in the model now. Can\nyou give us an indication of how some of these financial buyer customers are\nyou -- of yours are responding here? And any indication of how much of the\nbacklog today was sort of slated for that channel? Thanks.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThank you, Bascome. I'll let Lorie or Adrian possibly address the last\nquestion. In general, I -- we still see a strong distribution network there. I\nthink, it's an interesting question because the railcar leasing business is\npeculiar. It's business that we have evolved to be in the leasing business. We\ncan create portfolios if will and we can also sell them in fact. I don't\nbelieve personally in borrowing short and lending long on a 40-year asset.\nThese assets as Tigerair learned long ago, North American car can come back to\nhaunt you and they can sink a ship. Our system is set up, so that we have\nleases that are quality leases and those leases can be deployed to create cash\nflow, and as you point out to create cash, margins, liquidity and extra value\nin the model we have.\n\nAs late as last week, we just closed $48 million deal with one of our existing\nportfolio companies, a leasing portfolio companies that is a loyal customer.\nAll of our customers who have multiyear agreements, including leasing\ncompanies, with whom we work closely are fulfilling their obligations. So, I\nthink that we are in good shape there. If we were relying on the ABS market or\nsomething of that nature, and where we are -- where we have partners who are\nin the fund business, they have firm commitments and nobility to have their\nfunds pulled. If we were solely in that market, I think it would be much\nweaker position. But we have a mixed bag. We're still accepting orders and we\nthink we're doing well. Lorie, do you want to talk a little bit more about\nthat?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nSure. And just doing a quick scan of our backlog detail, I would say of our\nFeb 29 backlog, probably less than 10% of it is going into syndication market\nat this point in time.\n\n**Bascome Majors** -- _Susquehanna -- Analyst_\n\nYeah. That's great news. So, it sounds like some of the build in that\ninventory was sold subsequent to quarter end in the $50 million deal you\nmentioned, Bill. Am I hearing that right?\n\nAlso Read:  Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX): Q4 2019 Earnings\nSnapshot](https://news.alphastreet.com/diana-shipping-dsx-\nstock-q4-2019-earnings-snapshot/)\n\n **William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board\nof Directors_\n\nYes.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nRight. And Bascome, as you know, when you look at that line item on our\nbalance sheet, railcars held for syndication, if you were to do some sort of a\ntrend line over for the last I don't know eight to 12 quarters, it does go\nmove up and down, not necessarily an indication of anything that's going on in\nthat particular market. But often times, it's more a result of when the cars\nare being produced and as we're packaging a variety of different car types\ntogether to put together those syndication packages.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nAnd again, the majority of those are attached to what in a normal market would\nbe money good leases. We could syndicate, sell them and receive a margin just\nfor the origination of them. Today, those are good customers, and they have\ngood five-year to seven-year, even 10-year or eight-year, cash flows attached.\nSo, we're simply in the leasing business, but in a moderate way, I'd also\npoint out that our balance sheet with that embedded in it still has a one-to-\none debt equity ratio. We have a $1.5 billion in net book value, equity,\nsetting aside our market cap. We also have the -- a very low amount of debt, I\nguess, at about a $1 billion or so. So I think, if you look at the leasing\nportfolio, in the future, we're going to have more clarity for the Street and\nfor our shareholders. We're going to still continue to try to make this more\ntransparent and cleared. The attractiveness of our systems in downturn like\nthis is far and way above those who have this leases and returning rapid --\nrapidly in rapid amounts.\n\n**Bascome Majors** -- _Susquehanna -- Analyst_\n\nThank you for the detailed answer. If I could just echo on a related question\non the funding side of that. Bill, you mentioned, in short order hoping to\nhave access to $1 billion worth of liquidity. I think you said today you're at\nabout $600 million. Can you just give us maybe a sneak peek at what you think\nthat other $400 million could look like? Thank you.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nYeah. I'm going let Lorie walk through that, unless you want me to take that,\nLorie. I could generally make some comments, capex\u2026\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nNo. I would say, I'll -- thanks, Bill and I'm sure that you'll supplement or\nAdrian can as well or Justin, our Treasurer, we've all been up to our eyeballs\nand thinking about all the various ways that we can look towards liquidity in\nthis time of uncertainty. So, capex is one of the more significant items that\nwe have already been thinking about putting on the brakes, we're putting on\nthe brakes a lot harder. If you look at what we were thinking, we would do as\nwe enter this fiscal year versus where we're saying we're going to be now, and\neven at that, I would suspect that our capex can come down further from what\nwe're showing in the 10-Q when it gets filed later today, or if you're looking\nat the supplemental slides.\n\nAnd I don't expect that when we hit August 31, it's just going -- we're going\nto flip a switch and go back to business as usual. I think that we're going to\nbe focused on really making certain that we're deploying capital in the best\nway possible from a capital -- from a property, plant and equipment\nperspective for a time to come. Additionally, like we talked about, there\nwould be overhead and G&A reductions. I would say that could be probably\nnearly as much as what we're expecting in the capex productions. Some of that\nwill take a little bit of time to get momentum. We are seeing our spending\nlevels being lower in the first half of actually this fiscal year than what we\nwere initially anticipating. Again, a lot of that comes as we were making\nadjustments to reduce production rates and lower demand.\n\nAnd the other things that we'll be looking at are what I consider strategic\ninitiatives, and some of that is looking at our existing credit facilities and\nfiguring out, there are a couple of avenues where we can access additional\ncapital under our existing credit facilities. So, these are not amendments,\nthese are not going out for new debt. This is just utilizing what we currently\nhave at our fingertips as well as evaluating our operating base.\n\n**Adrian J. Downes** -- _Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and\nChief Financial Officer_\n\nAnd that particular bucket would be fairly sizable $100 million to [Phonetic]\n$150 million, for example. There's a number of these things, we don't have --\nwe're not talking about tapping the credit markets in any unusual way. The\nmarkets are of course tightened up, and there are some markets open. We're not\nlooking at a financing, other than maybe some top off financing if we find a\ngood deal. So, if you look at all of these things, we theoretically should be\nable to go over $1 billion. But the strategic aspects of non-core businesses,\ncutting costs, conserving cash, it all starts mounting up pretty quickly. So,\nwe think the target is realistic and achievable in the next five months of\nthis year.\n\n**Bascome Majors** -- _Susquehanna -- Analyst_\n\nThank you all for the detail.\n\n**Operator**\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Ken Hoexter. Your line is open.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thanks for taking the call. Can you talk maybe,\nLorie, about base levels of production given your contracts? Usually you see a\nbounce in the second half. Is that production line capabilities or demand for\ncar types that scale in the second half? I guess, you've got to go back to\nmaybe 2013 before we saw a real weakness in that fiscal third quarter. So, I\nguess, what I'm asking is, if the backlog is so strong and ops are ongoing,\nwhat do you need to slash? Does the backlog have greater deferrals than you\ntarget? Can you cancel your own self orders? But, that kind of doesn't make\nsense, if you noted all slots were filled for production. So, maybe just talk\nabout how we should think about that railcar build going into the rest of the\nyear?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nSure. And we have been, as we said, reducing production rates. I would say\nright now in North America, we're probably maybe 75% of our theoretical\ncapacity is where we're operating. We would see that coming down maybe in\nother 5% or 10% as we exit the fiscal year and that's knowing what we know\ntoday. Obviously, there's a number of things that can change. We don't believe\nthat we've got any significant issues with any of our scheduled production or\nany of our customers looking to defer that further. As a matter of fact, we\nhave some customers who are pretty excited to accelerate production, but we're\ntrying to balance that with our workforce. We don't want to let people go and\nthen pull them back and then let them go again.\n\nOne of the ways that we're able to maintain good manufacturing margin is\nhaving steady production rates and a steady workforce. So, as we look at the\nrest of the year, we're looking at things like reducing where we were running\non three shifts at some of our facilities and pulling that back to running\njust two shifts, maybe working four days instead of five or six days a week.\nThose are the kinds of measures that our manufacturing team is looking at to\nbalance our headcount with the production rates. And again, as you think about\nit, we do have strong backlog, but overall demand has subsided. And we want to\nmake certain that we are appropriately pacing our production to meet our\ncustomers' needs, but also to take us through the next year and a half or so.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nYeah. Unfortunately, if you look at that production, you've got to increase\ninventories. We're going to constrict inventories. We'd like to face things as\nLorie said. If we take a step back, a couple of steps back though, and you see\nthe government policy as it sorts out at different levels. It's quite clear\nwhat the intent is, keep people home, break the back of the virus level, level\nthe curve. We hear all those things. But, I'm not so sure everybody\nunderstands why they're doing it, what the game is. There are various centers,\nof course, as we hit the peak in this, but they're basically trying to push\nthis down to maintain our hospitals and get capabilities to deal with\npatients.\n\nThere will be therefore an effort to return to normalcy, and already you're\nseeing in Europe and we have the benefit of that vision from two or three\nmonths ago. What happens if there's success, even Italy is having some now\ngreen shoots as reported this morning. So, I think that, if you look at what's\ngoing on here, you can have more comfort that there might be a return to\nnormalcy or closer to -- something closer to normalcy by the middle of summer.\nIt's really hard to predict, though, whether demand will come back for some of\nthe things that we normally see at the end of -- the last two quarters of our\nfiscal year. We're not expecting that. We're managing for cash and our resolve\nis very firm. We're looking to protect the downside and hope -- very hopeful\n-- very hopeful for the upside. And we'll be willing and capable of responding\nto it when it comes and it will come.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nThanks, Bill and Lorie. I guess, what I'm just confused by the answer, maybe\njust to clarify it a little bit more is, if every slot is filled and nothing\nhas changed on that, what changes on the second half? Because you've said\nevery production slot is filled, is it that you are slowing down because\ncustomers don't want it?\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nRight. Let me interrupt you for a moment, just to say what Lorie is saying and\nwhat I'm saying is, every slot is filled, but we're reducing the flow through,\nso we can reduce our overhead and we can optimize cash. So, this is something\nwe are working with our customers to do. And I don't think the last two\nquarters of this year will be necessarily following a pattern over the last\nfew years. We expect a simple answer to, I think, your question.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nYeah. No. That makes a lot -- that makes sense. I get it now. I appreciate\nthat. Thanks, Bill.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nWe're doing as self -- we're self imposing a lot of this ourselves.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nYeah. No, no, I get it, slowing production. And then, Lorie, just to clarify\non what you were talking with Bascome about the leased railcars for\nsyndication. Does that mean you're keeping more of what you build or I just\nwant to understand the temporary view of what Bill said was the $50 million\nsale? Is that just you had some extra at the end of the quarter and then you\nsold them or -- I just want to understand or are you building more because you\nsaid the backlog wasn't that great in terms of what you're keeping, but looks\nlike what those leased car -- leased railcars for syndication on the balance\nsheet jumped up. So, is that temporary, keeping more of what you build?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nRight. So, again, what I was trying to say to Bascome, and thanks for the\nquestion, is the timing of syndication is not necessarily linear. And so, as\nyou look at the February balance sheet, it had a higher than normal value and\nnumber of units in railcar sales for syndication. What Bill was referencing is\nsomething that happened in March, meaning that the syndication and our\npartners are still open for business and some of that moved off of our balance\nsheet in the month of March. We expect that to continue.\n\nTo the question about how much is in our backlog associated with leases that\nwe expect to syndicate and being a fairly small number, I think what you're\nseeing is what has been happening over the last six months where lease\noriginations have flowed. It's not that we're expecting to keep those on our\nbalance sheet. It's just that side of the market slowed down a little bit,\nconsistent with the broader demand for new railcars.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nIn our scenarios, I anticipate that we may have to keep a large amount on our\nbalance sheet and that's why we think we need the extra capital\u2026\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nOur downside scenarios.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nOur downside scenarios. And we did post quarter, do a lot more in putting\nsyndications and assets a lot much more than $48 million, that was a single\ndeal. We did 2 times or 3 times that I imagine -- two or three other big\ndeals. And so the market is still open to us. I think the terms are changing,\nprofitability might change. But, we think we've got a good handle on that. And\nthat is however -- that is the other big risk that we are managing besides\nkeeping our factories running under the protection that we have and other car\nbuilders may have as essential industries.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nAppreciate all the answers and time. Sorry?\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nAnd then, just to underline what Bill said earlier, again, even if these\nassets stay on the balance sheet, they are generating lease income.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nYeah, right. No, I appreciate all the answers and time. If I could just get\none housekeeping, Justin. What's the marine backlog for the quarter?\n\n**Justin M. Roberts** -- _Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer_\n\nIt was probably around I think $60 million to $70 million.\n\n**Adrian J. Downes** -- _Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and\nChief Financial Officer_\n\nI think it was $59 million or $60 million.\n\nAlso Read:  Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) Q3 2020 Earnings Call\nTranscript](https://news.alphastreet.com/darden-restaurants-inc-nyse-\ndri-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\n **Justin M. Roberts** -- _Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer_\n\nSo, about $60 million.\n\n**Ken Hoexter** -- _Bank of America -- Analyst_\n\nAll right, wonderful. I appreciate the time and stay healthy and well\neverybody. Thank you.\n\n**Justin M. Roberts** -- _Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer_\n\nThanks, Ken.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\n**Operator**\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Steve Barger. Your line is open.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nHi. Good morning, everybody.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nUnderstandable why you would want to reduce capacity. But, how did you decide\nwhich plants to close? And I'm specifically thinking about seeing more of the\nreductions coming from the lower cost Mexican facilities. Are there supply\nchain issues down there, or anywhere in North America, or are you refocusing\non the US to avoid potential border issues?\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nPartly the second one, but mainly it was the product mix. The big gap was the\ngeneral type cars in the plant -- our plant two in Sahagun, in Hidalgo, the\nstate of Hidalgo. Our joint venture plant has a very good specialization in\ntank cars. We produce tank cars at our plant three, which is Tlaxcala, state\nof Tlaxcala, in Tlaxcala, city of Tlaxcala. So, I think it was more for\nselected product mix coupled with at the time of some concerns about moving a\nbit more to the US footprints and testing the efficiency of the ARI facilities\nand they are reasonably efficient. But, it is true that the Mexican base in\nnormal circumstances is a very, very efficient base. And we expect normalcy\nreturns to go back to a business as usual in all three factories in Mexico.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nAnd I would say at this point, we are not having any significant supply chain\nissues for the North American markets. We had actually planned ahead as many\ncompanies do before the lunar new year and had stocked up on inventory that we\nwould have been getting elsewhere, the essential business that we're operating\nunder actually impacts our suppliers as well. So, we've been able to maintain\nthe supply chains. The one exception is a little bit in Europe where that part\nof what led to a two weeks closure for the year an extended Easter holiday is\nto allow the supply chain to get caught up. They do transport more via the\nroads versus on the rails. And I'm sure everyone saw the picture as borders\nwere shut and they -- it took a little bit of time for them to figure out how\nto expedite the transportation of some of those supplies across borders.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nIt's really important to understand what happened in Europe and compare it\nhere to imagine what would occur, interstate commerce if each state put up\nroadblocks and barriers and delayed interstate commerce from one state to\nanother, or in the case of Europe from one city to the other. In Italy for\nexample, the individual towns are -- have blockades. You can't go in. You\ncan't go out. And we don't have come to that in America, yet we're prepared if\nit were to come to deal with that environment. And we've issued credentials to\nall of our essential employees, so that they can continue business operating\nas essential US industry.\n\nAnd we believe our supply chain is through the railroad system. This is a\ngreat advantage of rail and it's just spectacular advantage of rail that they\ndon't have to stop at the borders and they're protected. This is a very big\nthing to understand. It's going to give us a real hit in the rail sector in\nEurope, in the sense of heavy uplift. So, I think that's kind of a silver\nlining in this cloud that we don't -- we hope that this is not going occur in\nAmerica, but it could. And if it happens, we're ready for it and the rail is\ngoing to be the solution.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nThat's great color. Thank you. And just to the point on the mix for the south\nof the border facilities, how should we think about modeling minority interest\nin the back half? Will you see lower production from GIMSA?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nI would suspect, if you wanted to model, and we're not giving guidance. But, I\nthink one of the things you might notice in our press release today is\nminority interest was a bit lower than normal. That is tied into the timing of\nrail car syndication. So, less of the GIMSA joint venture up in revenue and\ngross margin, therefore less going out as our partner share. I would expect\nthat to turn to be more normalized like in the first quarter for the next\ncouple of quarters as the syndications work their way out.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nHowever, can I just make one comment? We are working with our partner there,\ngiven these special circumstances to correct that imbalance. And if we succeed\nin reaching an accord, I think we'll have an uplift in that category. So, all\nof Lorie's comments, we may have a more favorable picture and that's a bucket\nof cash that we expect we might be able to also obtain in that relationship\nthat we have a very supportive partner there. I'm really pleased with their\ncooperation, source of cash. And I think, we'll see -- I'm pretty positive,\nwe'll have some good news to announce on that. We probably will be very\ntransparent when we finish it too.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nAnd just for clarity around liquidity and cash flow. You've given a lot of\ndetail around being able to generate cash savings from the actions you're\ntaking. But, as you think about production expectations, managing working\ncapital, timing of syndication activity, do you expect positive operating cash\nflow this year?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nYes.\n\n**Adrian J. Downes** -- _Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and\nChief Financial Officer_\n\nYes, we do.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nAnd with lower capex, will you generate free cash flow this year?\n\n**Adrian J. Downes** -- _Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and\nChief Financial Officer_\n\nI would say that we feel pretty confident that we'll be -- I think at this\npoint, based on what we see that is a strong possibility. Again, borrowing\nBill's phrase, we don't know what we don't know at this point. But from what\nwe see as the lay of the land, currently, that's the plan that we're working\ntowards.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThe great thing is you can operate your factories is that this kind of\nbusiness throws off cash flow, as you liquidate inventories. In normal cycle,\nyou wouldn't have this issue with cash because you throw up a lot of cash. So,\nit should be positive. However, if you can't operate your factories, which is\nthe situation many companies are in, then you can't run it up and everything\nis on it -- turned upside down. We expect to keep our factories operating\nsafely, and that's a core risk or threat that we're managing.\n\n**Steve Barger** -- _KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nUnderstood. Thanks.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nGood.\n\n**Operator**\n\nThank you. Last question comes from Matt Elkott. Your line is open, sir. Thank\nyou.\n\n**Matt Elkott** -- _Cowen -- Analyst_\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Once we've made it out of this pandemic and it's well\nin the rearview mirror, are we looking at a manufacturing footprint that is\nadjusted and right-sized on a permanent basis, meaning total production output\nless than pre-pandemic levels?\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nWe would call it optimized. Yes, we're optimizing our total footprint for the\nexpected market, longer term. We have a great franchise. We have great\nmarkets, we simply need to prune the tree a bit and we need to look very, very\nhard in the strategic bucket that Lorie is talking about, about non-core, non-\nessential businesses to Greenbrier. Not non-essential in the nature of the\nbusiness but those businesses that are central to our new footprint. It's just\ntime to prune the tree, create cash, run the company for cash, improve\nshareholder value over the immediate future. I might remind you that after the\ngreat depression, or the last pandemic of this scale after World War I, the\nGreat War, everybody came back. They had great casualty rate from that. And\nthen, came The Roaring Twenties. So, when people housebound and unable to buy\nonce they get out, they're going to be shopping I think, at least some of them\nwill, many of them but I know will.\n\n**Matt Elkott** -- _Cowen -- Analyst_\n\nYeah. That's helpful. And also, I just wanted to make sure I understood\nsomething on the cadence of deliveries. I know you guys removed for fee --\nsome cars for the backlog that were supposed to be delivered in future\nperiods. Historically, your second half deliveries are higher than your first\nhalf deliveries, at least in the last couple of fiscal years. Now, given the\nfact that it seems like you guys are not currently engaged in any further\nconversations about further cancellations, or deferments, will these second\nhalf deliveries be higher than the first half deliveries, if no more\ncancellations occur?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nI think, that's a good estimation is that the second half would be stronger\nthan the first half on a deliveries perspective. Some of it's just again the\ntiming of syndications and the stuff is on the balance sheet which will flow\nthrough and be counted as the delivery in the second half that will offset\nsome of the production reductions that we're doing. But all in, I would say,\nat least what we know today, second half deliveries, possibly a little bit\nstronger than first half, some of that being driven by international\noperations, not necessarily North American operations.\n\nAnd again, this is part of why we are suspending guidance is every day brings\nnew activities. And by new activities, I don't mean conversations with\ncustomers about potential cancellations, but edicts by governments and\nmunicipalities, and that creating a stir and stress on workforce and whether\nor not people can go to work etc., etc. We feel very comfortable and strongly\nthat we are an essential business and we will continue to operate. But that\ndoesn't mean that we're not a little bit less efficient as you continue to\ndeal with some of the unavoidable stress associated with this pandemic.\n\n**Matt Elkott** -- _Cowen -- Analyst_\n\nGot it. So, you mentioned, Lorie, the international deliveries. So, when all\nthis is said and done, are you likely to look back and say that the fact that\nyou're the only North American manufacturer with a significant international\noperations helps you kind of soften -- or mitigate the blow of apex, given the\nrolling infection apexes around the world. So, if one place in lockdown and\nother place may not be -- so, is that going to you think play to your\nadvantage when this is all said and done?\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nI would say that our strategy of expanding our footprint internationally\nabsolutely is going to help us be a stronger and more resilient and more\nliquid entity going forward. Unfortunately, it's not like you can shift\nproduction out of, let's say, the United States down to Brazil to bring back\nto United States. But, we do think having manufacturing and a rail freight\npresence in some of these markets that we believe will be very strong markets\nfor railcar production and freight loadings. So, Brazil and Europe does make\nus a stronger company going forward.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nI'd just give an example of that Lorie. In Europe, the differences, post\ncrisis that favor rail are going to be dramatic because of the issues with\nborder crossings they've had. And that's quite clear. But there already is a\nvery healthy green movement and a very large investment in rail in the\nbillions to take traffic away from chocked highway and other business. So,\nthis is going to be very positive for Europe; Brazil, similarly as those kinds\nof forces going on. So, I think that the diversification, as Europe comes out\nof this earlier than we do, will help Greenbrier a very great deal.\n\n**Matt Elkott** -- _Cowen -- Analyst_\n\nGot it. And just one final question, Bill related to what you were just\nexplaining. In past recession, you guys dealt with losses in the great\nrecession and I think in 2013. Can you maybe summarize for us how Greenbrier\nis different today than it was in 2013, and then during the great recession?\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nSure. I'll take a shot at it and Lorie can you add. But basically, our product\nmix is dramatically different. Our industry leadership is different. We have a\nspectacularly different franchise. Number one, or number two in three major\nmarkets, two internationally. North America, we diversified our footprint to\nhave more optionality in the United States. We have some efficient plans,\nwe're getting those knocked into shape and they're making progress every\nquarter in Arkansas. So, I think the company is dramatically different than it\nwas -- our management team is together to experience. Lorie and the financial\nteam are doing a great job and Lorie is also getting a great deal of\nexperience in operations, turned around a lot of -- some of last year's\nissues. And I think the company is really on a very solid strategic footing at\nthis point. We have to get through this crisis like everybody else.\n\n**Matt Elkott** -- _Cowen -- Analyst_\n\nThank you very much.\n\n**Lorie L. Tekorius** -- _President and Chief Operating Officer_\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\n**William A. Furman** -- _Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors_\n\nThanks, Matt. Thank you very much everyone for your time today and your\nattention. If you have any other questions, you can reach out to myself,\nJustin, or Adrian down to Lorie, and we also have the Investor Relations email\naddress on our website as well. Thank you. And stay safe and healthy out\nthere.\n\n**Lorie L.

Holdings Corporation SEM has withdrawn its earlier-provided guidance\nfor 2020.%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/select-medical-revokes-\nfull-year-view-amid-coronavirus-blues-2020-04-06)\n\nGrappled with the uncertainty related to the coronavirus breakout, **Select\nMedical Holdings Corporation**[SEM](/market-activity/stocks/sem) has withdrawn\nits earlier-provided guidance for 2020.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2020 net operating revenues were expected in the range of\n$5.575-$5.675 billion (up 3.2% year over year), adjusted EBITDA between $725.0\nmillion and $760.0 million (up 4.4% year over year) and diluted earnings per\ncommon share in the $1.27-$1.46 (up 8.9% year over year) band.\n\nSelect Medical has been performing impressively over the past many years,\nevident from its revenue CAGR of 12.2% from 2014 to 2019. It also witnessed\nadjusted EBITDA CAGR of 14.3%. Further, the company reported a free cash flow\nof $288 million which was, however, down 13.5% year over year. The company\u2019s\nfree cash flow per share of $1.74 is better than the industry average of\n$1.22.\n\nHowever, its high-debt level in its capital structure raises a concern. Its\nnet debt-to-capital is 80.2%, much higher than the industry\u2019s average of\n24.8%. Also, its interest coverage ratio of 2.32 times is much lower than its\nindustry average of 10.73 times.\n\nSelect Medical operates the majority of its critical illness recovery\nhospitals as a hospital within a hospital (an HIH). As an HIH, it typically\nleases space from a general acute care hospital or \u201chost hospital\u201d and\noperates as a separately-licensed hospital within the host hospital. Patients\nsuffering chronic critical illness are typically admitted to the company\u2019s\ncritical illness recovery hospitals from general acute care hospitals and are\nlikely to stay in a unit similar to intensive care. Now since the number of\nadmissions at hospitals fell significantly following the postponement of\nelective procedures to accommodate any potential spike in the COVID-19 cases,\nthe supply of business to Select Medical naturally took a big hit.\n\nSelect Medical is one of the largest providers of post-acute care, operating\n101 critical illness recovery hospitals across 28 states. It enters the list\nof other hospitals in the United States that discarded their earnings guidance\ndue to business disruption from the COVID-19 breakout. It won\u2019t be much of a\nsurprise to see aggressive cost-cutting efforts from Select Medical in order\nto preserve its margins.\n\nYear to date, the stock has lost 8.6% compared with its\n[industry](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/industry/medical-\nhmos-108)'s decline of 27.3%.\n\n![](https://staticx-\ntuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/sem%20pp\\(2\\).jpg)\n\nMost recently, Tenet Healthcare Corporation [THC](/market-activity/stocks/thc)\nand MEDNAX Inc. [MD](/market-activity/stocks/md) scrapped their 2020 earnings\noutlook.\n\nMoreover, leading hospital company HCA Healthcare, Inc. [HCA](/market-\nactivity/stocks/hca) laid off some of its employees and slashed wages to\ncontrol costs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to deal a significant blow to the\nhospital industry that has been hugely cash-strapped and debt-ridden.  \nSelect Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see [**the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks\nhere**](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-\nlist/?ADID=zp_1link&ICID=zpi%20_1link) **.**\n\n**Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential**  \n  \nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as\nscientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

What is\noften forgotten is the fact that some of the best startups in the world solve\nthe simplest of problems.\n\nThis is exactly the approach that Pascal Henry, who is the CEO and cofounder\nof [HReasily](https://www.hreasily.com/), took when he identified the\nfundamental needs of rapidly growing SMEs\u2013to manage their human resources more\nefficiently.\n\nHenry launched his Singapore-based HR firm in late 2015 as a [Software-as-a-\nService](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/19/the-top-\nthree-2019-saas-trends-and-how-theyre-changing-it-management/#154f808c71bc)\n(SaaS) business that enables companies to increase productivity by using\ntechnology to streamline traditional processes such as payroll processing,\nleave management and expense claims.\n\n**\u201c** When I was running my first startup in Singapore, I had to do a lot of\nthe manual processes myself. I felt the pain and the drain of it,\u201d explains\nHenry. \u201cIt was taking up a lot of my time and energy, when I should have been\nfocusing on building my business.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Asia](https://www.forbes.com/asia)\n\n  * [\n\n### Chinese Tech Players Like These Are Benefiting From The Work-From-Home\nTrend\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2020/04/08/chinese-tech-players-like-\nthese-are-benefiting-from-the-work-from-home-trend/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Mi 10 Pro Review: Xiaomi\u2019s First True Premium Flagship\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2020/04/08/mi-10-pro-review-xiaomis-\nfirst-true-premium-flagship/)\n\n  * [\n\n### To Prevent Global Depression, Governments Must Act Soon\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yuwahedrickwong/2020/04/07/to-prevent-global-\ndepression-governments-must-act-soon/)\n\n **Improving productivity and efficiency**\n\nHReasily\u2019s mission is simple: To innovate and automate HR throughout the\nworld. As one of the fastest-growing cloud-based [HR SaaS\ncompanies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/07/18/the-hr-software-\nmarket-reinvents-itself/#e9e77df5d0af) in the region, their simple modules and\nfeatures aim to transform many of the legacy HR processes and automate them to\nbe accessible anytime and anywhere. Currently the company offers seven modules\nincluding payroll, staff leave, employee contracts and attendance. As HReasily\ngrows, it continues to add product lines aimed at empowering companies to\nscale faster.\n\nPreviously, many businesses used solutions that each looked after a particular\nsilo of an HR department. So you\u2019d have one system to manage your payroll\ncalculations, one for leave and others for other functions.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was you had to log in and out of many various systems, and\nthese systems cost a huge amount of money,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is\nbuild a solution that is very affordable that integrates with all the\nfunctions on a unified platform.\u201d\n\n**A simple but elegant business model**\n\nHReasily runs a [subscription-based revenue\nmodel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/12/whats-behind-\nthe-rise-of-the-subscription-model/#56543b1e35c3). Starting with payroll,\nwhich is at the core of every traditional HR office, the company offers\npremium versions that run on monthly or yearly subscriptions, with add-on\nmodules available such as staff leave and time attendance. This past summer at\nthe [RISE 2019 conference](https://riseconf.com/) in Hong Kong, Henry and his\nteam unveiled their latest benefits management module which will soon allow\ncustomers to acquire group level insurance, healthcare and even apply for\ncredit cards or loans.\n\nHReasily says its competitive advantage lies in its customer base, which is\nmostly SMEs. By initially focusing on the fundamental needs of this particular\nsegment, the company has earned the support of larger banking and government\nagencies and has become known as an \u201cSME champion.\u201d Not surprisingly, as the\ncompany has grown it says that it began to attract larger corporations,\npublicly listed companies, multinational corporations and even payroll\noutsourcing firms.\n\n\u201cAs we grew we acquired a more diverse customer base,\u201d Henry says, \u201cbecause a\nlot of larger companies are tired of the older and expensive solutions because\nthey need to be installed on premise and they require a refresher every year\nwhen rules and regulations change.\u201d\n\n**Partnerships are the key to rapid growth**\n\nBeing based in Singapore has allowed HReasily to capitalize on the rapid\ngrowth in[ Southeast\nAsia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vinnielauria/2019/05/14/big-upsurge-in-e-\ncommerce-drives-southeast-asias-online-economy/#77c08fc83309). SME\u2019s account\nfor 97% of all the enterprises in the region, and employ half of the\nworkforce, according to data from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\nHReasily\u2019s growth has been nothing short of impressive. With nearly 30,000\ncompanies on their platform and more than 100 new companies onboarding every\nday, HReasily is said to be growing rapidly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSome of HReasily\u2019s notable customers include Love Bonito (in Singapore,\nIndonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong), Sambat Finance (Cambodia), OnlinePajak\n(Indonesia) and TechInAsia. As the company looks to complete their coverage of\nAsia, the next major market they look to tackle is mainland China followed by\nTaiwan, Japan, Myanmar and Australia.\n\nInvestors have taken notice of the company\u2019s growth as well. Fresh off a pre-\nseries A [funding\nround](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hreasily-receives-\nus-5-million-investment-from-envy-capital-1028514742) of $5 million from Envy\nCapital, HReasily is currently estimated to be valued at more than $100\nmillion. Henry admits that the company\u2019s rapid growth in the region has only\nbeen possible with the early support from their key strategic partners.\n\nHReasily has been working with Citibank, Mazars and Stripe. The partnership\nwith [Mazars](https://www.mazars.co.th/Home/News/Mazars-in-the-press/Mazars-\ndevelops-its-digital-services-with-HReasily), which was a lead investor from\nthe startup\u2019s first round of funding, gives them access to a global audit,\nadvisory and payroll outsourcing firm with 300 offices in 100 countries. Henry\nsays it allows HReasily to localize its solutions to each individual market.\n\n**\u201c** Today, building a solid ecosystem of strategic partners is very\nimportant because you come from different angles, but you all serve one\ncustomer, which is the SME or the business,\u201d says Henry. \u201cBy coming together,\nwe collectively create a great end-to-end experience for them. There\u2019s\nstrength in numbers.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jaykimmer) or\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykimmer).

[Operator\ninstructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your\nspeaker today, Bob LaFleur, vice president of investor relations and capital\nmarkets. Thank you.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\n **Bob LaFleur** \\-- _Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital\nMarkets_\n\nThank you for joining us on the call today to discuss our fourth-quarter and\nfull-year 2019 results. Joining me today are Chewy's CEO, Sumit Singh; and CFO\nMario Marte. Our earnings release and letter to shareholders, which were filed\nwith the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, have been posted to the Investor\nRelations section of our website, investor.chewy.com. A link to the webcast of\ntoday's conference call is also available on our site.\n\nOn our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements, including\nstatements concerning Chewy's future prospects, financial results; business\nstrategies; industry trends and our ability to successfully respond to\nbusiness risks, including those related to the spread of COVID-19, including\nany adverse impacts on our supply chain, workforce, fulfillment centers, other\nfacilities, customer service operations and future plans. Such statements are\nconsidered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our\nforward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered an\nindication of future performance. Also note that the forward-looking\nstatements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's\ndate.\n\nWe disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as\nrequired by law. For further information, please refer to the risk factors and\nother information in Chewy's 10-K and 8-K filed earlier today and in our other\nfilings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided on our Investor\nRelations website and in our earnings release and letter to shareholders,\nwhich were filed with the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP results.\nAdditionally, as a reminder, prior-period results this quarter include an\nextra week. So on an as-reported basis, Q4 2019 results reflect 13 weeks of\noperations, while Q4 2018 results reflect 14 weeks. Likewise, full-year fiscal\n2019 results reflect 52 weeks of operations, while full-year fiscal 2018\nresults reflect 53 weeks of operations.\n\nIn our reported results for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2018, the extra week\ncontributed $82.9 million in additional net sales, which included $49.1\nmillion of Autoship customer sales. For comparability, during our call today,\nall year-over-year growth rates discussed regarding net sales, Autoship\ncustomer sales and net sales per active customer reflect comparable 13- or\n52-week periods. Finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast on our\nInvestor Relations website. A replay of this call will also be available on\nour IR website shortly.\n\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Sumit.\n\n**Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThanks, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call. Before I get\nstarted, I want to welcome Bob to the Chewy team. He brings extensive\nexperience on both the sell-side and investor relations areas, and we are\nexcited to have him on the team as we enter our second year as a public\ncompany. While 2019 closed on a high note and 2020 got off to a similarly\nstrong start, suddenly, the world changed in a big way.\n\nAs we have seen, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption to\nglobal commerce and financial markets. Our hearts go out to those directly\naffected by this disease and those suffering from the economic and social\ndislocation that have followed in its wake. It is in times like these when our\nmission to be the most trusted and convenient online destination for pet\nparents everywhere rings truer than ever. As pet parents, we know how special\nand comforting the bond is between humans and pets, especially in these\nstressful times.\n\nHow soothing a simple act like a game of fetch with your dog or curling up on\nthe couch with your cat can be. We devote ourselves every day to supporting\nthese special relationships. We are here for our pet parents and their pets\nworking 24/7 to meet their needs while caring for the safety and well-being of\nour team members. Our shop-at-home business is proving resilient amid the\ncurrent economic disruption.\n\nOur volumes have increased as customers have chosen to stay at home and take\nadvantage of the shopping convenience that we provide. We will discuss the\nfinancial impact of current trends and our guidance a little later in this\ncall. Taking care of our team members, health and well-being is essential to\nall of us in the Chewy leadership team, and we are being highly proactive in\nour internal response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are in constant\ncommunication to plan and adapt as swiftly as possible to these rapidly\nevolving conditions, and our COVID-19 response team is providing daily updates\nto our team members across the company.\n\nWe have expanded our health benefits and revised our PTO and sick-day policies\nto meet the evolving needs of this unique situation. Additionally, we have\nmaterially increased cleaning and sanitizing procedures throughout our work\nsites, including our customer service sites and fulfillment centers. We have\ninstituted work from home at our corporate locations, as well as for a portion\nof our customer service teams. Regarding our fulfillment centers and customer\nservice centers, we have detailed contingency plans in place should we\nexperience an on-site COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWe have the ability to divert fulfillment and/or customer service contacts to\nother facilities while we isolate and restore the affected facility. We\nbelieve we can absorb the facility being off-line for a short period of time\nwith minimal incremental disruption to customer service levels. So with that,\nlet's discuss our Q4 financial performance and some of the key milestones and\nachievements contained in our full-year 2019 results. I'll update you on some\nbusiness initiatives and then turn the call over to Mario to discuss our Q4\nand full-year results in more detail and to discuss our guidance.\n\nAs I indicated, we closed 2019 on a high note. In Q4, net sales grew 35% to\n$1.4 billion or 1.5 times full-year sales just three years ago, underscoring\nthe power of our business model. We ended the quarter and year with 13.5\nmillion active customers, an increase of 2.9 million customers compared to the\nend of fiscal 2018, and our net sales per active customer grew 10% to $360.\nOur subscription-like Autoship business remains strong, with Autoship\ncustomers representing over 70% of total net sales in Q4.\n\nHigher spending from our existing customers and growing Autoship sales reflect\nstrong business momentum as more customers continue to shift their spending to\nChewy, driving increased basket size and higher repeat purchase activity. In\nQ4, we were again able to expand margins while growing the top line. Q4 gross\nmargin expanded 320 basis points versus prior-year fourth quarter to 24.1%. Q4\nadjusted EBITDA margin expanded 470 basis points over Q4 2018 to negative\n0.4%, reflecting the progress we have made on gross margin expansion and the\nongoing scaling of our advertising and marketing spend.\n\nLooking broadly at 2019, the sum of our efforts came through in our results.\nFor the full year, we grew net sales by 40% to $4.85 billion, expanded gross\nmargin by 340 basis points to 23.6% and improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by\n480 basis points to negative 1.7%. We continue to get big fast while getting\nfit fast, as demonstrated by growth in our top line and improvement in our\nbottom line. We know the opportunity in front of us remains large and now even\nmore so.\n\nAs some of you may already know, in 2019, the Chewy team made great strides\ntoward becoming the most trusted and convenient destination for pet parents\neverywhere. We innovated at pace, made smart investments in marketing and site\nmerchandising and introduced new products and solutions that enhanced and\nstreamlined the shopping experience for pet parents, fueling greater trust\ntoward our brand. We continue to grow and make targeted investments in our\nstrategic pillars, private brands, and Chewy Pharmacy, and we expanded our\nnetwork of fulfillment centers. The American Pet Products Association or APPA\nrecently announced that U.S.\n\nsales of pet products and services surpassed $95 billion in 2019 and are\nprojected to reach nearly $100 billion in 2020. So not only is the addressable\nmarket larger than previously estimated, but the pace of growth remains\nrobust. Additional research from APPA indicates that 72% of pet owners\nreported making at least one online purchase for their pet in the past 12\nmonths. Of those making subscription-based purchases of pet products, 94%\nreport that their buying frequency has increased or stayed the same in the\npast 12 months.\n\nClearly, these trends all bode well for the future sustainability of our\noverall value proposition at this pace. When you combine a growing category,\ncustomer migration from off-line to online and Chewy's unique shopping\nexperience and award-winning customer service, we believe that we are still in\nthe early innings of our growth. To this end, the core inputs of our business\ncontinue to trend positively. We remain maniacally focused on execution and\nare delivering the best possible customer experience for pet parents.\n\nWe are convinced that we are positively transforming an industry by creating a\ntruly unique and personalized shopping experience, one that builds trust,\nbrand loyalty and drives repeat purchasing. Our focus on these pillars\nultimately supports our long-term goals of sustainable top-line growth at\nscale and incremental margin expansion. Now I would like to share a few\nbusiness highlights from our fourth quarter and, broadly, full-year 2019 and\nalso provide insight into our thinking for fiscal-year 2020. As I noted on the\nQ3 earnings call in December, we went into the Q4 holiday cycle well planned\nand ready to delight customers.\n\nOur thoughtful and integrated go-to-market approach, resonated well with\ncustomers and reflected in both our demand and conversion metrics, leading to\nrecord-setting days with Cyber Monday being the single biggest shopping day in\nour company's history. We continue to remain disciplined and data-driven in\nevery investment-related decision that we make. For instance, in marketing, we\nclosely track key metrics like customer acquisition cost and lifetime value\nand have been investing in tools to optimize our model and drive further\nefficiencies. The data management platform or the DMP, combined with our\nongoing optimizations in marketing data science, is enabling us to more\nefficiently target existing and new customer audiences across the industry,\nresulting in more efficient use of our marketing spend.\n\nFor example, in Q4, our performance marketing teams, in conjunction with our\nmarketing science teams, use the DMP to target new prospective audiences.\nWithin the specific channels where we were most utilizing our DMP, we observed\nfavorable trends in both customer acquisitions and cost per acquisition.\nLooking back at 2019, we are pleased with the progress we have made across\nChewy private brands and Chewy Healthcare, two areas we discussed in some\ndetail on last quarter's call. Both are critical components of the overall\nvalue proposition we offer Chewy customers, and in 2020, we will build upon\nthe momentum established last year in these two important business lines.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2020, we are staying ahead of the curve and driving\ninnovations in areas that not only enhance the customer experience but also\nincrease efficiency and streamline our cost structures. One such area this\nyear is our fulfillment network where, barring any disruptions related to a\nbroadening of the COVID-19 crisis, we are planning to launch two new\nfulfillment centers or FCs in FY 2020, starting with our new facility in\nSalisbury, North Carolina, which is planned to launch later this month. This\nwill be our tenth FC and will enable us to more quickly and efficiently reach\nmillions of customers across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast region. Then later\nin the year, barring any unforeseen delays or schedule changes caused by\nCOVID-19-related government mandates, we expect to launch our 11th FC in\nArchibald, Pennsylvania, which is currently under construction.\n\nThis will be our first automated fulfillment center, and we are very excited\nabout it. This state-of-the-art facility will raise the bar on future upgrades\nto our fulfillment network. Over the last few years, we have made significant\nimprovements across our fulfillment operations, which you may recall is\nlargely manual and driven by lean manufacturing principles, driving efficiency\nand reducing our fixed and variable fulfillment cost per unit in the process.\nThese initiatives have yielded meaningful cost savings that, over time, will\naccelerate our SG&A efficiency curve.\n\nAutomating the Archibald fulfillment center will enable us to increase\nthroughput capacity of this building versus similarly sized facilities by more\nthan 25%, increased labor productivity by more than 50% and, as a direct\nresult of all of the above, enabled us to further lower our fixed and variable\nfulfillment cost per unit by over 30%. Equally importantly, it will create a\nsafer and more productive environment for our team members to work within.\nLeaning on our disciplined and data-driven approach, we made bold investments\nin the areas where we believe we can improve experience and generate outsized\nreturns for our shareholders, put a rigorous measurement framework around it\nand then aim to execute flawlessly to achieve the results. The same framework\nis an application here, and we expect to generate attractive returns on\ninvestments we are making into our fulfillment network.\n\nAs in many ways, the payback is more direct. The investments we make in\ndriving efficiencies in our fulfillment network, which you'll see in our SG&A\nand capex, result in direct cost savings, which fall, dollar for dollar,\nstraight to the bottom line and are meaningful profitability accelerators. A\nfinal note on COVID-19 situation before I conclude. I touched on the demand\nside of this equation in my opening remarks, but I know many of you are also\ncurious about potential vulnerabilities in our supply chain.\n\nWhen you look at the details of our supply chain, consumables, mostly food and\ntreats, represent over 70% of our sales. These products are sourced almost\nexclusively in the U.S., and we were proactive in jointly planning supply and\ntransportation requirements with our strategic vendors. Our hard goods\nsourcing is more diversified, and we actively manage our inventory levels to\nprotect against potential disruptions in the supply chain given the long lead\ntimes from order to having the inventory on hand. Last but not least, our\nproactive and extensive cleaning and sanitizing procedures throughout our work\nsites, including our fulfillment centers and customer service sites, have thus\nfar prevented any confirmed COVID-19 cases across our work sites, minimizing\nany disruptions to our network.\n\nSo far, we have not seen material disruptions in our operations or supply\nchain. However, the situation is evolving on a daily basis, and we continue to\nmonitor the impact on our business and our future plans for the business.\nRegarding guidance, given where we are in the first quarter, we are\ncomfortable providing guidance for the current quarter, and Mario will discuss\nthis shortly. Due to the evolving situation with the COVID-19 outbreak, as\nwell as the active risk it poses to all of us, including our partners and\nnetwork, we do not think it prudent to provide full-year guidance at this\ntime.\n\nWe do not take this move lightly, especially because at this time, as I\nindicated in my opening remarks, volumes are running ahead of our expectations\nfrom earlier in the quarter. That said, in light of the unprecedented nature\nof the current pandemic, the steps being taken to mitigate the outbreak and\nthe sheer number of other variables outside our control, we believe that this\nis the best course of action. We thank you in advance for your understanding\non this matter, and we hope to be able to update you with more clarity on our\nQ1 call in early June. 2019 was an important year for Chewy, and while I'll\nnote that we were pleased with our IPO last June, it was just one step in a\nlong journey.\n\nWe continue to believe that we are in early stages of a large market\nopportunity of offering pet parents a unique value proposition. We are working\ntoward building an enduring franchise through exceptional rigor that delivers\ntop-line growth and expanded operating margins and disciplined cash flow\nmanagement. We are as excited as ever about the opportunity ahead of us, and\nwe look forward to a great 2020. Now I will turn the call over to Mario, who\nwill provide the details on our Q4 results and walk you through our current\nfinancial outlook.\n\nMario?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nThank you, Sumit. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth-quarter results\nhighlight our disciplined execution and the power of a customer-centric model,\ncombined with the convenience of e-commerce in the pet category. Fourth-\nquarter net sales reached $1.35 billion, bringing our total fiscal 2019 net\nsales to $4.85 billion.\n\nRemoving the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter last year, this\nrepresents 35% growth in the quarter and 40% growth for the year, driven by\ncontinued growth in our customer base and net sales per active customer.\nAutoship customer sales growth outpaced overall net sales growth for both Q4\nand full-year 2019. Autoship customer sales for the fourth quarter of 2019\nwere $954.2 million, representing 70.4% of total net sales and reflected 40.8%\ngrowth compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Autoship customer sales for the\nfull year were $3.36 billion or 69.4% of total net sales, reflecting 47.9%\ngrowth compared to 2018.\n\nWe ended the fourth quarter and year with 13.5 million active customers, an\nincrease of 2.9 million customers versus the end of fiscal-year 2018. The\nincrease in active customers is new customers added in the period minus any\ncustomers who have not made a purchase in the last 364 days. Net sales per\nactive customer for fiscal 2019 increased 10.4% year over year to $360. As a\nreminder, net sales per active customer for any period equals that period's\ntrailing four-quarter net sales divided by the number of active customers at\nthe end of said period.\n\nNet sales per active customer in fiscal 2018 and first three quarters of 2019\nbenefited by approximately $7 to $8 from the inclusion of the extra week in Q4\n2018 without any corresponding increase in active customers. Q4 gross margin\nincreased 320 basis points to 24.1%. For the full year, gross margin increased\n340 basis points to 23.6%. As we have shared previously, our goal is to\ndeliver gradual and incremental gross margin expansion on an annual basis.\n\n2019 gross margins benefited from growth in average order values, high\nAutoship sales, increasing mix from our newest verticals and the overall\nleveraging of our cost structure. Q4 operating expenses, which include SG&A\nand advertising and marketing, were $386.8 million or 28.6% of net sales. For\nthe full-year 2019, operating expenses totaled $1.4 billion or 28.8% of full-\nyear net sales. SG&A, which comprises all fulfillment costs, customer service,\ncredit card processing fees, corporate G&A, public company costs and corporate\npayroll, including share-based compensation, totaled $284.9 million in the\nfourth quarter or 21% of net sales.\n\nExcluding share-based compensation and public company costs such as D&O\ninsurance and increased audit and legal services, SG&A was 17.2% of net sales\nin the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 15.8% last year. For full-year 2019,\nSG&A was 20% of net sales compared to 16.7% in 2018. Excluding share-based\ncompensation and public company costs, SG&A was 16.8% of net sales in 2019,\ncompared to 16.3% in 2018. We continue to aggressively manage our SG&A cost\nstructure.\n\nThe operational areas of SG&A, fulfillment and customer service represents\nmost of this line item. In these areas, we have successfully scaled our\nheadcount and reduced our related expenses as a percent of net sales by 20\nbasis points in 2019. The rate of growth we saw in SG&A in 2019 in excess of\nour net sales growth was almost exclusively related to the share-based\ncompensation and the additional professional services and other costs\nassociated with becoming and being a public company. As we look forward, we\nbelieve we will continue to scale SG&A and that on a fully loaded basis,\nannual SG&A as a percentage of net sales should decline versus fiscal 2019.\n\nLooking at SG&A, excluding share-based compensation and public company\nexpenses, we expect to see positive leverage materialize toward the back half\nof 2020. Q4 advertising and marketing was $101.8 million or 7.5% of net sales,\ntailing 330 basis points year over year. For the year, advertising and\nmarketing improved 230 basis points to 8.8% of net sales. As Sumit mentioned,\ncustomer retention remains strong, and we are pleased at our various growth\ninitiatives and investments in enhancing the customer experience are\ncontributing to ongoing expansion in the lifetime value or LTV of our\ncustomers.\n\nLTV measures the cumulative contribution profit we derive from each of our\ncohorts. When we compare our customer acquisition costs or CAC to lifetime\nvalues on our most recent marketing investments, we are finding equal or\nfaster payback periods that prove out the efficacy of our recent efforts.\nFourth-quarter net loss was $60.9 million as net margin improved 160 basis\npoints to negative 4.5%. Excluding share-based compensation of $45.9 million,\nour fourth-quarter net loss was $15.1 million, and net margin improved 460\nbasis points to negative 1.1%.\n\nFor the full year, net loss was $252.4 million and net margin improved 240\nbasis points to negative 5.2%. Excluding share-based compensation of $136.2\nmillion, our net loss was $116.1 million, and net margin improved 480 basis\npoints to negative 2.4%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss was $5.8 million, and our\nadjusted EBITDA margin improved 470 basis points to negative 0.4%. For the\nfull-year 2019, adjusted EBITDA loss was $81 million, and our adjusted EBITDA\nmargin improved 480 basis points to negative 1.7%.\n\nImprovements in both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our\nability to grow the top line, improvements in gross margin, scaling of\nadvertising and marketing and improved efficiencies in SG&A, all of which is\nconsistent with our strategy of long-term sustainable growth and margin\nexpansion. Adjusted EBITDA continues to be a managed output in that we invest\nthe profits we earn from repeat orders and the cash we generate from managing\nour working capital into new customer acquisition. In Q4, we generated a\npositive free cash flow of $60.42 million, with $74.3 million of positive cash\nfrom operations, offset by $10.1 million in capital investment. Q4 is a\nseasonally strong cash-generating quarter for us, whereas in Q1, we expect to\nbe a net user of cash.\n\nQ4 capital investments were primarily comprised of cash outlays for IT\nequipment, capitalization of internal and external labor and payments\nassociated with our new fulfillment centers in Dayton, Ohio, and Salisbury,\nNorth Carolina. For the full-year 2019, free cash flow was negative $2.1\nmillion, with $46.6 million of positive cash from operations, offset by $48.7\nmillion in capital investments. We ended the year with $212 million in cash\nand cash equivalents on the balance sheet. As evidenced by our full-year\nresults, in 2019, we successfully reinvested our profits from existing\ncustomers and cash from working capital to essentially breakeven on a free\ncash flow basis.\n\nNow I'll turn to guidance. Entering 2020, our team is singularly aligned on\nour mission, and we continue to see investment opportunities that will bolster\nour growth strategy and further extend our market leadership. As Sumit\nmentioned, the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has altered consumer\nshopping behavior in recent weeks. We have seen this at Chewy as concerned pet\nparents stocked up on necessities like food and other essentials, and as\ncustomers shift to their shopping from off-line to online channels in support\nof social distancing efforts.\n\nBeginning in late February, we saw an acceleration in sales, which has\ncontinued through today, and our first-quarter guidance reflects these trends.\nSo for the first quarter of 2020, we are expecting net sales between $1.50\nbillion and $1.52 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 35%\nand 37%. To reiterate Sumit's comments, we are still in a rapidly evolving\nsituation, one in which we are planning and adapting to swiftly and\nappropriately. And at this time, we do not believe it is prudent to provide\nfull-year guidance.\n\nWhile we are not giving full-year guidance at this time, I will leave you with\na few things to keep in mind as you build out your models. The high\noperational tempo required to meet peak demand periods like we are\nexperiencing now can impact efficiency on the fulfillment side. Also, when the\ncoronavirus situation abates, we may experience some moderation of demand as\ncustomers draw down their stockpiled supplies. As you would expect from us by\nnow, we are monitoring all relevant metrics, and we'll make decisions based on\nall available data, keeping the long-term strategic goals in mind.\n\nMy last modeling notice, a reminder that 2020, like 2019, will be a 52-week\nyear. In fact, we won't have another 53-week year until 2024. I will conclude\nby saying we are pleased with our full-year 2019 results and look forward to\nfull-year 2020. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for\nquestions.\n\nOperator?\n\n## Questions & Answers:\n\n  \n\n**Operator**\n\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Cassel with\nMorgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the acceleration that you've seen\nsince late February. Maybe give us some color on what the key drivers of that\nacceleration have been? Has it been existing customers placing larger orders\nor ordering more frequently, or have you actually seen an acceleration in new\ncustomer growth over the past four to five weeks?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Lauren, this is Sumit. I'll take that. So first of all, I think as we\nanticipate, our business continues to be recession-resilient during this time,\nand we're proud to be serving millions of customers who are relying on us. The\nacceleration in demand and the elevated demand patterns are coming from both\nsides.\n\nWe've seen our existing customers, 13.5 million of them, order in, but we've\nalso seen a meaningful lift in new customers coming in through the platform.\nSo at this point, it's a combination.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nOK, great. And then just any incremental color on not specific numbers, which\nis sort of the cadence of the acceleration. Was there a peak maybe two weeks\nago when things have moderated a bit? Are you still seeing really strong\ndemand even this week?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe are continuing to see strong demand, as Mario mentioned in the script,\nthrough the end of February up until as of yesterday.\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nThanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to ask about gross\nmargins. We saw the 320 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Can you just\nupdate us where you are on private label and how big you think that can\nbecome? And then anything to specifically point out in terms of where you saw\nsome other leverage and scale with partners? And then just on the COVID-19\nimpact, just trying to understand kind of your view and confidence in your\nability to handle the extra demand? And now that -- I understand why you\nwouldn't give guidance for the full year, but given the fact that you're two-\nthirds through the quarter, as you pointed out, why not give the 1Q profit\nguide? Thanks.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Doug, this is Sumit. I'll take that one. So private brands continues to\nbe a strategic vector for us. We continue to see private brands grow at the\nrate of 1.5 times.\n\nWe also continue to see private brands improve their profit margin roughly 500\nbasis points year over year. And most of that was led by our focus on hard\ngoods because as you remember from our strategy, we are careful about going\ninto market and not creating one-for-one SKU where customers might have\nloyalty to certain brands. But where product lines are commoditized or where\nwe can find differentiated value proposition, we are opportunistic about\noffering that assortment and convenience to customers. So that's how I would\nlook at that.\n\nIn terms of COVID, your second question was do we -- hang on, handling the\nextra demand. Can you repeat the second question, Doug?\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nConfidence in handling the extra demand that you're seeing in terms of\nfulfillment in the warehouses and then why not at least guide to profitability\nfor fiscal 1Q.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nYes. OK. Yes, yes. So super proud of the internal team at Chewy at this time\ncoming together in the way that we have.\n\nWe continue to take care of our team members, and our team members continue to\ntake care of our customers. Of course, demand requires executing to it, and\nwe're executing to our demand. We don't have concerns. All of the controllable\nfactors, which we control, we're maniacally focused on.\n\nAnd we believe our ability to execute and confidence toward executing that\ndemand remains high. In terms of not guiding to profit, we believe that we're\nstill in a rapidly evolving situation. We're seeing headwinds and tailwinds\nthat do not provide us the full clarity at this time. For example, we're\nmaking meaningful investments in personnel to make sure that our employees\nfeel valued at this time, and we're also investing in making sure that we are\nhiring 6,000 to 10,000 more people during this time.\n\nSo our level of operation and investment is as you would expect to see during\npeak periods. We've also invested in elevated sanitization and cleaning\nprocedures. On the flip side, if you look at the demand side, we're seeing\nincreased OE and increased participation from customers, but we're also seeing\nan increased meaningful lift in new customers that actually -- where we have\nto provide first-time discounts and Autoship discounts that are going out. And\nthen finally, we're just not sure of any kind of disruptions that might occur\nfrom this point onwards, so at this point, we don't believe it's prudent to\nprovide profit guidance.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nIs that 6,000 to 10,000 you mentioned, is that all in fulfillment centers? Or\nis some of that in customer service as well?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nIt is primarily in fulfillment centers to handle the demand shock that we've\nseen. We're seeing slightly elevated levels of backlog. And to handle that\nbacklog, we're upping our forecast at this point for labor, which we're proud\nof. I mean, supporting employment at this time in the marketplace is something\nthat we're proud that we're doing.\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P. Morgan -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Brian Fitzgerald** \\-- _Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst_\n\nThanks, guys. I wanted to ask about stock-outs and extended shipping times,\nwhat impacts that's having on demand. It does not seem to be dissuading\npurchases. We've done some simple polling, and it says, \"Hey, I may not be\ngetting the beef, but I'm switching over to chicken,\" that type of thing.\n\nCan you talk about is it dissuading purchases or causing breakage? Or is it\ninstead a substitution maybe into more private label? Can you unpack that a\nbit for us?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nSure. So we've seen no material disruption to supply chain or customer\nordering behavior. Our conversion for the most part remains intact. And the\nreason for that is as you intuited.\n\nEven though a small percentage of our portfolio is out of stock, most\ncustomers -- or two points there. One, we pre-empt and protect and reserve\ninventory allocation for our Autoship customers. And then two, most customers\nare able to either switch into a different pattern, design or brand. So the\noverall loss at this point is minimal, driven by out of stocks.\n\nWe're also jointly deep with planning and recovery efforts with our suppliers\nand vendors who are being super supportive at this point.\n\n **Brian Fitzgerald** \\-- _Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst_\n\nThanks, Sumit. Appreciate it.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.\n\n **Mark Mahaney** \\-- _RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nI have two questions, please. First, that increase in the -- is it APPA\nestimate of pet sales? Sumit, do you have any detail behind that? What would\nhave caused them to increase their estimates? Any color there? I assume you\nprobably have a little bit of the background on that. And then in terms of the\nnew customers that have come on, you've talked about the acceleration in\ngrowth, greater-than-expected growth, whatever this quarter being, both\nexisting and the new customers. Do you have any read into what the quality of\nthese new customers is like in the first four, six weeks? Are they acting like\nnew customers have in the past? Is there anything that suggests that they are\ngoing to be less loyal, less spending in the future with you that they're\nmigrating faster or slower? Is there anything that suggest that they're going\nto act differently than your prior cohorts, or is it just too early to tell?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThank you, Mark. Both good questions. I'll take the second one first. It is\ntoo early for us to tell.\n\nWe know that we are offering the same great service and similar value\nproposition. Some of the core input metrics of AOE and units per order and\nbasket size and the mixing seems very similar to our existing cohorts. But\nthen again, we're acquiring these customers during duress and an unprecedented\ntime, and so it's hard for us to really calculate at this time how sticky\nthese customers are going to be or how much similarly they're going to behave\nthrough our existing cohorts. That being said, we are going to work very hard\non our side to ensure that we engendered long-term loyalty from this\nparticular cohort that we're acquiring during this time.\n\nSo that's sort of the checks and balances that I was talking about when I was\nanswering Doug's question earlier as well. In terms of the first question, I\nthink the increase is driven by a couple of different trends. One, there's a\nlot more awareness about pets. And as millennials come into the marketplace,\nthere's a higher degree of pet ownership that we're seeing from that segment.\n\nNumber two, we've always known and talked about the premiumization in this\nspace, which is actually pushing up ASPs for newer and fresher categories that\nare entering the marketplace right now that might mature over the next few\nyears. So likely a combination there. We continue to monitor and watch this\none.\n\n **Mark Mahaney** \\-- _RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst_\n\nOK. It's very interesting here. Thank you, Sumit.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.\n\n **Eric Sheridan** \\-- _UBS -- Analyst_\n\nThanks so much for taking the question, and thanks for the update, Sumit, from\nyou and the team. I hope everyone's family and friends are well dealing with\nwhat we're dealing with. I wanted to ask a question about the data-driven\nmarketing push. There's been a lot of dislocation in digital and the off-line\nadvertising over the last four to six weeks.\n\nYou guys have made a lot of investments around data-driven marketing. Is there\nanything you guys are doing in terms of changing the channels where you might\nbe allocating investments to drive positive ROI marketing decisions? Are you\narcing any changes in the way you're making investment, or are you seeing any\nchanges in ROI in the current environment? Thanks so much.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nEric, thank you for the question. I hope you're safe and well as well. I won't\nspeak to the specific channels for competitive sensitivity reasons. I will\nprovide overall color.\n\nWe have seen a strong influx of organic demand, and we're utilizing and\ndoubling down on our relationship and content-driven marketing in this time to\nbe able to reach consumers and utilizing those channels to be able to educate\nconsumers, not only on the benefit of health and wellness but also on how to\nengage with pets during stay at home. So what that's done to us is it's driven\n-- we've taken advantage of this period and actually scaled back on marketing,\nwhere we believe it's not prudent to overspend during this time and are\nbanking on those efficiencies during this time, fully realizing that we don't\nreally, really, really know the quality of the cohort that we're acquiring, so\nwe might have to go back and actually invest a little bit of that back into\nretention. But we'll continue to be data-driven and disciplined around that as\nwell.\n\n **Eric Sheridan** \\-- _UBS -- Analyst_\n\nThank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Erin Wright** \\-- _Credit Suisse -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks. How big is your pharmacy segment now? Does that include\nprescription, as well as over-the-counter therapeutics? And are you seeing\nmore meaningful traction just in the current environment? Are veterinarians\nmore willing to work with you in light of the COVID disruption?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nErin, I'll start with the second one. We're not seeing material disruption at\nthis point. There are a couple of things that we're observing in the\nenvironment and the field right now. We're seeing vets more and more either\nreduce their hours or reduce the availability of services to more critical-\ntype services.\n\nThat being said, parasiticides and heartworm that drive primarily the share in\nthe category, we haven't seen a -- we actually have seen continued growth, an\nacceleration across the pharmacy business for us during this time, fully\nrealizing we're in peak. I think another thing that we are benefited by is our\nscripts that are on Autoship continue to be fulfilled. And on the flip side --\nand we haven't seen a drop in approval rates during this time. So on a macro\nlevel, we're not seeing much.\n\nHeartworm prescription is where you do need to go see the vet. And if the vet\nis closed, if there was any impact, we wouldn't be seeing it right now because\nthere's a bit of a lag because only the scripts that are expiring in the last\nfew weeks would be subject to that particular condition. So hopefully, that\nprovides a little bit of a color. Overall, we continue to see strong demand\nand the same acceleration in our Rx business as well.\n\nAnd then in our pharmacy, when we talk about pharmacy, we speak only\nspecifically prescription. We don't consider -- we're not counting OTC drugs\nas part of that.\n\n **Erin Wright** \\-- _Credit Suisse -- Analyst_\n\nOK, great. And then we also noticed -- this is another healthcare question,\nbut we also noticed you had a meaningful presence at VMX this year for the\nfirst time. Are you seeing material traction when establishing those formal\nrelationships with veterinarians and utilization of your prescription\nmanagement platform? I guess can you speak to sort of the economics behind\nsome of those relationships directly with the veterinarians where you've been\nable to establish those?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nGood question. We were at VMX because we continue to believe that we are a\nbrand that can drive meaningful penetration into the category by educating\nconsumers and driving more and more consumers to visit vet clinics, which then\nexpands the overall share of the TAM that is currently available, not only by\nincreasing the visits but also increasing repeat purchase rates for\nprescription. On the basis of that, we were there displaying our products that\nessentially go toward educating customers. We were also showcasing our\nproducts that we've developed for vet offices and for vets to be able to\nincrease their productivity in office and also to invite them to write for\nPetMD, which is a tremendous asset that they engage with that provides benefit\nback into our customers, and the vets actually are compensated for that.\n\nSo there's a lot in the evolution right now. We were pleased to be there. We\nwill continue to talk about how we can add meaningful value and also find\nopportunities where we can meaningfully partner with veterinarians but still\nearly in the journey there.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Deepak Mathivanan** \\-- _Barclays -- Analyst_\n\nGuys, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. So first, Mario,\ncan you elaborate a little bit on the first-quarter guidance? March\naccelerated nicely compared to Feb. Are you expecting acceleration in April in\nyour outlook? And is there any way you can kind of maybe quantify the March\ntrends versus Feb? And then a big-picture question for Sumit.\n\nWhere do you think online-offline mix would be in the post COVID-19 world? Do\nyou expect any meaningful disruption to the off-line channels that could\naccelerate the online penetration gains in the next, say, 12 to 18 months?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nDeepak, good to talk to you. To your question on what we expect in April,\nlook, we just provided guidance. And the fact is that we are operating in an\nunprecedented time, and the situation is evolving as we speak. So at this\ntime, I think we're comfortable providing the guidance that we just shared a\nfew minutes ago, and there's probably nothing more to add in terms of speed or\nvelocity for April.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nDeepak, this is Sumit. In terms of the second question, we've always\nmaintained the data that we've known is the online penetration should get to\nnorth of 20%, 25% over the next couple of years. We remain bullish on that\ntrend. We don't know why online penetration cannot get north of 35%, 40%, 45%.\n\nAnd occurrences like the one that we're in right now provide motivation and\ntailwinds to a shift in consumer pattern and behavior. We are yet to obviously\nsee how much of that is going to be sticky over the long term, but there's\ndefinitely going to be an impact here over the long term.\n\n **Deepak Mathivanan** \\-- _Barclays -- Analyst_\n\nOK. Thanks, guys. Very helpful.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Kelley with Nomura. Your line is open.\n\n **Mark Kelley** \\-- _Nomura Instinet -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Two quick ones. The first one, just on the acceleration\nthat you're seeing.\n\nCurious if it's concentrated in the hardest hit areas like in New York, New\nYork City area. Or is it broader than that? And second, I'd love to hear what\nyou guys are seeing on the advertising front, given that your ad budget is\nfairly broad. You gave some good color on the D&P a bit, but curious where are\nyou seeing the biggest opportunities with less demand on the advertising\nfront. Thank you.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nHey, Mark, good to hear from you. No, we're not seeing any major\nconcentrations in the way that that demand is right now segregated. We're\nseeing a fairly uniform lift across the country, and we're fulfilling that\nacross our fulfillment centers all across the country. In terms of advertising\nchannels, I will refrain from speaking specifically to the advertising\nchannels, again, for sensitivity reasons.\n\nBut as you would expect, I mean, people are -- folks have more time to be able\nto engage with content-driven channels. And we are fairly, fairly observant of\nthat, and we're adapting to our strategy in a similar manner and also pulling\nback on channels where we don't believe is optimal due to the organic nature\nof people translating their queries and, therefore, being able to find us in\nan organic fashion. Hopefully, that provides some help.\n\n **Mark Kelley** \\-- _Nomura Instinet -- Analyst_\n\nIt does. Thank you, Sumit.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nThanks. Just on the headcount side, if you took the midpoint of your headcount\nhiring, that would be a 67% increase from the February. And I'm just curious\nhow you think about the efficiency of those hires, and there's been a lot of\nconversations around the cost of hiring right now. Give us a sense of how\nyou're able to build that out with controlling the expense scale.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe continue to see headcount leverage across our businesses that are stable\nand mature across corporate headcount, and we're very prudent and very\ndisciplined in the way that we invest for that headcount. To give you a\nperspective, we're a company of somewhere between 13,000, 14,000 employees.\nAnd our corporate, even at this point, at being the scale that we are, is\nroughly 1,200 people. So most of our investments are in fulfillment and\ncustomer service.\n\nAnd we are continuing to invest in our fulfillment capabilities and customer\nservice to be able to service customers because that really is our moat in the\nway that we earn trust and maintain long-term loyalty.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nAnd when you think about the positive momentum you're seeing, does that give\nyou more conviction to experiment and look at adjacent spaces where you're at?\nOr do you say, in this period, just stay focused on your core mission right\nnow, which is the core products you're serving today?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nWe continue to remain focused in making sure that experience is protected and\nour services are coming across to customers in a high-fidelity, high-accuracy\nmanner.\n\n **Brent Thill** \\-- _Jefferies -- Analyst_\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nYes. I think my question might have been touched on at several other places.\nBut as you've seen an acceleration in Q1, particularly as we've come into\nstay-at-home and work-at-home environment, are you also seeing a drop in the\nmarketing costs to acquire those customers, both from the fact that there are\nmore customers coming in the door? But additionally, have other companies\npulled out of marketing channels that have allowed you to now make less\nexpensive options available?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nBoth of those assumptions are correct. I won't go into quantifying each of\nthem versus the other. But yes, there is a higher degree of marketing\nefficiency and a greater yield, and the dollar invested is going much further.\nBut then again, remember, we are not sure of the quality of the cohort that\nwe're acquiring, so we stand ready to ensure that we're engaging with\ncustomers and reinvesting for long-term retention purposes.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nWell, I know you said that there was a little bit of what you think of this\nkind of panic buying or hoarding mentality that people were building up\nsupply. Of your new customers coming in, were they at a similar percentage\nthat were signing up for your Autoship as normal?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nMore or less, yes.\n\n **Nat Schindler** \\-- _Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst_\n\nYes. OK. Thank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Your line\nis open.\n\n **Oliver Wintermantel** \\-- _Evercore ISI -- Analyst_\n\nThanks very much. Yeah. And just on the existing customers that are now\nspending more, is it more ticket or traffic? So in other words, is it more do\nthey spend more, or do they just come more often right now? And the related\nquestion to that is, of the sales, is that mostly consumable? Or do you also\nsee hard goods in pharma sales?\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\nHi, Oliver, this is Mario. I'll take that one. It's a combination of both. So\nexisting customers buying up, so bigger baskets and also placing more orders.\n\nIn terms of what we're seeing in the mix of what they're buying, it is, as in\nthe past, we see a larger uptick -- a greater percentage of the sales being on\nthe consumable side, and it's the kind of behavior you would expect if you're\nstocking the pantry.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nI can provide some more color there. So you're seeing essentials as No. 1.\nWith also the pet adoption trend that's up, so a lot of new pets being brought\nhome, we're seeing a healthy uptick on the hard goods side, everything that a\npet parent would need to service that need.\n\nAnd then the category that might be really impacted at this time across the\nindustry is truly discretionary spend such as pet tech.\n\n **Operator**\n\nYour next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair. Your line is\nopen.\n\n **Dylan Carden** \\-- _William Blair and Company -- Analyst_\n\nThanks very much. Just curious, reading some things to suggest things,\nparticularly like fostering and adoption is maybe up in this environment, are\nyou seeing -- of the new customers coming in, can you tell how many of those\nare actually new pet owners as well? And then can you just remind us sort of\nwhat happened in the last recession as per the acceleration in this space,\nsort of what drove that and what maybe you're expecting from here?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nCould you repeat the question, please? We didn't quite catch it.\n\n **Dylan Carden** \\-- _William Blair and Company -- Analyst_\n\nSorry about that. Yeah, just curious if you're seeing any -- of the new\ncustomers coming in, in this environment, if you can tell how many are -- is\nalso new pet owners and if there's any sort of reason to suggest that might be\na stickier long-term customer and then why the industry itself accelerated in\nthe last recession. What was sort of the driving force behind that?\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nSo we haven't really gone back to the drawing board and pulled that data. It\nwould be dependent upon customers creating a pet profile and telling us really\nhow many are new pet parents, so it's a little bit harder to sort of really\nget at that right now as we're focused on really handling the demand shock and\nmaking sure that our experience and fulfillment remains intact. On the\nincrease, I mean, the fact that the nature of this business is recurring\nstaple purchases, and during this time, attention and care for pets actually\ngoes up, a combination of all of that is what, in our mind, maintains and\ndrives the spending patterns during times like these.\n\n **Operator**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for the\nquestion-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to management for\nclosing remarks.\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nThanks all for the continued interest in Chewy. Please stay safe. Stay\nhealthy. And we will talk to you again in June.\n\nThank you.\n\n **Operator**\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\n**Duration: 56 minutes**\n\n## Call participants:\n\n **Bob LaFleur** \\-- _Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital\nMarkets_\n\n **Sumit Singh** \\-- _Chief Executive Officer_\n\n **Mario Marte** \\-- _Chief Financial Officer_\n\n **Lauren Cassel** \\-- _Morgan Stanley -- Analyst_\n\n **Doug Anmuth** \\-- _J.P.

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/hg-personal-informatik-payroll-\nacquisition-merger/) __\n\nU.K. private equity firm Hg is reportedly set to acquire small business\npayroll software company Personal & Informatik (P&I) several years after first\nacquiring the firm then divesting a majority stake.\n\nReports in the [Financial\nTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/fecaabfe-2589-11ea-9305-4234e74b0ef3) (FT)\nsaid Hg had first acquired P&I, based in Germany, in 2013 from Carlyle. At the\ntime, P&I was valued at about $485.8 million. Three years later, the company\ndivested a majority stake in P&I to\n[Permira](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2017/permira-\nacquires-10-percent-stake-in-klarna/), a deal which valued the firm at up to\n$998.1 million, reports said, citing unnamed sources.\n\nHg plans to again acquire P&I, although Permira will reportedly retain a\nminority stake in the company.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much Hg would pay to regain the payroll company, which is in\nthe midst of a cloud migration for its payroll software.

Maid\nPark on Tuesday, October 22, 2019 in Houston, Texas.\n\nCooper Neill | Getty Images\n\nFive Major League Baseball teams are set to spend more on their top two\nplayers next season than some ball clubs spend on their entire 26-man roster\nwith several star players winning record contract deals at the MLB's winter\nmeetings in San Diego this week.\n\nWith pitcher Gerrit Cole [reportedly](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/gerrit-\ncole-agrees-to-historic-324-million-deal-with-yankees-reports.html) agreeing\nto a 9-year contract worth a whopping $324 million and reigning World Series\nMVP Stephen Strasburg landing a 7-year deal valued at $245 million, the New\nYork Yankees and Washington Nationals will be doling out more for their top\ntwo players than some teams spend on their entire 26-man team.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are the\nother three teams paying top dollar for their two highest-paid players.\n\nVIDEO1:3501:35\n\nMajor League Baseball makes record salary signings\n\nCole's contract, which was agreed to during the MLB winter meetings, would\nmake his deal the fourth-largest in MLB history \u2014 just behind Yankees\noutfielder Giancarlo Stanton's 13-year, $325 million contract.\n\nThe deal pays Cole an average of $36 million a year, [the highest average\nannual payout in the MLB, according to\nSpotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/contracts/).\n\nThe average annual value of Cole's contract, combined with Stanton's 2020\nsalary of $26 million next year, comes to more than the Baltimore Orioles' $59\nmillion payroll for all of its 26 players next year, according to a CNBC\nanalysis of data from [Baseball\nProspectus](https://www.baseballprospectus.com). It also exceeds the payroll\nfor the Miami Marlins, which stands at $58 million. The figures reflect\nopening day payrolls as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nWith pitcher Strasburg staying with the Nationals, the team will be spending\neven more than the Yankees on its top two highest-paid players. Strasburg\nagreed to a $245 million, 7-year deal, which comes to an average of $35\nmillion per year.\n\nCombined with pitcher Max Scherzer's 2020 salary of $35.9 million, the\nNationals are spending about $71 million between the two players. That exceeds\nthe 26-man opening day payroll of the Orioles, Marlins, Tampa Bay Rays and\nPittsburgh Pirates. The Rays and Pirates will both spend about $65 million for\nall of its 26 players next year.\n\nThe Angels made a [free agency splash](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/la-\nangels-and-anthony-rendon-reportedly-reach-a-245-million-7-year-\ndeal.html?&amp;qsearchterm=anthony%20rendon) of their own this week with third\nbaseman Anthony Rendon, agreeing to a 7-year deal worth $245 million. The\ncontract pays an average of $35 million a year, but just $25.5 million in\n2020, according to the Associate Press. He'll receive as much as $38 million\nin later years. Rendon won't even be the highest-paid player on the team. That\ndistinction goes to Mike Trout and Albert Pujols, who will make $37.7 million\nand $29 million, respectively, in 2020.\n\nThe specifics of Strasburg and Cole's contracts and annual salaries have not\nbeen officially announced or confirmed yet. The Astros and Red Sox will spend\n$68 million and $62 million, respectively, on their two highest-paid players\nin 2020, according to the Baseball Prospectus data.\n\nVIDEO1:4301:43\n\nBaseball fans outraged over Nike's new MLB jerseys\n\n[The Exchange](https://www.cnbc.com/the-exchange/)\n\nAs of 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, the Yankees' 26-man opening day payroll was just\nover $232 million, which positions the Yankees as the highest-paid team for\n2020 thus far. To be sure, team spending could rise even more as clubs finish\nfilling out their rosters ahead of spring training. In 2019, the Yankees had\nthe second-highest team payroll coming in at almost $204 million, behind only\nthe Boston Red Sox.\n\nAccording to its website, Baseball Prospectus tracks \"Major League contracts,\nbonuses, service time and franchise values\" and that its information is\nunofficial and \"collected from published reports and sources in and around the\ngame.\" Until official annual salary numbers are released by the teams,\nBaseball Prospectus uses average annual value as a placeholder, spokesman Jeff\nEuston said in an email.\n\n _-CNBC 's _[_Jabari

It just so happens, though,\nthat paying employees can be a royal pain, what with incredibly diverse labor\nlaws across all 50 U.S. states. While large, Fortune 500 employers have a bevy\nof options, from traditional firms like ADP to newer entrants like Workday,\nsmall and medium businesses (SMBs) face the brunt of the challenge \u2014 too small\nto be attractive to the biggest players, but still responsible for following\nthe complexity of U.S. labor law.\n\n[Gusto](https://gusto.com) was founded to solve that problem for SMBs, and so\nfar, it has seen strong adoption. The company crossed the 100,000 customer\nbarrier in the past year, out of an estimated six million small businesses in\nthe United States. \u201cI feel like we are still at the beginning stages,\u201d\n[Gusto\u2019s ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/gusto) founder and CEO Josh\nReeves told TechCrunch.\n\nIt may be early innings, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from Gusto\u2019s burgeoning\ncap table. The company announced today that it has raised $200 million of\nventure capital from wealth manager [Fidelity\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/fidelity-investments) Management &\nResearch Company and Generation Investment Management, which was founded by\nformer U.S. Vice President Al Gore to create a vehicle for \u201csustainable\u201d\ninvestments.\n\nIn addition to the new capital, Gusto has added its first independent board\nmember in the form of Anne Raimondi, a current Asana and former SendGrid board\nmember who was SVP of Operations for customer experience SaaS platform\nZendesk.\n\nThe new infusion of capital will be used for scaling the company\u2019s product and\nteam. \u201cI like to take complex systems and take them apart and make them\nbetter,\u201d Reeves explained about both the complexity of payroll and the\ncomplexity of operating a growing workforce of his own.\n\nWhile Gusto\u2019s central product is payroll, Reeves sees two other product arcs\nhe intends to develop more in the coming years as the company scales. One arc,\n[which we talked about last year](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/gusto-\nflexible-pay/), is fintech features like [Flexible\nPay](https://gusto.com/company-news/flexible-pay-choose-your-own-payday), a\nproduct that allows employees to receive their unpaid wages in advance, with\nthe goal of reducing reliance on usurious payday lenders. The other product\narc is healthcare and helping SMBs offer insurance benefits to their\nemployees. \u201cWe want to be a force for universal healthcare,\u201d Reeves said.\n\n> [Disrupting the paycheck, Gusto\u2019s Flexible Pay allows employees to pick when\n> they get paid](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/gusto-flexible-pay/)\n\nAs Gusto explores additional products built around its payroll service, it has\nsought to expand its engineering R&D team. The company announced recently that\nit will open an R&D office in New York City in September, which it hopes will\nbe able to both execute on these two products as well as others not yet\nplanned. Today, Gusto has more than 1,000 employees in San Francisco and\nDenver.\n\nThat employee growth has also led to new executives joining the company\nrecently.

Images\n\n  \n\nIn times of market turmoil, one group of stocks that investors can count on to\ndeliver reliable income growth is the Dividend Aristocrats: an elite group of\ncompanies that have produced at least 25 consecutive years of dividend hikes.\n\nDuring the 2010s, these high-quality stocks returned an average of 14.75% per\nyear, besting the S&P 500 by 1.2 percentage points. A big reason for the\nDividend Aristocrats' outperformance, especially over the long term, is the\nhigh dividend component of their returns.\n\nStudies by Standard & Poor's have shown that more than one-third of the long-\nterm total return of stocks comes from dividends. In the case of the\nAristocrats, many of them traditionally don't boast attractive yields for new\nmoney. But investors that stick with them over the long haul are rewarded with\ngrowing \"yields on cost\" over time.\n\nReliable payouts also help make this group less risky than most other stocks.\nFor instance, volatility of the Dividend Aristocrats' returns during the\n2010s, as measured by standard deviation - a measure of how widely or narrowly\nprices are dispersed compared to an average - was more than 9% lower than the\nS&P 500.\n\nThat doesn't make them invulnerable from market downturns. A number of\nDividend Aristocrats have gone on discount, losing 10%, 20%, even 30% of their\nvalue since the start of the bear market. But they offer more than cheap\nprices - they offer real value, both in higher-than-usual yields as well as\nsnap-back potential once the market rebounds.\n\nHere are 19 Dividend Aristocrats that should appeal to investors who want\nsafety and reliably rising dividends at discounted prices.\n\n### SEE ALSO: [64 Dividend Stocks You Can Count On in\n2020](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T018-S001-64-best-\ndividend-stocks-you-can-count-on-in-2020/index.html?rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# AbbVie\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C.GEmQ734pHaWCNXnb9pjw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/11cea9ce0db84cada50580231c186e23)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $111.1 billion\n\nDividend yield: 6.3%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -20.1% (vs. -22.4% for the S&P 500)\n\nAbbVie\n([ABBV](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=ABBV&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $75.24) expects that its\npending $63 billion merger with Allergan\n([AGN](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=AGN&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)) will offset slowing growth of\nits [blockbuster\ndrug](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T052-C000-S001-biggest-\nblockbuster-drugs-of-all-time.html?rid=SYN-yahoo&utm_source=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_medium=referral) Humira. AbbVie initially said the merger, which is\nexperiencing coronavirus-related delays in closing, would create a combined\nbusiness that would generate more than $30 billion in sales this year, then\nhigh-single-digit growth into the foreseeable future. (The current economic\nturmoil likely will dampen those expectations somewhat.)\n\nAbbVie develops drugs for autoimmune diseases, cancer, virology (including HIV\nand Hepatitis C) and neurological disorders. And in fact, one of the company's\nHIV drugs (Kaletra) is being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile,\nAllergan is best-known for its cosmetic drug Botox and its dry-eye treatment\nRestasis. Wall Street firms like Allergan's strong Botox-related cash flows,\nwhich they think will bolster ABBV's growth opportunities.\n\nThe post-acquisition-related debt load will be high at $95 billion, but AbbVie\nexpects to trim $15 billion to $18 billion of debt by the end of 2021 while\nalso realizing $3 billion of pre-tax cost synergies. The combined business\ngenerated $19 billion in operating cash flow last year.\n\nABBV shares look cheap at just 7.5 times forward-looking earnings estimates,\nwhich is modest compared to the company's historical average forward P/E of\n12. Dividend growth investors will like AbbVie's 48 consecutive years of\npayout hikes; a conservative payout ratio of 48% that provides flexibility for\ndividend growth and debt reduction; and a five-year annual dividend growth\nrate of 18.3%. ABBV also is among the highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrats at\nnorth of 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\n### SEE ALSO: [Where Is the Stock Market Headed? 14 Wall Street Pros Sound\nOff](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T038-S001-where-is-the-\nstock-market-headed-wall-street-pros/index.html?rid=SYN-yahoo&utm_source=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# Aflac\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/N.gTV08Bk.OeMMFtUjrPYw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/01b9192edc5cd4f84b40a964113fdbae)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $26.2 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.1%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -29.7%\n\nAflac\n([AFL](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=AFL&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $36.26) offers supplemental\nhealth insurance and life insurance to more than 50 million customers\nworldwide. While many people are well aware of the Aflac brand (and its duck)\nin the U.S., the company is a market leader in Japan, where it provides\nsupplemental medical and/or cancer insurance to one of every four households.\nAFL recently expanded its product lines to include accident, disability and\nlong-term care insurance and launched vision and dental insurance products\nthis year.\n\nDemand for Aflac's products is rising due to steadily increasing health care\ncosts here and in Japan. The expanding self-employed workforce in the U.S. was\ncreating a growth opportunity, too, though the coronavirus outbreak and its\neffect on employment is likely to blunt that in the short term.\n\nAflac has delivered 11% annual EPS growth over the past three years while\nkeeping debt extremely low at just 17% of capitalization. That has helped the\ncompany keep up a streak of 38 consecutive dividend hikes, including a 3.7%\nincrease in early February to 28 cents per share that keeps it in the ranks of\nthe Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nAFL shares trade at 8 times forward earnings estimates, with 2020 profits\nexpected to stay flat with 2019 before improving by about 4% next year. It's\nalso trading at 0.9 times book value, compared to a historical ratio of 1.4\ntimes book.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Stephen Scouten rated Aflac as one of his top 2020\nfinancial service industry picks in January. Naturally, the stock has seen a\nfew price-target downgrades to reflect its losses as it dropped with the rest\nof the market, but analysts have otherwise been standing firm on their\nstances. One exception: RBC Capital analyst Mark Dwelle upgraded AFL from\nUnderperform (equivalent of Sell) to Sector Perform (equivalent of Hold).\n\n### SEE ALSO: [15 Dividend Cuts and Suspensions Chalked Up to the\nCoronavirus](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T018-S001-15-dividend-\ncuts-and-suspensions-coronavirus/index.html?rid=SYN-yahoo&utm_source=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fyH92ddwSS9g2svmRIcn_A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/4cca60b1adbed899aa461cd54615863d)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $40.0 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.1%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -13.3%\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\n([WBA](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=WBA&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $45.16) was challenged by\nfalling generic drug prices and reimbursement pressures from third-party\npayers last year, but the company expects to boost 2020 performance by\ntrimming $1.5 billion from expenses, strengthening its digital partnership\nwith Microsoft\n([MSFT](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=MSFT&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)) and partnering with Kroger\n([KR](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=KR&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)) and LabCorp\n([LH](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=LH&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)) to drive traffic to stores.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst AJ Rice earlier this year wrote that the company's\nprescription growth was likely to re-accelerate in 2020 as a result of its\nexpanded relationship with UnitedHealth Group\n([UNH](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=UNH&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)) in the Medicare Part D space.\n\nBut Walgreens suddenly finds itself positioned well for a different reason:\nIt's one of the few retailers still allowed to conduct business during many\nstates' stay-at-home orders and other partial closures amid the coronavirus\noutbreak. That's because Walgreens deals in prescriptions, health care\nproducts and basic staples that people are increasingly loading up on as they\nprepare to quarantine themselves. No surprise, then, that WBA has held up very\nwell in this bear market.\n\nHowever, Walgreens' stock still trades on the cheap, at just 11 times forward-\nlooking earnings estimates (versus a historic 15 forward P/E) and 0.3 times\nsales. Meanwhile, WBA has improved its payout for 44 consecutive years, firmly\nentrenching it among the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. Better still, its dividend\naccounts for just 44% of its profits, giving Walgreens plenty of room to\nexpand it once the world is in better economic straits.\n\n### SEE ALSO: [25 Dividend Stocks the Analysts Love the\nMost](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T018-S001-25-dividend-\nstocks-the-analysts-love-the-most/index.html?rid=SYN-yahoo&utm_source=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# Nucor\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l0VTySRUH48WZLmiDxn2tw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/0d3ab85e0132ecc2ae09b9e44b264a94)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $10.5 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.6%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -26.8%\n\nNucor\n([NUE](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=NUE&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $34.92) is North America's\nlargest and most diversified steelmaker; the company operates 25 steel mills\nrepresenting 27 million tons of annual production capacity.

Nucor plans to boost profits by moving up the\nvalue chain with more value-added products and expanding its sales channels.\n\nWhile Wall Street's pros are writing bearish notes left and right in this\nenvironment, Nucor is actually [enjoying a few analyst\nupgrades](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T052-S001-7-stock-\npicks-that-analysts-are-actually-upgrading/index.html?rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral).\n\nOn March 30, Goldman Sachs' Matthew Korn upgraded Nucor from Neutral\n(equivalent of Hold) to Buy, touting the company's \"strong\" balance sheet,\ndiverse portfolio of facilities and products, and flexibility in capital\nexpenditures.

This\nexceptional record of dividend growth is likely to continue due to Dover's\nmodest 31% payout, proven ability to convert most of its earnings to free cash\nflow and solid balance sheet.\n\nDOV shares typically aren't expensive to begin with, but a forward P/E below\n14 and a price-to-cash flow of 13.3 are both a few points below their\nhistorical norms.\n\n### SEE ALSO: [11 Best Stocks to Ride Out the Coronavirus\nOutbreak](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T052-S001-11-best-\nstocks-to-ride-out-the-coronavirus-scare/index.html?rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# Medtronic\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hmnU.mAxRATPWUowLqJLRA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/382ef042ad89bdeedfd4c8334435f584)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $123.4 billion\n\nDividend yield: 2.4%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -19.1%\n\nMedtronic\n([MDT](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=MDT&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $92.05) develops medical\ndevices and solutions for minimally invasive surgeries, cardiac and vascular\ntreatment, restorative therapies and diabetes management. The company operates\nin more than 150 countries; its products have improved outcomes for more than\n75 million patients.\n\nAnd particularly noteworthy right now: MDT is a leading manufacturer of\nventilators. In fact, it's in the process of more than doubling ventilator\nmanufacturing capacity to meet unprecedented coronavirus-related demand.\n\nMedtronic targets 8% annual EPS gains and a steadily rising dividend, which\nthe company will achieve by expanding its development pipeline and new product\nlaunches and increasing its foothold in emerging markets, where growth is\nconsistently in the double digits - an expectation that might need to be\nslimmed down somewhat, if only in the short term.\n\nNonetheless, this exceptional company has produced average annual dividend\ngrowth of 14% over the past five years, thus the payout has nearly doubled in\nthat time. Medtronic has been among the ranks of the Dividend Aristocrats for\nnearly two decades, by virtue of 42 consecutive dividend increases.\n\nMDT currently trades at a lower forward P/E and price-to-cash flow multiples\nthan its five-year averages. But Medtronic isn't just about value - it's about\nthe potential for future growth well after this pandemic has passed. SunTrust\nanalyst Kaila Krum (Buy, $130 price target), for instance, is bullish about\nthe company's renal denervation therapy, writing, \"After a turbulent history\nof US pivotal trial failures and efforts by several companies in renal\ndenervation, we're pleased to see steady progress towards FDA approval. We\nthink Medtronic will be first to market and that the opportunity could be $1B\nmarket by 2026.\"\n\n# Emerson Electric\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IOCM9w3FXxOeZSmbSLUAIg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/125092f9e6d15e85fcfdd0c08047c165)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $28.5 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.3%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -35.1%\n\nEmerson Electric\n([EMR](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=EMR&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $46.63) is a global\nmanufacturer of automated solutions for the chemicals, energy, power\ngeneration, pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries, which all make up\ntwo-thirds of its sales. EMR also provides commercial and residential\nsolutions for heating and cooling applications, commercial and industrial\nrefrigeration, and cold chain management.\n\nThe Automated Solutions business has an installed base of $115 billion worth\nof equipment, which drives recurring sales from equipment upgrades and service\ncontracts. The Commercial and Residential Solutions business is resilient\nthanks to the recession-resistant nature of its end-markets, not to mention\nits proprietary technology.\n\nEMR's problem right now is its connection to the energy sector, which is\ngetting hammered thanks to plummeting oil prices. That said, there's a real\ngrowth opportunity developing in its Industrial Internet of Things, which\nmanages things such as data collection and systems controls.\n\nEmerson Electric has raised dividends 63 years in a row, testifying to the\ncompany's ability to reward investors even during economic downturns. Dividend\npayout targeted at 50% of free cash flow leaves a margin for safety even if\ncoronavirus effects are worse than expected. The company had already been\nplanning for a challenging 2020 and has initiated multiple programs designed\nto trim expenses and bolster margins. It's further supported by a balance\nsheet rated \"A\" by Standard & Poor's.\n\nAnd EMR is genuinely cheap right now. Its forward P/E of 12.7 is roughly a\nthird cheaper than its five-year average, and its price-to-cash flow of 13.3\nis about a 40% discount to its historical average.\n\n### SEE ALSO: [30 Massive Dividend Increases From the Past\nYear](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T018-S001-30-massive-\ndividend-increases-from-the-past-year/index.html?rid=SYN-yahoo&utm_source=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_medium=referral)\n\n# Automatic Data Processing\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mpVxs5KAMcb3IPeUvVvS6w--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-\nus/kiplinger.com/4fec90a33e893cd1e44922867a30eaca)\n\nGetty Images\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $59.5 billion\n\nDividend yield: 2.6%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -24.0%\n\nAutomatic Data Processing\n([ADP](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=ADP&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $137.82) is a world-leading\nprovider of cloud-based human capital management solutions (HCM) for areas\nsuch as payroll processing, benefits administration, human resources,\nregulatory compliance and insurance services. The company serves over 810,000\nclients in 140 countries.\n\nADP benefits from this large installed customer base as well as strong client\nretention, with most customers averaging 11 years with company. These\ncharacteristics of its business support high recurring revenues and good\nmargins. Acquisitions and organic growth have enabled ADP to deliver 8% annual\nEPS growth over the past 10 years. Dividends have risen 45 years in a row,\nincluding a 3% uptick last year.\n\nIt's no wonder that ADP has taken a hit amid the bear market given what a\npotential recession could mean for many of its customers. That said, the\ncompany so far has tacked on expenses - in the form of a $1,000 check to every\none of its employees, to be sent out in April - rather than reduced headcount\nso far, which is an encouraging sign. And in general, ADP's entrenchment\nshould serve it well in an economic recovery.\n\nIn the meanwhile, ADP has an AA credit rating from agencies, low debt\nrepresenting just 17% of capitalization and robust free cash flow that grew to\n$2.2 billion last year. That's enough to cover the dividend twice over.\nMeanwhile, ADP's forward P/E and price-to-cash flow are both several points\nlower than their historical averages.\n\n# Ecolab\n\n  \n\nMarket value: $46.7 billion\n\nDividend yield: 1.2%\n\nPerformance since 2/19/20: -23.3%\n\nEcolab\n([ECL](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=ECL&ticker_type=S&page=stockTipsheet&rid=SYN-\nyahoo&utm_source=SYN-yahoo&utm_medium=referral), $161.40) is the worldwide\nleader in water treatments, hygiene and energy technology and services. The\ncompany provides water treatment processes and technologies to the food and\nbeverage, paper, life sciences and manufacturing industries and specialized\ncleaners and sanitizers to foodservice, healthcare, lodging and education\nindustries. In its process chemicals and water treatment business, Ecolab\nserves the oil and gas, refining and petrochemical industries.\n\nEcolab's earnings growth has been solid and consistent, averaging close to 12%\nannually over the past 10 years. Like some Dividend Aristocrats, ECL's yield\nisn't much to talk about, at 1.2% despite the stock's 24% drawdown. And\naverage annual payout growth of 7.3% over the past half-decade has been good,\nalbeit not great.\n\nBut it's a safe dividend that only represents 35% of profits. It's also paid\nby a company whose free cash flow could pay off its debt within four years.\nAnd while Ecolab is hardly inexpensive compared to the broader market right\nnow, it is cheaper than it has been on average by most metrics - P/E, forward\nP/E, price-to-cash flow and price-to-book.\n\n### SEE ALSO: [Every Warren Buffett Stock Ranked: The Berkshire

Vietnam\nBriefing\") Written by  [ Dezan Shira & Associates ](https://www.dezshira.com/)\nReading Time: 5 minutes\n\n_Foreign employers that want to attract and retain the best talent need to\nensure they understand payroll in Vietnam and coordinate salary structures\nwith HR management. Here, Vietnam Briefing explains the payroll basics and\nsome best practices for employers in the country._\n\nIn recent years, [foreign direct investment](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/fdi-in-vietnam-investment-by-sector.html/) (FDI) flows into\nVietnam have been on the rise as greater numbers of [foreign companies decide\nto establish businesses in the country](https://www.china-\nbriefing.com/news/vietnam-overtaking-china-us-export-manufacturing/).\nEmployers, however, need to develop a good understanding how human resources\nwork in the country. For many, salary structures are usually a beginning\npoint, particularly as it rationalizes wages and motivates staff.\n\n## **Compensation**\n\nFor Vietnamese employees that work in foreign companies in Vietnam,\ncompensation is determined through negotiations between the two parties.\nHowever, the compensation should be no lower than the [minimum monthly salary\nrates](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/new-minimum-basic-salary-social-\ninsurance-rates-vietnam.html/) as stipulated by the government.\n\nThe monthly minimum wage rates in Vietnam, updated in January 2019, are as\nimmediately below.\n\n[![Infographic: Vietnam Monthly Minimum Wages](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vietnam-Minimum-\nWages.jpg)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/04/Vietnam-Minimum-Wages.jpg)\n\nThe above minimum wage rates are only for Vietnamese employees that conduct\nthe most basic work in normal working conditions. Employees who have passed\nvocational training courses (i.e., company training courses) typically have\nwage rates that are at least seven percent higher than those mentioned above.\n\nEmployees who work extra hours are also paid for those extra hours based on\ntheir current hourly wages, as immediately below.\n\n[![Infographic: Vietnam Overtime Compensation](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vietnam-Overtime-\nCompensation.jpg)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/04/Vietnam-Overtime-Compensation.jpg)\n\nIn cases where an employee works extra hours at night, they are paid extra in\naccordance to the applicable regulations. Furthermore, employees who are given\ntime off in compensation for working extra hours will need to be paid the\ndifference between their wages during normal working hours and overtime work.\nFinally, employees who work night shifts should be paid at least 30 percent\nhigher than normal.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-\nresource-administration)\n\n  * [![Professional-Service_VB-icons-2017.jpg](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_VB-icons-2017.jpg)We can help you with Payroll](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-resource-administration)\n\nSalaries paid to Vietnamese staff working for foreign companies must be\ndenominated in Vietnamese Dong. Foreign employers may base salary rates in\neither Vietnamese Dong or US Dollars, but salaries that are based in US\nDollars must be converted into Vietnamese Dong.\n\nIn general, an employee\u2019s typical monthly salary package includes their gross\nsalary and mandatory insurance contributions. [Personal income\ntaxes](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/personal-income-tax-exemptions-\nand-reductions.html/) (PIT) will be levied on the balance after mandatory\ninsurance contributions have been deducted.\n\n## **Types of bonuses**\n\nBonuses are given to employees based on company earnings and performance and\nas a way of boosting company morale and productivity. There are various kinds\nof bonuses that a company may grant its employees throughout the year.\n\nFor example, a 13th month\u2019s salary is usually given as a kind of \u201cannual\nbonus\u201d by both local and foreign companies in Vietnam to employees that have\nworked with the company for at least one year. Employees that have worked at a\ncompany for less than one year are typically given a bonus that is prorated\nand based on their actual employment period.\n\nIn addition, there is also a special bonus called the \u201cLunar New Year\u201d bonus\n(or \u201cTet Bonus\u201d) that is often paid to employees prior to their leaving for\nthe [Lunar New Year holiday](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-\npublic-holidays-2019.html/).\n\nThe amount of any Tet Bonus will be dependent on both company and employee\nperformance, but the bonus typically ranges from smaller amounts of money (up\nto an entire month\u2019s salary) to larger amounts of money (up to an entire\nyear\u2019s salary) depending on the company progress and goals.\n\nApart from the larger annual bonuses mentioned above, employees may also be\ngiven smaller bonuses for [public holidays](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/vietnams-public-holidays-2019.html/) or other special days\n(e.g. _,_ International Labor Day or National Day).\n\nSenior management and other valued employees may be given bonuses during these\ndays as well, including in the form of share certificates with a vesting\nperiod, for which the corresponding stock can be sold only after the employee\nhad worked for the company for a certain amount of time.\n\nAll salaries and bonuses are subject to PIT in Vietnam.\n\n## **Allowances and benefits**\n\nApart from salary and bonuses, an employee may be entitled to several kinds of\nallowances and monetary or non-monetary benefits designed to retain staff.\nSome of these are subject to PIT.\n\nTaxable benefits include:\n\n  * Housing rent;\n  * Payments for power, water, and associated services for employees that amount to more than 15 percent of their total taxable income;\n  * Transportation allowances;\n  * Premiums for life insurance;\n  * Health care services;\n  * Entertainment fees; and\n  * Sports/athletics fees or membership fees to golf clubs, tennis courts, and other exclusive clubs.\n\nPrefixed lump sum amounts (or \u201c _khoan chi_ \u201d amounts) for telephone calls and\nservices, stationery, uniforms and per diem allowances are not subject to\ntaxes if the amounts are within the levels set out under the relevant\nregulations.\n\nForeigners that work in Vietnam are also exempted from PIT on various benefits\nsuch as relocation allowances for moving into the country, airfare to their\nhome country, and education fees for their children.\n\n## **Vietnamese Accounting Standards**\n\nLocal and foreign invested companies that conduct business in Vietnam are\nrequired to comply with [Vietnamese Accounting Standards](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/ifrs-vas-part-1-introduction-vietnamese-accounting-\nstandards.html/) (VAS) when recording their financial transactions.\nAdditionally, foreign companies can choose to manage two different sets of\naccounting records: one that is based on the VAS and another compiled\nspecifically for its overseas head office.\n\nFulfilling the relevant VAS requirements may prove to be a challenging task\nfor [foreign small and medium-sized enterprises](https://www.vietnam-\nbriefing.com/news/vietnams-industrial-zones-strategies-for-small-and-medium-\nenterprises.html/) that work with limited resources and choose to enter the\ncountry to save on manufacturing costs. The VAS requires that accounting\nrecords abide by the following:\n\n  * All documents must be translated into Vietnamese;\n  * The Vietnamese Dong must be used as the accounting currency;\n  * All records must comply with Vietnam\u2019s chart of accounts; and\n  * Several accounting reports must be printed on a monthly basis (as specified by relevant VAS regulations).\n\nThe above documents must be signed by the General Director of the company and\naffixed with the company seal prior to submission.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/accounting-\nreporting)\n\n  * [![Professional-Service_VB-icons-2017.jpg](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_VB-icons-2017.jpg)Learn more about VAS](https://www.dezshira.com/services/accounting-reporting)\n\nThe Vietnamese authorities have been working toward strengthening Vietnam\u2019s\ncorporate accounting system, yet enforcement has been relatively lax when it\ncomes to implementing full VAS compliance.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that provincial tax authorities may cite VAS\nnon-compliance as a basis for collecting additional taxes and recovering paid\n[value-added tax](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/calculating-value-\nadded-tax-vietnam.html/) (VAT) refunds.\n\nThe tax authorities can also penalize companies for non-compliance in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n  * Disallowing input VAT credits;\n  * Revoking any corporate income tax incentives; and\n  * Changing the methods and applicability of corporate income tax collection.\n\nAs such, companies are advised to double-check their accounting systems,\ntaking precautions to spot possible VAS non-compliance issues.\n\n_Note: This article was first published in June 2013, and has been updated to\ninclude the latest developments._\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/managing-payroll-vietnam.html/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * \n\n* * *\n\n**About Us**\n\n_[Vietnam Briefing](http://www.vietnam-briefing.com/) is produced by [Dezan\nShira & Associates](http://www.dezshira.com/).

We implemented proactive measures\nat all of our facilities to protect our people and delivery partners,\nincluding increased cleaning, and maintaining social distance, including\nbetween drivers and customers when making deliveries. __ __\n\n____\" The health of our people is our top priority, and it\u2019s important to us\nthat they remain home if they\u2019re sick or if they or someone in their home has\nhad a fever in the last 24 hours. To support our people during this time we\nhave increased entitlement to paid time off and are enabling people to take\nleaves of absence as appropriate. __ __\n\n____\" We also want to recognise our employees who are playing an essential\nrole for people at a time when many of the services that might normally be\nthere to support them are closed. To recognise the contribution our employees\nin the UK are making, we will be adding an additional \u00a32 per hour worked from\nnow through to the end of April. This is on top of our starting rate of \u00a310.50\nfor the London area, and \u00a39.50 for the rest of the UK. We will also increase\nthe overtime premium to 100% of hourly base rate for every overtime hour\nworked above 40 hours in a work week between now and end of April. __ __\n\n____\" As demand continues to increase, we are working to ensure we can\ncontinue to deliver to the most impacted customers while keeping our people\nsafe. Many of these customers have no other way to get priority items and we\nwant to be sure that we have the right resources in place to deliver on their\nneeds. We are prioritising the intake and dispatch of items most needed by our\ncustomers right now. These are items such as food, health and personal care\nproducts, books and items needed to work from home.\u201d\n\n### Covid-19: who can go to work?\n\nThis is the latest government advice for employers and employees:\n\n**Who can go to work?**\n\nThe new measures, in place for at least three weeks, tell Britons to only\nleave home to go to work \"where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be\ndone from home\".\n\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said those who cannot work from home\nshould go to work \"to keep the country running\".\n\nHe confirmed that people whose jobs has not already been shut down by the\ngovernment measures to date should continue to work but should only be\ntravelling to a workplace \"where that work can't be done at home\".\n\nHe said construction workers - many of whom work outdoors - could and should\ncontinue to go to work as long as they are able to remain two metres apart at\nall times.\n\nThe cabinet minister said: \"The judgement we have made is that in work, in\nmany instances, the two-metre rule can be applied.\n\n\"Where possible, people should work from home and employers have a duty to\nensure that people are more than two metre apart.\n\nAsked what staff should do if their employers told them to turn up when they\ndid not believe they were key workers, Mr Hancock said: \u201cWe have been\nincredibly clear about the rules. We strengthened the rules yesterday and\nessentially flipped the basis of the rules, so it's not \u2018Do whatever you like,\nso long as you don't do the following\u2019, it is \u2018Stay at home, unless you've got\na good reason\u2019. And we will also enforce against those rules.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said that the Construction Leadership\nCouncil had issued guidance to the industry.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt should continue where it can happen in a way that follows Public\nHealth England and industry guidance.\n\n\u201cWe urge employers to use their common sense when managing live projects and\nensuring that employees can follow the Government guidance and practice safe\nsocial distancing on site.\u201d\n\n**Staying at home**\n\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), however mild, stay\nat home and do not leave your house for seven days from when your symptoms\nstarted.\n\n**Sick pay**\n\nYou can get \u00a394.25 per week Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if you\u2019re too ill to\nwork. It\u2019s paid by your employer for up to 28 weeks.\n\nIf you are staying at home because of COVID-19 you can now claim SSP. This\nincludes individuals who are caring for people in the same household and\ntherefore have been advised to do a household quarantine.\n\nTo check your sick pay entitlement, you should talk to your employer, and\nvisit the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) page for more information.\n\n____\n\n### Tata\n\nA Tata Steel spokesperson said: \u201cAs you will know overall, European steel\ndemand is lower than normal. A number of steel-using manufacturers have paused\nproduction, including European car manufacturers. _ __ ___\n\n\u201cWe have therefore reduced production at some of our European mills to match\nthis lower demand. We will continue to operate all four blast furnaces across\nour two steelmaking hubs \u2013 in IJmuiden, the Netherlands, and Port Talbot,\nWales. However, liquid steel production will be reduced as a consequence of\nthe sudden drop in demand. _ __ ___\n\n\u201cWe are monitoring the situation carefully and we stand ready to review these\ndecisions based on market demand in the coming weeks. This is a fast-moving\nsituation and we are working closely with customers and suppliers to mitigate\nthese impacts as far as possible.\u201d\n\nTata Steel Steelworks in Port Talbot (Image: Matthew Horwood)\n\nRead more about how Tata is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic\n[here](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tata-steel-port-talbot-\ncoronavirus-18022180).\n\nOn the company website in regards to the safety measure put in place for\nemployees it reads: \"Our cross-company coronavirus steering committee,\ncomprising relevant internal experts, continues to meet daily and is\ncoordinating our response to the outbreak. We continue to take a range of\nproactive steps, based on our business continuity plans, which include:\n\n  * No visitors to our sites and all colleagues working from home as far as possible\n  * For our manufacturing colleagues we have further increased resources to increase hygiene and to reduce social contact\n  * Increasing capabilities to facilitate working from home across all functions\n  * Infection reporting processes in place and monitored daily\n  * Scenario planning for changes in demand as part of the business planning processes\"\n\n### Welsh Water\n\nA Welsh Water spokesperson said: \"As an essential service, a number of our\ncolleagues and contractors are designated \u2018key workers\u2019 and therefore need to\nkeep working in our communities to keep water and wastewater services going\nwhen our customers need it most. __ __\n\n____\n\n\"However, the safety of our employees and customers is our top priority. So\nwhen they are out working, colleagues are expected to adhere to all government\nand public health guidelines to stay safe, including observing appropriate\nsocial distancing measures, and are supplied with full personal protective\nequipment (PPE). We have issued new safety guidelines to our colleagues based\non a Covid-19 risk assessment. __ __\n\n____\n\n\"Where it is possible for our employees to work from home, they are doing so.\nFor instance, we have also taken steps to relocate more than 300 people in our\ncontact centre from its base in St Mellons, Cardiff, so that call operators\nare able to support customers with billing or operational queries from home.\n__ __\n\n____\n\n\"We are also continuing to support our colleagues in terms of their normal pay\nand conditions, we need all our people focused on providing essential water\nand sewerage services at this very difficult time. We are very mindful that\nthe distress being experienced by our customers and wider society are also\nimpacting on our people too, and we are doing all we can to be flexible and\nsupport them through this challenging period.\"\n\n### SA Brain\n\nJon Bridge, director of pub operations, said: \"We have a limited number of\nemployees continuing to work, most notably from our support centre and at\nDragon Brewery. We are of course complying with the social distancing\nguidelines and providing PPE equipment at the Brewery to ensure our beers are\navailable in the local supermarkets and our retained office teams are working\nsafely from home with dedicated support from our people team to ensure their\nwellbeing.\n\n\"As a family business we are doing everything in our power to support our\nteams through these unprecedented times. We are utilising the Government\u2019s\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme and ensuring all our teams are treated with\nthe fairness and respect they deserve, whether they were team members before\nthe Government cut-off date of the 28 February or joined our team after that\ndate. By retaining our hugely loyal team we will be able to serve our\ncustomers and communities far better when we get to the other side of this\nlockdown.\n\n\"We took every opportunity to share any PPE to local NHS trusts when first\nrequested. We have also actively supported numerous local charities and\nemergency services by donating over \u00a3125,000 worth of frozen food to those in\nneed.\"\n\nSA Brain said it had not let any of its employees go as a result of the\nlockdown or coronavirus pandemic.\n\n### It's time to thank our NHS workers\n\n![NHS heroes main\nimage.jpg](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17955139.ece/binary/0_NHS-\nheroes-main-image.jpg)\n\nIt is something that has touched all our lives.

The majority of our colleagues, including those in our contact\ncentre, are now working remotely from home but as the UK and Welsh governments\nhave identified banks and building societies as key services, we\u2019ve kept most\nof our branches open for our members albeit with reduced operating hours.\n\n\"While our branches are open, we\u2019re ensuring that the government social\ndistancing measures are enforced and they\u2019re stocked with hand sanitisers and\ncleaning wipes to support our precautionary approach.\n\n\"In line with the Government guidance, we are encouraging members to stay at\nhome and only attend a branch when absolutely necessary. We are of course open\nfor members who need to withdraw money for bills, rent or food, register a\nbereavement or deposit money to fund essential transactions. We\u2019re hoping that\nthis approach will help to safeguard our colleagues as far as possible while\nproviding necessary services for our members.\n\n\"We\u2019re keeping our colleagues regularly updated providing not only business\nrelevant information but also guides on working from home, dealing with\nquestions from children on coronavirus and mental health and wellbeing.\n\n\"We are committed to providing job security to our hard working colleagues,\nbut how we do that as this crisis develops may change. We will continue to run\nour Society in the long term interest of our colleagues and members and will\nreview our position over the coming months.\n\n\"Where colleagues have been unable to work, we\u2019re utilising our standard\nsickness approach to ensure they\u2019re looked after.\"\n\nPrincipality said it had not let any of its employees go due to the pandemic\nor lockdown.\n\n### Bluestone\n\nA spokeswoman for Bluestone said: \"The welfare of our staff and everyone\nconnected with Bluestone is paramount \u2013 and is always put first. On 23 March,\nwe closed Bluestone National Park Resort to guests and we have since announced\nthat the site is to be utilised as a Recovery Centre, helping to treat those\nin need and those recovering from COVID-19.\n\n\"We are supporting all of our staff and one of our key aims is to retain every\nemployee. We are utilising the Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\nand from 1 April we have furloughed staff, where we are unable to provide work\nbecause of the resort closure.\n\nThe holiday resort in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Image: Handout)\n\n\"As a Recovery Centre, a number of staff are continuing to provide security\nand management of some of the facilities on the site. We are working to ensure\nwe adhere to all guidelines and the highest standards of health and safety \u2013\nas well as staff wellness. We have revised our overall safety management plan,\nincluding working practices and risk assessments. We have updated our\nguidance, good practice and induction training in light of the ongoing\noutbreak, which all those working on the resort have to successfully complete.\nWe are committed to doing all that we can to support staff through this\ndifficult time.\n\n\"In line with Government guidance, we were very quick to identify those\nvulnerable employees or those living with someone vulnerable. We have also set\naside an emergency hardship fund to help those who are particularly affected,\ntogether with an Employee Support Line that our staff can access\nconfidentially to seek support on issues such as financial management, as well\nas access to counselling services. We continue to communicate regularly with\nour employees to provide information and signposting.\n\n\"We consider all our staff part of the Bluestone Family and we are determined\nto do all that we can to navigate the troubled waters ahead together.

We are also\nemphasising the importance of 2m/6ft distancing in our stores via in-store\nradio announcements and posters, and supporting this by closing every other\ncheckout.\n\n\"In addition to the above and to further protect our colleagues, we are\nadvising that one colleague only should be in store offices or staff rooms at\nany one time.\n\n\"We have provided hand sanitisers, gloves and face masks for colleague use\n(the last were delayed due to overwhelming demand, but should be reaching\nstores now); we are in the process of installing Perspex shield screens at all\ncheckouts across the business: this work is due for completion by the end of\nthis week.\n\n\"We are regularly updating colleagues on these measures and continue to advise\nthem to follow Government advice on social distancing and personal hygiene,\nparticularly handwashing. We have provided posters to be displayed in staff\nareas with this advice, alongside store cleaning practices.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn terms of workers who are having to self isolate because of being vulnerable\nthemselves or sharing a house with someone who is vulnerable, Iceland has been\nvery generous.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"We have advised all vulnerable or extremely vulnerable\ncolleagues (as defined by HM Government) to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks\nin line with current guidance, and we will pay them in full while they do so.\nThis applies to all colleagues who have more than one month\u2019s service with the\ncompany.\n\n\"We have also offered those living with extremely vulnerable family members\ntwo weeks\u2019 leave on full pay while we complete social distancing and colleague\nprotection measures in the workplace such as the installation of shield\nscreens at checkouts. We will keep this under review.\n\n\"We have extended eligibility for company sick pay so that all colleagues with\n1-12 months service are now entitled to two weeks company sick pay (which is\nequivalent to full pay). As noted above, vulnerable colleagues will receive 12\nweeks full pay in self-isolation.\"\n\nIceland said it had not needed to let anyone go because of the pandemic and\nhad in fact recruited 3,000 new members of staff across the UK.\n\n### Hoover\n\nA spokesperson for Hoover said: \u201cAll Merthyr-based employees that can work\nfrom home are home working (I.T, finance, fleet, payroll, quality,\nadministration) and we are continuing to run our Merthyr Distribution Centre\nwith around 45 employees spread across three shifts following all relevant\nsocial distancing and good hygiene practices contained in NHS and Government\nguidance. __ __\n\n\u201cEveryone in our Merthyr operation has been able to keep working with the\nvarious adjustments we have made and no employees have been let go or\nterminated as a result of COVID-19. __ __\n\n\u201cFinally, we are imminently launching an internal comms campaign to\neffectively communicate with all employees and provide them with advice and\nguidance on maintaining their mental and physical wellbeing while at home.\u201d\n\n### Go Compare Group\n\nAlex Currie, the vice-president of People and Talent said: \"All employees\nacross GoCo Group \u2013 including those at GoCompare, based in Newport \u2013 are\nworking from home. We have enacted our business continuity plan to ensure that\nour people can continue to work productively and safely, without any impact on\nthe services we provide that are used by millions of people across the UK.\n\n\"Each member of staff has a laptop and access to any other hardware of home\noffice equipment they need to be able to work effectively and comfortably away\nfrom the office. We also make sure that people have an opportunity to keep in\ntouch, including through Slack, email, and video conferencing. For example, we\nrecently held an all-company business update which saw just under 200 people\ntake part in a video conference. We were nervous about this as we\u2019d never done\nit before, but it went better than we could have hoped, which is testament to\nthe hard work of our tech team in ensuring everyone was properly set up to\nwork from home.\n\n\u201cWe also run a Friday quiz \u2013 again over video conference \u2013 and have paid for\nall our employees to access health and well-being support aimed at working\nfrom home, such as LinkedIn Learning and resources for parents now finding\nthemselves needing to juggle work with the role of being a teacher and\nchildminder all at the same time.\u201d\n\nGo Compare has stated that as every employee is able to work from home, all\npay and benefits have continued as normal. The company is even continuing with\nits current recruitment plans.\n\nWalesOnline\n\nFollow @WalesOnline\n\nComments\n\nShow more comments\n\nMore On\n\n  * [Coronavirus](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus)\n  * [Employment](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/employment)\n\n  * News\n  * all\n\n  * Most Read\n  * Most Recent\n\n[![](/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-\nnews/a470-police-cardiff-lockdown-\ncoronavirus-18059768)[Coronavirus](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-\nabout/coronavirus)[Police enforce roadblock on A470 to check drivers heading\nto Cardiff](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/a470-police-cardiff-\nlockdown-coronavirus-18059768)[A UK-wide lockdown is in place due to the\ncoronavirus pandemic](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-\nnews/a470-police-cardiff-lockdown-coronavirus-18059768)\n\n[![](/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-\nnews/georgina-coombs-cwmbran-inquest-crash-18060177)[Mum-of-two killed in\nhead-on crash driving wrong way down M4 after leaving\nparty](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/georgina-coombs-cwmbran-\ninquest-crash-18060177)\n\n[Courts](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/courts)[Georgina Coombs, who\nwas 38 and from Cwmbran, was more than twice the drink-drive limit at the time\nof the fatal crash.

One of Flemings\u2019 teachers was already\ninside.\n\n[![](https://i2.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/icn-\npartner-usa_today.png?fit=200%2C67&ssl=1)](http://www.usatoday.com/) This\nstory also appeared in [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/)\n\nThe two got to work preparing for the day, putting away toys and doing a\nsafety check of the rooms, making sure any broken toys were removed, all plugs\nhad safety covers, the first aid kit was filled and no \u201cvisiting critters\u201d had\nentered through floor vents during the night.\n\nBy 6:30 a.m., several children were already grabbing the puzzles and toy cars\noff the shelves and scattering them around the lilac-covered rooms. A few\ncried as their parents and grandparents left. Then came the inevitable sound\nof a tantrum.\n\nA preschooler threw himself on the ground and kicked a bookshelf. Flemings got\ndown next to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI want to play!\u201d the boy whined, pointing at another child holding a toy car.\nHe kicked the bookshelf a few more times.\n\n\u201cWait, look at me,\u201d Flemings said. The boy hesitated and then complied.\n\n\u201cWhen you get angry, we don\u2019t sit on the floor and kick,\u201d Flemings said in a\ncalm voice. \u201cWhen he\u2019s finished, you can have it. Wait your turn.\u201d\n\nFlemings helped the boy up. He eyed the other child, watching closely for a\nchance to take over if the toy was abandoned.\n\nTantrums are commonplace in all daycare centers, but here at Katie\u2019s Place\ndaycare, they are part of the regular rhythm of each day. After a 16-year\ncareer as a special education teacher in a nearby school district, Flemings,\n38, opened the daycare to serve children with disabilities, behavior issues\nand, more generally, families in need.\n\n##  Read more\n\n[ ![](https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Liz-\nWillen-MongeauCoronoaFragile7-new-\nscaled.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1)](https://hechingerreport.org/our-fragile-\nchild-care-system-may-be-about-to-shatter/)\n\n### [Our fragile child care \u2018system\u2019 may be about to\nshatter](https://hechingerreport.org/our-fragile-child-care-system-may-be-\nabout-to-shatter/)\n\nHer own 3-year-old, Katie, the center\u2019s namesake, has autism, and Flemings was\nfrustrated at how she\u2019d been treated in child care centers. In her second\ncareer, she hoped to make a living doing what she cared about most: creating a\nwarm, caring place for kids from difficult and traumatic backgrounds.\n\n> Centers are \u201cpractically giving away child care\u201d by enrolling children with\n> subsidies.\n>\n> Shemonica Flemings\n\nShe took out $60,000 from her retirement savings, a $10,000 loan and $18,000\nfrom an investment account to open Katie\u2019s Place and pay her own bills while\ngetting the business off the ground. She opened her doors in July 2018 with\nfive children enrolled. Within a few months, 31 children attended her center\nfull time. Many dealt with food insecurity and trauma at home. All but two\nchildren received child care subsidies through the state of Texas, which\nreimburses Flemings about $36 per day for each infant \u2014 less than $5 an hour\nfor children who stay a full day.\n\nAfter her first month in operation, Flemings realized she wasn\u2019t bringing in\nenough money through these state-funded subsidies to make payroll. She cried\nthe day she had to take out a loan to pay her three employees, who made just\n$8.50 to $10 an hour. Her biweekly payroll was about $5,900.\n\nFlemings\u2019 situation is far too common in the world of child care, where\nbusinesses, most of them run by women, often struggle to survive. This is\nespecially true for centers that accept children from low-income families who\npay through state subsidies funded by the federal Child Care and Development\nBlock Grant (CCDBG) program, one of the main sources of public funding for\nchild care. Now, child care centers nationwide are in danger of closing\nindefinitely as the coronavirus has forced families to keep kids at home,\ncausing attendance rates at licensed child care centers to plummet by more\nthan 70 percent nationwide in just one week in mid-March. While some centers\ncan rely on parents to keep paying even while keeping their kids at home,\nothers, especially those that serve families who have lost work or are\nreimbursed by their state based on attendance, are now forced to lay off low-\npaid child care workers and close their doors.\n\n**Related:**[ **What is it like to run a child care center in one of America\u2019s\npoorest states?**](https://hechingerreport.org/like-run-child-care-center-one-\namericas-poorest-states/)\n\n![child care providers](https://i2.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/12/maderChildCareproviders4.jpg?w=960&ssl=1)Shemonica\nFlemings, owner of Katie\u2019s Place daycare, talks with a neighbor who donated\nseveral old telephones for the children to play with. Flemings credits the\ngenerosity of community members with providing food and items for her center\nthat she otherwise would not be able to afford. Credit: Jackie Mader/The\nHechinger Report\n\nMany of the child care centers that are already struggling \u2014 like Katie\u2019s\nPlace \u2014 rely on state funding that is tied to attendance. Although the amount\nstates reimburse centers varies, these reimbursements are often far below the\ncosts actually incurred by child care providers to care for children each day:\nEven before the coronavirus, child care centers nationwide were running at a\ndeficit. [Only four states](https://nwlc.org/resources/shortchanging-our-\nyoungest-children-state-payment-rates-for-infant-care/) pay adequate rates for\ninfant care at child care centers, according to a 2018 report from the\nNational Women\u2019s Law Center. The federal government suggests states pay child\ncare providers less than market rate, at the 75th percentile. In Texas, a 2018\nmarket rate survey determined the 75th percentile for full-day infant care at\na licensed center to be [$49 a day](https://txicfw.socialwork.utexas.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/10/2018-Market-Rate-Final-Report_11.26.18.pdf).\n\nIf families can\u2019t make up the difference, child care directors either run\ntheir centers on a shoestring or accept a loss.\n\nEight months in, Flemings was trying to bring in enough money to pay six\nemployees, three of them \u2014 including herself \u2014 full time. Her most experienced\nteacher made $11 an hour and took home about $880 every two weeks. And then\nthere were supplies, repairs, utilities and food for the children. Most kids\nspent the entire day with Flemings, which meant she had to buy enough food to\nserve three meals and three snacks a day to more than a dozen kids. Flemings\nalso set out a bucket of snacks in the evenings so kids had food to take home.\n\nBecause nearly all her families paid using subsidies, raising tuition was\nfutile. Instead, Flemings depended on the kindness of neighbors, the help of\nparents, and strangers in Facebook groups, who offered goods and services for\nfree.\n\n> \u201cThe system is actually being subsidized on the back of the child care\n> providers.\u201d\n>\n> Bethany Edwards, University of California, Berkeley\n\nFour months after opening the center, Flemings, her toddler and her husband,\nwho works as a supervisor for a company that helps inmates transition out of\nprison, moved out of their apartment and in with his elderly mother to save\nmoney. It was the first time Flemings lived under someone else\u2019s roof since\nshe left for college at age 18.\n\nExperts say the way the U.S. funds child care creates a cycle of poverty for\ndaycare workers. \u201cThe system is actually being subsidized on the back of the\nchild care providers,\u201d said Bethany Edwards, a research and policy associate\nat the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley.\n\nFlemings sees it the same way. By enrolling children with subsidies, centers\nare \u201cpractically giving away child care,\u201d she said.\n\nFlemings never imagined she would be a child care center director. Not when\nshe left the small town of Cameron, Texas, located about 73 miles northeast of\nAustin, to get her bachelor\u2019s degree in interdisciplinary studies at Prairie\nView A&M University. Or when she graduated from Texas A&M with a master\u2019s\ndegree in educational psychology. Or when she enrolled at Lamar University,\nwhere she earned her second master\u2019s degree, this time in teacher leadership.\n\nShe loved her job in the school system. Flemings had dreamed about being a\nteacher since kindergarten. She and her family were also secure. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\nrich by any means,\u201d Flemings said. \u201cBut we definitely weren\u2019t worried about\nanything.\u201d In those days, they had their own apartment, money to \u201cdo things\nand enjoy life,\u201d and could afford to take small trips. They had more free\ntime. Flemings had benefits and paid sick days.\n\nBut Flemings was also constantly uneasy about her daughter\u2019s child care\nsituation. Katie, a playful 3-year-old with an impish smile, is largely non-\nverbal. By age 2, Katie had been kicked out of four daycares. While attending\none center, Katie began to show new, disturbing behavior, which included\nsmacking herself. Flemings immediately suspected her daughter was being\nspanked and was trying to communicate that.\n\n## Get important education news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\n**\n\nChoose as many newsletters as you like\n\n** Weekly Update Future of Learning Higher Education Mississippi Learning\nProof Points Early Childhood\n\nSubmitting...\n\nThank you, your sign-up request was successful!

The\n$10,000 included tables and chairs, a microwave, couch, desktop computer and a\nlarge box of toys. She used the rest of her retirement money to pay for other\nnecessities, including colorful, soft gym mats for a small play room, a\nwashing machine and dryer, a new microwave and repairs to a fence around the\nplayground in the backyard. The fire safety system that she thought was active\nwhen she purchased the center turned out to be disconnected, and she had to\nshell out $5,000 to get it repaired and connected to the local fire\ndepartment.\n\nAfter those expenses, she still owed rent for the seven-room building, $1,400\neach month.\n\n**Related:**[ **Can start-up companies profit off one of the lowest paid\nprofessions: Home-based child care?**](https://hechingerreport.org/could-\nsilicon-valley-style-start-ups-save-home-based-child-care/)\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mader-\nchild-care-2.jpg?w=960&ssl=1)Katie\u2019s Place daycare sits in a neighborhood off\na busy highway just north of Austin, Texas. Credit: Jackie Mader/The Hechinger\nReport\n\nFlemings painted the rooms and hung her college and graduate school diplomas\non the walls of her office. She brought Katie\u2019s old baby toys from home for\nthe infant room. She covered old bookshelves with contact paper so children\nwouldn\u2019t get splinters. She advertised her services with signs around the\nneighborhood and, for a brief period of time, on the local radio station.\n\nShe found her employees by posting jobs on Facebook and Indeed. Several had\ncollege degrees, but, at first, the most Flemings could pay them to watch\nmultiple children, nearly all of whom had disabilities or behavioral\nchallenges, was $10 an hour.\n\nOne of Flemings\u2019 employees lived at home with her parents. Another lived on\ngovernment assistance. Flemings\u2019 sister, who worked at her center, had been on\na waiting list for child care assistance for nearly a year. Her paycheck from\nKatie\u2019s Place wasn\u2019t nearly enough to cover child care for her own child, so\nher 15-month-old came to the center every day. At first, Flemings allowed the\ntoddler to come for free. It was not until midway through the year, when her\nsister eventually made it off the waiting list, that Flemings began receiving\na subsidy for the little boy.\n\nNationwide, the majority of early childhood educators, particularly educators\nof color, earn [less than $15 an\nhour](http://cscce.berkeley.edu/files/2018/06/Early-Childhood-Workforce-\nIndex-2018.pdf). In 2017, the median wage for child care workers in all\nsettings was [$10.72](http://cscce.berkeley.edu/files/2018/06/Early-Childhood-\nWorkforce-Index-2018.pdf), compared to $26.88 for preschool teachers in\nschools and $31.29 for kindergarten teachers.\n\nAlthough educational attainment plays a role in these wages, compensation\nstill varies greatly for educators with comparable education based on where\nthey work, according to a [report by the Study of Child Care Employment at the\nUniversity of California,\nBerkeley](http://cscce.berkeley.edu/files/2018/06/Early-Childhood-Workforce-\nIndex-2018.pdf). Teachers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher earn more if they\nwork in a school-based public pre-K, for example, than if they work in a\nfederally-funded Head Start center. Teachers with no degree also earn more in\nschool-sponsored public pre-K than in community-based centers.\n\nEven with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, wages for early childhood teachers are\nextremely low. The mean annual salary for an early childhood educator with a\ndegree working with children from birth to age 3 is only $27,248. Employees at\nchild care centers and daycares also rarely get benefits like paid time off,\npaid time to plan for the next day, retirement accounts, or sick time.\n\n\u201cThese are things we would consider a right and a default for teachers in the\nK-12 system,\u201d said Bethany Edwards, the research associate at the University\nof California. \u201cThey are not being talked about.\u201d\n\nThe plight of child care workers nationwide is especially troubling\nconsidering the importance of the industry and the impact it has on the rest\nof the economy. The child care sector contributes $41.5 billion to the\nnational economy each year and employs 1.57 million workers nationwide, most\nof whom are female, according to a\n[report](https://www.ced.org/pdf/Exec.%20Summary%20-%20Child%20Care%20in%20State%20Economies.pdf)\nby the Committee for Economic Development (CED), a Virginia-based nonpartisan\npublic policy organization. Child care centers allow parents \u2014 and especially\nmothers \u2014 to work. In the U.S., [65 percent of mothers of young\nchildren](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf) are in the labor\nforce; the labor force participation rate for all mothers with children 18 and\nunder is close to 72 percent.\n\n> In 2017, the median wage for child care workers in all settings was $10.72.\n\nEdwards said the low pay is due to an inherent flaw in the child care system:\nEarly childhood education is \u201creally just not valued in our economy.\u201d Even if\na provider has a degree, centers can\u2019t charge parents more because parents\noften can\u2019t afford to pay more, she said.\n\nAt Katie\u2019s Place, this reality is evident every day. The hours are long and\nthe teachers\u2019 jobs go beyond even the hard work of educating and caring for\ntheir young charges. \u201cAll of my teachers are also the custodians and cooks,\nand it\u2019s like, everyone has to rotate and help each other out,\u201d Flemings said.\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/12/MaderChildCare3.jpg?w=960&ssl=1)Shemonica Flemings\ncarries snacks outside during a Valentine\u2019s Day celebration at her child care\ncenter. Credit: Jackie Mader/The Hechinger Report.\n\nThese extra demands have made it even more difficult to recruit and retain\nqualified teachers, who can make twice as much as a private nanny or earn a\nsalary and benefits as a teacher in the public school system. Flemings knew\nshe could rely on a few of her staff members to come in every day, but with\nothers, it was more of a guessing game. She put aside her work as a director\nto take over classes herself when teachers were absent, and she was quick to\njump in and help if a baby needed rocking, a toddler needed a diaper change,\nor children were arguing.\n\n\u201cA person who has enough education and experience is not going to take the\nposition because I can\u2019t pay them enough and I can\u2019t offer them any benefits,\u201d\nFlemings said. \u201cYou take someone who is completely unfamiliar with the\nsituation and you hope and pray they learn fast and you hope and pray from day\nto day they\u2019re going to show up.\u201d\n\nFive months after launching her business, Flemings was doing everything she\ncould to hold the center together with the help of her two full-time\nemployees. She woke up as early as 3:30 or 4 in the morning, sometimes getting\nto the center by 5:00 am. Often, she didn\u2019t leave until after 7:00 p.m. After\nKatie went to sleep, she would spend her evenings on paperwork and lesson\nplans she hadn\u2019t completed during the day.\n\nFlemings\u2019 weekdays blurred into her weekends, when she did repairs at the\ncenter, planned lessons for her teachers, swapped out toys, and cleaned. Her\nhusband came along to help so they could spend some time with each other. Some\nweekends, she provided respite care for a 9-year-old with autism who came to\nthe center after school.\n\nShe was finally able to pay herself after the first of the year, a measly $500\nfor the month of January. The check was far lower than her previous salary as\na teacher and a woeful amount considering the 60 plus hours she put in at her\ncenter each week.\n\nBut Flemings was no longer fearful Katie was being mistreated. Katie split her\ntime between a special education preschool program at the public school near\nher home and at her mother\u2019s daycare. \u201cI was missing a huge chunk of her day,\u201d\nFlemings said. \u201cAnd for that, just to be with her, I think the tradeoff is\nworth it. Because I\u2019m here with my child every day.\u201d\n\n**Related:**[ **Regulations for child care hard to roll back, as Trump\nproposed, because there aren\u2019t\nmany**](https://hechingerreport.org/regulations-for-child-care-hard-to-roll-\nback-as-trump-proposed-because-there-arent-many/)\n\nOn a sunny February morning, Fleming watched the infant area in the back of\nthe center, which is separated from the kitchen by a high wooden gate. Two\nteachers were playing with four babies on a big, blue, alphabet-themed rug.\nObserving her teachers is something Flemings tries to do every day. That\nmorning, she was hopeful that with a full staff present, she would be able to\nmake her rounds, have some time to catch up on paperwork in her office and\nhopefully file paperwork to receive reimbursements for food through a federal\nprogram for daycare centers.\n\n> After six months in operation, Shemonica Flemings paid herself for the first\n> time: $500 for the month of January.\n\nSatisfied with what she saw in the infant class, Flemings walked to her small\noffice, which sits in between the classroom for the older children and the\nhallway leading to the bathroom and the play room. Before she sat down, she\npoked her head out to check on a group of children waiting in line for the\nbathroom. A toddler wandered over to Flemings in stockinged feet. \u201cWhere are\nyour shoes?\u201d she asked. The toddler located his shoes and Flemings sat him on\nthe couch in her office and slipped them back on.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport-newspack-2.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/hechinger-icon-transparent.png?w=42&ssl=1)\n\n**Get important education news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox**\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\n**\n\nChoose as many newsletters as you like\n\n** Weekly Update Future of Learning Higher Education Mississippi Learning\nProof Points Early Childhood\n\nSubmitting\u2026\n\nThank you, your sign-up request was successful!

Credit: Jackie Mader/ The Hechinger\nReport\n\n\u201cI gotcha!\u201d She said grabbing him and wiping his nose as he pushed away from\nher, protesting loudly.\n\nTen minutes later, Flemings still hadn\u2019t sat down at her desk to start the\nfood reimbursement process. A toddler needed a diaper change and his teachers\nwere busy taking other children to the bathroom. A child had run into the door\nframe and needed an ice pack. A little girl wandered into her office and asked\nfor a tissue.\n\n\u201cYou look sad!\u201d Flemings said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nThe little girl whispered that she missed her mom.\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019d feel better if you played?\u201d Flemings asked. The girl shook\nher head no.\n\n\u201cDo you want to help me make a snack?\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\nFlemings led her around the corner to the kitchen where the little girl\nclimbed up on a stool by the sink and they washed their hands together. She\nhanded the girl some napkins to set out on a table by the kitchen. Flemings\nwalked around the table, neatly placing a handful of pretzels for each child\nin the middle of each napkin. A few feet away, a group of rambunctious\npreschool students ran across the center\u2019s entryway and into the front\nclassroom, where a few started climbing on bookshelves while others grabbed\ntoys off the shelves.\n\nThe classrooms at Flemings\u2019 center run on tight schedules. Children have\nbreakfast, indoor play time, outdoor play time, a snack, and circle time,\nfollowed by lessons in math, literacy, and depending on the day, science or\nsocial studies. Children participate in art projects and movement is infused\nin lessons to help kids burn energy. With her education background, Flemings\nhopes to provide a high-quality learning environment, and diligently plans\nlessons every day for each age group at her center.\n\nExperts say a high-quality learning environment is critical during these first\nfew years of a child\u2019s life, when the majority of brain development occurs.\nInfants\u2019 growth can be permanently affected by the environments and\nrelationships they experience. \u201cThere is no doubt in the research that the\nfinancial instability and insecurity of the providers affects their\ninteraction with children,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThe quality of education is\ncompletely dependent on those teacher-child interactions.\u201d\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/12/MaderChildCare6-2.jpg?w=960&ssl=1)Lesson plans hang in\nthe toddler room at Katie\u2019s Place. Owner Shemonica Flemings is unable to\nafford a full curriculum so she and her teachers spend hours cobbling lesson\nplans together from available resources. Credit: Jackie Mader/The Hechinger\nReport\n\nEfforts to provide quality can be hampered by funding. Flemings wanted to buy\na complete, high-quality curriculum to help her teachers structure lessons,\nbut couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nDaycare centers and advocates are still waiting to see how states [will handle\na 2018 funding boost](https://www.ffyf.org/see-just-much-congress-increased-\nfunding-early-childhood-education/) to the CCDBG program and whether that\nmoney will trickle down to centers in the form of higher reimbursement rates\nthat might ease the financial burden for daycare workers. After receiving a\n$230 million increase in federal funds, Texas increased its base payment rates\nby 2 percent as of August 2018, the month Flemings opened her center. The\nstate also planned to use the additional federal funds to serve an estimated\n[28,000 children](https://childcareworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ccdbg-\ntexas.pdf) who are on the waiting list for subsidies and increase payment\nrates for providers who participate in the state\u2019s quality rating system,\nTexas Rising Star, which provides guidelines for boosting and maintaining\nquality in early childhood settings.\n\nFlemings spent months trying to finish paperwork so her center could take part\nin the ratings system. Her center received a rating of 2 on the 4-star scale;\nafter looking at the requirements for a 4-star center, Flemings was confident\nshe could soon achieve it. The additional money from the program, which would\ntrack and measure aspects of quality in her center, wouldn\u2019t be much, maybe\njust a few dollars a day. But it might allow her to hire more staff members,\nwhich would allow her to focus more on the business and less on filling in as\na teacher on the many days when staff members are absent, or suddenly quit.\n\nIn mid-March, Flemings was still holding on in the midst of a rough patch. A\nleaky bathroom had led to expensive repairs which meant she hadn\u2019t paid\nherself for that month yet. Katie spent several days home sick, and Flemings\nhad to miss a day of work to take care of her.\n\nOne Wednesday, Flemings was at the center early to do as much as possible\nbefore leaving for the day to take Katie to a doctor\u2019s appointment. She helped\nset up the front classroom for the toddlers and preschoolers and got a few\nchildren situated at a long plastic table to eat their breakfast of toaster\nwaffles cut up into bite-size pieces and pineapple.\n\nOne child who was still playing in the front room clapped thick wooden puzzle\npieces together, the sound getting louder and louder until Flemings couldn\u2019t\nignore it anymore.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make music, use a tambourine,\u201d she said gently but firmly,\ninstructing the child to go put the puzzle pieces away. He took a few steps\nback and clapped the pieces together louder.\n\n\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Flemings said gently but firmly. \u201cPut the puzzle back\ntogether.\u201d Before the boy could follow her directions, Katie picked up two\npuzzle pieces and began to clap them together, watching her mom with a sly\nsmile on her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being trolled by a toddler,\u201d Flemings said exasperated, laughing as she\ngot up to take the puzzle pieces away.\n\nA moment later, she returned to her morning project: sorting through a large,\nwhite cardboard box full of curriculum materials. The box had been given to\nher by a state official who found it sitting untouched in the closet of\nanother daycare center. When Flemings first opened the box, she realized that\ndozens of materials were missing, so each day she tried to cobble together a\ncurriculum as best she could, spending time sorting through plastic sheets\nexplaining daily lessons and small activity cards meant to supplement those\nlessons. A parent at the center who teaches fifth grade helped Flemings sort\nand group activities together on a color-coded spreadsheet that Flemings\nconsulted frequently as she planned instruction.\n\nAs children finished breakfast and returned to playing, a teacher opened the\nblinds to let in some light. The sky had turned from black to dark gray. Over\nthe next hour, three more children were dropped off. A mother carried her\nsleeping child into the center and carefully set her down, still fast asleep,\nin a chair at the table next to the kitchen. Another handed her baby off to\nthe infant teacher.\n\nA father came in soon after. \u201cHe says his stomach hurts,\u201d he said, motioning\nto his son. \u201cCall me if he throws up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Flemings said. \u201cHave a good day!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou too,\u201d the dad said as he leaned down and hugged his son, who was wrapped\nin a colorful, fuzzy blanket.\n\n![child care providers](https://i1.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/12/maderchildcare7.jpg?w=960&ssl=1)A child plays on the\nground at Katie\u2019s Place daycare. The center lost more than a dozen students\nafter local elementary schools opened free public pre-K programs. Credit:\nJackie Mader/ The Hechinger Report\n\nFlemings guided the boy over to the table where he sat down for a late\nbreakfast. He looked at the little girl, still half asleep with her head on\nthe table. \u201cAre you sick like me?\u201d he asked.\n\nLater that day, Flemings gazed around at her center as children napped. \u201cI\nlike being here. I love being with the kids,\u201d Flemings said. \u201cI still have the\nhope this will work out and turn into something really nice.\u201d\n\nDespite their own challenges, the parents at Katie\u2019s Place rallied around\nFlemings and her center. They often brought in bags of beans and loaves of\nbread to help reduce her food costs. They helped with repairs, which, when\nunexpected and costly enough, meant the difference between Flemings paying\nherself that month or going without. \u201cThey\u2019re helping any way they can,\u201d\nFlemings said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have money and we need money.\u201d\n\nHer neighborhood also rallied around her. Her next door neighbor donated a\nstove to the center and regularly mowed the lawn. Another neighbor donated\ntires so Flemings could build an obstacle course in the center\u2019s yard for\nchildren to work on their motor skills and burn off some energy. When a\ncommunity member noticed the daycare was trying to create gardens in the front\nyard, she brought seeds so the children could grow plants. The owner of a\nnearby daycare center took Flemings under her wing, offering advice as\nFlemings attempted to increase her business.\n\nFlemings felt she was constantly waiting: for more children to enroll, for\nmore time to finish paperwork, for more money to pay her staff \u201cclose to a\nliving wage.\u201d She waited to have the finances to build a bigger playground in\nthe backyard and to buy a complete curriculum and some resources to help the\nchildren with more severe disabilities.\n\nAt the start of her second year, Flemings had to make some tough decisions.\nShe shut down her infant room after realizing she was losing money. Babies\ncost more to care for than the state would reimburse. Just as she started to\nfeel comfortable financially, a few local schools opened full-day pre-K\nclassrooms, and Flemings lost several of her older kids to those programs.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t blame parents for their decision. \u201cIf you can get it for free,\nright? You get a public school with a certified teacher. Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nEach day, she still felt a roller coaster of emotions. On her worst days, she\nfelt trapped.\n\nBut she wouldn\u2019t go back to her job as a teacher, even if it gave her more\nsecurity, more time, and more money. Instead, she focused on making\nimprovements one step at a time. She spent time redesigning her website,\nadding the tagline \u201cA Hidden Gem\u201d to the center\u2019s logo.\n\nAs she trudged forward, she tried to pull together a better semblance of a\nwork-life balance. She stopped coming to the center every weekend to do work.\nShe started making more time to take her daughter to the park or to swim\nclasses. She still dreamed of finding the \u201csweet spot\u201d where she could hire a\ndirector, someone to help her manage the center. She wanted to become\nnationally certified and get to the point where she could afford field trips\nfor the students. She wanted to have enough in her bank account so she, her\nhusband and her daughter could move into their own house. But Katie\u2019s Place\nwas still surviving on the financial edge.\n\nEvery time she got close to a breaking point, her families came to the rescue.\nIn addition to extra food, families brought in bleach, towels, spray bottles\nand dishwashing liquid when they could afford it. Flemings returned the favor\nwhen she could, donating any food left over at the end of each week to\nfamilies in need.\n\nBut, as confirmed cases of COVID-19 began to spread across central Texas in\nmid-March, Flemings\u2019 enrollment started to drop.\n\nBy late March, just seven of her 22 kids were left. When Flemings went to\ngrocery stores to buy food for those children, she found herself subject to\nthe same purchase limits as individuals and was unable to buy enough. Still,\ndespite the uncertainty, she remains committed to being there for the parents\nwho need her. \u201cIt is definitely a scary time for us,\u201d Flemings said. \u201cWe are\ngoing to stay open for as long as possible.\u201d\n\n_This story about[ child care providers](https://hechingerreport.org/her-\ndaycare-was-already-on-the-brink-then-coronavirus-struck/) was produced by\n_[_The Hechinger Report_](http://hechingerreport.org/) _, a nonprofit,\nindependent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in\neducation.

Player salaries came from the team pages of\n[Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/).\n\n    *  **Formula:** (2019 WAR x 8) - 2019 salary = net value\n\nAfter that, the cumulative net values of all players who were part of the MLB\npayroll at any point in 2019 were totaled to determine each team's total net\nvalue.\n\nIncluded is a look at each team's five best and five worst values, along with\na few bullet points for each club that consist of notable observations.\n\nFor those of you looking for a complete picture of your favorite team, a link\nto a full breakdown in the form of a Google Sheets document can be found under\nthe total net value for each team.\n\n# 30\\.

Murphy, a former Rockies top prospect, was acquired in a trade with the Giants just days after San Francisco claimed him off waivers at the end of March.\n    * Outfielder Mitch Haniger played in just 63 games during an injury-plagued season, yet he was still the team's fifth-best value. The 28-year-old is projected to earn [$3 million](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/10/mlb-arbitration-salaries-2020.html) in his first year of arbitration, and with a healthy season, he could again provide tremendous value.\n    * Longtime ace Felix Hernandez wrapped up a seven-year, $175 million deal in 2019 with a 6.40 ERA in 71.2 innings spanning 15 starts.

That opened the door for 29 year-old Jacob Stallings (+$10.7M) to see more playing time, and the position could be his if no outside addition is made.\n    * Center fielder Starling Marte (+$12.9M) will be a hot commodity on the trade market if the Pirates decide to make him available.

He earned $12 million and posted [3.1 WAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/machama01.shtml) in the first year of his 10-year, $300 million contract.\n    * In the second season of an eight-year, $144 million contract, Eric Hosmer posted a [93 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hosmeer01.shtml) with 22 home runs and negative-0.3 WAR. That contract could look worse and worse in the years to come.\n    * Shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. and right-hander Chris Paddack broke through from a stacked farm system in 2019, and more young talent is on the way.

That will take a bite out of his net value, but he still would have been the second-best value on the Angels roster had he earned that in 2019.\n    * If the Angeles want to take a step forward, upgrading the starting rotation is a must. The front office settled for adding Matt Harvey and Trevor Cahill on one-year deals last winter, and they wound up being the two worst values on the roster among pitchers.\n    * Closer Hansel Robles finished as the fifth-best value among all relievers.

On the flip side, Jake Arrieta was the sixth-worst value among all starting pitchers.\n    * Utility infielder Brad Miller (+$8.5M) deserves a mention as one of the biggest surprises in 2019. After catching on with the Phillies in June, he posted a [135 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/millebr02.shtml) with 12 home runs in 130 plate appearances and 1.1 WAR, all while earning just $322,272.\n\n# 20\\.

He could be a candidate for an early team-friendly extension or a valuable chip on the trade market.\n    * First baseman Chris Davis was the third-worst value in baseball, behind only Felix Hernandez (-$32.7M) and Miguel Cabrera (-$30M). He still has three years and $63.4 million remaining on his ill-advised seven-year, $161 million deal, and has produced an [82 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisch02.shtml) and negative-0.4 WAR.\n\n# 19\\.

He slugged a career-high 31 home runs in 2019 but hit just .232/.280/.457 for a [93 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/grichra01.shtml) in the process.\n    * The Blue Jays had the most dead money on the 2019 payroll of any team, shelling out $50.4 million to players no longer on the roster.

With a healthy season, he's still capable of providing significant value.\n    * With a normal preseason of preparation, Craig Kimbrel will look to bounce back from a disappointing 2019 season. He signed a three-year, $43 million deal on June 7 and was shelled to the tune of a 6.53 ERA in 23 appearances.\n    * Yu Darvish (+$4M) and Cole Hamels (+$3.2M) both provided positive value despite $20 million salaries.

He was lights-out in a setup role with a 2.92 ERA, seven saves and 21 holds in 73 appearances while also going 10-for-48 with two doubles and one home run to log [0.4 WAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lorenmi01.shtml) as an outfielder and pinch hitter.\n    * Outfielder Aristides Aquino (+$11M) was not called up until Aug. 1, hitting 19 home runs in 56 games to rank among the most valuable rookies in baseball.

The former top prospect posted a 3.41 ERA and 1.06 WHIP with 228 strikeouts in 176.2 innings, tossing three complete games and two shutouts along the way.\n    * Lefty Aaron Bummer was the third-best value among all relief pitchers, trailing only Oakland's Liam Hendriks (+$25.9M) and Boston's Brandon Workman (+$24.5M).\n    * The White Sox added Yonder Alonso and Jon Jay in part to help with their recruiting pitch to Manny Machado.

The 27-year-old earned $20.1 million this past year and is projected for a hefty raise to [$27.7 million](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/10/mlb-arbitration-salaries-2020.html) in his final year of arbitration. With the team focused on getting under the luxury tax threshold and Betts one year removed from free agency, a blockbuster trade could be forthcoming.\n    * Despite another strong season at the plate, designated hitter J.D. Martinez (+$2.7M) produced minimal positive value on his $23.8 million salary. If he decides to opt-out of the final three years and $60 million of his current contract, it will be interesting to see how much higher teams are willing to spend for his services.\n\n# 14\\.

He's owed just $41.5 million over the next three years.\n    * Rookie second baseman Keston Hiura (+$16.5M) should be a strong contender for the No. 1 best value spot next year with a full season at the MLB level. The 23-year-old hit .303/.368/.570 for a [138 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hiurake01.shtml) with 23 doubles and 19 home runs in 84 games.\n    * Disappointing seasons from Corbin Burnes, Jimmy Nelson, Jeremy Jeffress (-$6.4M) and Corey Knebel (-$5.1) dealt a significant blow to the pitching staff. Filling out the rotation behind All-Star Brandon Woodruff needs to be a priority this offseason.\n\n# 13\\.

He's owed $29.5 million in 2020, and he has played in just 119 games and posted [3.1 WAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cespeyo01.shtml) over the first three years and $80.5 million of his contract.\n    * Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil, Michael Conforto, Amed Rosario (+$13.8M) and J.D.

The 28-year-old posted a 2.31 ERA, 0.81 WHIP and 11.3 K/9 in 66 appearances, earning a spot among the team's best values in the process.\n\n# 10\\.

He succeeded despite a lack of swing-and-miss stuff, posting a middling 7.3 K/9 in 174.2 innings of work.\n    * Josh Donaldson signed the largest one-year deal in free-agency history for a position player when he inked a $23 million pact with the Braves last offseason. Despite that hefty price tag, he was still one of the best values on the roster, thanks to a [6.1-WAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/donaljo02.shtml) season.\n    * The bullpen was an issue for the Braves for much of the season, and that set up a busy trade deadline that included taking on all the remaining money owed to Mark Melancon.

The last time he took the field in an MLB game was Sept. 30, 2017.\n    * The two-year, $24 million contract given to DJ LeMahieu last winter is a strong contender for best signing of the year. The 31-year-old played all over the infield while propping up an injury-plagued offense for much of the season with a [136 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lemahdj01.shtml) and 61 extra-base hits.\n\n# 7\\.

His base salary in 2019 was $35 million, but the team deferred $30 million of that in the form of three $10 million installments paid out from 2020-22. So for the sake of this exercise, his 2019 salary was only $5 million.\n    * The outfield of Juan Soto, Victor Robles and Adam Eaton (+$4.4M) was one of the most valuable in all of baseball, while infielders Anthony Rendon, Howie Kendrick (+$16.8M) and Trea Turner (+$15.5M) also provided a value boost.\n    * Ryan Zimmerman wrapped up a six-year, $100 million extension in 2019, playing just 52 games and posting an [86 OPS+](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zimmery01.shtml) and negative-0.2 WAR.

Dollar for dollar, he was the best value in baseball in 2019.\n    * The emergence of young, homegrown players like Alex Verdugo, Walker Buehler (+$17M), Will Smith (+$12.6M), Julio Urias (+$11.4M), Tony Gonsolin (+$7.1M) and Gavin Lux (+$2.3M) shows that the Dodgers have been successful for reasons beyond their significant payroll flexibility.\n    * Closer Kenley Jansen banked $19.3 million in 2019 and had arguably the worst season of his career with eight blown saves and a 3.71 ERA.

The mood reflects 2018's wage\ngrowth, according to federal data.\n\nYounger employees - whose careers are still budding - tend to shift gears by\nchanging employers, positions or career tracks more often than their older\ncolleagues do. These shifts sometimes offer better pay for Millennial and Gen\nZ workers.\n\nREAD MORE: [Playing it safe? 10 career moves people\nregret](https://www.hcamag.com/us/news/general/playing-it-safe-10-career-\nmoves-people-regret/176692)\n\n**Differences in job satisfaction**  \nAll in all, however, the percentage of working Americans who were said to be\nsatisfied with their compensation increased slightly from 43% in 2017 to 46.4%\nin 2018.

Associated Press\n\n  * The tech landscape looks completely different today than it did at the beginning of the decade.\n  * Numerous tech companies that didn't even exist before 2010 joined the ranks of the unicorns in 2019, reaching the vaunted benchmark of a $1 billion valuation.\n  * Some of the young companies to reach unicorn status this year include Lyft, Instagram, Casper, Snapchat, and Warby Parker.\n  * [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet)\n\nDuring the decade of the 2010s, future unicorns -- a term used to denote\nstartups worth at least $1 billion -- were born left and right.\n\nA unicorn is not a mythical creature in Silicon Valley. With great help from\nthe tech boom and investors with deep pockets, unicorns are _everywhere_. You\nsee ads for them [in the subway](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/style/sex-\nsubway-ads-new-york.html), [scroll past posts of\ninfluencers](http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/fans-and-micro-micro-\ninfluencers-the-answer-to-growing) touting their products on social media, and\n[you may even sleep on one at\nnight](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/mattress-startup-casper-said-to-be-\nvalued-at-1-1b-with-new-funding/).\n\nThe last decade introduced too many startups to count. Only a few hundred of\nthem, though, ever went on to see a $1 billion valuation.\n\nThe more notable billion-dollar startups born in the 2010s include ride-\nhailing app Lyft, millennial-marketing mastermind Glossier, and WeWork. But if\nyou get your insurance from a sleekly designed app called Lemonade, or order\nyour Sweetgreen salad via Postmates, you'll start to realize there are\nunicorns all around you.\n\nWith that in mind, take a look at 30 companies worth at least $1 billion that\ndidn't exist 10 years ago.\n\n## Paris-based Meero has become the go-to tool for photo editors since its\nlaunch in 2016. The company raised $230 million, pushing its valuation to $1\nbillion this past June.\n\n![Thomas Rebaud, CEO, Meero](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5dd6c065fd9db25eee056303?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nThomas Rebaud, CEO, Meero  Meero\n\nMeero is an online editing and production tool assistant for photographers\nthat uses artificial intelligence, akin to Photoshop -- but much quicker and\nmore streamlined. The tech behind Meero lets AI edit raw images automatically.\nIt also matches freelance photographers with companies looking for content,\nwith a 24-hour turnaround time. Meero [raised $230\nmillion](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/ai-photography-platform-meero-\nraises-230-million-to-become-frances-newest-unicorn/) in June, pushing its\nvaluation to $1 billion to become one of Europe's fastest growing companies of\nthe decade.\n\nMeero CEO Thomas Rebaud wants to host more photographer meet-ups in the\nfuture, host masterclasses, and [maybe even launch a\nmagazine](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/meero-raises-230-million-for-its-\non-demand-photo-platform/).\n\n## Juul Labs launched in 2015 and has grown into a multi-billion-dollar\ncompany, with a valuation of $24 billion. But the company has come under fire\nover the last few years, making its future uncertain.\n\n![Juul](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5c1be56bd4beaf367a4a74b6?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nGetty\n\nOne of the more controversial startups of this decade, Juul, the e-cigarette\ncompany, sparked national outrage, congressional investigations, and criticism\nby the Food and Drug Administration, leading to total product [bans in some\ncountries](https://www.businessinsider.com/juul-e-cigarette-success-fda-\ninvestigation-2019-10).\n\nJuul's rise was fast, thanks in part to its marketing strategy. Advertisements\non social media -- depicting young adults in flashy, bright-colored ads\npromoting e-cigarette flavors like cucumber and mango -- are what some critics\nattribute to the [epidemic of teenage nicotine\nuse](https://www.businessinsider.com/special-report-juul-disregarded-early-\nevidence-it-was-hooking-teens-2019-11). A year after Juul's launch, sales rose\n700%, selling over 1 million products.\n\nBut in September, Juul's CEO stepped down under increasing scrutiny over\nvaping's effect on lung health, despite the company touting its product as the\nsafer alternative to cigarettes. The company also recently [halted advertising\nin the US](https://www.businessinsider.com/juul-timeline-from-startup-to-\ntobacco-company-challenges-bans-2019-9#july-25-2019-officials-in-wisconsin-\nwarn-of-eight-cases-of-severe-lung-disease-in-teens-whod-vaped-its-unclear-\nwhat-kinds-of-products-or-substances-are-involved-32) and its lobbying efforts\nin Washington. Its valuation fell from $38 billion earlier this year.\n\n## DoorDash, the popular food delivery service, is valued at $13 billion.\n\n![Tony Xu DoorDash](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5dd6b78efd9db2583926f484?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nDoorDash CEO Tony Xu  Kimberly White/Getty Images\n\nDoorDash launched in San Francisco in 2013, and has since gained a fair amount\nof competitors like UberEats, Postmates, and Seamless. This past summer, the\ncompany faced backlash for its pay model for delivery workers that sometimes\nmeant workers[ didn't actually receive customers'\ntips](https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-still-be-pocketing-tips-\ndespite-pay-model-change-2019-8).

Some employers are also recognizing the contributions of these\nemployees with better annual incentives and discretionary bonuses.\"  \n\nIn its survey, Mercer found that:  \n\n  * A small portion of employers, 14 percent in 2019, do not use performance ratings.

But\nin Pittsburgh and Cleveland the increases were just 0.8 percent and 0.7\npercent, respectively.  \n  \n\n**Ninth Year in a Row that Salary Growth Has Stayed Consistent**\n\nPay consultancy Korn Ferry also weighed in with a 2020 salary increase\nforecast in mid-September, striking many of the same chords as other 2020 pay\nprojections.\n\nFor the ninth year in a row [U.S. employees can expect to see a 3.0 percent\nmedian base salary increase in 2020](https://www.kornferry.com/press/same-ol-\nsame-ol), based on data from Korn Ferry's U.S. pay database, collected from\nMarch through June 2019.\n\nWhile the 3.0 percent anticipated median growth in base salaries is consistent\nacross employee groups from clerical support to executives, there are\nvariations in pay increase practices across organizations. Companies in the\ntop 10th percentile of surveyed organizations estimate a 3.5 percent increase\nacross employee groups in 2020, while the organizations that pay in the bottom\n10th percentile predict a 2.5 percent increase, according to the firm's\nanalysis.\n\n\"Even though the U.S. economy remains strong and we are experiencing very low\nunemployment levels, there are mixed views on anticipated economic growth,\nwhich has an impact on wage growth,\" said Korn Ferry Senior Client Partner Tom\nMcMullen. \"One factor may be that feelings of uncertainty about the future are\nkeeping employers cautious in terms of offering higher growth in fixed costs\nand base wages,\" he noted.  \n\n\"While the 3.0 percent median salary increase number has become typical over\nthe years, that doesn't mean that top performers aren't being rewarded,\" added\nMcMullen. \"Companies are relying more on short and long-term incentive plans\nand pay-for-performance programs to provide meaningful pay differentiation for\ntop talent.

Butz became the CEO of DKSH Holding Ltd.\n([VTX:DKSH](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/commercial-services/vtx-dksh/dksh-\nholding-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1051809))\nin 2017. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in\ncomparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Then we'll look\nat a snap shot of the business growth. And finally - as a second measure of\nperformance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the\nlast few years. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO\npay levels.\n\n[ Check out our latest analysis for DKSH Holding\n](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/commercial-services/vtx-dksh/dksh-holding-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1051809)\n\n### How Does Stefan Butz's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?\n\nOur data indicates that DKSH Holding Ltd. is worth CHF3.3b, and total annual\nCEO compensation was reported as CHF3.8m for the year to December 2018. While\nthis analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is\nlower, valued at CHF1.0m. We note that more than half of the total\ncompensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this\nnon-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market\ncapitalizations from CHF1.9b to CHF6.2b, and the median CEO total compensation\nwas CHF1.5m.\n\nThus we can conclude that Stefan Butz receives more in total compensation than\nthe median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size to\nDKSH Holding Ltd.. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the pay is too high.\nWe can get a better idea of how generous the pay is by looking at the\nperformance of the underlying business.\n\nYou can see, below, how CEO compensation at DKSH Holding has changed over\ntime.\n\n[![SWX:DKSH CEO Compensation, February 7th\n2020](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![SWX:DKSH CEO Compensation,\nFebruary 7th\n2020](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_Mluyim60cgLUlgal6DQOg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/cf9398c614325f27abb33f07815eeaca)SWX:DKSH\nCEO Compensation, February 7th\n2020More](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/commercial-services/vtx-dksh/dksh-\nholding-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=1051809#ceo_salary)\n\n### Is DKSH Holding Ltd. Growing?\n\nOn average over the last three years, DKSH Holding Ltd. has grown earnings per\nshare (EPS) by 7.7% each year (using a line of best fit). The trailing twelve\nmonths of revenue was pretty much the same as the prior period.\n\nI generally like to see a little revenue growth, but it is good to see EPS\ngrowth. In conclusion we can't form a strong opinion about business\nperformance yet; but it's one worth watching. It could be important to check\n[this free visual depiction of **what analysts expect** for the\nfuture](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/commercial-services/vtx-dksh/dksh-\nholding-shares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-\npitch&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1051809#past).\n\n### Has DKSH Holding Ltd. Been A Good Investment?\n\nWith a three year total loss of 30%, DKSH Holding Ltd. would certainly have\nsome dissatisfied shareholders. It therefore might be upsetting for\nshareholders if the CEO were paid generously.\n\n### In Summary...\n\nWe examined the amount DKSH Holding Ltd. pays its CEO, and compared it to the\namount paid by similar sized companies. As discussed above, we discovered that\nthe company pays more than the median of that group.\n\nThe growth in the business has been uninspiring, but the shareholder returns\nhave arguably been worse, over the last three years. Although we'd stop short\nof calling it inappropriate, we think the CEO compensation is probably more on\nthe generous side of things. CEO compensation is one thing, but it is also\ninteresting to [check if the CEO is buying or selling DKSH Holding (free\nvisualization of insider trades).](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/commercial-\nservices/vtx-dksh/dksh-holding-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1051809#insider_trading)\n\nOf course, **you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.** So\ntake a peek at this **free** [list of interesting companies.\n](https://simplywall.st/user/views/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-\ndebt?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion-\ngrid&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1051809)\n\n_If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor\nat[editorial-team@simplywallst.com](mailto:editorial-\nteam@simplywallst.com?subject=Re%3A%20Your%20article%20on%20SWX%3ADKSH%20\\(yahoo\\)%20from%207th%20February%202020).\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

allocate the largest amount of their payroll budget\nto bonuses in the history of Aon's 43-year study.\n\nStructured bonus programs reached record-high funding levels this year and\n[are projected to do the same](https://rewards.aon.com/en-\nus/insights/articles/2019/aon-2019-2020-us-salary-increase-survey) in 2020,\nsays Ken Abosch, an employee rewards consulting leader at Aon, a global\nconsulting firm.\n\nOn average, he says, companies in 2020 are planning to budget 13.1% of payroll\nfor bonus expenses, up from 12.9% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these bonuses aren\u2019t for everyone, like clerical or hourly\nworkers,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cThis has been a long-standing trend that hasn\u2019t budged\nvery much \u2026 about 25% of hourly workers are covered by these types of\narrangements.\u201d\n\n[Like other incentive plans](https://hrexecutive.com/incentives-in-the-age-of-\nattrition/), bonus programs have evolved over the decades. Among the most\npopular are individual employee-performance plans (23% offer such bonuses,\naccording to a recent Aon survey of roughly 400 mid-to large-size employers)\nand special recognition plans (52% offered spot bonuses in 2019, compared to\n51% in 2017, reports Aon). However, the trend is shifting toward business-\nincentive plans or bonuses based on multiple performance layers, such as\noverall company results, individual performance and business unit outcomes.\nThis year, approximately 85% of organizations surveyed by Aon have adopted\nthis approach, up from 77% in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\n\u201cWhen employees below the executive level started getting bonuses, 80% to 90%\nwere individual-performance plans \u2026 a discretionary award given at the end of\nthe year based on a manager\u2019s judgement,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cManagers weren\u2019t\nreally equipped to make good decisions, so they eliminated those plans, which\nbecame profit-sharing plans that focused more or less on company performance\ninstead of individual performance.\u201d\n\n**Related:[Big blue-collar bonuses](https://hrexecutive.com/signing-bonuses-\nas-incentives/)**\n\nHowever, he says, many companies don\u2019t support spot bonuses, believing they\u2019re\ndifficult to manage, aren\u2019t valued by employees and don\u2019t motivate workers.\nUnfortunately, some employers or managers have watered them down by handing\nthem out to all staff throughout the year. But others have designed a\nselection process and are now realizing their powerful impact. Since spot\nbonuses are awarded shortly after an employee accomplishment, Abosch says,\n\u201cthe psychic income value is greater than the actual monetary value.\u201d\n\nStill, business-incentive plans are by far the most popular because they\nenable companies to accomplish alignment and line of sight. Research has shown\nthe importance of making sure employees are aligned to the company\u2019s\nobjectives and goals and thinking about how to help drive them, he explains.\n\n\u201cMore high-performance organizations have come to the realization that broad-\nbased variable pay is the most effective way to send a strong pay-for-\nperformance message and truly differentiate rewards for high performers versus\nlow performers,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cThis form of compensation has evolved from a\nnice-to-have or thank you at the end of the year to a meaningful weapon in the\narsenal of tools that motivate employees to achieve required business\nresults.\u201d\n\n**Bigger Bonuses, Broader Base**\n\nSmall organizations have more wiggle room when awarding bonuses. Consider St.\nJohn Properties, a real estate company that[ divvied up $10 million among its\n198 employees in\nbonuses](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/10/real-estate-company-\nsurprises-198-employees-10-million-bonus/4384763002/) at its holiday party\nthis year. Based on tenure, the bonuses ranged from $100, given to an employee\nwho hadn\u2019t stared his job yet, to $270,000 for a longtime employee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nAlthough that\u2019s not realistic for large organizations employing thousands of\nworkers, 48% of companies that offer holiday or year-end bonuses plan to\neither increase them or keep them the same, according to a [2019 survey\nconducted by Robert Half](http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-12-03-48-Of-\nCompanies-That-Offer-Year-End-Bonuses-Plan-To-Increase-Them-Survey-Finds.), a\nglobal recruiting firm. Yet, 4% anticipate reducing them. The research found\nthat organizations in Nashville, Austin, Denver and Minneapolis are most\nlikely to increase bonuses.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, companies seem to be investing and engaging in\nthese markets,\u201d says Luke Stratmann, metro market manager at Robert Half. He\nbelieves the bonus increases may be needed to attract more skilled talent to\nthese communities.\n\nAnother trend is enhancing transparency. He says more employees receive\nbonuses out in the open, in front of their peers, where they can be cheered\nand applauded for specific accomplishments.\n\n**See also:[The 6 key elements of employee\nexperience](https://hrexecutive.com/the-6-key-elements-of-employee-\nexperience/)**\n\nIn the future, Stratmann believes bonuses will be handed out \u201call the way from\nthe top to the absolute bottom of an organization if we continue to exist in\nthe current employee climate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, OneDigital has been advising its clients to be more creative\nregarding bonuses, says Stacy Strauser, director of compensation consulting at\nthe employee-benefits and health-consulting firm.\n\nWhile cash remains king, she says, examples of creative bonuses include\ntraining opportunities or enabling employees to work from home for one month.\nAlso consider awarding bonuses to larger groups and for more reasons like\nhelping co-workers complete a task, demonstrating the organization\u2019s values or\nserving as an exceptional team member.\n\n\u201cHave your ducks in a row and document the bonus program in advance, on your\nwebsite,\u201d says Strauser, adding that a website posting could say that employee\nbonuses are based on tenure and the result of the company\u2019s outstanding year.\n\u201cAlways tie bonuses to employee or company performance, and make sure\nemployees know that bonuses are not an entitlement.\u201d\n\nCarol Patton is a contributing editor for _HRE_ who also writes HR articles\nand columns for business and education magazines.

And with the\nunemployment rate still low, that problem is not likely to go away soon.\n\nA few months ago we noted that, according to a survey from Kelton Global,\ncommissioned by [QuickBooks\nPayroll](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/employee-benefits/#report\n\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/employee-benefits/#report\"), employees\nof small businesses expect their [employers to offer a healthy and robust\nbenefits package](https://www.allbusiness.com/employee-benefits-small-\nbusiness-survey-124381-1.html \"https://www.allbusiness.com/employee-benefits-\nsmall-business-survey-124381-1.html\").\n\nBut the survey also showed benefits weren\u2019t enough to keep employees\nsatisfied. Salary counts\u2014a lot. This may seem obvious, but over the past\nseveral years so much attention has been paid to the power of benefits that\nwages haven\u2019t gotten the attention they should have.\n\nToday In: [Entrepreneurs](https://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs)\n\n  * [\n\n### Meet Patricia Bright: Social Media Maven And Founder Of The Break Platform\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommywilliams1/2020/04/08/meet-patricia-bright-\nsocial-media-maven-and-founder-of-the-break-platform/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Bangladesh\u2019s New Generation Of Women-Led Labor Unions Confronts The\nPandemic\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2020/04/07/bangladeshs-new-generation-\nof-women-led-labor-unions-confronts-the-pandemic/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Coffee With A Black Guy: This Social Entrepreneur Is Keeping His Community\nTalking, Despite Social Distancing\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2020/04/07/coffee-with-a-black-\nguy-this-social-entrepreneur-is-keeping-his-community-talking-despite-social-\ndistancing/)\n\n![Businesswoman handing check](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e26668fa854780006cb4efc/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=998&cropY1=73&cropY2=635)\n\nWhat exactly do employees expect when it comes to salary?\n\n\u00a9 Andrey Popov - Adobe Stock\n\nThe solution to finding and retaining employees is to offer a strong salary\nand benefits package\u2014one that\u2019s solid enough to show your staff you value\nthem. As the survey says, \u201cThe right pay and benefits can transform a job into\na lifelong career by building employee loyalty and keeping them motivated to\ncome to work each day.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when that package falls short? According to the report, many\nemployees say they\u2019d likely go in search of a new job\u2014one that offers the\nsalary and benefits they want. So, what exactly do your employees expect when\nit comes to salary? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n## Unhappy workers\n\nMany (44%) small business employees are not satisfied with their pay. It\u2019s\nlikely your staff is among them, and that should worry you. Almost half (49%)\nof those surveyed complain their salaries haven\u2019t kept up with the cost of\nliving. Women in particular feel this way, with 53% saying this versus 44% of\nmen.\n\nIf they haven\u2019t had a pay raise in the past year, employees were even more\nlikely to complain: 61% of those workers complain about not getting pay\nincreases to keep up with cost of living increases. In addition, in many parts\nof the country, 26% of small business employees can't afford to live close to\ntheir work, which increases commuting costs.\n\nNot getting a raise in the past year also diminishes how employees feel about\nyour business overall. In general, 54% of employees who haven\u2019t gotten raises\nin the past year are not satisfied with their individual salaries and their\noverall compensation packages. And this is when the impact of unhappy\nemployees can start affecting your company.\n\nIndeed, 69% of employees who haven\u2019t gotten a raise believe they could be\nearning more money if they had a different job, and 65% think quitting and\nfinding a job at another company would enable them to earn more. Only 55%\nwould ask for a pay raise, meaning valued staff could be out the door before\nyou\u2019re even aware they\u2019re not happy working for you. In fact, among the\nnation\u2019s workers who have looked for a new job in the past year, 43% say they\nstarted their new job search because they knew they \u201ccould make more money\nelsewhere.\u201d\n\nIf you have been giving annual raises, this isn\u2019t the time to cut back. Among\nemployees who\u2019ve gotten raises in the last year, 37% would immediately start\nlooking for a new job, 30% would request a meeting with the boss, and 21%\nwould request a new benefit to compensate if your company stopped offering\nannual pay increases.\n\n## Why salary matters to your employees\n\nSimply put, salary is a great motivator to your employees. Employees surveyed\nadmit they are \u201cmotivated to do their best work each day by the thought of\nmaking more money.\u201d More workers are motivated by this (41%) than by the idea\nof getting benefits (31%). Of course, having a comprehensive benefits package,\nincluding salary increases, is what makes employees feel \u201cmotivated and\nproductive.\u201d\n\nAge matters\u2014a lot. Younger employees at small businesses are more likely than\nolder ones (53% versus 33%) to say making more money at their jobs \u201cmotivates\nthem to do their best work every day.\u201d\n\n**Other Articles From  **[\n**AllBusiness.com**](https://www.allbusiness.com/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=allbusiness%20homepage\n\"https://www.allbusiness.com/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=allbusiness%20homepage\")\n**:**\n\n  * [The Complete 35-Step Guide for Entrepreneurs Starting a Business](https://www.allbusiness.com/starting-a-business-complete-guide-entrepreneurs-117513-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=complete%2035%20step%20guide%20entrepreneurs%20starting%20business \"https://www.allbusiness.com/starting-a-business-complete-guide-entrepreneurs-117513-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=complete%2035%20step%20guide%20entrepreneurs%20starting%20business\")\n  * [25 Frequently Asked Questions on Starting a Business](https://www.allbusiness.com/25-frequently-asked-questions-on-starting-a-business-8225-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=25%20frequently%20asked%20questions%20starting%20business \"https://www.allbusiness.com/25-frequently-asked-questions-on-starting-a-business-8225-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=25%20frequently%20asked%20questions%20starting%20business\")\n  * [50 Questions Angel Investors Will Ask Entrepreneurs](https://www.allbusiness.com/50-questions-angel-investors-will-ask-entrepreneurs-106619-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=50%20questions%20angel%20investors%20will%20ask%20entrepreneurs \"https://www.allbusiness.com/50-questions-angel-investors-will-ask-entrepreneurs-106619-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=50%20questions%20angel%20investors%20will%20ask%20entrepreneurs\")\n  * [17 Key Lessons for Entrepreneurs Starting a Business](https://www.allbusiness.com/17-key-lessons-entrepreneurs-starting-business-109554-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=17%20key%20lessons%20for%20entrepreneurs%20starting%20business \"https://www.allbusiness.com/17-key-lessons-entrepreneurs-starting-business-109554-1.html?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=related%20link&utm_campaign=content%20licensing&utm_content=17%20key%20lessons%20for%20entrepreneurs%20starting%20business\")\n\nThe opportunity to earn more money is not just a motivator for employees, it\nmakes them more loyal as well. Most small business employees say earning a\n\u201ccompetitive\u201d salary (65%) or getting an annual raise (54%) helps build\nloyalty\u2014that\u2019s more than say receiving a comprehensive benefits package builds\nloyalty (52%). Other factors that contribute to cementing company loyalty,\naccording to the survey, are having a positive company culture (58%) and\ngetting deserved promotions (54%).\n\nInterestingly, the survey shows men are more likely than women (69% versus\n61%) to attribute their company loyalty to receiving a competitive salary,\nwhile more women than men (61% versus 55%) say working in a positive company\nculture makes them loyal.\n\n## Attracting new employees\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to hire new workers, the most important factor for accepting\na new job is salary. While there are various factors that get prospective\ncandidates to say yes to a job offer, including a benefits package (41%), a\nflexible work schedule (34%), potential for growth (27%), and adequate amount\nof paid time off (27%), 67% say the offered salary is the key.\n\nWith the unemployment rate so low these days, job seekers aren\u2019t willing to\nsettle for a salary they deem less than adequate, either. In fact, 47% say\nthey would turn down a new job opportunity, no matter how attractive, if the\nsalary offered wasn\u2019t competitive.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about employees leaving for greener pastures, nearly half\n(48%) say they\u2019d stay at their current job after getting a new job offer\u2014 _if_\ntheir current employer matched the new salary.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nIf you want to keep your best workers and attract qualified new staff, you\nneed to create a fair, competitive benefits and pay package. If you don\u2019t,\nyour current staff won\u2019t feel valued and they\u2019ll soon be headed out the door.\n\n_I am  CEO of GrowBiz Media, a media and custom content company focusing on\nsmall business and entrepreneurship.

The customer\nahead of him saw Force desperately rifling through his pockets for some\nchange.\n\n\u201cShe was getting her change back, turned toward me and said, \u2018Here, just keep\nthis. Will that cover it (his bill)?\u2019,\u201d Force told NBCSports.com. \u201cThe lady\nbehind the register said, \u2018Do you know who this is? That\u2019s John Force.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told the lady I really wanted to thank her, the fact she didn\u2019t know who I\nwas, but she\u2019d help anybody. She said, \u2018You looked like you were in trouble,\nand I had that change.\u2019 It was funny to see this woman was going to help me.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the help, but I said, \u2018Thank you very much.\u2019 Then I stood\noutside the door when she walked out. She didn\u2019t want to get close to me\nbecause when you look at me, I\u2019m a little rough anyway. I look like I\u2019m going\nto tip over.\u201d\n\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/211-johnforce-celeb-sunday-\nseattle.jpeg?w=320)John Force celebrates after winning the milestone 150th win\nof his career in Seattle on August 4, 2019. Photo: NHRA.\n\nIn a mostly melancholy 30-minute interview with NBCSports.com Friday, the\nwinner of a record 151 NHRA national events started off as his typical comedic\nself but then grew quite somber because of the seriousness of the novel\ncoronavirus pandemic.\n\nFirst, a bit more humor:\n\nBecause the state mandate is limiting how much he can go to his shop in\nsuburban Los Angeles, Force is trying to keep busy around his house. But for a\nguy who lives, eats, sleeps and breathes drag racing, Force is somewhat\nchallenged when it comes to spending his time wisely.\n\nInstead of planning for his next race, he admits his days are typically spent\nbinge-watching reruns of \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" exercising, cutting his own\ngrass (instead of a lawn service) and turning off unnecessary lights in and\noutside of his house.\n\n\u201cI had so many lights on outside that my house looked like an airport landing\nstrip,\u201d Force said. \u201cThat shows how stupid I am. So I\u2019ve been turning all the\nlights off.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s even hard at work on his waistline \u2013 and getting as little respect as the\nlate Rodney Dangerfield.\n\n\u201cMy wife said, \u2018Now\u2019s a good time to go on a diet, fatty,\u201d Force said.\n\nSo Force is now on Nutrisystem, although he admits he keeps fighting the urge\nto eat eight of the company\u2019s brownies for dinner. And always the hustler,\nForce is thinking about pitching Nutrisystem to become a sponsor of his four-\ncar Funny Car and Top Fuel operation.\n\n* * *\n\nForce, who turns 71 on May 4, then abruptly turns very serious, perhaps more\nso than he ever has.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has a seemingly fearless man who has endured countless\nfires and crashes, [including one that almost killed him in\n2007](https://bit.ly/3bTW0KD), truly scared for his family, his fans, his\nsport and the world as a whole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a motivated kind of guy, but this is probably the toughest\nboat I\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d Force said. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the term \u2018business as\nusual\u2019 anymore. That ain\u2019t a real word. Our No. 1 priority is to keep everyone\nhealthy.\n\n\u201cIt got real serious and now the grim reaper is knocking at our door, and I\u2019ll\nfight that son of a bitch too. \u2026 We\u2019re going to do what we have to do to stay\nwell and healthy.\u201d\n\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/2019_john_force_action.jpg?w=320)A Sunday\ndrive for Force typically goes about 330-plus mph in less than four seconds.\nPhoto: NHRA.\n\nLike most of his fellow NHRA team owners, Force has had to make some very\ntough business decisions because of the financial impact of the outbreak.\n\nHe admits he\u2019s had to lay off some employees, furlough others without pay and\ncut hours to just 20 per week for others.\n\n\u201cI had to make the payroll I could afford,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding anyone,\nI made cuts. My people worked with me, or I would have had to close the doors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing whatever it takes to save my company. We went to everywhere we\ncould cut to survive. I know my people. I want to apologize to them for all\nthis rough stuff, what it\u2019s doing to their families, their homes, their\ncollege funds. But we\u2019re going to make it and put it back together as quick as\nI can.\u201d\n\nForce knows and understands that some of the employees he was forced to lay\noff, furlough or cut their hours are actively looking for other jobs.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018Hey, make all the money you can while you can,\u2019\u201d Force said.\nThen he added with a half-humorous, half-serious tone: \u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, if\nthey\u2019d like a 16-time Funny Car champ to drive that concrete truck, I will be\nthere.\u201d\n\nAs painful as the job cuts have been, Force also knows he has several dozen\nemployees still relying upon him. It\u2019s a responsibility he doesn\u2019t take\nlightly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people that look at me as a leader and be negative,\u201d he said. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do that. I\u2019m going to be positive. That demon is at the door, but I\nain\u2019t going to let him in. I just ain\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI laid in a hospital bed with arms and legs broke, and they told me I was\ndone. I was never even going to walk again. And I showed them. I came back,\nand I still won.\u201d\n\nFor nearly a half-century, Force\u2019s life has been chasing trophies and winner\u2019s\nchecks. While he laughs about not knowing what to do with himself, he once\nagain turns serious about how the current pandemic is actually good for\nsomething: Making up for missed quality time with his family.\n\n\u201cHalf of us are workaholics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work every day to feed our kids. We\ndon\u2019t get to see our kids or grandkids. We don\u2019t get to enjoy our home. I\nbitch that I\u2019ve been in my pool just once in the last year, why did I build\nit?\n\n\u201cBut now you\u2019ve got an opportunity to go home, turn off the switch, which is\nthe hardest thing in the world for me. To turn my mind off. Sit on that couch\nand be with your children.\n\n\u201cYou wish you could have done that for the last 10, 20, 30, 40 or even 50\nyears in my case, and now you can finally go home. I\u2019m looking for anything\nthat\u2019s positive.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2015/09/2015_john_force_head-e1462390650756.jpg?w=320)Force\ntries to keep smiling, but it's not easy for him given what's happening in the\nworld. Photo: NHRA.\n\nForce also is trying to stay connected with his legions of fans. He recently\nspent a day filming videos and other content that will be parsed out on his\nsocial media channels as well as on John Force Racing\u2019s website for the next\nfew weeks.\n\n\u201cWe want to show our sponsors we\u2019re still alive, and we know there\u2019s fans out\nthere that need to be entertained,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to help people.\u201d\n\nForce then paused and said he wanted to impart a message, even chuckling when\nhe referred to one of his rivals:\n\n\u201cI just want to say to all the racers and NHRA people, I miss you and love you\nguys, even though we fight all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cNHRA is going to be back.\nYou\u2019ve got to stay positive.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I missed it, going 300 mph, fighting the fight.\nHell, I even miss Hagan (fellow Funny Car driver and one of his biggest\nrivals, Matt Hagan).

That\nrace was postponed, and the races that followed have been canceled or\nrescheduled later in the year. The season tentatively is scheduled to start\nJune 6 at Texas Motor Speedway.\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the reason for the tentative\nnature of this year\u2019s 2020 NTT IndyCar Series schedule.\n\nKanaan, the 2004 IndyCar Series champion and 2013 Indianapolis 500 winner,\nstarted the season with a limited schedule for A.J. Foyt Racing in the No. 14\nChevrolet. That schedule included all five oval races, including the 104th\nIndianapolis 500.\n\nA silver lining for Kanaan is that this year\u2019s trip to Iowa Speedway will be a\ndoubleheader, instead of a single oval contest. His schedule has grown from\nfive to six races for 2020, should the season start on time with the June 6\ncontest at Texas Motor Speedway and the additional race at Iowa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that IndyCar has been very proactive about the schedule and\nkeeping us posted with the plans,\u201d Kanaan told NBCSports.com Tuesday afternoon\nfrom his home in Indianapolis. \u201cI\u2019m double happy that now with Iowa being a\ndoubleheader, I\u2019m doing six races instead of five.\u201d\n\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/222_8621_2020021073320329_20200211092446.jpg?w=181)Photo\nby Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nKanaan\u2019s \u201cLast Lap\u201d is something that many fans and competitors in IndyCar\nwant to celebrate. He has been a fierce foe on the track but also a valued\nfriend outside the car to many of his fellow racers.\n\nHe also has been quite popular with fans and likely is the most popular\nIndianapolis 500 driver of his generation.\n\n[Scott Dixon](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/02/indycar-scott-\ndixon-chip-ganassi-racing-pit-fit-indianapolis-staying-fit-covid-19-layoff/)\nwas Kanaan\u2019s teammate at [Chip Ganassi\nRacing](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/03/31/chip-ganassi-racing-\nindycar-sense-of-direction-covid-19season-is-on-hold/) from 2013-17. At one\ntime, they were foes but eventually became friends.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s not T.K.\u2019s last 500,\u201d Dixon told NBCSports.com. \u201cI was hoping\nT.K. would get a full season. That has changed. His first race of what was\ngoing to his regular season was going to be the 500. Hopefully, that plays\nout.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at T.K. for who he is, what he has accomplished and what he\nhas done for the sport. He has been massive for the Indianapolis 500, for the\ncity of Indianapolis to the whole culture of the sport. He is a legend of the\nsport.\n\n\u201cWe had our differences early in our career and had problems in 2002 and 2003\nand 2004 when we were battling for championships. We fought for race wins and\nchampionships in the 2000s. I\u2019ve been on both sides, where he was fighting\nagainst me in a championship or where he was fighting with me to go for a\nchampionship. He is a hell of a competitor; a fantastic person.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s not his last, but if it is, I hope it\u2019s an extremely successful\none for him this season.\u201d\n\nEven before Kanaan joined Chip Ganassi Racing, Dixon admitted he couldn\u2019t help\nbut be drawn to Kanaan's personality.\n\n\u201cT.K. is a very likable person,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cYou just have to go to dinner\nwith the guy once, and you understand why that is. The ups and downs were a\ncompetitive scenario where he was helping you for a win or helping someone\nelse for a win. There was never a dislike or distrust. We always got along\nvery well.\n\n\u201cWe are very tight right now and really close. He is a funny-ass dude. He has\nalways been a really good friend for me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nBack in 2003 when both had come to the old Indy Racing League after beginning\ntheir careers in CART, the two drivers were racing hard for the lead at Twin\nRing Motegi in Japan on April 13, 2003. They were involved in a hard crash in\nTurn 2 that left Kanaan broken up with injuries. IRL officials penalized Dixon\nfor \u201caggressive driving.\" Dixon had to sit out the first three days of\npractice for the next race \u2013 the 2003 Indianapolis 500.\n\nKanaan recovered in time and did not miss any racing. He started second and\nfinished third in that year\u2019s Indy 500.\n\n\u201cWe were racing hard and going for the win,\u201d Dixon recalled of the Motegi\nrace. \u201cIt was a crucial part of the season. Everybody has to be aggressive. I\nrespect Tony for that. He was not letting up. That is what I always saw with\nTony, how hard the guy will push. He will go to the absolute limit, and that\nis why he was inspiring and why he was a successful driver.\n\n\u201cThose moments are blips. You might not talk to the guy for a week, but then\nyou are back on track. T.K. is very close with our family and we are with\nhis.\u201d\n\nThis season, because of highly unusual circumstances, T.K.\u2019s IndyCar career\nwill last for one more race than previously scheduled.\n\n[Follow Bruce Martin on Twitter at @BruceMartin_500\n](https://twitter.com/BruceMartin_500)\n\nTags: [AJ Foyt Racing](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/aj-foyt-racing/),\n[Chevrolet](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/chevrolet/), [Chip\nGanassi](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/chip-ganassi/),\n[Firestone](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/firestone/), [Indianapolis\n500](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/indianapolis-500/),\n[IndyCar](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/indycar/), [Iowa\nSpeedway](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/iowa-speedway/), [Ironman\nStreak](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/ironman-streak/), [NTT IndyCar\nSeries](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/ntt-indycar-series/), [Scott\nDixon](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/scott-dixon/), [Tony\nKanaan](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/tag/tony-kanaan/), [Scott\nDixon](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/athlete/scott-dixon/), [Tony\nKanaan](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/athlete/tony-kanaan/)\n\n[Leave a comment](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/indycars-\nrevised-schedule-gives-tony-kanaan-an-extra-race-in-2020/#respond)\n\nLatest MOTOR SPORTS TALK | NBC SPORTS\n\n[ ![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/JGS-2019-LAGUNA-\nSECA-277726-1-e1586294570871.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1) IndyCar\u2019s revised schedule\ngives Tony Kanaan an extra race in 2020 April 7, 2020 5:26 pm\n](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/indycars-revised-schedule-\ngives-tony-kanaan-an-extra-race-in-2020/) [\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/gettyimages-1153530186-e1586291964410.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1)\nJuan Pablo Montoya joins World of Outlaws iRacing craze April 7, 2020 4:46 pm\n](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/juan-pablo-montoya-joins-\noutlaws-iracing-craze/) [ ![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/GettyImages-971145812.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1)\nCanadian Grand Prix postponed because of COVID-19 April 7, 2020 4:01 pm\n](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/canadian-grand-prix-postponed-\ndue-to-covid-19/) [ ![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/GettyImages-1156304310-e1586277189615.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1)\nMotoGP pushes season to June with postponements of Italy and Spain April 7,\n2020 12:50 pm ](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/motogp-postpones-\ntwo-more-june-races-in-italy-and-spain/) [\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/16C2892-1.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1) April 7 in\nMotorsports History: Late tire stop propels Josef Newgarden April 7, 2020\n10:00 am ](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/josef-newgarden-\nrobert-wickens-james-hinchcliffe-alexander-rossi-april-7-in-motorsports-\nhistory-phoenix-raceway/) [ ![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/AtSwindellSpdLab-Kevin-Swindell-\nSprint-e1586213956572.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1) After paralysis, Kevin Swindell\nfuels competitive spirit with iRacing April 7, 2020 9:00 am\n](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/kevin-swindell-esports-world-\nof-outlaws-paralysis-iracing-esports/) [\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/GettyImages-1216846911.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1)\nHere are the (unofficial) IndyCar iRacing Challenge points standings April 7,\n2020 7:00 am ](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/indycar-iracing-\nchallenge-unofficial-points-standings-scott-mclaughlin-will-power-felix-\nrosenqvist-sage-karam-simon-pagenaud-scott-dixon-alexander-rossi/) [\n![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/GETTYIMAGES-1205633260-e1586214458328.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1)\nNew schedule has Josef Newgarden seeing double (points) again in 2020 April 6,\n2020 7:10 pm ](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/04/06/indycar-josef-\nnewgarden-revised-schedule-double-points-indianapolis-motor-speedway-team-\npenske-detroit-iowa-laguna-seca/) [ ![](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/Dale-\nJr.-I-e1586207656826.jpg?w=128&h=72&crop=1) Dale Jr. wants to try IndyCar\niRacing;

But this isn\u2019t entirely good news for workers, whether\nthey\u2019re men _or_ women.\n\nThe difference is small, but it reflects the fact that women have been doing\nbetter in the labor market compared with men. One big reason is that the\noccupations that are shrinking tend to be male-dominated, like manufacturing,\nwhile those that are growing remain female-dominated, like health care and\neducation. That puts men at a disadvantage in today\u2019s economy \u2014 but it also\nensures that the female-dominated jobs remain devalued and underpaid.\n\n\u201cFemale-dominated jobs in the working class are just not comparable to men\u2019s\njobs,\u201d said Janette Dill, **** a sociologist at the University of Minnesota\nSchool of Public Health. \u201cSo yes, it\u2019s great to see women participating at\nsuch a high level in the labor market, but it also really means continuing\nchallenges for working-class families, because these jobs just don\u2019t replace\nmanufacturing jobs in terms of job quality and wages.\u201d\n\nWomen now hold 50.04 percent of payroll jobs (which excludes people who work\non farms or in households or are self-employed), according to the Labor\nDepartment\u2019s [jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)\nthis month. (Men are still a larger share of the labor force than women, a\nnumber that is calculated differently \u2014 it includes people who don\u2019t have jobs\nbut are looking for work; farm and household workers; and self-employed\npeople.)\n\nThe only other time women have held more jobs was in mid-2010, when men were\nhit particularly hard by the recession and the decline in construction and\nmanufacturing jobs. This time, the economy is thriving \u2014 but women seem better\nable to take advantage of it.\n\nReasons for the [decline in work for less educated\nmen](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/upshot/unemployment-the-vanishing-\nmale-worker-how-america-fell-behind.html) are many. They include the [rise of\nautomation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/upshot/the-long-term-jobs-\nkiller-is-not-china-its-automation.html); the waning power of unions; rising\nincarceration rates; the factories that move overseas; and hurdles to\n[switching jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/upshot/switching-careers-\nis-hard-it-doesnt-have-to-be.html) like having to move away or return to\nschool. But gender norms are a major and often overlooked factor. However much\npoliticians talk about manufacturing jobs, the United States economy has\n[become service-dominated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/upshot/economy-\nin-a-nutshell-manufacturing-in-recession-services-booming.html) \u2014 and jobs\nhelping people have typically been done by women, while jobs making things\nhave been associated with men.\n\n### Sectors that gained jobs\n\nSector | Job change,  \nNov.-Dec. 2019 | Pct. women  \n---|---|---  \nRetail | +41,200 | 48%  \nHospitality | +40,000 | 52%  \nHealth care | +28,100 | 78%  \nConstruction | +20,000 | 10%  \nBusiness services | +10,000 | 42%  \nChild care and social services | +5,800 | 84%  \nEducation | +1,300 | 68%  \n  \n### Sectors that lost jobs\n\nSector | Job change,  \nNov.-Dec. 2019 | Pct. women  \n---|---|---  \nMining | -7,600 | 14%  \nTransport and warehousing | -10,400 | 24%  \nManufacturing | -12,000 | 29%  \n  \n##### Pct. women\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50%\n\nExcluding farm workers and self-employed people.\n\nSource: United States Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nWomen\u2019s success in the labor market has been driven by their educational\ngains, and by [black and Hispanic\nwomen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/economy/minority-women-\nhispanics-jobs.html). While women in large numbers have moved into male-\ndominated jobs, especially professional ones, the reverse isn\u2019t true. ****\nWomen are 84 percent of social services workers and 78 percent of health care\nworkers. Differences in the jobs that men and women choose are now the single\nlargest cause of the gender pay gap, [accounting for more than half of\nit](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9656.pdf), research by the economists Francine Blau\nand Lawrence Kahn has found.\n\nSex segregation is much more prevalent in working-class jobs than in white-\ncollar ones. But even the more [prestigious female-dominated\njobs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/04/upshot/male-nurses.html),\nlike nurse practitioner or high school teacher, have [failed to\nattract](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413487197?journalCode=asra)\nmany men. Yet when men do [so-called pink-collar\njobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/upshot/why-men-dont-want-the-jobs-\ndone-mostly-by-women.html), they tend to have more job security and wage\ngrowth over time than they would have in blue-collar jobs, [research has\nfound](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243215624656).\n\nOne reason men are reluctant to take pink-collar jobs is that over all, they\npay less than male-dominated ones. When women enter fields in greater numbers,\n[pay declines](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-\nmale-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html), the sociologist Paula England and\ncolleagues [have found](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-\nabstract/88/2/865/2235342). Jobs that involve caregiving, like health aide or\npreschool teacher, are [particularly low-\npaying](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000271629956100103), even\nafter controlling for the high share of female workers, other work by Ms.\nEngland has found.\n\nMost workers have in mind the lowest wage they\u2019re willing to accept in a new\njob, [economists say](https://www.nber.org/digest/jun14/w19870.html), and men\nwho have left higher-paying manufacturing and construction jobs might be\nunwilling to take a large pay cut.\n\n\u201cThe wages that nursing assistants and home health aides get, and child care\nworkers and teachers get, communicate to society that these jobs are not\nvalued compared to male-dominated jobs, so of course men don\u2019t want to do\nthat,\u201d Ms. Dill said.\n\nAnother thing holding men back from service jobs is norms about masculinity.\nThe markers of masculinity include earning a good income and distancing\noneself from feminine things, research has shown. Taking a job traditionally\ndone by women threatens both, said Jill Yavorsky, a sociologist at the\nUniversity of North Carolina, Charlotte.\n\nA new experiment found that when unemployed men looked at job postings, they\nwere willing to take a job that employed mostly women. But if it called for\nstereotypically female traits like interpersonal skills or care work, they\nwere not, found Ms. Dill, Ms. Yavorsky and Enrica Ruggs at the University of\nMemphis. Moreover, a study [published in\nDecember](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-\nabstract/98/2/461/5288671?redirectedFrom=fulltext) by Ms. Yavorsky found that\nmen, across education levels and job types, were less likely to be called back\nby employers for interviews when they applied for traditionally female roles.\n\nAlso, social scientists have observed that women seem to show more flexibility\nthan men in training for and moving to new industries. Women who worked in\nmanufacturing were hit harder than men during the recession, but they were\nalso [more likely than men](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/upshot/more-\nmen-are-taking-womens-jobs-at-least-certain-men.html) to move into high-skill\njobs and health care jobs.\n\nThe men who have gone into pink-collar work have viewed these jobs as [a last\nresort](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2hzpv/) **** after facing\ndisadvantages in the labor market, [researchers have\nfound](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol38/5/38-5.pdf). They\nare [more likely to\nbe](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tsq.12152) black or\nHispanic and to have had the least education and the lowest earnings. Even\nthough pink-collar jobs pay less over all, the men who take them often earn\nmore than they had in jobs like manual labor, found a [paper published this\nmonth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X19301292) by\nMs. Dill and Ms. Yavorsky, using census data from 2004 to 2013.\n\nWhen men take female-dominated jobs, they\u2019re more likely than not [to use them\nas a stopgap](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0730888418780433),\nand return to a male-dominated job as soon as they can, found Margarita Torre\nFern\u00e1ndez, a sociologist at the University Carlos III of Madrid. Using data\nfrom the census and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth from 1979 to\n2006, she found this happened in nearly every female-dominated occupation,\nparticularly elementary school teaching, health technology and social work.\n\n\u201cSome men would rather endure unemployment than accept a relatively high-\npaying women\u2019s job and suffer the potential social stigma,\u201d [she\nwrote](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2019/01/29/the-flip-side-of-\nsegregation-men-in-typically-female-jobs/).\n\nPolicymakers and recruiters have discussed various ways to address this issue,\nlike bringing back manufacturing jobs, or emphasizing the masculine qualities\nof service jobs. But there\u2019s another solution, researchers say: improving the\nquality of pink-collar jobs, in terms of wages, stability, benefits and hours.\nThat could both attract men to these jobs and also benefit women.\n\n\u201cThere are immense economic benefits to these jobs,\u201d Ms. Yavorsky said.\n\u201cInevitably, if they were more highly valued in our society, I think men would\nbe more likely to enter them, and women would very much benefit from the\nhigher wages.\u201d\n\nImproving the quality of pink-collar, working-class jobs has the potential to\nclose gender gaps \u2014 and also to shrink the widening gaps between the highest\nand lowest earners, both women and men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * [\u00a9 2020 The New York Times Company](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792127-Copyright-notice)\n\n  * [NYTCo](https://www.nytco.com/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015385887-Contact-Us)\n  * [Work with us](https://www.nytco.com/careers/)\n  * [Advertise](https://nytmediakit.com/)\n  * [T Brand Studio](http://www.tbrandstudio.com/)\n  * [Your Ad Choices](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Privacy](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Terms of Service](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service)\n  * [Terms of Sale](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale)\n  * [Site Map](https://spiderbites.nytimes.com)\n  * [Help](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us)\n  * [Subscriptions](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=37WXW)\n  * \n\n"}, {"item": "Money Matters: Cleveland Indians Plan Another Reduced Payroll - Forbes", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/2020/02/03/money-matters-cleveland-indians-plan-another-reduced-payroll/", "guid": "CAIiEEEbhR1lktoax_q-nBRvjekqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg", "pubdate": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 23:10:59 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/2020/02/03/money-matters-cleveland-indians-plan-another-reduced-payroll/\" target=\"_blank\">Money Matters: Cleveland Indians Plan Another Reduced Payroll</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Forbes</font>", "source": "Forbes", "body": "Sign in to your Forbes account or\n\nregister\n\n## Please help us continue to provide you with free, quality journalism by\nturning off your ad blocker on our site.\n\nFor instructions on how to disable your ad blocker, [click\nhere.](https://www.forbes.com/adblock/instructions/)\n\n[I\u2019ve Turned Off My Ad\nBlocker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/2020/02/03/money-matters-\ncleveland-indians-plan-another-reduced-payroll/)\n\nOr Sign In To Continue Using An Ad Blocker\n\n### Thank you for signing in.\n\nIf this is your first time registering, please check your inbox for more\ninformation about the benefits of your Forbes account and what you can do\nnext!\n\n  * I agree to receive occasional updates and announcements about Forbes products and services.

[+] Fame induction before the game between the\nCleveland Indians and the Oakland Athletics at Progressive Field on July 30,\n2016 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nCleveland Indians fans are getting restless. Many are angry. They are watching\nhelplessly as the team is once again reducing the player payroll.\n\nThe Dolan Family Trust purchased the Cleveland Indians for $323M from Richard\nJacobs on January 19, 2000.\n\nForbes ranks the 2019 value of the Cleveland Indians at $1.15B. Of the 30\nmajor league baseball clubs, the team is ranked 25th in financial value. Only\nOakland ($1.1B) Cincinnati ($1.05B) Kansas City ($1.05B) Tampa Bay (1.01B) and\nMiami ($1B) are listed below Cleveland. Not one franchise is valued less than\n$1B. Owning a baseball franchise is a lucrative venture.\n\nCleveland won the American League Central Division in 2018 with 91 wins. In\n2019 ownership cut the payroll. Even with a reduced player payroll, the team\nwon 93 games last season, but missed the playoffs. So far this offseason,\npayroll has been cut once again, from an estimated $124M to an estimated $97M.\n\nNow, deep into this offseason, Indians fans are upset with the lack of any\nimpact player additions from either the free agent market or trades. Fans\npoint to reduced payrolls in consecutive seasons when the window of\nopportunity to win a World Series was, and may still be open.\n\nToday In: [SportsMoney](https://www.forbes.com/sportsmoney)\n\n  * [\n\n### EXCLUSIVE: FC Barcelona Striker\u2019s Uncle Files For $50 Million IPO: \u2018We\nWant To Create 100,000 New Millionaires\u2019\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpettigrove/2020/04/08/exclusive-fc-\nbarcelona-strikers-uncle-files-for-50-million-ipo-we-want-to-\ncreate-100000-new-millionaires/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Mark Cuban Will Continue Paying His Employees Amid Coronavirus-Induced\nEconomic Downturn\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2020/04/08/mark-cuban-continue-\npaying-employees-coronavirus-economic-downturn/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Report: UFC 249 To Take Place At Tachi Palace In California\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2020/04/07/report-ufc-249-to-\ntake-place-at-tachi-palace-in-california/)\n\nThe Cleveland Indians have not won a World Series since 1948.\n\nAttendance in Cleveland has dropped from 2.05 million in 2017 to 1.93 million\nin 2018 to 1.74 million last season. To be fair, Major League Baseball has\nseen an alarming drop in attendance over the past few years.\n\nIt is estimated attendance revenue for Cleveland totaled $58M.\n\nOwnership of the Indians under Paul Dolan can certainly argue their attendance\ndoes not warrant payroll increases. That, coupled with an estimated\ncomparatively low $40M in local television rights fees give Dolan an easy\nargument for cutting payroll.\n\nA closer look at television money alone reveals an estimated $137M annual\ntelevision rights value when both revenue sharing money (roughly $6M) and\nnational television contract rights ($91M) are added.\n\nIt should be noted that television ratings for Cleveland games are among the\nhighest in baseball. The local rights fees just don\u2019t seem to square with the\nviewership.\n\nTicket sales, suite and luxury box rentals, television rights, radio rights,\nconcession stand proceeds, sales of souvenirs and team clothing, parking fees\nand other revenue streams certainly add to the bottom line.\n\nFor the Dolan family, ownership of the Indians is their primary source of\nincome. Unlike many other MLB owners, Paul Dolan isn\u2019t the CEO of another\ncompany or industry.\n\nRegardless of how one looks at the money involved with the team, Cleveland\nIndians ownership has alienated many fans with repeated references to the team\nlosing money every year. Ownership also brings up the smaller market size and\ndwindling Greater Cleveland population as reasons for cutting payroll. In\ngeneral, fans don\u2019t buy it. They are well aware of the various revenue streams\nin baseball.\n\nWhen speaking publicly about signing All Star Francisco Lindor to a contract\nextension, Paul Dolan advised fans to \u201cEnjoy him. We control him for three\nmore years. Enjoy him and then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d For those comments,\nDolan earned plenty of negative feedback. Instead of encouraging fans that the\nteam will continue to try everything possible to sign Lindor, Dolan gave the\nimpression that signing him would be hopeless. \u201cEnjoy him while you have him\u201d\nisn\u2019t what Indians fans want to hear.\n\nAt Tribe Fest, Lindor indicated his main goal is to win. \u201cI\u2019m not money\ndriven, I\u2019m championship driven.\u201d But he wants to be paid fairly. Lindor is\nwell aware of the money other clubs have spent on premiere players.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound jealous, he just wants to be paid in accordance with his\nvalue.\n\nComplicating matters for the Dolan family is the incredible progress of their\nstate rival Cincinnati Reds. The Reds are making bold, expensive moves to\nimprove their fate and future.\n\nThe Reds have spent $166M on free agents this offseason.\n\nDivision rival Minnesota signed third baseman Josh Donaldson to a four-year\ncontract worth $92M. Donaldson played for Cleveland in late 2018. The Indians\ndid not choose to sign Donaldson to an extension at that time. As a free\nagent, he signed with Atlanta for the 2019 season.\n\nDivision rival Chicago signed free agent catcher Yasmani Grandal to a four-\nyear contract worth $73M.\n\nHe joins Nomar Mazara, who was obtained by the White Sox in trade to help\nstrengthen their offensive production. They also signed former Indians slugger\nEdwin Encarnacion, who was traded in the third year of his three-year\nCleveland contract.\n\nThe White Sox also added left-handed starting pitchers Dallas Keuchel\n(3-years, $55M) and Gio Gonzalez (1-year, $5M) as free agents.\n\nFans concerns are well placed. Their concerns are real. They know the team\ngreatly needs a powerful right-handed hitting outfielder. They don\u2019t believe\ncutting $44M of payroll in two years is the way to win.\n\nSo far this offseason, Cleveland has traded Corey Kluber and his $18.5M salary\nto Texas for outfielder Delino DeShields Jr. and pitcher Emmanuel Clase.\nDeShields Jr. makes $1.875M. Clase will make less than $600,000. Some of\nKluber\u2019s money was spent on second baseman Cesar Hernandez, who will be paid\n$6.25M on his one-year contract.\n\nIt can\u2019t be forgotten that second baseman Jason Kipnis is now off the payroll\nas well. He made close to $15M before leaving as a free agent. Danny Salazar,\nan injured pitcher who tried to return last year but was unsuccessful, made\n$4.5M. And there are other departed Cleveland players and their salaries that\nlikely fit in the overall financial equation.\n\nPaul Dolan recently won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Greater Cleveland\nSports Awards dinner. It was well deserved. Dolan and the rest of his family\nhave been outstanding community citizens shepherding the franchise with class\nand dignity in civic matters.\n\nWhile fans admire the Dolan family for their community contributions, they\nwonder how the team will compete as other clubs in their division gain\nstrength with increasing team payrolls?\n\nCleveland\u2019s baseball fans should be careful what they wish for. Indians fans\nmay have issues with Mr. Dolan, but they probably unanimously prefer his\nownership to that of Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam. Haslam has spent a\nboatload of money while creating an unstable, frenetic and chaotic Browns team\nenvironment since he was awarded the franchise.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians front office has done masterful work balancing the needs\nand requirements of a winning baseball team with a payroll that has been\nrepeatedly reduced.\n\nThe Dolan Family Trust may not see a return on their investment until they\nsell the club.\n\nUntil then, fans are clamoring for new additions to help the team climb\nthrough a window that may slam shut if impact player reinforcements are not\nforthcoming.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/BerniePleskoff).\n\n[![Bernie\nPleskoff](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cc0afb14d36f6fbf3f336d230a0b7aa?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/\n\"Photo of Bernie Pleskoff\")\n\n[Bernie Pleskoff](https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/)\n\nAfter serving as a Dean of Campus Life at Loyola University Chicago for\nseveral decades, I began a transition to my lifetime dream-working in\nbaseball.

The company is based in\nSingapore and operates in eight markets across Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore,\nTaiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. In some markets\nit has expanded to food deliveries and, in Singapore, it operates an Alibaba-\nstyle online/offline store called [Habitat](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-\nreleases/honestbee-launches-a-worlds-first-newgen-retail-concept-habitat-by-\nhonestbee-a-one-of-a-kind-tech-enabled-multi-sensory-grocery-and-dining-\nexperience-300731511.html).\n\nThe company makes its money by taking a cut of transactions from consumer\ntransactions, while it also monetizes delivery services separately.\n\nDespite looking impressive from the outside, the company is currently in\ncrisis mode due to a cash crunch -- there's a lot happening right now.\n\nFrom talking to several former and current staff, [TechCrunch\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch) has come to learn that\nHonestbee is laying off employees, it has a range of suppliers who are owed\nmoney, it has \"paused\" its business in the Philippines, it has closed R&D\ncenters in Vietnam and India, it isn't going to make payroll in some markets\nand a range of executives have quit the firm in recent months.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/habitate-honestbee.jpeg)\n\nHonestbee's Habitat store includes a cashless and automated checkout\nexperience, among other online-offline services\n\nThe issue is that the company is running out of money thanks to a business\nmodel with tight margins that's largely unproven in Asia Pacific.\n\nOne source told TechCrunch that the company doesn't currently have the funds\nto pay its staff this month. A source inside the company confirmed that\n[Honestbee ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/honestbee) has told\nSingapore-based staff that they won't be paid in time, but it isn't clear\nabout employees based in other markets. Previously, staff have been paid\ninconsistently -- with late salary payments sent as bank transfers happening\ntwice this year, according to the source.\n\nOne reason that the Philippines business has closed temporarily -- [as Tech In\nAsia first reported this week](https://www.techinasia.com/honestbee-\ntemporarily-suspends-philippine-operations-notice) -- is that it is out money,\nand waiting on Honestbee HQ in Singapore to provide further capital. Already,\nthe saga has proven to be too much for Honestbee's head of the Philippines --\nCrystal Gonzalez -- who has quit the company, according to a source within\nHonestbee Philippines.\n\nGonzalez helped build [Viber's ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/viber-\nmedia) business in the Philippines, where it is a top messaging player, and\nshe was previously with [Yahoo ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/yahoo)\nbefore launching Honestbee. She is said to have grown frustrated at a lack of\nfunds when the Philippines is the company's best-performing market on paper.\n\nIndeed, the situation is so dire that suppliers and partners have been paid\nlate, or left unpaid entirely, in the Philippines and other markets. Honestbee\ntakes payment for grocery deliveries, after which it is supposed to provide\nthe transaction, minus its cut, to its supermarket partners. But it has been\nslow to pay vendors, with two in Singapore -- FairPrice and U Stars -- cutting\nties with the startup.\n\n## Unclear financing\n\nOn the subject of financials, Honestbee looks to be toward the end of its\nrunway.\n\nThe company has always taken a fairly secretive line on its financing. On\nlaunch, [it announced](https://www.techinasia.com/honestbee-series-a-funding)\na $15 million Series A investment from Formation8, a firm which included\n[Honestbee CEO Joel Sng as a\npartner](https://formation8.com/resources/formation-8-welcomes-joel-sng-as-\npartner/), but it has said nothing more since. (It appears that Honestbee\nstake has transferred to the firm's successor, Formation Group, [according to\nits website](http://formationgroup.com/company/honest-bee/).) [Tech In Asia\ndug up filings](https://www.techinasia.com/honestbee-raised-46m-series-\nbiggest-backer-korean-chaebol) last year that show it has raised a further $46\nmillion from more Korean investors, but the startup declined to comment on its\nfinancing when contacted by TechCrunch.\n\nIt looks like that capital is nearly gone, at least based on what has been\ndeclared.\n\nInternal numbers for Honestbee in December 2018, seen by TechCrunch, show that\nit lost nearly $6.5 million, with around $2.5 million in net revenue for the\nmonth. GMV -- the total amount of transactions on its platform before\ndeductions to partners -- reached nearly $12.5 million in December, but costs\n-- chiefly discounts to lure new customers and online marketing spend --\ndragged the company down. A former employee said that monthly retention is\noften single-digit percent in some markets because of the \"outrageous\" use of\ncoupons to hit short-term revenue goals.\n\nThat internal data showed that the Philippines business accounted for around\n40 percent of Honestbee's overall GMV, which backs up Gonzalez' apparent\nfrustration at a lack of investment. That said, the Philippines unit remains\nsome way from profitability, with a net loss of more than $1 million in\nDecember.\n\n## High burn rate\n\nThree markets -- Singapore, the Philippines and Taiwan -- accounted for more\nthan 80 percent of GMV and net income, making it unclear why Honestbee\ncontinues to operate in other countries, including the expensive Japanese\nmarket, when its funding level is perilously low.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brian-Koo.jpg?w=300)\n\nBrian Koo, whose family controls LG, is listed as a shareholder for both of\nHonestbee's ventures registered in Singapore. His Formation 8 VC firm has\nprovided significant funding for the startup.\n\nMore pertinently, operating at that burn rate would give Honestbee less than\n10 months of runway if it used the $61 million capital float that it is known\nto have raised. That suggests that the company has raised more money; however,\nnone of the sources who spoke to TechCrunch were able to verify whether there\nhas been additional fundraising.\n\nCurrent and former employees explained that Honestbee doesn't have a CFO and\nthat all high-level decisions, and particularly those around budgets and\nspending, are managed by CEO Sng and his right-hand man, Roger Koh, whose\nLinkedIn lists his current job as a principal with Formation 8.\n\nFilings in Singapore indicate that Honestbee has $55.9 million in assets\nthrough two registered companies. A common shareholder across the two is\n[Brian Koo, ](https://crunchbase.com/person/brian-koo) a member of the [LG\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/lg) family who founded the Formation 8\nfund, and the Formation Fund which launched after Formation 8 was shuttered.\n\n## Layoffs and a potential sale\n\nWhile the financials are hazy, it is very clear that Honestbee is up against\nit right now.\n\nThe company released a statement earlier this week that makes some admissions\naround layoffs and restructuring but still glosses over current struggles:\n\n> In 2014, honestbee started in Singapore with the mission of providing a\n> positive social and financial impact on the lives and businesses that we\n> touch. Today, we are a regional business with footprints in Hong Kong,\n> Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, Philippines, Japan and Malaysia.\n>\n> Over the years, we have continued to be committed to our staff, partners and\n> consumers. We have made good progress to implement new process and ways of\n> working to remain efficient and relevant in the ever-changing business\n> environment. The launch of habitat by honestbee in Singapore was a valuable\n> lesson for us where it showed the potential growth in the O2O business and\n> *it has been voted one of the must-see retail innovations in the world this\n> year.\n>\n> Following a strategic review of our company\u2019s business, we are temporarily\n> suspending our food verticals in Hong Kong and Thailand to simplify what we\n> do and how we do it to better meet what our consumers want. Some roles\n> within the organization will no longer be available. Approximately 6% of our\n> global headcount in the organization are affected.\n>\n> The status of honestbee in the remaining markets remain unchanged as we\n> evaluate and we will continue to operate and contribute to honestbee Pte\n> Ltd.\n\nSources close to the company told TechCrunch that more job losses are likely\nto come beyond the six percent in this statement. Executives who saw the\nwriting on the wall have left in recent months, including the heads of\nbusiness for Japan and Indonesia, a senior member of the team behind Habitat\nand the company's head of people. One executive hired to raise capital for\nHonestbee quit within a month; he declined to comment and doesn't list the\ncompany on his LinkedIn bio.\n\nSecondly, Honestbee's temporary suspension of food services in Hong Kong and\nThailand isn't likely to have a huge impact on its overall business, as\ngroceries are the primary focus and neither market is particularly huge for\nthe company. While Habitat has gotten attention for its forward-thinking, a\nphysical retail store will require significant capital and it is likely, in\nits early days, to only increase the burn rate. Sources in the company told\nTechCrunch that, already, it has switched suppliers for some items as invoices\nwent unpaid.\n\nDespite the chaos, the potential of a sale is real.\n\nFresh from [a recent $1.5 billion Vision Fund\ninvestment](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/grab-vision-fund/) with [the\npromise of $2 billion more this\nyear](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/grab-6-5-billion/), Grab -- which is\nvalued at $14 billion -- is on a spending spree.\n\nThe Singapore-based company has pledged to make at least half a dozen\nacquisitions in 2019 and a deal to boost its nascent food and grocery play in\nSoutheast Asia has some merit. Grab has the challenge of competing with Go-\nJek, [its $9.5 billion-valued rival](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/go-jek-\nseries-f-first-close/) that built a strong offering in Indonesia and is\nexpanding across Southeast Asia with an emphasis on its food delivery. Grab,\nmeanwhile, is active in eight markets across Southeast Asia and is now\nactively expanding from transportation services to food and more.\n\nLikely adding to the frustration for Honestbee, its rival [HappyFresh this\nweek announced a $20 million\ninvestment](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/21/happyfresh-20-million/).\nHappyFresh has undergone tough times, too. [It pulled out of markets in\n2016](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/happyfresh-series-b/) to make its\nbusiness more sustainable and today its CEO Guillem Segarra told TechCrunch\nthat it is now operationally profitable.\n\nHonestbee declined to respond to a range of questions from TechCrunch on\nwhether it has plans to sell its business, its financing history and whether\nit has delayed paying employees.\n\n_Update: The original version of this story has been updated to note\nthat[Formation Group ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/formation-group) is\nnot the parent of Formation

For example, Sanders is proposing a wealth tax and an\nextensive restructuring on income tax brackets.

(The current 35% rate applies to a\nmarried couple making between $408,201 and $612,350, and $204,101 to $510,300\nfor singles.)\n\nSanders would add three more brackets, which apply rates of 45% for households\nmaking between $500,000 and $2 million, 50% for households making between $2\nmillion and $10 million and 52% for household making above $10 million, the\nTax Foundation noted.\n\nSanders would also apply a 12.4% payroll tax on wages above $250,000, the Tax\nFoundation said.\n\nOn Thursday, Sanders announced a proposal to change the tax rules on deferred\ncompensation for high-paid executives.

The US-China trade war, Brexit uncertainty, and\nnegative sentiments carried forward from the global financial crises have led\nto global GDP growth rate decelerating in 2019, to an estimated 2.4\n[percent](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-\nprospects%20 \"WorldBank\")\\- the lowest rate of expansion since the global\nfinancial crisis. The crises is real, because both advanced as well as\nemerging markets and developing economies (EMDE) have been affected, with only\na few exceptions showing prospective high growth. In 2020, GDP growth is\nexpected to rise slightly, at 2.5 percent (estimated) globally. Advanced\neconomies are set to further decelerate to 1.4 percent from 2019\u2019s 1.6\npercent. It is important to note that several EMDEs are expected to make a\ncomeback with a predicted 4.1 percent growth vis-\u00e0-vis 3.5 percent(estimated)\nfor 2019.\n\n### The India story\n\nIndia has been reeling under the effect of non-performance of certain sectors,\nmanufacturing and construction being primary culprits. According to the\nNational Statistical Office, the manufacturing sector output growth is\nexpected to decelerate to 2 percent in 2019-20, down from 6.9 percent in 2018.\nSimilarly, the construction sector growth is estimated at 3.2 percent as\nagainst 8.7 percent in [2018](https://www.business-\nstandard.com/article/economy-policy/gdp-first-advance-estimates-predict-\neconomic-growth-at-5-in-2019-2020-120010700990_1.html%20 \"Business Standard\").\nDespite this, it continues to be one of the better growth economies, with a\nprojected GDP growth rate of 5.8 percent against the 5 percent (estimate) of\nthe past year. A sense of high optimism prevails, owing to government policy\nand investor sentiment.\n\n### Flashback 2019 and expected salary trends for 2020\n\nSalary increases worldwide are expected to be 4.9 percent in 2020, a decrease\nfrom the forecasted 5.1 percent for 2019. But due to inflation falling to\nmerely 2.8 percent (2020) from 4.1 percent (2019), the real wage increase is\nexpected to be just 2.1 percent globally. Asia is expected to contribute to\nthe highest real-wage growth in 2020- salaries are forecast to grow by 5.3\npercent in 2020. Real-wage salaries which are inflation-adjusted are expected\nto be 3.1 percent, up from 2.6 percent last year.\n\nIndia is likely to see the highest salary growth in Asia at 9.2 percent in\n2020 followed by Indonesia at 8.1 percent and China at 6 percent, according to\nthe Korn Ferry Global salary\n[forecast](https://engage.kornferry.com/Global/FileLib/Pay/KF_2019_Salary_Forecast_Main_Infographic_Aw.pdf%20\n\"KornFerry\") . Adjusted for inflation, real-wage salaries in India are\nanticipated to be 5 percent. Despite the number not being so positive, India\nseems to be on the brighter side vis-\u00e0-vis Japan (0.6 percent real wage\nincrease) and China (2 percent real wage increase).\n\n### Next steps for HR\n\nWhile the absolute salary-increment predictions may give employees a temporary\nfeel-good factor, inflation-adjusted wage increases tell a different story.\nOrganizations can no longer rely on falling inflation and mere rewards to make\nemployees feel wealthier, and thereby feel engaged. There is a dire need for\nTotal Rewards specialists to make Rewards and Recognition more comprehensive.\nHR leaders and Rewards leaders must take a broader perspective to attract,\nengage and retain talent i.e. both candidates and employees. It is good to\nnote that this is the way ahead in Compensation Strategy- from mere Pay to\n\u201cTotal Rewards\u201d- a holistic basket of offerings that meets employees\u2019 needs,\nwants and aspirations on a professional and personal level. The good news for\norganizations is that modern employees such as millennials and Gen Z are\nexpecting the same. It is a win-win both ways- organizations that offer perks\nsuch as career development programs, contemporary learning avenues,\nchallenging assignments, mobility, challenging assignments, and a great\nculture have a better chance to hire and sustain top talent. Top leadership\ncan play a critical role here by driving a culture of openness, transparency,\ncoaching and mentoring, and basically \u201cwalking the talk\u201d, which is what\ninspires employees these days. Also, an organization which is progressive in\nits policies, and incorporates digital and flexible ways of working, is often\nlooked up to, and attracts in-demand talent such as native digitals.\n\nTo counter the effects of the changing remuneration landscape, and to make\nemployee engagement a reality, HR leaders must first develop a deep\nunderstanding of the core business. They must work closely with the CXO suite\nand define and agree upon the organization\u2019s own measures of cost drivers and\nbusiness strategy, in line with the macroeconomic environment and devise a\nbusiness-aligned talent strategy. HR must step up its business acumen, and\ntalk the business language so as to devise an effective Total Rewards\nPhilosophy and Strategy. Fostering high performance through a well-rewarded\nand engaged workforce demands this, along with an ongoing commitment to\nevolve.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Compensation &

And they\nare definitely on to something.\n\nRecent research on HR and employee engagement has produced compelling evidence\nof the benefits satisfied and engaged workers bring to both their\norganizations and themselves.\n\nJob satisfaction statistics highlight the fact that happy employees really\nmake a difference in any organization. Those who show up at work with an\neagerness to overcome challenges, solve problems, and achieve set goals are\nthe driving force of any business. Unfortunately, at the moment, only a third\nof the US workforce feels this enthusiastic about their job.\n\nThis puts the ball in the employers\u2019 court. They are the ones who can spike\nthese numbers by showing employees they truly care, by rewarding hard work and\ndedication, and by making employee wellness and engagement a priority. To\ndiscover how employee happiness can boost an organization\u2019s productivity and\nto learn how to deploy a winning staff engagement strategy, dive into our list\nof employee satisfaction and engagement statistics.\n\n##  **Key** **Job Satisfaction Statistics** ** - Editor\u2019s Pick**\n\n  * 72% of surveyed professionals say having more work benefits would increase their job satisfaction.\n  * 51% of US workers say they get a sense of identity from their job.\n  * 13% of employed Americans are actively disengaged at work.\n  * 30% of American workers say their job is \u201cjust a job to get them by.\u201d\n  * Only 46% of employees place \u201ca great deal of trust\u201din their employers.\n  * Employees who feel their superiors treat them with respect are 63% more satisfied with their jobs.\n  * 79% of American workers say company culture is an important factor in job satisfaction.\n  * 83% of millennials consider work-life balance to be the most important factor in evaluating a potential job.\n\n### Job Satisfaction Stats\n\n#### 1\\. Employees who feel their superiors treat them with respect are 63%\nmore satisfied with their jobs.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nEmployers who treat their workers respectfully have much to gain and nothing\nto lose. As a recent Harvard Business Review report confirms, when employees\nare respected by their leaders, their job satisfaction levels go up by as much\nas 63%. This, in turn, creates a 55% spike in engagement, while employees\u2019\nfocus heightens by 58%. This work satisfaction report also shows that\nappreciated employees are 110% more likely to stay with their organization.\n\n#### 2\\. 62% of employees in managerial positions report high job satisfaction\nlevels.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nEven though a management role entails a lot of responsibility and is often\nstressful, it comes with a set of perks that make up for it. Top-notch\nhealthcare, paid time off, a retirement savings plan, maternity/paternity\nleave, and professional development programs are some of the core benefits\nthat compensate for the stress and create good work-life balance. Pew\nResearch\u2019s job satisfaction statistics confirm that executives are\nparticularly likely to say they\u2019re \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their jobs, compared\nwith only 48% of those who work in manual or physical labor jobs.\n\n#### 3\\. 72% of surveyed professionals say having more work benefits would\nincrease their job satisfaction.\n\n(Zoro)\n\nThe majority of employees feel that additional benefits would improve their\noverall job satisfaction. Medical insurance paid fully by the company is\ndesired but not received by 58% of respondents, as is fully company-paid\ndental insurance (53%). Employee motivation statistics reveal that other perks\nworkers desire but don\u2019t get include work-from-home/remote days (40%),\nperformance bonuses (35%), transportation allowance (32%), catered meals\n(31%), and student loan reimbursement (29%).\n\n#### 4\\. 61% of employees with an annual family income of less than $30,000\nsay they are \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their family lives, compared with 80% of\nworkers whose family income is $75,000 per year or more.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the perks that matter. A study conducted by Pew Research\nCenter on 5,000 working American adults from all 50 states shows that a higher\nincome is directly related to overall satisfaction and happiness in terms of\nboth professional and family life. Happiness and productivity at work\nstatistics show that eight in 10 adults living in high-income households (with\nan annual income of $75,000 or more) reported being \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with\ntheir family lives, whereas only six in 10 adults from low-income families\n(with an annual income of $30,000 or less) reported the same level of\nsatisfaction.\n\n#### 5\\. 51% of US workers say they get a sense of identity from their job.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nAmericans are divided on whether their job is merely a source of income or a\nmore meaningful aspect of their lives that gives them a sense of identity. The\nsame job satisfaction in the US study indicates a little over half of working\nAmericans find purpose in their work. Another 47% of US employees say their\njob is just what they do for a living, while the remaining 2% hold multiple\njobs and did not answer this question.\n\n#### 6\\. 70% of adults working in education say their job gives them a sense\nof identity.\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nSome jobs are just more fulfilling than others. According to career\nsatisfaction statistics, most educators (70%) think their work makes them who\nthey are. Healthcare workers feel the same way, with 62% of them saying their\njob gives them a sense of identity. On the other hand, only 42% of people\nworking in hospitality and just 36% in the retail or wholesale trade identify\nwith their job.\n\n#### 7\\. 79% of American workers say company culture is an important job\nsatisfaction factor.\n\n(Speakap)\n\nWhen asked whether company culture is important to them, almost 80% of US\nprofessionals responded in the affirmative. Not only that: 57% said they would\ntake a job with a competitor if they felt that company\u2019s corporate culture\nwere better than their current company\u2019s. According to Speakap\u2019s company\nculture statistics, respect and fairness, trust and integrity, and teamwork\nare the most important attributes of a strong culture.\n\n#### 8\\. More than 50% of CEOs say corporate culture influences productivity,\ncreativity, profitability, company value, and growth rate.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nAnd while eight in 10 employees consider company culture vital to workplace\nengagement, only five in 10 top managers recognize this. Recruit Loop reveals\nthat a little over half of CEOs surveyed admit the effects of corporate\nculture on how productive and creative workers are, how much revenue the\ncompany generates, and how quickly it grows.\n\n#### 9\\. 58% of US managers say they haven\u2019t received any management training.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nPerhaps the discrepancy between the percentage of workers and executives who\nunderstand the relevance of corporate culture can be accounted for by this\nshocking stat. CareerBuilder\u2019s nationwide survey conducted on 2,480 US\nemployers and 3,910 US workers reveals that nearly 60% of managers get into\nleadership positions without receiving any training for the task. According to\nthese HR statistics, the biggest challenges executives name are dealing with\nissues between co-workers on their team, motivating team members, performance\nreviews, and creating career paths for employees. Basically, all the tasks\nthey find daunting reflect their lack of managerial training.\n\n#### 10\\. 23% of employees describe their leaders\u2019 performance as \u201cpoor\u201d or\n\u201cvery poor.\u201d\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same study found that almost a quarter of US workers rate\ntheir corporate leaders\u2019 performance as \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cvery poor.\u201d CareerBuilder\u2019s\njob satisfaction statistics further explain that employees who are unsatisfied\nwith their superiors think they don\u2019t make an effort to listen to employees or\naddress employee morale. Employees also cite a lack of transparency and honest\ncommunication, major changes made without warning, unreasonable workloads, and\nimpossible productivity demands as reasons for their poor evaluation.\n\n#### 11\\. 30% of American workers say their job is \u201cjust a job to get them\nby.\u201d\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nNearly a third of employed adults in the US work just because they have to.\nThey consider their job neither a career nor a stepping stone to one. Luckily,\nthe number of devoted workers who believe they are on the right path is\nhigher, with 50% of respondents saying they view their job as a career.\nAnother 20% of Americans believe their current job is the starting point that\nwill lead to a career, according to recently published employment satisfaction\nstatistics.\n\n#### 12\\. Only 25% of employees who quit their jobs cite money as the main\nreason for leaving.\n\n(Officevibe)\n\nEven though most employers are blissfully oblivious, with 89% of them thinking\nworkers leave for financial reasons, in reality only 25% of employees abandon\ntheir jobs because of unsatisfactory pay. In fact, it\u2019s usually the employer\nwho chases people away. Officevibe\u2019s turnover statistics show that 75% of\npeople who end up leaving don\u2019t quit their job; they quit their boss.\n\n#### 13\\. Women (44%) are more likely than men (39%) to leave their current\njob for a new one with a flexible work environment.\n\n(Globe Newswire)\n\nWomen, who often need to juggle various responsibilities both at home and in\nthe office, are more interested in a flexible work environment than men.\nAlmost half of female respondents said they would quit their job to go work\nfor a company that permits them to work from home occasionally, with flexible\nworking hours. Men were less interested in this perk - only 39% of them would\njump ship for this reason.\n\n#### 14\\. Men (40%) are more likely to leave their current job for a higher\nposition in a different company than women (30%).\n\n(Globe Newswire)\n\nBetter-ranking positions tend to motivate men more than flexibility. Yoh\u2019s\nworkplace statistics show that male employees often change jobs because of the\nprestige and power associated with executive roles. Their female counterparts\nare less inclined to switch work environments for a high-status position.\n\n#### 15\\. 83% of millennials consider work-life balance to be the most\nimportant factor in evaluating a potential job.\n\n(FlexJobs)\n\nAchieving work-life balance is a priority for a handsome majority of\nmillenials. A whopping 83% of people born between the early eighties and mid-\nnineties assess a potential job on how time-consuming it will be. If they\njudge it will leave little to no free time, millennials won\u2019t accept such a\nposition, as we can see from a range of job satisfaction statistics. When it\ncomes to baby boomers, though, only 62% consider work-life balance a factor\nwhen deciding whether or not to take on a new role.\n\n#### 16\\. More than three-quarters of employees would not accept a better-paid\njob from a company that failed to act against employees who were involved in\nsexual harassment.\n\n(The Manifest)\n\nMore money would not be incentive enough to attract professionals to a company\nwith unethical practices. A 2019 study published by The Manifest shows that\n79% of employees wouldn\u2019t come to work in a firm that neglects to act on\nsexual harassment accusations. Other intolerable practices, as reported in\nthese retention stats, include selling users\u2019 data without their knowledge\n(76%), creating environmental problems (72%), and paying female or minority-\nbackground employees less (71%).\n\n#### 17\\. Workers who say their company provides equal opportunities are\nalmost four times more likely to be proud to work for the company.\n\n(Salesforce)\n\nCreating a workplace where everyone\u2019s voice is heard and all have the same\nchance of getting ahead exclusively based on merit is an excellent way of\nmotivating employees. Working for an equal-opportunity company makes staff 3.8\ntimes more likely to feel proud of their employer and team.\n\n#### 18\\. 42% of employed Americans would change jobs for another that offers\nthe possibility of working remotely, but only 24% would switch jobs for a\nshorter commute.\n\n(Global Newswire)\n\nWork place statistics let know that US employees deem remote work possibility\nmore important than short commute when considering a job change. If offered a\nposition in a different company that would allow them to get things done\nwithout coming into the office, 42% of employed Americans would accept it. A\njob closer to home with reduced commute time would motivate only a quarter of\nUS employees to leave their current job.\n\n#### 19\\. Only 46% of workers have \u201ca great deal of trust\u201d in their bosses.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nA global study that included 9,800 full-time workers aged 19 to 68 from eight\ncountries shows only 46% of workers trust their employers greatly. According\nto Harvard Business Review employee loyalty statistics, 39% of surveyed\nemployees say they have \u201csome trust,\u201d while 15% report \u201cvery little\u201d or \u201cno\ntrust at all.\u201d Employers who want to improve engagement and retention should\nkeep in mind that people believe a high level of trust in their company has a\nmajor influence on them being happier at work, staying at the company, doing\nhigher-quality work, and recommending the company to others.\n\n#### 20\\. 66% of Gen Z workers consider equal opportunity for pay and\npromotion as \u201dvery important\u201d factors that would influence their trust in an\nemployer.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nTo earn the trust of Generation Z, companies need to implement fair practices.\nEmployee satisfaction statistics indicate that two-thirds of employees just\nentering the workforce consider equal advancement opportunities and merit-\nbased salaries \u201cvery important\u201d factors in shaping how much they trust their\nemployer. Learning and advancement opportunities are also very important for\n66% of young workers when deciding whether to trust their companies.\n\n#### 21\\. More than two in five workers have gained weight at their current\njob.\n\n(PR Newswire)\n\nCareer Vision\u2019s corporate wellness statistics reveal that 56% of the nation's\nworkforce believe they are overweight, and 45% believe they've gained weight\nat their present job. When asked what contributed to their weight gain, 51%\nsaid sitting at a desk most of the day, 45% said they were too exhausted from\nwork to exercise, and 38% blamed stress-eating.\n\n#### 22\\. 28% of employees say their company provides gym passes, workout\nfacilities, or wellness benefits, but 63% of employees from this group don't\ntake advantage of those perks.\n\n(PR Newswire)\n\nEmployee engagement statistics indicate that more than a quarter of companies\ntry to keep their workers happy and healthy by providing workout passes.\nDespite this, 63% of people who have access to these wellness benefits do not\nuse them. On the other hand, 64% of workers say their employers do not offer\nsuch perks, but if offered, 42% think they would take advantage of them.\n\n#### 23\\. With a job satisfaction score of 4.6 out of 5, recruiting managers\nreport the highest job satisfaction levels.\n\n(Glasdoor)\n\nA job satisfaction by profession study published by Glassdoor in 2019 reveals\nthat recruiting managers, with a median base salary of $70,000, tend to be\nhappiest at work. Second place is shared by three professions: dental\nhygienists, who make $67,250 annually, sales operations managers ($93,000 per\nyear), and product designers ($100,000 per year). All of these jobs have\nsatisfaction levels of 4.5 out of 5. This data shows that, while money is\nimportant, it isn\u2019t the decisive factor in determining how one feels about\ntheir job.\n\n#### 24\\. 75% of US professionals think new technology is contributing to\ntheir job dissatisfaction.\n\n(The Economic Times)\n\nAs many as three-quarters of American workers believe new technology causes\ndissatisfaction at work, only 20% say tech innovation and new gadgets are\nresponsible for raising their job satisfaction, while 5% are indifferent.\nThese employee dissatisfaction statistics reveal that fear of immediate job\nloss, concern about fewer jobs in the future, and poor workplace ethics are\nthe main reasons for this dissatisfaction.\n\n### Employee Engagement Stats\n\n#### 25\\. Only 34% of US employees are engaged at work.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nBut according to Gallup\u2019s latest employee engagement statistics, the\npercentage of workers who are passionate about their job and feel committed to\ntheir work and their workplace is actually at an all-time high. The American\nanalytics agency started conducting a yearly survey on employee engagement in\n2000. In the nearly two decades since, the percentage of actively disengaged\nworkers has never been lower, either. Employees who feel miserable about their\nwork environment currently make up only 13% of the American workforce.\n\n#### 26\\. 91% of highly engaged employees report being satisfied with their\nprofessional development opportunities.\n\n(Bonusly)\n\nBut why is employee engagement important? Because it creates pleasant\nworkplaces people don\u2019t want to leave. When employees feel like valued team\nmembers whose contribution is recognized and appreciated, they are 87% less\nlikely to leave their job, according to Recruit Loop\u2019s retention statistics.\nThe bottom line is that it makes more sense, financial and otherwise, to\ninvest in keeping high-performance workers than to constantly spend money\nfinding and training new personnel.\n\n#### 27\\. Engaged teams generate 21% more profit than their disengaged\ncounterparts.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nWhen people are satisfied with their job, have good communication with their\nsuperiors and their colleagues, and set clear goals, they are motivated to\nachieve great results. And they often do. According to Gallup\u2019s engagement\nstatistics, teams that work in companies that nurture a high-engagement\nculture reward those companies with higher productivity, better customer\nengagement, better employee retention, and a 21% increase in profitability.\n\n#### 28\\. Employers who increase their workers\u2019 engagement by just 10% can\nboost profits by $2,400 per employee every year.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nRecruit Loop provides more detailed information on the financial rewards\nemployers can reap if they increase worker engagement. Raising staff morale\ncan also boost company profits. Getting employees to care just 10% more about\nthe work they do and their company can bring in $2,400 per employee each year,\naccording to these productivity stats.\n\n#### 29\\. Actively disengaged workers cost the US between $450 billion and\n$550 billion in lost productivity per year.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nKeeping severely disengaged workers - the ones who are so unhappy with their\njob they undermine the achievements of engaged employees on purpose - costs\nAmerican companies a hefty sum each year. In fact, Gallup estimates the\ncombined cost in lost productivity these workers cause amounts to $550 billion\nannually.\n\n#### 30\\. US companies spend $11 billion annually on employee turnover.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nStaff rotation costs are another huge financial burden relating to employee\nengagement. Finding ways to keep workers motivated and truly connected to the\ncompany will ensure they are loyal to their organization. Failing to do this,\nhowever, means constantly having to search for new employees and spending time\nand money training them. Bearing in mind recent employee turnover statistics\nthat reveal American companies allocate as much as $11 billion every year on\nreplacing staff, it\u2019s undoubtedly more profitable to retain existing workers.\n\n#### 31\\. 47% of HR chiefs cite employee retention and turnover as their top\nworkforce-management challenge.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nAs clear as it may be that employee retention is beneficial to any\norganization, HR leaders agree it is the biggest obstacle they encounter while\nmanaging personnel. Nearly half of HR specialists cite retention and turnover\nas the most challenging aspects of their job, followed by recruitment and\nculture management.\n\n#### 32\\. 96% of employees believe showing empathy is an important way of\nimproving employee retention.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nEmployers who care openly about their staff have an excellent shot at earning\ntheir workers\u2019 loyalty, according to Forbes\u2019 employee retention statistics.\nHuman capital is a company\u2019s most valuable asset, so why not show some human\ninterest in your workers? Celebrating important life moments, encouraging\nemployees to use vacation time, providing company gym passes - these are all\nways of showing the people who work for you that you care about them.\n\n#### 33\\. 70% of organizations have adopted values-based employee-recognition\nprograms.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nFostering employee engagement in an organization goes hand-in-hand with\nletting employees know their hard work is noticed and appreciated. Tying these\nrecognition programs with core values of a company is becoming notably popular\namong HR leaders. Why? Because values-based employee-recognition plans reward\nemployees while reinforcing and driving business goals at the same time.\n\n#### 34\\. Employee-recognition programs funded with at least 1% of payroll are\nmore likely to be rated successfully by HR managers than underfunded programs\nor programs with zero budget.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nWorkhuman\u2019s job satisfaction statistics emphasize the importance of investing\nin programs that make employees feel appreciated. HR experts agree that\nunderfunded employee recognition initiatives or initiatives with no budget at\nall give unsatisfactory results. A certain amount of funds - usually at least\n1% of payroll - need to be set aside for these programs to be effective.\n\n#### 35\\. Organizations with ethnically and gender-diverse staff are 21% to\n31% more likely to have financial returns above industry medians.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nWomen and minorities remain underrepresented in many workplaces despite the\nfact that diversity has been proven to improve businesses\u2019 performance. US job\nstatistics recently published by McKinsey bring to light just how big an\neffect diversity has on company revenue. Businesses that are in the top\nquartile for gender diversity are 21% more likely to exceed their industry\nmedian profits. In the case of ethnically diverse teams, the likelihood of\nexceeding median industry revenue goes up by 31%. It makes perfect sense; in\ndiverse teams everybody brings their own perspective to the table,\nstrengthening the company.\n\n#### 36\\. Empowering women and advancing their equality in the workplace could\nadd $12 trillion to the global GDP by 2025.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nMcKinsley\u2019s productivity statistics point to the enormous power of inclusion.\nWorking towards empowering women and engaging them in the workforce around the\nworld would be extremely beneficial to everyone. To put it in financial terms,\nthe global GDP would increase by mind-boggling $12 trillion in the next six\nyears if this goal were achieved.\n\n#### 37\\. A great onboarding experience can lock down 69% of employees for at\nleast three years.\n\n(O.C. Tanner)\n\nOnboarding is the employer\u2019s first chance to shape an engaged worker.\nSuccessfully communicating the company mission, setting clear goals and\nexpectations, providing adequate training and mentorship, and checking in on\neach new employee\u2019s progress are some of the most important ways to retain\nstaff. Employee engagement and retention begin on day one. If done properly,\nthese initial actions can ensure the majority of workers stay with the\norganization for a minimum of three years.\n\n#### 38\\. Up to 20% of employee turnover happens within the first 45 days on\nthe job.\n\n(O.C Tanner)\n\nJust as effective onboarding has the power to lock down new hires for years, a\nmishandled onboarding process can drive new employees away in just 45 days. As\nO.C. Tanner\u2019s employee retention stats show, a fifth of all employee churn\nhappens during this short period of time. Deploying the previously mentioned\ntechniques reduces the likelihood of employee walkout, both at the beginning\nof employment and later on.\n\n#### 39\\. 60% of employers don\u2019t set clear goals for new hires in their first\nyear.\n\n(O.C Tanner)\n\nAlmost two-thirds of employers make the huge mistake of not determining well-\ndefined goals for new hires during their first year on the job. Even though it\nmay seem sensible not to put too much pressure on new team members and give\nthem time to learn the ropes, it is detrimental for the organization not to\nset clear targets for the first year on the job. According to employee\nengagement data, if workers don\u2019t see management taking interest in their\nresults, monitoring them, and providing constructive feedback, they can easily\nbecome disengaged.\n\n#### 40\\. 86% of both employees and executives cite a lack of collaboration\nand ineffective communication as the main reason for workplace failures.\n\n(Recruit Loop)\n\nEmployees and their bosses are on the same page when it comes to pinning down\nthe reasons for workplace failures. The large majority of all workers think\nclearer communication and more collaboration would lead to better results, but\nonly 18% of employees are evaluated on communication in their performance\nreviews.\n\n#### 41\\. When employees take part in special projects, they are 50% more\nlikely to learn new and valuable skills that help with their current roles.\n\n(O.C. Tanner)\n\nO.C. Tanner\u2019s recently published employee development statistics point to the\nimportance of involving employees in projects that go beyond their everyday\ntasks. Constantly focusing on just a few assignments kills workers\u2019\nmotivation. So, when a new project arises, make sure to include not just the\nemployees who can contribute, but also those who can learn from it.\n\n#### 42\\. For every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-\nexecutive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) go up by 0.8%.\n\n(McKinsey)\n\nPeople from different backgrounds have different perspectives. Thanks to their\nunique set of previous experiences, they view problems from a range of angles\nand come up with different solutions. When people with different outlooks\nbounce ideas off of each other, they think of better solutions than like-\nminded people from the same culture. As McKinsey\u2019s employee engagement\nstatistics show, executive teams composed of ethnically and racially diverse\nmembers generate higher earnings.\n\n#### 43\\. Nine in 10 HR leaders agree that ongoing peer feedback and check-ins\nhave a positive impact on their organizations.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nRegularly checking in on employees\u2019 progress, results and issues they face\nhelps organizations a great deal. This practice gives managers a chance to\nguide workers in the right direction at the right time. Instead of employees\nfeeling stuck and abandoned with a task, regular check-ins ensure problems are\ntackled by both the staff and their leaders. This system, paired with ongoing\npeer feedback, is among the top employee engagement and retention strategies\nof 89% of HR experts.\n\n#### 44\\. 80% of HR managers say there is an employee-recognition program in\ntheir organizations.\n\n(Workhuman)\n\nHR managers agree that their employee-recognition programs contribute to a\npositive employee experience (89%), good employee relationships (86%),\norganizational culture (85%), employee engagement (84%), and organizational\nvalues (83%). Keeping in mind all these benefits, HR leaders recommend\ntreating employee recognition as more than just a program. They believe it\nshould be a management practice with a real and measurable business impact,\naccording to Workhuman\u2019s HR and employee engagement statistics.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### What is job satisfaction?\n\nJob satisfaction, as the name indicates, refers to the level of fulfilment an\nemployee gets from their job and work environment. When workers are satisfied,\nthey are self-motivated, content, and productive. They show up to work ready\nto face new challenges. Companies whose workers feel highly satisfied with\ntheir job outperform their competition. Innovation and great results happen\nwhen workers feel respected and valued at work.\n\n#### How to keep employees engaged?\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to employee engagement. Clearly defined\ngoals and expectations, ongoing feedback from peers and superiors alike, open\ncommunication, employee recognition programs, internal career development\nprograms, competitive benefits, positive corporate culture, and flexible work\nenvironment are among the best employment engagement strategies.\n\n#### Why employees quit statistics?\n\nPeople quit for various reasons, but according to 2019 data from Statista, a\nquarter of Americans cite better pay as the main reason for leaving a company.\nThe second-most common reason is dissatisfaction with their current\norganization (16%), followed by workers who are looking for companies with\nvalues more similar to their own (14%). Relocation (11%) and changing part-\ntime gigs for full-time jobs round up the top-five list of reasons why US\nworkers change employers.\n\n#### What percentage of employees are engaged?\n\nThe latest statistics on employee engagement published by Gallup in 2018 show\nthat the percentage of engaged workers has never been higher. But with only\n34% of workers describing themselves as engaged, there\u2019s still a long way to\ngo before America reaches its full productivity and engagement potential.\n\n#### How many employees are disengaged?\n\nWhile a little over a third of employed Americans identify as \u201cactively\nengaged\u201d at work, 53% of them say they are \u2018not engaged\u2019. Workers from this\ngroup are generally satisfied with their job but say they lack an emotional\nand cognitive connection with their work environment. Employee disengagement\nstatistics show that 13% of workers are \u201cactively disengaged,\u201d meaning they\nare very discontent with their job, so much so they actively undercut the work\ntheir engaged coworkers do.\n\n#### What are the benefits of employee engagement?\n\nThe benefits flow thick and fast when for both workers and corporations when\nstaff members are engaged. Appreciating the human capital of a company leads\nto higher job satisfaction rates as well as improved employment retention\nrates. When employees are engaged at work they tend to have fewer accidents\nand miss work less. Engaged personnel generate more revenue, provide better\ncustomer service, makes more sales, and create more profitable organizations.\nAlso, engaged and satisfied employees achieve a better work-life balance and\nare healthier.\n\n#### How many people like their job?\n\nRelying on the latest data from Statista and Gallup, we\u2019ve calculated that\nthere are approximately 44.5 million full-time workers in the US who love\ntheir job. According to a Statista report published in June 2019, the number\nof full-time workers in the US amounts to 131 million. Gallup\u2019s latest annual\nsurvey suggests 34% of working Americans are fully engaged - happy and\ncommitted - at work. Therefore, the number of people who love their job is a\nlittle over 44.5 million.\n\n#### How many Americans hate their job?\n\nBasing our estimates on the previously mentioned statistics about jobs, we\nreached a number of some 17 million US employees who hate their job. Let\u2019s\nconsider that the 13% of actively disengaged workers from Gallup\u2019s yearly\nemployee engagement study hate their job. From that, we calculated 13% of\nStatista\u2019s data on the number of US employees who hold full-time positions.\nAccording to this data, more than 17 million Americans are miserable at work.\n\n### Happy Employees = Productive Company\n\nAs our list of job satisfaction statistics reiterates, companies do very well\nwhen their employees are happy at work. Engaged employees are likely to feel\ngreat about their job, achieve better results, have a good work-life balance,\nand feel appreciated. All these positive feelings they generate spill over\ninto the company\u2019s performance, resulting in higher productivity and more\nrevenue.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already doing so, you should start expressing appreciation for\nyour employees immediately. After all, they are your business\u2019s most valuable\nasset.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n  1.

Johnson has been the CEO of Starbucks Corporation\n([NASDAQ:SBUX](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-\nsbux/starbucks?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=995912))\nsince 2017. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in\ncomparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. After that, we will\nconsider the growth in the business. And finally we will reflect on how common\nstockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of\nperformance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay\nlevels.\n\n[ View our latest analysis for Starbucks\n](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-\nsbux/starbucks?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=995912)\n\n### How Does Kevin Johnson's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized\nCompanies?\n\nOur data indicates that Starbucks Corporation is worth US$104b, and total\nannual CEO compensation was reported as US$13m for the year to September 2018.\nWhile this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the\nsalary is lower, valued at US$1.5m. We further remind readers that the CEO may\nface performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total\ncompensation. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over\nUS$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$11m. Once\nyou start looking at very large companies, you need to take a broader range,\nbecause there simply aren't that many of them.\n\nSo Kevin Johnson is paid around the average of the companies we looked at.\nThis doesn't tell us a whole lot on its own, but looking at the performance of\nthe actual business will give us useful context.\n\nYou can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Starbucks,\nbelow.\n\n[![NasdaqGS:SBUX CEO Compensation, January 8th\n2020](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![NasdaqGS:SBUX CEO\nCompensation, January 8th\n2020](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eeAf4ZhUf8R7oaZR10nU8w--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/ce833f5b1d6add38e73c35d79f7d9b33)NasdaqGS:SBUX\nCEO Compensation, January 8th\n2020More](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-\nsbux/starbucks?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=995912#ceo_salary)\n\n### Is Starbucks Corporation Growing?\n\nOn average over the last three years, Starbucks Corporation has grown earnings\nper share (EPS) by 13% each year (using a line of best fit). It achieved\nrevenue growth of 7.3% over the last year.\n\nOverall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company\nhas improved in recent years. It's also good to see modest revenue growth,\nsuggesting the underlying business is healthy. Shareholders might be\ninterested in [this **free** visualization of analyst\nforecasts.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-\nsbux/starbucks?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-\npitch&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=995912#past)\n\n### Has Starbucks Corporation Been A Good Investment?\n\nI think that the total shareholder return of 61%, over three years, would\nleave most Starbucks Corporation shareholders smiling. This strong performance\nmight mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than\nis normal for a company of its size.\n\n### In Summary...\n\nKevin Johnson is paid around the same as most CEOs of large companies.\n\nFew would be critical of the leadership, since returns have been juicy and\nearnings per share are moving in the right direction. Indeed, many might\nconsider the pay rather modest, given the solid company performance! If you\nthink CEO compensation levels are interesting you will probably really like\n[this free visualization of insider trading at\nStarbucks.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-\nsbux/starbucks?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=995912#insider_trading)\n\nIf you want to buy a stock that is better than Starbucks, this **free** [list\nof high return, low debt companies is a great place to\nlook.](https://simplywall.st/user/views/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-\ndebt?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion-\ngrid&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=995912)\n\n _If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor\nat[editorial-team@simplywallst.com](mailto:editorial-\nteam@simplywallst.com?subject=Re%3A%20Your%20article%20on%20NasdaqGS%3ASBUX%20\\(yahoo\\)%20from%208th%20January%202020).\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

AM\n\n###\n\n![BT_20190207_ULTIMATE_3688728.jpg](/sites/default/files/styles/article_img/public/image/2019/02/07/BT_20190207_ULTIMATE_3688728.jpg?itok=FlMtmtHO)\n\nUltimate Software manages employee relationships from recruiting to\nretirement.\n\nPHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nNew York\n\nULTIMATE Software Group said it agreed to be acquired by an investor group led\nby Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners in a deal valued at about US$11\nbillion.\n\nShareholders of Ultimate Software, which makes cloud-based human resources\nmanagement software, will receive US$331.50 per share in cash, the company\nsaid in a statement Monday. The terms represent a premium of about 32 per cent\nover the company's average stock price during the 30 days up to Feb 1.\nUltimate shares rose 20 per cent in New York trading.\n\nWeston, Florida-based Ultimate Software was founded in 1990 by Scott Scherr,\nwho will remain at the company along with the existing senior management team.\nUltimate Software manages employee relationships from recruiting to\nretirement. While starting with a basic package to manage payroll and\nbenefits, Ultimate expands its offerings, sold on a subscription basis per\nemployee, to include analytics tools that track a full range of human\nresources. Its customers include Subway Restaurants and Red Roof Inns Inc.\n\nPayroll and human resources software \"is a very attractive space to invest\nin\", Jefferies analyst Samad Samana said. \"It has very attractive\ncharacteristics - high retention rates. Everybody needs payroll, so it's a\nvery large market.\"\n\n[\n\n### SEE ALSO\n\n## Ultimate Software agrees to US$11b buyout by investor group\n\n](/companies-markets/ultimate-software-agrees-to-us11b-buyout-by-investor-\ngroup)\n\n#### Stay updated with  \nBT newsletters\n\n[Terms & conditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)\n\nSign up\n\nSeveral analysts have recently taken note of the company. Deutsche Bank\nanalyst Michael Turrin initiated coverage of the company last week with a buy\nrating, calling it a top \"value\" pick, based on its early transition to the\ncloud and a strong workplace culture. Mr Turrin said the company has proven\nitself capable of delivering consistent 20 per cent-plus recurring revenue\ngrowth and operating margin.\n\nUltimate Software was ranked No 1 on Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology\nlist for the fourth consecutive year. Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of the\ncompany last week with a neutral rating on the stock.\n\nMr Samana said he wouldn't be surprised to see another company potentially\nmake a bid for Ultimate Software. \"The difference for a strategic buyer is\nthere could be potential revenue and cost synergies that would make the deal\nmore valuable for them than for a private equity buyer,\" Mr Samana said.\n\nDeal activity among software companies, including payroll, should continue\nbecause of the amount of money that can be put to work, according to Mr\nSamana. Large enterprise software companies have extra cash due to the new tax\nlaw, Mr Samana said, adding that private equity firms have also raised a lot\nof capital and are increasingly finding value in software.\n\nUltimate Software is the second-fastest growing provider, behind Workday Inc,\nin the US$17 billion human-capital management and payroll-software market.\nIt's moving beyond a core of mid-sized customers and has been gaining market\nshare, while its acquisition of PeopleDoc should help it expand\ninternationally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh.\n\nCorporations' increasing preference for cloud-based human capital management\nand payroll software should help Ultimate Software expand faster than large,\nlegacy peers such as SAP SE, Oracle Corp and ADP.\n\nThe deal with Hellman will help Ultimate make additional investments in\nproducts and services, as well as rewarding employees, the company said.\n\nHellman & Friedman is a private equity fund that makes large-market buyout\ninvestments in the communications, consumer discretionary, financials, health\ncare, industrials, and technology sectors. Other investors include Blackstone\nGroup, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and JMI Equity.

Under guidelines laid out in the bill, which is now with the\nstate senate, ride-hail drivers would likely fail the contractor test because\nthey don\u2019t perform work \u201coutside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s\nbusiness.\u201d Put another way, drivers drive, and driving is essential to Uber\nand Lyft.\n\nOn June 12, Uber\u2019s and Lyft\u2019s top executives took the extraordinary step of\nco-authoring an [op-ed in the San Francisco\nChronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Open-Forum-\nUber-Lyft-ready-to-do-our-part-for-13969843.php) that pushes back on the bill\nand promises to improve work quality and job security for their drivers. The\nrare public alliance between Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Lyft co-founders\nLogan Green and John Zimmer, whose companies are bitter rivals in the US, is\nthe clearest sign of how seriously these companies are taking the legislative\nthreat.\n\nUber\u2019s and Lyft\u2019s businesses, valued together at nearly $100 billion by the\npublic markets, depend entirely on the view that their drivers are independent\ncontractors and not employees. Why? Employees are expensive\u2014for loss-making\nUber and Lyft, perhaps prohibitively so. Employees are protected by federal\nand local minimum wage laws. They also get health care benefits, and their\nemployers pay various taxes toward social security, unemployment, and other\nsocial services.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if drivers were employees they could form a union and bargain\ncollectively. They would likely have less flexibility with their schedules,\nand be less able to work for multiple platforms, as many now do. For now,\nthough, let\u2019s focus just on the costs for the companies.\n\nIn a report earlier this week, equity research analysts at Barclays estimated\nthat reclassifying workers could cost Uber and Lyft an additional $3,625 per\ndriver in California. That\u2019s enough to boost Uber\u2019s annual operating loss by\nmore than $500 million and Lyft\u2019s by $290 million. \u201cAny wide-scale\nreclassification of drivers to employees would be a material negative for\nride-hailing and further put into question the long term profitability of the\nindustry,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down. First, Barclays looked at the additional payroll taxes\nand training costs Uber and Lyft would have to pay if their drivers became\nemployees. Barclays based its estimates on a part-time driver who averages\n$15,600 a year in ride-hail income ($20 an hour for 15 hours a week, 52 weeks\na year).\n\nReclassification cost| Uber| Lyft  \n---|---|---  \nFICA| $967| $967  \nMedicare| 226| 226  \nFUTA (federal unemployment)| 147| 147  \nSUTA (state unemployment)| 238| 238  \nTraining| 7| 7  \nTotal per employee| 1,585| 1,585  \n  \nBarclays estimates Uber has 140,000 drivers in California and Lyft 80,000.\nThat implies that Uber would owe about $222 million in payroll taxes and\ntraining costs each year, and Lyft $127 million, if drivers were considered\nemployees.\n\nNext, Barclays broke out costs related to California workers compensation\ninsurance, which employers in the state are [legally\nrequired](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/Employer.htm) to provide. At a midpoint\nrate for the taxi and limousine industry, Barclays estimates both Uber and\nLyft are looking at another $2,040 per employee per year, which works out to\nabout $286 million and $163 million for all drivers each company has in the\nstate, respectively.\n\nAdd the payroll taxes to the worker comp cost, and you get a total annual\nemployee-related cost of about $508 million for Uber and $290 million for\nLyft, or $3,625 per driver.\n\nSuch costs would be a significant hit to both companies. Uber reported an\noperating loss of $1 billion in the [first quarter of\n2019](https://qz.com/1631822/uber-reports-first-quarter-results-that-are-\nconfusing-by-design/). Barclays expects the company to post an operating loss\nof $3.9 billion for the full year, 30% more than the $3 billion loss in 2018.\nIf drivers were to become employees in California, Barclays thinks that Uber\u2019s\n2019 operating loss would widen to $4.4 billion.\n\nThe relative impact is even worse for Lyft, which operates only in the US and\ntherefore has more risk concentrated in California. As things stand, Barclays\nexpects Lyft to lose $1.2 billion in 2019, versus a loss of $980 million the\nyear before. If drivers were to become employees, however, Barclays thinks\nthat loss could climb to $1.5 billion this year.\n\nBoth\n[Uber](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519120759/d647752ds1a.htm#toc)\nand\n[Lyft](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759509/000119312519059849/d633517ds1.htm#toc633517_11)\nwarned in their investor prospectuses before going public that their\nbusinesses would be adversely affected if drivers were classified as employees\ninstead of independent contractors. Uber noted such a change would lead to\n\u201csignificant additional expenses\u201d\u2014potentially including minimum wage,\novertime, meal and rest period requirements, employee benefits, payroll taxes,\nand social security contributions\u2014and \u201crequire us to fundamentally change our\nbusiness model.\u201d Lyft cautioned that it may need to \u201crevise our pricing\nmethodologies to account for such a change to driver classification.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if drivers are deemed employees in the state of California,\nthe companies will probably pass some of the cost onto customers by making\nrides more expensive.\n\n[![Quartz Daily Brief](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n[\n\n##### Quartz Daily Brief\n\n](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n##### Subscribe to the Daily Brief, our morning email with news and insights\nyou need to understand our changing world.\n\nSign me up\n\n[Technology](/re/technology/), [Business](/re/business/), [Uber](/re/uber/),\n[startups](/re/startups-2/), [Employment](/re/employment/)\n\n[\ud83d\udcac\\+ Add your insights](/co/2495755/)\n\n[](mailto:?subject=Quartz%3A%20How%20much%20it%20would%20cost%20Uber%20and%20Lyft%20if%20drivers%20were%20employees&body=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1643263%2Fthe-\ncost-to-uber-and-lyft-if-drivers-were-\nemployees%2F%0A%0AA%20bill%20passed%20by%20the%20California%20Assembly%20seems%20likely%20to%20classify%20Uber%20and%20Lyft%20drivers%20as%20employees%2C%20and%20it%20could%20cost%20the%20companies%20big.%0A%0ASign%20up%20for%20the%20Quartz%20Daily%20Brief%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Fdaily-\nbrief \"Share via\nemail\")[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1643263%2Fthe-\ncost-to-uber-and-lyft-if-drivers-were-\nemployees%2F&caption=qz.com%20%7C%20By%20Alison%20Griswold \"Share via\nfacebook\")[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1643263%2F&text=How%20much%20it%20would%20cost%20Uber%20and%20Lyft%20if%20drivers%20were%20employees&via=qz\n\"Share via twitter\")\n\n[](/)\n\nNews for the next era, not the next hour\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\nDiscover\n\n  * [Membership](/become-a-member/)\n  * [Emails](/emails/)\n  * [Latest](/latest/)\n  * [Popular](/popular/)\n  * [Featured](/featured/)\n  * [Obsessions](/obsessions/)\n\nTopics\n\n  * [Emerging industries](/topic/emerging-industries/)\n  * [Economics](/topic/finance-and-economics/)\n  * [Lifestyle](/topic/lifestyle/)\n  * [Politics](/topic/politics-and-policy/)\n  * [Science](/topic/science-and-human-behavior/)\n  * [Tech](/topic/tech-and-communications/)\n  * [Work](/topic/work-and-management/)\n\nMore\n\n  * [Search](/search/)\n  * [Careers](/careers/)\n  * [About us](/about/)\n  * [Contact us](/about/#contact)\n  * [Help center](https://help.qz.com/en/)\n  * [Send us tips](/tips/)\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\n[Download our app](/app/?pid=socialshare&af_dp=zebroid%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ffooter)\n\n  * [Site map](/sitemap/)\n  * [Terms & conditions](/about/terms-conditions/)\n  * [Privacy policy](/about/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Do not sell my info](/about/do-not-sell/)\n  * [Ethics and advertising agreements](/about/ethicsandadvertisingguidelines/)\n  * [Community agreements](/about/community-agreements/)\n\nQuartz is owned by [Uzabase](https://www.uzabase.com/en/), the business\nintelligence and media company. \u00a9 2020 Quartz Media, Inc.

Since\nits inception, the fund has averaged 16.18% per year.\n\nOn a shorter timeline, things aren't quite as competitive. Through the past\nfive years, the fund averaged 8.8% per year, versus 11.7% from the S&P.\nOverall, though, I like the fund because I think the healthcare sector is a\ngood long-term play. The aging population will only require more medical care,\nand the sector as a whole stands to benefit.\n\n![The words mutual funds are drawn at the top of a notebook of graph paper. A\nhighlighter rests on top of a hand-drawn chart. Next to the notebook are\nglasses and stacks of sticky notes.\n](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F553625%2Fgettyimages-508546190.jpg&w=700)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSome investors may worry about the ramifications of any federal reforms to the\nU.S. healthcare system. But I think those fears are overblown, given that we\nhaven't seen any meaningful changes to the system regardless of who's in power\nin Washington. I view healthcare as more recession-proof than other industries\nand therefore think this mutual fund is a great play.\n\n## 2\\. Software, IT, and tech\n\nInformation technology and software are here to stay, and the **Fidelity\nSelect Software & IT Services Portfolio** (NASDAQMUTFUND: FSCSX) fund has done\nincredibly well in outperforming the market since the fund's inception. By\ninvesting in the likes of **Microsoft** , **Visa** , **Adobe** , and\n**salesforce.com** , the fund has had a 38.87% run over a one-year period,\nversus the S&P 500's 31.49% spurt. Since its inception in 1985, the fund has\naveraged 16.24% per year, outpacing the S&P's 10.79%. Even in poor recent\nyears for the market, such as 2015, this mutual fund managed 10.31% growth.\nAnd even with tax-adjusted returns, the fund has averaged 23.42% over a three-\nyear period. **Morningstar** gives the mutual fund a five-star rating, with\nbelow-average risk for the category.\n\n## 3\\. A dividend-focused fund for income investors\n\nThe **T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund** (NASDAQMUTFUND: PRFDX) aims to invest\nin undervalued equities with consistent dividend yields. Since its inception,\nthe fund has kept relative pace with the S&P 500. Over the shorter term,\nhowever, it has lagged the market somewhat as large growth ruled the day.\n\nI include the name as a play on the potential shift back to value as investors\nconstantly attempt to calculate the likelihood of a pullback or recession on\nthe horizon. Holdings are 23.91% invested in financials, with names including\n**Wells Fargo** and **JPMorgan Chase** , as well as **Verizon** and\n**Boeing**.\n\nThis year has been a slow one. But an emphasis on value and dividends is\nsomething that belongs in every portfolio.\n\n## 4\\. Bonds for safety and stability\n\nThe **Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Admiral Shares** (NASDAQMUTFUND: VBIAX)\ncarries 40% of its holdings in bonds, a good hedge against fears of an\neventual recession that could shift assets somewhat away from equities. Bonds\nmay be boring and certainly do reduce the potential of returns. However, they\nadd an element of safety to the list of equity-based funds I've put forth.\nMarket watchers have noticed the recent outflows from equity funds, with more\nallocation moving into bonds and cash. The fund's bond allocation is 45.87% in\nthe government sector, 25.33% in the corporate sector, and 23.79% in\nsecuritized assets.\n\nWhile offering exposure to bonds, Vanguard Balanced Index Fund still holds\npopular names including Microsoft, **Apple** , **Amazon.com** , and\n**Berkshire Hathaway**.\n\n## 5\\. A fund with low expenses and low prices\n\nFocused on mid-cap value, the **Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund**\n(NASDAQMUTFUND: FLPSX) carries an [expense\nratio](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-a-mutual-fund-expense-\nratio.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=d16684b2-c8bf-444d-99c7-c62defb0032d)\nof 0.52 and invests in low-price stocks. The list includes small and medium-\nsized businesses; its top 10 holdings include **UnitedHealth Group** , **Ross\nStores** , **Seagate Technology** , **Best Buy** , **AutoZone** , and\n**Metlife**. Morningstar gives the fund a five-star rating, with low risk.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, the fund has averaged an annual return of 13.35%.\nMore recently, it has lagged the market a bit, as more large-cap growth names\ndominate the market. Nonetheless, the low-risk nature of the fund, and its\nhistorical track record of outperforming, make it worth a look.\n\n**10 stocks we like better than Walmart**  \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can\npay to listen.

US venture firm Formation Group is a key backer of honestbee.\n\nMr Koo is the grandson of the founder of LG, the South Korean electronics\ngiant.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, honestbee announced plans to lay off 10 per cent of its\nglobal headcount and stop services in Indonesia and Hong Kong, as well as its\nfood vertical in Thailand. honestbee is also suspending services in The\nPhilippines and Japan.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether a cost-cutting honestbee has the means to open\nand maintain more offline stores.\n\nRaja Hamzah, managing partner of RHL Ventures, was sceptical. \"habitat focuses\non the high-end segment of the market, which... is limited. If they're on a\ncash conservation strategy, then it does not make sense to continue,\" he said.\n\nJan Ondrus, associate professor of information systems at ESSEC Business\nSchool, noted that an offline strategy could build loyalty, but that it may be\nchallenging for honestbee to enjoy the same success as Hema, the offline\nstores of Alibaba in China.\n\n\"The scale is different and Alibaba is able to leverage on their online\ndominance to beat the competition offline,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Christopher Quek, managing partner of venture firm Trive, thinks\nhabitat should be retained. He cited how the sporting goods outlet Decathlon\nhas managed to build a strong logistics network despite its remote outlet in\nJoo Koon.\n\nIn contrast, succeeding in grocery delivery may be a tough feat. \"The existing\nbusiness of gig economy grocery concierge may not be the best option to\nsustain, as acquisition costs remain high,\" Mr Quek said.\n\nBeyond the rationale for keeping habitat, many unanswered questions remain\nabout how a once-promising startup appears to have descended into turmoil.\n\nMr Quek of Trive points to how RedMart highlighted the challenges of grocery\ndelivery. \"Redmart as a competitor, which had its own warehouses and logistics\nfleet, failed to be valued high and (reportedly) exited around US$30-40\nmillion, when its investors put in US$55 million.\n\n\"It showed that the grocery space was not as viable as it should have been. I\nwould surmise that honestbee tried to fundraise but did not get investors due\nto this reason,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Hamzah of RHL thinks that honestbee's pivot to food delivery may\nbe a key factor. \"The grocery delivery business was already a tough place to\noperate in.\n\n\"honestbee then tried to pivot and expand into food delivery, which was\nalready a saturated space with incumbents including Deliveroo and foodpanda.\nBoth are high-burn businesses which require steep capital, which honestbee\ndoes not (appear to) have.\"\n\nThere remains little clarity on how exactly honestbee may have \"overstretched\"\nits finances, agreed Lawrence Loh, associate professor at the National\nUniversity of Singapore Business School.\n\nBut at the very least, compared to embattled water treatment firm Hyflux,\nhonestbee appears to have the good fortune of an \"internal white knight\".\n\"They have a backer that can reasonably revive the whole company. Going\nforward, we can see some certainty,\" he said.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n[honestbee](/keywords/honestbee)\n\n[formation group](/keywords/formation-group)\n\n[Purchase this article\n__](https://newslink.sg/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=BT&date=05/03/2019&title=honestbee\nCEO replaced; firm said to be sticking to habitat growth)\n\n## More from Garage\n\n12:50 PM\n\nApr 7, 2020 12:50 PM\n\n[Garage](/garage)\n\n##  [honestbee creditor Benjamin Lim applies to wind up\ncompany](/garage/honestbee-creditor-benjamin-lim-applies-to-wind-up-company)\n\nA CREDITOR of honestbee, Benjamin Lim Jia-Rong, has filed a court application\nto wind up the distressed startup,...\n\n05:50 AM\n\nMar 27, 2020 05:50 AM\n\n[Companies & Markets](/companies-markets)\n\n __\n\n## [honestbee loses court protection from creditors](/garage/honestbee-loses-\ncourt-protection-from-creditors)\n\nTHE Singapore High Court has dismissed honestbee's application to convene a\nscheme meeting to restructure some US$...\n\n06:12 PM\n\nMar 26, 2020 06:12 PM\n\n[Garage](/garage)\n\n##  [High Court dismisses honestbee\u2019s restructuring bid; creditors may wind up\nfirm](/garage/high-court-dismisses-honestbee\u2019s-restructuring-bid-creditors-\nmay-wind-up-firm)\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed honestbee\u2019s application to convene a scheme\nmeeting in its effort to restructure some...\n\n## [Breaking](/breaking-news)\n\n03:00 PM\n\nApr 8, 2020 03:00 PM\n\n[Government & Economy](/government-economy)\n\n##  [Singapore telecom networks to be upgraded as more residents work, learn\nat home: IMDA](/government-economy/singapore-telecom-networks-to-be-upgraded-\nas-more-residents-work-learn-at-home)\n\nSINGAPORE will make immediate investments in its telecom ecosystem, as the\nlatest pandemic-related movement control...\n\n02:52 PM\n\nApr 8, 2020 02:52 PM\n\n[Government & Economy](/government-economy)\n\n##  [France's central bank estimates first-quarter GDP shrunk 6% from previous\nquarter](/government-economy/frances-central-bank-estimates-first-quarter-gdp-\nshrunk-6-from-previous-quarter)\n\n[PARIS] France's economy likely contracted 6 per cent in the first quarter\nfrom the previous three months as a...\n\n02:45 PM\n\nApr 8, 2020 02:45 PM\n\n[Companies & Markets](/companies-markets)\n\n##  [SGX suspends watch-list entry, raises share issue limit](/companies-\nmarkets/sgx-suspends-watch-list-entry-raises-share-issue-limit)\n\nSINGAPORE Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) will suspend entry into its\nfinancial watch-list and enable faster fund...\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n### STAY UPDATED\n\n#### Get the latest on startups and business news\n\n[Terms & conditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)\n\nSign up\n\n__\n\n[![](/sites/all/themes/custom/garage/images/logo-light.png)](/garage)\n\nAll the startup news, insights and opinions behind one door\n\n##### **TOPICS**\n\n[All News](/garage/news) [Opinion](/garage/opinion)\n[Profiles](/garage/profiles) [Funding](/garage/funding)\n\n##### **FOLLOW US**\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/thebusinesstimes)[__](https://twitter.com/businesstimes)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/the-\nbusiness-times)[__](https://www.instagram.com/btlifestyle/)\n\nPowered by\n\n[![](//www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/bt-logo-72.png)](/)\n\n[![](/sites/all/themes/custom/garage/images/logo-light.png) ](/garage)\n\n[ STARTUPS IN-DEPTH BY THE BUSINESS TIMES ](/garage)\n\n[\n\n##### **ALL NEWS**\n\n](/garage/news) [\n\n##### **OPINION**\n\n](/garage/opinion) [\n\n##### **PROFILES**\n\n](/garage/profiles) [\n\n##### **FUNDING**\n\n](/garage/funding)\n\n##### **FOLLOW US**\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/thebusinesstimes)[__](https://twitter.com/businesstimes)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/the-\nbusiness-times)[__](https://www.instagram.com/btlifestyle/)\n\nPowered by\n\n[![](//www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/bt-logo-72.png)](/)\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:BTNews@sph.com.sg) [Terms &\nConditions](https://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html) [Data & Protection\nPolicy](https://www.sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)\n[Advertise](mailto:mkgsales@sph.com.sg)\n\n**SPH Digital News / Copyright \u00a9 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

In 1998, he penned the\nclassic _Harvard Business Review_ article \"[What Makes a\nLeader](https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader),\" where he made this\nindisputable statement:\n\n> The most effective leaders are all alike in one crucial way: they all have a\n> high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. It's not\n> that IQ and technical skills are irrelevant. They do matter, but ... they\n> are the entry-level requirements for executive positions. My research, along\n> with other recent studies, clearly shows that emotional intelligence is the\n> sine qua non of leadership. Without it, a person can have the best training\n> in the world, an incisive, analytical mind, and an endless supply of smart\n> ideas, but he still won't make a great leader.\n\nThat aside, did you know that emotional intelligence can also increase your\nincome? _Drastically_ increase it?\n\n## Raise your income by $29,000\n\nThat's right. [According to\nresearch](https://www.talentsmart.com/articles/Increasing-Your-Salary-with-\nEmotional-Intelligence-983916766-p-1.html), people with high levels of\nemotional intelligence earn an average of $29,000[\n](http://www.talentsmart.com/about/emotional-intelligence.php)more annually\nthan those with less emotional intelligence. Research just gave you 29,000\ngood reasons to improve yours.\n\nTravis Bradberry, co-author of _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , [conducted the\nstudy](https://www.talentsmart.com/articles/Increasing-Your-Salary-with-\nEmotional-Intelligence-983916766-p-1.html) in which his team tested the EQ of\nover 42,000 people and compared their scores with their annual incomes.\n\nIn his report, Bradberry states, \"The road to higher income is paved with the\nquality of your relationships. People earn more money as they become more\nemotionally intelligent.\"\n\n## How to increase your EQ\n\nThe road to higher emotional intelligence is not a destination, it's a\njourney. But the path along the journey to building up your EQ skills will pay\noff in many ways, including enlarging your bank account.\n\nThere is a plethora of strategies, suggestions, and ideas floating around the\ninternet about how to best boost your EQ. To simplify, here are four\nfoundational ways to do it with good practice and intentionality.\n\n## 1\\. Raise your self-awareness\n\nThis is the first part of emotional intelligence and involves familiarizing\nyourself with your emotions. Ever wonder why you feel the way you do\nsometimes, often leaving you confused? In boosting your self-awareness, you\nunderstand why certain situations or people make you sad, happy, angry, or\necstatic. So get to know your emotions--it will help you, especially when\nworking and collaborating with difficult personalities in close quarters.\n\n## 2\\. Learn self-control.\n\nA leader with high emotional intelligence is able to redirect disruptive\nemotions and  \nimpulses and not jump to any hasty conclusions. When a team botches a\ndelivery, a leader with EQ resists the urge to go off and point fingers. She\nwill step back, look at all the possible reasons why things didn't work out as\nplanned, explain the consequences to her team, and explore solutions with\nthem.\n\n## 3\\. Practice empathy.\n\nMaking sure employees feel valued is a prerequisite of great managers. Showing\nempathy around their experience--by seeking feedback--is one of the critical\nsteps to achieving that. First, listen intently with your mind _and_ heart,\nwithout judgment. Then switch the script in your head from \"driving people to\nperform\" to serving their needs so they feel empowered to thrive. When you do\nthat, you'll have more opportunities for practicing empathy.  \n\n## 4\\. Be visible to others.\n\nDuring the hard times, leaders with a high degree of EQ don't hide behind\nclosed doors or conveniently delegate important communication needs to others.\nThey are out on the front lines sharing plans for the future, addressing\nquestions and concerns, and calming fears and apprehensions. Employees look to\nsuch leaders for information, clear expectations, and the status of what's\ngoing on when the chips are down. This is why visible and approachable leaders\nwill \"walk their four corners.\" They check in with their people and personally\nanswer questions to ensure the trust is ongoing and people feel safe.\n\nTruth be told, not every personality is wired for naturally solving problems\nwith soft-skill solutions as posed above. If this is your challenge, do what\nmost good leaders do: Invest in hiring a good coach who can help facilitate\nyour process of self-discovery to raise your EQ. As you gain new awareness,\nintegrate the behavioral change into daily decision making and personal\ninteractions. Then watch your income grow.\n\nPublished on: Feb 24, 2020\n\nLike this column?

And for good\nreason. But how you offboard employees can be just as important. When people\nleave, you should show them the same kind of appreciation and support you did\nwhen they were part of your company. You might end up rehiring that person\ndown the road. They can be can be a valuable resource for the transition\nfollowing their exit and more likely to help if they're not left with a bad\ntaste in their mouth. And, for those who remain, it drives home the point that\nthe organization cares about its employees as people. So, when someone tells\nyou they are moving on, listen to what they have to say about why. Show them\nthey are valued. Point out talents and abilities that will serve them well in\ntheir new job. And don't stop these efforts after the employee walks out the\ndoor. Drop them the occasional line asking how they are.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/05/May19_20_523742377.jpg) Jorg\nGreuel/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/05/your-company-needs-a-process-for-offboarding-\nemployees-gracefully?language=es)\n\nWhen I left my job at O.C. Tanner to help create a tech startup in Portland,\nOregon, 19 years ago, I had no intention of returning. I had loved the job but\nwas moving on to other opportunities. At a farewell lunch with my team at a\nlocal restaurant, we were all surprised and admittedly a little tense when the\nCEO walked in and asked to say a few words. He explained that he wanted to\npersonally thank me for the work I\u2019d done and told me I had an open invitation\nto come back to the company if things didn\u2019t work out. Then he reached into\nhis jacket pocket, handed me a one-way airline ticket from Portland back to\nSalt Lake City, and said \u201cI mean it.\u201d\n\nThe encounter was unexpected \u2014 I hadn\u2019t interacted much with the CEO during my\nyears at O.C. Tanner \u2014 but it left an indelible mark. I didn\u2019t end up using\nthat return ticket, but when he called me two and a half years later, just as\nthe startup I had joined was taking off, I listened. And, when he offered me\nthe position held by my previous leader, I took him up on it.\n\nLeaders put a high priority on recruitment and onboarding. And for good\nreason. Those first few days or weeks can be _[quite\ninfluential](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-\nacquisition/pages/dont-underestimate-the-importance-of-effective-\nonboarding.aspx)_. In fact, research we conducted as part of our 2018 Global\nCulture Report, which surveyed more than 15,000 workers across a dozen\ncountries, shows that when onboarding is successful \u2014 centered on training,\nconnecting the new hire to purpose, and recognizing early accomplishments \u2014\nthere is a 70% increase in an employee\u2019s sense of belonging, a 50% increase in\ntheir engagement, and a 37% increase in their understanding of organizational\npurpose. Conversely, a bad onboarding experience can leave the employee\nfeeling uncertain about their decision to join, the importance of their role,\nor their future at the company. Turnover is expensive, and studies show that\n_[up to half of new\nemployees](https://www.shrm.org/foundation/ourwork/initiatives/resources-from-\npast-initiatives/Documents/Onboarding%20New%20Employees.pdf)_ leave soon after\nstarting \u2014 within 120 days for hourly employees, and within the first 18\nmonths for senior hires. Nearly a quarter of the U.S. workforce has been at\ntheir current position less than a year.\n\nAs important as onboarding and building loyalty is, we need to devote similar\nenergy to what we do when employees leave. It can be easy to write off people\nwho are departing, but there are many reasons to instead appreciate and\nsupport them.\n\nFirst, as my story shows, rehiring is a real and often smart option. Companies\nwho bring back former employees benefit from their deep _[familiarity with\nculture and processes](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252173)_ , saving\nthe expense of having to train an entirely new hire (at a cost of as much as\n_[six to nine months](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/312123/employee-\nretention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee)_ of the departing person\u2019s\nsalary). The rehire also brings with them the experience, expertise, and\ncontacts they have gained while away. When I returned to O.C. Tanner, for\nexample, I found the lessons I had learned building a successful startup\nhelped me considerably in my new, broader role. And it\u2019s been exciting to\nwatch other returning employees come back better than they were when they\nleft.\n\n#### You and Your Team Series\n\n### Retention\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/09/further-reading-widget-remote.png)\n\n######  [How to Lose Your Best Employees](/2018/04/how-to-lose-your-best-\nemployees)\n\n    * Whitney Johnson\n\n######  [To Retain New Hires, Make Sure You Meet with Them in Their First\nWeek](/2018/06/to-retain-new-hires-make-sure-you-meet-with-them-in-their-\nfirst-week)\n\n    * Dawn Klinghoffer et al.\n\n######  [Why Great Employees Leave \u201cGreat Cultures\u201d](/2018/05/why-great-\nemployees-leave-great-cultures)\n\n    * Melissa Daimler\n\nEven if you don\u2019t end up rehiring a former employee, you will find  _[other\nadvantages](/2016/01/the-right-way-to-off-board-a-departing-employee)_  to\ngiving them a positive and meaningful offboarding experience.  They can be\nvaluable resources during the transition \u2014 and more likely to help if they\u2019re\nnot left with a bad taste in their mouth. Those who remain will see that the\ncompany cares about its workers as people, not just as cogs in a machine that\nare easily ignored or discarded when they cease to be useful.  And employees\nwho have been sent out on a supportive note might just recommend your\norganization to talented workers they meet in the future, creating a new\nnetwork of talent from which to draw.\n\nHere are a few ways to better offboard valuable employees:\n\n### **Really listen**\n\nWhen someone tells you they are leaving, listen to what they have to say about\nwhy. Respect the fact that they\u2019ve initiated this difficult conversation and\nare sharing the reasons for this potentially disruptive change to their life.\nAre they leaving their job, team, or manager; or are they leaving for the\nopportunity? You might discover there are issues about which you were\npreviously unaware, and, while this conversation may have come too late to\nkeep this particular employee from leaving, you may be able to improve the\nworkplace \u2014 and retention \u2014 for remaining employees.\n\n### **Show appreciation**\n\nYou want to have a candid, honest, and appreciative conversation with a\ndeparting employee. This is your opportunity to call out specific ways the\nperson has contributed to the team and your company\u2019s success and to point out\ntalents and abilities that they might not have noticed themselves but will\nserve them well in their new job. Think of this as a goodbye gift.\n\n### **Stay in touch**\n\nYour efforts shouldn\u2019t stop after an employee walks out the door. Keep in\ncontact. Drop them the occasional line asking how they are. If you see them at\nindustry events, or on social media, reach out. If you happen to visit their\nnew city, offer to take them to lunch. These kinds of touch points show that\neven when they\u2019re off the payroll, they\u2019re still a valued member of the\ncompany\u2019s extended community. It\u2019s another chance to show genuine caring.\n\nA few years ago, I was able to put this learning into practice.  When a\ntalented director on my team let me know he was leaving, I was dismayed. But I\nunderstood the value of the career choice he was making and thanked him for\nwhat he had done for us. I made sure he knew the door was open for him to\nreturn but that I supported his growth and development even if he never chose\nto do so. Interestingly, he just reached out to me a couple of months ago to\nsee if there was a spot back on our team.\n\nWe all know how important it is to show employees that they are valued. But\nmore companies and managers should extend that appreciation to people long\npast their last day of work. When you give offboarding the same care and\nconsideration as onboarding, your team and organization are better positioned\nto thrive.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2015/10/110-David_Sturt.jpg)\n\n[David Sturt](/search?term=david%20sturt&search_type=search-all) is Executive\nVice President at O.C.

If Not, Stop Doing These 10 Things\n\n## Attracting top talent is only the first step. You also have to keep them\naround.\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/Bariso-\nprofile_265796.JPG)](/author/justin-bariso)[By Justin Bariso](/author/justin-\nbariso)Author, EQ\nApplied[@JustinJBariso](https://www.twitter.com/JustinJBariso)\n\n![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_503627749_200013331653767174267_369400.jpg)\n\nGetty Images\n\nCompanies spend billions of dollars every year on the recruiting and\ninterviewing process. Why? Because they want to make sure they're hiring the\nbest.\n\nWhat many employers forget, though, is they need to work just as hard to keep\ntheir people around.\n\nThink about it: The better someone is at their job, the more options they\nhave. In fact, every day headhunters and rival companies are working hard to\nlure your best people away.\n\nInterestingly, [recent research from ](https://www.inc.com/justin-\nbariso/google-spent-years-studying-great-teams-these-5-qualities-contributed-\nmost-to-their-success.html)[Google](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-\nspent-years-studying-great-teams-these-5-qualities-contributed-most-to-their-\nsuccess.html) indicates that there's a major disconnect between how executives\nand team members measure effectiveness in the workplace. While executives\ncared more about numbers and results, individual team members were far more\nconcerned with team culture.\n\nRemember, people leave managers, not companies. So if you're serious about\nkeeping your best people around, use your [emotional\nintelligence](https://www.eqapplied.com/) to make sure you're not committing\none of the following mistakes:\n\n## 1\\. Communicate poorly.\n\nNo relationship can thrive without good communication.\n\nIn a series of recent studies, [research organization Gallup\nconcluded](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182321/employees-lot-\nmanagers.aspx):\n\n  * Employees whose managers hold regular meetings with them are almost three times as likely to be engaged.\n  * Managers who use a combination of face-to-face, phone, and electronic communication are the most successful in engaging employees.\n  * Engaged employees report that when attempting to contact their manager, he or she returns their calls or messages within 24 hours.\n\nAdditionally, Gallup's research found employees value communication from their\nmanagers about \"what happens in their lives outside of work.\"\n\nIn other words, treat your people like people, not resources you're trying to\nsuck dry.\n\n## 2\\. Fail to express appreciation.\n\nWe all crave acknowledgment and praise for a job well done. Neglect to do so\nfor your people, and they'll look for appreciation somewhere else.\n\nInstead, tell your people what they're doing well. Be sincere, the more\nspecific the better. If you tell your colleagues exactly what they're doing\nright, they'll be motivated to do more of it.\n\nAnd remember, everyone deserves commendation for something. By learning to\nidentify, recognize, and praise those talents, you bring out the best in them.\n\n## 3\\. Expect too much work.\n\nGreat workers are willing to put in extra hours from time-to-time. They'll put\nin an extra shift when needed, even work the weekend to meet deadline.\n\nBut this should be an exception, not the rule. This type of schedule is not\nsustainable--even if your best people don't leave voluntarily, you're putting\nthem on the road to burnout.  \n\n## 4\\. Severely limit the team. (Instead of empowering them.)\n\nYour people crave a certain degree of freedom: they want to explore new ideas,\nto experiment, to develop their own working style.\n\nBut they still want you to be interested in their work. And they still need\nhelp from time to time.\n\nSo, be a manager, not a micromanager. Use questions that allow you to guide,\nrather than take over. Be willing to share your experience, but allow them to\nstay in the driver's seat.\n\nThis will help your people develop the experience and confidence they need to\nsolve similar problems in the future--and help them to see you as a coach and\nmentor, instead of the clueless boss.\n\n## 5\\. Show a lack of flexibility.\n\nTechnology has changed the face of work. While some still prefer a traditional\noffice, more and more want the option to work remotely, at least part-time.\nAnd there are some great tools out there to help workers not only be more\nefficient at their jobs, but have fun working, too.\n\nIf you're not making these provisions available, you can be sure other\nemployers are.\n\n## 6\\. Be exclusive, not inclusive.\n\nBad managers only invite a few into their \"club,\" making others feel that they\ndon't belong and that their ideas are worthless.\n\nIn contrast, great managers build trust among their teams. They make everyone\nfeel included, so teammates feel safe to ask questions, offer new ideas, take\nrisks, and admit mistakes. They recognize that there is power in diversity--\nand they leverage that diversity to do great things.\n\n## 7\\. Avoid transparency.\n\nAs an employee, there's nothing worse than the feeling that your manager or\ncompany leaders are keeping you in the dark. In contrast, great companies keep\ntheir people in the loop, promoting a true team atmosphere.\n\nIf your company's dealing with specific problems, don't be afraid to share. A\nmember of your team may have the solution--but your people can't help if you\nshut them out.\n\n## 8\\. Refuse to challenge your people.\n\nIf you feel your team runs like a well-oiled machine, it's easy to keep giving\nyour people the exact same tasks, over and over.\n\nThere's only one problem: Smart employees get easily bored. They want to be\nchallenged, to learn new things, to grow.\n\nDon't be afraid to give constructive feedback, as long as you've already\ngained your people's trust through praise and commendation. Give them\nopportunities to develop professionally, through classes or hands-on training.\n\nAlso remember that when it comes to the future, people need options: Not\neveryone wants to follow the same road, so providing a variety of career paths\nto follow within the company gives your people the chance to find their way.\n\nGreat bosses don't only see the potential in their people, they help them to\nreach it.\n\n## 9\\. Set a poor example.\n\nToo many managers are more concerned with titles than with action. They want\nrecognition as the boss, while their team wonders what it is they actually do.\n\nGreat bosses are hard workers; they're not afraid to do dirty work. They don't\nask people to do work they haven't done (or wouldn't do) themselves. They get\nto know the nuances of a job and are skilled at the work they oversee.\n\nBut what if you've been brought into a new department? Take time to\nfamiliarize yourself with your people's everyday work and challenges. This\nwill earn you the respect of your team.\n\n## 10\\. Fail to follow through.\n\nGreat managers:\n\n  * take the lead\n  * make tough decisions\n  * make sure everyone understands the reasons behind those decisions\n  * execute\n\nSteps one through three are hard enough, but step four is the most difficult.\n\nSo, be decisive. Say what you mean, and mean what you say. Keep everyone on\nthe same page.\n\nThen, commit to following through.\n\nIf you don't, you can be sure your best people will look for someone who does.\n\nPublished on: Sep 12, 2018\n\nLike this column?

Here's why.\n\nAuthor:\n\n    [Brian O'Connell](/author/brian-oconnell)\nPublish date:\n\n    Dec 24, 2018 1:55 PM EST\n\nTheSTreet\n\n  *   *   * \n\nIn business circles, employers can't always attract the best professional help\nvia salary alone.\n\nThus, the ascent of the fringe benefit - valued employee benefits that seal\nthe deal between employer and employee, bringing top talent on board by adding\nlucrative benefits like health care and a company-owned vehicle, among other\nfringe benefits, to an employee's financial package.\n\nStill, employees fortunate enough to be the recipient of fringe benefits\nshouldn't take those benefits without factoring in key questions like tax\nliability, the shelf life of certain fringe benefits, and whether or not they\ncan be taken away from you in a moment's notice.\n\nWhile employers are a good first resource for education on fringe benefits,\nit's up to you, the employee, to learn all you can about fringe benefits, and\nhow to optimize the career \"swag bag\" experience.\n\nHere's how to get that process rolling.\n\n## What Are Fringe Benefits?\n\nFringe benefits are an \"add-on\" form of employee compensation that employees\ncan offer career professionals in addition to just a wage or salary.\n\nTypical forms of fringe benefits include:\n\n  * Medical and dental insurance\n  * Year-end and performance bonuses\n  * [401k](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/what-is-401k-plan-14692968), [IRA](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/what-is-a-roth-ira-14673992) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan, including employee matching contribution plans\n  * Employee profit sharing\n  * A company car or SUV\n  * Housing allowance\n  * Educational assistance\n  * Vacation and vacation pay\n  * Sick days and sick pay\n  * Free meals, drinks and snacks\n  * Wellness stipends (like paying for a gym membership)\n  * Permission to keep your frequent flyer points and card rewards earned on business trips, which can be used for private trips\n\nRecently, companies have also started to offer student loan payoff assistance\nand free digital devices (think smartphones and tablet computers) to staffers.\nAlso, since telecommuting has become a burgeoning workplace option, companies\nare also offering to help workers pay for cable connections and smartphone\nbills.\n\nMaternity leave and paternity support are also examples of fringe benefits\nthat weren't around 10 years ago, but are today.\n\nOnce you add all of the above fringe benefits together, you have what human\nresources managers refer to as \"total compensation, which is accumulated as\nfollows:\n\n _Salary and wages, plus paid benefits = total compensation_.\n\nStructurally, employers will provide an employee benefits statement that lists\nall the fringe benefits given, and present it to the employee, both for\norganizational and tax reasons.\n\nThat list is generated annually, and includes regular income (i.e., an\nemployee's salary or wages). It also lists partial payments the employer makes\nmake on benefits like health and life insurance. The employee benefits list is\nalso considered by employers as a morale boost and statement of loyalty to\nvalued employees. Certainly, many career professionals who receive large\nfringe benefit packages from their employers feel that way.\n\nEmployers also hope that good \"word of mouth\" kicks in, and that their\nemployees will tell talented workers at other companies about their company's\ngenerosity in prioritizing fringe benefits, leading to stronger hires, higher\nemployee performance, and more robust company revenues.\n\n## Why Do Companies Offer Fringe Benefits?\n\nEmployers load up on fringe benefits because they have to - it's simply the\ncost of doing business and remaining competitive in their industry.\n\nLook at it this way.\n\nTalented career professionals have all kinds of employment landing spots,\nespecially since the economy has been on the upswing. To attract that talent,\ncompanies have to offer lucrative employment compensation package that\nincludes an ample salary and most - or all - of the fringe benefits listed\nabove.\n\nIf they don't, their competitors will, and could load their own firms up with\ntalented, game-changing engineers, accountants, or sales professionals (among\nmany other vocations) who can significantly and positively impact on the\nhiring company's bottom line.\n\nStudies show that career professionals place a great value on employee\ncompensation that goes beyond salary and wages.\n\nPlenty of valued employees have moved on from a company if they don't seem the\nfringe benefits sufficient, and go to a company where ample employee\ncompensation is a big priority.\n\n## Five Reasons Why Fringe Benefits Are so Important to Workers\n\nBesides earning more financial benefits (which is always appealing to\nworkers), why are fringe benefits so important to career professionals? Here's\na snapshot:\n\n### 1\\. Happier and More Productive Workers\n\nStudy after study shows that the more employee benefits a career professional\nreceives, the happier and better they are on the job.\n\n### 2\\. Healthier Workers\n\nAccess to good health insurance coverage and wellness programs (like that gym\nmembership) will have you feeling better and doing the types of things (like\nworking out and visiting your doctor regularly) that will lead to a longer\nlife expectancy.\n\n### 3\\. Opportunities for Career Advancement\n\nGetting fringe benefits like job training and educational assistance will give\nnew skills that can be put to work in your own vocation, and can lead to\npromotions, higher salaries, and better-paying posts down the road.\n\n### 4\\. Save on Auto Payments and Vehicle Insurance\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to be given a company car, you'll not only save\nthousands of dollars on auto payments every year, you'll save big on vehicle\ninsurance and maintenance, too.\n\n### 5\\. Saving Money on Meals\n\nCompanies that provide free meals or meal discounts are a boon to career\nprofessionals who love to eat well and save money. The more free meals you\nconsume in the workplace, the less you're paying for breakfast, lunch or even\ndinner away from the job.\n\n## Tax Issues With Fringe Benefits\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service largely considers fringe benefits to be part of a\ntaxpayer's gross revenues from their employers. That means, according to IRS\nrules, fringe benefits are subject to income tax withholding and employment\ntaxes.\n\nTo both employees and employers, the IRS does offer an annual Taxable Fringe\nBenefit Guide to steer staffers and managers in the right direction on\npossible fringe benefit tax liabilities.\n\nBy and large, the IRS deems employee benefits in one of three categories:\n\n  * Nontaxable (like qualified health plans.)\n  * Partially taxable (like transportation benefits.)\n  * Tax-deferred (that means you have to pay taxes eventually, but not right now. A 401k plan or a [pension plan](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/savings/what-is-a-pension-plan-14638343) is a good example of a tax-deferred employee benefit.)\n\nFringe benefits are largely tax-exempt to employers, thus giving companies\nmore incentive to provide them to employees.\n\n## How to Value Fringe Benefits\n\nFor employers and employees, fairly valuing fringe benefits is an important\ntask.\n\n  * For employers, valuing company perks and benefits is needed to recognize the total value of any and all compensation. That will keep you in compliance and give you a road map for just how much providing fringe benefits will cost with future employees.\n  * For employees, properly valuing fringe benefits puts you in compliance with IRS rules, and gives you a measuring stick when competing offers roll in and you need to make a career decision.\n\nThat means figuring out how all of those benefits are calculated, taxed and\nreported to the IRS.\n\nWhile using the fair market value assessment model is the standard used in\nvaluing fringe benefits, it's not the only way.\n\nLet's take a look at possible fringe benefit valuation possibilities:\n\n### Fair Market Value\n\nYou can ascertain the fair market value of fringe benefits by figuring out how\nmuch the employee would have had to pay for all of their total benefits, if\ntheir employer hadn't provided them. Such a calculation must include any\ncompensation paid toward the benefit by the employer.\n\n### Valuing Company Vehicles\n\nTo calculate the market value of a company vehicle, just calculate how much a\nstaffer would have to pay to rent, lease or buy the vehicle in question. Use\nIRS Form 15-B to locate the vehicle's standard mileage rate (.58 cents per\nmile in 2019) and multiply that rate by the total number of miles the staffer\ndrives in a company vehicle on personal business. The resulting figure to get\nthe car or SUV's value, which should be included in the staffer's salary or\nwages.\n\n### Commuting Benefits\n\nFor commuting purposes, you can establish the value of any company vehicle by\nmultiplying every one-way commute to the office by $1.50. Again, the resulting\nfigure should be included by the employer in the employee's wages and salary.  \n\n## A \"Win-Win\" Deal\n\nNo doubt, employers and employees likely view fringe benefits as a \"win-win\"\nproposition.\n\nFor employers, fringe benefits translate into happier and more productive\nemployees, and a better reputation among employees who may be considering\nworking for the firm.\n\nFor employees, fringe benefits can translate into substantial cost savings,\nmore cash for retirement, and even healthier diets and lifestyles.\n\nThat's a pretty good deal for both parties, thus ensuring even bigger and\nbetter fringe benefit packages between employers and employees down the road.\n\nTags\n\nterms:\n\n    [Accounting](/tag/accounting)[Money Basics](/tag/money-basics)[Insurance](/tag/insurance)[Tools](/tag/tools)[Tax Tips](/tag/tax-tips)[Health Insurance](/tag/health-insurance)[Car Insurance](/tag/car-insurance)[Taxes](/tag/taxes)[Education](/tag/education)[Personal Finance](/tag/personal-finance)[Tax Planning](/tag/tax-planning)\n\nBy\n\n[Brian O'Connell](/author/brian-oconnell)\n\n  *   *   * \n\n[![Stock Market Traders New York Stock\nExchange](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4ODExNDY1NTgxNTM2NDUz/wall-\nstreet.jpg)](/markets/5-things-you-must-know-before-the-market-opens-\nwednesday-040820 \"Tesla, Jack Dorsey, Zoom Video, Coronavirus Crisis - 5\nThings You Must Know Wednesday\")\n\n[MARKETS](/markets)\n\n[\n\n## Tesla, Jack Dorsey, Zoom Video, Coronavirus Crisis - 5 Things You Must Know\nWednesday\n\n](/markets/5-things-you-must-know-before-the-market-opens-wednesday-040820)\n\n  * [By Joseph Woelfel](/author/joseph-woelfel)\n\n[![Wall Street Spent $2 Billion on the\nElection](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4NjUxNjE1NzU4MzI5NzUx/wall-\nstreet-spent-2-billion-on-the-election.jpg)](/investing/dow-futures-slip-\ncoronavirus-volatility-clips-global-rally \"Dow Futures Slide As Coronavirus\nVolatility Clips Global Rally\")\n\n[INVESTING](/investing)\n\n[\n\n## Dow Futures Slide as Coronavirus Volatility Clips Global Rally\n\n](/investing/dow-futures-slip-coronavirus-volatility-clips-global-rally)\n\n  * [By Martin Baccardax](/author/martin-baccardax)\n\n[![Zoom\nLead](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTcxNTQ5NTE0NDgwNDk0MDUx/zoom.jpg)](/investing/zoom-\nslides-as-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-security-flaws \"Zoom Shares Extend\nSlide As Class Action Lawsuit Alleges Security Failures in Popular\nCommunications App\")\n\n[INVESTING](/investing)\n\n[\n\n## Zoom Shares Extend Slide As Class Action Lawsuit Alleges Security Failures\nin Popular Communications App\n\n](/investing/zoom-slides-as-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-security-flaws)\n\n  * [By Martin Baccardax](/author/martin-baccardax)\n\n[![Wall Street\nLead](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTcxMzQxNTg4OTM5Njc5NDEx/wall-\nstreet_15.jpg)](/jim-cramer/dark-before-the-dawn-cramers-mad-money-recap-\napril-7 \"Dark Before the Dawn: Cramer's 'Mad Money' Recap \\(Tuesday 4/7/20\\)\")\n\n[JIM CRAMER](/jim-cramer)\n\n[\n\n## Dark Before the Dawn: Cramer's 'Mad Money' Recap (Tuesday 4/7/20)\n\n](/jim-cramer/dark-before-the-dawn-cramers-mad-money-recap-april-7)\n\n  * [By Scott Rutt](/author/scott-rutt)\n\n[![Video: Jim Cramer on Why We Need More Financial\nEducation](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4NjUwOTkyOTg5MTg1Njcx/video-\njim-cramer-on-why-we-need-more-financial-education.jpg)](/investing/tal-\neducation-plunges-in-after-hours-on-sales-fraud-disclosure \"TAL Education\nPlunges in After-Hours on Sales Fraud Disclosure\")\n\n[INVESTING](/investing)\n\n[\n\n## TAL Education Plunges in After-Hours on Sales Fraud Disclosure\n\n](/investing/tal-education-plunges-in-after-hours-on-sales-fraud-disclosure)\n\n  * [By Tom Bemis](/author/tom-bemis)\n\n[![Is Pinterest The Next Unicorn to\nWatch?](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4NjUwNTQ3MTE4NzQ1MjIz/is-\npinterest-the-next-unicorn-to-watch.jpg)](/investing/pinterest-pulls-full-\nyear-outlook-coo-leaving-company \"Pinterest Pulls Full-Year Outlook Due to\nCovid-19 Uncertainty;

Kamala and Elizabeth and Yodelin' Zeke!  Biden\nand Beto and Butterball Jackson! Cory and Mayor Pete and Big Shirtless Ron! To\nmake matters worse, the quality of the content wasn't much better than what\nyou'd find on  _Ya Hoo!,  _with each candidate reduced to shouting over one\nanother in a desperate attempt to provide a memorable soundbite.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the field has mercifully been winnowed to\ntwen....wait...that can't be right...there's still _twenty?  _Fine..now that\nthe field is down to twenty, it's time to start taking (most of) the remaining\ncontestants seriously.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, waves while arriving on\nstage during the...

I do, however, know a bit about\ntaxes, and tax policy is going to be a  _huge_  part of the 2020 election.\n\nTo this point, President Trump's signature legislation remains the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (TCJA), the sweeping reform that unfolded at the tail end of\n2017. The TCJA will serve as a 2020 battleground because of its two most\nnotable characteristics, which one would  _think_  would be mutually\nexclusive:\n\n  1. It cut taxes for 9 out of 10 individuals earning more than $50,000, and\n  2. It is  _wildly  _unpopular.\n\nHow can both of these things be true? Here's a little secret...there's only\none thing people hate more than NOT getting a tax cut, and that's  _getting_\na cut, only to find out that your richer friend got a bigger one.\n\nAnd that's the reality of the TCJA: while Joe Sixpack fared pretty well under\nthe new law, Joe's [boss did substantially\nbetter](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-would-cut-taxes-\naverage-1600-2018-most-benefits-going-those-making-300000-plus), which\nexplains why[ less than 40% of the country approves of the President's tax\nbill](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_republicans_tax_reform_law-6446.html).\nThe remaining 60%, well...they think the bill was a giveaway to the rich, and\nthey ain't happy about it.\n\nAs 2020 approaches, Republicans will choose to keep the focus on the first of\nthe two characteristics of the TCJA, arguing that the bill cut taxes on most\nAmericans (it did), boosted the economy (the jury is still out), and\nsimplified the tax law (it most certainly did not).\n\n**_Read more about the other Democratic candidates\u2019 tax plans:[Joe\nBiden](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2019/09/30/reviewing-the-\ndemocratic-candidates-tax-plans-joe-biden/#1a42684e799c), [Michael\nBloomberg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2020/02/04/reviewing-the-\ndemocratic-candidates-tax-plans-michael-bloomberg/#2a0e6e19232a), [Elizabeth\nWarren](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2019/09/23/reviewing-the-\ndemocratic-candidates-tax-plans-elizabeth-warren/#a11a8e57903c)._**  \n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have latched onto the latter characteristic,\ncontinuously highlighting the windfall to the rich and promising to correct\nthis perceived injustice. Doing so will not exactly require the assistance of\na master strategist; after all, if people hate the TCJA because it gave breaks\nto the rich, it would follow that any proposal that substantially increases\ntaxes on the wealthy should be quite popular. And if the past few months are\nany indication, this logic will hold true.\n\nIt all started when Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes casually threw out\nthe possibility of returning the top tax rate to the 70% standard it last\nreached in 1980. Now, if I've learned nothing else from three seasons of\nStranger Things, it's that people love anything rooted in 80's nostalgia, even\nif it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This same principle holds true for\nAOC's tax plan, because it was met with an [approval rating among voters of\n59%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-finds-broad-support-for-ocasio-\ncortezs-70-top-tax-rate-proposal-2019-01-15), despite the fact that a 70% rate\non income over $10 million is largely a symbolic gesture rather than a true\nrevenue raiser, because those earning that much either a) generate their\nearnings from capital gains, which are taxed at preferential rates, or b) have\nthe wherewithal to hire people like me to make sure their income never meets\nhead-on with a 70% marginal rate.\n\nSoon after, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading candidate for the Democratic\nnomination, informally introduced a proposal that would have once been\nunthinkable: an annual tax not on the  _income  _of the rich, but rather on\ntheir  _wealth_. While there are no shortage of legal, political, and\nadministrative hurdles to a wealth tax (which we'll address when we turn our\nattention to Warren's now-formalized proposal) nearly 61% of voters polled\nabout the wealth tax favored the idea.\n\nOther candidates were clearly taking notes, because as more formal proposals\nhave begun to trickle out from the remaining candidates, it's become clear\nthat they are unified in their goal to use  _significantly  _higher taxes on\nthe rich to pay for everything from the Green New Deal to student loan\nforgiveness to adding a second free Slurpee day 11/7.\n\nThere's a lot to keep track of, so over the next few weeks (read: months), we\nare going to use this space to break down the tax proposals of many of the\nremaining candidates, and ultimately, create a nice little side-by-side\ncomparison relative to current law. But before we do, one important caveat:\n\n**Don't shoot the messenger.**\n\nIf you don't like Bernie's top rate or Warren's wealth tax or Biden's plan for\na 40% tax on \"squares\" (probably), remember that I didn't write these plans,\nso please do me a favor and save the angry emails for your kid's middle school\nsoccer coach.\n\nWith that settled, we're going to start with Bernie Sanders, the Vermont\nSenator who is making a second spirited run for the White House.\n\n**Candidate: Bernie Sanders**\n\nOh boy. Not this again. Back in 2016, I wrote about Sanders' tax plan for\nForbes, and I'm still dealing with a mild case of PTSD from the comments to\nthat article. Needless to say, Sanders is a polarizing figure: to some, he\nrepresents the best way forward for a country that has been too profoundly\ndivided between the have's and have-not's; while for others, he is a purveyor\nof empty promises who won't rest until America is turned into a socialist\nwasteland.\n\nWhatever your thoughts on Sanders, we can all agree that he's got a lot of\nambitious plans, whether its expanding Social Security or providing Medicare\nand schooling for all. And these things cost money. Lots and lots of money. As\na result, Sander's tax proposal will have to raise quite a bit of revenue.\nHere's how it would shake out, in comparison to current law:\n\n**Top Rate On Ordinary Income**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**As part of the TCJA, the top rate on ordinary income --\nthings like wages, business income, and interest income -- was reduced from a\nhigh of 39.6% to 37%. Of course, the U.S. tax system is a  _progressive\nsystem, _meaning we pay higher rates as our income increases. Under the\ncurrent structure, those rates begin at 10%, and then climb to 37% via the\nfollowing steps: 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, and 35%. It's also important to note that\nthere is an additional 3.8% surcharge that applies to the \"net investment\nincome\"of certain high-income individuals -- things like interest income or\nincome from a business in which you don't actively participate (more on this\nlater) -- meaning the top rate on these forms of income can reach a high of\n40.8%.\n\n**_Sanders' Plan:  _**Sanders would retain the bottom six brackets and then\namend or add four more: the 35% rate under current law would become 40% for\nmany taxpayers, and then there would be additional rates of 45%, 50%, and\n66(!)%, with the final rate applying to income over $10 million. But...Sanders\nwould also impose a 4% \"income-based premium\" at each level above $29,000,\nwhich he claims would raise an additional $3.5 trillion over ten years, and\nwould be used to help provide free health insurance to all. Thus, while a\ntaxpayer's  _tax_  burden may increase, the idea is that their overall\nhousehold expenditures would presumably  _decrease_ , if the cost of\nhealthcare declines by more than the increase in the tax burden.\n\nThe difference between current law and Sanders' plan can be summarized like so\n(for a SINGLE taxpayer):\n\n**Income** | **Current Rate** | **Sanders Rate**  \n---|---|---  \n$0 - $9,525 | 10% | 10%  \n$9,526-$38,700 | 12% | 16%  \n$38,701-$82,500 | 22% | 26%  \n$82,501-$157,500 | 24% | 28%  \n$157,501-$200,000 | 32% | 36%  \n$200,001-$250,000 | 35% | 39%  \n$250,001-$500,000 | 35% | 44%  \n$500,001-$2,000,000 | 37% | 44%  \n$2,000,001-$10,000,000 | 37% | 54%  \nover $10,000,001 | 37% | 70%  \n  \nIn addition, it appears Sanders would retain the 3.8% net investment income\ntax, which would drive the top rate on interest or passive business income to\n73.8%.\n\n**Top Rate on Long-Term Capital Gains and Qualified Dividends**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**Long-term capital gains (think: the sale of stock held\nmore than one year) and qualified dividends are currently taxed at a high of\n20%, though most American's pay 15%, with those in the 10% and 12% brackets\npaying 0%. Of course, you have to tack on the aforementioned net investment\nincome tax of 3.8%, so the rate reaches a high of 23.8%.\n\n**_Sanders' Plan:  _**The rates would remain the same for those earning less\nthan $250,000, but for everyone in excess of that amount, capital gains and\ndividends would be taxed at the same ordinary rates reflected above, meaning\nthe rate could jump from a high of 23.8% to 73.8%. It is not clear, however,\nif the 4% surtax described above would apply to capital gains and dividends,\nso the rate could \"drop\" to 69.8%.\n\nThe treatment of capital gains is likely to be a huge talking point as 2020\nnears. On the one side, many [Republican\nsenators](https://www.atr.org/senator-cruz-leads-letter-urging-trump-admin-\nindex-capital-gains-taxes-inflation) are urging the President to further\nreduce the tax burden upon the sale of property by indexing the cost of that\nproperty for inflation. It makes economic sense: if you purchased stock in\n1978 for $100,000 and sell it today for $140,000, under current law, you've\ngot $40,000 of gain to deal with. But when you adjust the $100,000 you spent\nin 1970 for the impact of inflation over the past four decades, in real\ndollars, you LOST a boatload on that sale.\n\nThere are several hurdles the President would face in doing so, however,\nranging from legal questions over whether he has the authority in the absence\nof Congressional action to controversy over what other items in the tax law\nwould also need to be indexed in the name of fairness. The biggest problem,\nhowever, is one of  _optics_  given the public perception of the TCJA:\napproximately 85% of all capital gains are recognized by the wealthiest 2% of\ntaxpayers, meaning any unilateral reduction to capital gains taxation will be\nviewed by voters as one more gift to the rich. Fearing such a reaction,\nearlier this week President Trump tabled any further discussion of\nimplementing an indexing plan.\n\nThe Democrats, of course, have their own plans for capital gains, precisely\n_because  _85% of all gains belong to the rich. We will see that nearly every\ncandidate will follow Sanders' lead and greatly increase the preferential rate\non gains. But will it work? Because here's the thing about gain from sales of\nproperty as compared to income from wages --  _you_  control the timing of the\nincome. If the tax rate climbs too high, you simply don't sell the property.\nYou borrow against it, live off the debt proceeds, and wait until you die so\nyou can pass the property on to your heirs (more on stepped-up basis later).\n\nAs a result, Democrats will need to take a more ambitious approach if they\nintend to tap into the trillions of untapped capital gains throughout the\ncountry. To that end, Senator Ron Wyden -- who is NOT running for President\nbut who is in line to lead the Senate Finance Committee should Democrats take\nback that chamber in 2020, and thus would be a major force in designing tax\npolicy -- fired the opening salvo this week, publishing a report that\nrecommends \"mark-to-market\" taxation for the wealthiest taxpayers. Under such\na plan, those taxpayers would be required to value their holdings  _each and\nevery year_ , and pay tax on any net increase each year, regardless of whether\nthey sold the property.\n\nThe proposal is a departure from the long-standing principle that income must\nbe  _realized_  before it can be taxed, and like a wealth tax, poses serious\nadministrative and valuation challenges. Regardless of its viability, Wyden's\napproach reflects the line being drawn in the sand over the treatment of\ncapital gains, and from a broader perspective, the best way to tax the rich.\n\n**Payroll Taxes**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**If you earn money through wages or are self-employed, you\npay payroll taxes. In the employer-employee context, the employer and employee\nsplit a 12.4% tax on earnings up to the Social Security wage base, which in\n2019 is $132,900. For ALL wages, the employer and employee split a 2.9%\nMedicare tax. If you're self-employed, you're on the hook for the full 15.3%\n(though you do get to deduct half of the taxes on your return) unless, of\ncourse, you're smart enough to form an S corporation and take advantage of a\n60-year old opportunity in the law to avoid payroll taxes that we'll discuss\nshortly. Finally, as part of Obamacare, those who earn more than $250,000 (if\nmarried, $200,000 if single), are subject to an additional 0.9% payroll tax.\n\n_**Sanders' Plan:  **_As we will see throughout this exercise, the Democratic\ncandidates are not limiting their sources of additional tax revenue to the\nincome tax. Sanders, for example, would seek to ensure the ongoing solvency of\nSocial Security by requiring employers and employees to split the 12.4%\nMedicare tax  _again_  once earnings exceed $250,000. It's a steep price to\npay, but from my perspective, if paying more into Social Security makes it\neven 1% more likely that my parents won't be forced to move in with me because\ntheir funds died out, well, I\"m ready to do my part.\n\nIn addition, Sanders' plan would impose a  _new_  7.5% payroll tax on\nemployers. To protect small businesses, the first $2 million in wages paid\nwould be exempt from the tax.\n\n**Itemized Deductions**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**Taxpayer are entitled to deduct the greater of 1) the\nstandard deduction, or 2) the sum of the itemized deductions (things like\nmortgage interest, medical expenses, state and local income and property\ntaxes, and charitable contributions). The TCJA nearly doubled the standard\ndeduction (from $6,350 to $12,000 for single taxpayers, $12,700 to $24,000 for\nmarried couples), while limiting or eliminating certain itemized deductions, a\nconfluence of changes that decreased the number of filers who will itemize\nfrom 30% in 2017 to 11% in 2018.\n\nWhile certain itemized deductions are subject to limitation -- for example,\nthe deduction for state and local income and property taxes is capped at\n$10,000 -- there is no longer any _  overall limitation_ on a taxpayer's\nitemized deductions as there was prior to 2018.\n\n**_Sanders' Plan:  _**Sanders takes a page from a long-standing proposal by\nformer President Obama to cap the maximum benefit of itemized deductions at\n28%. Thus, under the Sanders proposal, a taxpayer could pay 73.8% on their\nlast dollar of income, but receive a deduction of only 28% on their last\ndollar of itemized deduction.\n\n**S Corporation Payroll Tax Opportunity**\n\n_**Current Law:  **_First things first: it's not a \"loophole.\" It's just the\nlaw. It's been this way for 60 years.\n\nBack in 1959, the IRS stated that income earned by shareholders of an S\ncorporation is not considered self employment tax for purposes of the 15.3% in\npayroll taxes we discussed above. As a result, if you operate a business, you\nhave a choice:\n\nFirst, you can operate a business directly, without an S corporation, and say\nyou earn $2 million...all of the income will be subject to self-employment\ntax; the first $132,900 at 12.4%, and the full $2 million taxed at 2.9%.\n\nOr.....you could set up an S corporation, have the $2 million paid to the\ncorporation, and pay yourself a $100,000 salary. You'll pay 15.3% on the\n$100,000 salary, but the remaining $1.9 million can be distributed to you\nwithout the imposition of payroll taxes. Not a bad deal.\n\nOf course, the IRS can argue that your $100,000 salary was not high enough,\nand recharacterize some of your distributions to income and collect the\npayroll tax. But pay yourself \"reasonable compensation\" and the rest comes out\nwithout payroll taxes; not by virtue of a sneaky \"loophole,\" but rather a\nwell-worn and widely-known subtlety of the law.\n\n**_Sanders' Plan:  _**Sanders plan would subject all S corporation income to\nself-employment tax, though it does not state that in any coherent fashion. As\nwith the 28% maximum benefit of itemized deductions, this is a change that was\nlong-proposed by former President Obama -- and even made a brief appearance in\nthe House bill that eventually became the TCJA -- but has yet to become law.\n\n**Estate Tax**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**When you die, if the value of your assets exceeds a\nthreshold, an estate tax is due. The TCJA increased the exemption amount to\n$11.4 million ($22.8 million for a married couple), with any excess subject to\na 40% rate. When your assets are passed through the estate to the beneficiary,\nthe beneficiary takes the assets with a \"stepped-up basis\" equal to their fair\nmarket value. Thus, if they were to receive an appreciated building worth $10\nmillion and sell it the next day for that price, no gain would arise.\n\n_**Sanders' Plan:  **_Sanders has long itched to take aim at the estate tax.\nHis latest plan calls for 45% on assets valued between $3.5 million and $10\nmillion, 50% on assets valued between $10 million and $50 million, 55% on\nassets valued between $50 million and $1 billion, and 77% on any value in\nexcess of $1 billion  (all thresholds doubled for married couples). In\naddition, Sanders would eliminate the \"stepped-up basis\" rule upon death. More\nspecifically, death would become a realization even, meaning the deceased\nwould pay tax on the appreciation at the time of death. This would accelerate\ncollection of the tax when compared to simply eliminating the step-up, as the\nIRS won't have to wait for the heirs to sell the assets to tax the gain.\n\n**Corporate Tax**\n\n**_Current Law:  _**The hallmark of the TCJA was the reduction in the\ncorporate rate from 35% to 21%. That's a 40% decrease, which definitely didn't\nhelp the narrative that the bill was largely a giveaway to Big Business.\n\n_**Sanders' Plan:  **_Oddly enough, Sanders has not formally stated his\npreference for the corporate rate, though rumors are he would favor a return\nto the 35% rate in place in 2017.\n\n**What's New and Different?  **\n\nFor each candidate, we'll take a look at something they are proposing that is\noutside the realm of the normal tax rate increase or limit on deductions. Come\nto think of it, for some candidates, EVERYTHING might be new and different. In\nthe case of Sanders, aside from surcharges and employer-side payroll tax\nincreases, he would embrace the once-taboo notion of an annual wealth tax.\n\nIt would work a bit like the estate tax, only you don't have to be dead to pay\nit, so if there's a silver lining to be found, that's it. Each year, similar\nto Wyden's mark-to-market tax, your net worth will be computed -- using a\nmethod and manner that absolutely no one has contemplated to this point. If\nthe value of your assets at the end of the year exceeds the following\nthresholds (they don't), you would pay the corresponding tax on the excess:\n\n**Value of Assets** | **Rate**  \n---|---  \n$32-$50 million | 1%  \n$50 - $250 million | 2%  \n$250-$500 million | 3%  \n$500 million - $1 billion | 4%  \n$1 billion - $2.5 billion | 5%  \n$2.5 billion -$5 billion | 6%  \n$5 billion - $10 billion | 7%  \nover $10 billion | 8%  \n  \nAs mentioned briefly in the introduction, the problems with a wealth tax are\nmany, starting with the administrative hassle of valuing assets alluded to\nabove. The bigger issue, however, is there is doubt as to whether a wealth tax\nis constitutional under Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4, which provides that\nany \"direct tax\" -- a term that has remaining undefined since the late 1700's\nand thus has caused no shortage of constitutional consternation -- must be\nallocated among the states in accordance with the relative population. Because\nthis wealth tax would most certainly NOT be allocated among the states, but\nrather would be imposed directly on each individual,  _if  _it were be\ndetermined to be a direct tax, it would not be constitutional. This is a\nfascinating issue; one I've spent far too much time researching over the past\nfew months, and one that I'm itching to write an article about. But have you\never read the comments section on ANY article interpreting the constitution?\nThere are hordes of people who have devoted their life to understanding every\nword on that parchment, and they like nothing more than to tell you how wrong\nyou are when your interpretation differs from theirs. Hard pass.\n\nWe'll revisit the wealth tax issue when we get to Elizabeth Warren, because\nhers is quite a bit more ambitious than Sanders'.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAll told, Sanders' plan would raise in excess of $16  _trillion  _in revenue\nover the next ten years. By way of comparison, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was\nslated to  _reduce_  revenue by $1.5 trillion. So this is a plan of a much\nhigher order of magnitude, but when you're offering the types of social\nprograms that are the foundation of the Sanders platform, that money has to\ncome from somewhere. It will be interesting to see how the cost of Sanders'\nplan compares to the other candidates' plans, but for that...we'll have to\nwait until next time.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nittiaj).\n\n[![Tony\nNitti](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/400x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-\nimages.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5dead873e961e100078f5b13%2F960x0.jpg%3FcropX1%3D0%26cropX2%3D225%26cropY1%3D0%26cropY2%3D225)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/\n\"Photo of Tony Nitti\")\n\n[Tony Nitti](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/)\n\nI am a Tax Partner with RubinBrown in Aspen, Colorado.

[+] 8th Avenue, Monday, October 2, 2006 in New York.\nPhotographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News.\n\nBLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nThe stereotypical company culture of today\u2019s top tech companies is modeled\nafter Google.\n\nIn an effort to woo the best and the brightest in the workforce, Google\ndistinguished itself from the \u201cboring\u201d corporate world, offering benefits\nunseen at any employer. In some offices, employees can take advantage of\ncomplimentary child care, indulge in a free lunch at the cafeteria or hitch a\nride in a company-provided shuttle.\n\nBut not every Google employee has this experience. An internal\n[document](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-\nworkers.html) reviewed by the New York Times showed Google employs about\n121,000 temporary, vendor and contract workers (TVCs) globally. This is while\nthe company has 102,000 full-time employees, as of March. The Times found\nthese employees are typically paid lower and have less comprehensive benefits\npackages than full-time staff. These roles span across all departments of the\ncompany, from chefs to coders.\n\nThe reality is the company is merely following a growing trend of tech\nemployers opting to hire contractors over full-time employees. The Times\narticle included an estimate from staffing platform OnContracting, saying most\ntechnology firms used contract workers for 40 to 50 percent of their staff.\nAccording to an NPR/Marist poll\n[conducted](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/578825135/rise-of-the-contract-\nworkers-work-is-different-now) in 2018, contractors currently make up about 20\npercent of the labor market, with a prediction that contract workers could\nmake up half of the American workforce within a decade.\n\nToday In: [AI & Big Data](https://www.forbes.com/ai-big-data)\n\n  * [\n\n### A Feminist Future Begins By Banning Killer Robots\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noelsharkey/2020/03/08/a-feminist-future-\nbegins-by-banning-killer-robots/)\n\n  * [\n\n### AI In Policing: Better Than \u2018A Knife Through The Chest?\u2019\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noelsharkey/2020/03/06/ai-in-policing-better-\nthan-a-knife-through-the-chest/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Why Smart Closets Are Stupid\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceyfollows/2020/01/20/why-smart-closets-are-\nstupid/)\n\nGoogle employees hold signs during a walkout to protest how the tech giant\nhandled sexual misconduct... [+] in Mountain View, California, U.S., on\nThursday, Nov. 1, 2018. The mass walkout was sparked by a recent New York\nTimes report that claimed Google gave millions of dollars to some executives\nin secret exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\nPhotographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg\n\n\u00a9 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nOne example: Joseph Lawlor, the co-founder of [Digital\nDynasty](https://digitaldynastymarketing.com/), a Las Vegas-based SEO\nmarketing agency. He said he has only hired contract employees to work at his\ngrowing company.\n\n\u201cWe have yet to hire full-time employees because we're still in a growth stage\nwhere the funds can be placed into client acquisition and systems building,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nThere are some differences in how companies hire contract workers. For\ninstance, Lawlor pays his employees as 1099 independent contractors. In this\nclassification, workers are responsible for their own payroll tax obligations,\nwith no responsibility for the employer to offer benefits or even provide\nsupplies.\n\nSome contract workers are \u201cpermanent\u201d W2 employees for the staffing firms that\nrecruit them. From there, employees are assigned to do work for other larger\ncompanies. These agencies typically make a profit off of this practice,\n[often](https://www.humanresourcesmba.net/faq/how-much-do-owners-of-staffing-\nagencies-earn/) by taking a cut of the worker\u2019s salary, charging employers a\nflat fee or both. These contracts are typically temporary (Google's time limit\nfor contract employees is reportedly two years) and are on an \"at-will\" basis,\nmeaning the employee or employer can end the job at any time, for any reason.\n\nSome of these agencies may offer benefits to contractors but are often not the\nperks offered to full-time employees. Angela Rochester, an assistant general\ncounsel and human resources consultant for [Engage\nPEO](https://www.engagepeo.com/), suggested Google may be more incentivized to\nhire TVCs because of the cost savings from having to contribute to employee\nhealth and pension plans. OnContracting\n[suggested](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-\nworkers.html) that technology companies may be saving $100,000 per year on\neach American job by hiring a contractor versus a full-time employee.\n\nRochester said one of the benefits of working with a staffing agency is that\nit allows businesses to adjust to varying fluctuations in workload. It may\neven offer companies an opportunity to trial employees they may want to add to\ntheir permanent staff.\n\n\u201cIn certain situations, companies can use temporary workers to determine\nwhether or not the company wants to extend an offer for full-time employment\nto the worker. These arrangements may not always work for every company, but\nfor some, it may be a great opportunity to get hands-on experience before\nfilling a position,\u201d she said.\n\nAn illuminated Google LLC logo sits on a reception desk inside the tech\ngiant's office in Berlin,... [+] Germany, on Wednesday, May 29, 2019. Google\nChief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai turned down a big new grant of\nrestricted stock in 2018 because he felt he was already paid generously,\naccording to a person familiar with the decision. Photographer: Krisztian\nBocsi/Bloomberg\n\n\u00a9 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nThis may be true for Lawlor. While he currently employees a staff of seven\ncontractors, the ultimate goal for him is to bring his team on-board\npermanently.\n\n\u201cAll in all, we'd love to reward our employees with full-time schedules and\nbenefits, and it'll happen soon - but for now we have to use our resources to\ngrow our company the best way possible,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it may make sense to hire a contractor for short-term projects or to\nsave money for a specific period of time, Marissa Geist, COO of\n[Cielo](https://www.cielotalent.com/), a recruitment process outsourcing\nprovider, said it may ultimately be an unwise decision.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, there is no substitute for engaged, effective, long-\nterm talent,\" she said. \"Despite the potential cost savings that a contractor\ncan provide, if you fail to make contractors feel engaged and connected to\nyour company, the drag on culture and momentum can actually be more costly\nthan the immediate savings that contractors bring in the short term.\u201d\n\nRochester agrees that a \u201ctransient\u201d workforce could contribute to the loss of\nmorale at a company.\n\n\u201cSometimes temporary workers feel like outsiders and regular employees may not\nbe inclined to get to know a temporary worker if the temporary worker is going\nto leave,\u201d she said.\n\nThis was a common complaint from a group of Google employees who protested to\nadvocate for higher pay and better benefits for the company\u2019s contract\nworkers,\n[describing](https://twitter.com/GoogleWalkout/status/1110990194390589442?s=20)\nthe company\u2019s employee base as a \u201ctwo-tier system that treats some workers as\nexpendable.\u201d\n\nSince then, Google has\n[committed](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/4/18293900/google-contractors-benefits-\npolicy) to expanding benefits to contract employees, mandating that its\nstaffing firms offer comprehensive health care coverage, paid sick leave and\nparental leave and tuition reimbursement.\n\nBut still, the gap remains, as Google's contract workers look for more\nequality in the workplace. For instance, Google TVCs are not allowed to\nparticipate in company all-hands meetings or allowed to attend company job\nfairs. Google did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPaul Pellman, a former Google employee and now CEO of people management\nsolution [Kazoo](https://www.kazoohr.com/), said Google can create a better\nwork environment for its contract staff by over-communicating and making sure\nall employees are engaged and valued, regardless of employment status.\n\n\u201cContract workers may have different needs than full-time employees, but that\ndoesn't mean the way you engage them should change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important\nto listen to contract employees, hear what they have to say, get to know them\nboth personally and professionally, and provide them with what they need to do\ntheir jobs effectively.\u201d\n\n[![Johan\nMoreno](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/400x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-\nimages.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5e4dfd15d378190007f3e17d%2F960x0.jpg%3FcropX1%3D0%26cropX2%3D427%26cropY1%3D105%26cropY2%3D532)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/\n\"Photo of Johan Moreno\")\n\n[Johan Moreno](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/)\n\nI\u2019m a contributing writer for Forbes covering Google and Alphabet.

Communicating with telegrams and not smartphones\n  2. Making trade by barter system and not Digital wallets and Cryptocurrencies (a work-in-progress though)\n  3. Using hand-painted portraits for pictures instead of AR-powered snapchat filters, among other things.\n\nThanks to human curiosity, we evolved and developed with time and created\ntechnology. Result? Now, technology is evolving us - ironic, right?\n\nSince technology has hit almost all the industries in its wake, the Finance\nand Banking industry is not excluded from the picture. Hence, the birth of the\nFintech industry.\n\nOver the years, the Fintech industry has seen many changes brought by\ndifferent technologies, facilitating the whole working process more and more.\n\n**_So, why don\u2019t we catch up on what\u2019s hot in the Fintech?_**\n\nI.e., What are the Fintech trends to look forward to in 2020 and beyond?\nSomething you must be familiar with since [Fintech can have numerous effects\non your business in 2020](https://appinventiv.com/blog/impact-of-fintech-on-\nyour-business/).\n\nIf you are also worked up like us, then sit back while we reveal all\nfascinating 20 Fintech trends for 2020 that will become huge and will continue\nto disrupt the industry, if they haven\u2019t done so in 2019.\n\n### 1\\. Open Banking\n\nOne of the top banking and fintech trends for 2020 and beyond has to be Open\nbanking. It leverages [APIs](https://appinventiv.com/blog/complete-guide-to-\napi-development/) that allow third-party developers to develop apps and\nservices around the financial institution, in order to help users enjoy the\nonline banking service via multiple platforms.\n\nAmong many, some of the advantages of open banking and the reason why it is\ndeemed to become prominent are - increased [customer\nexperience](https://appinventiv.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-customer-\nexperience/), innovative service models, better revenue streams for\nbusinesses, etc.\n\n{[Learn how open banking APIs are being used in the fintech\nindustry](https://appinventiv.com/blog/use-of-apis-in-fintech/)}\n\n### **2\\. Voice Search in banking apps**\n\nThe fact that by 2020, almost[ 50% of all searches will be voice-\nbased](https://www.comscore.com/) on the internet, is enough to give you a\nhint of Fintech\u2019s future in 2020 and the role it is playing in transforming\nthe banking and finance sector. Voice-based search in banking software will\nassist customers in easily accessing banking services, provide ways of\nencryption while supporting communication with NLP-powered voice assistants.\n\n{While we are on this topic, we suggest you also have a look at our article\n\u201c[How Can Google Voice Assistant App Make Your Business\nEfficient?](https://appinventiv.com/blog/google-voice-assistant-app-\ndevelopment/)\u201d}\n\nMore and more industries and banking institutions are adopting the voice\nsearch- one of the latest fintech technologies, and why wouldn\u2019t they when it\ncan[ save up to $3 billion](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-\nservices/library/pdf/pwc-voice-banking.pdf).\n\n### **3\\. Blockchain on banking software**\n\n![Blockchain market in fintech](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/Blockchain-market-in-fintech.png)\n\n[Blockchain](https://appinventiv.com/blog/basics-of-blockchain-infographic/)\nis not called a disruptive technology for no reason. It has become\nunprecedentedly popular in just a few years. As a matter of fact, financial\nservices organizations are raising investments to catch up with blockchain\ninnovations. Moreover, 77% of these companies are waiting to see the live\nproduction systems by the year 2020.\n\nThe above graph shows the incessantly growing blockchain technology in the\nfintech market and is predicted to grow at a high CAGR.\n\n{Bonus: [What is The Impact of Blockchain on Fintech? [Complete\nGuide]](https://appinventiv.com/blog/blockchain-and-fintech/)}\n\nSome of the [decentralized financial\ntechnologies](https://appinventiv.com/blog/decentralized-finance-defi-guide/)\nderived from Blockchain are proving to be highly useful in the banking and\nfinance industry and setting up trends for the year 2020. Let\u2019s have a look.\n\n  * #### **Smart contracts**\n\nWithout a doubt, a boon for the finance industry,[ Smart contracts\n](https://appinventiv.com/blog/smart-contract-guide/)(a decentralized\nfinancial technology) are quickly gaining popularity. They are an evolution of\npen and paper contracts - more effective, more secure, and of course,\nimmutable. Wonder how they work? Let\u2019s take an example-\n\nIn smart contracts, parties sign smart contact by using cryptographic keys\n(digital signature as you will). Now, instead of using pen and paper, the\ncontracts are encoded in computer language. And these codes are virtually\ntamper-proof, hence immutable contracts.\n\n  * #### **Crypto-To-Cash Conversions**\n\n[Cryptocurrencies](https://appinventiv.com/blog/cryptocurrencies-market-\ntrends/) are becoming more prominent every day and institutional investors are\nexpected to show their interest in cryptocurrency adoption. And this all is a\nresult of new initiatives that have emerged to increase their real-world\nimplications. New advancements may surface in 2020 targeting crypto-to-cash\ndifficulty and may give us what we are looking for.\n\nIn fact, many digital-only banks or the banks collaborating with Fintech are\nalready actively considering the possibility of cryptocurrency implementation\nin order to perform money operations.\n\n### **4\\. AI and ML-powered chatbots and automated customer services**\n\n![Market size of AI in the\nFintech](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/Market-size-of-AI-in-the-Fintech.png)\n\nA generally accepted statement - AI is our past, present, and future clearly\nshows how humongous this technology is going to be, changing the face of every\nindustry, including Finance and banking. As per [AI technology\ntrends](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-technology-trends/), the market size\nof AI in the Fintech market is predicted to increase from [$959.3 million in\n2016 to $7305.6 million by 2022](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-\nReports/ai-in-fintech-market-34074774.html), at a CAGR of 40.4%.\n\n![QUOTE 1 ](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/QUOTE-1-2.png)\n\n  * #### **Chatbots**\n\nThese are increasingly becoming a choice of financial institutions for\ncustomer support services. You ask why? Well, these\n[chatbots](https://appinventiv.com/blog/how-chatbot-shaping-business-growth/)\nare available to the customer 24X7 without incurring additional monthly\nexpenses. They leverage the advancements of ML algorithms and NLP (natural\nlanguage processing) to serve customers in all possible ways.\n\nAnother thing is that [chatbots are incredible for enhancing customer\nengagement](https://appinventiv.com/blog/chatbots-building-customer-\nengagement/). Some of the chatbots used by popular banks worldwide are Ceba\n(Commonwealth Bank Australia), Erica (Bank of America), and Eva (HDFC Bank).\n\n  * #### **Robotic process automation (RPA)**\n\nIt is the new Fintech trend that would become major in 2020. The bot is\ndesigned to maintain records and transactions, execute calculations and do\ntasks that involve resolving queries. What is more, in instances where\n[RPA](https://modernanalyst.com/Community/CommunityBlog/tabid/182/ID/5526/RPA-\nand-Chatbots-Two-Intersecting-Parts-of-AI.aspx) cannot entirely automate the\nprocess, it surely frees up the time and enables you to focus on other\nprominent things and operations to facilitate clients.\n\n  * #### **Customer Intelligence**\n\nAI-based customer intelligence is something financial bodies are gaining more\nand more interest in. It is because customer intelligence helps these\ninstitutions to have a deeper understanding of users through their banking\nrelationships and transactions by analyzing data gathered via technology. Some\norganizations have already started implementing it in their analysis process\nwhile many will follow suit in 2020, making it a notable Fintech trend for\n2020.\n\n  * #### **Regulators using AI to predict potential issues**\n\nSince we are about to hit 2020, we may encounter changes in the way regulators\nperform certain actions. Since AI is prominent as of now, they are bound to\nturn to AI\u2019s algorithm, data gathering, and analytics tools to compare\nscenarios and predict probable issues and risks.\n\n### **5\\. Mobile apps**\n\nNot as surprising as others, mobile apps are also gaining popularity in the\nfintech industry and have proved potent for becoming a trend. With the\nincessantly growing popularity of mobile apps, many fintech companies have\nstarted to tie up with [fintech app development\ncompanies](https://appinventiv.com/finance-app-development/) in order to\ncreate impeccable digital solutions. There are all kinds of innovations\nwaiting around the corner which we will see throughout this year.\n\n### **6\\. Co-browsing**\n\nThe screen-sharing is generally the function where one party gives access to\nanother party for sharing the device\u2019s screen. With the help of co-browsing,\nusers will be able to prevent others from gaining complete access to the\ndevice. Instead, it lets users share a particular web page with another party\nfor mutual access. Something that is a boon for the finance and banking\nsector, as it is very useful in banking software.\n\nWith co-browsing intuition, representatives can easily assist customers with\nissues pertaining to the completion of bank formalities and documentation, to\nname a few. This is what makes it an emerging trend in finance.\n\n### **7\\. Next-Gen Digital-Only Banks**\n\nA rapid increase has been witnessed in partnerships among Fintech companies\nand banking institutions, promoting the emergence of new financial\nintermediaries. Now, Digital-only banks are gaining unprecedented popularity,\nsomething that was not anticipated in this decade at least.\n\nWith an additional time economy option, these Digital-only banks offer an even\nmore diverse array of services to their customers. No wonder, Digital-only\nbanking is going to become huge in 2020 because of its connection with\ndisrupting technology like Blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\n### **8\\. Digital Wallets**\n\nDigital Wallets are effectively on a way to eradicate fiat money from the\nwallets. In fact, in a [report ](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-\nrelease/mobile-wallet-market-to-reach-5250-billion-globally-by-2020-says-\nallied-market-research-2019-07-23)by Market Watch, it was revealed that the\ndigital wallet market size was valued to be $16,650 million in 2013, something\nthat is predicted to reach $ 5,250 billion by the year 2020 at a growing CAGR\nof 127.5%. Alone in 2018, the number of digital-wallet users was 440 million\nand has surely increased in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020. To\nsupport this statement, look at the graph below depicting the rise in wallet\nusers.\n\n![Digital wallet users\nworldwide](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/Digital-wallet-users-worldwide.png)\n\n{Read: [Mobile Wallets: Best Way to Serve Customer Engagement Via Several\nWays](https://appinventiv.com/blog/mobile-wallets-best-way-serve-customer-\nengagement-via-several-ways/)}\n\nBecause of this trend, almost all organizations have integrated it into their\nbusiness. Moreover, many financial institutions are taking advantage of\nblockchain and crypto technologies, expected to make bets in 2020 on ICOs\nalong with the Asian market arena.\n\n### **9\\. Cybersecurity combating Cyber Threats**\n\nSince everything is online now, there is a [rapidly increasing threat of\ncybercrimes](https://www.comparitech.com/vpn/cybersecurity-cyber-crime-\nstatistics-facts-trends/), something which all financial institutions, among\nothers want to avoid at any cost. In this case, there have been many\nadvancements in this segment developing robust security systems to creating\nnext-gen tools for data protection.\n\nCyber risk analytics has also merged to be an interesting implementation of AI\nin Fintech to detect probably threats. With what we have witnessed so far in\n2019, it is without a doubt that improving the cybersecurity is going to be\none of the top Fintech trends in 2020.\n\n### **10\\. Big Data**\n\nBig Data is still a fairly new concept. However, the combination of Fintech\nand Big Data can be anticipated to become a major Fintech trend in 2020.\nInstitutions are gradually coming to terms with this technology and trying to\nfind a way to implement it.\n\nBig data is helpful in many ways, i.e., develop protective strategies,\npersonalized finance field promoting both clients\u2019 comfort and organizations\u2019\ninterests in service advertising or data gathering, customer segmentation,\nfraud detection, risk management, among other things.\n\n### **11\\. Asian Market**\n\nThe Asian market is rapidly becoming the biggest adopter of Fintech. As new\nFintech companies start to emerge, we can expect great advances in the Asian\nmarket.\n\n![Consumer FinTech Adoption Across Various\nMarkets](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/Consumer-FinTech-Adoption-Across-Various-\nMarkets.png)\n\nOn analyzing the events of 2019, it was noted that China has emerged to be the\nglobal leader in the Fintech industry. With the world\u2019s biggest population,\nthe country has 800 million internet users - a combined percentage of\ncountries like Mexico, Japan, Russia, and the US.\n\n### **12\\. On-demand Insurance**\n\nThe on-demand model has become one of the most in-trend concepts of this\ndecade and will continue to do so in the coming one. In fact, [on-demand\nmobile app economy statistics](https://appinventiv.com/blog/on-demand-mobile-\napp-economy-statistics/) are legit proof of its popularity.\n\nJust like you can get a taxi on-demand via [apps like Careem and\nUber](https://appinventiv.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-app-\nlike-careem-uber/), you can also avail insurance in a matter of minutes.\nFinancial institutions have started to offer insurance facilities via mobile\napps. Customers can easily apply insurance for real estate, car, and other\nbelongings, simplifying and making the whole process more efficient.\n\n### **13\\. Fintech Regulation**\n\nRegulation is a salient aspect of the Fintech industry, becoming one of the\nlargest businesses that are overhead expenses. In the industry, there are\nstill many regulation compliance tasks and processes that depend on manual\naction or at least involve human oversight.\n\nBecause of the recent advancements in the industry, we won\u2019t be wrong to\nexpect more regulation technology solutions to be introduced in 2020, aiming\nto streamline all processes and reducing expenses.\n\n### **14\\. Growing Chinese Fintech Ecosystem**\n\nThe Chinese fintech ecosystem is based on already existing and engaging\ncustomer platforms. The industry giants, that have to build this ecosystem,\ntarget users that are already using specific platforms. For instance, Ant\nFinancial is built on the support of Alibaba e-Commerce platform, offering\nnumerous B2C solutions like Alipay for online transactions. This tactic has\nproved to be beneficial for many organizations and is expected to\nsignificantly influence the world\u2019s fintech technologies trends.\n\n### **15\\. Partnerships and collaborations are on a rise**\n\nPartnerships and mergers among fintech companies are going to be one of the\ntop fintech trends for 2020, according to [Kathleen\nCraig](https://twitter.com/KathleenECraig?lang=en), founder, and CEO of HT\nMobile Apps (a fintech company). Startups and small organizations are coming\nto the realization that partnerships are more profitable.\n\nMore so, till now direct-to-customer fintech companies have been stuck on a\nparticular piece of the market, but with these mergers, we can see a whole new\nspectrum of services they together may offer.\n\n### **16\\. Sharing economy will become integral**\n\nWhat started with cars, taxis, hotel rooms, etc.will now expand its horizons\nto include financial services. The sharing economy is expected to become a\nhuge Fintech trend for 2020.\n\nHere, the sharing economy pertains to decentralized asset ownership and the\nuse of IT to obtain suitable matches between providers and users of capital,\ninstead of turning to a bank as an intermediary element.\n\n### **17\\. Public cloud to become major infrastructure model**\n\nEven now, many financial institutions seek help from cloud-computing for an\narray of work and processes. They use cloud-based SaaS apps for things that\nmay be deemed non-core like HR, CRM, and accounting. The core service\ninfrastructures in areas including consumer payments, credit scoring, and\nstatements are going to become utilities by 2020.\n\n### ![QUOTE 2 ](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/QUOTE-2-2.png)**18\\. Increase in \u2018A\u2019 rated\nLife Insurance Carriers**\n\nAnother Fintech trend for 2020 related to insurance is the \u2018A\u2019 rated life\ninsurance carriers. Now, the institutions will employ technology in a way as\nto eliminate the medical exam while simplifying the writing and underwriting\nof a new life insurance policy.\n\nSome of the fintech startups are implementing up to $1 million of term\ncoverage without any medical exam and only refer to the data collected on\ncustomers regarding the prescription history based on their medical\nquestionnaire for passing approval.\n\n### **19\\. Using Fintech for protection**\n\n### ![QUOTE 3 ](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2020/01/QUOTE-3-2.png)**20\\. Traditional payroll\ndisruption**\n\nBecause of the existing problems faced by people with respect to the payroll\nprocess, technology has been again placed at the forefront to resolve the\nprevailing issues.\n\nWith the help of fintech companies, other organizations are improving the\ntraditional ways of payroll. Companies such as [Gusto](https://gusto.com/),\nwhich has been valued at $3.8 billion, have introduced a flexible Pay feature\nthat allows employees to pick a date to receive their payroll. Another example\nat hand is the [Earnin](https://www.earnin.com/) app allowing users to get\naccess to their earnings before their scheduled payday.\n\nNow that 2020 has arrived, it is going to be a ride watching these fintech\ntechnologies trends gain popularity and give birth to other trends that may or\nmay not have been anticipated.\n\n_Technology is a Pandora 's box, so let\u2019s see what else it has in its store\nfor the year 2020 and beyond._\n\n![Prateek Saxena](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/1/2019/12/prateek-150x150.png)\n\nPrateek Saxena\n\nCo-founder of Appinventiv\n\n[__Let's connect!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateeksaxena123/)\n\nIn search for strategic sessions?.\n\nLet us understand your business thoroughly and help you  \nstrategies your digital product..\n\n[ Book a session _\u2192_ ](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [AR/VR Trends and Predictions for 2020 & Beyond](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ar-vr-trends/ \"AR/VR Trends and Predictions for 2020 & Beyond\")\n* [52+ Striking Snapchat Statistics and Facts (2019-2020)](https://appinventiv.com/blog/snapchat-app-statistics/ \"52+ Striking Snapchat Statistics and Facts \\(2019-2020\\)\")\n* [Artificial Intelligence: The Tech Trend that is Transforming the Healthcare Industry](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-transforming-healthcare/ \"Artificial Intelligence: The Tech Trend that is Transforming the Healthcare Industry\")\n\n[ ![Appinventiv Technologies -

R. Ambedkar**_\n\nThe fate of a nation is directly linked to the state of its women. You educate\na woman \u2013 you educate her family. You create opportunities for women \u2013 you see\nan entire community prosper. The higher a woman rises, the better it is for\nthe entire ecosystem, because when women thrive, they, more than men, act as\nrole models for others.\n\nYet, for long women have been struggling to be recognized and valued, both\npersonally and in workplaces. And while corporate India may not be able to\neffect change for women at home, we can definitely do wonders for them at\nwork. Research has shown time and again that gender balance fosters creativity\nand innovation, boosts employee morale and eventually leads to better business\nresults. For organisations that want long-term growth, creating a supportive,\nempowering space to attract and engage women is essential.\n\nEqual pay for equal work is the basic - to truly empower women and entice them\nto the workplace, there is a need to look at women\u2019s lives holistically. A\nwoman plays several roles to help the society evolve. Hence, she needs to be\narmed with the right tools to help her in this journey.\n[Sodexo,](https://solutions.sodexobenefitsindia.com/multi-benefits-\npass?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=MBP) with decades of\nexperience across the globe and regular [gender\nbalance](https://www.sodexo.com/inspired-thinking/research-and-reports/gender-\nbalance-study-2018.html) studies, has implemented several measures to enhance\nQuality of Life of women at workplaces. It has also been privy to best\npractices from organisations across the globe that foster the growth of its\nwomen.\n\nFlexibility with empathy is key. Research says that around 25% of millennials\nare Sandwichers - individuals who take care of their parents as well as\nchildren. This is a hectic life especially for women, since they are often the\nprimary care-givers. Flexi-work that is truly flexible is a life-saver for\nthem. So, a location/time-agnostic culture where they can work from any place,\nany time, without it affecting their chances of growth, is important. Some\norganisations offer employee assistance programs, [concierge services, office\ntransport and better medical facilities, all in an effort to smoothen lives of\ntheir female employees.](https://solutions.sodexobenefitsindia.com/multi-\nbenefits-pass?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=MBP)\n\nMost organisations have a 3-6-month maternity/adoption leave policies. Some\nhave a flexible maternity/adoption leave policy which implies need-based\nextension of the leave, topped up with flexi working for a certain duration.\nOffering a safe and modern creche/baby-sitting facility, nursing rooms, option\nof getting the baby to work when needed \u2013 all go a long way in winning women\u2019s\n(and men\u2019s) hearts.\n\nShare if you care \u2013 through voluntary leave transfers. It\u2019s a fact that some\npeople might need more personal time than others. So, while some exhaust all\ntheir leaves and may need more for medical or personal emergencies, others may\nnot use them all. A leave transfer policy that will allow employees to\ntransfer their unused leave to those more in need is a win-win that has been\nimplemented in organisations in India and abroad.\n\nIncrease the female talent pipeline. Nothing motivates the younger generation\nof women more than seeing a large number of senior women who are happy in\ntheir jobs \u2013 this gives them a sense of self-belief and faith in the\norganisations. In fact, a 2016 study by Mercer was clear that \u2018failure to\nbuild talent pipeline threatens women\u2019s workplace progress\u2019. So, coach, mentor\nand retrain women so they can reinvent themselves and re-map their career.\n\nSodexo\u2019s Women Work network in the UK and Ireland, for example, supports\ncareer development for women and works to achieve gender balance in the\ncompany. It organizes a range of mixed-gender events to help women share good\npractice, build their contacts and get involved in charitable activities.\nHelping women live a second innings is also a great enabler. The percentage of\ngifted women who leave the workforce due to personal commitments is extremely\nhigh. Yet, there are very few organisations that have understood the power of\nattracting women for a second innings. If you create special job profiles that\nwill tempt more women to come back to work, be it consulting, contract, part-\ntime, flexi-time or even project-based, you will entice more younger women as\nwell.\n\n[Mercer\u2019s report](https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/when-women-thrive.html)\nreiterated that \u2018Women are perceived to have unique skills needed in today\u2019s\nmarket, including flexibility and adaptability, inclusive team management and\nemotional intelligence Sodexo\u2019s Gender Balance Study of 2018 found that the\nkey performance indicators of organizations are substantially higher when they\nhave a better gender - balanced team. Covering 50,000 managers across 100\nentities worldwide, the study showed that operating margins, client and\nemployee retention, employee engagement and safety showed an upward trend for\norganisations where women had 40-60% representation.

By removing the cap\nholds for Deonte Burton, Hamidou Diallo and Abdel Nader, that number grows to\n$15.3 million (just removing the holds on Burton and Nader gets them to $13.7\nmillion). The Thunder can get to nearly $25 million in space if Jerami Grant\nopts out of his $9.3 million player option, and OKC could also decline\nTerrance Ferguson's $3.9 million team option to reach $28.5 million in room.\nIt would also leave them with just four players under contract: Westbrook,\nAdams, Schroder and Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nThat would give the Thunder the ability offer a max contract ($27.5) to a\nplayer with less than six years experience (think D'Angelo Russell this\nsummer), but they would still be a good distance away from the max space\nneeded ($33) to sign a player with 7-9 years experience (think Kyrie Irving,\nKevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler).\n\nThe root issue is Westbrook, Adams and Schroder are scheduled to make $84.4\nmillion combined during the 2020-21 season. If you add in Grant, Ferguson and\nGilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder have about $101.7 million committed to five\nplayers, with the cap expected to land around $117 million.\n\nEmail Sign up\n\n### Like

on July 8, 2019._\n\nThere is only one appropriate reward for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team upon\ntheir return home as the winners of back-to-back World Cup championships:\nequal pay. If the U.S. Soccer Federation wants to win another, it has to stop\nunderpaying its banner team.\n\nThe USWNT is set to enter mediation with the federation when they return from\nFrance, after bringing [a gender-discrimination\nlawsuit](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/why-the-us-\nnational-womens-soccer-team-is-\nsuing/585202/?utm_source=twitter&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_campaign=the-\natlantic&utm_medium=social&utm_term=2019-03-19T14%3A12%3A12) in March. The\nlawsuit stated that they are paid far less than the men\u2019s team, in some cases\nearning just 38 percent of pay per game. This team has shown that [they won\u2019t\nback down](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/us-\nwomens-soccer-must-win/593161/), on or off the pitch, until they get what they\ndeserve. And with yet another Cup trophy on their shelf, they\u2019ve more than\nproved that they are worth as much\u2014if not more\u2014as the men\u2019s national team,\nwhich failed to even qualify for the World Cup last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tough matches the United States had to play to earn this\ntitle prove that the days of winning a championship without the federation\u2019s\nequal investment are numbered. With multiple soccer powerhouses\u2014especially [in\nEurope](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/investment-pays-off-as-\neurope-dominates-womens-world-\ncup/2019/06/26/8bbbbb08-9849-11e9-9a16-dc551ea5a43b_story.html?utm_term=.7a87bb413e79)\u2014finally\nputting money into their women\u2019s sides, building up domestic leagues and\nnational teams at once, in another four years, the U.S. is going to have an\neven harder fight to stay on top.\n\nThis year\u2019s tournament proves that even modest investments from a country\u2019s\nsoccer federation can build formidable opponents. Look to the most difficult\nteams the USWNT faced ahead of the final:\n[France](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-fra-henriques-\nintervi/france-ready-to-complete-womens-game-development-idUKKCN1R31BP) and\n[England](https://www.apnews.com/f5142002cee94f92828a0586ed9264d3),\nfederations without long histories of success that have both recently grown\ntheir women\u2019s domestic leagues by leaps and bounds. Europe as a whole showed\nup strongly in this tournament: Other than the U.S., every single team in the\nquarterfinal round was European. According [to\nUEFA](https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=2616073.html), Europe\u2019s\ngoverning body of soccer, national associations invested \u20ac123 million in their\nwomen\u2019s divisions this year, and the number of active professional women\nplayers on the continent was up 50 percent since 2017. By contrast, Concacaf,\nthe soccer governing body that covers North and Central America and the\nCaribbean, including the U.S. Soccer Federation, unveiled its [first-ever\nwomen\u2019s development strategy](https://www.concacaf.com/en/article/concacaf-\nannounces-strategic-plan-to-develop-women-s-football) just this year, citing\nno specific investment figures.\n\nToday\u2019s close match against the otherwise undefeated Netherlands, the reigning\nEuropean champion, is proof of this truth in women\u2019s soccer: Invest in it and\nthe trophies will come. Just a decade ago, the best women soccer players in\nthe Netherlands [didn\u2019t even have teams to play\non](https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-usa-netherlands-world-cup-\nfinal-20190704-story.html). There was no professional league in the country\nfor women until 2007 and even in the youth system, many stars were left to\nplay on boys\u2019 teams. Until the 1970s women were banned from playing soccer by\nthe Dutch federation (England and Brazil had similar laws in place for years).\nBut since the Netherlands was forced by UEFA to field and pay a women\u2019s team,\nthe program has flourished.\n\nUnlike the United States, countries that have well-established men\u2019s soccer\nleagues have a head start in terms of building dominating women\u2019s national\nteams. The Dutch, for instance, are known for their [intensive development\nprograms](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Soccer-t.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=C751A42D5076E33CF437FC26F7D863A5&gwt=pay)\nfor male youth players, and their men\u2019s team has always punched above the\nweight of a relatively small nation. Countries like theirs\u2014with world-class\ntraining facilities, wide networks of coaches, and deep-rooted player-\ndevelopment programs\u2014are able to plug into the resources that have already\nbeen established on the men\u2019s side. Even with just a fraction of the\ninvestment, the Netherlands has launched its women\u2019s team from nonexistence to\nalmost World Cup champions in little more than a decade.\n\nEngland, too, has made great strides capitalizing on its strong men\u2019s system\nrecently. Two years ago, while reporting a story about American women players\nwho had signed contracts with English Women\u2019s Super League teams (the women\u2019s\ncounterpart of England\u2019s Premier League), I saw firsthand what a difference it\nmade for women to take part in the topflight Premier League system. I went to\nChelsea\u2019s training grounds to watch a women\u2019s practice: The facilities for the\nwomen weren\u2019t exactly the same as those of the storied men\u2019s team, of course.\nThey existed in a smallish building on the back corner of the acres and acres\nof perfectly groomed soccer pitches\u2014but the women were still part of the club.\nThey practiced on those same fields, had access to the same trainers and team\ndoctors. Their coaching staff was on the Chelsea payroll.\n\nThe Lionesses\u2019 powerful showing in the past two Women\u2019s World Cups (fourth\nplace in 2019 and third place in 2018) shows that the investment from those\nclubs, from sponsors (the Women\u2019s Super League just signed a [three-year\nsponsorship deal with Barclays](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47605807)),\nand from their national federation is paying off. Of course, most national\nteams in Europe, too, still struggle with pay inequality, and none are\ninvesting equally in their women\u2019s and men\u2019s sides. But some of these nations\nthat already have internationally competitive men\u2019s systems will soon have a\nleg up on the U.S. if this momentum continues.\n\nSome [1 billion people tuned in to](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/women-\ns-soccer-enters-new-era-huge-world-cup-audiences-n1025566) the Women\u2019s World\nCup this year. That\u2019s roughly one in every eight people on the planet. If this\ntournament has proved anything, it\u2019s that women\u2019s soccer is not a sideshow and\nhas vast moneymaking potential. Those federations, those leagues, those\nnations that are making the effort are already seeing the payoff: successful,\nprofitable teams. In France, Olympique Lyonnais has won six of the past nine\nChampions League Finals, and brought more than [19,000 spectators per\nmatch](https://www.ol.fr/en/contents/articles/2019/06/03/groupama-stadium-\nsets-attendance-records-2018-2019) to each home game last season. In the U.S.,\nthe Portland Thorns, of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, regularly play in\nfront of a packed stadium, simply because the product is good, and because the\nteam is [marketed right alongside](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland-\nthorns/2018/03/portland_thorns_owner_merritt_1.html) its Major League Soccer\ncounterpart, the Portland Timbers. Women\u2019s soccer is proving over and over\nthat if you make the investment in the facilities, in the team, in the\nmarketing, and in the television rights, people will watch and the product\nwill improve.\n\nFIFA allocated just $30 million in prize money for the teams competing in the\nWomen\u2019s World Cup, as compared with $440 million for those that will play in\nthe [next Men\u2019s World Cup](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-worldcup-\nusa-nld/rapinoe-slams-fifa-over-schedule-prize-money-idUSKCN1U10E1). (The\nwomen\u2019s championship team will receive $4 million this year, while the 2022\nmen\u2019s championship team is set to receive $38 million).* The organization has\nallowed women\u2019s international tournaments to be [played on\nturf](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/womens-world-cup-will-be-played-\non-lush-green-artificial-\nturf/2015/06/05/a786a0ac-0b8d-11e5-951e-8e15090d64ae_story.html?utm_term=.ee38a4e9f3b3),\nand it even decided to play the men\u2019s Gold Cup tournament on [the same day as\nthe Women\u2019s World Cup](https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/world-cup/news/megan-\nrapinoe-says-fifas-error-of-world-cup-gold-cup-finals-on-same-day-is-terrible-\nscheduling-for-everyone/). But it can no longer ignore the profit potential of\nwomen\u2019s soccer, as it has for decades, or suggest women can\u2019t compete, aren\u2019t\nworth watching, or aren\u2019t worth paying.

Masrani became the CEO of The Toronto-Dominion Bank\n([TSE:TD](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/banks/tsx-td/toronto-dominion-bank-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=Intro_ticker&blueprint=815944))\nin 2014. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in\ncomparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. After that, we will\nconsider the growth in the business. And finally we will reflect on how common\nstockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of\nperformance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay\nlevels.\n\n[ Check out our latest analysis for Toronto-Dominion Bank\n](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/banks/tsx-td/toronto-dominion-bank-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=CTA_ticker&blueprint=815944)\n\n### How Does Bharat Masrani's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized\nCompanies?\n\nOur data indicates that The Toronto-Dominion Bank is worth CA$137b, and total\nannual CEO compensation is CA$15m. (This figure is for the year to October\n2018). While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting\nthe salary is lower, valued at CA$1.3m. We took a group of companies with\nmarket capitalizations over CA$11b, and calculated the median CEO total\ncompensation to be CA$9.0m. Once you start looking at very large companies,\nyou need to take a broader range, because there simply aren't that many of\nthem.\n\nThus we can conclude that Bharat Masrani receives more in total compensation\nthan the median of a group of large companies in the same market as The\nToronto-Dominion Bank. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the pay is too\nhigh. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into\nthe underlying business performance.\n\nYou can see, below, how CEO compensation at Toronto-Dominion Bank has changed\nover time.\n\n[![TSX:TD CEO Compensation, September 16th\n2019](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![TSX:TD CEO Compensation,\nSeptember 16th\n2019](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zWd1__tehA6TgfIg9w7lUw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/bd4af484c857a3727bcbc2b63a29a67d)TSX:TD\nCEO Compensation, September 16th\n2019More](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/banks/tsx-td/toronto-dominion-bank-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=Infographic&amp;blueprint=815944#ceo_salary)\n\n### Is The Toronto-Dominion Bank Growing?\n\nOn average over the last three years, The Toronto-Dominion Bank has grown\nearnings per share (EPS) by 11% each year (using a line of best fit). Its\nrevenue is up 6.6% over last year.\n\nThis shows that the company has improved itself over the last few years. Good\nnews for shareholders. It's also good to see modest revenue growth, suggesting\nthe underlying business is healthy. It could be important to check [this free\nvisual depiction of **what analysts expect** for the\nfuture](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/banks/tsx-td/toronto-dominion-bank-\nshares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=815944#future).\n\n### Has The Toronto-Dominion Bank Been A Good Investment?\n\nMost shareholders would probably be pleased with The Toronto-Dominion Bank for\nproviding a total return of 47% over three years. As a result, some may\nbelieve the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar\nsize.\n\n### In Summary...\n\nWe compared the total CEO remuneration paid by The Toronto-Dominion Bank, and\ncompared it to remuneration at a group of other large companies. We found that\nit pays well over the median amount paid in the benchmark group.\n\nHowever we must not forget that the EPS growth has been very strong over three\nyears. In addition, shareholders have done well over the same time period. So,\nconsidering this good performance, the CEO compensation may be quite\nappropriate.

This summer showed us that would be a\nfool's errand.\n\nNot only is it impossible to know _what_ will happen in the trade market, but\nyou also can't know _when_ things will happen.\n\nSure, there are some clues within the regular season. Dec. 15 is when players\nwho signed free-agent deals this summer can be dealt. Feb. 6 is the deadline.\n\nBut even though there's a buffer between now and both of those dates, you can\nbe sure teams around the league are already doing their due diligence.\n\nEven good teams lay out contingencies upon contingencies. You need to be\nprepared for anything. Some whiteboards may be home to shorter lists than\nothers, but everyone should have some targets, even if they don't end up\npursuing them.\n\nWith that in mind, you'll find below one player who each squad _should_ be\ntargeting.\n\n# The Andre Iguodala Teams\n\n1 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nThe most intriguing name in the trade market might be [Andre\nIguodala](http://bleacherreport.com/andre-iguodala). While there was some\nspeculation about a buyout when the Memphis Grizzlies acquired him in July,\nthey've since angled toward getting some compensation for the 2015 Finals MVP.\n\nAs [Sean Deveney](https://heavy.com/sports/2019/11/andre-iguodala-grizzlies-\nlakers-clippers-nuggets-mavericks/) wrote for Heavy.com:\n\n _\"Memphis plans to wait on a buyout with Iguodala until February's trade\ndeadline. The Grizzlies are still holding out hope that a trade can be worked\nout and have been holding firm on their asking price of a first-round pick. If\nnot, Iguodala will be cut loose from Memphis and free to sign with whomever he\nchooses\u2014around the league, that's expected to be the Lakers.\"_\n\nWhich teams should be exploring the possibility of intercepting Iguodala\nbefore he winds up with the Lakers?\n\n**Dallas Mavericks**\n\nAs of Monday, Dallas' Luka Doncic was fourth in the NBA in\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-\nratings/)'s offensive RAPTOR plus/minus, trailing only [James\nHarden](http://bleacherreport.com/james-harden), LeBron James and [Damian\nLillard](http://bleacherreport.com/damian-lillard).\n\nHe's a one-man offense, but he could use a versatile defender to cover him on\nthe other end. Delon Wright may be that, but the two have spent less time\ntogether than some expected coming into the season.\n\nIguodala can handle a variety of assignments on defense, and he can do some\nfacilitating on the other end. You don't want to take the ball out of Doncic's\nhands more than you need to, but mixing in more catch-and-shoot opportunities\nmight help his already strong efficiency.\n\n**Denver Nuggets**\n\nTime heals all wounds. While the circumstances surrounding Iguodala's 2013\ndeparture from the Nuggets weren't pretty, bringing him back makes sense now.\n\n[Marc Stein](https://static.nytimes.com/email-\ncontent/MSB_14965.html?campaign_id=48&instance_id=10722&segment_id=14965&user_id=a919c0b03478fa168d822f73570320cc\u00aei_id=84522216)\nof the _New York Times_ reported this summer that Denver would have interest\nif Iggy was bought out. It might need to get more aggressive to prevent him\nfrom going to L.A. post-buyout.\n\nThe Nuggets have plenty of wings, but Malik Beasley and Will Barton are a\nlittle small to play the 3. Jerami Grant, Michael Porter Jr. and Juancho\nHernangomez should all be 4s. Iguodala is a more experienced and savvier\ndefender than any of those five. And his basketball IQ would almost certainly\nfit in Denver's cut-heavy offense alongside Nikola Jokic.\n\n**Houston Rockets**\n\nHouston has had plenty of success over the years with a simple formula that\nreads something like this: \"James Harden plus plenty of grit equals wins.\"\n\nIguodala would fit seamlessly into that formula.\n\n**Los Angeles Clippers**\n\nThe Lakers aren't the only L.A. team that should be after Iggy. The Clippers\nalready have plenty of perimeter defense with Kawhi Leonard, [Paul\nGeorge](http://bleacherreport.com/paul-george) and Patrick Beverley. Add\nIguodala to lineups with those three, and the Clips become a full-blown\nnightmare on that end.\n\n**Los Angeles Lakers**\n\nAs Deveney noted, the Lakers might be the leader in the clubhouse for the\nbuyout scenario. But if L.A. thinks another team may swoop in and get him via\ntrade, it may think about such a move itself.\n\nThe problem is that the Lakers roster pretty much takes them out of the trade\nmarket, regardless of the target. There aren't many deals (maybe none) that\nare good for salary-matching purposes. Plus, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, JaVale\nMcGee and Rajon Rondo all have to consent to be traded.\n\n**Utah Jazz**\n\nSwitchability on defense and playmaking ability on the other are valued in\nUtah's system. Iguodala could beef up an already versatile wing corps that\nincludes Joe Ingles and Royce O'Neale.\n\n# Atlanta Hawks: Andre Drummond\n\n2 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nKent Smith/Getty Images\n\nTeams around the league should be keeping an eye on the Detroit Pistons, who\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/)\ncurrently forecasts to finish well shy of a playoff spot.\n\nIf things continue to go poorly in the Motor City, a [fire\nsale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5hgjlOeA24) might be in order.\n\nThe two biggest targets would be Andre Drummond and [Blake\nGriffin](http://bleacherreport.com/blake-griffin). With contention nowhere in\nsight, do the Pistons really want to be on the hook for Drummond's next big\ncontract?\n\nThe center has a player option worth $28.8 million for next season, but with a\ndearth of top-tier free agents on the market this summer, he's likely to turn\nthat down.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks could justify re-signing Drummond to a monster deal (after\ntrading for him, of course).\n\nTrae Young looks like the game's next great point guard. While he already has\na good pick-and-roll partner in John Collins, Atlanta looks committed to\nkeeping him at the 4.\n\nDrummond would be a monumental upgrade over Alex Len at the 5. And his\nefficiency could get a huge boost playing alongside Young. He's never had a\npoint guard with Young's vision and passing ability.\n\nLogistically, Atlanta has one of the best trade chips in the market in\nChandler Parsons' expiring contract. That and one intriguing young player like\nDe'Andre Hunter would satisfy league trade rules.\n\n# Boston Celtics: Dewayne Dedmon\n\n3 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nDespite the summer departure of [Kyrie\nIrving](http://bleacherreport.com/kyrie-irving), the Boston Celtics are\ncruising. Basketball-wise, Kemba Walker has been able to approximate\neverything Irving did. Chemistry-wise, Kemba is an upgrade.\n\nThe [bigger loss](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2844566-boston-celtics-\nwill-miss-al-horford-way-more-than-kyrie-irving) was always going to be [Al\nHorford](http://bleacherreport.com/al-horford).\n\nWhile Robert Williams, Enes Kanter and Daniel Theis all have their various\nstrengths, that seems like the most obvious spot to upgrade.\n\nWould the San Antonio Spurs want to avoid Jakob Poeltl's restricted free\nagency? Are the Sacramento Kings already experiencing buyer's remorse with\nDewayne Dedmon (and ready to move Marvin Bagley to the 5)? Do the Philadelphia\n76ers have enough center minutes from Joel Embiid and Horford to be willing to\nmove Kyle O'Quinn?\n\nThe problem with any of those targets is Boston's lack of comparable trade\nassets. If the Celtics aren't willing to get aggressive and offer Jaylen Brown\nor Gordon Hayward, it may be tough to find a deal.\n\nPerhaps if the Kings continue to underperform expectations, Dedmon could be\nhad for something built around Kanter (on a shorter and cheaper contract),\nRomeo Langford (a 2019 first-rounder) and one other piece for filler.\n\nDedmon can protect the rim while still being able to space the floor beyond\nthe three-point line on the other end. That'd give the likes of Walker, Brown,\nHayward and Jayson Tatum more room to operate inside.\n\n# Brooklyn Nets: Alec Burks\n\n4 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nHannah Foslien/Getty Images\n\nAdd D'Angelo Russell to the growing list of Golden State Warriors scorers who\nare out with injuries.\n\nOn Saturday, ESPN's [Adrian\nWojnarowski](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1195786519220498433) reported\nthat Russell \"will be re-evaluated with a sprained right thumb in two weeks.\"\n\nLet the Alec Burks showcase begin.\n\nAs of Monday, Burks is averaging 13.5 points and shooting 36.8 percent from\nthree, and he's about to get even more opportunities.\n\n\"Burks could become expendable,\" [Anthony\nSlater](https://theathletic.com/1357533/2019/11/07/five-observations-jordan-\npooles-slump-alec-burks-market-value-and-the-warriors-loss-in-houston/) wrote\nfor The Athletic after the wing dropped 28 in an early November performance.\n\"He's eligible to be traded in mid-December, and if he can repeat even a\nfraction of Wednesday's performance with regularity, Burks could become an\nattractive February deadline target for a playoff team in need of some bench\npunch.\"\n\nThe Nets are exactly that kind of squad, only they're more of a playoff\nhopeful than an actual playoff team right now.\n\nBrooklyn could use more scoring from the wing, especially with Caris LeVert\nset to miss several weeks after undergoing thumb surgery.\n\n# Charlotte Hornets: Bogdan Bogdanovic\n\n5 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nSacramento has already locked up Buddy Hield to a hefty long-term extension.\nAll signs indicate that'll happen with De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley III as\nwell. That may make Bogdan Bogdanovic the odd man out.\n\n\"That's not something they're looking at too seriously now as far as anyone\ncan tell,\" a general manager told\n[Deveney](https://heavy.com/sports/2019/10/bogdan-bogdanovi-nba-trade-rumor-\nsacramento-kings/). \"They're probably going to have to, but that's not\nsomething to rush into. There would be a good market for Bogdanovic if they\nfigure they can't go far right now, but [the Kings] are still looking at how\nto make all of this work this season.\"\n\nIf it doesn't work\u2014certainly possible in the ever-competitive West\u2014Sacramento\nmay have to get serious in looking for some value for Bogdanovic.\n\nThe Hornets have gotten off to a better-than-expected start, and if they stay\nnear the playoff hunt, they may make a push to get in.\n\nSweetening Nicolas Batum's bad salary with a first-round pick in exchange for\nBogdanovic and Trevor Ariza works under the cap rules.\n\nGetting a first for Bogey would be a win for the Kings, even if Batum ties up\na big chunk of the books next season. He'd be gone by the time any Fox or\nBagley extension would kick in.\n\nFor the Hornets, adding another playmaker alongside Terry Rozier and Devonte'\nGraham would make them even less predictable. And Bogdanovic is in the same\nage range as Rozier and Cody Zeller.\n\n# Chicago Bulls: Malik Beasley\n\n6 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nMatthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nWith Tomas Satoransky, Zach LaVine, Otto Porter Jr. and Lauri Markkanen all on\nthe roster, it was reasonable to expect decent three-point shooting from the\n2019-20 Chicago Bulls.\n\nBut a month into the season, Chicago ranks in the bottom third of the league\nin both three-point percentage and [effective field-goal\npercentage](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html#misc_stats::17).\n\nA good stretch from a few of the aforementioned shooters could send the Bulls\nflying up those charts, but outsourcing the problem might be in order.\n\nDenver has a glut of wings and may not be able to pay Malik Beasley, who's\nover 40 percent from three both this season and last year, as he enters\nrestricted free agency this summer.\n\nHaving Beasley space the floor for second units that currently include non-\nshooter Kris Dunn could go a long way toward remedying this issue.\n\n# Cleveland Cavaliers: Juancho Hernangomez\n\n7 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nGarrett Ellwood/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking of Nuggets who Denver might not want to pay this summer, Juancho\nHernangomez is an intriguing stretch 4 who hasn't been able to find a\nconsistent role on one of the deepest teams in the league.\n\nIn Cleveland, he'd have more opportunities to show what he can do, especially\nif the Cavs ever go full rebuild and trade Kevin Love.\n\nIn lineups with Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Cedi Osman, Hernangomez\ncould serve as a pressure release outside the three-point line.\n\nOver the course of his career, [56.5](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/players/h/hernaju01.html#shooting::none) percent of his attempts\nhave been threes. And his career 36.9 three-point percentage is above average.\n\nForcing bigger defenders to cover Hernangomez outside would create additional\ndriving lanes for Sexton and Garland and could lead to less crowding on\nrebounds for Larry Nance Jr.\n\n# Detroit Pistons: Kyle Lowry\n\n8 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nMorry Gash/Associated Press\n\nThis only makes sense if a couple of other (possibly unlikely) things are\ntrue.\n\nFirst, the Pistons would have to view themselves as buyers rather than steer\ninto a teardown. And second, the Raptors would have to essentially do the\nopposite.\n\nThe Athletic's [John\nHollinger](https://theathletic.com/1335157/2019/10/30/hollinger-all-the-\noptions-on-the-table-for-the-raptors-who-could-rebuild-reload-or-stay-the-\ncourse-this-season/) explained the logic behind a potential Kyle Lowry trade\nback in October:\n\n _\"Toronto's extension with Lowry only makes him more alluring in the eyes of\ncontenders \u2013 instead of a rental, he's around for 18 more months. One needn't\nbrainstorm a list of contenders who might covet Lowry's craftiness, toughness\nand shooting in today's guard-dominated, smallball era \u2014 the answer is, 'All\nof them.' Such a move also offers a clean shift to the future in the\nbackcourt, as the Raptors could comfortably re-sign [Fred VanVleet] as their\nnew long-term starter at the point.\"_\n\nThat logic may be less stable a few weeks later. The Raptors are winning games\nwith Lowry, [Serge Ibaka](http://bleacherreport.com/serge-ibaka) and OG\nAnunoby all out with injuries. It looks like a fully healthy Raptors squad\ncould make it all the way back to the Finals out of an Eastern Conference that\nis tough to pin down.\n\nIf things start to look shaky in Toronto, or it becomes more clear that\nVanVleet is ready to be the long-term solution at the 1, moving Lowry might\nmake some sense.\n\nHe's exactly the kind of player who could salvage Detroit's season. He\ncommands far more attention outside than Reggie Jackson or Derrick Rose. He's\na more consistent defender as well.\n\nThe Blake Griffin-Andre Drummond pairing was always going to be a wonky fit,\nbut a five-time All-Star who can shoot and has championship pedigree could go\na long way toward ironing things out.\n\n# Golden State Warriors: Juancho Hernangomez\n\n9 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nGarrett Ellwood/Getty Images\n\nGolden State is another squad that could use Hernangomez's outside stroke.\nThis season could serve as something of an extended audition for him.\n\nEven before [Stephen Curry](http://bleacherreport.com/stephen-curry) went\ndown, it was abundantly clear the Warriors didn't have enough talent after\ntheir stars. Taking shots at young players who couldn't fit in at their first\nstops is a good way to go.\n\nIf the Warriors were to acquire Hernangomez and have him shoot pretty well in\nthis tank-worthy season, they could re-sign him and improve depth before\n2020-21.\n\nIf he looks as out of place as some of the other Santa Cruz Warriors, it's\neasy to let him walk in free agency.\n\nThis season is the time for the Warriors to look into chances like this.\n\n# Indiana Pacers: Danilo Gallinari\n\n10 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nRon Hoskins/Getty Images\n\nYou can't fault the Pacers for trying out the jumbo frontcourt of Domantas\nSabonis and Myles Turner. However, while it may deserve a little more time for\nevaluation, Indiana has been significantly better with Sabonis at the 5\nalongside a smaller 4.\n\nThe Pacers are\n[minus-0.4](https://stats.nba.com/impact/advanced/#!?LineupIDs=1627734&VsLineupIDs=1626167&TeamID=1610612754&VsTeamID=1610612754)\npoints per 100 possessions with both bigs on the floor. They're plus-8.0 when\nSabonis plays without Turner.\n\nSurrounding Sabonis with floor spacers and letting him operate from the high\nand low posts will make Indiana tougher to defend. He has great touch out to\n15-20 feet and may have inherited the passing gene from his father, Arvydas.\n\nWhen Sabonis is on the floor without Turner, the big man is averaging\n[4.7](https://stats.nba.com/impact/#!?LineupIDs=1627734&VsLineupIDs=1626167&TeamID=1610612754&VsTeamID=1610612754&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PerMode=Per100Possessions&Season=2019-20)\nassists per 75 possessions.\n\nGetting him a lights-out shooter at the 4 would allow him to use that passing\nability to greater advantage.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder looked poised to be this season's primary seller in\nthe trade market. They're already loaded with assets from the Paul George and\n[Russell Westbrook](http://bleacherreport.com/russell-westbrook) deals. The\nremaining veterans could fetch a few more.\n\nMuch of the talk has revolved around [Chris\nPaul](http://bleacherreport.com/chris-paul), but Danilo Gallinari is likely\nmore desirable for most teams, given his age and manageable contract.\n\nFrontcourt minutes with Gallo and Sabonis would be a nightmare for opposing\ndefenses.\n\n# Memphis Grizzlies: Dante Exum\n\n11 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nAlex Goodlett/Getty Images\n\nIf the Jazz were to get into the Iguodala market, as suggested above, moving\nDante Exum would be almost inevitable. For one thing, he's the most obvious\nsalary-matching piece on Utah's roster. He also makes plenty of sense for the\nrebuilding Grizzlies.\n\nThe team seems to have long-term solutions at the 1 (Ja Morant), 4 (Brandon\nClarke) and 5 (Jaren Jackson Jr.). Dillon Brooks has shot the ball well this\nseason and may fit well with those three, but Memphis still needs more wings\nwho fit its timeline.\n\nGiven Morant's slight frame, playing him alongside Exum would make sense for a\nvariety of reasons. Over the course of his injury-plagued career, Exum has\nmanaged to prove one thing: He can ably defend anywhere from the 1 to the 3.\nThe Grizzlies could throw him at the opposition's point guard, thus saving\nMorant for the other end of the floor.\n\nOffensively, Exum has yet to show consistent NBA range, but he's still just 24\nyears old and has a killer first step. If he has the chance to attack\ncloseouts after Morant gets the defense out of sorts, he could be an effective\nsecondary playmaker.\n\n# Miami Heat: Chris Paul\n\n12 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nZach Beeker/Getty Images\n\nThe notion that Chris Paul could join the Miami Heat has lost some steam since\nhe was first acquired by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nCP3's contract and age always made potential deals difficult, but now, Miami\nis performing at what some might consider a better-than-expected level.\n\nWhy shake things up when you're on track for home-court advantage in the first\nround of the playoffs?\n\nWith only one star in Jimmy Butler, Miami would still likely be an underdog in\na playoff series against the Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks or Boston\nCeltics. The Toronto Raptors might even be favored over the Heat.\n\nPaul would up the level of raw talent, and the Heat have the kind of contracts\nnecessary to make a deal.\n\n\"The Thunder would love to trade Chris Paul before the trade deadline so they\ncan hoard even more young talent and draft picks,\" _USA Today_ 's [Mark\nMedina](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dp7yaz/hi_reddit_were_jeff_zillgitt_and_mark_medina_the/f5taj0f/)\nwrote in a Reddit Q&A.; \"Other teams are reluctant to acquire Paul given his\nage, injury history and contract, so that might not happen.\"\n\nIf it becomes clear that getting picks isn't possible for OKC, it may turn its\nsights on simply getting out from under the remainder of CP3's contract. James\nJohnson and Goran Dragic are enough to satisfy the league's salary-matching\nrules. Perhaps a second-round pick or KZ Okpala might make this more\nintriguing for the Thunder.\n\nEither way, such a deal would save OKC a boatload of money and open up\nsignificant flexibility over the coming years.\n\n# Milwaukee Bucks: Jae Crowder\n\n13 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nJoe Murphy/Getty Images\n\nIguodala isn't the only veteran defender Memphis can offer the rest of the\nleague. Jae Crowder was a key component in Utah's dominant defense over the\ntwo seasons prior to this one, and he's on one of the most trade-friendly\ncontracts in the NBA.\n\nCrowder is making just $7.8 million this season. And over the course of his\nrun with the Jazz, he proved capable of guarding any position but the 5.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks have some intriguing young(ish) wings in Donte DiVincenzo\nand Pat Connaughton. Kyle Korver and Wesley Matthews are closing in on the end\nof their careers, but both can still hit catch-and-shoot threes. None of those\nfour are the kind of rugged, switchy defender Crowder is.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is one of the game's best defenders, so hiding him on\ndefense isn't necessary. But it would be nice to have that luxury for\nstretches. Against teams with elite 3/4s like LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard,\nCrowder could take the punishment on the defensive end, allowing Giannis to\npreserve some energy for offense.\n\nOn the other end, Crowder's 33.9 career three-point percentage leaves\nsomething to be desired, but he has a [positive](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/players/c/crowdja01.html#advanced::none) _offensive_ box\nplus/minus in part because of his willingness to take those threes. That\npercentage may be below average, but it's still high enough to force opposing\n4s to pay attention on the perimeter. That creates more space inside the lane.\n\n# Minnesota Timberwolves: D'Angelo Russell\n\n14 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nNoah Graham/Getty Images\n\nCircumstances have changed in the months since D'Angelo Russell chose the\nGolden State Warriors over the Minnesota Timberwolves, such that a trade might\nbe even less likely now.\n\nEven before Stephen Curry got hurt, it was clear the Warriors were nearly\ndevoid of young talent beyond Russell. So why would they unload the one\npotential rising star they have?\n\n\"The Warriors can be earnest when they say they acquired Russell because they\nsaw him as a long-term fit,\" ESPN's [Brian\nWindhorst](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28006386/why-golden-state-\nwarriors-dismal-present-lead-bright-future) wrote. \"But they can equally be\nhonest when they say their short-term game plan has been altered, and it could\nultimately lead them to exploring the trade market for Russell once he becomes\neligible to be moved on Dec. 15.\"\n\nIf Golden State could turn Russell into future picks _and_ players who can\nhelp now, it might have to consider it.\n\nThe \"Robert Covington, Jeff Teague and picks for D-Lo\" framework still makes\nsome sense. That would leave the Warriors with a potential starting five of\nCurry, Klay Thompson, Covington, Draymond Green and Kevon Looney for next\nseason. Fully healthy, that's a contender that could recapture much of the\ndefensive identity that launched that dynasty.\n\nFor Minnesota, adding Russell to a lineup that already has a ton of\npossessions used up by Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins might be\nprecarious, but it would also raise the team's ceiling.\n\nRussell is eight years younger than Teague, but he has a feel for the pick-\nand-roll that belies his age. Defending actions involving him and Towns would\nbe nearly impossible. And with their prowess from the outside, slashing lanes\nshould be even more open than they are now for Wiggins.\n\n# New Orleans Pelicans: Malik Beasley\n\n15 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nLizzy Barrett/Getty Images\n\nWith Zion Williamson out, the New Orleans Pelicans haven't lived up to some of\nthe preseason prognostications. But there have still been plenty of good\nsigns.\n\nBrandon Ingram looks like a bona fide No. 1 scorer. He should be even harder\nto defend when Williamson is back. Health is an issue for Lonzo Ball too, but\nhe's shown the all-around game that made him so intriguing as a rookie when\nhe's on the floor.\n\nOne thing the roster may be missing is a deadeye shooter in the same age range\nas the three mentioned above. Ingram has been that so far this season, but his\ncareer percentage suggests a regression _may_ be coming.\n\nMalik Beasley could be that fit at the 2. He's a career 38.9 percent shooter\nfrom three, and he's 13 years younger than JJ Redick, who currently occupies\nthat role.\n\nAnd it's not as if the high-flying Pelicans need this, but Beasley is a\n[highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58PLxin68aY) finisher around the\nrim too.\n\n# New York Knicks: Bogdan Bogdanovic\n\n16 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\n\"Among teams expected to be interested are the Knicks, who are seeking to\nleverage their short-term deals and cap space to add talent, having missed out\non players in free agency,\" [Deveney](https://heavy.com/sports/2019/10/bogdan-\nbogdanovi-nba-trade-rumor-sacramento-kings/) wrote of the possibility that\nSacramento moves Bogdanovic. \"The Knicks have all their first-round picks\navailable to trade and have Dallas' picks in 2021 and 2023.\"\n\nWould New York really want to use a draft pick to go after Bogdanovic? After\nall, he's already 27 years old and on the verge of a potentially big payday\nthis summer.\n\nBut having Bogdanovic alongside RJ Barrett and Kevin Knox would give the\nKnicks an intriguing, positionless combination of players from 1 to 3.\n\nBogdanovic and Barrett can both engineer possessions as primary ball-handlers.\nAll three have shown an ability to hit outside shots. With a frontcourt that\nincludes paint-dwellers like Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson, that kind of\nbackcourt versatility would be huge.\n\n# Oklahoma City Thunder: Anfernee Simons\n\n17 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nCameron Browne/Getty Images\n\nDespite the recent acquisition of Carmelo Anthony, the Portland Trail Blazers\ncould really use Danilo Gallinari. And they may have one of the more\nfascinating young players to offer up for him.\n\nAfter barely seeing the floor as a rookie, Anfernee Simons has been one of the\nbright spots in a generally disappointing Blazers campaign.\n\nIn just 21.2 minutes per game, Simons is averaging double-digit points and\nshooting 37.3 percent from three off Portland's bench. Still, he doesn't do as\nmuch for the Blazers' short-term prospects as Gallinari would.\n\nThat might make Portland think about moving him.\n\nIn combination with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, OKC would have one of the game's\nmost enticing young backcourts. Two combo guards who can do a little bit of\neverything on offense and have the length to work defensively is a switch-\nheavy scheme.\n\n# Orlando Magic: DeMar DeRozan\n\n18 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nHarry Aaron/Getty Images\n\nFor the [10th](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/players/d/derozde01.html#pbp::none) time in 11 NBA seasons,\nDeMar DeRozan's team has a better plus-minus per 100 possessions when he is\n_out_ of the game.\n\nAnd [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-\npredictions/)'s playoff predictions now have the San Antonio Spurs at less\nthan a 1 percent chance to make the postseason. Only the Knicks have as bad a\nshot.\n\nIt's time to move on from DeRozan.\n\n\"The Spurs could always deal him sooner rather than let him walk for nothing,\"\nThe Ringer's [Kevin\nO'Connor](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/11/13/20962320/san-antonio-spurs-\ndemar-derozan-popovich-trade-style) wrote of San Antonio's dilemma and\nDeRozan's pending decision on his player option. \"Multiple league sources say\nthe Magic are scouring the trade market for scoring help and have already\nexpressed interest in trading for DeRozan.\"\n\nAgain, DeRozan has struggled to positively impact his teams over the years,\nbut he might make some sense within the current construct of the Magic.\n\nOrlando is\n[27th](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&dir=-1) in the\nleague in points per 100 possessions. And their leading scorer, Nikola\nVucevic, is at just 18.2 points per game.\n\nPlugging a volume scorer into a defense-heavy lineup that includes Aaron\nGordon, Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz could help both sides.\n\nDeRozan would command some attention and open things up for the Magic players,\nwho in turn can cover for the significant deficiencies the shooting guard has\non defense.\n\n# Philadelphia 76ers: Doug McDermott\n\n19 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Hoops Stats, the Philadelphia 76ers are\n[25th](http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/teamstats/20/7/pts/1-1)\nin bench points per game and 15th in bench threes per game.\n\nAnd with a starting five that's shooting 31.1 percent from deep, they need all\nthe shooting they can get from the reserves.\n\nRight now, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott are doing a decent job of providing\nit, but Philly could use more marksmanship to mix in with the space-deprived\nunits that play heavy minutes.\n\nDoug McDermott is a career 40.5 percent shooter from three, and he may be\nobtainable once Victor Oladipo and Jeremy Lamb are both back to full health\nfor the Pacers.\n\nAnd like DeRozan with the Magic, Philadelphia has more than enough defense to\ncover for McDermott's shortcomings on that end of the floor.\n\n# Phoenix Suns: Tony Snell\n\n20 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nMichael Reaves/Getty Images\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have been one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of\nthe 2019-20 season.\n\nDevin Booker looks like an All-Star. Ricky Rubio has been a stabilizing force\nfor the offense. Kelly Oubre Jr. is living up to his new contract. And Aron\nBaynes continues to fortify his [cult\nhero](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862721-br-nba-digest-luka-doncics-\nmvp-case-is-very-real#slide8) status.\n\nOne potential weakness is at backup point guard. Tyler Johnson and Jevon\nCarter are both below average in [offensive box\nplus/minus](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/teams/PHO/2020.html#advanced::23). Instead of going out and\nacquiring a reserve 1, Phoenix could lean a little harder into positionless\nbasketball.\n\nOubre, Booker, Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson all fit that mold fairly\nwell. Detroit Pistons wing Tony Snell would too. He can defend multiple\npositions and is a career 38.6 percent shooter from deep.\n\nCarving out some minutes on the wing for Snell would be possible if Booker\nspent a chunk of his time as the backup 1. Surrounded by three or four\npositionless shooters, Booker would cause opposing defenses all kinds of\nproblems.\n\nThis season has shown that Booker is at his best when playing alongside a\ncompetent point guard, but having the option to use him at the 1 against\nbackups would be a nice changeup.\n\n# Portland Trail Blazers: Kevin Love\n\n21 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nMitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\n\"When I've talked to executives out there seeing this [the Blazers' high\npayroll],\" ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on _The Jump_ (h/t [SB\nNation](https://www.blazersedge.com/2019/11/6/20952216/windhorst-trail-\nblazers-active-nba-trade-market)), \"they believe that the Blazers are going to\nbe active in the trade market as the season goes on.\"\n\nUnless Carmelo Anthony is miraculously the 2013 version of himself, that\nacquisition shouldn't change the outlook described by Windhorst. The\n[numbers](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862721-br-nba-digest-luka-\ndoncics-mvp-case-is-very-real#slide2) suggest that move might actually make\nPortland worse.\n\nThe Blazers should still be in the market for help, particularly at the 4.\nDanilo Gallinari has already been identified as an option there, but Kevin\nLove is probably the most obvious target.\n\nCleveland.com's [Chris\nFedor](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2019/11/cavaliers-gm-koby-altman-opens-\nup-about-contract-extension-the-plan-and-why-he-has-no-interest-in-trading-\nkevin-love.html) has reported that the Cavaliers are receiving calls on Love,\nbut general manager Koby Altman responded, \"No. Not at all,\" when asked\nwhether the team had any desire to move the five-time All-Star.\n\nThat may just be posturing on Altman's part. Love is in a decidedly different\nphase of his career than most of the rest of the Cavs. And his early-season\nperformance has likely beefed up his trade value.\n\nLove's [3.0](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/players/l/loveke01.html#advanced::none) box plus/minus is the\nhighest he's posted since the [third-place 8.4](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/play-\nindex/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&year_min=2014&year_max=2014&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=mp&c1comp=gt&c1val=1000&order_by=bpm)\nhe posted in 2013-14. He's averaging 18.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 2.9 assists\nand 0.9 steals per game.\n\nThat may be good enough to drag Cleveland to an ahead-of-schedule return to\nthe postseason\n([FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/)\npegs the Cavs' postseason chance at 12 percent). If they stay in the hunt all\nseason, it wouldn't be a surprise if Altman's words proved true.\n\nBut the way Love is playing right now makes him one of the league's biggest\ntrade chips. It's easy to draw the connection to Portland, where Love played\nhis high school basketball and the professional team is in dire need of a 4.\n\nThe problem for the Blazers is that their best asset, Anfernee Simons, plays\nroughly the same position as Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Kevin Porter\nJr. One might argue Simons has as high a ceiling as any of those three,\nthough. And four shots at a game-changing guard is better than three.\n\n# Sacramento Kings: Aaron Gordon\n\n22 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nHarry Aaron/Getty Images\n\nIf the Magic continue to play underwhelming basketball, they may have to think\nabout making some changes. Teams around the league seem clued into that.\n\n\"Multiple teams are monitoring Magic forward Aaron Gordon with interest should\nan opportunity present itself, but the Magic have shown no interest in moving\nhim,\" The Athletic's [Shams\nCharania](https://theathletic.com/1381507/?source=twittered) wrote. \"Orlando\nis 4-7 and working to turn the corner early this season. Gordon signed a four-\nyear, $76 million deal to return to the Magic in 2018.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Kings are one team that should be interested.\n\nThey have what appear to be long-term solutions at the 1 (De'Aaron Fox), 2\n(Buddy Hield) and 5 (Marvin Bagley III). A switchy 4 who can put pressure on\nthe rim would fit well.\n\nPerhaps something built around Bogdan Bogdanovic would intrigue the Magic,\nwho, as previously noted, are in the hunt for some offense.\n\n# San Antonio Spurs: Aaron Gordon\n\n23 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nPhelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are in desperate need of a shake-up.\n\nIf Orlando is really asking about DeMar DeRozan, the Spurs need to take those\ninquiries seriously. The Magic would likely try to keep their top talents out\nof the deal, but if they continue to lose more than they win, desperation of\ntheir own might kick in.\n\nGordon would instantly improve San Antonio's defense, and not having DeRozan\naround would open up opportunities for young guards Dejounte Murray, Derrick\nWhite and Lonnie Walker IV.\n\nAll three probably deserve more minutes: Murray and White because they've been\n[better than](https://www.basketball-\nreference.com/teams/SAS/2020.html#advanced::25) DeRozan, and Walker because\nit's time to show whether he belongs.\n\nThe more obvious upgrade would be having Gordon at the 4 instead of Trey\nLyles. The latter leads San Antonio in rebounding and is having something of a\nbounce-back campaign, but he makes more sense in a reserve role.\n\n# Toronto Raptors: JJ Redick\n\n24 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nJonathan Bachman/Getty Images\n\nJJ Redick's playoff streak is in jeopardy. After making the postseason in each\nof his first 13 NBA seasons, Redick finds himself on the Pelicans, who are\nsitting on a 23 percent chance to get in, per\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/).\n\nLast time he was with a team that was on track to miss the playoffs (the\n2012-13 Magic), he was traded to the eventual eighth-seeded Bucks.\n\nHistory might repeat itself in 2019-20.\n\nIf it becomes clear New Orleans isn't going to qualify, it might look to move\nsome of the veterans on the roster for assets and more prospects to mix in\nwith Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Frank Jackson.\n\nThe Raptors are shooting well in the early part of the season, but midseason\nregressions from Pascal Siakam (35.1 percent, compared to a 31.6 career three-\npoint percentage) and OG Anunoby (52.5 percent, compared to 36.7) wouldn't be\nshocking.\n\nToronto could hedge against that possibility by adding a veteran floor-spacer\nlike Redick. His presence beyond the three-point line would open things up\ninside for Siakam, [Marc Gasol](http://bleacherreport.com/marc-gasol) and\nSerge Ibaka.\n\n# Washington Wizards: Noah Vonleh\n\n25 of 25\n\n![](https://static-\nassets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png)\n\nJim Mone/Associated Press\n\nThe Washington Wizards are in the phase of a rebuild when they should be\ngiving themselves as many chances as possible at each position.\n\nBradley Beal at shooting guard is a sure thing. There may not be another one\non the roster, despite how good Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant have looked.\n\nEven if the 24-year-old Noah Vonleh wouldn't immediately supplant Washington's\ncurrent power forwards or centers in the rotation, he's the kind of talent the\nWizards should be after.\n\nVonleh was the No. 9 pick in 2014, and he's been a journeyman ever since. At\nvarious times in his career, he's shown flashes of rim protection, great\nrebounding and even floor spacing.\n\nMaybe Washington is the place he'd put all three together.\n\n_Unless otherwise noted, all stats are current as of Nov. 18 and courtesy\nof[NBA.com/stats](https://stats.nba.com/) or [Basketball\nReference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)._\n\n  * Facebook Logo\n  * Twitter Logo\n  * Copy Link Icon\n\nBleacher Report Logo\n\n  * [Facebook Logo](https://facebook.com/bleacherreport/)\n  * [Twitter Logo](https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/)\n  * [Instagram Logo](https://instagram.com/bleacherreport/)\n\n  * [About](/pages/about)\n  * [Advertise](/pages/advertise)\n  * [Contact Us](/pages/contact)\n  * [Careers](/pages/careers)\n  * [Community Guidelines](/pages/comguidelines)\n  * [Privacy](/pages/privacy)\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * [Terms Of Use](/pages/terms)\n  * [Tickets](https://www.stubhub.com/?gcid=chAFF-_-geoUS-_-genAllTix-_-dt170312-_-cmpBR_footr-_-partBleacherReport)\n  * AdChoices ![](https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/molecules/footer/adChoices.png)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Bleacher Report, Inc.

According to\ndata from [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/reports/189830/e.aspx), only 19\npercent of Millennials say they receive routine feedback from managers and\nonly 17 percent say the feedback they receive is meaningful. This lack of more\nfrequent feedback could be causing Millennials to feel unfulfilled in their\njobs thereby possibly impacting business success. A study by\n[Clutch](https://clutch.co/hr/resources/engage-millennial-employees-feedback-\nevaluation) revealed, of the Millennials whose managers do provide accurate\nand consistent feedback, 72 percent find their job fulfilling compared to only\n38 percent of those whose managers do not.\n\nAs a busy HR leader, implementing a change of this significance is easier said\nthan done; but an [engaging performance review\nprocess](https://www.paychex.com/articles/human-resources/changing-employee-\nperformance-reviews) is critical to driving [job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/) and employee\nengagement, especially for Millennials and now Gen Z. Here are some key steps\nto making frequent feedback the norm in your organization:\n\n## **Step One: Evaluate Your Current Performance Review Process**\n\nAre employees surprised by what they\u2019re hearing in performance reviews? They\nshouldn\u2019t be. Unclear expectations and unexpected feedback can be a sign that\nmanagers may not have been checking in enough. If there is too much time\nbetween conversations, recency effect can come into play as managers tend to\nreflect exclusively on the good work or mistakes made in just the past few\nweeks. This means that potentially great work gets overlooked and some problem\nareas are never addressed. Every team is different, but often real-time\nfeedback helps employees establish good habits rather than needing to break\nbad ones down the road.\n\nAnother aspect of the performance review process to evaluate closely is how\nemployee progress is measured. Often, when reviews are completed infrequently,\nmanagers can inadvertently judge their direct reports against one another. One\nshining star can make other solid workers seem subpar and one problematic\nemployee can make it easy to ignore the challenges of their colleagues. More\nfrequent feedback can help employees and their managers set timely goals and\nmilestones by which to measure their performance and help avoid this\ncomparison bias.\n\nA challenge many businesses face in reviews is a lack of motivation from both\nmanagers and employees to participate in the process. Ideally, everyone should\nfeel energized by performance reviews and feedback, empowered to make progress\ntoward their individual goals, and contribute to achieving team and company\ngoals. To accomplish this, reviews should center on the development and\ncoaching communications rather than criticism, positioning employees to be\nmore successful and helping them understand why their contribution is\nvaluable.\n\nAlso Read: [What's Better Than Employee Benefits? Employee Career\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/employee-career-development-tips-and-solutions/)\n\n## **Step Two: Communicate the Change to Your Employees**\n\nWhen switching from an annual review process to more frequent feedback, there\nmay be some initial assumptions that the new way will be more time-consuming.\nTherefore, it is important to communicate the benefits and the correct way of\ntransitioning to this method. Ultimately, the goal of frequent, effective\nfeedback is to drive engagement, loyalty, and satisfaction among employees.\nWhen done right, performance reviews are a valuable asset to the organization\nand not just a \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d exercise.\n\nIf your annual performance review process has traditionally been tied to\npromotions and raises, you\u2019ll want to communicate carefully around how this\nshift impacts the timing of pay increases and the benefits of separating the\ntwo. When reviews are connected to salary, feedback often freezes when wages\ndo. Not only do employees not receive raises during this period, but they also\nstop receiving an acknowledgment that their work is valued. As a result,\nengagement may plummet. The elimination of an annual review reduces those\nformal expectations around feedback and creates more open dialogue between\nmanagers and employees.\n\n**Learn More:[Employee Engagement vs. Job Satisfaction: Key Differences and\nMetrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-\nengagement-vs-job-satisfaction-differences/)**\n\n## **Step Three: Implement the Right Tools**\n\nThe tools used to facilitate employee feedback, goal setting, and progress\ntowards those goals should be flexible and based on employee needs. Employees\nmay require a different approach based on level of experience, their role\nwithin the company, and the type of work they do, among other factors.\nHowever, there are several common tools that can help optimize the review\nprocess overall. A learning management system (LMS), for example, can be\ncustomized based on the types of training employees need at the time \u2013 both\nhard skills for their job duties and soft skills such as communication and\nprofessionalism. Through the LMS, employees can take development into their\nown hands and managers can easily track employees\u2019 progress toward training\nmilestones.\n\nTo ensure they\u2019re basing feedback on the most accurate information possible,\nmanagers should keep an activity log. A simple tracker of employee activity\n(including both highs and lows) helps managers deliver quality, timely\nfeedback and content-rich examples that are specific to an employee and their\ngoals and not based on comparisons to colleagues. Additionally, this record\nhelps maintain the proper look-back period when doing quarterly or monthly\nreviews, for example.\n\nWhen making the switch from annual performance reviews to offering more\nfrequent feedback, be sure to emphasize the benefits to the company, managers,\nand employees alike. Remember that any change in process requires time and\ntraining to fully and properly implement. But in the end, employees may be\nmore engaged and satisfied with their job experience and retention and\nproductivity should improve as a result.\n\nAlso Read: [5 Exciting CultureTech Platforms to Help You Establish Company\nCulture](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/5-exciting-culture-\ntech-platforms-to-establish-company-culture/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fbest-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Best+Practices+for+Switching+from+Annual+Performance+Reviews+to+More+Frequent+Feedback\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Best+Practices+for+Switching+from+Annual+Performance+Reviews+to+More+Frequent+Feedback&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fbest-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fbest-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fbest-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Best Practices for Switching from Annual\nPerformance Reviews to More Frequent\nFeedback&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fbest-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?
