This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm.

It\nwas a big deal at the time and helped usher in the shift from print to\ndigital. But LMS have not changed much\u2014they all presume a sequence of\ndisconnected, disciple-based courses for which students receive letter grades\n(often an averaged mess of achievement, efforts, and attendance). It\u2019s a lousy\nway to organize and report on modern learning.\n\nWhy so little progress in two decades? Well-intentioned federal policy passed\nin 2001 reinforced a focus on grade-level proficiency. Higher education\ncontinues to value traditional transcripts, grades and standardized tests.\nBoth factors have locked-in traditional structures and communication vehicles.\n\nOn the edtech front, Google and then Microsoft offered free learning\nplatforms, which resulted in dampened LMS investment. Gradebooks are often\nassociated with student information systems (SIS), which also produce\ncompliance reports for districts and states\u2014making relationships sticky and\ninnovation low.  \n\nWhile there are many reasons for market blockages, the demand for competency\ntracking is exploding. The shift to 1:1 computer access in most schools has\nresulted in a dramatic increase in the amount formative feedback from\nassessments embedded in digital curriculum and available from a variety of\neducational applications. The result is an order of magnitude increase in\nformative feedback in traditional academic competencies. (Combining those can\nbe a challenge, but that\u2019s a different blog on interoperability).\n\nToday In: [Education](https://www.forbes.com/education)\n\n  * [\n\n### Going To School Usually Pays Off, But These Schools Never Do\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2020/04/07/going-to-school-usually-\npays-off-but-these-schools-never-do/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Senators Seek Help For Student Loan Borrowers Left Out Of Coronavirus\nRelief Bill\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesleywhistle/2020/04/07/senators-seek-help-\nfor-student-loan-borrowers-left-out-of-coronavirus-relief/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Finding The Teachable Moments During COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/phyllislockett/2020/04/07/finding-the-\nteachable-moments-during-covid-19/)\n\nThe result of more feedback without systems to capture the data is hand-\nscribbled data walls (like the featured image) and lots of spreadsheets.\n\nBeyond reading, writing, and math, thousands of schools have or are in the\nprocess of adopting a [portrait of a\ngraduate](https://portraitofagraduate.org/ \"https://portraitofagraduate.org/\")\nthat incorporates the aspirations of a community, often including\ncommunication, collaboration, critical thinking, and other workplace success\nskills.

Similarly,\n[KnowledgeWorks\u2019 Foundation of\nReadiness](https://knowledgeworks.org/resources/foundation-readiness/\n\"https://knowledgeworks.org/resources/foundation-readiness/\") puts social and\nemotional learning at the heart of an outcome framework focused on the future\nof work.\n\nGrant-funded school networks often adopt broader measures of success. Four\nyears ago, [XQ Institute](https://xqsuperschool.org/\n\"https://xqsuperschool.org/\") began making grants to innovative high schools\nthat adopted the [XQ Learner Goals](https://xqsuperschool.org/xq-schools/xq-\nlearner-goals \"https://xqsuperschool.org/xq-schools/xq-learner-goals\"), a\ncomposite framework that includes \u201cOriginal Thinkers\u201d and \u201cGenerous\nCollaborators\u201d and adds \u201cLearning for Life.\u201d  \n\nThe [Mastery Transcript Consortium](https://mastery.org/\n\"https://mastery.org/\") is helping more than 300 schools create a high school\ntranscript that reflects the unique skills, strengths, and interests of each\nlearner. This new format will encourage higher education to accept alternative\nformats and will influence high school transformation as well.  \n\nLast week, I visited three innovative schools struggling with competency\ntracking. A Memphis school uses Powerschool to report attendance and grades to\nthe authorizer, but tracks progress on 12 competencies manually. An Oakland\nschool tracks progress on nine cross-cutting competencies by hand. A Kansas\nCity school teaches leadership and design thinking without a great system for\ntracking growth in these foundational skills.\n\n**The Path Forward  **\n\nThe exploding demand for competency tracking deserves better tools than the\nventure-backed edtech market has provided. The path forward is likely to\nrequire funding by impact investors that see the growing demand to support\nemerging solutions.\n\nDesign principles for new systems will include:  \n\n  * **Flexible configuration:** easy to set up school-specific competencies.  \n  * **Planning capabilities:** authoring tools that make it easy to bring competencies into less/unit design.\n  * **Multiple inputs:** flexibility to capture multiple forms of feedback including teacher observations, surveys, and assessments.  \n  * **Combining features:** the potential to give preference to recent feedback and certain sources.\n  * **Evidence components:** including or linking to a portfolio of artifacts.  \n  * **Petition processes:** a way for learners to submit evidence of competencies demonstrated outside of school. \n  * **Asynchronous communication:** support for regular parent and stakeholder feedback (i.e., new report cards) and [extended transcripts](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/helping-grads-tell-their-story-the-case-for-extended-transcripts/ \"https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/helping-grads-tell-their-story-the-case-for-extended-transcripts/\").  \n\nLMS and SIS are foundational to a school\u2019s tech stack, but developers are\nplaying from behind and serving a timid audience when it comes to switching\nenterprise systems. In a recent exchange, a learning platform CEO admitted,\n\u201cWe make platforms for the schools we have.\u201d What he\u2019s missing is that the\ndemand for better tools to track competencies grows every week.\n\nMany teachers have flocked to \u2018free for teacher\u2019 standalone gradebooks, but\nwhen the bell rings students go to the next class and are assessed\ntraditionally with letter grade\u2014and the teacher has to double enter grades\ninto the official system.  \n\nThe fact that tens of thousands of schools continue to manually track student\ngrowth on important competencies via spreadsheets (or hand-scribbled data\nwalls) is crazy.\n\nPromising solutions are most likely to emerge from partnerships between\nnetworks of schools that share thoughtful outcome frameworks and learning\nmodels, scaled providers, and impact investors. It\u2019s time for modern solutions\nfor schools trying to develop the 2030 workforce.  \n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@tvanderark).\n\n[![Tom Vander\nArk](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/400x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-\nimages.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5d261da7142c500008c8c47f%2F960x0.jpg%3FcropX1%3D0%26cropX2%3D399%26cropY1%3D0%26cropY2%3D399)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanderark/\n\"Photo of Tom Vander Ark\")\n\n[Tom Vander Ark](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanderark/)\n\nI am an advocate for better learning for everyone.\n\n As CEO of Getting Smart, I advise schools, districts, networks, foundations\nand learning organizations on the path\n\n\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nI am an advocate for better learning for everyone.\n\n As CEO of Getting Smart, I advise schools, districts, networks, foundations\nand learning organizations on the path forward.

As an organization's most significant\nasset, employees hired must be satisfied, motivated, developed, and retained.\nAn organization\u2019s human resource policies play a very important role in this.\n\nCosmo Films took up HR transformation to create systems and processes which\nproved to be enablers for the company\u2019s journey to becoming an Employer of\nChoice. Some of the processes that we have improved upon in order to define a\nclear focus on capability building, keeping our employees at the core are-\n\n1\\. Performance appraisals\n\n2\\. Recruitment processes\n\n3\\. Compensation and benefits\n\n4\\. Employee engagement\n\n5\\. Employee life cycle\n\n6\\. Rewards & Recognition\n\n7\\. Background checks and verifications\n\n8\\. Automation of HR through implementing SAP\u2019s Success Factor\n\nOne of the major areas that we have worked towards in the past year is\nEmployee Engagement and its 4 pillars through the medium of automated HR. Let\nus discuss them in some detail-\n\n **Employee Engagement**\n\nEmployee Engagement is one of the key focus areas for the company, and we have\ndesigned a very robust and comprehensive engagement model based on the\nfindings of engagement survey of 2017. Engagement is also done by way of\ncapability building, innovative methods of resourcing and culture change. With\nthis systemic and strategic approach, various activities are being carried out\nin the company to boost employee engagement. The engagement model is based on\nfour pillars which are-\n\n **Career Opportunities:-** An employee has clear defined visibility on\nknowledge, skill & attributes required for his position as well as the role\nhe/she would aspire to be in and requisite resources for his/her career\nplanning. On this front, we have recently launched a Career Progression\nModule, where we identify good talent within the organization and give them a\nboost in their career through training and interdisciplinary assignments. This\ntalent would be identified on the basis of past ratings and would be defined\nunder two major categories- The High Performers (HiPOS) and the Top Guns.\nWhere the HiPOS would be identified on the basis of excellent performance in\nthree consecutive quarters, the Top Guns would be identified with consistently\nexcellent performance in at least three quarters in their career at Cosmo\nFilms.\n\n **Reward & Recognition:- **Reward & Recognition System is aimed to accelerate\nthe pace of the employee performance in the most competitive way, ensuring\nhealthy completion to go the extra mile for the organization and get rewarded\nby an utmost transparent method. We have a very comprehensive system in place\nto identify deserving employees and reward them with several recognitions like\nSales Incentive Plan, Chairman\u2019s Award, CEO Award and monthly & quarterly\nincentives.\n\n **Empowerment and Authority:-** This is a cultural shift that is being\ninitiated by way of Empowerment & Autonomy by bringing a manager driven\nculture. Transparency is being built between the employee and their managers\nto reward the efforts of the employee by the most objective Performance\nManagement Systems. We have divided our system into three different E\u2019s-\nEnable, Empower and Excel.\n\na. Enable: Creating a culture that gives recognition, competency development\nopportunities, a healthy and safe working environment, and a process-driven\nculture.\n\nb. Empower: Giving employees a degree of autonomy and responsibility for\ndecision-making regarding their specific organizational tasks.\n\nc. Excel: To perform our responsibilities entrusted by the organization\nexceptionally well. Outstanding practices in managing the organization and\nachieving superior results.\n\n4\\. Supervision:- Competencies reflected in the employees are impacted by way\nof Supervisory Development Training, which is included in a new employee\ninduction program, buddy programs, technical as well as behavioral training-\non and off the job, development programs and plant visits for people working\nat remote locations. Additionally, some other initiatives started in the\ncompany, contributing towards a cultural change and capability building are-\n\n **Introduction of Human Resource Business Partner Concept: -** Now there are\ndedicated HR executives in the company who are closely working with all the\nvertical heads on their business requirements, various issues and concerns;\nand extending the support for smooth day to day operations.\n\n **Moving employees to the next level through Digital HR Practices:-** In the\ncurrent working environment, we have made it easy for employees to access HR\nservices and data from anywhere across the world with our automated HR through\nthe medium of Cosmo Intranet and SAP Success Factor. This is accessible to all\nemployees not only on their laptops but also through their smartphones.\n\n **Recruitment of Female Employees:-** In our plant in Shendra, Aurangabad,\nfemale Graduate Engineers are being recruited as GEL (Graduate Engineer\nLearners). They have done various good projects with us and given important\ninputs for the improvement in operations.\n\n **Launch of Cosmo Global Competencies:-** Cosmo Global competencies were\nlaunched in 2017 for all the employees and detailed training was given on 08\ncompetencies which should be acquired by all employees.\n\nWith these revisions and structures now in place, Cosmo Films has been able to\ncreate a viable working environment for its employees, and also placed the\ncompany as a great place to work for.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[Vipul Dave](/tags/Vipul-Dave-107296/) [Cosmo Films ltd.](/tags/Cosmo-Films-\nltd.-107297/) [COVID-19](/tags/COVID-19-105499/) [coronavirus\noutbreak](/tags/coronavirus-outbreak-103398/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

This tragic situation has exposed the\nvulnerability of the global supply chain and the lack of emphasis placed on\ncontingency planning.\n\nISO 22301:2019 _Security and resilience - Business continuity management\nsystems - Requirements_, is the world's leading international business\ncontinuity management standard (BCMS). ISO 22301 can help an organization\nestablish, implement, and maintain a BCMS that supports quality management\nsystem (QMS) integrity during natural disasters, including pandemics,\nenvironmental accidents, technology mishaps, and man-made crises impacting the\npublic and/or private sectors.\n\nThe benefits of implementing a BCMS include supporting the overall strategic\nobjectives, generating a competitive advantage, protecting organizational\nreputation, encouraging organizational success, and providing financial\nstability.\n\n**BCMS Requirements**\n\nThe requirements specified in ISO 22301:2019 are generic and are intended to\nbe applicable to all organizations regardless of type, size, and nature of the\norganization. The extent of BCMS requirements' applicability depends on the\norganization's environment, complexity, and the type of impact the\norganization may or may not accept following a disruption. A brief overview of\nthe requirements for each clause is provided.\n\n**_Clause 1: Scope._** ISO 22301 specifies requirements to plan, establish,\nimplement, operate, monitor, review, maintain, and continually improve a\ndocumented BCSM to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptive events\nwhen they arise. Establishing a BCSM is especially warranted when the\norganization must continue to deliver medicinal products and services during a\ndisruption.\n\n**_Clause 2: Normative References._** ISO 22301 has one normative reference\n(ISO 22300 _Security and resilience - Vocabulary_) and no informative\nreferences.\n\n**_Clause 3: Terms and Definitions._** ISO 22301 provides 31 terms and\ndefinitions used to support the standard's requirements, as well as the terms\ncontained in ISO 22300 _Security and resilience - Vocabulary. _\n\n**_Clause 4: Context of the Organization_** requires an understanding of the\norganization, its purpose, objectives, and context while considering the needs\nand expectations of interested parties in light of legal and regulatory\nrequirements. Organizations should consider using a risk-based approach,\nidentifying disruptive incidents and determining how those events could impact\nthe organization and, ultimately, customers and patients. When defining the\nscope of the BCMS, the organization is required to document and explain\nexclusions.\n\n**_Clause 5: Leadership_**. The organization's top management must ensure the\nbusiness continuity policy and business continuity objectives are compatible\nwith the company's strategic direction. Top management must demonstrate\nleadership and support for the organization and encourage employee\ninvolvement. Responsibility and authority for carrying out business continuity\nroles within the organization must be established.\n\n**_Clause 6: Planning._** The organization must identify and determine risks\nand opportunities that could influence organizational effectiveness and/or\nimpact operations. Appropriate action plans, proportional to the identified\nrisks and opportunities, must be developed. The business continuity objectives\nmust be consistent with the business continuity policy, communicated,\nmeasurable, monitored, and updated based upon the needs and expectation of\ninterested parties. When changes are made to the BCSM, system integrity and\npotential consequences must be considered.\n\n**_Clause 7: Support._** The organization needs to identify and provide the\nnecessary resources, including procedures, and communication tools. Competency\nrequirements should be determined for the people under the organization's\ncontrol (full-time, part-time, contractors, and consultants) who have an\nimpact on organizational performance, and ensure these people are aware of\ntheir responsibilities. Internal and external communications applicable to the\nBCMS must be established. A system is required for establishing, controlling,\nand updating documents necessary to support the BCMS.\n\n**_Clause 8: Operation._** The organization is required to plan and develop\nits BCMS processes by studying potential disruptions, analyzing business\nrisks, and setting priorities. A formal process should be established,\nimplemented, and maintained that can be used to evaluate and set business\ncontinuity and recovery priorities, objectives, and targets.\n\nResource requirements necessary to implement business continuity solutions\nalso must be considered, including people, information and data, physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., buildings, workplaces and other facilities, plus\nassociated utilities), equipment and consumables, information technology (IT)\nsystems, communication technology systems, transportation and logistics,\nfinance, and suppliers. The organization is required to periodically test the\neffectiveness of business continuity strategies and solutions, and seek\nopportunities to improve each.\n\n**_Clause 9: Performance Evaluation_**. The organization must determine how to\nmonitor and measure the performance and effectiveness of its processes. It\nalso must ensure the internal audit program is capable of determining whether\nthe system conforms to established requirements. Top management is required to\nreview the BCMS, at planned intervals, to ensure its continuing suitability,\nadequacy, and effectiveness.\n\n**_Clause 10: Improvement._** The organization is required to identify, react\nto, and evaluate nonconformities when they occur by implementing corrective\nactions to address causes, and then reviewing those actions' effectiveness.\nThe organization must continuously improve the system's performance,\nsuitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.\n\n**Risk Rating**\n\nOnce the organization has identified potential natural disasters and [man-made\ncrises](https://www.meddeviceonline.com/doc/how-to-ensure-qms-continuity-\nduring-leadership-transition-0001) that could disrupt the delivery of\nmedicinal products and services, each risk must be evaluated for its potential\nimpact to the company, its likelihood of occurrence, and overall risk response\n(Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1 -- _Example Risk Matrix_\n\nImpact\n\n  * Low impact on schedule, performance, compliance, ability to operate, etc.\n  * Moderate impact on schedule, performance, compliance, ability to operate, etc.\n  * High impact on schedule, performance, compliance, ability to operate, etc.\n\nLikelihood\n\n  * Low - rare, though possible\n  * Medium - could occur occasionally\n  * High - likely to occur\n\nRisk (Impact x Likelihood)\n\n  * Low - risks are largely acceptable, monitor the risk periodically for changes which may affect the risk\n  * Medium - control measures to mitigate the risk may be planned\n  * High - control measures to mitigate the risk must be planned. The continued effectiveness of control measures must be monitored periodically.\n\nRisk Response\n\n  * Low - no mitigation or analysis is required\n  * Medium - mitigation and analysis may be required\n  * High - mitigation and analysis are required\n\nWhile the list of events that can disrupt operations may be nearly the same\nfor most organizations, the impact and likelihood of each risk will vary\nsignificantly between organizations. For example, businesses located in\ncoastal areas, such as Los Angeles or Miami, have a greater chance to be\nstruck by a tsunami than a business located Dallas, Texas. A vertically\nintegrated company may not be affected as severely by a pandemic as a company\nthat is horizontally integrated and has a higher reliance on its supply chain.\nA rural facility will probably have a lower risk of terror attack than a\nfacility located in a large metropolitan city.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of issues to consider when developing a contingency\nplan. Please note, the table is meant as an example and is not meant to be all\ninclusive:\n\nTable 1 -- _Example Disruptive Events_\n\n**Planning**\n\nThe organization has to anticipate risk by planning, and then decide whether\nto accept, reduce, control, mitigate, transfer, or avoid each risk. Risks\nshould only be accepted when the benefits outweigh the potential risks; never\naccept unnecessary risk. The organization must develop and document, using a\nrisk-based approach, business continuity plans (procedures) consistent with\nthe BCMS policy and objectives.\n\nThe BCMS procedures must be proportionate to the identified risks (low,\nmedium, high) and:\n\n  * specifically define immediate actions to be taken during a disruption\n  * provide for and allow flexibility in response to the changing conditions of a disruption\n  * minimize the impact through implementation of appropriate solutions\n  * assign roles and responsibilities for execution and monitoring\n\nAs noted above, not every disruption poses the same level of threat to each\norganization. If the risk is assessed to be high, a mitigation and analysis\nplan must be developed. For a risk classified as medium, mitigation and\nanalysis may be required. In each case, the decision should be documented by\nthe BCMS team. For risks identified as low, no mitigation or analysis is\nrequired.\n\n**Documentation**\n\nDocumenting business continuity plans (procedures), risk assessments, and\ncommunication plans, in my opinion, is best accomplished with one\ncomprehensive document, referred to as a BCMS Manual. Having all of the\ninformation in one place greatly facilitates execution of the plan when a\ndisruption occurs.\n\nThe BCMS Manual can include call lists for employees, suppliers, and other\ninterested parties. It is best to have the documents printed in controlled\nbinders, in case the disruption includes a power loss and data system issues.\n\n**Communications**\n\nThe organization is required to develop a communications plan that enables\ntimely and effective communications to relevant interested parties during a\ndisruption. The communications plan should consider both internal and external\ninterested parties. Internally, it is important to communicate to employees\nany impact the disruption will have upon the organization, the current plan\nfor addressing the disruption, and how additional information will be shared.\n\nExternally, suppliers, partners, and other interested parties also should be\ninformed about the disruption and the organization's plan for addressing it.\nDepending on risk, some external parties could be contacted through email,\nwhile others may require a call or teleconference.\n\nAnother consideration for external communications is the local community.\nEffectively communicating with the local community can help protect\norganizational reputation and contribute to organizational success.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a wakeup call, demonstrating how\nwoefully unprepared most organizations are for a widespread global event. This\ntragic situation has exposed the vulnerability of the global supply chain and\nthe lack of emphasis placed on contingency planning. [Contingency\nplanning](https://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/doc/contingency-plans-an-\nessential-quality-management-system-risk-tool-0001) needs to be considered\nholistically, rather than as a simple focus on information and data systems,\nwhich typically is the case.\n\n**About the Author**\n\n**Mark Allen Durivage** has worked as a practitioner, educator, consultant,\nand author.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nYvette Kennedy\n\nVice President of Consulting at [Explorance](https://explorance.com/),\noverseeing how clients can make better decisions using journey analytics.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nIn the new talent economy and technology-enabled workforce, people managers\nare tasked more than ever to engage and create impactful experiences. As a\npeople leader, adapting to the level of feedback and being able to synthesize\ndata from multiple sources is critical. The traditional performance management\napproach \u2014 which has served us well in the past \u2014 no longer keeps up with the\ncontinuous model of feedback and coaching that the new employee experience\nrequires.\n\nEmployees want access to feedback, and they want to have it as they respond to\nchallenges or develop new skills. It's no different than how we use wearable\ntracking devices to determine if we have achieved our exercise goals and where\nwe have fallen short. This new standard of informing analytics and using them\nto make decisions is also how employees interpret their own experiences.\n\nThe old model of performance management relied on collecting performance data\nat defined intervals and synthesizing it back to the employee. In contrast,\nperformance management analytics involves a combination of collecting data\npoints on formalized experience and touch points to provide real-time\ninformation on performance feedback for leaders and individuals. An example is\nusing multirater feedback to assess competency growth. If you have a set of\ncompetencies that each employee is expected to achieve, sending routine\nfeedback on these over time provides data on how the individual is performing\nand substantiates it with feedback.\n\nThis creates an opportunity to change the interaction and hold more powerful\ncareer conversations. As feedback continues to come in, the individual uses it\nto adjust behavior or outcomes, and the supervisor can have more meaningful\nconversations. And imagine what managers could do if they had a pulse on their\nteam members' feedback all the time, regardless of the performance cycle.\n\nEmployees want more and consistent access to feedback to understand how their\nskills are developing and how learning is impacting their performance.\nManagers who integrate feedback into meaningful dialogue that is real time,\nrelevant and balanced create more engaged and coachable employees.\n\nThere are multiple ways to integrate on-demand feedback into your engagement\nexperience. Providing people managers with feedback is one approach. The\nopportunity to inform and shape the employee journey through the use of\nfeedback and analytics can be a huge asset.\n\nHarnessing the power of an active feedback program in your organization has\nmultiple applications:\n\n\u2022 Leveraging multirater feedback lets people managers focus on how to have\nbetter career conversations and align feedback directly with skill\ndevelopment. This informs learning, skill development and job growth.\n\n\u2022 Using benchmarking based on feedback data can provide employees with\nperformance data in real time. By creating peer benchmarking and providing a\nlevel of transparency for employees to see their progress against their own\npeer group instead of relying on a rating system, the cohort can establish the\nbenchmark for success.\n\n\u2022 Eliminating the \u201cone loud voice\u201d syndrome of feedback allows for gathering\nmultiple feedback points from across the organization. If a skill needs\nimprovement, employees tend to agree with feedback if it is consistent and\nfrom a variety of providers.\n\nIntegrating continuous feedback from both internal and external stakeholders\nallows the manager to go beyond just their own assumptions about performance\nand have a dialogue that is rooted in multiple stakeholders' feedback and\nperceptions. Utilizing continuous feedback puts credibility back into the\nprocess. The focus becomes the feedback rather than one person\u2019s assumptions\nor viewpoints.\n\nWhen we introduce more information into how an employee is doing and combine\nit with support and advice along the way, employees thrive and feel supported.\nPeople leaders also have better experiences and develop confidence in having\nengaging career conversations.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Yvette Kennedy](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2020/03/yvettekennedy_avatar_1584133276.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/yvettekennedy/\n\"Photo of Yvette Kennedy\")\n\n[Yvette\nKennedy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/yvettekennedy/)\n\nVice President of Consulting at [Explorance](https://explorance.com/),\noverseeing how clients can make better decisions using journey analytics.\n[Read Yvette Kennedy's full executive profile\nhere](https://profiles.forbes.com/u/d49dac76-93e1-4cde-bec0-6d260c1c90f3).\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nVice President of Consulting at [Explorance](https://explorance.com/),\noverseeing how clients can make better decisions using journey analytics.\n[Read Yvette Kennedy's full executive profile\nhere](https://profiles.forbes.com/u/d49dac76-93e1-4cde-bec0-6d260c1c90f3).\n\n Read Less\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Yvette Kennedy&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: A Performance Management Approach To Help Managers Have Better Coaching Conversations %0A Author: Yvette Kennedy %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/03/17/a-performance-management-approach-to-help-managers-have-better-coaching-conversations/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

As one\nof the more prominent independent financial advisory firms in Singapore, the\nmission has been to democratise financial advice for the ordinary Singaporean\ncitizen, and to that end the company has succeeded remarkably well, building\nits business but also reinforcing its reputation for quality and integrity.\nHubbis met with Yeo, who articulated the vision he and his two co-founders\nhave of building a firm that provides a top-quality service, that is\ninnovative and imaginative, and that is also dedicated to the community of\nSingapore, which of course is thoroughly befitting for someone who in his\nspare time is a pastor and a spiritual counsellor.**\n\nThe discussion opens with talent and the competency of advisers, with Yeo\nstressing the continuous drive to upgrade skills, capabilities and the value\nproposition for clients. \"It is our advisers who are in contact with the\nclients, not the firm,\" Yeo reports. \"Accordingly, the mission for us is to\nensure the highest quality and to make certain that we are fully supporting\nour advisers in the best and every way possible.\"\n\nIn its website literature, SYNERGY paints itself as a financial advisory firm\ndedicated to being proactive, progressive and reliable. \"We strive to be the\nnew standard in financial guidance, creating significant value for our\nclients,\" Yeo explains. \"Our approach is to present a genuinely caring face to\nthe clients and to offer them the best possible advice and outcomes. \"We are\nextremely focused on the pursuit of technological updates, training roadmaps,\nsupport platforms and initiatives that are thoughtfully designed to develop\nour advisers' competency. It empowers and motivates them to grow and develop,\nthereby customising unique solutions towards financial success for the\nclientele.\"\n\nHe adds that training modules such as the Foundation Training to Skillsets\nDevelopment, or Business Specialisation to Management Training are examples of\nthe types of training programmes that SYNERGY is committed to developing for\nits people.\n\nYeo explains that it is the firm that is at the centre of the proposition. \"At\nSYNERGY, we have from the outset aimed to grow collectively as one body,\npromoting a strong internal bond between management, advisers and support\nstaff,\" he says. \"These are not simply words; we believe in applying passion,\nintelligence and a forward-looking perspective to what we do. Thereby becoming\ntrusted financial advisers to our clients, providing them with customised\nsolutions. These solutions are crafted from our selected list of approved\nproducts of an extensive list of many life insurance companies and\nprofessional fund managers.\"\n\nYeo reports that SYNERGY is constantly challenging itself. \"As a company,\" he\nsays, \"we have innovated from the outset seven years ago, constantly looking\nat ways in which we can improve, to truly enhance our differentiation. These\nare the areas we are focused on: first is innovative product comparison. As an\nindependent firm exposed to over 30 insurance companies, one of the challenges\nour advisers face is to compare products between these companies.\"\n\n**SPEAR**\n\nTo achieve that, SYNERGY helped them with a methodology, SPEAR, which stands\nfor Synergy Product Evaluation Analysis Research. This is a formalised,\nstructured way through which our advisers can compare products and solutions.\n\"This helps them to dig down into the comparisons and present the findings\nclearly to the clients within 15 minutes\" Yeo reports.\n\nThe second key area for the firm has been utilising IT solutions to create\nvalue for its advisers. \"We began on this particular journey about two years\nago, and today we are almost like a software house, as we are developing our\nown software. For example, our 'Autobot' helps by giving timely information to\nour advisers as they advise their client. And we are dedicated to streamlining\nin line with digital transformation, whatever we can transform, we will\ntransform.\"\n\n**Digitising the proposition**\n\nYeo reports that today, the biggest department in SYNERGY is the IT\ndepartment. \"We used to outsource our IT, but since two years ago, we built IT\ninternally so we have our own developers, UX/UI designers, our own business\nanalysts, and although the ROI on IT is slow to emerge, we are delighted with\nthe results, especially as new ideas can be conceptualised and crystallised\ninto a product or service rapidly and effectively.\"\n\nYeo addresses the question as to whether SYNERGY can migrate clients to more\nof an advice-for-fee type model as it has become more prevalent in Australia,\nwhere commissions are rarer today. \"Our opinion is certainly that the fee-\nbased model is something that we want to do but the question is are we or the\nclients ready,\" he comments. \"In Asia, the model face high resistance to fees\nfor anything other than purchases of goods or products. We probably have the\nexpertise and infrastructure available to move to that model, we have the\ntechnology, but is Singapore ready for this? We have yet to see any success\nstory in this regard here, so for now we are not moving that way.\"\n\nAnd looking ahead to the next ten years, Yeo adds that the likelihood is that\nregulation will actually demand that fee-for-advice becomes the prevailing\nmodel. \"Singapore is changing rapidly in terms of its approach,\" he comments,\n\"so we do expect things to evolve and we are ready for that transition.\"\n\nFor example, SYNERGY can see potentially advisory fees for managing people's\nmoney in their Central Provident Fund, or CPF, which is effectively their\nstate retirement and welfare money they built up during their working lives.\n\n**Competition and regulation**\n\n\"Things will likely change relating to the management of people's pots in\ntheir CPFs,\" Yeo observes. \"And in terms of insurance products, the commission\nstructure has also been changing, with commissions more spread across time.\nSo, competition and regulation are both evolving to change the norms here.\nAlongside fee compression as well as more direct access to financial and\ninsurance products online, then clearly advisers will be challenged, and will,\ntherefore, need to further evolve. Those advisers who do not increase their\ncompetency level will struggle, as they need to compete with these online\nplatforms.\"\n\n**Anticipating change**\n\nYeo accordingly maintains that advisers should have a firm understanding of\nthe way technology will disrupt how they do business, a transition which\nSYNERGY facilitates. \"Just selling is not enough,\" he says. \"They need to give\nadvice; they need to really understand their products and clients in order to\nsurvive and do well. I will be honest and say that, perhaps only one third of\nadvisers can make this transition, but that is exactly why we are so dedicated\nto upgrading advisers' skills. We have time, the dramatic changes are not\ntaking place overnight, but they are taking place. We are anticipating these\nchanges and preparing our people for the day to come.\"\n\n**Excellence from the ground up**\n\nYeo explains that from the outset, the mission was to build a company of\nexcellence.\n\n\n\n> \"We came across the Business Excellence Framework several years ago, and in\n> February this year, we earned recognition as a Singapore company that has\n> achieved their Singapore Quality Class STAR (SQC STAR) with People and\n> Innovation. This is a prestigious national recognition for excellent\n> management practices, a commitment towards continuous improvement and\n> sustainable business performance.\"\n\n\n\nAnd SYNERGY is an esteemed company alongside some leading international and\nlocal Singapore companies and bodies, including names such as Attorney-\nGeneral's Chambers, Central Narcotics Bureau, Corrupt Practices Investigation\nBureau, Health Promotion Board, Ministry of Communications and Information,\namongst other private and state body names.\n\n\"We knew from the outset that we must get all our SOP [Standard Operating\nProcedures] right, to create and evolve the best practices and processes,\" Yeo\nadds. \"We also knew we wanted to track progress and be endorsed in this\nendeavour; hence we started our ISO journey, and obtained ISO9001 in 2015.\nSome staff wondered why we needed that, why do we need to pay for such an\naudit, to be policed effectively. But we wanted standards, we wanted to be\nconsistent, and we wanted to track our progress. And that then led to the\nSingapore Quality Class commendations, which represent an even more holistic\nview on the company, as they look beyond processes, they look at what we call\nthe seven pillars, including leadership, CRM, processes, knowledge, training,\nfinancial strength, and our results.\"\n\n**Shining a light**\n\nYeo explains that the journey has unveiled discoveries about the company that\nhave further enhanced its ability to evolve. \"And we are not static, we\ncontinually seek new ways to progress, so, for example, we are as I said\nalmost a software company in some respects, so we need rigorous standards for\nhow we manage data and security. Hence, we applied and achieved ISO27001\nrelating to the Information Securities Management System. That has helped us\nachieve a remarkably robust data management protocol, which is great for the\ncompany and for our clients.\"\n\nYeo closes the discussion by reiterating the firm's passion for excellence,\nfor its people, its clients and the community at large. \"We continue to strive\nfor growth and we know we can achieve that through dedication to quality,\nintegrity and excellence. These are challenging times today for us all amidst\nCovid-19, but we must believe that more normalised times will soon return, and\nwe will be prepared for the opportunities and challenges ahead.\"\n\n\n\n**Key Priorities for Synergy Financial Advisers**\n\n\"My first priority might be to reduce the number of priorities we have, as\nthere are quite a lot,\" Yeo quips jovially, when asked to define his core\nmissions for the year or two ahead. \"However, I will say that number one is to\ncomplete this journey of digital transformation we are now on. From a company\npoint of view, we need to harness technology so that we can really grow fast,\nbut we cannot just hire more people, we need full digital transformation to\nsupport that growth.\"\n\n \"We need to further build out the way our advisers are able to service the\nclients remotely, and this is something we are working towards, especially\nafter we have seen the chaos wrought by Covid-19. So, that's our next phase of\nthe journey.\"\n\nGrowth is the other priority. \"We want to grow and to acquire other businesses\nif we see good fits. But of course, to find the right businesses with the\nright fit is a challenge.\"\n\nYeo's final priority is further differentiation. \"In every aspect of what we\ndo, as a financial advisory firm, we must strive for greater differentiation,\nto really make us stand out from the competition,\" he states.\n\n\n\n**Getting Personal with Kelvin Yeo**\n\nYeo is a born and bred Singaporean, proud of his heritage and lucky enough to\nhave enjoyed education through to the prestigious Nanyang Technological\nUniversity, Singapore, or NTU, where he studied engineering. \"And right now,\"\nhe reports, \"I can also highlight that I am taking my Master's at the National\nUniversity of Singapore in Artificial Intelligence, part of my ongoing drive\nto develop more skills and to help the firm with the differentiating factors\nthat I mentioned earlier.\"\n\nAlthough his early working life was in engineering, he soon found his true\ninterest was in the financial advisory business, starting in the sector as an\ninsurance adviser with Manulife, and then moving fast to run his own agency,\nbefore he helped another independent financial advisory firm establish itself\nfrom the ground up for four years.\n\nThen he met Adrian Peh, now SYNERGY's CEO, and together with Jeff Lee, Chief\nBusiness Officer, they devised the plan for launching SYNERGY. \"That was\naround the time of the financial crisis, but we put it on hold then and\nstarted in 2013, amidst much better conditions,\" he recalls.\n\nYeo has been happily married for almost 20 years, and the couple have children\naged 17 and 16. His spare time might be spent as a part-time pastor in his\nnon-denominational church, something he has been committed to now for over a\ndecade and in which he finds great community spirit and personal fulfilment.\n\"And I also spend time at nights doing counselling work, and sometimes I even\npreach on Sundays,\" he reports.\n\nHe also enjoys the outdoor life, some modest exercise in the gym, running and\ngolf. \"We have also introduced a Thursday run for company members at the\nNational Stadium, so we close up a bit early, it is great to clear the mind\nand great for team spirit. As leaders of the firm, we are all into this; it\nreally is very rewarding.\"\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/img.hubbis.com/home_default_optimiser/img/individual/cropped/f5bd9ba4a92992bed56591fab637bb8517798205.JPG)\n\n[ Kelvin Yeo ](/articles/author/kelvin-yeo)\n\nChief Operating Officer at Synergy Financial Advisers\n\n[ ![](/img/advert/58c56a5ee9a89fa70b6dbb382f4e1ad19528ed11.png)\n](https://www.henleyglobal.com/?page=seahubbiswebsite) [\n![](/img/advert/fd1bff0608ac6b47daeac500dcc4e175d8a55a71.jpg)\n](https://hubbis.com/eventshighlight/middle-east-wealth-management-\nforum-2020-2020-1-21)\n\nMore from Kelvin Yeo, Synergy Financial Advisers\n\n[IFAs](/articles/topic/ifas)\n\n[Synergy Financial Advisers: A Singaporean Tale of Excellence, Dedication and\nPurpose](/article/synergy-financial-advisers-a-singaporean-tale-of-excellence-\ndedication-and-purpose)\n\nApr 1, 2020 [Kelvin Yeo](/articles/author/kelvin-yeo) of Synergy Financial\nAdvisers\n\nLatest Articles\n\n[Strategy & Practice Management](/articles/topic/strategy-practice-management)\n\n[Coronavirus Survival Guide for Wealth Managers](/article/coronavirus-\nsurvival-guide-for-wealth-managers)\n\nApr 7, 2020 [Shane Meredith](/articles/author/shane-meredith) of\n[Contemi](/partnerProfile/contemi/partner-content)\n\n[Thailand](/articles/topic/thailand)\n\n[Generali Life CEO in Thailand on Building its Proposition and Being 100%\nCustomer-Centric](/article/generali-life-ceo-in-thailand-on-building-its-\nproposition-and-being-100-customer-centric)\n\nApr 6, 2020 [Bundit Kenny Jiamanukoonkit](/articles/author/bundit-kenny-\njiamanukoonkit) of Generali\n\n[Digital & Technology](/articles/topic/digital-technology)\n\n[Seeing the Big Picture: Accenture\u2019s Michael Zwiefler on the Brave New World\nof Digital](/article/seeing-the-big-picture-accenture-s-michael-zwiefler-on-\nthe-brave-new-world-of-digital)\n\nApr 4, 2020 [Michael Zwiefler](/articles/author/michael-zwiefler) of Accenture\n\n[Wealth Solutions & Wealth Planning](/articles/topic/wealth-solutions-wealth-\nplanning)\n\n[Chia Sows the Seeds of Optimism: Vital Wealth Management Insights from\nSingCapital\u2019s CEO](/article/chia-sows-the-seeds-of-optimism-vital-wealth-\nmanagement-insights-from-singcapital-s-ceo)\n\nApr 3, 2020 [Alfred Chia](/articles/author/alfred-chia) of SingCapital\n\n[Private Banks](/articles/topic/private-banks)\n\n[DBS\u2019 Marc Lansonneur on Combining Art and Science for Private Banking of the\n2020s](/article/dbs-marc-lansonneur-on-combining-art-and-science-for-private-\nbanking-of-the-2020s)\n\nApr 3, 2020 [Marc Lansonneur](/articles/author/marc-lansonneur) of DBS Private\nBanking\n\n[Thailand](/articles/topic/thailand)\n\n[Robo-advisor Robowealth Sending Waves of Disruption through Thailand\u2019s\nGrowing Wealth Market](/article/robo-advisor-robowealth-sending-waves-of-\ndisruption-through-thailand-s-growing-wealth-market)\n\nApr 2, 2020 [Chonladet Khemarattana](/articles/author/chonladet-khemarattana)\nof Robowealth\n\n![](/bundles/app/home/images/icon_highlights.png) You might be interested in\n\n[All articles](/articles/)\n\n![](/bundles/app/home/images/logo_hubbis_white.png) [\n__](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hubbis \"https://twitter.com/hashtag/hubbis\") [\n__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hubbis\n\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/hubbis\")\n\n  * [Articles](/articles/) [Events](/events/) [Partners](/partnerProfiles/) [News](/news/) [Videos](/videos/)\n  * [ Thought Leadership ](/publications/) [ About ](/about/) [ Contact ](/contact-us/)\n\n[Terms & Conditions](/defaultCommon/terms-conditions) [Privacy\nPolicy](/defaultCommon/privacy-policy) [Cookie Policy](/defaultCommon/cookie-\npolicy)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Hubbis (HK) Limited.

In that year, the average player salary was $90,000.\n\nThe way the game of basketball was played then determined which competencies\n(i.e. skills) were of most value. At that time, it was the center position. In\nterms of income inequality, a popular measurement of labor statistics favored\nby French economists and a former candidate for president of the United\nStates, the difference of player income was a multiple of 5x. In that same\nyear, the US median household income was $13,779 and an unarmed security guard\nworking NBA arenas was making $3.50 per hour on average, $7,280 annually. The\nincome inequality measure between Jabbar and the average family was 33x.\n\nFast forward to 2020, and [the highest-paid player in the\nNBA](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries) is Steph Curry, making $40 million. The\ngame has changed; 3-point shooting is now perhaps the most valued competency.\nIn 2020, the average player in the NBA makes $7.7 million, roughly the same\nmultiple of income inequality at 5x. Stated another way, both NBA figures, the\ntop, and average contracts, represent a 10.5 percent CAGR (Compounded Annual\nGrowth Rate), demonstrating how much American and global consumers value the\nNBA.\n\nIn 2020, the US median household income is $63,688 and the average pay of the\nNBA security guard is $13.91 per hour, $32,429 per year. While the income\ninequality measure between the guard and the family remained constant at 2x\nover 45 years, as did the inequality between the top salary and the average\nsalary in the NBA, the income inequality between Curry and the average family\nincreased to 628x.\n\nWhat can explain such an increase?\n\nIf we were demonstrating this sort of income inequality in a profession\noutside of the NBA or using an entrepreneur as the example rather than Steph\nCurry, you can imagine the exasperated cries from many who are convinced\ncapitalism is an unfair economic system, perhaps even evil. Many make the\nunreasoned leap that the existence of an economic disparity between the top\nand bottom proves the existence of exploitation or structural unfairness.\n\nIn reality, it turns out that such unequal distributions are quite common.\nIt\u2019s as if they are governed by a natural law. Well, they are. There is a\nrecurring pattern in all facets of our life that demonstrates the extremely\nunequal distribution of creative production. It\u2019s called Price\u2019s Law.\n\n[Derek Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price), a\nBritish physicist, made the discovery that governs organizational output.\nEssentially, a small handful of people are always responsible for a large\nmajority of the value creation. Price\u2019s Law explains how this inequality\nexists in everything. Whether musicians, artists, writers or athletes, a small\nminority of people produce a majority of the most valuable things. It\u2019s why\nonly five composers have produced roughly 50 percent of all of the classical\nmusic we listen to. There is a hierarchy of competence that exists in\neverything.\n\n[The Pareto\nPrinciple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#:~:text=The%20Pareto%20principle%20\\(also%20known,from%2020%25%20of%20the%20causes.)\nis another helpful way to understand that inputs and outputs are not equally\ndistributed. The Italian economist, [Vilfredo\nPareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) observed that 80\npercent of the wealth in his country was controlled by 20 percent of the\npopulation. As he discovered, the same was true in other countries. Nearly\neverywhere we look, a minority outscores the majority in wealth because a few\npeople have mastered the competency of their realms. We can look again to\nsports to see this play out in teams and leagues.\n\nOf the 25 million people who play golf in America, only a few hundred of them\nare able to have a competency level high enough to play on the PGA Tour each\nyear. And within that elite group, the Pareto Principle and Price\u2019s Law hold\ntrue. Brooks Koepka started 21 tournaments in 2019 and earned $9,684,006 in\nprize money. Rod Pampling also started 21 tournaments in 2019. He earned\n$102,127.\n\nDoes this suggest the rules of the game were unfair? Did Koepka cheat? No, the\nresults were simply unequal.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the NHL, where Connor McDavid is the highest-paid player at\n$12,500,000. Anthony Richard is also a center in the NHL. He makes $688,333.\nMcDavid scored 116 points (41 goals, 75 assists) in 2019; Richard did not\nscore. Are Canadians up in arms over this?\n\nWhat about the NFL? The Pittsburgh Steelers have Ben Roethlisberger and Paxton\nLynch under contract as quarterbacks. Roethlisberger makes $36,042,682; Lynch\nmakes $735,000. In 2018, Roethlisberger threw 34 TDs; Lynch threw two in 2017.\nIn Seattle, Russell Wilson earns $31 million per year as the starting\nquarterback of the Seattle Seahawks. He threw 31 TDs last year. Cody Thompson\nis also a QB on the Seahawks roster. He makes $510,000 annually.\n\nIf we go across the pond to the English Premier League, will we find a more\negalitarian system based on an equal distribution of compensation? The top\ngoalkeeper in the EPL is David De Gea. The Spanish wizard has a record of 167\nwins and 65 losses, including an astonishing 107 clean sheets. De Gea is paid\n\u00a319,500,000 per year. The lowest-paid goalkeeper in the EPL is Pontus Dahlberg\nat \u00a3156,000. Dahlberg is yet to make an appearance in an EPL match.\n\nReturning to the NBA, what about a favorite of social justice advocates,\nLeBron James? In the 2019 season, James averaged 25.5 points and 10.5 assists\nand earned $31 million in salary, which was roughly 30 percent of the Lakers\u2019\ncap space. Talen Horton-Tucker is also a player on the Lakers. He earned\n$898,310, despite averaging zero points and one assist per game.\n\nIn other words, the NBA has become such a valuable form of entertainment\naround the globe that a benchwarmer today is making what Kareem Abdul Jabbar\nmade in 1975 ([in inflation adjusted\ndollars)](https://westegg.com/inflation/). And that\u2019s a good thing. While we\nfocus on how much Steph Curry makes at the compensation ceiling, what we need\nto recognize is how much players are making on the compensation floor. The\ndifference in compensation is not a result of bias; it\u2019s a result of a\nmeritocracy that rewards value creation. No NBA players are being exploited.\n\nWhat these salaries reveal is the liberating nature of free enterprise. It\nworks beyond sports, too.\n\nFree enterprise gives opportunity to the creative and encourages productive\nactions. There is no other way to explain the substantial decline in extreme\npoverty in the world over the past 40 years. In the 1980s, 40 percent of the\nworld lived in extreme poverty. Today, 8.6 percent do. Instead of focusing on\nthe income gap, we should keep raising the floor.\n\nYes, the rich are getting richer. But who says they are doing so at the\nexpense of the poor? Well, lots of people. The list includes French\nsocialists, economics professors at Harvard, Project 1619 contributors at _The\nNew York Times_ , Bernie Sanders, CNN commentators, even some professional\nathletes.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if these people believe attacks on the rich will lead to a more\nprosperous society, but when citizens start to believe this popular fiction,\nit leads to a strong resentment against the most creative producers in our\nsociety. It feeds the belief that these producers obtained their wealth by\nstealing it from others.\n\nThis can lead to destructive public policies, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s\n[wealth tax](https://fee.org/articles/why-a-billionaire-wealth-tax-would-hurt-\nthe-working-poor-and-the-middle-class/). Rather than focusing on attempting to\nnarrow the gap between rich and poor, we should focus on expanding economic\ngrowth.\n\nThat\u2019s what the professional sports leagues have done over the past four\ndecades, and there are many more millionaires as a result.\n\n![Jon L.\nPritchett](/media/35451/jon.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&height=100&widthratio=1&rnd=132122549670000000)\n\n#####  [ Jon L.

That number has more than quadrupled in\ntwo weeks. In addition, six patients have tested positive and one elderly\npatient has died. Claudio said with each additional positive case, her fear\nrises. \u201cWe could all potentially already be exposed, but not showing symptoms\nso the level of anxiety is high,\u201d Claudio said.\n\nUntil recently, employees at WSH were not allowed to bring their own masks\nfrom home. But that changed last week after the Washington Federation of State\nEmployees (WFSE), a union representing more than 2,000 workers at the\nhospital, raised the issue with Department of Social and Health Services\n(DSHS) management.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no justifiable reason to prevent staff from wearing their\nown/homemade masks to protect their co-workers from unknown exposure,\u201d the\nunion wrote in an email.\n\nLast Tuesday, DSHS changed its policy. In a memo to staff, the agency said\nmasks from home would be allowed to \u201creduce risk\u201d and \u201creduce concerns.\u201d The\nnew policy also applies to staff at Eastern State Hospital (ESH) and at the\nstate\u2019s Residential Habilitation Centers for the developmentally disabled.\n\nBut with permission came a warning.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that if you choose to wear your own face mask, you will be\ndoing so at your own risk,\u201d wrote Sean Murphy, the assistant secretary for\nbehavioral health at DSHS.\n\nThe reversal of policy came amidst changing state and federal guidance on\npersonal masks, a persistent shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE)\nand a steady increase in the number of employees testing positive for COVID-19\nat Western State Hospital.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some mixed messages around wearing personal masks, that guidance\nhas evolved,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had a change in\npractice along the way, we\u2019re learning with all the rest of the world in how\nto handle this virus.\u201d\n\nDSHS\u2019s policy of allowing staff to bring masks from home contrasts with a\n[recent announcement](https://doc.wa.gov/news/2020/04032020p.htm) from the\nWashington Department of Corrections (DOC) that it will start issuing expired\nN95 masks to front line staff in the state\u2019s 12 prisons, 12 work release\ncenters and those who work in community supervision. So far, 10 DOC staff and\ntwo incarcerated individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. The first of\nthose inmates was already hospitalized in the community for an unrelated\nmedical issue.\n\nMurphy said he couldn\u2019t comment on DOC\u2019s approach, but that his agency is\nfollowing state Department of Health (DOH) guidance and reserving medical\nmasks for staff assigned to care for patients with flu-like symptoms and those\nwho have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough supplies to issue masks out to all of our staff and\nmaintain that issuance level for a long period of time, so part of this is a\nconservation effort,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThe battle over the masks is just one indication of ongoing tensions between\nfront line staff and management at WSH, a sprawling 857-bed facility with more\nthan 2,600 employees in Lakewood.\n\nIn recent weeks, WFSE and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)\n1199, which represents approximately 400 nurses at WSH, have sent management\nstrongly worded letters and emails about staff safety and demanded bargaining\nmeetings.\n\nSEIU 1199 said it has sent 50 communications and demanded more than 10\nbargaining sessions, of which, the union said, there have been two.\n\nAn SEIU 1199 spokesperson said some of the union\u2019s demands have already been\nmet, but others have not, including a request for paid administrative leave,\nin lieu of sick leave, for workers who contract COVID-19. The union has also\nasked that all patients at the hospital be tested for the virus.\n\n\u201cOur overall assessment is that decisions made related to COVID-19 at Western\nState have been reactionary, not evidence-based and do not account for long-\nterm impacts,\u201d Amy Clark, the spokesperson, wrote in an email.\n\nIn almost daily communications with the state, WFSE said it has made similar\ndemands of DSHS and hospital officials and has also requested formal\nbargaining \"due to ongoing safety issues.\"\n\nIn response, DSHS said that it\u2019s continually evolving its response to the\ncrisis as public health guidance changes.\n\nFor example, on March 29, the hospital created a separate ward for patients\nwho test positive for COVID-19 -- something the unions had requested.\n\nLast week, following a request to DSHS from SEIU, a team from DOH that\nincluded the state\u2019s epidemiologist for communicable diseases toured the\nhospital and made a series of recommendations.\n\nIn response, this week DSHS announced that all staff assigned to ward S-8\nwhere several of the COVID-19 cases have been detected will be tested for the\nvirus.\n\nHowever, that falls short of what the unions wanted. In a March 31 email, WFSE\nExecutive Director Leanne Kunze requested testing for all staff and patients\n\u201cwho have been in any ward in the South Hall.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the challenge of keeping COVID-19 from spreading, WSH is\ndealing with an ongoing staffing shortage that has been exacerbated by the\npublic health crisis.\n\nWith strict screening in place to keep sick employees out, Murphy said more\nemployees are taking sick leave. Also, some front line staff who are\nespecially vulnerable to COVID-19 have been reassigned to work from home or in\nlower-risk settings. SEIU 1199 confirmed Tuesday that 100 of its nurses who\nare high-risk have been granted telework for two weeks.\n\nThe staffing shortage, in turn, has made it difficult to restrict the movement\nof staff between wards, which the unions have flagged as an additional health\nrisk.\n\nIn an effort to address that problem, Murphy said that this week nurse\nsupervisors were redeployed to work on the floors.\n\nThere have also been unforeseen complications.\n\nFor instance, last month WSH started screening employees for symptoms of\nCOVID-19 when they arrived for work. Initially, that screening process was\ndelayed while the hospital awaited a shipment of thermometers. But once the\nthermometers arrived, another problem arose. As staff came in from outdoors to\nbe screened, Murphy said the thermometers were not taking accurate readings.\n\nMurphy said the hospital has now ordered a different kind of thermometer, but\nbecause they\u2019re in short supply delivery isn\u2019t imminent. In the meantime, WSH\nhas stopped taking the temperatures of staff. Instead, workers arriving for\ntheir shift now sign an attestation that says they don\u2019t have COVID-19\nsymptoms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a far stretch to ask health care workers to monitor themselves for\nsymptoms, make sure that they\u2019re ensuring that they don\u2019t have a temperature\nprior to coming to work,\u201d Murphy said, noting that attestation is used in\nother healthcare settings.\n\nBut WFSE\u2019s executive director, in her March 31 email, said the attestation\nprocess had created misunderstanding among staff and wrote that it \u201cfeels more\nlike a mitigation of liability.\u201d\n\nThe strongly worded email also alleged a lack of coordination and\ncommunication \u201cbordering on negligence\u201d and urged WSH to seek outside help.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the luxury of time to pretend it\u2019s going to be okay at WSH\n(and other locations) when it clearly is not,\u201d the email said.\n\nIn response, Murphy said his agency is in daily contact with the unions and\nthat suggestions that come from the unions or from employees are reviewed and\nconsidered. He also acknowledged the challenge of battling a fast-moving virus\nwhen someone can be asymptomatic and still be contagious.\n\n\u201cIt makes it very difficult to keep it from coming in to the institution,\u201d\nMurphy said, adding that they\u2019re monitoring the situation closely.\n\nAnother prong of the fight to keep COVID-19 in check at WSH involves reducing\nthe census. The facility is in the process of trying to rapidly find community\nplacements for up to 60 civil or non-criminal patients who are ready to\ndischarge. The Associated Press was the[ first to\nreport](https://apnews.com/c626f0f3b146ffe02e9ee6a59b169e12) on this effort.\n\nMurphy said the hospital is also limiting new admissions and sending some\npatients who would ordinarily go to WSH to ESH instead.\n\nSeveral advocacy groups want the state to go much further and employ \u201cnon-\ntraditional\u201d methods to release even more patients. Last Friday, Disability\nRights Washington, the ACLU of Washington, Columbia Legal Services and other\norganizations [sent a\nletter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6827215-Request-to-DSHS-to-\nReduce-WSH-ESH-Population-4-2.html) to DSHS Secretary Cheryl Strange\nrequesting that she act immediately to reduce the populations at WSH and ESH \u2013\nnoting that both facilities are near capacity and patients often share rooms.\n\nWhile applauding the agency\u2019s efforts to keep patients and staff safe, the\nletter called for the temporary release of some civil patients, the release of\nother civil patients to what\u2019s known as a Less Restrictive Alternative in the\ncommunity and the furlough of some forensic patients who have been found not\nguilty by reason of insanity, if they've already been granted conditional\nrelease status.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting that DSHS be aggressive and creative in reducing the\npatient population at WSH and ESH, but we are not advocating release to\nhomelessness or otherwise dangerous situations,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is just the latest crisis to buffet the state\u2019s largest\npsychiatric hospital. In 2018, WSH [lost its federal\naccreditation](https://www.nwnewsnetwork.org/post/western-state-hospital-lose-\ncertification-53-million-federal-funding), and with it $53 million in funding,\nafter a turnaround effort fell short. The hospital has also struggled to serve\ncivil patients while also meeting a [court-ordered\nrequirement](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sesa/office-communications/media-\nrelease/federal-judge-gives-final-approval-trueblood-settlement-agreement) to\nprovide competency evaluation and restoration services to individuals in jail.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee and lawmakers have now committed to a multiyear effort to move\nmost civil patients out of the aging hospital and into new community-based\nfacilities, while turning WSH into what Inslee calls a \u201cforensic center of\nexcellence.\u201d\n\nBut for now the crisis at hand is overshadowing those long-term goals, which\nare part of a broader effort to shore up and modernize the state\u2019s behavioral\nhealth system.\n\nFor psychiatric social worker Maria Claudio, going to work at a state\npsychiatric facility has always carried some risk because of the\nunpredictability of the patients. But now, she said, it feels like she\u2019s\nwalking into a \u201cdeath trap waiting to happen.\" She worries about bringing\nCOVID-19 home to her husband and children. But she also has the flexibility to\nwork from home on some days \u2013 a luxury many of her colleagues don\u2019t have.\n\nThat\u2019s why Claudio said she's drafted her Army husband to help cut fabric\npatterns and solicited donations of parachute cord from other Army families so\nshe can sew masks at home.

continuous professional development of the capital market industry**_\n  * _**To benefit Malaysian capital market employees, corporate users, training providers**_\n\n\n\n![SIDC launches Capital Market Competency Management\nSystem](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/sites/default/files/images/Securities%20Commission%20and%20SIDC.jpg)\n\n\n\nSECURITIES Industry Development Corporation (SIDC), the learning and\ndevelopment arm of the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), on Feb 21 launched\nits Capital Market Competency Management System (CMS), an innovative online\nindustry-wide utility platform that centralises the Industry Competency\nFramework (ICF), assessment and development activities on a common hub.\n\nThe CMS, launched by SC chairman Syed Zaid Albar, is an online solution that\nfacilitates continuous professional development of the capital market industry\nthrough assessment of competencies as prescribed by the ICF and the\nidentification of specific learning and development interventions.\n\nIn 2017, SIDC rolled out the ICF, the first comprehensive capital market\ncompetency framework in Malaysia comprising 58 competency titles and covering\n105 job roles across the main regulated activities.\n\nBased on the ICF, the CMS empowers individuals and/or corporations to assess\nand identify their own or their employees' existing competency levels and\ndevelopment areas.\n\nSet to be the game changer for capacity building and professional development\nof the Malaysian capital market, the CMS will feature the ICF repository, a\nSelf-Assessment Tool, and a personalised development guide (the Development\nAdvisor) based on the individual's self-assessment report that includes\nsuggested training courses as well as self-directed learning elements.\n\nSIDC chief executive officer Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali said, \"CMS is a\ndisruption tool which can help overcome the insurmountable challenges and pave\nthe map for the unknowns. Not only the future employees will be able to get\nthemselves ready for the market, but the culture of lifelong learning is\ningrained in the mindset of existing employees.\"\n\nShe also encouraged industry players to support and participate in this\nimportant endeavour together, to achieve the common and shared goals of\nproducing future-ready capital market professionals.\n\nThe CMS is designed to benefit Malaysian capital market employees, corporate\nusers, training providers and just about anyone aspiring to have a career in\nthe capital market.\n\nFor more information or

British Columbia, April 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qu Biologics\nInc. (Qu), a biopharmaceutical company developing _[Site Specific\nImmunomodulators](https://www.qubiologics.com/what-we-do/how-ssis-work/)_\n(SSIs), a unique platform of microbial-based immunotherapies designed to\nrestore the body\u2019s innate immune system, has published for the first time the\nbasis of their first-in class therapy. The series of studies, published this\nweek in [_Scientific\nReports_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62735-z), show that SSIs\nactivate and mobilize cells of the innate immune system to enhance and\nreinforce immune and barrier function of target organs to treat or prevent\ndisease. Scientists from Canada, the US and the Netherlands contributed to\nthis pivotal work.  \n\nThe innate immune system is the first line of defense against both infectious\nand non-infectious threats, and it is the critical part of the immune system\nresponsible for providing protection against new infectious agents when\nadaptive immune memory is lacking. The scientists at Qu Biologics and their\ninternational collaborators have demonstrated that cells of the innate immune\nsystem can be trained to be on alert and recruited to specific organs that\neither have disease present or are under imminent threat of disease. This\nprimed army of innate immune cells is not only more efficient at tackling new\npathogens but is also very well-equipped in clearing cancer cells and\nimproving barrier function in the targeted organ.\n\n\u201cThe concept of trained innate immunity has only relatively recently come to\nbe appreciated, and its full clinical potential has yet to be tapped,\u201d stated\nDr. Shirin Kalyan, an author of the study and Qu\u2019s Director of Scientific\nInnovation. \u201cThis collective work shows that we can both harness and direct\nthe potent effector functions of innate immunity to help overcome a\npotentially broad range of important diseases associated with immune\ndysfunction. This could be a game changer.\u201d\n\nPhysician and Qu\u2019s CEO, Dr. Hal Gunn, noted, \u201cAt this time when the world is\ngrappling with the pandemic of a serious respiratory virus, this work\ndemonstrating that SSI treatment can functionally enhance immune competency in\nspecific organ sites to reduce morbidity against different infectious agents\nis of immense relevance. We believe the application of SSIs is particularly\nideal for new emerging infectious threats, such as COVID-19, where there is no\nadaptive memory present. Our clinical experience with SSI treatment to date\nshows a very good safety profile, and we are motivated to help address this\nurgent need for high risk groups, such as healthcare workers on the frontlines\nand those with reduced immune function. We are currently looking for\npartnerships and collaborations to support this important work in overcoming\nthe COVID-19 crisis.\u201d\n\nQu\u2019s SSI\u2019s have been used clinically for the treatment of [_lung\ncancer_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2162402X.2017.1398875),\n[_ulcerative\ncolitis_](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02211/full?)\nand two Phase 2 trials for [_Crohn\u2019s\ndisease_](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2019.00170/full),\none of which is underway and has completed enrolment for its first stage.\nProof-of-concept studies have also been completed for the treatment of\n[_COPD_](https://respiratory-\nresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-017-0577-y) and\n[_asthma_](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35338?proof=trueMay%2F) using\nQu\u2019s lung-targeting SSI.\n\nFor more information about Qu Biologics and the science behind SSIs, please\nvisit _[www.qubiologics.com](http://www.qubiologics.com/)_.\n\n **About Qu Biologics**  \nQu Biologics is a Vancouver-based private clinical stage biopharmaceutical\ncompany developing Site Specific Immunomodulators (SSI), a novel class of\nimmunotherapies. SSIs are designed to stimulate an innate immune response in\ntargeted organs or tissues to reverse the chronic inflammation underlying many\nconditions including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory lung\ndisease and arthritis. SSIs are a broad platform technology being tested in\nmultiple disease indications, including Health Canada approved clinical trials\nin lung cancer, Crohn\u2019s disease and Ulcerative Colitis.\n\nBacked by a prestigious group of scientific advisors and board members, Qu\nBiologics is led by a management team that includes co-founder and CEO Dr. Hal\nGunn, a physician and expert on the body\u2019s immune response to chronic disease;\nand Chief Medical Officer Dr. Simon Sutcliffe, former CEO of the BC Cancer\nAgency and a distinguished clinician, scientist and leader in cancer control\nin Canada and internationally.\n\nFor more information regarding this press release, contact:\n\nHal Gunn, MD  \nCEO Qu Biologics Inc.  \nPhone: (1) 604.734.1450  \nEmail: _[media@qubiologics.com](mailto:media@qubiologics.com)_  \n\nStory continues\n\n _Qu Biologics Inc. cautions you that statements included in this press\nrelease that are not a description of historical facts may be forward-looking\nstatements.

[Nate\nDvorak](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=167717)\n\n![Rethinking Competencies, Part 1: 7 Expectations for\nLeaders](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/pscquacgyuckin9mmwcf1q.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * A broken competency model makes everyone's job harder than it needs to be\n  * HR needs to reevaluate the behaviors that actually contribute to success\n  * Start by aligning job descriptions with strengths and development\n\n_This article is the first in a series about rethinking competency behaviors,\nfeedback and programs._\n\nThe simplest way to be clear about behavioral expectations for leaders is to\ncommunicate which behaviors achieve the results your business wants -- not\nwith a list of competencies that may or may not link to outcomes. Companies\nthat don't examine the behaviors that lead to the desired outcomes are liable\nto confuse leaders about what is expected of them.\n\nThat's not at all unusual. Though knowing what is expected of them at work is\nan employee's most fundamental need, [Gallup's 2017 _State of the American\nWorkplace_ report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-\nworkplace-report-2017.aspx) found that only six in 10 employees know what\nthose expectations are. What's more, just 41% strongly agree that their job\ndescription aligns well with the work they are asked to do.\n\nThe lack of clear expectations and accurate job descriptions creates an ever-\npresent fear of being exposed as incompetent and being punished for it.\n\nAnd managers may be worse off than the teams they lead. According to Gallup's\nfirst perspective paper in a series on this topic, [_The Manager Experience:\nTop Challenges & Perks of\nManagers_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259820/manager-experience-\nchallenges-perk-perspective-paper.aspx), managers are:\n\n>   * 15 percentage points more likely to say they have multiple competing\n> priorities\n>   * four points less likely to say their job description is clear or that it\n> aligns to the work they do\n>   * six points more likely to feel stress during a lot of the workday\n>   * 11% less likely to strongly agree they get to do what they do best every\n> day.\n>\n\nThe lack of clear expectations and accurate job descriptions creates an ever-\npresent fear of being exposed as incompetent and then being punished for it.\nLeaders have a real incentive to meekly accept lists of competency\nrequirements, even if the requirements don't align with their role.\n\nConsequently, HR's performance reviews can't be entirely realistic or\ncomprehensive. When HR must rely on an ambiguous, inconsistent, contradictory\narray of traits, skills, capabilities, knowledge, behaviors, and\nresponsibilities -- and trust, this describes far too many competency models\n-- the job is far more difficult than it has to be.\n\nWhat HR needs, what _all_ leaders and managers need, is a fresh look at the\nbehaviors that actually contribute to performance, development and success.\n\n### **Competencies 2.0: The 7 Expectations for Leadership Behavior**\n\nRecently, Gallup researchers conducted a study involving more than 550 job\nroles and 360 unique job competencies. It showed that leaders achieve success,\ndespite varied roles, organizations, and industries, by focusing on the\nbehaviors within these seven expectations:\n\n**1\\. Build relationships.** Establish connections with others to build trust,\nshare ideas and accomplish work.\n\n**2\\. Develop people.** Help others become more effective through strengths\ndevelopment, clear expectations, encouragement and coaching.\n\n**3\\. Lead change.** Recognize that change is essential, set goals for change\nand lead purposeful efforts to adapt work that aligns with the stated vision.\n\n**4\\. Inspire others.** Encourage others through positivity, vision,\nconfidence, challenge and recognition.\n\n**5\\. Think critically.** Seek information, critically evaluate the\ninformation, apply the knowledge gained and solve problems.\n\n**6\\. Communicate clearly.** Listen, share information concisely and with\npurpose, and be open to hearing opinions.\n\n**7\\. Create accountability.** Identify the consequences of actions and hold\nyourself and others responsible for performance.\n\nChanging the expectation from a focus on competency to behavior instead allows\norganizations and their leaders to focus on the critical expectations of the\njob, not the things no one can control (e.g., idiosyncrasies), overly specific\nrequirements (e.g., specific knowledge), and unrealistic aspirations (e.g.,\nirrelevant skills).\n\nWhat HR needs, what all leaders and managers need, is a fresh look at the\nbehaviors that actually contribute to performance, development and success.\n\nAnyone can gear their actions toward an expectation, though everyone does so\nin their own way. A leader's \"own way\" can be identified and measured with the\nCliftonStrengths assessment. [People who know and use their\nCliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx) are:\n\n>   * 6x as likely to be engaged at work\n>   * 7.8% more productive in their role\n>   * 3x as likely to have an excellent quality of life\n>   * 6x as likely to do what they do best every day\n>\n\nThe CliftonStrengths assessment provides a common language with which to\napproach human development that necessitates individualization, allowing\nleaders to bring their own strengths to bear for each of these behaviors.\nThere is no more effective way to empower leaders than to see each person in\nterms of their strengths.\n\nAnd, ultimately, successful performance _is_ the expectation for leaders.\nPerformance is the criteria HR should be evaluating and coaching toward.\n\nLeaders ought to ask, without fear of consequences, if their role expectations\nare in their job description, if their behaviors help them meet those\nexpectations, and if the development they get is the help they need to achieve\nthe desired outcomes.\n\nThough leaders are often judged on their ability to conform to a competency\nlist, companies are judged for their success. Achieving success can't happen\nthrough muddled, ineffective leadership behavior. A good faith examination of\nbehaviors may take some energy and nerve, but it encourages leaders to do what\nthey do best -- and their companies, too -- that's the competency that matters\nmost.\n\n### **Rethink the route to success:**\n\n  * Want to learn more about competencies?

[Articles](/jrnl/recent)\n\n**A New Role for Joint Civil-Military Interaction**\n\nThomas Maty\u00f3k and Sre\u010dko Zajc\n\nGlobal crises, such as the spreading of the novel corona virus (COVID-19),\nhybrid threats and asymmetric warfare require civil-military interaction\nresponses guided by a unity-of-aim approach to build-up capacity for\nsuccessful conflict transformation. No single activity has a monopoly on\nresponses. All of society is required to act collaboratively in replying to\ndemands placed on it by emerging threats.\n\nWe ask: What can civil and military leaders and operators responding to\ncrises, hybrid threats, and asymmetric warfare learn from medical approaches\nto disease prevention and intervention? Like the drunk looking for lost keys\nunder the streetlight because the light is better there irrespective of the\nfact that they were dropped in the dark lot across the street, we often fail\nto search for answers in places because of the dark. We seem content to\ncontinue doing what is comfortable, not what is required.\n\nWe also question what crisis response actors, medical experts, politicians,\ncivil protection volunteers, etc. can learn from military responses to\nconfronting complex and potentially dangerous situations? And more generally,\nare we looking into the face of ignorance, lack of will, and hidden agendas\nsupported by those who might profit the most from different crises or is it\nsimply a lack of a systematic approach (we may call it comprehensive) at\nnational and international levels (for example EU, NATO, UN)? Lastly, how do\ncrisis management curricula and pre-crisis exercises fail at all levels of\neducation?\n\nViolent conflict is a disease, though disease is not violent conflict, per-se.\nViolence as a disease may develop into limited or wide spreading violent\nconflict when gun cultures prevent governments and citizens from acting\nintelligently and crafting healthy public policy, for instance. Needed are\ncreative responses to emerging threats; ones that recognize the need for\ncomprehensive approaches in eliminating the many manifestations of violent\nconflict. We must develop new, proactive operational paradigms to address\nconflict and cease reacting to violence.\n\nClearly, to find the correct answers to complex problems it is necessary to\nask the proper questions. A wrong hypothesis will only arrive at a wrong\nconclusion. Our goal in this paper is to focus on developing the right\nquestions that will lead to theory-informed answers regarding new and emerging\nroles for military forces in responding to crises, hybrid threats and\nasymmetric warfare. In the end, conflict analysis and resolution theory must\nbe integrated into higher education, professional development, trainings,\nexercises and useful apps for use by the general public in responding to\nemerging threats. To act in a concerted, unity-of-aim approach individuals and\norganizations must have access to timely research and education regarding\ncrisis response.\n\nThinking outside-of-the-box has become a well-worn phrase meant to help\nindividuals and organizations imagine new and innovative ways to build\nsecurity and peace in a world subjected to increasing asymmetry. Blocking new\nways forward, however, is that we often unthinkingly search for answers within\na closed system. We assume a finite set of responses. We remain in-the-box\nwhile trying to think outside of it. This can result in our doing little more\nin crises than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic when what is\nrequired is a better ship.\n\nIf we choose to be guided by closed system thinking we must accept there is\nlittle reason to ask the military what their answer is to current and future\nnational security and defense questions; nor should we only ask civilians. We\nwill need to accept there are only a finite range of responses, and nothing\nmore. We do not believe this should be the way forward. Our addition to the\ndiscussion of addressing crises, hybrid threats, and asymmetry is that we need\nto engage open systems thinking where the number of potential responses to\nthreats are limited only by our imagination, knowledge, and intellectual\ncuriosity.\n\nIn this paper we question if military and non-military operators are educated\nand trained properly to address threats and engage in coordinated responses,\nas well as what might be the role of civil society, governments, Non-\nGovernmental Organizations (NGOs), International Organizations (IOs), and\nGovernmental Organizations (GOs) in meeting future crises? Are they educated,\ntrained and able to work together collaboratively and cooperatively? Can they\ninteract positively in a constantly chaotic, fragile, and dynamic operational\nenvironment?\n\nNeeded is a profound, as well as nuanced, understanding of security and the\npotential for the transformation of a health crisis, for example, as well as\nother hybrid threats into asymmetric warfare. Is asymmetric merely the\nopposite of symmetric warfare or is it different in kind? If asymmetric\nwarfare is simply the reverse of symmetric than existing asymmetric responses\nshould be enough, the opposite of symmetric. That has not proved the case. The\nnumbers of special operating forces employing asymmetric methods now comes\nclose to the number of conventional forces. Are we prepared to address\nasymmetry with asymmetric approaches to defense and security; thereby building\nan asymmetric fortress? How are resilient and anti-fragile systems forms of\nasymmetric offense and defense? Is it more useful to focus on the current\nstate as continuous, a condition of permanent crisis and global chaos or look\nto creation of future sustainable states able to battle against crises and\nhybrid threats in asymmetric environments? Is globalization a sustainable\nmodel of how we should run our Planet? Does globalization result in more, or\nless borders on the ground, between states, in governance systems and in\nunderstanding the living environment?\n\nAs for many phenomena today which we do not fully understand, crises, hybrid\nthreats and asymmetrical warfare cannot escape our desire for certainty in\nsearching for options, even conducting experiments, so we can write down the\nmost comprehensive, simple, and understandable definition of threats. If we\ncan't agree on a definition how we can agree on solutions? And most\nfrightening: are hybrid threats always the first stage of asymmetric warfare\nor only an announcement of it? Can hybrid threats later develop or transform\ninto something different? Throughout this paper we examine the relationship of\nhybrid and asymmetrical threats. Considering the fluid nature of hybrid\nthreats and the need for asymmetric responses to ill-defined crises, is it\nmore useful to replace end-state with an understanding of the current-state as\ncontinuous, a condition of permanent crisis and global chaos? Have we entered\na state of conflict without conclusion?\n\nThe era of classic, rigid industrial warfare is over. War and peace are not\ndivided, they are the same side of the same coin. The binary approach that\nviewed war and peace as two sides of the same coin, war on one side, flip the\ncoin and \u2018voila\u2019, peace on the other is obsolete. The borders of war and peace\nare blurred, and we cannot think only in terms of \u2018battles\u2019. The Third\nMillennium military way of thinking and preparing no longer fits our needs. If\nthere is no war, classically defined, and the battlefield is a permanent\ncondition incorporating cooperation, competition, and conflict, there is\nnothing to \u2018win\u2019. Employing old intellectual paradigms, in this condition, we\nall lose.\n\nOur experience teaching civil and military crisis preparedness at university\nlevel and in professional military education settings, as well as working in\ncivil-military interaction environments, suggests military thinking has\natrophied. In the past, research for defense purposes invented and resulted in\nmany side products useable later in civilian, non-military contexts (microwave\nfor example), but today civilian companies are the most progressive and the\nmilitary is using more-and-more civilian products as a part of its military\ntool set (Internet, AI, laser and so on). Public, private partnerships are the\nway forward as civil and military merge to fill a military intellectual gap\nthat continues to widen.\n\nSome military thinkers and politicians seem to suggest all that is needed is\nto push a button and the military way of thinking and operating will be reset.\nWe do not think this is the case. If we fail to change our thinking and move\noutside of the intellectual constraints imposed by an overwhelming bureaucracy\nwhatever we reset will simply get us more of the same in a different order. It\nis better to think in a new way: we must recycle our way of thinking and\noperating even if the risk is that we do not know exactly what will come out.\nNeeded is at least the courage of Alice when she stepped into the Looking\nGlass.\n\nCrises with limited as well as global impacts and hybrid threats are daily,\nnormal conditions. Threats short of conventional war are redefining its\ncharacter. General Rupert Smith (2007) is unequivocal in his observation that\n\u201cwar no longer exists\u201d (3). Today, war is not consigned to clearly demarcated\nbattlefields where uniformed militaries engage in combat governed by agreed\nupon rules of war. Smith further notes conflict now occurs amongst the people\nwhere the \u201cdynamic of confrontation and conflict, rather than war and peace,\n(are) at the heart for war\u201d (183). The hybrid battlefield is everywhere.\n\nTraditionally war has been the province of the state as it held a monopoly on\nviolence (Clark, 2015: 4). States today have lost their monopoly and a result\nis that military leaders must now develop new responses for addressing crises,\nhybrid threats, and asymmetric warfare. First, however, military leaders ought\nto understand the changes. Military leaders appear anchored to a Clausewitzian\nunderstanding of war where political and military are distinct spheres. A\nWestphalian Model is regularly employed to analyze and explain asymmetric\nwarfare, a model that is proving to have limited utility as \u201cfewer and fewer\nwars involve conventional clashes of opposing armies\u201d (Levy & Thompson, 2010:\n13). Outdated analysis tools are used to try and understand ill-defined,\namorphous, virus-like hybrid, asymmetric threats. Military effectiveness has\nprimarily been determined on how conventional forces fared in interstate\nconflicts (Cleveland, et al, 2018). Victory defined in this manner is\nantiquated.\n\nSmith\u2019s new battlefield can be seen in the refugee crisis confronting the\nEuropean Union (EU). Beginning in 2015, massive numbers of refugees began to\nflow into the EU. The crisis has had the effect of disrupting the EU and some\nmember states of the NATO alliance contributing to an escalation of internal\ndisagreements to the point where some have begun to question the utility of\nthe EU and NATO. What bad actors could not achieve through kinetic action they\naccomplished though the weaponization of refugee populations metaphorically\nexpressed as biological weapons.\n\nRefugees present the military with a new challenge, one that cannot be dealt\nwith by kinetic means. The only available option is political. Refugees as\nhybrid threat have left the military on the sidelines primarily providing\npolicing activities. Political and military leaders have been slow to\nrecognize refugees as a hybrid threat. An overreliance on power as\ndeterminative can cause military leaders to struggle in attempting to\nunderstand the profound changes impacting responses to asymmetric, hybrid\nthreats where we have entered an era of war without conclusion (Naim, 2013:\n108). Military organizations\u2019 conservative and risk averse nature can lead\nthem to resist necessary changes (Clevealnd, et al, 2018).\n\nCivilian and military actors are obliged to develop a competency in\nrecognizing and understanding the hybrid threats that now characterize a\nboundless operational environment. The battlefield is no longer hemmed in by\ngeography. Technology has extended the physical fight into the cyber and space\nrealms. Human and technological networks dominate. Networks, not military\nformations, are the new organizing structure for hybrid conflict (Ferguson,\n2017). It is necessary to embrace this new paradigm; hybrid threats as network\nwar where there is no immediate announcement or recognition of a military\nattack, conflicts manifest themselves without any sign or warning. We\nrecognize hybrid threats as we are experiencing them.\n\nHybrid threats carry the potential to become asymmetric conflicts; they behave\nas living organisms that replicate themselves throughout an unbounded\nbattlefield demonstrating a fractal nature. Hybrid threat activities develop\ntheir own logic and move toward an internal congruence. The threat manifests\nitself at each level of the military structure \u2013 tactical, operational,\nstrategic, and political \u2013 differently, yet the same. To understand a hybrid\nthreat, it can be useful to think of broccoli. The smallest floret and the\nbunch replicate the same pattern at each level of analysis. A \u201cself-\nsimilarity\u201d develops (Gadlin, et al, 2013: 476). To combat hybrid threats, it\nis necessary to detect, analyze and systematically disrupt the self-\nreplicating pattern.\n\nUnconventional warfare is no longer only a shadow activity. State and non-\nstate actors conduct operations (cyber, media and fake news, classical\npropaganda, free-trading disruption, freedom of movement, small green-men,\nparamilitary organizations and many others) using hybrid means when power\nrelationships are unequal, and the consequences of force-on-force engagements\nare too great. The cost-benefit analysis has tipped to the unconventional.\n\nIt is not obvious, nor is it necessary, that hybrid threats will evolve into\nasymmetric warfare. As all adversaries are different the determining factor is\ntheir goals and competing agendas as well as human, technical, and economic\nresources.\n\nResilience speaks to a systems ability to recover from a shock; to quickly get\nback on its feet, so to speak. The military has a renewed interest in\nresilience as a key coping strategy (Jermalavi\u010dius & Parmak, 2018: 26).\nDiscussions around resilience should extend to include the need for fluidity.\nLate in the 20th century \u201cnimbleness and flexibility became increasingly\nvaluable\u201d (Na\u00edm, 2013: 117). Flexible suggests systems capable of bending\nunder stress and not breaking. Flexibility is only good enough in network war.\nNetworks must develop the capacity to flow with hybrid threats using their\nenergy to build network-wide responses. Fluid, non-kinetic conflict management\napproaches that \u201cembrace the chaos in a unity-of-aim, self-organizing, systems\napproach to peacebuilding\u201d are required (Maty\u00f3k & Stauder, 2020: 339).\n\nTo successfully transform crises and hybrid threats it is not necessary to\ndevelop asymmetrical warfare capacity nor even limited war responses, it is\nessential to build anti-fragile political and military networks as well as\ngeneral public warning systems. This approach moves beyond resilience.\nResilience relies on building systems that can absorb a shock and recover. In\ncontrast, Taleb (2014) outlines a need for development of anti-fragile systems\n\u2013 systems that embrace shocks and use the energy to make systems stronger.\nMilitary networks ought to become anti-fragile in meeting hybrid threats, and\ndevelop into dynamic, complex adaptive systems; \u201ca scale-free network\u2026a web\nwithout a spider\u201d (Ferguson, 2018: 37). To build resilient Whole-of-Society\nstructures is daily work and it needs to be done in advance of threats through\nJoint Civil-Military Interaction (JCMI) preparedness. During crises, systems\nare pushed to improvise, and improvisations do much better when they adhere to\nalready established algorithms of resilience.\n\nResilient, anti-fragile systems are the answer to crises, hybrid threats and\nasymmetric warfare. The question is: Are military networks capable of becoming\nanti-fragile without networking with non-military specialists? Most military\ndecisionmakers have shown little need to transform an Industrial Age military\nmindset to one that is adept to deal with a flattened and dynamic digital\nworld. Calls for change do not endanger the rigid, sturdy military system.\nChange can be viewed as an opportunity or a threat, and many military leaders\nhave learned to be risk averse.\n\nIt is important to recognize that crises and hybrid threats are nothing new.\nIt is a return to the future. Interstate industrial war is an outdated model\n(Smith, 14: 4-5). Business-like approaches to war are being replaced by\nconflict-entrepreneurs where violence is a hybrid cottage industry.\n\nConflict analysis and transformation, as part of Joint Civil-Military\nInteraction (JCMI) employing a unity-of-aim approach (Maty\u00f3k & Stauder, 2020)\nto achieve a harmony-of-effort, ought to become the primary non-kinetic\nresponse to hybrid threats. Presently, education and training schemes\nregarding Civil-Military Interaction (CMI) are inadequate leaving military\nactors ill-prepared to confront hybrid threats that have no kinetic response.\n\nThis is not to suggest that classic military capabilities are no longer\nneeded, only that our understanding of the military and requirements placed on\nmilitary actors have changed. The military is now one tool among many in\nconducting Whole-of-Society responses to crises, hybrid threats and asymmetric\nwarfare. For kinetic responses, the military remains the best option. The\nmilitary can establish a safe-and-secure environment within which humanitarian\naid and development actors can function. Special operations forces, fast\nmoving logistical support, medical support, and engineering are capacities\nthat civil society are unable to replicate. When it comes to kinetic and\ndisaster response the military maintains an unmatched economy-of-scale. But\nthe military is incapable of leading and implementing an entire comprehensive\napproach. We should not forget that more and more civilian companies are\ncontracted by the military. For instance, transportation of military assets is\nroutinely provided by civilian companies. The COVID-19 response is a painful\nacknowledgement that a new, fast reacting, well-coordinated complete body of\nactors at national and international levels is needed. Conflict resolution\nmethodologies have to become part of a JCMI tool kit. Negotiation, mediation,\nand facilitation are tools for combatting crises, hybrid, people-centric,\nnetwork battle and war (Maty\u00f3k & Schmitz, 2014). We should not underestimate\nthe influence of strategic communication and information timely delivered to\nthe general public involved in crises. Unfortunately, even though there is\nneed for new approaches to address emerging forms of conflict we remain ill\nprepared. For instance, \u201cNATO personnel are lacking awareness of CMI\u201d and they\nare unable to effectively engage non-military actors positively (van der West\n& Warstat, 2018: 46-47). A myopic focus on kinetic operations continues\nirrespective of the observation of how the military engages regularly with\nlocal civilian actors in non-kinetic engagements (Davidson, 2009; Gezari,\n2013). Increasingly, military actors find themselves involved in the political\nsphere 80 percent of the time and employing the remaining 20 percent of their\ntime in kinetic operations (Gezari, 2013).\n\nThe complex nature of crises and hybrid threats makes them a challenge to\nunderstand vis-\u00e0-vis conventional war. Possibly it is useful to borrow from\nthe medical community in working to understand hybrid, asymmetric warfare and\nthereby move out of the intellectual box that can restrict our thinking.\n\nCleveland, et al (2018) quotes Janis Berzin when discussing Information\nWarfare as an aspect of the asymmetric battle. For Berzin,\n\n> \u201cThe Russian view of modern warfare is based on the idea that the main\n> battlespace is in the mind, and as a result, new-generation wars are to be\n> dominated by information and psychological warfare with the main objective\n> being to reduce the necessity for deploying hard military power to the\n> minimum necessary, making the opponents military and civilian population\n> support the attacker to the detriment of their own government and country\u201d\n> (see: Learning to Distort: The Evolution of Information Warfare in Russia\u201d).\n\nPossibly it is useful to imagine the new battlespace as a social body where\ndiplomacy, information, security forces, and economics interact. Peacebuilders\napproach the social body as a physician approaches a patient; they conduct a\ndiagnosis, make a prognosis, and apply a therapy or intervention. Rather than\nmeeting asymmetric, hybrid threats with direct military force alone, CMI\nactors address violent conflict as a social virus using therapeutic means,\ntreating the patient holistically.\n\nThe current novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is a threat to global health and at\nthe same time is a teacher teaching us, that without a global scientific\napproach, research, and a unity of efforts no one wins. (At the moment we do\nnot have enough information regarding COVID-19 to see the whole picture. We\nare confronted with incomplete information and disinformation. We must wait\nand avoid speculations.) The novel corona virus and the more familiar yearly\nflu virus have no respect for national borders (just as hybrid threats and\nnetworks do not recognize borders); it is progressing in a fast-moving world\nadapting to its specific environment. Systems, states, societies and\nindividuals must adapt too, and they need to reinvent and develop a value\nregrettably forgotten in the last decades: solidarity. Solidarity is needed in\nminimizing the living space of a virus, the virus must have a host;\nunfortunately, selfishness is expanding to meet the pandemics size. In this\ninstance large portions of populations refuse to take COVID-19 seriously. The\nglobal community must be called to action, civil and military. There can be no\nhangers-on.\n\nThe paradigm \u2018war on terror\u2019 must be replaced with \u2018solidarity to everyone\u2019.\nCrises, limited or pandemic size, and hybrid threats that operate like, or as\nviruses, must be met with whole-of-society responses. Cultural, religious,\nethnic differences are minor when facing global, existential threats that\nendanger life and show no respect for social differences dividing individuals.\nThe smallest denominator is \u2018basic life\u2019 or \u2018human rights\u2019, if you prefer.\nHuman Security and National Security are two sides of the same coin.\n\nAsymmetric, hybrid threats infect the social body and when left untreated can\naffect the DNA of a society. Social structures become addicted to violence and\nconflicts become intractable. Violence becomes part of a society\u2019s DNA.\n\nHybrid threats can be understood as social viruses that live off their hosts\ngaining strength as host-bodies seek to develop an immunity. The hybrid threat\nas virus adapts to changes in the social body. It is a dynamic activity. The\nidea guiding civil-military intervention should be bringing the social body to\na state of wellness. The treatment plan should be holistic. It cannot be\nmilitary-centric. When a physician treats a patient, he or she treats the\nwhole patient; physical, emotional, and spiritual. Responses to asymmetric,\nhybrid threats cannot be no less focused. Societies have physical, emotional\n(cultural), and spiritual dimensions. A pathology in any one dimension impacts\nthe others.\n\nJoint Civil-Military Interaction (JCMI) could be the most progressive,\nadaptable, and useful tool available to civil authorities and the military in\ntackling hybrid threats and providing humanitarian assistance and disaster\nresponse to crises. Employing a CMI way of thinking civil and military actors\nharmonize their efforts in complex operational environments to ensure the\nmeeting of human needs and continuation of national security objectives,\nnational and human security merge. A CMI way of thinking is the goal where\ncivil and military act out of their expertise and complement each other.\nCompetition is anathema to CMI. Collaboration, cooperation, and\ncomplementarity (C3) are the process and the goal.\n\nTime is the most critical resource when executing humanitarian assistance and\ndisaster / crisis response operations. The CMI mindset is built upon a common\nlanguage or grammar. Agreeing to, and using, settled upon terms and\ndefinitions facilitates C3 and speeds joint problem-solving and joint\ndecision-making. Agreed upon conflict resolution processes expand the amount\nof time available to civil and military actors. Operational delays resulting\nfrom a misunderstanding of terms in use with no conflict resolution structure\nin place can result in unnecessary confusion among individuals and agencies.\n\nTo better manage the time available in complex operations planners and\noperators require new ways of thinking and acting. Bureaucratic, stovepipe\nresponses to fast-moving chaotic, complex, and complicated situations is no\nlonger acceptable. The Joint Civil-Military Interaction Network provides a\nstructure within which the CMI mindset is made manifest.\n\nThe JCMI Network brings civil and military actors as well as scholars together\nto investigate issues impacting civil-military interaction in peacekeeping and\nhumanitarian actions. JCMI is based on communication, planning, and\ncoordination among international, national, and local non-military\nrepresentatives and military leaders before, during, and post-crisis to\nfacilitate mutual effectiveness and efficiency of each. The purpose of JCMI is\nto construct a new way forward in addressing crises, hybrid threats and\nasymmetric warfare. Its goals are to:\n\n  * Establish and strengthen partnerships among JCMI actors,\n  * Build international cooperation,\n  * Inform and educate policymakers regarding JCMI, and \n  * Promote public policy initiatives that advance JCMI within peacekeeping and humanitarian response communities.\n\nThe JCMI Network offers a way forward. JCMI is a humanoid-algorithm, flexible\nenough to adapt as fast as possible in meeting new kinetic and non-kinetic\nthreats - conventional, hybrid, and asymmetric \u2013 providing real-time advice to\nmilitary and non-military actors regarding conflict analysis, resolution, and\ntransformation.\n\nAs a network, JCMI has the capacity to provide tailored responses based on\nneed. Off-the-shelf responses that are not context driven can have limited\nutility and are not part of the response-set; rather, subject matter experts\ncan \u2018swarm\u2019 to address specific needs in context. Strategy and tactics are\ndeveloped case-by-case. A response network is developed.\n\nIt may appear as though we are suggesting that addressing crises, hybrid\nthreats and asymmetric warfare is like coping with the spread of disease, and\nthat is correct. When confronting the spread of disease, it is important to\nmove fast, to bring experts together who are capable of collaborating, and\nfreely exchanging information in building capacity to respond. In a civil-\nmilitary interaction context, \u2018fight\u2019 is not exclusively used as a military\nterm. It describes concerted action in the same way we speak of \u2018fighting\nclimate change\u2019, \u2018fighting coronavirus\u2019, and \u2018fighting for peace\u2019.\n\nThe world is flat, and military organizations are vertical, hierarchical. The\nnon-military organizations are horizontal, more flexible. Conflict between two\nhorizons can lead to slow bureaucratic thinking and inadequate responses when\nquick action is needed. The military can default to what it knows best,\nkinetic responses. We must invent responses that are appropriate to the demand\nand comprehensive Joint Civil-Military Interaction is now the best option we\nhave to develop.\n\n**References**\n\nCleveland, Charles; Jensen, Benjamin; David, Arnel; & Brynat, Susan.

Under terms of the agreement, Kahuna will market and distribute\nIntermountain\u2019s competency management content within its proven SaaS platform\nand offer the combined solution to the healthcare market. The digital\ncompetency assurance platform will enable integrated healthcare systems to\ntrack and manage their workforce capabilities to meet enterprise staffing\nneeds.\n\n> Healthcare organizations are undergoing a massive move toward digitization\n> as they strive to operate more efficiently and more consistently relative to\n> the accepted standard of care. Processes from orientation to continuous\n> learning to staffing are all being examined. The conclusion for many is that\n> the current manual, paper-laden processes are not scalable or sustainable\n> and typically result in costly redundancies, siloed data, and general\n> frustration.\n\nHaving digitized their own clinical competency management processes,\nIntermountain Healthcare has realized operational efficiencies and has\nvalidated their clinical competency content with over 3.6 million competency\nassessments. These efforts have resulted in a significant ROI with over $13\nmillion in savings in the first six years, and an amazing record of zero Joint\nCommission audit findings with their digitized competency content.\n\n\u201cDigitizing our orientation processes has been a game-changer. We started 11\nyears ago and invested significant time and resources into standardizing our\nrole-based curricula and observational assessments into required behavioral\nexpectations. Defining the exact skills each role needed and providing the\ncontent in a digital platform has made the entire organization more\nefficient,\u201d said Tammy Richards, Intermountain\u2019s Assistant Vice President of\nProfessional Practice and Learning. \u201cThis solution helps our staff work at the\ntop of their license and gets them doing the work they\u2019re qualified to do as\nquickly as possible. Working with Kahuna, we now have the opportunity to take\nwhat we\u2019ve done to a whole new level and bring this solution to our peers\nacross the healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nThe Kahuna/Intermountain solution vastly improves these processes through the\ncombination of leading-edge technology and best-in-class competency content.\nThe combined Kahuna/Intermountain solution achieves the following:\n\n  * Efficiency \u2013 Elimination of redundancies in skill assessment and training hours through automated assignment and a \u201cbuilding block\u201d approach to career development. \n\n  * Transparency \u2013 \u201cSingle pane of glass,\u201d where learning, competencies, procedures, and experience all come together to form a complete picture of each individual as well as aggregation to a unit or an entire facility or system. \n\n  * Alignment to the Future \u2013 Historically, tracking caregiver competencies has largely been about risk avoidance (i.e. audit requirements). With this digital platform, competency assurance is optimized while also enabling strategic planning for future workforce needs, employee development, tactical staffing, and flexible enterprise staffing models. With the Kahuna/Intermountain solution, organizations will put in place a foundation for capturing and structuring this data that comes ready to support these downstream processes on Day 1. \n\nKahuna brings a best-of-breed competency management platform that has been\nbuilt to serve the needs of complex global competency assurance environments.\nKahuna\u2019s CEO, Jai Shah, said of the partnership, \u201cWe have worked very hard to\nbuild a skills platform that works for regulated environments and always knew\nwe could deliver significant value in healthcare. To enter the market with a\ngold standard organization such as Intermountain Healthcare as both a customer\nand a partner is just an amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nIntermountain provides validated competency and skills content that has been\ncurated to suit a number of various roles (nursing and non-nursing). This\ncontent library can fill the gap for systems needing assessment criteria\ndesigned by healthcare professionals and organized in a user-friendly format.\n\u201cOftentimes, the inertia in competency or skills initiatives is the lack of\nalignment on the actual content. Beyond being associated with a great brand\nlike Intermountain, the idea that we can offer such high-quality validated\ncontent to the healthcare market makes this partnership very exciting,\u201d added\nShah.\n\n\u201cOur market analysis confirmed that the competency management processes for\nclinical personnel are ripe for improvement across our industry. By partnering\nwith Kahuna, we are bringing something revolutionary to healthcare\ninstitutions by addressing very real and material inefficiencies,\u201d said Mike\nPhillips, M.D., Managing Director and Partner for Intermountain Ventures.\n\u201cWhile this partnership with Kahuna marks an important milestone for our\ninternal innovation program and for Ventures, more importantly, this solution\ncreates significant internal value while also laying a foundation for how\nother institutions can plan, develop, and deploy their clinical resources in\nthe future.\u201d\n\n**About Kahuna Workforce Solutions**\n\nKahuna Workforce Solutions is transforming competency management and workforce\nplanning.

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\nMany people ask common questions about a competency assessment, such as, \u201cWhat\nis a competency assessment?\u201d \u201cWhy do I need one?\u201d and \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d\n\n## A Competency Assessment Compares an Individual\u2019s Skills to Requirements\n\nA competency assessment is the assessment of someone\u2019s capabilities against\nthe requirements of their job. Those requirements are defined in a competency\nmodel. To be valuable, competency models should contain only tasks and skills\nthat are critical to success in the role, not every activity they perform in\ntheir job (which comes from a traditional job task analysis).\n\nThe assessment is performed on those identified tasks and skills for which a\nrating is selected based upon how they do that task, which defines their\nproficiency level. In other words, a competency assessment measures _how_\n(behaviors) someone does the _what_ (task or skill). The individual\u2019s selected\nproficiency level is then compared with the target level, defining proficiency\nor skill gaps for each task and skill.\n\nFor example, a manager assessment without a self-assessment will not provide\nthe results you seek since there will be no buy-in to the results. Start with\na self-assessment, add a manager assessment, and optionally add those from\nsubject matter experts.\n\n## Competency Assessments Quantify the Size of Your Skill Gaps\n\nMost organizations are blissfully unaware of the quantity and size of their\nskill gaps. They know they have them, but they don\u2019t know how large or\nwidespread they are, and they can\u2019t inform organizational plans, priorities,\nand strategy. Think about that for a moment. If you don\u2019t know what you can\nand can\u2019t do, how can you be successful? How can you truly define your\norganization\u2019s strengths, which opportunities you should pursue, or what you\nshould do about it?\n\nIf you are a senior leader and you don\u2019t have competency assessment data or\nskill gap analysis, you should be scared. You\u2019re making decisions that are\nbased on inadequate data. When it comes to understanding organizational\ncapability, you don\u2019t have to be in the dark. A competency assessment shows us\nthe light. And then the best decisions can be made, including where we need to\nupskill and reskill staff.\n\n## Competency Assessments Tell You What Action to Take\n\nIf you are in a learning, talent, or effectiveness role, you are capable of\neliminating this data void. Delivering competency assessments and using them\nto create a culture of learning such that upskilling and reskilling can happen\ncontinuously, should be part of your job description. Typically, that is\nensuring that people have the skills required to do their current and future\njobs. Without skills assessment data, you have no ability to mitigate skill\ngaps effectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce you know who does and doesn\u2019t have the required skills:  \n\n  * You can provide personalized learning to close those gaps.\n  * You can pair high performers of a specific skill with those who have that skill gap to close gaps quickly with task-based mentoring. (Read \u201c[The Value of Task-Based Mentors](https://www.td.org/insights/the-value-of-task-based-mentors).\u201d) \n  * Your talent acquisition strategy can be more focused so you hire those with the skills the organization lacks.\n\n## Competency Assessment Is Not \u201cOne and Done\u201d\n\nWhile some C-level executives think that you can do a competency assessment\nonce every few years, that\u2019s like saying you need only report company\nfinancials every five years. How could someone possibly want to invest? And in\nthis case, how can you invest well in your talent, your greatest asset?\n\nAccording to Rob Lauber, CLO at McDonald\u2019s, \u201cChange is happening so fast that\nby the time we upskill or reskill employees, some of those new skills are\nalready obsolete. We are looking at a future where millions of people will\nconstantly have to reinvent their skills.\u201d\n\nIf you want to \u201csay\u201d you\u2019ve done a competency assessment so you can check the\nbox, then just do one.\n\nBut if you want to actually drive capability in your organization, you must\ncreate the cycle of assessment, ongoing development, and reassessment _only_\non the tasks and skills you\u2019ve worked on so that you have a current picture of\ncapability at any time. Plus, you get the benefit of creating a culture of\nlifelong learning, driven by competency assessments, that drives real growth\nin your organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Additional Competency Assessment Uses: Career Development and Rapid\nOnboarding\n\nA competency assessment can also be used by individuals to assess their\nreadiness for other roles. People will no longer make assumptions about their\nreadiness for a role or guess at the requirements\u2014they will really know. They\ncan use the personalized learning recommendations as a career development plan\ntemplate to take specific action to plan for the role they desire. ( [More\nAbout Career Planning](https://www.td.org/insights/how-to-use-competency-\nmodels-for-career-planning))\n\nA competency assessment during the first few days of onboarding tells the new\nhire exactly what it looks like to be good and great in the job. No more\nfumbling. It shows them what action to take to close any gaps so they can own\ntheir development. Not only will it speed their time to proficiency, but it\nwill eliminate the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that leads to early exits\nwithin the first six months.\n\n## How to Get Started Assessing\n\nYou need at least two, but preferably three, elements for a competency\nassessment:  \n\n  1. a role-based competency model for those to assess\n  2. a competency assessment system to facilitate scale, privacy, and capability analytics\n  3. personalized learning to create individual reskill and upskill action plans.\n\nThe system is important because historically used tools, such as spreadsheets\nsent around, lack the privacy and control required globally (for example\nGDPR). And the volume of skills inventory data will be substantial. You need a\nsystem that will crunch it and create data visualizations you can use without\nmanual effort, or else you\u2019ll have lots of insightful data that is never used.\n\nWhile you could capture capability data with only the first two elements, you\ncan\u2019t affect skill gap closure. Knowledge without an action plan will get you\nonly so far.\n\nRecognize the self-awareness that comes when an individual realizes that they\ncan\u2019t do their job as well as they need to. They will buy into that there is\naction they need to take. If you provide personalized learning they can use to\ncreate and work an individual development plan or action plan, you have a\nchance to set each person on a path toward continuous learning.\n\n**[To learn more, join me at ATD 2020 International Conference&\nEXPO.](https://atdconference.td.org/)**  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [ATD Competency Model](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=ATD%20Competency%20Model)\n  * [Career Development Programs](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Career%20Development%20Programs)\n  * [Individual Development Plans](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Individual%20Development%20Plans)\n  * [My Career](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=My%20Career)\n  * [Skills Gap](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Skills%20Gap)\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n  * [Workforce Planning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Workforce%20Planning)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/CherylLasse-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Cheryl Lasse](https://www.td.org/user/about/CherylLasse-000001)\n\nCheryl Lasse is SkillDirector\u2019s managing partner.

While kindness has a part to play in our\neveryday lives, when we think about public policy (not just what the strategic\ndirection is, but how we implement it) where does kindness feature? Jessica\nSellick investigates._\n\n* * *\n\nBack in 1931 an American judge called **[Oliver Wendell\nHolmes](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr.)** described\nhow the interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal in\nreminding us how _\u201cthe machinery of Government would not work if it were not\nallowed a little play in its joints.\u201d_ People\u2019s views on public policy can\noscillate between \u2018harshness\u2019 with policy makers seen as treating people worse\nthan they deserve, or \u2018generosity\u2019 where policy makers are seen as treating\npeople better than they deserve. Nowhere are such debates more prevalent than\naround social welfare policy where issues such as \u2018need\u2019, \u2018entitlement\u2019, who\nis or should \u2018deserve\u2019 benefits or how the system should \u2018incentivise people\nto help themselves\u2019 are prevalent. This can lead to trade-offs being made in\nhow eligibility criteria is set and welfare support administered. In a rural\ncontext, debates persist over the funding formulas used to decide \u2018what\u2019 and\n\u2018how\u2019 public services are provided [are we distributing resources in a fair\nand equitable way for rural residents?] With ever-increasing demands being\nplaced on public services, amid fewer resources and the rising expectations of\nsome service users, can or should kindness help us navigate some of these\ndebates and issues?\n\n###### **What is kindness?**\n\nKindness is an elusive concept \u2013 we recognise it in our everyday lives and yet\nfind it difficult to define.\n\nThe term derives from the Middle English word \u2018kindenes\u2019 meaning \u2018noble deeds\u2019\nor \u2018courtesy\u2019. Its philosophy can be traced back to Aristotle and Book II of\n**[Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric_\\(Aristotle\\))** in which\nhe defines kindness as _\"helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return\nfor anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the\nperson helped.\u201d_ Nietzsche considered kindness to be \u2018curative herbs and\nagents.\u2019 In religion, Buddhists view kindness as the act of \u2018doing things for\nanother person, without substantial motivation\u2019. The Christian apostle Paul\nlists kindness as one of the nine traits considered to be the \" **[fruit of\nthe Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Spirit)** \". Judaism\nteaches that \u2018the world is built on kindness.\u2019 In literature, Mark Twain\nconsidered kindness as a _\u201clanguage which the deaf can hear and the blind can\nsee.\"_ While Charles Darwin\u2019s work on evolution might at first suggest\n**[survival of the fittest](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letters/darwins-\nlife-letters/darwin-letters1866-survival-fittest)** required selfishness, he\nactually believed humans to be social beings seeking good.\n\nIn academic circles, researchers have been carrying out studies into the\npsychology and biology of kindness. Psychologists at the University of Sussex,\nfor example, published a [study](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/46037)\nabout the \u2018warm glow\u2019 of kindness \u2013 with their findings based upon brain scans\nfrom some 1,000 people looking at what happens in the brain when they act out\nof genuine altruism and when there\u2019s nothing in it for them.\n\nA **[study](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_703807_en.html)**\nby the Universities of Exeter and Oxford found that taking part in self-\ncompassion exercises calms the heart rate and switches off the body's threat\nresponse. 135 Exeter students were divided into five groups, and members of\neach group heard a different set of audio instructions. The two groups whose\ninstructions encouraged them to be kind not only reported feeling more self-\ncompassion and connection with others, but also showed a bodily response\nconsistent with feelings of relaxation and safety.\n\nBack in 2015 geographer **[Danny Dorling](http://www.dannydorling.org/wp-\ncontent/files/dannydorling_publication_id5134.pdf)** drew upon multiple\nsources of evidence to try to understand the reasons why the UK had become one\nof the most unequal countries when ranked alongside 25 other countries. He\ndiscussed how behind every unequal policy there is a lack of empathy, and that\nonly kindness and respect will enable us to see each other as if we really are\n\u201call in this together\u201d.\n\nIn the United States last year UCLA established the **[Bedari Kindness\nInstitute](https://kindness.ucla.edu/)**. The Institute takes an\ninterdisciplinary approach to the study of kindness \u2013 looking at the\nevolutionary, psychological, economic, sociological, and other factors that\nfacilitate kind actions toward others. In developing its research programme\nthe Institute aims to translate its work into real-world practices and engage\nwith the public.\n\nIn everyday life kindness has come to the fore in the UK and around the world\nrecently - with acts of kindness and solidarity burgeoning amid Coronavirus\n(COVID-19): from a **[postcard](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-\ncornwall-51880695)** that you can drop off with neighbours who are self-\nisolating, offering your help with shopping or a friendly phone call; to\n**[supermarkets](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/help-information/customer-\nservice/coronavirus)** designating certain hours for vulnerable shoppers or\nNHS staff and frontline workers; the **[clap for our\ncarers](https://clapforourcarers.co.uk/)** , the 750,000\n**[volunteers](https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHS)** signing up to support the 1.5\nmillion people asked to shield themselves for three-months and the countless\nrainbows we see displayed in windows. Of course, much of it has also been\ngoing on behind the closed doors of hospitals and homes, anonymously and\nunsung.\n\n###### **Where does kindness fit in public policy?**\n\nBack in 2017 **[The Carnegie UK\nTrust](https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh53L1r-z6AIVV4fVCh07hQ_xEAAYASAAEgIbn_D_BwE)**\ninvited **[Julia Unwin](http://www.juliaunwin.com/)** to explore kindness in\npublic policy through holding a series of roundtables discussions, polling\n5,000 people, and speaking at events and writing. In her\n**[report](https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/news/julia-unwin-report-\nexamines-role-of-kindness-in-public-policy/)** , published in November 2018,\nUnwin argued that kindness, emotions and human relationships are a blind spot\nin public policy. She argued that kindness matters and makes a huge\ndifference: for without acts of kindness the \u2018state\u2019 and the \u2018market\u2019 would be\nincapable of functioning. Three drivers in public policy \u2013 (i) the\ntechnological power to manage information, (ii) the digital power to manage\ncommunication, and (iii) the economic force of austerity \u2013 have made it\nincreasingly important to look at the role of emotions, and kindness in public\npolicy. While policy makers are always engaging with emotional responses,\nfeelings and relationships; kindness itself tends not to feature in public\npolicy. Unwin\u2019s work on kindness suggests it matters for those developing,\nmanaging and accessing services: _\u201caction on kindness in communities must be\nmet by a new contract\u2026a contract that recognises that public services are\nalways about relationships and emotions. A contract that is written in the two\nlexicons of public service [rational and relational] and helps us all to be\nmore bilingual. A contract that will build trust in public services, encourage\nengagement and make social change possible\u201d._\n\nUnwin\u2019s work has stimulated further debate in this area. In September 2019\nSimon Anderson and Julie Brownlie from the University of Edinburgh queried if\nkindness was a concept belonging in, or having much to say to, the realm of\npublic policy \u2013 as part of discussions around how to enable and sustain what\nthey called an \u2018infrastructure of kindness\u2019. Their\n**[report](https://d1ssu070pg2v9i.cloudfront.net/pex/carnegie_uk_trust/2019/10/08105859/Public-\nPolicy-and-the-Infrastructure-of-Kindness-in-Scotland-Final-website-.pdf)**\nunpacks the conversations within policy and research circles in Scotland about\nhow and why kindness has emerged as a focus for policy. Anderson and Brownlie\ndescribe how the National Performance Framework (\n**[NPF](https://www.gov.scot/publications/launch-of-national-performance-\nframework-2018/)** ) has an _internal focus_ in creating the conditions in\nwhich acts and relationships of kindness can flourish within organisations;\nand an _external focus_ in creating the conditions in which acts and\nrelationships of kindness can flourish between individuals in community\nsettings. The NPF already signals a new approach being taken by civil servants\nand politicians \u2013 the national outcomes for **[children and young\npeople](https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/national-outcomes/children-and-\nyoung-people)** , for example, sets out a challenge to not only ensure that\nyoung people grow up with equal opportunities, but also that they \u2018feel loved,\nsafe, and respected\u2019.\n\nIn Wales, the **[Well-being of Future Generations\nAct](https://futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/)**\nrequires public bodies to consider the long-term impact of their decisions, to\nwork better with people, communities and each other, and to prevent persistent\nproblems such as poverty, health inequalities and climate change. The _**[art\nof the possible](https://futuregenerations.wales/the-art-of-the-possible/)**_\nprogramme is intended to make the Act \u2018real\u2019 by challenging \u2018business as\nusual\u2019 to create public services that meet the needs of current and future\ngenerations. A **[Healthier\nWales](https://futuregenerations.wales/a-healthier-wales/)** , for example,\ndescribes _\u2018a society in which people\u2019s physical and mental well-being is\nmaximised and in which choices and behaviours that benefit future health are\nunderstood\u2019_ \u2013 it further describes a need to _\u2018support people to act with\ncompassion.\u2019_\n\nOutside the UK, in a\n**[speech](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1021182)** at the United\nNations General Assembly in September 2018 New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister\nJacinda Ardern called for kindness and collectivism as an alternative to\nisolationism, protectionism and racism. Since then the New Zealand Government\nhas implemented a **[family tax\npackage](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-12/Families%20Package%20Factsheet.pdf)**\naimed at reducing the number of children living in poverty by 41% by 2021 and\nintroduced a **[Child Poverty Reduction\nAct](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2018/0057/18.0/LMS8294.html)**\nwhich contains further child poverty reduction measures. In his 2018\n**[Christmas message](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/read-prime-minister-\njustin-trudeau-s-christmas-message-1.4230076)** the Canadian Prime Minister\nJustin Trudeau talked about _\u201cspreading kindness and light to each other\u201d_.\n\nBack in the UK, on the 31 March 2020 the think tank Compass held an **[online\nevent](https://www.compassonline.org.uk/events/the-ethics-and-emotions-of-the-\ncoronavirus-emergency/)** on \u2018the ethics and emotions of the Coronavirus\nemergency.\u2019 This looked at how the pandemic is forcing us to think and behave\ndifferently: how do we relate to each other socially and politically now? What\nare the right emotions and tone to adopt?\n\nMany of these policy research discussions and dialogues have emerged as a\nresult of seeing limits to the welfare state (be it a crisis in health care or\nchild poverty); or global issues such as COVID-19, climate change or\nmigration; and/or in response to populist political leaders. All of this is\nleading to reflections on if and where kindness, empathy and compassion fit\ninto public policy.\n\n###### **Where does kindness fit into policy interventions?**\n\nThe civil service **[competency\nframework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-\ncompetency-framework)** sets out 10 competencies grouped into three areas\n(setting direction, engaging people, and achieving results) to indicate how\ncivil servants are expected to work. From a HR perspective the framework is\nintended to be used for recruitment, performance management and staff\ndevelopment discussions and progression. Similarly, the **[capabilities\nplan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-capabilities-\nplan)** for the civil service identified four priority areas for future\ndevelopment: (i) leading and managing change, (ii) commercial skills and\nbehaviour, (iii) delivering successful projects and programmes, and (iv)\nredesigning services and delivering them digitally. Holders of public office\nshould act in accordance with the **[7\nprincipals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-\npublic-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2)** of public life:\nselflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and\nleadership. While it is important that civil servants adhere to these\nframeworks and codes, does kindness require a behavioural shift that is not\nexplicit in these existing documents? A shift that would lead towards more\n_open and collaborative working_ \u2013 including a long term commitment from\nnational and local policy and decision makers to understand, support, reflect\nand invest in organisations and communities?\n\nKindness could bring civil servants _closer to communities_ \u2013 by being\naccessible and listening to what people are saying, including the voices of\npeople who are not traditionally heard.\n**[Research](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Policy%20making%20in%20the%20real%20world.pdf)**\nhas looked at repeated efforts to rationalise policy through processes,\nqualities, structures and politics. This can lead policy to be seen as\nresponding to problems rather than identifying issues before they become\nproblems in need of intervention. In business, for example, there is often a\nquality control process whereby any new products are trialled and stress-\ntested before they reach the marketplace. Policy makers can find it difficult\nto adapt to local and changing circumstances (i.e., they often focus on making\nthings happen systematically). We also need a greater awareness of, and be\nable to measure, the intended and unintended effects of the implementation of\npolicy (i.e., will the intervention\n**[disadvantage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-proofing)**\nsome rural communities?).\n\nKindness could open up a new dialogue about where, how and why policy makers\nshould _**invest**_. At a macro level some of us spend time looking at the\nproduction, distribution, consumption and trade of goods and services and yet\nless time understanding the role rural residents and community organisations\nplay in reducing isolation, loneliness and demand on acute health services and\nsocial care. Can we _measure what we value_ \u2013 such as the value of\nbefriending, improved mental health or savings from joint working? The\nScottish Household Survey (\n**[SHS](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-household-survey-key-\nfindings-2018/)** ), for example, contains questions asking respondents about\npeople who are kind and trusted in their neighbourhoods; other public bodies\nare using **[social value tools](https://socialvalueengine.com/)** to measure\nthe wider benefits and outcomes of their interventions.\n\nUnderstandably, some commentators query if kindness should inform policy and\ndecision making at all. They cite the need to ensure _fairness, openness,\nclarity and transparency_. **[Steven\nPinker](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/steven-pinker)** , a\npsychologist at Harvard University, describes our natural tendency to\nempathise more with our friends and relatives than with strangers \u2013 and he\nsuggests that no amount of training can erase this difference. Similarly, we\ncan focus on the \u2018warm glow\u2019 we get from being kind rather than thinking\nthrough whether it will deliver positive results (i.e., what are the upstream\nand downstream consequences? Does being kind lead us to focus on \u2018us feeling\ngood\u2019 rather than implementing initiatives that actually \u2018make people\u2019s lives\nbetter?\u2019?) Some commentators question how kindness fits into evidence based\npolicy ( **[EBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy)** ) in\nwanting to apply scientific standards of proof?\n\nNowhere is this discussion more illuminated than in health. NHS England\u2019s\n**[Evidence Based Intervention Programme](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/ebi-statutory-guidance-v2.pdf)** examined how to avoid\nvariations in clinical interventions. And yet in \u2018the **[Language of\nKindness,\u2019](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Language-Kindness-Nurses-\nStory/dp/1784741973)** former nurse Christie Watson explains how when she\nstarted her career some 20-years ago she thought of nursing as a combination\nof chemistry, biology, physics, pharmacology and anatomy, but gradually\nrealised it to be much more about philosophy, psychology, art, ethics and\npolitics. Similarly, the **[mum\ntest](https://www.cqc.org.uk/news/releases/making-mum-test-real-cqc-sets-out-\nits-new-model-inspecting-adult-social-care)** developed by the Care Quality\nCommission (CQC) seeks to personalise the inspection regime \u2013 by asking if the\nservice is \u2018caring\u2019 the CQC explores whether staff \u2018involve and treat everyone\nwith compassion, kindness, dignity and respect.\u2019 Here the balance between\nscientific\u2013technical and psychosocial elements of patient care [a\n**[biomedical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_model)** of\nmedicine] and the humanisation of medical care [having empathy, compassion and\nbeing kind and sympathetic] come to the fore. In the United States, for\nexample, physician-scientists Stephen Trzeciak and Anthony Mazzarelli have\nhighlighted what they refer to as the systemic inhumanity within \u201cpatient-\nbased\u201d medicine. Referring to a **[\u201ccompassion\ncrisis\u201d](https://www.compassionomics.com/)** in US health care; they argue\nthat treating patients more kindly would improve health outcomes, reduce\ndoctor burnout and reduce costs.\n\n###### **What makes a (rural) community kinder?**\n\nThe Carnegie UK Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation have compiled\n**[evidence](https://d1ssu070pg2v9i.cloudfront.net/pex/carnegie_uk_trust/2017/07/LOW-\nRES-3110-Kindness-Overcoming-Risk-Report.pdf)** and undertaken action research\nwith communities on kindness. They view kindness as important in both reducing\nsocial isolation, tackling loneliness and improving wellbeing; and in\nproviding the building blocks for community empowerment through positive\nrelationships and values. They have highlighted three factors that contribute\nto kinder communities: (1) _welcoming places_ \u2013 by this they mean places that\nare free to use, have warm hospitality and are free from any agendas. (2)\n_Informal opportunities_ \u2013 creating opportunities to connect and act in\nkindness. (3) _Values of kindness_ \u2013 being kind to you, trusting people and\ncelebrating kindness. Linked to these themes they suggest three actions lead\nto kinder communities: (i) _thinking and talking about kindness to encourage\nus all to be kinder_ , (ii) leaders _empowering people to act in kindness_\n(particularly leaders of organisations that provide services), and (iii)\nGovernment _removing barriers to kindness_.\n\nIn July 2019 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG)\nset out its\n**[vision](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/819477/MHCLG_Communities_Framework_Accessible.pdf)**\nfor **[stronger local\ncommunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/brokenshire-unveils-new-plan-\nfor-building-stronger-communities)** \u2013 what they look like and what Government\nand local partners can do to support them. The vision focuses on four areas:\n(i) trust, connectedness and local pride; (ii) active citizenship and local\ncontrol; (iii) shared community spaces; and (iv) shared prosperity. Building\non activity taking place across departments, Government intends to hold\nconversations with communities across the country, establish Civic Deal pilots\nand publish a Communities White Paper. According to MHCLG stronger communities\nare built on _people, place and pride_ and lead to improvements in health and\nwellbeing, local services, economic growth, decision making and the\nenvironment. The vision cites the **[Ennerdale\nHub](https://thegatherennerdale.com/)** in Cumbria as an example of a strong\ncommunity. Here residents came together to form a cooperative to develop and\nrun \u2018The Gather\u2019, a community centre, shop, caf\u00e9, exhibition and event space\nin the heart of the village. The Hub developed this facility for the local\ncommunity in response to the reduction and withdrawal of services in the area.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015 the **[RSA](https://www.thersa.org/)** worked with the\nUniversity of Central Lancashire and London School of Economics to carry out\n**[research](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-\nservices-and-communities-folder/connected-communities-social-inclusion-and-\nmental-wellbeing)** in seven neighbourhoods across England on **[connected\ncommunities](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-\nservices-and-communities-folder/connected-communities-social-inclusion-and-\nmental-wellbeing/about)**. This longitudinal project focused on how\ncommunities can support themselves [where people are embedded within networks\nof social support in which people experience reduced social isolation and\ngreater wellbeing] in ways that reduce pressure on public services. They\nargued that by investing in interventions that build and strengthen networks\n**[4 types of divided](https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-\narticles/reports/community-capital-the-value-of-connected-communities)** will\nbe shared by people in the community: a wellbeing dividend, a citizenship\ndividend, a capacity dividend and an economic dividend.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a non-profit organisation, national charity or Government\ndepartment, what does all of this work mean for rural communities? I offer\nthree points.\n\n  1. _People:_ rural residents do things intuitively every day for others in their local community that are either taken for granted or that we rarely take the time to reflect upon (e.g. dropping a prescription off, providing a lift to get somewhere or checking in on a vulnerable resident). Existing work on kindness, connectedness and strength tends to focus upon individuals or community organisations (looking upwards or downwards) rather than at a whole community level (within). Who is doing what, when and why \u2013 and how might we encourage more people [living in rural and urban areas] to adapt some of these practices?\n  2. _Place:_ RSN readers are well-rehearsed in the innovative ways that rural communities seek to overcome access to services difficulties \u2013 we are used to getting by with less in rural areas compared to our urban counterparts. In being kind to each other in rural communities do we reduce demand on public services? (E.g. we may notice when a vulnerable person we visit is deteriorating and support them to access help sooner so they do not present in crisis; we pick up the prescription to help a neighbour get and stay well). This opens up an important dialogue about ensuring policy makers do not leave rural communities to \u2018get on with it\u2019 [i.e., where services might be reduced or withdrawn] or that they seek to absorb what we do into their system with its strategies and processes. We need the relationship between rural communities and policy makers to be \u2018bilingual\u2019, can kindness build and strengthen links between rural communities and policymakers? \n  3. _Outcomes:_ there are clearly societal benefits that come from acts of kindness (e.g. reduction in isolation and loneliness, improved health and wellbeing etc.) but we often find it difficult to identify, describe, quantify and measure these. In many instances we have not collated data or used it as part of an evidence base to make the case for investing in rural communities. \n\nFor me kindness is not grand, rather it is found in small everyday acts,\nsomething that you do for another unselfishly but from which your personal\ngain can also be unavoidable. While talking about kindness in a professional\ncontext has not always sat comfortably with many of us, amid COVID-19 it has\nbrought it to the fore and for many of us offered warmth and support at a time\nof great need. How can we ensure the kindness displayed amid this tragic\nglobal pandemic continues and informs whatever our \u2018new normal\u2019 ways of\nworking will be? How can we continue to talk about kindness in our work, in\nour lives and in our rural communities?\n\n![](/images/RoseSmall.png)_Jessica is a researcher/project manager at Rose\nRegeneration.

[Nate\nDvorak](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=167717)\n\n![Rethinking Competencies, Part 3: Is Your Program\nBroken?](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/mokwasrvweolp5sjikqvjw.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * The dream of competencies is laudable, but results are scarce\n  * Simple programs beat complex ones; developmental beats evaluative\n  * Effective competency programs identify emerging leaders\n\n_This article is the third in a series about rethinking competency behaviors,\nfeedback and programs._\n\nLeadership and management competencies are part of the organizational DNA of\nmodern business. Since the 1970s, competencies have offered the guiding\nprinciples of managerial excellence. Competencies were designed as a\nfoundation for people leader development, a means to generate value, a\nprecursor of organic growth, a guide to engineering consistent cultures -- and\neven as a part of compensation programs.\n\nIf only.\n\nSince their well-intended introduction, competencies have taken on a life of\ntheir own. Rather than serving as a set of must-have skills, many competency\nprograms have become a list of contradictory demands and subjective rationales\nthat can be used to justify almost anything.\n\nConfusing, demoralizing and only occasionally linked to employee development\nand organic growth, most leadership competency models have not created the\norganizational value that they were meant to.\n\nAnd because every leadership role demands its own competencies, each role --\nor sometimes, each leader -- requires a unique format. Running many different\ncompetency assessments for many different people with the input of many, many\n_other_ people takes a great deal of HR's time and energy, introduces rater\nbias, may expose companies to privacy issues, and may not identify the\nqualities proven to improve leadership performance.\n\nIt may also ruin your leadership pipeline.\n\n### **Examine Your Competencies Critically**\n\nGallup research shows that [91% of people who have recently changed\nroles](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/245480/why-need-compete-employees-\ncustomers.aspx) left their former company to do so, that the most talented are\nthe [likeliest to leave](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231641/talent-walks-\nwhy-best-employees-leaving.aspx), and that 87% of millennials and 69% of older\ngenerations say \"professional or career growth and development opportunities\"\nare [chief concerns in a\njob](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-\nopportunities.aspx).\n\nA competency model has to promote growth or it wastes HR's time and leaders'\npatience. But if the program is so confusing that it fails to attract and keep\ntalented people, it's creating a leadership vacuum for the future. So if your\nleaders raise their eyebrows at your company's must-have competencies, or your\nmust-haves don't seem to measurably affect their performance, it's time to\nrethink the model. Before you start, ask yourself these questions:\n\n  1. **Is your competency program too complicated?** Too many competencies on the list, too many competency models being used at the same time, too many measures and too many raters baffle leaders and managers about who is rating whom, on what, for what purpose -- and HR leaders can get lost in the weeds too. As a result, that overcomplicated program just confuses people and won't improve performance much.\n\n  2. **Does your program focus more on evaluation than development?** If most of your investment is spent on the upfront administration and reporting, and not on using the results for coaching, learning, growth and development, the focus is misplaced. An effective competency model [clearly connects results to learning and growth](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267020/rethinking-competencies-part-feedback.aspx).\n\n  3. **Is your 360 used for rankings?** 360s are often used to rate or rank. That's not what 360s are for. That is what goals and performance management systems are for. The most effective use of multi-rater feedback is developmental, so if a 360 is used to evaluate performance rather than guide growth, it may miss the mark.\n\n  4. **Is your competency assessment dismissed as \"just a year-end thing\"?** Leadership competency acquisition must be measured at some point in time, of course, but if the assessment seems like a chore and the results aren't put to effective use (i.e., ongoing conversations with clearly defined goals and outcomes) the whole process can feel like a check-the-box exercise.\n\n### **The Right Model: Simple, Strengths-Oriented and Development-Focused**\n\nToo many \"yes\" answers to the questions above indicate that it's time to build\na new model. Gallup recommends basing it on the findings from a recent study\nof more than 550 job roles and 360 unique job competencies, which shows that\nnearly all competencies fall into seven dimensions ([everything from building\nrelationships to creating\naccountability](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267017/rethinking-\ncompetencies-part-expectations-leaders.aspx)).\n\nUse those seven dimensions to develop _one_ model, and introduce variations\nwhen a role is quantifiably unique. One model is easier to create, administer,\ncommunicate and use in subsequent development.\n\nThat said, any model should reflect achievable, future-oriented performance\ngoals. And it should focus on what the leader is most capable of and what\nthey're naturally great at, rather than weaknesses the leader must fix.\nPredicating a review on strengths helps HR align learning and growth\nopportunities with the review _and_ the individual's areas of greatest\npotential.\n\nBut that's not enough. The program should communicate all coaching resources,\nindividual self-paced learning, cohort or classroom learning, and experiential\nopportunities that allow people to use the feedback as a starting point for\ndevelopment, not a summary or evaluation.\n\nA more simplified, strengths-oriented, development-focused performance review\ncomes a lot closer to the original vision for leadership competencies. And\nit's far likelier to achieve the outcomes that companies want -- the outcomes\nthey hire leaders to accomplish -- while increasing the capacities of the\nleaders they have.\n\nSo if your current competency program is at all contradictory, overly\ncomplicated or demoralizing, it is not doing what you need it to do. It should\nfill your leadership pipeline with emerging leaders who are learning and\ngrowing in their role. It should have a measurable positive outcome on\nperformance. It should create organic growth.\n\nIf it doesn't do those things, why bother with it at all?\n\n### **Most performance development programs simply don 't work. Build one that\ndoes.**\n\n  * Want to learn more about competencies?

A robust performance management system plays an important\nrole in helping companies determine the efficacy of their workforce while\nensuring employees have a clear idea of the important parameters of\nassessment. With such an important role, it's of little wonder that 2019 has\nwitnessed many companies experiment with the right way to undertake\nperformance management and technology has had a central role in play in many\nof such changes.\n\nFor companies, getting performance management right has become imperative.\nWith external market conditions becoming more competitive and technology\ndisrupting much of how business once used to happen, having the right\nperformance management system in place means having a clear idea where and how\nto make employees more productive. It also helps companies address\ninefficiencies in their workforce and develop the people with the right fit\nand skills even further.\n\nWith this intent in mind, it comes as little surprise how the relevancy of\nupdating the performance management system has become an important HR\npriority. A Gartner report notes that a vast majority of HR leaders (84%) are\nworking to fix their performance management systems. Also, to making the\nprocess more impactful, factors like perception of performance management as\nbureaucratic, costly and of the low-value processes make it important for HR\nprofessionals to revamp performance management to make it more robust.\n\nThe year saw a shift of many companies moving away from traditional, often\nannual ways of addressing performance issues and taking up a rather dynamic\napproach. The best companies are shifting away from rigid systems toward a\nmore flexible approach that reinforces the critical behaviors that matter\nevery day and aligned individual work with organizational goals. Effective\nperformance management includes providing meaningful, real-time feedback;\nensuring that employees have clear expectations; and coaching employees to\nachieve their maximum performance levels. The following aspects of performance\nmanagement took center stage this year\n\n### Compensation models\n\nToday these is a need to measure performance more accurately. Employees,\nespecially in companies that operate in highly disruptive industries like tech\nand finance, often work through different projects and cross-functional teams/\nPerformance management as a result too has become more holistic. 360-degree\nreview, for example, is slowly becoming accepted as a form of performance\nreview and helps make the entire process more adaptive.\n\n### Employee experience and development\n\nEmployee experience has become an important factor to influence performance\nmanagement systems. Much like how other aspects of modern-day HR take employee\nexperience into account, performance management systems have begun doing the\nsame. Today employee experience refers to the culture that the employees are a\npart of through their entire interaction with the company. The process has\nbeen made to feel less transactional and cumbersome for employees and helps in\nenabling employees to improve their overall performance. Managers too are\nbeing trained on having performance-based discussions that help address gaps\nand make employees more productive.\n\n### Role of technology\n\nThe growing role of HR tech has enabled performance management to be more\ndata-driven and take into account a larger set of data to remove bias. The\ndigital technologies within performance management have made it more real-time\nand impactful in driving productivity. But with such a rise, there also is the\nneed to build the right ways to leverage tech. With the application of AI and\nautomation increasing, HR professionals will aim to create more robust and\nmeaningful performance reviews, in the coming years.\n\n### Succession planning and training gaps\n\nPerformance management systems have been tuned to create ways of assessing\ncompetency gaps and developing talent. HR professionals can leverage such\nsystems to identify high performing talent and plan leadership succession with\ngreater accuracy. By building systems that are continuous and involve a\n360-degree performance review, HR professionals can contribute more\nstrategically to businesses and channelize efforts to retain key talent.\n\nThe bedrock many such changes in performance management in recent years has\nbeen in the case of improving the effectiveness of such systems in the first\nplace. Usually being a cumbersome process and one that many dreaded, the aim\nof performance management to make an employee more productive has been an\nimportant force of change this year. This shift is important as many companies\nhave begun extending this concept to undertake performance management more\ncontinuously. In an attempt to make change performance management from a\nperiodic, transactional, and often tick in the box activity, HR professionals\nare actively trying to use it to add more value to employee work.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management

forwarding associations, the Ghana Institute of\nFreight Forwarders, (GIFF) and the Association of Customs House Agents of\nGhana, (ACHAG) have expressed the need for adequate preparations before\ngovernment introduces a new vendor to take over from all existing vendors\noperating at the Ports and borders as part of the new customs management\nreforms as Ghana Community Network Services (GCNet) threatens to go to court\nif government wrongly terminates its contract.  \n  \n\u201cI think government needs to go back and reintroduce it in a better format\nthan what they are doing now. There are a lot of things they need to do to let\nus have confidence that this new system coming up is far better than what is\nexisting now. There is lack of confidence in the system and that is why people\nare not too comfortable with it,\u201d Yaw Kyei, President of ACHAG suggested.  \n  \n\u201cIt goes both ways. Assuming we decide to pull the plugs on the system while\nwe have a contract, government will take us to court. So if government is\ndoing the same and pulling the plug and not letting the company\u2019s contract\ncome to an end, clearly we would have to go through certain motions,\u201d Carl\nSackey, GCNet, said.  \n  \nThis concern was raised on the live Eye on Port panel discussion, when some\nvendors and users of customs clearance processes expressed their positions on\nthe incoming government\u2019s new customs management reforms that is supposed to\nbe driven by the UNIPASS technology operated by Ghana Link.  \n  \n**Is UNIPASS Ready?**  \n  \nEdward Akrong, President of the Ghana Institute of Freight Forwarders, claimed\nthe UNIPASS is not as functional as it is being touted by the Government, and\nthe pilot program in some low-stress areas, is not yielding much results.  \n  \n\u201cAs we speak, go to the stations where the senior minister ordered the roll\nover, what is happening there? They are still using the GCNet and PAARS by\nWest Blue system. So far, I have seen one declaration from Aflao,\u201d he\nrevealed.  \n  \nThis according to him, made him wonder if the UNIPASS is at full strength to\ntake over from the existing vendors, at stress areas especially in Tema which\nhas not been fully tested with the system.  \n  \n\u201cThis is all not plug and play like it looks. Just get set ready to go! Once\nwe plug, we don\u2019t want to have any issues. When the frustration starts, and\nyou cannot clear on time, and the clients are coming at you, and shipping\nlines are taking their demurrages because of delays\u2026that is where the\nfrustration starts,\u201d he explained.  \n  \n**Port Efficiency**  \n  \nThe President of GIFF asked why the case of the multiplicity of vendors and\ninadequate interoperability of systems is being publicised profoundly by the\nGovernment, as upon experience, West Blue and GCNet have been able to provide\na seamless port clearance system.  \n  \n\u201cWe do not feel at the back end, how the transactions go through because it is\nseamless,\u201d he opined.  \n  \nOn his part, the President of ACHAG, Yaw Kyei, revealed that his outfit is\nexcited that a single vendor is to be deployed to kick out the ineffective\nCargo Tracking Notes as well as other vendors which had been a mistake from\nits inception.  \n  \n\u201cCompliance is coming off the system, CTN is coming off, and CCVR is even off\nthe system, and you can put in the BOE way ahead of time, and you can correct\nany issues before the vessel arrives. So, we are excited about that,\u201d he\naffirmed.  \n  \nHe added that his outfit is open to new customs management reforms once it\nwould contribute to port efficiency and ease of doing business with efficient\nend-to-end customs management system.  \n  \nThe President of ACHAG however stated that GCNet as an existing vendor may\nhave equally been considered to lead the new customs management reforms since\nthey have demonstrated competency over a long period of time.  \n  \n\u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes we are also a bit more hysterical not knowing who is\ncoming in. Whoever comes in and is able to offer services we are okay. I must\nsay GCNet for example we have never had problems with them. They have offered\nservices that we have very little to worry about. Assuming whoever comes in is\nthe same or better than GCNet, why not,\u201d he indicated.  \n  \n**Inadequate training**  \n  \nHe said he was unhappy about the initial training arrangements that was being\nimplemented by the team from UNIPASS but the situation has improved.  \n  \n\u201cThe start of the UNIPASS program had not been too good, but efforts have\nreally been made, such as training programs.\u201d  \n  \nEddy Akrong however was of the opinion that UNIPASS hasn\u2019t prepared users well\nenough ahead of their takeover of customs management systems.  \n  \n\u201cOne thing we also stress is that, the customs regimes are not just one. You\ndon\u2019t just do imports. You\u2019re doing transit, exports, temporary importation,\netc. If you do not go through all these processes to identify the issues\ntherein, then we are going to have problems when we really start,\u201d he\nexpressed.  \n  \n**Handover systems**  \n  \nThe Deputy General Manager, Technical, of the Ghana Community Network\nServices, Carl Sackeyrevealed that government via a letter by the Senior\nMinister has asked GCNet to handover its data and systems for review and\neventual replacement with a new system to takeover customs management in\nGhana, but a timeline was not set for that.  \n  \nHe explained that so far as they still have a contract with Government till\n2023, they will continue to execute their mandate for which they were\ncontracted.  \n  \n\u201cThey haven\u2019t given us an ultimatum that indicates a date to handover. There\nis nothing of the sort. We are still saying that, we want to execute the\ncontract as specified which ends December 2023.\u201d  \n  \nHe said GCNet are happy with providing the state with the sovereign data of\nthe country but cannot handover the other elements of the government demands,\nas they constitute intellectual property and giving them out to a competitor\nwould be inappropriate and illegal.  \n  \n\u201cCUPIA is the one providing the software which is the same thing GCNet is\ndoing for Ghana. To want GCNet to handover stuff that constitutes intellectual\nproperty to a competitor, that doesn\u2019t add up!\u201d  \n  \nGCNet refuted the idea that it did not fulfil targets set for them and\ncontributed to inefficiencies in the system.  \n  \nGCNet also said it did not have a problem of interoperability with other\nvendors.  \n  \n\u201cIt is technically GCNet and West Blue which are the two players in the port\ninterfacing. I do not remember the last time we had a meeting or email to that\neffect, because the systems are working,\u201d he stated.  \n  \n**GCNet to see out contract or go to court**  \n  \nCarl Sackey denied the notion that they are holding the country to ransom, and\nemphasized that GCNet are only focused on executing its contract, hence any\nimpediment will be subjected to legal proceedings to bring about justice.  \n  \n\u201cFor us to accept anything, we would have to go to court. Because if\ngovernment doesn\u2019t see reason, we would go to court,\u201d he emphasized.  \n  \nHe stated that GCNet would continue to ensure that they have their systems up\nand running and are resolved to secure government revenue and ensure trade\nfacilitation under the current conditions.  \n  \n\u201cIt is important that we note that as an entity that is interested in making\nGhana work, whether government takes a decision to do parallel or not, we\nwould have to continue to operate, because it serves nobody\u2019s interest if the\nfreight forwarders and importers suffer undue demurrage because of these\ncontractual issues,\u201d he assured.\n\nSend your news stories to ** ** and via WhatsApp on **+233 55 2699 625.**\n\n### Join our Newsletter\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\n[ Brought to you by ](http://get.degreed.com/business)\n\nBy now, most of us have caught on to the idea that talking about skills is\ncool, and many companies are simply replacing the word learning with skills.\nWhile this idea is taking over the L&D world, many professionals are facing\nchallenges in reconciling this idea with their companies\u2019 pre-existing\ncompetency models.\n\nThe problem with competency maps is they evolve so quickly and they\u2019re often\noutdated before being approved and published. And who really knows how to\nmeasure the broad statements they often contain, such as, \u201c . . . Treats\ncustomers with empathy and kindness while expediently resolving their issues?\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s why organizations also have committees to calibrate the resulting\ncompetency measurement processes.\n\nSo we understand the complexity around competency models, but what\u2019s the\nalternative? Our solution: mapping skills to roles to quantify ability and\ncreate visibility. Once you\u2019ve mapped, you measure, modify, and share what\nyou\u2019re learning with the data. We can help with these five steps.  \n\n##  **1\\. Start With Why**\n\nThis is the fundamental business reason why you\u2019re measuring skills. For most\norganizations, the main driver is growth, whether that is in size, in new\nmarkets, or in new products and services to future-proof your organization.\n\nDon\u2019t stop there, though. Remember that you must get this data from people.\nAnd to get the most accurate data, it\u2019s best to avoid highly pressurized\nmoments, like promotions or raises. Another best practice is to identify a\n\u201cwhy\u201d for each individual, which is often a version of career progression,\nespecially if it occurs within the organization (think internal mobility).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **2\\. Focus on a Few Roles to Start**\n\nRemember that one of the reasons competency models don\u2019t work is their\ncomplexity. They\u2019re layered and wordy, so let\u2019s not repeat that mistake. When\ncrafting your solution, focus on a few critical roles to start. Maybe you\nstart with growth roles or high-performing departments\u2014even a horizontal role,\nlike a manager or business analyst. Or perhaps you focus on important skills\nfor new hires, like going back to the basics.\n\n##  **3\\. Map Skills to Roles**\n\nAfter selecting a handful of crucial roles, it\u2019s time to map skills to them.\nSounds easy, right? It can be but there are a few common challenges:  \n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * **Too Many:** Recall where we went off the road with competencies and avoid doing too much. This makes it challenging to hit the goal identified in step one. In other words, it will make it difficult to glean immediate insights.\n\n  * **Non-Critical:** The reality is that every one of us is a complex system of skills. Some of these skills help us to be successful in our current role while others may be completely unrelated to the current role. And some are supporting but maybe not critical. It\u2019s the last group that organizations might include when they really aren\u2019t necessary.\n\n  * **Top-Down:** Our recent report with Harvard Business Publishing Corporate Learning in _How the Workforce Learns_ shows that our employees know their skills and skills gaps. So why aren\u2019t we asking them? You\u2019ll get better input along with better output to meet your goal.\n\n## **4\\. Measure, Monitor, Modify**\n\nYou need to measure but also monitor often and modify based on what you\u2019re\nseeing. Say you\u2019re looking at project management and noticing that everyone\u2019s\nlevel is the same. To get insight, you need to modify what you\u2019re seeing.\nPerhaps project management isn\u2019t the skill that distinguishes great\nperformance (and great performance is what you need to meet your goal). So,\nremove it and find the skills that are driving your business forward.\n\n## **5\\. Share Your Insights**\n\nThis one may seem obvious but too often we stop at the measuring stage, so we\ndon\u2019t fully realize the impact of our insights. These insights can lead to\nchanges in job requirements and the opening of talent pools. That can lead to\nmore growth. Find those connections in your data and share them, far and wide.\n\n  \n\nCPLP Is Becoming CPTD\n\nATD Certification is changing in 2020.

This statement: \"No\ndoubt due to a combination of human nature and fear of fallout from admitting\nto weaknesses\" captures that point -- when skill levels are used for purposes\nthat are largely punitive, individuals may inflate. When they are used for\nvirtuous purposes, like personalized development and career mobility, user\nrating are likely to be much more valid.

on\nAnti-Corruption (JKKMAR) had approved its recommendation to require listed\ncompanies to put in place anti-corruption measures and a framework to promote\nthe effective discharge of directors\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: The Securities Commission's learning and development arm has\nlaunched the Capital Market Competency Management System (CMS), an online\nplatform that centralises Industry Competency Framework (ICF), assessment and\ndevelopment acitivities on a common hub.  \n  \nThe Securities Industry Development Corporation (SIDC) said in a statement\nthat the CMS facilitates continuous professional development of the capital\nmarket industry by offering assessment of competencies as prescribed by the\nICF and identifying learning and development interventions.  \n  \n\"Based on the ICF, the CMS empowers individuals and/or corporations to assess\nand identify their own or their employees\u2019 existing competency levels and\ndevelopment areas,\" it said.  \n  \nThe CMS is set to be a game changer for capacity building and professional\ndevelopment of the Malaysian capital market.  \n  \nIt will feature the ICF repository, a Self-Assessment Tool, and a personalised\ndevelopment guide (the Development Advisor) based on the individual\u2019s self-\nassessment report that includes suggested training courses as well as self-\ndirected learning elements.  \n  \n\"CMS is a disruption tool which can help overcome the insurmountable\nchallenges and pave the map for the unknowns.  \n  \n\"Not only the future employees will be able to get themselves ready for the\nmarket, but the culture of lifelong learning is ingrained in the mindset of\nexisting employees,\u201d said SIDC CEO Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali.\n\nArticle type: metered\n\nUser Type:

Technologies,\nInc., a company leading the definition and creation of Unified Channel\nManagement (UCM) solutions, today announced it has launched an industry-first\nadvanced learning management system that is fully compliant with SCORM, xAPI,\ncmi5 and AICC standards.\n\nZINFI\u2019s Learning Management System Plus (LMS+) module is an industry first,\nallowing channel organizations to quickly build training, assessments and\ncertification materials for their channel partners. These standards-compliant\nmaterials can be delivered online via browser-agnostic technology.\n\nThe new LMS+ module includes the following core capabilities:\n\n  * **Courses & materials management**: Key features include course and course management setup and comprehensive tracking of behavior, performance and other activities on both desktop and mobile environments.\n  *  **Assessments management:** Key features include assessment setup and management in a multilingual environment with the ability to track and learn.\n  *  **Certifications management:** Key features include browser-independent delivery and client-agnostic certifications validity management.\n\n\u201cAt ZINFI, we are constantly expanding our platform capabilities based on\nmarket and customer needs,\u201d said Sugata Sanyal, founder and CEO of ZINFI. \u201cOur\nenterprise customers have been asking for advanced LMS capabilities so that\nthey don\u2019t have to pay an arm and a leg to a third-party provider for an LMS\ntool that is not purpose-built for the channel. This new application allows\nchannel organizations of all sizes to introduce an integrated partner\nonboarding and learning management path to ensure their partner base is always\nwell-trained and ready to go with the latest products and services. This will\nnot only reduce operating costs related to third-party application licensing\nbut will also increase the overall productivity of the entire channel program\nby introducing a competency-based partner management model.\u201d\n\nZINFI has received recognition for its channel marketing automation leadership\nin two separate analyst reports from Forrester Research. Most recently, ZINFI\nwas named a leader in **The Forrester Wave TM: Partner Relationship\nManagement, Q4 2018** report, earning 13 perfect (5.0) scores for a broad\nrange of specific evaluation criteria. Forrester cited ZINFI\u2019s horizontal\napproach to the market and its \u201cstrong engineering pedigree,\u201d noting that\n\u201cZINFI\u2019s PRM solution provides robust global capabilities with excellent\nfunctionality, flexibility through a modular approach, and infinite\ncustomizations for complex channel environments.\u201d\n\nZINFI was also named a leader in **The Forrester Wave TM: Through-Channel\nMarketing Automation, Q2 2018** report, which praised the \u201crobust\nfunctionality, modularity, and customizations\u201d of ZINFI\u2019s Unified Channel\nManagement (UCM) platform\u2014the only solution in the marketplace developed as a\nnative platform for complete integration of partner relationship management\n(PRM), partner marketing management (PMM) and partner sales management (PSM).\n\nTo access more information about ZINFI\u2019s _[partner relationship\nmanagement](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P2QOVxHI71iAeRINjtDm_Cxt78EWY9Mzt1a2BNsspj_gwd4aikZlbXlXdOOHWudoBs_NwbnzacJ0On5MLcLJ3SDlaxLKVNBkSMPl-3S5uT4=\n\"partner relationship management\")_ platform or to download a copy of ZINFI\u2019s\nbest practices guide on _[partner relationship\nmanagement](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P2QOVxHI71iAeRINjtDm_Cxt78EWY9Mzt1a2BNsspj91RT0MxdKupieLzkb-\nYMnyYsh9BCsuRCoI32SWBfZgw0gRVLj9wTcuKGPbTBoxxDGWGqzMDy8bl4PmBEAPv_AcsrQhi5TC5pUugLpZlKwm5BBbkGYTNiX5jPSMODTZjZA=\n\"partner relationship management\")_ , please visit our website at\n_[https://www.zinfi.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_Wqi3YpBQzgPCQJx7Wws5XH8kNVD7CYOjg7dwMSMSx8CwOafoLbvURMO_dln1IJ4-NELnCL9vHEcmuwmTRtT91DUrVjtGPxdyyPGF3NKP_4=)_.\nYou can also follow ZINFI Technologies on\n_[LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IiBAVvKte64NtVr04c2M4AIXnDxs0Jqt5UEGmHcf1glj3A5ndcP0qDV4xX6mmLGpZejMkIVLgM4H4OQkqeMBB1YtOrzuDTpopTfzuEqOEExjTej4cUlXeXbB7Ztflpwg\n\"LinkedIn\")_ and at the ZINFI _[Channel Marketing Best Practices\nblog](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OuA2Dd3-VUlCNGg3Uo402OgZmJku_dwdeQ9lt6yRqncOebBP-\nXnrLbzFU-gRjlEMfde8dn0LyUvMY7rx-\nzS8H7a5twq8q6NtylPsmVDx7J06OIIKg18YHJb5so12uXeY \"Channel Marketing Best\nPractices blog\")_.\n\n**About ZINFI Technologies**  \nZINFI Technologies, Inc. the leader in Unified Channel Management (UCM)\ninnovation, enables vendors and their channel partners to achieve profitable\ngrowth predictably and rapidly on a worldwide level.

I read analyses talking about how if anything it was a right wing\neconomic crisis and should get people re-examining their beliefs.  \n  \nI\u2019ve seen the point brought up again and again, by people who ignore the fact\nthat this Republican era began with and has been sustained by lies and lying,\nand creating a false framing that people believe like a religion (the Southern\nstrategy). It began with Nixon and dirty political dealings to thwart\ndemocracy, and was solidified by Reagan\u2019s trickle-down economics which favor\nthe wealthy and not surprisingly made the rich richer (and more powerful\nagainst government of the people), the poor poorer, and squeezed the middle\nclass. Reagan\u2019s own budget director, David Stockman, quit because, he stated\npublicly, the supply side theories were just a Trojan horse, a lie, to it top\ntax rates. Stockman is no liberal, but listen to Bill Moyers Interview with\nhim sometimes to see the only conservative to ever wake up to the damage of\nthe ideology. That\u2019s what that looks like, you won\u2019t see it anywhere else.  \n  \nWhile you think it is patently obvious that the wages of incompetence and\ngreedy sociopathy in government are more American deaths, and destruction of\nour economy, Republican framing to gain power is incompatible with connecting\ncause and effect. Look at what has happened already in many spheres of life \u2014\nhow many millions of Americans have died since the right wing attack on\nuniversal healthcare more than a half century ago. Ever seen the film by\nRonald Reagan likening Universal healthcare to communism? Even though all\nfirst- world democracies have universal affordable healthcare except ours,\nI.e. decades of American suffering and death for no good reason including that\nour system costs more by far, that fact would not penetrate that right wing\nframing - try screening that fifty\u2019s Reagan propaganda for a group in both\nsides and see.  \n  \nEvery other first world country has been able to achieve affordable high\nquality universal healthcare and we have not, because of the right wing\nframing. It\u2019s impossible to have a rational debate to fix things because the\nright wing mainstream arguments are built on so many decades of false framing\nand lies. Their whole governance model is currently built on lies.  \n  \nAs we speak, there is a large segment of the right who believe the Coronavirus\nnews is fake and spew all kinds of invective against straw men democrat\nbogeymen,who are portrayed as scheming, lying, corrupt, basically everything\ntheir own politicians are but they have been in the framing so long, they\nreject facts that don\u2019t jive with the ideology.  \n  \nThe right wing guy who went and shot up a pizza parlor with kids and no\nbasement because he believed H Clinton was running a child porn ring in the\nbasement, did not change right wing minds about anything when it was\ndiscovered how wrong he was. Most still believe the ring must be somewhere\nelse or the Clintons are at least capable of it because they are so \u201ccorrupt\u201d\nnevermind that there are no examples to base that opinion on that even come\nclose to the corruption of their politicians. There was such a coordinated\nassault on the Clintons because they represented the prosperity and strong\nfiscal management of prioritizing the middle class and poor, and threatened\nthe new world order of destroying democracy to favor concentrations of wealth\n(called permanent Republican majority and drowning government in a bathtub).  \n  \nThe fact that the wealthy were more vulnerable to this virus because of travel\nis still not going to incline them to public investments, sound and competent\ngovernance, and responsibility of those who profit from our public investments\nand first world standing to pay back so that all Americans can have the\ninvestments they need to succeed. The only way we get that, that this changes,\nis if the majority on the left wakes up to the right\u2019s long game and just gets\ninto the voting booths, overwhelming the voting, every every time, for all\noffices (not just president) while overtly countering the right\u2019s relentless\nattempts to destroy democracy. It may be too late  \n  \nI get a lot of the right wing stuff from relatives, and no one is saying,oh\nwait, I\u2019ve been awakened to the importance of competent government, rather,\nthey are doubling down on making \u201cDemocrats\u201d evil godless enemies who caused\nthis and just want to smear their angelic potus, so that 39% of the country\nwill truly think it makes sense that a president might hold the national\nstockpile of ventilators for the states that voted for him.

Because one party believes in destroying our government from the\ninside so that we are vulnerable to foreign enemies and have no ability to\ncompetently handle a crisis like this - just look at the difference between\nBill Clinton\u2019s very professional, efficient, and effective FEMA and the mess\nof heckuva-job Brownie under George Bush Jr and today. Ever notice how a\nrepublicans manage to always explode debt and deficit while cutting services\nand harming the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d (to quote the Constitution)? I\u2019ll tell you\nwho doesn\u2019t notice, it\u2019s Republican voters, whose main quibble against Obama\nwas the deficit that Bush exploded and a Obama slowed while getting our nation\nout of a great economic cataclysm caused by Republican corruption and policies\nfavoring the 0.1 percent and disadvantage for those at the bottom.  \n  \nI predicted the housing collapse eight years before it happened, including the\ntiming, because of those policies. Predatory policies that favor\nconcentrations of wealth and suppress opportunity and circulation of wealth in\nthe middle class and below make our nation vulnerable to economic collapse\nwhen things go wrong.  \n  \nWhere is the strong nation that used to be a rock for the rest of the world?\nHeaded by a petty mean spirited tyrant who treats more than half of its\ncitizens like enemies to be mocked and hated (you have no idea what is\ncirculating about you even now, regardless of the momentary restraint), and\nwho has so decimated the civil service, maybe he isn\u2019t holding back the\nstockpile of ventilators as a political favor to red states, maybe he just\ncan\u2019t find them because he has destroyed our civil service in almost every\nway, replacing competent civil servants with political hacks who hate the\ngovernment and departments they run or have a history of trying to exploit\nthem, and for years now causing a mass exodus of crucial and irreplaceable\nexpertise and institutional knowledge and function for the American people\nbuilt over decades. Republican persecution had already stripped most of those\nagencies to the wiring and studs.  \n  \nRead Michaels Lewis\u2019s The Fifth Risk. He set out to understand what three\ngovernmental organizations did, that he had no idea about beforehand. He\nconcluded that our civil service is largely engaged in saving American lives,\noften doing irreplaceable work that can\u2019t be done by the private sector,\ndespite a lot of mindless abuse (because of Republican ideology) , and being\nunderpaid for their level of expertise relative to the private sector. People\noften go into civil service because of the calling AND ARE NOT EASILY REPLACED\nas , say, random game show hospitality workers. Or contractors that never got\npaid. Or everyone who didn\u2019t get paid because of six bankruptcies. (Seriously,\nRepublican voters, you claim to value business expertise and THAT\u2019S the best\nyou can do? Two potuses in a row who bankrupted really large enterprises? Our\nnation is in crisis and the ports is concerned with revenge more than people\u2019s\nlives and economic futures. Our government is not a business, either, and it\u2019s\nheaded toward bankruptcy again, thanks to how Republicans have decimated its\ncompetency and pushed the economic seesaw so hard in favor of their cronies.\nAgain Democratic voters, there is no amount of evidence that will make them\nsee that, their misinformation machine has gone on too long and is in full\nswing - you must be less flaky about voting, and stop running stories about a\nfew flaky young people who have to get \u201cexcited\u201d by some personality or\nthey\u2019ll sit home and let our nation and world burn, and ignoring the young\npeople who understand how power works and are trying to get their generation\nout to vote and being actively suppressed.)  \n  \nSmart Republicans would vote for Democrats and instead of trying to\nrelentlessly destroy democracy, try to improve things instead of just trying\nto mindlessly tear everything down, as S Bannon exemplified but has been\nhappening since the Gingrich years and Watergate. The relentless assault on\ncompetence in givernance has everything to do with the crisis we\u2019re in now,\nhow many people have died and will die, and whether our nation will recover.  \n  \nWe keep hearing promises from Washington that in the past would have always\nbeen followed through on. We keep hearing double talk and false promises from\nthis one in the midst of crisis. Why didn\u2019t the national stockpile of\nventilators get sent to New York or Washington? Why did California get just\nsome broken ones? Why the shortages of PPE and distrust Bing quotes from the\nnepotism crew that the stockpile is not for the American people but for them?\nCompetence in government matters, and Democrats, the right is not waking up to\nthat, they are blaming straw men Democrats for everything bad that their guys\ncause as we speak and even hating on you for pointing out what is wrong and\nneeds fixing. Because you know, their false idol can\u2019t do wrong.  \n  \nIt has everything to do with politics, and the fortitude Democratic voters and\nleaders need to develop to avoid something like this again, and to get us out\nof this mess (again).  \n\n[Report Objectionable\nContent](javascript:showWhy\\('/square/abuse.php?w=1&ci=491933',\n'abuse_491933'\\))\n\n[Email Town Square Moderator](/about/contact/mailto.php?e=ts_moderator)  \n\n  \n\n16 people like this\n\nPosted by mauricio  \na resident of Embarcadero Oaks/Leland  \non Apr 5, 2020 at 3:11 pm  \n\n@Reason, your post is so perfect, i shouldn't even add a word, because you\nnailed is so perfectly, but I can't resist adding that between January 1st and\nMarch, when it was obvious to every sane person we were in very big trouble,\nDonald Trump tweeted almost 2000 times, bragging about how brilliant he was,\nabout how many Tweeter followers he had, etc. and not once did he mention the\nCoronavirus.

The true meaning of competency in the maritime\nworld, in my opinion, is just now starting to come into its own as a continual\nimprovement process within an organization to manage versus just be seen as a\nstandalone certificate for the individual mariner to manage, such as:\nCertificate of Competency (CoC), Certificate of Equivalent Competency (CEC),\nor Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW) certificate.\n_Note: the CoC is equivalent to \"licenses\" or \"endorsements\" in the United\nStates._\n\nWith the 2010 STCW Manila amendments and predictive shortfall of qualified and\ncompetent mariners in the industry worldwide, more and more companies are\nadopting \"a build your own\" approach to recruit, retain and develop a robust\nworkforce.\n\nHow companies approach competency varies, but there could be an opportunity to\nadopt a systematic approach for managing competency using a Plan-Do-Check-Act\n(PDCA) continual improvement closed-loop process by plugging it into your\nexisting management system. The International Organization for Standardization\nfor quality management and environmental management systems, ISO 9001:2015 and\nISO 14001:2015 respectively, both address \"necessary competence\" as a\nrequirement in Clause 7.2.\n\nThis PDCA competency management approach provides a process to move forward\nwith purpose and direction by identifying workforce risk and opportunities,\nwhich can be organized by significant impact for planning purposes and\nresource allocation. Plans to define and further develop job positions,\nespecially those tied to external \"certificates\", can integrate existing\ncriteria like STCW and the U.S. Coast Guard Towing Officer Assessment Record\n(TOAR). This type of learning is very similar to an apprenticeship style\napproach, blending on-the-job training (OJT) and classroom instruction. Once\ncriteria are established by position, the employee is trained, assessed when\nready, periodically monitored, and provided recommendations for improvement.\nThe approach is structured, systematic, and has shown a high degree of\nsuccess, especially with employee retention and engagement. Not only is the\nemployee continually learning, but those within the organization who are\nmentors and assessors also receive training and continually grow and learn as\nwell.\n\nOrganizations I have the pleasure to work with that have adopted this\napproach, achieve and continue to achieve an excellent return on their\ninvestment in the way of high performance and low turnover. In addition, this\napproach provides an opportunity to streamline and improve workforce\neffectiveness by further defining roles, responsibilities and authority.\nEveryone is clear on what is expected of them and how to succeed within the\norganization. Some other benefits include:\n\n\\- Identifying skill-gaps during the process\n\n\\- Defining succession planning and cross-training opportunities\n\n\\- Identifying and providing clear career pathways\n\nCompetency management is not just about training; it is about engaging your\nemployees and empowering them to be part of the solution to ensure you have\nqualified and competent workforce today and in the future.\n\nThe opinions expressed herein are the author's and not necessarily those of\nThe Maritime Executive.\n\n**MORE** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ ABS Leads EU-Funded Study on the Future of the EEDI ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/abs-leads-eu-funded-study-on-the-future-of-the-eedi)\n\n  * #####  [ North Sea, U.S. Gulf Producers Work to Keep COVID-19 Off Platforms ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/north-sea-u-s-gulf-producers-work-to-keep-covid-19-off-platforms)\n\n  * #####  [ USNS Comfort to Accept COVID-19 Patients ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/usns-comfort-to-accept-covid-19-patients)\n\n  * #####  [ RightShip and Human Rights at Sea Join Forces ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/rightship-and-human-rights-at-sea-join-forces)\n\n**EDITORIALS** TOP STORIES\n\n  * #####  [ COVID-19 and the Shipowner's Legal Obligations ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/covid-19-and-the-shipowner-s-legal-obligations)\n\n  * #####  [ The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Shipping ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-shipping)\n\n  * #####  [ Saudis Invest in Carnival Corporation ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/saudis-invest-in-carnival-corporation)\n\n  * #####  [ Remembering the U.S. Merchant Marine's Sacrifice in a Time of Crisis ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/remembering-the-u-s-merchant-marine-s-sacrifice-in-a-time-of-crisis)\n\n  * #####  [ Op-Ed: Call Someone Who is Alone ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-call-someone-who-is-alone)\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n  * [Print](/subscribe)\n  * [Digital](/subscribe)\n  * [Newsletter](/subscribe)\n  * [Renew](/subscriber/send_subscriber_email)\n\n[Subscribe Now](/subscribe)\n\n**RELATED** STORIES\n\n[Shipping](/shipping-news)\n\n[ ![file photo](/media/images/article/Photos/Oil_Gas_Energy/power-plant-\njapan.aa42ae.jpg) ](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/woodside-joins-\njapanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\n##  [Woodside Joins Japanese Green Hydrogen Consortium](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/article/woodside-joins-japanese-green-hydrogen-consortium)\n\nBy **[ The Maritime Executive ](https://www.maritime-\nexecutive.com/author/marex) ** 04-07-2020 10:08:27\n\nAustralian energy company Woodside has signed an agreement with Japanese\ncompanies JERA Inc, Marubeni Corporation and IHI Corporation to undertake a\njoint study examining the large-scale export of hydrogen as ammonia for use\ndecarbonising coal-fired power generation in Japan.

management processes and procedures have evolved at a blistering\npace, perhaps faster than any other part of the Human Resources discipline.\n\nPM has transitioned from an industrial-age framework focused on maintaining\nconsistent production schedules and quality to a flexible \u2013 and interconnected\n\u2013 tracking, coaching and talent development tool.\n\nTechnology capabilities and limitations often drove process design in early\nPMS implementations.\n\nOrganizations now require technology solutions that reflect their specific\nperformance management framework and focus on the competencies that enable\ntheir unique strategy.\n\n### Aligning performance management with organizational strategy\n\nTo design an effective performance managemtn system, organizations need to\nunderstand how each job \u2013 and the career ladders or development paths for\nthose jobs - feed into the organization\u2019s strategic goals.\n\nThat understanding provides the framework for how and how often performance\nassessment and guidance is conducted.\n\nIt provides a way to assess performance not just in terms of \u201cwhat have you\ndone for me so far?\u201d but also, \u201cWhere can we best use your talents and\noptimize your skills going forward?\u201d\n\nWhy is that so important?\n\nEffective and[ engaged employees ](https://www.betterbuys.com/talent-\nmanagement/hr-engagement-retention/)share a couple of common characteristics,\nregardless of industry, job function, or seniority.\n\nThey understand how their daily efforts make a difference in whether and how\ntheir organization achieves its strategic goals.\n\nWithout that understanding, how can they to rate their own efforts and see\nwhere they should develop strengths and overcome limitations?\n\nAn effective performance management solution provides the tools to answer that\ndeceptively straightforward question for individual contributors, teams and\norganizations.\n\nAnd, like individual performance goals, a PM system design should flow from a\nclearly-defined strategy. Otherwise, those systems can limit, instead of\nadvancing, that strategy.\n\n### Asking the right questions\n\nOften, discussions about the need for performance management approach the\ntopic at a tactical level.\n\nIndeed, many vendors\u2019 websites suggest that customers look at tactical drivers\nwhen they are researching performance management tools.\n\nThey suggest organizations ask themselves,\" Why are we looking at investing in\na new PMS?\"\n\n    * Compensation decision making?\n    * Administrative support?\n    * Developmental planning and guidance?\n    * General performance measurement and reporting?\n\nFor nearly every organization, the answer is, \u201cYes, all of that.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that there's a growing ecosystem of performance management\ntechnology providers that support those core capabilities. And that\u2019s fine as\nfar as it goes.\n\nBut that is also a problem. In the end, those are questions about the tool\u2019s\ncapabilities, not about the competencies required to implement your strategy.\n\n### Strategy drives competencies, competencies drive PM\n\nStrategy is the expression of an organization\u2019s mission, goals, objectives and\ninterrelated action plans for achieving each of those targets.\n\nThose are the factors that determine what competencies you need to build,\nmaintain and nurture.\n\nMapping strategy components onto various functions \u2014 product development,\nproduction, marketing, sales, management and administration and partnerships \u2014\nhelps define and prioritize the tasks that you ask each of your people to\nperform.\n\nAnswering strategic performance management questions requires the customer,\nand solution provider, to understand how each job \u2013 and any associated\ndevelopment plans and career ladders -[\nfeed](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-at-\nthe-c-suite-table/)[ ](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-\nthat-elusive-seat-at-the-c-suite-table/)[into the organization\u2019s strategic\ngoals.](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-\nat-the-c-suite-table/)\n\nAn understanding of the competencies needed to support your strategic aims\nprovides a framework for defining jobs, assessing performance and guiding\nemployee development.\n\n### Shared understanding of why, what and how\n\nIf each of your processes flow directly from strategy, you can trace\neveryone\u2019s work (actions and behaviors) from task to outcome.\n\nThat allows everyone to see how their work combines with everyone else\u2019s to\nenable the organization\u2019s strategic ambitions.\n\nWhen everyone shares a strategy-based understanding of job responsibilities\nand interdependencies, they are empowered to hold themselves, and each other,\naccountable for outcomes.\n\nThey can see where changes and improvements in their jobs might better support\nstrategy. And they can anticipate and participate in realizing those changes.\n\n### Feedback and adjustment\n\nSo, if everything flows from strategy, is this a one-way, top down process?\n\nNo. Like any successful living organism, companies, government agencies,\ncharitable foundations or any other group enterprise operate in an infinite\n[series of feedback loops and adjustment\nmechanisms](http://blog.competencycore.com/2012/08/linking-performance-\nmanagement-corporate-strategy.html).\n\nDesigning a performance management structure and selecting the tools that can\nbest support that structure needs to be a similarly interactive process.\n\nPMS design needs to include ways to capture and consider input from all\nstakeholders ranging from senior executive management through to line\nmanagers, employees and unions and, in many cases, indirect input from end\ncustomers.\n\n### Are you optimizing people or processes?\n\nWhen companies were measuring how many acceptable widgets came off production\nLine B, and knew they\u2019d be making those widgets for the foreseeable future,\nperformance was easier to assess and to manage.\n\nEmployees weren\u2019t expected to change tasks on the fly, if at all. Training\nrequirements were well-defined and could focus on a few specific skills.\n\nToday, however, you need every employee ready to quickly learn new skills and\nperform new tasks to support an evolving strategy.\n\nManagers need visibility into how workers\u2019 capabilities fit with their current\njobs and insight into any talents and interests that would be valuable\nelsewhere.\n\nWorkers need to see how their skills fit with current tasks and what new\nskills they can and should develop to climb their chosen career ladder.\n\nThat means both managers and workers need a holistic view of current and\nfuture competency requirements.\n\nAnd there is a real payoff: the more of a role your employees play in\nrecommending and selecting [skills they want to\ndevelop](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/career-development-in-demand/),\nthe more excited they will be to use those skills.\n\n### Performance management is everyone's responsibility\n\nOf course, these highly complex and interdependent performance management\ntools and processes are only valuable if used consistently across your\norganization.\n\nHere again, tying the performance management process back to strategy makes it\nclear to all stakeholders just how critical it is.\n\nLeadership support for and continued attention to employee development sets\nthe tone, but ease of use plays a huge part in how effective PM processes and\ntechnology solutions are for the organization.\n\nEmployees and managers need to be able to learn and use PM systems without a\nmassive time investment that takes away from productivity.\n\nThat means organizations need to make learning and using performance\nmanagement processes and tools part of every job description.\n\nAnd organizations should push PMS providers to continually improve both user\ninterfaces and user training so those meet your specific needs.\n\n### Measuring performance management ROI\n\nPerformance management systems provide powerful tools for developing and\nnurturing competencies, making them among the most important investments an\norganization must make.\n\nUltimately, performance management that maximizes workforce development and\nflexibility in line with a strategic framework is what differentiates\nsuccessful and less successful organizations - even in the most highly-\nautomated industries.\n\nThe return on your performance management investment can be measured in\nfinancial terms reflecting increased efficiency, reduced turnover and other\nmetrics.\n\nBut the true measure of a successful PMS implementation is a flexible,\nteachable workforce that understands and supports your strategy and that has\nthe resources they need to succeed and grow with your business.  \n  \n\n![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/newtimart-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Tim McElgunn](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/tmcelgunn/)\n\nTim, a member of the HRMorning staff, is a veteran writer and editor.

Dvorak](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=167717)\n\n![Rethinking Competencies, Part 2: What's After\nFeedback?](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/llj4fq86heafmzv6b_djdg.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * 360 reports aren't fulfilling their intended purpose\n  * Competency programs should include immediate learning opportunities\n  * Improving the behavior of a competency should be the goal of a 360 report\n\n_This article is the second in a series about rethinking competency behaviors,\nfeedback and programs._\n\nReading their 360 report can ruin a manager's day.\n\nWhat was intended to be a process for sharing input, offering encouragement,\nand giving feedback focused on development and growth, the 360 competency\nreport is now too often a list of subjective verdicts from colleagues who may\nor may not comprehend the job well enough to offer managers meaningful advice.\n\nIt's frustrating. Frustration is not the goal. The goal is learning and\ndevelopment, which leads to better performance.\n\nBut assume your managers want to improve -- and you _should_ assume that, most\npeople do -- and will take their 360-competency report to heart. They'll grit\ntheir teeth until the frustration passes, identify the advice with real value,\nconnect it to their work, and prepare to invest time and energy in a well-\ndesigned plan with metrics, coaching, and measurable development outcomes.\n\nAnd that may be when they discover the report was the least of their\nfrustrations.\n\nGallup researchers find that many competency programs pay far too little\nattention to growth, learning, and development, and focus far too much on\ncompetency lists and rating scales.\n\nWhich means the important part of the 360 -- what _should_ happen after the\nmanager reads it, what _should_ improve performance -- gets shorted.\n\nTo a manager who wants to make good use of 360 feedback, that may be the most\nfrustrating thing of all.\n\n### Making sense of reports shouldn't be so defeating.\n\nIdeally, a competency report should be [simple, development-oriented,\nunbiased, and the basis of ongoing growth, development and career\nconversations](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267026/rethinking-\ncompetencies-part-program-broken.aspx). It should be founded on the [behaviors\nverifiably linked to performance\noutcomes](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267017/rethinking-competencies-\npart-expectations-leaders.aspx).\n\nAnd that should be where the report begins, not ends. All those words and\nnumbers need to connect to individual improvement. Many companies assign\ncoaches to review reports with managers to help shape their reactions and\nsharpen their focus, helping managers see where they need to grow. Coaches\nhelp managers move past their first-blush reactions -- which may be, ahem,\nless than positive -- and toward a plan for performance they can really\nachieve.\n\nGallup researchers find that many competency programs pay far too little\nattention to growth, learning, and development, and focus far too much on\ncompetency lists and rating scales.\n\nEstablishing a coaching program may be beyond the reach of some companies, but\nevery competency program should include on-demand opportunities that allow\nemployees to act on feedback and start learning right away.\n\nThese development programs, usually digital and self-guided, describe each\ncompetency in depth, explaining why it's important to the individual and the\norganization. The best programs connect the employee with the organization's\nother developmental resources for ongoing learning.\n\nIn all cases, development should connect feedback from peers and colleagues\nwith the manager's job role by way of the manager's unique strengths.\n\nThat step isn't nice to have. It's necessary to have: research finds that\nemployees who receive strengths-based development show 8% to 18% increased\nperformance, 7% to 23% higher employee engagement, 20% to 73% lower attrition,\nand 2% to 10% higher customer metrics.\n\nAnd a Gallup study that included 49,495 business units with 1.2 million\nemployees across 22 organizations in seven industries and 45 countries, found\nthat workgroups that received a broad strengths intervention improved,\ncompared to control groups, by:\n\n>   * 10% to 19% increased sales\n>   * 14% to 29% increased profit\n>   * 22% to 59% fewer safety incidents\n>\n\n### **With a million ways to define success, why acknowledge just one?**\n\nThose results come from people who are developing their strengths to achieve\nperformance outcomes -- not fuming over negative feedback.\n\nFor example, a common competency is the ability to form strong relationships\nand partnerships at work. Fair enough. That's an important skill. But some\nmanagers just don't enjoy meeting new people constantly.\n\nThat doesn't mean they're bad at building relationships -- just that they\narrive at partnerships by alternate routes. Maybe they're great at ferreting\nout information and building relationships through knowledge sharing. Maybe\nthey're born strategists, always finding connections between people and\nprojects. Maybe they just prefer a few meaningful relationships through which\nthey influence many other people.\n\nIn all cases, development should connect feedback from peers and colleagues to\nthe manager's job role by way of the manager's unique strengths.\n\nThere are a million ways managers build partnerships -- there are a million\nways to do _anything_ \\-- but a competency list that acknowledges only one way\nneedlessly negates all other paths that lead to the same outcome. It fails to\ndevelop potential into success. And it demotivates managers.\n\nThat isn't what competency reports are supposed to do. They're supposed to\nhelp people improve.\n\nSo when your managers find a list of somewhat-insulting ratings in their\ninbox, you can expect they'll swallow their annoyance, isolate the feedback\nthat can aid their performance, and resolve to improve on what they can. But\nif those ratings are all they're going to learn, you can be sure they're going\nto be frustrated.\n\nThat isn't going to improve your managers' day or performance. And this\napproach won't help leaders recognize when new behaviors, skills, or attitudes\nare needed, or help leaders take responsibility for developing them.\n\nA better way is a better 360, one that lays the groundwork for development\nwith highly relevant and timely measurement. A 360 report that illuminates\nother people's expectations and helps managers understand how they affect\nothers. That's what a competency report should do -- and leaders should demand\nnothing less.\n\n### **Ready to move beyond the traditional competency report and learn more\nabout manager development?**\n\n  * Want to learn more about competencies?

Industrial services company, Bilfinger Salamis UK, has renewed its\nTraining Managed Service (TMS) contract with leading training provider, AIS\nTraining, to manage and deliver the company\u2019s UK training for the next seven\nyears.\n\nAs part of the contract, AIS Training will provide more than 450 industry-\naccredited technical and safety-critical skills courses, in areas such as\noffshore survival, emergency response, crisis management, rope access, rigging\nand lifting, scaffolding and fabric maintenance. It will also continue to\nprovide a full training and competency management service using digital and\nonline systems to manage course bookings, scheduling and certificate renewals.\n\nAIS Training has worked in partnership with Bilfinger Salamis since 2016 after\nthe company decided to outsource all training to one external provider.\n\nIn 2018, AIS Training became part of the 3T Energy Group, which includes\nenergy training specialist, Survivex, simulator developer, Drilling Systems\nand virtual reality and software developer, NeutronVR.\n\nBilfinger Salamis is benefitting from the wider Group\u2019s additional expertise\nincluding Survivex\u2019s world-class training center in Aberdeen, as well as AIS\nTraining\u2019s 20-acre training village in Newcastle and unrivalled technological\nexpertise.\n\nMike Henderson, commercial and business development director at Bilfinger\nSalamis, said \u201cWe are delighted to renew our contract with AIS Training for\nthe next seven years.\n\n\u201cWorking with AIS Training is a true partnership and we have seen significant\nbenefits from improved efficiencies, reduced costs and access to new training\ntechnology. Before working exclusively with AIS Training, we had to deal with\na range of training companies to deliver training that couldn\u2019t be delivered\nin-house. This could be time-consuming and logistically complex. Now all of\nour training requirements can be arranged through a simple TMS digital\nplatform, making it far simpler for us. As well as resource and time savings,\nwe have seen a reduction of up to 18% on direct course bookings.\"\n\nGavin Taylor, commercial sales director at AIS Training / Survivex, said: \u201cWe\nwork hand in glove with Bilfinger Salamis to deliver the highest standards of\ntraining management so are thrilled to have our contract extended until 2026.\nWe have a great working relationship and continue to promote innovative\nlearning tools such as VR to enhance our service offering. As well as\ndelivering industry-accredited skills courses, the service we offer Bilfinger\nSalamis utilizes our unique training management software (TMS) which helps\ncompanies maximize their training budgets. It means Bilfinger has instant\naccess worldwide to real-time information on course bookings, skills records\nand training information and can also forecast budgetary demands based on\ntraining matrices and certificate renewal dates. We are looking forward to\ncontinuing our great working partnership.\u201d\n\n# Related News ///\n\n  * [Gulf of Mexico operators move proactively to keep oil flowing during

Technology governs our work as well and demands that we stay\nready to adapt with agility and intelligence. With so much around us in a\nstate of constant flux, Human Capital Management (HCM) warrants a deeper\nunderstanding.\n\n## **1\\. What is Human Capital Management?**\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management, with the goal of achieving organizational competency for\nworkforce acquisition, management and optimization.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into HCM processes, features and strategies, let\u2019s take\na moment to focus on the key elements of the definition.\n\n**First** , HCM is not mere theories and rules \u2013 but rather a \u201cset of\npractices\u201d. The practical aspect of HCM is important because it points to the\nfact that in order to be practical, these systems need to stay relevant.\n\n**Second** , HCM is \u201cfocused on the organizational need\u201d. What might be\nperfect for organization A might be a completely wrong fit for organization B.\nThe point to be noted here is that while we are often bombarded with best\npractices for doing everything, the best practice to start with is often to\nstep away from the herd and find the best fit.\n\n**Third** , under the HCM canopy, we need to find the right competencies to\nfocus on with regard to \u201cworkforce acquisition, workforce management, and\nworkforce optimization\u201d. While the use of \u201cworkforce\u201d may seem a little dated\nin today\u2019s WoW (World of Work) of \u201ctalent\u201d speak, the definition does capture\nthe essence of HCM. Having said that, the practices under HCM need to evolve\nto keep pace with our growing relationship with technology.\n\nToday there are multiple HCM suite solutions available in the market. For\nexample, multi-feature, comprehensive suite offerings by Workday, SAP, Oracle,\nPeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer such a wide\nvariety of solutions that it leads to a decision dilemma in assessing what\nwould really work for a particular organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n## **2\\. The 3 core aspects of Human Capital Management (HCM)**\n\nHuman Capital Management covers a wide spectrum of talent acquisition and\nmanagement processes throughout the employee life cycle. To understand better,\nlet\u2019s divide the whole spectrum into three broad functionalities \u2013 **(A)\nTalent Acquisition (TA), (B) Talent Management and (C) Talent Optimization** \u2013\nand deep dive into the nuances within each of these categories.\n\n### **Talent Acquisition**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s always best to start at the beginning - where the employee life cycle\ncommences. To be precise though, it actually starts just before the TA\nprocesses with Talent Gap Analysis. Predictive workforce planning tools like\nSAP HR Analytics and Oracle HCM Cloud take into consideration the current\ntalent spread, the immediate talent requirements and business strategies to\nmap future requirements based on a holistic analysis.\n\nA comprehensive TA-centric Human Capital Management system needs to cater to\nthe needs of the primary TA process:\n\n  1. **[Recruitment/ eRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-recruitment/) \\- **This includes sourcing, screening, qualifying, and skill-matching\n  2. [**ATS (Application Tracking System)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)\n  3. **[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) \\- **background checks, joining formalities, orientation, and a 30-60-90 day growth plan to get the new recruit started.\n\n  \nSolutions like SuccessFactors, SilkRoad Life Suite, Taleo (Oracle talent\ncloud), ClearCompany HRM and TribeHR offer tools that focus on gaining access\nto and acquiring the right talent. Finding the right match in today\u2019s\nimpatient and volatile environment is as difficult as it is necessary. An\nefficient ATS, for example, not only makes the job of the smart recruiter\neasier, but also improves the candidate experience. Recruitment being the\nfirst engagement between an organization and a prospective employee, it\nmatters how well the system is managed.\n\nWhile smart recruitment algorithms and recruiting chatbots have made the\ninitial stages of sourcing and screening a lot easier, a comprehensive end-to-\nend TA HCM solution needs to deliver more than that. It needs to be able to\nhelp the TA manager with the processes of qualifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, scheduling\ninterviews and skillset-matching while helping to collect and store data for\nbackground checks, carry out joining processes and also helping chart out a\ngrowth plan for the first three months for the new joinee. A 30-60-90day plan\nnot only lends more credibility to the need for a particular talent bust also\nprovides the newbie with a business-goals-centric plan to get started during\nthe first three crucial months.\n\nHuman Capital Management suites can also make the first day at work a lot\nsmoother and a lot less daunting with conversational bots to guide the way and\nhelp in a preliminary orientation to software, processes and organizational\ncharts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n### **Talent Management**\n\n  \nThe nature of talent that present-day organizations have to manage has changed\nmore in the last decade than it had changed over the 30 years before that.\nWork is no longer a place but a function with teams dispersed across\ncontinents, freelancers pitching in and increasingly flexible work-hours.\nHuman Capital Management systems need to be aware of and conscious about these\nnew tweaks to the work ecosystem. Keeping that in mind, here are the must-have\nfeatures for a talent management HCM system:\n\n**1.** **Time and attendance**\n\n  * Leaves and Absence management\n  * Self-service application and tracking systems\n  * Biometrics and security\n\n  \nWith an increase in remote workers, freelancers and globally dispersed teams,\nmapping time and attendance while also maintaining security needs is crucial.\nTools like TimeAttend and CeiPal Workforce make it easier to track and manage\non-the-job timings, leave applications and security requirements. Moreover,\nHCM tools enable self-service by allowing employees to manage their data\nthemselves thus creating greater transparency and improved engagement.\n\n**2.** **Payroll**\n\n  * Compensation mapping\n  * Remuneration tracking and roll-out\n  * Compensation planning for gig workers\n\n  \nWhile the focus has been growing on the non-monetary aspects at work,\ncompensation and benefits would always remain a key motivator. No matter how\nhard we try to eliminate the transactional nature of jobs, at the end of the\nday, while the paycheck is not the only thing that matters, it surely matters\na lot. Using Human Capital Management tools to manage payroll has been in\npractice for quite a few years now since it is one of the easier things to\nautomate. AI-enabled payroll HCM like Zenefits and RUN help in mapping\nindustry trends to benchmark compensation plans for the different sets of\nworkers from full-time on-location to remote gig-workers.\n\n**3.** **Performance management**\n\n  * Goal-alignment\n  * Task-tracking\n  * Internal communication and team planning\n\nHCM systems encourage and enable better communication. These mechanisms allow\nanytime-anywhere access, help in planning goals, aligning individuals and\nteams on the relevant business objectives and also allow 360 degree task-\ntracking. With tools like Performly, AssessTEAM, PerformancePro and BirdDogHR,\norganizations can boost productivity in ways that are more congenial to\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)\n\n**4.** **Culture connect**\n\n  * Rewards and recognition\n  * Grievance addressal and redressal systems\n  * Weaving ethics into the system\n\n  \nWhat employees do at work everyday makes up the culture of the organization.\nWith tools like Globoforce and TinyPulse, organizations can build a branded\nculture of ethical behavior, recognition, gratitude and engagement. Moreover,\nwith Human Capital Management software, the culture can be translated to every\nemployee in all the functions that they serve and all the processes that they\nare a part of.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **Talent Optimization**\n\n  \nThe journey does not end with finding the right talent \u2013 it begins from there.\nIn that journey there can be no room for stagnation. Organizations need to\nconstantly try to create avenues for talent optimization \u2013 for individual and\ncollective growth, without turning on business goals and objectives. You need\nto future-proof your employees. Here are four ways in which the right HCM can\nenable that:\n\n  1. Career-pathing\n  2. Competency mapping\n  3. Succession planning\n  4. Learning and development\n\nWith a tailored HCM solution, organizations can not only train their employees\non immediate skill needs but also for the skill requirements of the future.\nCoursera, for example enables skills benchmarking with the use of AI\n(Artificial Intelligence). With efficient cloud-backed, data-driven HCM\nsystems, organizational leaders can make the right career-pathing decisions in\nadvance thus providing both the organization and the individual a map to\nfollow. Succession planning has been proven to a great way to optimize HiPos\nand the right HCM tools can help in decisions regarding the same by studying\ngallons of data. Tools like SuccessFactors HCM by SAP encourage diverse teams\nto collaborate better and optimize on the positives of having a team of very\ndifferent individuals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)\n\n## **3\\. The Right HCM Solution: Finding the \u201cSuite\u201d Spot**\n\nLike we stated in the beginning, when it comes to choosing an HCM suite, best-\nfit matters more than best practices.\n\nHere are some key considerations and questions when choosing the right HCM\nsolution\n\n### **1.** **Why do we need an HCM system?**\n\n  \nYou need to know what are the areas that need greater intervention, what are\nthe reasons that some processes have been difficult or stalled and what you\nwish you achieve with the investment in a new tool-system.\n\n### **2.** **What are the must-have and nice-to-have features we want?**\n\n  \nThe MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) priority\nlist is a great start for any decision. You need to be able to answer what the\nHCM solution must do, should do, could do and also what it would do in the\nfuture.\n\n### **3.** **Present budget v/s growth needs?**\n\n  \nTo answer this, you might first have to identify where in the spectrum you\nfall. Are you an SMB (small and medium business) with less than 1000\nemployees, an MM (mid-market) player with an employee strength between\n1000-5000, an enterprise with over 5000 employees, a well-established MNC with\nover 10000 employees or are you a cusp organization transitioning between\nthese segregations? Based on where you fall in the spectrum and where you are\nheaded, you need to choose a solution that caters to your immediate needs but\nthat is also dynamic enough to incorporate your future needs. Your budget\nwould differ accordingly.\n\n### **4.** **What is the level of customization you require?**\n\n  \nThere are multiple HCM suite players in the market today that offer need-based\nplans. Most basic plans do not allow for customization but you need to be\nclear about what customizations you would need.\n\n### **5.** **Are you ready to adapt?**\n\n  \nBefore you build your case for investing in a new or upgraded HCM solution,\nask yourself whether your organization is ready for the change. There is often\nthe need for training with the introduction of any new tool and employees need\nto be allowed some teething time as well. The organization must be willing and\ncapable of letting employees and HR adapt to the change.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the\nDifference?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/hris-vs-hcm-whats-the-difference/)\n\n## **The 5 Big HCM Trends for 2020**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse into the future and the five key trends that would shape up\nthe HCM space in the years to come:\n\n### **1\\. An end to worries about job-stealing-AI**\n\n  \nContrary to the \u201cAI Apocalypse\u201d narrative, recent studies point out that 93%\nof people are willing to take orders from a robot and 70% of employees are\nalready using some form of AI in their personal lives. By 2020, with this\nmentality seeping into work culture, employees would become a lot less fearful\nand a lot more adaptive to AI.\n\nThis would lead to greater, more effective human-AI collaboration in the\nsuper-job era, and better rationalization of high-value jobs and roles for\nhumans. It also means that HCM systems need to be set up to manage all kinds\nof \u2018employees\u2019 - human and non-human.\n\n### **2\\. AI will no longer be optional**\n\nAccording to a recent study by Oracle, 79% of HR leaders believe that failure\nto adopt AI will have a negative impact on their overall organization;\nhowever, only 6% of HR professionals are actively deploying AI solutions.\nRealizing this discrepancy will push more companies than ever \u2013 including\nthose that have traditionally been hesitant \u2013 to embrace artificially\nintelligent solutions.\n\nWhile more involvement and encouragement from the HR to create an AI-enabled\nwork culture would be ideal, the fact is that many HR teams are still\nstruggling with basic digital transformation and automation challenges. A\nstep-change approach is needed to ensure the drastic transformation - and your\nsystems need to be able to support this transformation with agility and scale.\n\n### **3\\. HR to lead the predictive analytics movement**\n\n  \nWhile many think of HR as a \u201csoft\u201d skill, the future of this industry is built\non the use of predictive analytics to make intelligent employee decisions. A\nrecent survey by HBR shows that 31% of HR professionals are already using AI-\nbacked data analysis to identify at-risk talent, source best-fit candidates\nvia resume analysis, and predict high-performing recruits. In 2020, I expect\nthis number to jump much higher.\n\nSmarter decisions backed by data and powered by predictive tools are on the\ncards, but what new skills do HR leaders need on their teams to ensure they\ncan make the most of these smart decision-making tools? What new workflows\nneed to be defined, designed and automated to ensure these smarter methods of\ntalent acquisition and employee retention are executed flawlessly\n\n### **4\\. Digital assistants will become \u201cco-workers\u201d**\n\n  \nDigital assistants, accessible through voice or SMS, work 24/7 and can provide\nnearly-instant, tailored responses on simple tasks like vacation balance and\nexpense approval to complicated subjects like taxes and benefits. Over time,\nthe digital assistants can even take on more sophisticated personas such as\nmentors, coaches or counselors.\n\nThe need to understand generational diversity at work better and in ways that\nare more actionable will be strategic to organizational success. Smart HCM\nSystems will create a seamless employee experience for everything from\nefficient and effective employee onboarding; day-to-day time-consuming tasks\nlike expense reporting; and career-defining initiatives such as coaching with\nreal-time, always-on systems that employees can access at their convenience\n\n### **5\\. Smarter, mobile recruitment**\n\n  \nWith the human attention span averaging just 8 seconds and the unemployment\nrate at its lowest in 50 years, applying for jobs needs to be easy and able to\nbe done on-the-go. Moving into 2020 and beyond, HR professionals will be\nforced to adapt their recruiting techniques to this new norm or risk losing\nquality talent to competitors.\n\nOrganizations need to create their employer brand based on candidate\nexpectations, technology trends, and the changing business environment. The\n\u2018last mile\u2019 between the job opportunity ad the potential candidate is a\ncrucial and vulnerable link - using technology to close that gap at the last\nmile with speed, accuracy and as per process is going to be central.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 5 Human Capital Management (HCM) Software Features for\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)\n\n## **Handle Change Meaningfully**\n\nIn conclusion, what needs to be kept in mind is that the right HCM solution\ncan prove to be a lot more than a system that simply manages data and\nprocesses better. It can be a tool to motivate your employees, to engage them\norganically and to provide an augmented employee experience through the\nduration of their employment or even career. That said, how well a Human\nCapital Management system functions within an organization depends on how well\nyou use it and how motivated your employees feel to adapt to the upgrade.

This accreditation supports Peak\u2019s\nexpansion to the US market, establishing itself as an AWS Retail and Machine\nLearning Competency Partner on a global scale.\n\nPeak\u2019s first-of-its-kind AI System is future-proofing retail businesses by\nproviding both the technology and capability to be successful with AI. It\naligns with business strategy to drive growth, enhance profitability and build\nsustainable competitive advantage from data. Peak offers outcome-focused\nartificial intelligence (AI) solutions and technology working across the\nentire retail value chain - controlling the supply and demand cycle, improving\ngrowth, profitability and customer experience. It works with leading global\nfashion retailers including ASOS, boohoo and Footasylum, and is on a mission\nto help businesses \u2018do great things with data\u2019.\n\n\u201cMany retailers are reinventing their operations and brand experience with new\ninnovations in the cloud,\u201d said [Tom\nLitchford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomlitchford/), Head of Retail Business\nDevelopment, Amazon Web Services, Inc. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Peak to\nthe AWS Retail Competency Program. Their solutions for retail operations,\npowered and vetted by AWS, can help our customers to accelerate their\ntransformation, modernisation, and customer engagement efforts.\u201d\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [ Prediction Series: Interview with James\nBarlow, Country Manager UK & Ireland at Akeneo](https://martechseries.com/mts-\ninsights/guest-authors/technology-giving-customers-power-back/)\n\nIn order to become an AWS Retail Competency Partner, Peak had to demonstrate\nsuccess in offering end-to-end solutions for retail on AWS as an Advanced\nConsulting Partner offering strategy and deployment services to retailers, to\nhelp accelerate their digital transformation.\n\nAWS Retail Competency Partners undergo rigorous validation by AWS to ensure\nalignment to AWS best practices for building secure, high-performing,\nresilient, and efficient cloud infrastructure for industry applications \u2013 to\ngive customers increased confidence when making decisions.\n\nAchieving the AWS Retail Competency differentiates Peak as an AWS Partner\nNetwork (APN) member that delivers highly specialised technical proficiency.\nTo receive the AWS Competency designation, APN Partners must possess deep AWS\nexpertise and deliver solutions seamlessly on AWS.\n\n\u201cWe work with major global retailers, such as ASOS and boohoo, who are\ntransforming and optimising its business using AI. Combining this with our\nexpansion plans for 2020 sets us up to become the global leader in enterprise\nAI for retail.\u201d commented [Richard\nPotter,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-potter-a7204831/) CEO at Peak.\n\n\u201cHaving been an Amazon APN Partner for several years, and one of the few in\nEurope with AWS Advanced Machine Learning Competency status, we\u2019re extremely\nproud to achieve AWS Retail Competency status. With AWS we are helping\nretailers acquire and retain customers with hyper-personalised marketing\ncommunications, make better demand decisions and have more efficient\nfulfillment processes.\u201d\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [NRF Vision 2020 Update: Channable Debuts in\nthe US with New BigCommerce\nIntegration](https://martechseries.com/mobile/mobile-marketing/e-commerce-and-\nmobile-commerce/nrf-vision-2020-update-channable-debuts-in-the-us-with-new-\nbigcommerce-integration/)\n\nLeveraging its partnership with Peak, UK-based streetwear retailer Footasylum\nintroduced AI into its social media and email advertising campaigns. Using\nmachine learning algorithms, Footasylum achieved an 8400% return on ad spend\n(ROAS), 30 times more than the industry average and ten times higher than\nFootasylum\u2019s standard marketing ROAS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gaining a lot from being an AI-driven retailer, and the results of our\nrecent social advertising campaigns with Peak speak volumes,\u201d added Tom\nSummerfield, Head of Commerce at Footasylum. \u201cAI and machine learning are\ncomplementing our marketing efforts perfectly, allowing us to speak to\ncustomers at the right time when they are ready to make a purchase, and\nscaling communication back when they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Retail Competency status strengthens Peak\u2019s position as it expands into\nthe US market, leveraging its close relationship with AWS to service a growing\nglobal customer base,\u201d continued Potter.\n\nIn particular, UK-based, global retailer boohoo is working with Peak to\noptimise its merchandising function. \u201cTrend-led fashion is at the heart of who\nwe are at boohoo, so we need to run our business at a pace which enables us to\nmeet our customers\u2019 expectations,\u201d added Ryan Short, Head of Business\nTransformation at boohoo. \u201cWe partnered with Peak to explore the opportunities\nof developing and implementing an AI strategy to further enhance our\ncompetitive advantage in this fast-paced market. We are already seeing\npositive early signs from deploying AI in our merchandising team and have\nplans to utilise AI across other areas of the business to drive greater\nefficiencies and ultimately give our customers the best experience.\u201d\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [Malvertising: How It Ruins a User\u2019s Day, and\nDestroys Their Trust in Digital

Often enough, the phrase human\nresource management system (HRMS) is thrown into the alphabet soup as well.\nThis is a classic case of oversimplification leading to complications. These\nare not exactly the same things, though they deal with the cornerstone of\nevery organization \u2013 people. HRIS and HCM are both systematic approaches to\nmanage people better and to leverage the human potential of every\norganization. That said, their internal systems and processes have certain\ncardinal differences that cannot be overlooked._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is an HRIS?**\n  * **What Is HCM?**\n  * **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the Difference?**\n\n## **What Is an HRIS?**\n\n[Human resource information system\n(HRIS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/) can be defined as a software or online solution that is\nused for data entry, data tracking, and the data management of all human\nresources operations of an organization. An HRIS thus deals with all things\ndata and helps translate that to on-demand information and insights.\n\nThe six key HRIS systems and working components that most solutions offer are\nas follows:\n\n  * Database management\n  * Time and labor management\n  * Payroll functions\n  * Benefits management\n  * Employee interface\n  * Talent acquisition and retention\n\n  \n**Learn More:[What Is HRIS? System, Model, and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **What Is HCM?**\n\nHuman capital management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management with the goal of achieving organizational competency by\nfocusing on workforce acquisition, management, and optimization.\n\nToday, there are multiple HCM point and suite solutions available in a rather\ncrowded market. For example, multi-feature suite offerings by Workday, SAP,\nOracle, PeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer a wide\nvariety of solutions.\n\nThe three pillars of human capital management are:\n\n### **1\\. Talent acquisition**\n\n  * Recruitment / eRecruitment\n  * ATS (application tracking system)\n  * Onboarding\n\n### **2\\. Talent management**\n\n  * Time and attendance\n  * Payroll\n  * Performance management\n  * Culture-building\n\n### **3\\.

Definition, Process and\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS vs. HCM: What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nThe primary difference between and HRIS and HCM suite solutions is that the\nHCM suite usually includes all the HRIS processes and systems under its\numbrella.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Comparing HRIS, HCM, and HRMS_**\n\n### **Does HCM have a wider scope?**\n\n  \nAs the figure below depicts, an HCM suite not only takes care of all HRIS sub-\nprocesses but also manages onboarding functions, **[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , position mapping, and succession\nplanning, salary/compensation benchmarking, global connectivity, compliance\n(for geographically spread out organizations), and HR analytics.\n\nTo provide you with a holistic picture, we\u2019ve also included a depiction of\nwhere HRMS fits into the picture, or rather how HCM and HRIS both fit under\nthe broader umbrella of HRMS.\n\nMost HCM suites today are trying to incorporate payroll and labor management\nwithin their functionality and thus expanding their span of control to include\nHRMS offerings.\n\nWhat needs to be kept in mind while navigating this HR solutions market,\nespecially in an age of digital and data dependency, is that there are quite a\nfew talent management (TM) point solution vendors who often dub themselves HCM\nvendors to elevate their brand and to expand their clientele.\n\nWhether you choose an HRIS or an HCM suite depends on the talent management\ncapabilities you require and the extra functionalities that your people\nfunctions will benefit from. Moreover, time- and labor-centric point solutions\noften market their offerings as workforce management, but that is not the same\nas talent management.\n\n![HRIS Vs. HCM Vs. HRMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Core features and capabilities**\n\n  \nThe core capabilities of HRIS and HCM solutions differ significantly. While an\nHRIS helps with recruiting, leave management, workflows, training, and\ndevelopment, benefits administration, self-service portals, compensation\nmanagement, and personnel tracking, there are often organizational needs that\ngo beyond the acquisition and management of data.\n\nCore HCM offerings, on the other hand, include all HRIS features along with\ntracking employee performance, [onboarding\nprocesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/), analytics (from all HRIS data)\nand workforce planning with regard to mapping the talent path ahead.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-people-management/)**\n\n## **A Matter of Choice**\n\nThus, while it might often be confusing to choose the right solution, knowing\nthe difference between HRIS and HCM is a good start. That, followed by\nanalyzing your unique organizational needs, takes you closer to making the\nright choice. While choosing any HR software solution, keeping the following\nquestions in mind always help:\n\n  * What is my current and projected employee strength?\n  * What are the issues we face with our present HR processes or HR software?\n  * Where are the process gaps?\n  * How well are my employees equipped to adapt to a new or upgraded system?\n  * What are the limitations with regard to hosting all our existing data on the new system?\n  * How flexible is it and how easily can we upgrade or migrate to something different in the future?\n  * What are the potential challenges that we could face?\n  * What are the must-have, good-to-have, and great-to-have features based on our needs?\n\n  \n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\nChoosing the right HR software is an important decision since every piece of\ndata helps you solve the larger people puzzle. Whether you go ahead with an\nHRIS or an HCM, your decision should be based on careful scrutiny of the\npresent scenario and your growth plans.\n\n_Do you use an HRIS or an HCM suite?

Candidates and\nCompetency](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/PMCMS/wtjz9fpuckq6gpzec-\ntxya.jpg)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his campaign strategists are clearly focusing his\nreelection campaign largely on the premise that Trump is a highly competent\nleader who has kept his promises and completed a long list of accomplishments.\nMuch of Trump's reelection\n[website](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy)\nis given over to \"Promises Kept,\" with detailed descriptions of what he has\ndone in office, category by category. Adding force to the message, the lead\nheadline on the official [White House\nwebsite](https://www.whitehouse.gov/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy)\nis \"President Trump Delivers 3 Years of Record-Breaking Results.\"\n\nMany of these touted accomplishments are economic in nature. Unlike the\nsituation for a corporate CEO, of course, there are no revenues, profits or\nmarket share figures to use to evaluate a president's competence. Trump and\nhis team are instead using broad, national economic data as quantitative proof\nof success. This makes sense -- Trump gets [more credit for handling the\neconomy](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1726/Presidential-Ratings-Issues-\nApproval.aspx) than any other issue on which he is measured.\n\nIt isn't clear, however, just how well economic success transfers to perceived\ncompetency. There doesn't appear to be much recent polling asking Americans to\nrate Trump and his administration on a \"competence\" dimension. Gallup did\n[ask](https://news.gallup.com/poll/260495/trump-seen-marginally-decisive-\nleader-not-honest.aspx) Americans to rate Trump on a series of other\ndimensions in 2019 and found mixed results. He scores highest (51% agreement)\nas being a strong and decisive leader, but scores significantly lower (43%\nagreement) on managing the government effectively.\n\n### **Foreign Policy Moves to the Forefront**\n\nIn recent days, we have seen at least a temporary shift in the nation's focus\nfrom domestic to foreign affairs as both Trump's supporters and his critics\ndecipher the implications of the United States' deadly drone strike on Iran's\nRevolutionary Guard leader, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nHistory shows that [these types of foreign interventions can produce positive\n\"rally effects\" for a president's job\napproval](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/169907/history-\nshows-attack-americans-libya-spur-rally-effect.aspx) \\-- but these are often\nshort-lived. It will take weeks or months to determine the lasting effect of\nthe Iran situation, particularly in terms of its effect on Trump's reelection\nprobabilities. He received a 40% [approval rating on handling foreign\naffairs](https://news.gallup.com/poll/268493/trump-approval-holds-steady-face-\nimpeachment-probe.aspx) in Gallup's latest November update, way below his\nrating on handling the economy and slightly below his overall job approval.\n\nBut, as evidenced by Trump's insertion of positive comments about the domestic\neconomy during his [White House address to the nation Wednesday on the Iran\ncrisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-\ntrump-iran/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy),\nthe president is not likely to allow his \"economic competency\" message to\nlanguish regardless of what is happening internationally.\n\n### **Democratic Candidates ' Competency: The Bloomberg and Biden Cases**\n\nTrump's reelection effort isn't happening in a vacuum, of course. To pry\nvoters away from Trump, Democrats face the challenge of presenting an\nacceptable, viable alternative. I don't find much recent survey data telling\nus how the Democratic candidates measure up in the public's eyes in terms of\nperceived competence, just as there isn't much data measuring perceptions of\nTrump on a \"competence\" dimension.\n\nBut based on their biographies, each Democratic candidate can and will make\ntheir own particular claim to being in the best position to manage the\ngovernment effectively. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg have served as city\nmayors, Elizabeth [Warren](https://www.biography.com/political-\nfigure/elizabeth-\nwarren?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy) was\nappointed head of a Congressional Oversight Panel and Assistant to the\nPresident, Amy Klobuchar was a county attorney, Tom Steyer created a billion-\ndollar hedge fund, and so forth.\n\nTwo Democratic candidates -- Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden -- seem to me to\nhave particularly unique opportunities to successfully claim a clear\ncompetency positioning.\n\nBloomberg created the eponymous $10 billion media company that now employs\n22,000 people, and then served three terms as mayor of the nation's largest\ncity. Bloomberg's presidential campaign is clearly using this backlog of\nexperience to counter Trump's competency positioning. Bloomberg's [campaign\nwebsite](https://www.mikebloomberg.com/getting-it-\ndone?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy) focuses\non his \"Strong Leadership, Big Results,\" a clear analog to Trump's \"Promises\nKept\" sobriquet on _his_ website. And news reports indicate that the\nBloomberg-Trump positioning battle will spill over into the Feb. 2 Super Bowl\ntelecast, as [both candidates are going to fork over about $10\nmillion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/us/politics/bloomberg-trump-super-\nbowl-ad.html?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy)\nfor dueling Super Bowl ads.\n\nBiden, for his part, focuses on his [unprecedented 44 years of\nexperience](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/257507/biden-\nthread-needle-government.aspx) as an elected official in the federal\ngovernment as U.S. senator and vice president. This experience allows Biden to\nclaim unique competence based on his understanding of how the federal\ngovernment works in all of its bureaucratic complexities. (On the other hand,\nof course, Biden can be labeled as part of the problem given his involvement\nwith an entity about which the majority of Americans believe is [\"almost\nalways wasteful and inefficient\"](https://www.people-\npress.org/2019/12/17/views-of-government-and-the-\nnation/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy).)\n\nBoth Bloomberg and Biden are septuagenarians (as is Trump), but presumably\nboth will attempt to exploit their advanced age by emphasizing the managerial\nand leadership advantages of their decades of experience.\n\n### **Who Will Win the Competency Battle?**\n\nBloomberg, Biden and the other potential Democratic presidential nominees have\na two-pronged challenge in their efforts to defeat Trump's reelection bid.\nThey must neutralize Trump's claims of competence and accomplishment. Then,\nthey must provide voters with a less objectionable alternative -- a candidate\nwho can convince voters that they are superior to Trump in terms of competence\nand the ability to manage the vast apparatus of the federal government.\n\nDemocrats have been hard at work on the first challenge, attempting to point\nout that the apparent economic success the country is enjoying benefits the\nrich while lower- and middle-class Americans struggle to make ends meet.\nDemocrats also have interpreted the Iran situation as evidence of Trump's\nflawed management, including Biden's [recent\ncallout](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-calls-trump-dangerously-\nincompetent-for-ordering-soleimani-\nkilling?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_276890&utm_medium=copy) of\nTrump's actions as \"dangerously incompetent.\"\n\nDemocrats' second challenge is more difficult. Only one person can capture the\nDemocratic nomination, of course, and each candidate has strengths but also\nweaknesses. Plus, Trump's focus on his accomplishments has been accompanied by\nan unprecedented presentation-of-self style that generates strong emotions and\npassion from his supporters, far beyond what has been seen in the past. It's\ngoing to be hard for any single Democratic candidate -- particularly a\nBloomberg or Biden -- to duplicate that type of emotional appeal to targeted\nvoters.\n\nIt seems to me that Democrats might think about a different, radical approach\nto creating and exploiting a competency advantage. They could present a \"team-\noriented\" front, establishing ways in which they would take advantage of the\npanoply of Democratic candidates' competencies regardless of who the nominee\nturns out to be. Candidates, for example, could pledge to tap into Bloomberg's\nhistory of business and mayoral leadership or Biden's vast history of\ninvolvement in the federal government in some capacity in any new Democratic\nadministration. Trump likes to position himself as a lone, singular leader,\nwhich could in theory leave him vulnerable if Democrats emphasized their\nintention to manage government based on the collective wisdom of more than one\nperson.\n\nFrank Newport, Ph.D., is a Gallup senior scientist.

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\nAccording to KPMG\u2019s _2018 Canadian CEO Outlook Report,_ 26 percent of Canadian\ncompanies are behind in soft skills training, development, and recruitment\ncompared to 48 percent of global companies. To address these numbers, future\nskills readiness and application agility need a new organizational framework\nin which creativity is both free-flowing yet systemic. The solution lies in\nthe flow of the reconstruction of work-design for employees, with the\nrecognition and measurement of competencies for creativity and innovation to\nthrive fluidly. Ideas and curiosity will fuel the new approach to work.\n\nFor a successful implementation of this new framework to occur , organizations\nneed to rethink how they measure performance skills and management in the\nworkplace. Many will need to deconstruct their traditional approach. While\nstandard measurements focus on predictive performance goals, targets, and pre-\nestablished competencies, innovative companies and leaders reconceptualize\ntheir methodology.\n\n**Redefining the Role of HR and Talent Development**\n\nMany businesses and organizations lack the creativity and innovation skills\nneeded for sustainable organizational growth and innovation. Talent\ndevelopment and HR are positioned to direct and influence leaders and\nstrategies that will help employees grow these skills. KPMG suggests the\nemergence of five new and distinct functions:\n\n1\\. futurist  \n2\\. shifter  \n3\\. shaper  \n4\\. modeler  \n5\\. transformer.\n\nThe futurist, for example, will adopt a forecaster approach to diagnose and\nreverse-engineer talent management strategies. The shifter\u2019s function and\nperspective, meanwhile, will be to lead the organizational culture on soft\nskills such as empathy, resilience, and agility.\n\nTo facilitate these new HR functions, cross-functional business skills\ntraining and cognitive intelligence synthesis agility, among others, will need\nto be integrated and adopted. This will call for more alignment and sets the\nstage for a new integrated performance measurement and management strategy for\nsoft skills competency learning and application.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom recruitment to the redesigning of leadership development programs,\naddressing the growing soft skills training gap in Canada will require a new\nmindset for embracing organizational creativity.\n\n**Enter Organizational Mindset Agility**\n\nFor 2019, LinkedIn research has named creativity as the top skill most needed\nin the workplace. This competency eludes many as it is rarely formally\nrecognized nor rewarded as a measurable achievement in the performance reviews\nof most employees.\n\nAt the root of this problem is the core mindset of an organization. In the\nbook _Unlocking Creativity,_ university professor Michael Roberto identifies\nsix mindsets that are barriers to creative thought and action in the\nworkplace, including:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00b7 linear mindset  \n\u00b7 benchmarking mindset  \n\u00b7 prediction mindset  \n\u00b7 structural mindset  \n\u00b7 focus mindset  \n\u00b7 naysayer mindset.\n\nThis information is significant as 77 percent of CEOs are struggling to find\nthe creativity and innovation skills they need in their organization,\naccording to the 2017 [PWC CEO Global Talent\nsurvey](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2017/deep-dives/ceo-survey-\nglobal-talent.pdf).\n\nWhat is missing is the celebration of the messiness and unpredictability of\napplied creativity due to the risk-averse nature of leadership and\norganizational culture mindsets and behaviors. Consequently, creative problem\nsolving and decision-making judgements for innovative solutions are limited.\n\nIndeed, curiosity is one of the first competencies for applied creativity and\npersonal leadership. Senior leaders can work with their HR and training\npartners to reimagine and design the full cycle of talent management and\ndevelopment.\n\nTo accelerate skill learning at work and plan an effective future leadership\ndevelopment program, consider initiatives that encourage intrapreneurship for\nautonomy and ownership of results. For skill variety, consider strategic\ncross-industry corporate partnerships. Ideas are the new currency for 21st\ncentury learning, performance, and innovation. The deconstruction of the\ntraditional performance management process will facilitate spontaneous\ncreative learning and problem-solving actions that are relevant to the\nbusiness and fulfilling to the employee.  \n\nTap Into ATD's Exclusive Senior Leader Consortium\n\nCTDO Next is a network of technology-forward learning and development\nexecutives determined to shape the future of the profession.\n\n[Learn More ](https://content.td.org/r/34504)\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Change Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Change%20Management)\n  * [Innovation](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Innovation)\n  * [Performance Management](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Performance%20Management)\n  * [Strategic Planning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Strategic%20Planning)\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/SamanthaMullings-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Samantha Mullings](https://www.td.org/user/about/SamanthaMullings-000001)\n\nSamantha Mullings is corporate strategist and consultant for  \nThe Sequel Training Group.  \n\n2 Comments\n\nSign In to Post a Comment\n\n[Sign In](https://www.td.org/sign-\nin?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.td.org%2Finsights%2Fif-you-want-more-innovation-\nyou-need-a-new-performance-management-process)\n\n[ST](https://www.td.org/user/about/SajeelT)\n\nSajeel T\n\nJune 16, 2019 07:04 PM\n\nReinvent the old annual review system and make goal setting and performance\nmanagement easier with peopleHum.

The 2011\ndefinition has provided a common understanding of the important features\nneeded in CBE systems to schools and school districts from coast to coast.\n\nAs Eliot Levine and Susan Patrick described in a release from Aurora this past\nweek, the updated definition reflects the evolution of CBE in the field as the\nmodel has grown to include schools from [49 out of 50\nstates](https://www.inacol.org/news/inacol-releases-updates-to-the-snapshot-\nof-k-12-competency-education-state-policy-across-the-united-states/). The\nupdated definition includes new features that place an emphasis on equity,\nstudent agency, and different pathways for student success.\n\nWith regards to equity, Levine and Patrick stated, \u201cCompetency-based education\nhas always been driven by the need for educational equity.\u201d They went on to\nnote that the inclusion of equity \u201creflects the field\u2019s recognition of the\nunacceptable truth that deep inequities remain. It highlights the urgency of\nmoving faster and deeper in changing school structure, culture, and pedagogy\nto achieve equitable student opportunities and outcomes.\u201d\n\nEquity is considered by many educational leaders, myself included, to be one\nof the biggest issues facing our profession today.\n\nIn the updated definition, student agency is directly tied to learning\npathways. Levine and Patrick noted, \u201cThe statement that students are empowered\n\u2018daily\u2019 to make important decisions about their education signals the depth of\ncommitment to student agency and personalized learning that is central to the\nshift from a traditional one-size-fits-all system to one that prepares youth\nmore effectively for their futures.\u201d\n\nAs our society has evolved and become more and more complex, so, too, have the\nneeds placed by society on our schools. Now more than ever, we need schools\nthat personalize learning to high degrees for all students at all grade levels\nin the system.\n\nAurora\u2019s updated 2019 definition of competency-based education is:\n\n  * Students are empowered daily to make important decisions about their learning experiences, how they will create and apply knowledge, and how they will demonstrate their learning. \n  * Assessment is a meaningful, positive, and empowering learning experience for students that yields timely, relevant, and actionable evidence. \n  * Students receive timely, differentiated support based on their individual learning needs. \n  * Students\u2019 progress is based on evidence of mastery, not seat time. \n  * Students learn actively using different pathways and varied pacing. \n  * Strategies to ensure equity for all students are embedded in the culture, structure, and pedagogy of schools and education systems. \n  * Rigorous, common expectations for learning (knowledge, skills, and dispositions) are explicit, transparent, measurable, and transferable. \n\nEarlier this fall, in a [MultiBriefs\nExclusive](https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/supporting-educators-\ntransitioning-to-a-competency-based-learning-system/education), I wrote about\nthe best ways to support educators transitioning to a competency-based\neducation system.\n\nI referenced a number of earlier MultiBrief articles I have written on this\ntopic, as well as a [webinar](https://www.inacol.org/resource/supporting-\neducators-transitioning-to-a-competency-based-and-personalized-learning-\nsystem/) that I co-hosted on the topic for the Aurora Institute. Many of the\ntools and resources I referenced correlate directly back to the seven design\nprinciples of CBE identified by the Aurora Institute.\n\nIn the 2018 Solution Tree book that I co-authored with Jonathan Vander Els,\n\u201c[Breaking With Tradition: The Shift to Competency Based Learning in PLCs at\nWork](https://www.solutiontree.com/products/breaking-with-tradition.html),\u201d\nJon and I placed great emphasis on the need for a collaborative teaming model\nsuch as professional learning communities (PLCs) to support CBE. PLCs empower\neducators to work interdependently to achieve the seven design principles of\nCBE, holding each other mutually accountable for the success of CBE and the\nadvancement of the vision of \u201clearning for all.\u201d My school has been using CBE\nfor over a decade with a collaborative teaming model serving as the backbone\nfor our work.\n\nAurora\u2019s announcement this week ushers in a new era for competency-based\neducation. I am confident that it will bring about new ideas and new\napproaches as together, we work as practitioners in the field to better serve\nthe needs of all our students.\n\nShare this article [](javascript:\\(void\\))\n[](javascript:\\(function\\(\\){window.twttr=window.twttr||{};var\nD=550,A=450,C=screen.height,B=screen.width,H=Math.round\\(\\(B/2\\)-\\(D/2\\)\\),G=0,F=document,E;if\\(C>A\\){G=Math.round\\(\\(C/2\\)-\\(A/2\\)\\)}window.twttr.shareWin=window.open\\('http://twitter.com/share','','left='+H+',top='+G+',width='+D+',height='+A+',personalbar=0,toolbar=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1'\\);E=F.createElement\\('script'\\);E.src='http://platform.twitter.com/bookmarklets/share.js?v=1';F.getElementsByTagName\\('head'\\)\\[0\\].appendChild\\(E\\)}\\(\\)\\);)\n[](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/index.php/content/a-new-\ndefinition-for-competency-based-education)\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/a-new-\ndefinition-for-competency-based-education&title=A new definition for\ncompetency-based education&summary=The CompetencyWorks initiative of the\nAurora Institute \\(formerly iNACOL\\) recently released an updated definition\nof competency-based education \\(CBE\\).

This means they need to have challenging\nexperiences where they, themselves, are engaged and developing through their\nstrengths. They need to be coached, as they progressively become more\neffective coaches themselves. Managers at all levels -- whether they are team\nleaders, managers of other managers or executive leaders -- need a well-\ndefined and well-articulated mission and purpose that everyone can easily\nrelate back to the work they do every day -- their contribution. They need\nclear expectations that are continually redefined with the ongoing, often\nchanging, corporate strategy. And they need continual coaching and\naccountability so that they can see their progress and potential. Finally,\nmanagers are much more likely to inspire big-picture, cross-team cooperation\nin their employees when they themselves are engaged. The teams they are on are\nmade up of other managers who are either on the same page or not. They see\nother managers as either allies or enemies. How connected your teams of\nmanagers are as a group will determine whether the teams they manage will\nsupport other teams or not.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/Jun19_06_1133638958-2.jpg)\nmassimo colombo/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/06/if-your-managers-arent-engaged-your-employees-wont-\nbe-either?language=es)\n\nMany CEOs and CHROs list \u201cculture change\u201d as a [top\npriority](https://www.gallup.com/itsthemanager/245324/manager.aspx). They know\ntheir organizations need to become more agile and adaptable to rapid\ntransformations and they want to be able to make good decisions and execute\nthem quickly. Furthermore, they especially want to attract and retain the\nbiggest stars. Building and maintaining a good corporate culture is key to all\nthese aspirations. Yet many CEOs and CHROs ignore the most important factor in\nbuilding the culture they want: managers.\n\nToo often, the very managers upon whom organizations depend to create better\ncultures are themselves unhappy and unmotivated at work. Management really\nisn\u2019t a great experience for most people; managers report more stress and\nburnout, worse work-life balance, and worse physical well-being than the\nindividual contributors on the teams they lead. Approximately two-thirds of\nmanagers are either not engaged or actively disengaged in their work and\nworkplace. Less than 30% of managers strongly agree that someone at work\nencourages their development. According to the people receiving manager\ndevelopment training, the programs in place don\u2019t work.\n\nShifting how your company trains and supports managers, and repositioning them\nas coaches, is essential for helping managers to change culture. The\ntransition from boss to coach means managers are expected to do a lot more\nthan give orders and delegate assignments\u2014a primary role is to develop stars\nthrough collaborative goal setting, future-oriented coaching, and achievement-\noriented accountability. Moving your managers from boss to coach not only\nincreases employee engagement and improves performance, but it\u2019s also\nessential to changing your culture to align with the [changing\nworkforce](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238073/millennials-work-\nlive.aspx?g_source=link_WWWV9&g_medium=TOPIC&g_campaign=item_&g_content=How%2520Millennials%2520Want%2520to%2520Work%2520and%2520Live)\n\u2013 a workforce that no longer wants, nor responds to, the traditional \u201ccommand\nand control,\u201d top-down boss.\n\n**Getting the Manager Experience Right**\n\nThe employee experience starts with applicants\u2019 first impression of your\norganization \u2014 how they perceive your culture and brand \u2014 and then how their\nemployee journey, from onboarding to development and eventually departure,\nvalidates those impressions. Top executives need to be aligned, consistent,\nand committed to the purpose and brand. That is the starting point for\nbringing teams together and effective decision-making.\n\nSecond, all programs and communications \u2014 including human capital practices,\nperformance management, values and rituals, and team structures \u2014 need to be\naudited for alignment and consistency with your organization\u2019s purpose and\nbrand. Gallup has found that this can be a quick process and we recommend\nperforming this audit annually.\n\nFinally, like their employees, your front-line managers and supervisors need\nto have jobs where they feel they are continuously developing. Managers and\nteam leaders need to have coaching conversations with their manager, just like\nthey are expected to with their employees. The best learning programs are not\na compilation of one-time \u201cevents,\u201d but rather teach fundamentals of coaching,\nincluding deep learning on strengths, critical employee engagement elements,\nand performance coaching.\n\nThe b[est programs help managers\ndevelop](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/242096/focus-people-strengths-\nincreases-work-engagement.aspx) within the context of who they naturally are.\nAll managers become better coaches by developing competencies such as building\nrelationships, developing people, leading change, inspiring others, thinking\ncritically, creating accountability, and clearly communicating\u2013 if they aim\ntheir unique strengths at each competency.\n\nUsing multiple modes of learning\u2014including ongoing e-learning experiences that\nadvance the foundational coaching concepts\u2014can help reach your managers no\nmatter what their unique strengths. For example, technological solutions\nshould start with a good foundation in human nature, not expect human nature\nto automatically adapt to the technology. This is a basic requirement for any\nhuman capital management system\u2014it needs to be progress-oriented, trustworthy,\neasy to work with, cool to use, and individualized. While there is an\nincreasing amount of \u201cnudge\u201d technology to remind and motivate managers to do\nthe right things, it\u2019s important that it doesn\u2019t become \u201cnag\u201d technology that\nis soon ignored or seen as a nuisance.\n\nThe right kind of manager \u201cnudges\u201d are those that leverage each managers\u2019\ninnate tendencies\u2014resulting in actions that don\u2019t come across as pre-\nprogrammed or phony. Great managers also adjust their approach to the\nindividual differences of the people they manage. A highly focused person will\nhave different needs from a highly adaptable person, for example. And a highly\nanalytical person will respond differently and have different needs from\nsomeone with high empathy. These nuances can only be leveraged through great\ncoaching, or technology that starts with each person\u2019s innate strengths and\nthen builds feedback or nudges that are quickly implemented through those\nnatural tendencies.\n\nHow do you know if your current management development program is meeting your\nindividual managers\u2019 needs? Ask them. Managers should strongly agree that\nevery tool inspires them, changes how they lead, can be applied easily, and\nhas improved their performance.\n\n**Exceptional Employees, Brought to You by Exceptional Managers**\n\nYou can\u2019t change a culture without great managers who themselves are having an\nexceptional employee experience. This means they need to have challenging\nexperiences where they, themselves, are engaged and developing through their\nstrengths. They need to be coached, as they progressively become more\neffective coaches themselves.\n\nManagers at all levels \u2014 whether they are team leaders, managers of other\nmanagers, or executive leaders \u2014 need a well-defined and well-articulated\nmission and purpose that everyone can easily relate back to the work they do\nevery day. They need clear expectations that are continually redefined with\nthe ongoing, often changing, corporate strategy. And they need continual\ncoaching and accountability so that they can see their progress and potential.\n\nFinally, managers are much more likely to inspire big-picture, cross-team\ncooperation in their employees when they themselves are engaged. The teams\nthey are on are made up of other managers who are either on the same page or\nnot. They see other managers as either allies or enemies. How connected your\nteams of managers are as a group will determine whether the teams they manage\nwill support other teams or not.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/02/110-Jim_Harter.jpg)\n\n[James Harter](/search?term=james%20harter&search_type=search-all), Ph.D., is\n[Chief Scientist of Workplace Management and Well-\nBeing](https://www.gallup.com/people/JimHarter.aspx?a=100075&p=1) for Gallup's\nworkplace management practice.

As businesses strive to become more\nsustainable, OSH professionals must demonstrate a range of competencies to\nembed good health, safety and wellbeing effectively in workplace cultures.\n\nFactors influencing change and transformation, including increased business\ncomplexity, technological advances, the gig economy and evolving platforms and\nprocesses, all challenge the capability of today's OSH professionals.\n\nThis new competency framework -  _Professional standards for safety and health\nat work_  - expands on strong technical skills, to include the 'soft skills'\nand business skills OSH professionals need to influence and drive change.\n\nThe 69 competencies are divided into 12 areas across Technical, Core and\nBehavioural categories.\n\nThey are:\n\n  * Technical \n    * Health and safety law\n    * Risk management\n    * Incident management\n    * Culture\n    * Sustainability\n  * Core \n    * Strategy\n    * Planning\n    * Leadership and management\n  * Behavioural \n    * Stakeholder management\n    * Personal performance\n    * Communication\n    * Working with others\n\nThe newly updated competency framework covers all the skills, knowledge and\nbehaviours needed by occupational safety and health professionals.\n\nIt reflects the findings of an extensive research project which included focus\ngroups, desktop research and analysis of over 250,000 data sets from\nBlueprint, IOSH's first generation self-assessment tool.\n\nVanessa Harwood-Whitcher, director of professional services said, \"As the\nChartered body that sets the standards for occupational safety and health, one\nof IOSH's key roles is to help OSH professionals keep pace with rapid change\nin the workplace.\n\n\"When combined with the enhanced tools coming from IOSH in 2020, the new\ncompetency framework will help to drive the highest standards of capability\nwithin the profession. In the meantime, it is a powerful resource that\nindividuals and their managers can use to steer career development and\noptimise team performance.\"\n\nThe release of the updated framework will be followed in 2020 by the launch of\nan enhanced suite of practical tools to assist employers and professionals.\n\nThese will include Blueprint 2.0, a new CPD scheme, new technical guides and a\nfree Career Hub for members, with access to thousands of learning resources\nand career planning tools.\n\nFor more information please

Instead, they go on\nindefinitely, delivering more business value over time. To sustain and grow\ntheir transportation management success, companies need to implement a\ncompetency center. This post summarizes the best practices, roles and\nstructure that leading companies put into their transportation management\ncompetency centers.\n\n#### Transportation Management Competency Center Definition\n\nA transportation management competency center is responsible for ensuring that\nthe transportation management strategies, processes, resource capabilities and\nsystems are properly maintained to deliver the value defined in the business\nplan. In addition, the competency center is chartered with continuous\nimprovement of the transportation strategies, processes and systems to enhance\nthe value delivered to the business or to support changes in business\npractices. The role of the competency center is not focused on day-to-day\nexecution activities but, rather, will have closer interaction with the\ntransportation planning and coordination operations if they are centralized.\n\nTo keep transportation management operations at peak performance and set the\ndirection for future improvements, the competency center must be responsible\nfor five areas:\n\n  1. **End/super user training.** The value that the system delivers is only as good as the capability of the people using it. It is critical to ensure that the organization is competent and that processes are followed consistently. In addition, there will be always be resource turnover and it needs to be anticipated. The competency center should build the training program to get new transportation system users productive, following defined practices and fully exploiting the existing capabilities of the system. New users should go through vigorous training and testing directed by the competency center to ensure that they can be as proficient as the initial users.\n\n\n\n  2. **Continuous improvement/business modelling.** Even the most successful transportation management systems can deliver more value beyond the initial implementation. The opportunities are always present as businesses are constantly changing, evaluating new strategies and learning more about their transportation management strategies, processes and system. The competency center should have specific activities focused on improving the productivity/service of existing operations by evaluating unused and new capabilities of the transportation management system. Modern transportation systems provide the ability to create multiple modelling scenarios to make those evaluations much easier by providing not only the potential business value, but the operational impact as well. Evaluating the feasibility and value of new business models and major operational changes should be one of the key roles of the competency center.\n\n\n\n  3. **Change management.** It is one of the most essential elements of successful implementations, major upgrades or changes in transportation strategies. Change management goes beyond use-based training to educate end/super users on the value of new processes and systems, and on how to leverage available data and reporting tools to manage day-to-day operational challenges and take advantage of new features. The competency center should be able to create business-level education and scenario based-training to demonstrate the business value of an upcoming change and how users can take advantage of the capabilities to make their jobs more productive and satisfying.\n\n****\n\n  4. **Reporting**. It is critical to long-term transportation management to be able to communicate to management and operations the transportation performance and value delivered, as well as to identify areas that need to be improved. The competency center should develop and get agreement on a common version of metrics, their importance and reporting strategies. The reporting should be divided into actionable and performance reporting. Actionable reporting should highlight issues that need to be addressed immediately to keep transportation performance on track. Performance reporting should take a longer-term view to identify trends and areas of improvement. The competency center should also be responsible for determining who beyond transportation should be leveraging transportation system information and promoting the value to those departments and trading partners.\n\n****\n\n  5. **System upgrade planning.** One of the reasons to use commercially available software is to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities and new modules that are available in future releases. Major upgrades can deliver a lot of value but take significant coordination and effort. The competency center should work with the vendor, operations team and IT to plan and execute the upgrade. Determining timing of the upgrade for the most beneficial release is an important role for the competency center so as not to create churn for the organization or fall too far behind. Finally, the competency center needs to coordinate staging and testing with operations and IT to ensure a smooth upgrade and help ensure that the planned capabilities and performance improvements are realized.\n\n#### Competency Center Organization\n\nThe competency center should be a training ground for top performers on the\nbusiness and IT side. The goal is to get the best and brightest to want to be\npart of the competency center as part of their career progression. A well-run\ncompetency center will generate the greatest long-term transportation\nperformance improvements and be critical to faster and more seamless adoption\nof new transportation business models and technology. The competency center\ncan be anchored by career transportation experts, but they need to be the ones\nthat embrace and foster change.\n\nMany leading logistics organizations are centralizing their planning and\ncoordination of transportation to lower costs and improve planning\neffectiveness. For those that do centralize, it makes sense to incorporate the\ncompetency center into the central planning organization. The close coupling\nmakes the work of the competency center more effective. Even more importantly,\nhowever, competency center work should be shared with the operational planning\nteam. Well-run planning teams are not busy with operations work all day and\nhave time to perform some of the continuous improvement and new scenario\nplanning. These resources also benefit from learning more about the system and\nnew strategies and processes, which helps them become even better planners.\n\n#### Roles\n\nThe competency center needs to balance domain and technology expertise to get\nthe most out of the transportation management system. The following roles are\nessential to creating an effective competency center:\n\n#### Center lead\n\nReports to head of transportation/logistics/supply chain. It should be someone\nwho is viewed as a pragmatic visionary, able to establish a vision and action\nplan, communicate effectively and influence transportation operations.\n\n#### Domain experts\n\nResources with deep knowledge in transportation operations, knowledge of the\nsystems deployed and ability to break down problems/opportunities in ways that\ncan be understood by the rest of the organization. These experts should\nprovide a bridge between the current environment and new ones and establish\nrequired processes and practices to get there.\n\n#### IT Process experts\n\nBusiness technical experts with knowledge of the flow of information,\noptimization technology, data analysis and reporting to help users leverage\nthe capabilities and data within the system. These resources will also\ncoordinate the efforts of the core IT organization or vendor if the system is\ncloud-based.\n\nThe transportation management competency center is an important part of the\nstrategy to successfully implement, sustain and grow the value of a\ntransportation management system. Rather than looking at it as incremental\ncost, logistics organizations need to understand it as an asset that will more\nthan pay for itself.

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\nWith the release of its new [Talent Management Capability\nModel](https://www.td.org/capability-model/access), the Association for Talent\nDevelopment serves TD professionals with the most comprehensive compilation of\nskills, concepts, and strategies necessary to fulfill their roles. It is\nimportant to emphasize that those efforts can achieve maximum impact only when\nguided by a comprehensive talent management (TM) strategy.\n\nATD\u2019s new model groups capabilities into three domains: building personal\ncapability, developing professional capability, and impacting organizational\ncapability. Talent strategy and management is one of the model\u2019s 23\ncapabilities and resides in the impacting organizational capability domain.\n\nA TD professional with capability in talent strategy and management will need\nknowledge of:  \n\n  * talent management functions (for example, workforce planning, acquisition, employee development, performance management, and compensation and rewards)\n  * succession planning and talent review processes (for example, assessment, scenario planning, talent mobility, and critical roles identification) \n  * methods to identify the critical requirements of tasks, jobs, and roles (for example, job analysis, competency modeling, and leadership competency development), \n  * talent acquisition strategies and concepts (for example, talent mobility, employment branding, sourcing, passive and active recruiting, and onboarding), and approaches for identifying and developing high potential talent.\n\nAccording to _[Capabilities for Talent\nDevelopment](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-development )_\n(ATD Press), to fulfill capability requirements, TD professionals need to be\nskilled at:  \n\n  * creating and aligning the talent development vision and strategy with the organizational and business vision and strategy \n  * designing and implementing strategic plans for talent development projects, programs, or functions \n  * identifying anticipated constraints or problems affecting talent development initiatives (for example, resource deficiencies or lack of support) \n  * establishing and executing a marketing strategy to promote talent development \n  * communicating how talent development strategies and solutions support the achievement of targeted business and organizational results\n  * communicating the value of learning and professional development \n  * developing workforce plans that articulate current and future talent and skill requirements designing and implementing a performance management strategy.\n\nAmong TD veterans recognized for leadership in this area is Martha Soehren,\nwho transitioned from CTDO to senior vice president of HR at Comcast in\nNovember as she prepares for a July 2020 retirement. Throughout her career,\nSoehren has appreciated the importance of a multifaceted talent management\nstrategy built on fundamentals.\n\n\u201cFor a TM strategy to work effectively, it must be embraced from the top\ndown,\u201d she insists. \u201cOver time, it evolves from the bottom up, especially in\nthe evaluation of talent and the determination of successors for key roles\nwithin the organization.\u201d She adds that it\u2019s important to build a \u201cholistic\nsupport system\u201d for such activities rather than conduct them on a piecemeal\nbasis.\n\nThose activities must be tightly connected to development, Soehren says.\n\u201cRegardless of whether that development is formal or informal, internal or\nexternal, high potential or broad-based, there must be a way to help build\nfuture capabilities so that people can progress and align with both short- and\nlong-term objectives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most importantly, she believes, talent management and development must be\nrigidly aligned with the business.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not easy and people don\u2019t always do it,\u201d Soehren observes. \u201cAfter all,\nit\u2019s difficult to build those relationships that get you a \u2018seat at the\ntable.\u2019 We have to earn that seat by showing that we\u2019re learning the business,\nthat we\u2019re operationally focused, that we \u2018get\u2019 L&D, and that we achieve\nmeasurable impact to support our initiatives.\u201d\n\nSoehren believes that some TD professionals are often \u201cso tied up with the\ndidactics of L&D that they overlook the connection between learning impact and\nbusiness impact.\u201d She says some have even abandoned the practice of measuring\nTD impacts entirely because their companies don\u2019t expect a return-on-\ninvestment of training.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sure not my world,\u201d she muses. Comcast\u2019s senior executives expect to\nknow the precise difference that learning makes for employees and hold her\naccountable. The scenario includes a heightened priority regarding inclusion\nof women and people of color in the workforce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes that accountability can surface in ways one can\u2019t envision, such as\nin 2014 when Comcast announced its intent to acquire Time Warner. Comcast\nUniversity was ordered to identify top talent within Time Warner for possible\nreassignment to new roles within the combined company. For six months, Soehren\nand teammates visited Time Warner markets to meet with key talent and high\npotentials for the proposed new organization.\n\nThe merger was ultimately quashed by the U.S. Justice Department but not\nbefore Soehren and colleagues learned some valuable lessons. Among them: \u201cWhen\nyou\u2019re going through that period of analysis, you have to evaluate the best\n_and_ the weakest of both companies so that you emerge with the best of the\nbest,\u201d she reports.\n\nShe says that\u2019s not an easy process because \u201cyou must accept that your own\nteam isn\u2019t composed of all A players, and that this is an opportunity to up\nyour game for your organization.\u201d\n\nSoehren also has strategic thoughts about the future of her profession. \u201cIn\nthe world of L&D, we haven\u2019t nailed down what it means to work and lead within\na global, digital organization. Learning leaders have a great opportunity to\ndefine what that looks like and set the stage for success\u2014not just for the\nlearning organization but for business leaders too,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cLearning leaders, trainers and program managers will all be operating and\ntraining differently. They will have to learn a new kind of software set and\nother technologies. As a result, I believe most L&D professionals will become\nlearning coaches and learning builders.\u201d  \n\nExplore the Talent Development Capability Model\n\nATD's new Talent Development Capability Model sets the standard for what TD\nprofessionals should know and do to be successful.

A recent research paper suggests the addition of seven more. But are\nwe just compensating for the lack of a true competency framework?\n\nby Lucien Canton  /  June 17, 2019\n\nIn my last blog I reviewed nine common characteristics of emergency managers\nfound in a survey of the current research literature by researchers Jenna\nTyler and Abdul-Akeem Sadiq. These characteristics are technical and\nsubstantive knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal relations, management,\nleadership, legal and ethical behavior, problem solving, communication, and\ncultural and environmental awareness. While these characteristics seem\ncomprehensive, in their paper, _The Essential Skill Set of a Resilient\nEmergency Management_ , recently published in the _[Journal of Emergency\nManagement](http://jem.allentrack2.net/cgi-bin/main.plex \"Journal of Emergency\nManagement\")_ , Tyler and Sadiq argue that there are other characteristics\nthat have received less attention. They offer an even more comprehensive list\nbased on the concept of a \"resilient emergency manager\".\n\nTyler and Sadiq acknowledge that \"resilience\" is a term with many definitions\nand attributes. However, there is agreement on the goal of resilience:\nIncreased resilience better positions a community to deal with disaster. They\nextend this concept to individual emergency managers: The more resilient the\nemergency manager, the better prepared they are to cope with disaster.\nUnfortunately, they define a resilient emergency manager as one who has the\nability to perform the skills that Tyler and Sadiq attribute to a resilient\nemergency manager rather than offering a more detailed definition.\n\nAccording to Tyler and Sadiq, a resilient emergency manager should be able to:\n\n  1. Adapt to changing conditions\n  2. Make agile decisions\n  3. Function interoperably\n  4. Mobilize resources\n  5. Scale programs, policies, and procedures\n  6. Develop robust collaborative networks\n  7. Build redundant emergency management systems\n\nWhile I cannot disagree with the importance of the skill sets identified by\nTyler and Sadiq, I'm not sure what they add to our understanding of the skills\nand competencies required of an emergency manager. From my perspective, the\nskills called for by Tyler and Sadiq are already contained within the\ncharacteristics they identified in their review of existing research. For\nexample, agile decision-making and adaptability would seem to be included in\nleadership while mobilizing resources and program administration is part of\nmanagement. This suggests that we are merely slicing the apple thinner and are\nno closer to agreeing on what constitutes the essential skill set for an\nemergency manager.\n\nIt seems to me that the real issue is that we still lack a competency\nframework that defines the role of emergency managers. Lacking such a\ndefinition, researchers are at a distinct disadvantage when trying to identify\nessential characteristics and required skills and competencies. Emergency\nmanagement is not monolithic; emergency managers are called on to fulfill many\ndifferent positions at varying levels, making defining a single set of\ncharacteristics applicable to all extremely difficult.\n\nI believe the value of Tyler and Sadiq's paper lies in its refinement of\nexisting characteristics rather than as an addition to them as Tyler and Sadiq\nsuggest. I certainly agree with their recommendation that emergency management\neducation programs focus on essential skills as much as they do on emergency\nmanagement topics. However, until we fully define the roles of emergency\nmanagers with an accepted competency framework, I'm afraid we're doomed to\nkeep arguing over endless lists of skills and competencies.\n\n[ MORE FROM Managing Crisis ](https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-\nblogs/managing-crisis)\n\n### {{currentBlog.blogger.name}}\n\n![{{currentBlog.blogger.name}}]({{currentBlog.blogger.image}})\n\n{{currentBlog.description}}\n\n[ ](mailto:{{currentBlog.blogger.email}}) [\n](https://twitter.com/{{currentBlog.blogger.twitter_handle}}) [\n]({{currentBlog.blogger.rss}})\n\n### POPULAR\n\n  * [\n\n#### \"All-hazards\" Doesn't Mean \"Plan for Everything\"\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/Allhazards-\nDoesnt-Mean-Plan-for-Everything.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Competencies and Capabilities: Is There a Difference?\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/Competencies-\nand-Capabilities-Is-There-a-Difference.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Are We Too Dependent on the Incident Command System?\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/Are-We-Too-\nDependent-on-the-Incident-Command-System.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Characteristics of Effective Emergency Managers (Part 1)\n\n](https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/characteristics-\nof-effective-emergency-managers-part-1.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Emergency Managers Need To Understand Their True Role\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/Emergency-\nManagers-Need-To-Understand-Their-True-Role.html)\n\n[MORE NEWS](/news)\n\n### Past Blogs\n\n  * [\n\n#### Strategic Crisis Management: Do Emergency Managers Have a Role?\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/strategic-\ncrisis-management-do-emergency-managers-have-a-role.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Characteristics of Effective Emergency Managers (Part 2)\n\n](https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/characteristics-\nof-effective-emergency-managers-part-2.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Characteristics of Effective Emergency Managers (Part 1)\n\n](https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/characteristics-\nof-effective-emergency-managers-part-1.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Do Emergency Managers Have A High Tolerance for Ambiguity?\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/do-emergency-\nmanagers-have-a-high-tolerance-for-ambiguity.html)\n\n  * [\n\n#### Who's to Blame for Failure to Warn?\n\n](https://www.emergencymgmt.com/emergency-blogs/managing-crisis/whos-to-blame-\nfor-failure-to-warn.html)\n\nSPONSORED ARTICLES\n\n[ ![](https://media2.govtech.com/images/400*266/covid-article-9-sm.jpg)\n](https://www.govtech.com/products/How-to-Work-Remotely-Tips-for-Remote-\nWorkers.html?promo_code=article)\n\n### [How to Work Remotely: Tips for Remote Workers Using Persistent\nCollaboration Tools](https://www.govtech.com/products/How-to-Work-Remotely-\nTips-for-Remote-Workers.html?promo_code=article)\n\nTools to help keep your teams on track even when they\u2019re apart.\n\n[\n![](https://media2.govtech.com/images/400*266/Buffalo+Computer_Main+Image.jpg)\n](https://www.govtech.com/em/preparedness/Tools-to-Help-Manage-\nCOVID-19.html?promo_code=article)\n\n### [Tools to Help Manage\nCOVID-19](https://www.govtech.com/em/preparedness/Tools-to-Help-Manage-\nCOVID-19.html?promo_code=article)\n\nSoftware tools to improve situational awareness and decision making during\nCOVID-19 response.\n\n[\n![](https://media2.govtech.com/images/400*266/Coronavirus_OpenGov_Main+Image.jpg)\n](https://www.govtech.com/computing/3-Ways-Governments-Can-and-Are-Using-\nOpenGov-During-the-Coronavirus-Crisis.html?promo_code=article)\n\n### [3 Ways Governments Can and Are Using OpenGov During the Coronavirus\nCrisis](https://www.govtech.com/computing/3-Ways-Governments-Can-and-Are-\nUsing-OpenGov-During-the-Coronavirus-Crisis.html?promo_code=article)\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is profoundly affecting governments, economies, and\nresidents worldwide.\n\nPlatforms & Programs\n\n[ ](/education)\n\n[ ](/cdg)\n\n[ ](/em)\n\n[ ](/fs)\n\n[ ](/districts)\n\n[ ![](https://media.erepublic.com/image/GT_NAV_1Asset_3GT_NAV_1.svg)\n](/navigator)\n\nGT Logo\n\n[\u00a9 2020 All rights reserved. e.Republic](//www.erepublic.com)  \n[California Residents -

The training module is for testing laboratories,\nsuch as food and beverage, cannabis, agriculture, water, and soil, enabling\nthem to meet ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accreditation requirements. The module helps\nlaboratories manage, and track training and certification of laboratory\npersonnel to ensure that only trained, certified and competent personnel can\nperform analytical tests.  \n  \nISO/IEC 17025:2017 is an international standard for the accreditation of\ntesting laboratories to assure quality. It requires all testing laboratories\nto assess the competency of laboratory personnel to ensure that they are\ncapable to operate specific equipment, perform tests and/or calibrations,\ndevelop methods, evaluate, analyze and validate results, approve test reports\nand calibration certificates using signatures. With CloudLIMS' training\nmodule, a laboratory can schedule and plan training, assign testing to trained\npersonnel and keep personnel informed of upcoming training events. A\ncompetency report can also be generated for the entire laboratory staff along\nwith training undertaken by the individual.  \n  \nKey benefits of the training module include:\n\n  * Managing and tracking the skills and training of staff\n  * Scheduling and inviting an individual or a group for training\n  * Managing training details and attendance\n  * Marking competence and certifying laboratory personnel\n  * Assigning instrument calibration and test & validation tasks to competent staff\n  * Generating competency reports\n\n  \n\n[FURTHER INFORMATION](https://www.technologynetworks.com/applied-\nsciences/go/lc/further-information-324104)     Advertisement  \n\n#### Related Product News\n\n[ ![Wyatt Technology Pioneers Multi-CQA Method for Gene\nVectors](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/placeholder.jpg)\n![Wyatt Technology Pioneers Multi-CQA Method for Gene\nVectors](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/wyatt-\ntechnology-pioneers-multi-cqa-method-for-gene-vectors-333210.jpg?v=10660905)\n](/applied-sciences/product-news/wyatt-technology-pioneers-multi-cqa-method-\nfor-gene-vectors-333210) [\n\n**Wyatt Technology Pioneers Multi-CQA Method for Gene Vectors**\n\n](/applied-sciences/product-news/wyatt-technology-pioneers-multi-cqa-method-\nfor-gene-vectors-333210) [Product News](/applied-sciences/product-news)\n\nWyatt Technology has announced the release of a novel method suitable for\ndetermining multiple critical quality attributes of adeno-associated virus and\nsimilar small gene vectors, in a single chromatographic run.\n\n[READ MORE __](/applied-sciences/product-news/wyatt-technology-pioneers-multi-\ncqa-method-for-gene-vectors-333210)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![New Recommendations for Assessing the Cardiac Safety of New\nMedicines](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/placeholder.jpg)\n![New Recommendations for Assessing the Cardiac Safety of New\nMedicines](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/new-\nrecommendations-for-assessing-the-cardiac-safety-of-new-\nmedicines-333149.jpg?v=10659531) ](/applied-sciences/product-news/new-\nrecommendations-for-assessing-the-cardiac-safety-of-new-medicines-333149) [\n\n**New Recommendations for Assessing the Cardiac Safety of New Medicines**\n\n](/applied-sciences/product-news/new-recommendations-for-assessing-the-\ncardiac-safety-of-new-medicines-333149) [Product News](/applied-\nsciences/product-news)\n\nMetrion Biosciences has contributed to two new papers that focus on the\napplication of improved cardiac safety testing protocols and recommendations\nfor best practice for the drug discovery industry.\n\n[READ MORE __](/applied-sciences/product-news/new-recommendations-for-\nassessing-the-cardiac-safety-of-new-medicines-333149)\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![Horizon Discovery Expands Cell-based CRISPR Screening\nServices](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/placeholder.jpg)\n![Horizon Discovery Expands Cell-based CRISPR Screening\nServices](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/horizon-\ndiscovery-expands-cell-based-crispr-screening-services-333025.jpg?v=10653997)\n](/applied-sciences/product-news/horizon-discovery-expands-cell-based-crispr-\nscreening-services-333025) [\n\n**Horizon Discovery Expands Cell-based CRISPR Screening Services**\n\n](/applied-sciences/product-news/horizon-discovery-expands-cell-based-crispr-\nscreening-services-333025) [Product News](/applied-sciences/product-news)\n\nHorizon Discovery has announced the addition of an arrayed CRISPR knockout\nscreening service for primary human B cells to its cell-based screening\nservices.\n\n[READ MORE __](/applied-sciences/product-news/horizon-discovery-expands-cell-\nbased-crispr-screening-services-333025)\n\n* * *\n\n**Like what you just read?

As we welcome 2020, and a new\ndecade, it\u2019s also a good idea for leadership development directors to have a\nvision for the future of their department. We\u2019re in the midst of a Fourth\nIndustrial Revolution, yet over the last decade or more, most of leadership\ndevelopment has remained stagnant. What is trained, how it is trained, and who\nis trained is much the same today as it was 10 or even 20 years ago.\n\nTo be relevant for the next decade, directors of leadership development have\nto embrace transformations in every area of training and executive education.\nOnce only talking points, these five areas hold significant promise as they\nbecome a reality in 2020.\n\n**TREND 1: A Focus on Applying and Sustaining Behaviors**\n\nFor too long leadership development has been approached as a one-and-done\nexperience. Many programs take new managers, push them through an\norganization\u2019s \u201cacademy,\u201d then send them out into the world. These leaders are\nchecked on sporadically, perhaps with a 360 or engagement survey. But little\nattention is paid to sustaining knowledge in the long-term.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nWhat a waste. Most estimates put the global investment in leadership\ndevelopment at [over $300\nbillion](https://trainingindustry.com/wiki/outsourcing/size-of-training-\nindustry/ \"https://trainingindustry.com/wiki/outsourcing/size-of-training-\nindustry/\"). Further, according to _CLO_ \u2019s Business Intelligence Board data,\n94% of learning organizations plan to increase or maintain their current\ninvestment in leadership development.\n\nThe \u201cknowing-doing gap\u201d and Ebbinghaus\u2019s forgetting curve point to the\nseverity of the problem: We quickly forget most of what we learn unless we\nconsistently apply it. If leaders aren\u2019t doing it, they\u2019re going to lose\nanywhere from 40 to 80% of what they encountered in learning and development\nprograms.\n\nLeadership development professionals need to start spending as much time\nhelping people sustain new knowledge and behaviors as they do helping those\nleaders acquire new knowledge and behaviors. Behavioral nudges are moving from\nthe world of social psychology into everyday use by companies, governments,\nand other organizations. This might include nudges:\n\n  * Reminding new managers to review weekly task lists and delegate to team members.\n  * Prompting middle managers to practice inclusion in their meetings. \n  * Encouraging senior executives to schedule time for strategic thinking.\n\nSuccessful leadership development professionals will develop hyper-\npersonalized nudge strategies to deliver the right reminder to the right\nperson at the right time.\n\n**TREND 2: Mobile Learning for Millennial Managers**\n\nWith the average age of the first-time manager being 30, we have entered the\nage of millennial management; nearly[ 30% of Millennials hold managerial-level\nroles](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/5-ways-millennial-managers-are-\nchanging-the-office.html \"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/5-ways-millennial-\nmanagers-are-changing-the-office.html\"). Surveys from a variety of sources\nshow that millennial managers value learning and growth experiences more than\nprevious generations. They are also three times more likely than Baby Boomers\nto take responsibility for their own re-skilling, according to[ Upwork\u2019s\nFuture Workforce Report](https://www.upwork.com/blog/2019/03/millennials-genz-\nfuture-workforce-report/ \"https://www.upwork.com/blog/2019/03/millennials-\ngenz-future-workforce-report/\"). Yet, they want training and development\ndelivered in a new way. They expect mobile access to learning opportunities,\nanytime, anywhere. Leadership development professionals need to tailor\nprograms to this group of managers and offer more flexible online programs.\nAccording to the[ Korn Ferry\nInstitute](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/the-millennial-managers-have-\narrived \"https://www.kornferry.com/institute/the-millennial-managers-have-\narrived\"), research shows Millennials learn more through online development\nthan time spent in the classroom.\n\n**TREND 3: Group Coaching & Democratization of Leadership Development**\n\nTraditionally, senior executives are given executive coaches and development\nvia executive education programs at elite universities along with executive\nseminars and retreats. New managers are typically put through a leadership\ndevelopment academy or boot camp. Middle managers are largely forgotten.\n\nIn this new decade, everyone needs to be a leader who actively engages their\npeople. Awareness of this will see leadership development pushed down through\nthe organization, and coaching will become a standard part of every manager\u2019s\nexperience.\n\nBut how will organizations afford it? One way is to offer group coaching\nexperiences, that utilize one human executive coach for every ten managers. By\nsynchronizing monthly or quarterly topics, one coach can effectively support\neach manager\u2019s needs on a weekly basis, and bring everyone together using\nvideo conferencing on a monthly basis. Additionally, companies can now\nleverage AI-powered coach bots and hyper-personalized nudges from companies\nlike LEADx, Butterfly.ai, Qstream, and others.\n\n**TREND 4: Alignment to the Engagement Survey**\n\nGallup research has shown that 70% of the[ variance in employee\nengagement](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-\nvariance-employee-engagement.aspx\n\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-variance-\nemployee-engagement.aspx\") ties back to the manager. People join a company,\nbut they leave their boss. One reason? What is taught in leadership\ndevelopment academies and included in leadership competency models is often\nvery different than what is measured in employee engagement surveys. Employee\nexperience and employee engagement are hotter than ever before. While most of\nthe emphasis has been on measurement, leadership development professionals\nmust also now realize that changing managerial behaviors is the best way to\nmove the needle on survey outcomes.\n\nIn the book _Knowing-Doing Gap_ , Pfeffer and Sutton use Intuit as an example\nof a firm that uses its[ engagement survey as more than a metric\ngenerator](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-knowing-doing-gap-how-smart-\ncompanies-turn-knowledge-into-action \"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-\nknowing-doing-gap-how-smart-companies-turn-knowledge-into-action\"). \"The\nmeasurement, nothing more than an employee survey, but one that is taken very\nseriously, affords a way of focusing managerial effort on those dimensions of\nthe culture that most need attention at a given moment.\u201d\n\nTo promote employee engagement, the first obvious step is training and\ncoaching managers in how to apply behaviors that unlock emotional commitment.\nEach organization is different but, in general, managers need to learn\nspecific behaviors such as: using a coach approach to develop team members,\ngiving effective timely feedback, providing strategic recognition, building\ntrust, and fostering belonging.\n\n**TREND 5: AI Becomes Invisible**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been hyped for the last several years.\nVendors use the term to get attention and convince us there is some magic in\ntheir solutions. Yet in the new decade, AI will become the norm, an _assumed_\npart of leadership development experiences. We already mentioned the power of\nexecutive coach chatbots answering questions and providing guidance using\nnatural language processing technology. At the same time, AI is going to be\nmaking an impact in personalization. With AI, leaders will be offered hyper-\npersonalized content based on the manager\u2019s personality, competencies, and\nobjectives. As it does for Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify, AI can present\ntargeted information in a learning management or nudge system.\n\nAI is also going to support leadership development directors in gaining the\nrespect of other senior leaders. The cold hard truth is those with the seats\nat the table can talk in numbers. With AI technology, leadership development\ncan increase its use of dashboards and correlation matrices. More telling than\nthe number of workshop participants or the latest smile sheet survey ratings,\nmetrics in 2020 will quantify:\n\n  * How many people are ready to move into leadership\n  * How many people are ready to advance from front line to middle manager\n  * Which training courses correlate to higher engagement scores\n  * Which leadership development experiences correlate to faster promotions \n  * Performance review rankings\n\nLeadership development cultivates the human capital of an organization. As we\nmove into the 2020s, it\u2019s an exciting time for top-to-bottom transformation of\nour departments. Shaped by these five trends, we can move forward with\ndeveloping a clear vision for ongoing success in training and sustaining\nsuccessful leaders.\n\n\u2014\n\n_Kevin Kruse is the CEO of_[ _LEADx_](https://leadx.org/ \"https://leadx.org/\")\n_, a platform that helps leadership development professionals sustain and\nscale their programs with nudges, digital coaching, and micro-learning\nmodules.

Possibilities are,\nyou may face one of the following feedback from your employees when they hear\nthe word, \u2018performance management\u2019:\n\n  * The process creates anxiety and stress\n  * The overall process of performance evaluation is draining and time-taking\n  * It is just a one-way communication\n  * The performance reviews are, more often than not, inaccurate and filled with biases\n\nIn a workplace as dynamic and multigenerational as today, the right approach\nto performance has become enormously important in accelerating growth,\nboosting motivation and engagement and thereby, curbing attrition. In that\nregard, it is critical to shift performance ownership from management to\nemployees for everyone to evolve and put more skin in the game.\n\nHowever, since most Gen X / Gen Y employees have been experiencing performance\nmanagement in a very traditional even conventional kind of way, there are a\nfew quandaries and questions that every organization and employee is bound to\nhave: \u201cWhat do I have to do to own my own performance?\u201d, \u201cHow do I get more\nclarity if my performance is contributing to the larger growth of the org?\u201d,\n\u201cAre my organization\u2019s goals syncing with the needs of the market?\u201d, \u201cWhat am\nI to expect when my organization says \u2018own your performance\u2019?\u201d, \u201cCan ALL\nemployees own their performance?\u201d, \u201cWhat should the focus areas be?\u201d, \u201cWill a\nlot of guidance be required?\u201d, \u201cWill there be a great amount of effort going\ninto change management?\u201d, \u201cApart from the possible increase in financial\nperformance, are there other avenues that will get affected through an\nemployee-owned performance system?\u201d,\u201cAre my managers equipped to handle this\nchange and provide adequate support?\u201d\n\nThe need of the hour is for HR to offer strategies and uncover solutions that\ncan enable organizations to effectively shift ownership of performance to\ntheir employees.\n\n**This is how you can empower employees to take charge of their own\nperformance:**\n\n### Mentor them to craft their own goals:\n\nIdentify your employees\u2019 professional goals and help by offering them a\nframework to establish their short term and long term goals. Let them assess\nhow these goals would benefit them as well as the organization. When employees\nalign their goals with the company, it helps them see whether they fit into\nthe organization or not. It also allows them to understand what they are\nexpected to focus on , and how they will manage their performance to achieve\nthose goals.Additionally, personal goals really need to be driven by the\nemployee. Handing them a list of things that you want them to do will not\ninspire them or make them feel engaged in the process beyond a point. So,\nallow them to identify opportunities and goals which they themselves want to\npursue and that which will help them grow.\n\n### Enable them to initiate performance conversations:\n\nBy default, most performance evaluations focus on correcting past mistakes,\nidentifying skill gaps and calling out personal weaknesses. Often managers are\nbiased toward recent events or continue to emphasize problems long after the\nfact. Hence, most of the time employees dread performance conversations. To\nreally drive a successful performance programme, employees should receive\nmeaningful feedback that is timely, actionable direction, and can play an\ninstrumental role in shaping their performance. One of the ways of achieving\nthis is by empowering employees to initiate and drive their performance\nconversations with their managers and other stakeholders.\n\nTechnologies today incorporate functionalities like monthly or quarterly\ncheck-in, continuous feedback, and 360\u00b0 feedback which allows employees to\ncollect feedback from multiple stakeholders within and even outside the\norganization, to enable a holistic, unbiased and balanced evaluation their\nperformance.\n\n### Have them conduct periodic self-reviews:\n\nEmployees should be asked to conduct a self-review on how they think they are\nliving out the company values before managers and employees sit for official\nend-of-year review. It gives them a chance to reflect on their own personal\ndevelopment and gives managers a chance to assess the employees\u2019 self-\nawareness of their worth and buy-in to company culture, which always has a\ndirect correlation to metric-driven performance.\n\n### Empower them to craft their learning journey:\n\nBy taking charge of their performance management, employees are able to\nvisualize their learning path and, within that road map, adjust their course\nto address their specific weaknesses, strengths, and learning goals.\n\nEncourage employees to have a separate conversation with their managers on\ntheir individual development goals. Those conversations should enable them to\nhave open conversations about what skills they want to acquire, which course\nthey want to do and how managers can support them in pursuing the learning\ngoals.\n\nMaking the performance management system owned by employee may seem like a\nchallenging task at first. However, with an arsenal of technologies available,\nthe process can be made impactful with features like Continuous Feedback,\nCompetency Mapping and Individual Development Plans for both managers and\nemployees. Besides these, there are also other comprehensive features, such as\nGoal Cascading, Succession Planning, Multi-stakeholder Feedback. That not only\nenables better alignment of the employee\u2019s goals with those of the\norganization and leadership, but also enables employees to drive their\nperformance conversation and assessment.\n\nTo know more about creating a new-age employee-led performance management\nprogramme, attend the webinar on [How to slingshot growth by making employee\nthe owner of Performance\nManagement?](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-making-employee-the-\nowner-of-performance-management \"Webinar\") Register yourself\n[here](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-making-employee-the-owner-\nof-performance-management) for the webinar.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management \"Browse\nmore in: Performance Management\"), [#Smarter Work Life](/tag/smarter-work-\nlife?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=smarter-work-life \"Browse more in:\nSmarter Work Life\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Anushree Sharma](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1500295266/authors/anushree-\nsharma.jpg)](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\n#### [Anushree Sharma](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\nAnushree is an Assistant Manager- Content at People Matters.

Umare, PhD](/author/prashant-s-umare-phd)\n\n![lab-\naccreditation](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/978/iImg/1973/226fb29d-e5c5-4b01-8d85-70be973b9b7e-accred.png)\n\nAll laboratories involved in testing and calibration strive to produce valid\nresults for their customers, and it is a significant key performance indicator\n(KPI). [Laboratory\naccreditation](https://www.labmanager.com/tag/accreditation) as per the\nglobally accepted standard, ISO/IEC 17025, \"General Requirements for the\nCompetence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories,\" plays a vital role to\nmeet this KPI. The fundamental objective to develop this standard was to\npromote confidence in the operation of laboratories and contains requirements\nfor laboratories to enable them to demonstrate their competency and generate\nvalid results. Implementation of this standard requirement in laboratories\ndoes not only facilitate the development of a robust structure of a laboratory\nmanagement system (LMS), but also lays down a strong foundation for the\noperational excellence model. As of 2017, standard requirements encompass a\ncomplete supplier-input-process- output-customer (SIPOC) cycle and end-to-end\nlaboratory processes. It is the single most widely employed standard by\ncalibration and testing laboratories throughout the globe to obtain the\naccreditation. This is a generic standard for any laboratory and can be\nimplemented in any laboratory regardless of the nature of testing and number\nof people. It covers testing, calibration, and sampling performed using\nstandard, nonstandard, and laboratory-developed methods and sampling\nassociated with subsequent testing and calibration. Additionally, this\nstandard is being used by various stakeholders in different ways. A laboratory\nuses this standard to develop a LMS, the accreditation body uses it in\nconfirming or recognizing the competence of laboratories, and customers use it\nas a reference to ensure the competency of the laboratory.\n\n## History and transition\n\nThe third edition of the standard was published in November 2017 as ISO/IEC\n17025:2017. Historically, ISO/IEC 17025 was first released in 1999 to replace\nISO Guide 25. The second edition was released in 2005 to include management\nrequirements in line with ISO 9001:2000, which was subsequently reaffirmed in\n2010. A three-year transition period has been given for accredited\nlaboratories to transition to the 2017 version of ISO/IEC 17025. During this\ntransition period, ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 17025:2017 will be equally\nvalid and applicable. At the end of the transition period, accreditation of a\nlaboratory to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 will not be recognized under the\nInternational Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation arrangement. The standard\nis developed by ISO's Committee on Conformity Assessment (CASCO). Primarily,\nin the 2017 version, there are obligatory changes as per the ISO/CASCO\nChairman's Policy and Coordination Group, philosophical changes, structural\nchanges, and the addition of new definitions.\n\nA new definition of laboratory is introduced by virtue of which laboratory\naccreditation scope has been expanded to cover testing and/or calibration\nlaboratories, which are only involved in the sampling associated with\nsubsequent calibration and testing.\n\nThe format of the third edition has been profoundly changed and the current\nversion is similar to the 17000 series standards from CASCO, such as\nISO/IEC:17020 and ISO/IEC:17065, and aligned to the ISO 9001:2015 principles\non resources and processes. The structure of the new standard is as follows:\n\n  1. Scope\n  2. Normative references\n  3. Terms and definitions\n  4. General requirements\n  5. Structural requirements\n  6. Resource requirements\n  7. Process requirements\n  8. Management requirements\n    * Annex A--Metrological Traceability (Informative)\n    * Annex B--Management System (Informative)\n    * Bibliography\n\nThere is a significant shift from prescriptive requirements to performance-\nbased requirements by the introduction of the concept of risk-based thinking.\nIn the new version, more focus is given to the outcomes of processes than\nmerely having policies and procedures. As a result, there is greater\nflexibility, considering its own opportunities and risk to the laboratory than\nthe previous edition in the requirements for processes, procedures, documented\ninformation, and organizational responsibilities.\n\n* * *\n\n### [ **Related Article: Everyone Benefits from Laboratory\nAccreditation**](/everyone-benefits-from-laboratory-accreditation)\n\n* * *\n\nTerms such as \"quality manager,\" \"technical manager,\" and \"quality manual\"\nhave been removed. As per the new requirements, there is no obligation to\nformally appoint a quality manager or technical manager. Additionally, there\nis no explicit requirement to develop a quality manual.\n\nA few terms are replaced with new ones, such as \"accommodation by facility\"\nand \"preventive actions by risk and opportunities.\" In most cases, \"test\nand/or calibration\" is replaced with \"laboratory activities.\"\n\nPurchasing services and supplies and subcontracting is combined and considered\nas an externally provided service. New definitions are added, such as those\nfor laboratory, intra-laboratory comparison, decision rule, and impartiality.\nMost of the nonvalue-added notes from the older version are either removed,\nmoved to an annex, or added to the standard requirement. The new standard has\na stronger focus on information technologies to address the increasing use of\ninformation technology to handle documents and records in the laboratory. The\nnew version clearly acknowledges the use of ISO 9001 as a basis of use for\nconformity to ISO/IEC 17025.\n\nEqual weighting has been given to internal and external processes. Replicate\ntests/calibrations, intralaboratory testing, and blind tests are introduced in\naddition to proficiency testing and inter-laboratory testing. Requirement of a\ndecision rule is added in the newer version, while providing a statement of\nconformity to a specification or standard for the test and/or calibration.\nCustomer focus is emphasized by introducing new requirements under complaints,\nagreement on a decision rule, and approval on externally provided services to\nthe customer.\n\n## Risk-based approach\n\nBasically, \"risk-based approach\" means to evaluate the potential risk as well\nas the opportunities. Risk-based thinking is not a new concept and was\nimplicitly addressed in the 2005 version, whereas in the 2017 version of the\nstandard, it became very prominent and incorporated throughout the standard.\nTherefore, the laboratory should apply risk-based thinking from the conception\nof the LMS and spread it out over the planning, execution, and performance-\nmonitoring phases. In fact, risk-based thinking replaced preventive action,\nwhich had a special clause in the 2005 version. The standard does not require\nany formal method of risk management or a documented risk management\nprocedure; rather, it is expected to be an integral part of all laboratory\nprocesses. Moreover, the standard does not state how to determine and analyze\npotential risks. However, ISO 31000, \"Risk Management Guidelines,\" is a very\nuseful reference for understanding. To address this requirement, the\nlaboratory should identify the risk proactively in the planning phase,\nunderstand the consequences, and implement effective preventive measures to\neliminate or reduce the adverse impact on the laboratory operation. There are\nseveral formal and advanced tools available to identify the risk; however, a\nless formal approach that considers the frequency of occurrence, the severity\nof a situation, and a risk category can be adopted in the laboratory. For\nexample, one of the potential risks to impartiality is financial pressure from\ncustomers to provide results in their favor. In this case, the source of risk\nwould be laboratory personnel involved in testing or decision-making.\nPreventive measures to eliminate or minimize risk can include signing a\nconflict of interest declaration form on a yearly basis to reiterate the\ncommitment to impartiality, evaluating employee background history prior to\nrecruitment, and executing a laboratory ethics policy. The likelihood of\noccurrence can be decided on the historical frequency and severity can be\ndecided on the gravity of adverse impact. A similar approach can be adopted to\nevaluate the potential risk in other contexts related to laboratory operation.\n\n## Process approach to the standard requirements\n\nThe paradigm shift of ISO/ IEC 17025 from the 2005 version to the 2017 version\nis a prescriptive approach to the performance-/ process-based approach. If the\nlaboratory is considered as a process, principle process input would be a\nsample and customer requirements and expected output would be results/reports.\nWhen it is viewed through the SIPOC window, secondary processes could be man,\nmachine, method, environment, or supplier. This approach will facilitate\nstakeholders to understand and interpret the standard requirements to design\nand develop the LMS for seamless implementation and further improvement.\nAdditionally, an amalgamation of process requirements and system requirements\ncan be screened.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is the first change to ISO/ IEC 17025 in 12 years. Though there is a\nsignificant structural change in ISO/IEC 17025:2017 compared to ISO/IEC\n17025:2005, the technical changes are comparatively less in magnitude and the\ncontent of the standard is very similar to the old version. The introduction\nof a risk-based approach and process orientation has shifted the prescriptive\napproach of the standard to the performance-based approach, which brought more\nflexibility in implementation and subsequent improvement. To ensure a smooth\ntransition to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, each laboratory will prepare a transition\nplan compatible with the accreditation body's policy on transition and time\nframe. The laboratory should identify the gaps, revise policies and procedures\nto accommodate new requirements, train laboratory personnel, and approach the\naccreditation body for assessment within a transition period of three years.\nWhile working on the transition to the 2017 version, the laboratory needs to\ncontinue to conform to the 2005 version requirements.\n\nTags:  [Accreditation](/tag/accreditation)[National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology](/tag/nationalinstituteofstandardsandtechnology)[Regulations](/tag/regulations)[standards](/tag/standards)\n\n* * *\n\n### Published In:\n\n[![](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/magazineIssueNo/13/iImg/2105/ai-iot-a-\npowerful-combination-l-t.jpg)](/magazine/issue/ai-iot-a-powerful-\ncombination-14-5)\n\n[June 2019](/magazine/issue/ai-iot-a-powerful-combination-14-5)\n\n### [AI & IOT: A Powerful Combination](/magazine/issue/ai-iot-a-powerful-\ncombination-14-5)\n\nHow two broad technologies are influencing life in the lab\n\n[Volume 14 - Issue 5](/magazine/issue/ai-iot-a-powerful-combination-14-5)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n[![Lab Manager Announces Lab Design Excellence\nAwards](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/21330/aImg/39245/lab-\nmanager-announces-lab-design-excellence-awards-m.jpg)](/lab-design-and-\nfurnishings/lab-manager-announces-lab-design-excellence-awards-21330)\n\n[\n\n### Lab Manager Announces Lab Design Excellence Awards\n\n### Lab Manager Announces Lab Design Excellence Awards\n\n](/lab-design-and-furnishings/lab-manager-announces-lab-design-excellence-\nawards-21330)\n\n[![Curbing Environmental Footprint in Laboratory\nEnvironments](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/22146/aImg/41020/curbing-\nenvironmental-footprint-in-laboratory-environments-m.jpg)](/lab-design-and-\nfurnishings/curbing-environmental-footprint-in-laboratory-environments-22146)\n\n[\n\n### Curbing Environmental Footprint in Laboratory Environments\n\n### Curbing Environmental Footprint in Laboratory Environments\n\n](/lab-design-and-furnishings/curbing-environmental-footprint-in-laboratory-\nenvironments-22146)\n\n[![Designing for a Forensic Crime\nLaboratory](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/630/aImg/40541/thumbnail-\nwebinar-lab-design-m.jpg)](/webinars/designing-for-a-forensic-crime-\nlaboratory-630)\n\n[\n\n### Designing for a Forensic Crime Laboratory\n\n### Designing for a Forensic Crime Laboratory\n\n](/webinars/designing-for-a-forensic-crime-laboratory-630)\n\n[![Everyone Benefits from Laboratory\nAccreditation](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/1804/aImg/38940/everyone-\nbenefits-from-laboratory-accreditation-m.png)](/business-management/everyone-\nbenefits-from-laboratory-accreditation-1804)\n\n[\n\n### Everyone Benefits from Laboratory Accreditation\n\n### Everyone Benefits from Laboratory Accreditation\n\n](/business-management/everyone-benefits-from-laboratory-accreditation-1804)\n\n[![Tips for Assessing Indoor Air Quality in the\nLaboratory](https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/articleNo/21844/aImg/40153/tips-\nfor-assessing-indoor-air-quality-in-the-laboratory-m.jpg)](/lab-health-and-\nsafety/tips-for-assessing-indoor-air-quality-in-the-laboratory-21844)\n\n[\n\n### Tips for Assessing Indoor Air Quality in the Laboratory\n\n### Tips for Assessing Indoor Air Quality in the Laboratory\n\n](/lab-health-and-safety/tips-for-assessing-indoor-air-quality-in-the-\nlaboratory-21844)\n\n[ ](/news/a2la-accredits-keystone-state-testing-llc-dba-dakota-state-testing-\nto-iso-iec-17025-2131)\n\n[\n\n### A2LA Accredits Keystone State Testing LLC DBA Dakota State Testing to\nISO/IEC 17025\n\n### A2LA Accredits Keystone State Testing LLC DBA Dakota State Testing to\nISO/IEC 17025\n\n](/news/a2la-accredits-keystone-state-testing-llc-dba-dakota-state-testing-to-\niso-iec-17025-2131)\n\n[ ](https://www.facebook.com/labmanager \"Facebook\")[\n](https://twitter.com/LabManager \"Twitter\")[\n](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lab-manager-magazine/ \"LinkedIn\")[\n](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMe4Je-Qm-La3LUVk5OwuNw/featured\n\"YouTube\")[ ](https://vimeo.com/labmanager \"Vimeo\")\n\n* [About Us](/about-us)\n* [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n* [Advertising](/advertising)\n* [Newsletters](https://subscribe.labmanager.com/newsletter-subscription-form)\n* [Vendor List](/vendors)\n\nNow part of the LabX Media Group: [LabX Media\nGroup](http://www.labxmediagroup.com/) |  [Clinical Lab\nManager](http://www.clinicallabmanager.com) |  [Privacy](/privacy-policy/) |\n[Terms](/terms-of-use/)\n\n(C) 2020 Lab Manager.

The report comes at a time when the country is grappling with issues\nof curriculum review and the reform process, teacher training and recruitment,\nthe formulation and implementation of a national education policy and the\nimplementation of CBC. The research, conducted by KNUT, looked into issues of\nteacher preparedness, the availability and adequacy of teaching materials, the\nlevel of engagement between teachers and parents, as well as the challenges\nfaced by head teachers and teaching staff in implementing CBC.\n\nKNUT concludes that the implementation of CBC has been hurriedly undertaken\nwhile the majority of teachers have not been sufficiently trained in CBC\ncontent and teaching methods. It adds that most pre-primary teachers, as well\nas those for grades one to three have not received any training whatsoever\nwhile those that did attend training workshops were inadequately trained by\ntrainers and facilitators who were themselves incompetent in the delivery of\nthe CBC approach.\n\nThe research also found that the training sessions were poorly conducted and\nthat their effectiveness fell well below expectations, hindering the ability\nof teachers to design, assess, and evaluate the delivery of lessons and\nlearners\u2019 outcomes. The report also notes that the resources and\ninfrastructure required for learning, assessment and capacity-building in the\nCBC approach\u2014which are completely different from those in use in the current\nsystem\u2014are non-existent or inadequate at best. Parents and other stakeholders\nhave not been involved in the reform process nor have public awareness\ncampaigns been conducted following the roll-out of CBC.\n\n#### **The CBC system and design**\n\nFormal education was introduced in Kenya during the British colonial era and\nbetween 1964 and 1985 the education cycle comprised seven years of primary\nschool, four years of secondary school, two years of high school, and three\nyears of university education. The 8-4-4 system of education\u2014eight years of\nprimary school, four years of secondary school and four years of university\neducation\u2014was introduced in January 1985 to address concerns that the basic\neducation previously provided lacked the necessary content to promote\nwidespread sustainable self-employment.\n\nThe Kenyan primary school curriculum is approved for all public schools and\nmost private schools\u2014with the exception of international schools, which\nusually offer the British or American curriculum. The subjects studied at the\nprimary level are English, Kiswahili, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies,\nReligious Education, Creative Arts, Physical Education and Life Skills. Pupils\ntake a national examination at the end of the primary cycle with the results\nof the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) determining placement in\nsecondary school.\n\nIn a major departure from the 8-4-4 system, the proposed CBC system was\nlaunched in 2017 and is designed to comprise two years of pre-primary\neducation, six years of primary education, three years of junior secondary\neducation, three years of senior secondary education and three years of\nuniversity.\n\nThe Kenyan CBC is designed with the objective that at the end of each learning\ncycle every learner will be competent in the following seven core competency\nareas: communication and collaboration; critical thinking and problem-solving;\nimagination and creativity; citizenship; learning to learn; self-efficacy; and\ndigital literacy.\n\nCBC places emphasis on competence development rather than on the acquisition\nof content knowledge. This effectively means that the teaching and learning\nprocess has to change its orientation from rote memorisation of content to the\nacquisition of skills and competencies useful for solving real-life problems.\nTeaching methods include role-play, problem-solving, projects, case studies,\nand study visits, among other learner-centred strategies, and the teacher is\nexpected to switch from the role of an expert to that of a facilitator who\nguides the learning process. Learners are expected to take responsibility for\ntheir own learning through direct exploration and experience while their\nteachers are expected to design effective learning activities geared towards\nthe development of specific competencies.\n\nMoreover, the revised curriculum requires teachers to frequently assess their\nstudents using assessment methods, such as portfolios, classroom or field\nobservation, projects, oral presentations, self-assessments, interviews and\npeer assessments. Teachers are also required to change from a norm-referenced\nto a criterion-referenced judgment of learners\u2019 capabilities or competencies\nto determine their progress. Finally, teachers are supposed to provide\ncontinuous, timely and constructive feedback to inform their students about\nthe strengths and weaknesses of their performance since instruction and\nlearning are reviewed and modified based on the feedback.\n\n> CBC places emphasis on competence development rather than on the acquisition\n> of content knowledge. This effectively means that the teaching and learning\n> process has to change its orientation from rote memorisation of content to\n> the acquisition of skills and competencies useful for solving real-life\n> problems.\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that the introduction of CBC in Kenyan schools calls\nfor a comprehensive change in the instructional approach in terms of teaching,\nlearning and assessment, and this requires changes in teacher training\nprogrammes in order to equip teachers (both pre-service and in-service) with\nthe competencies that will enable them to effectively handle the challenges\nassociated with CBC implementation in schools.\n\nHowever, Kenya initiated the implementation of the Competency-Based Curriculum\nin 2017 in the absence of any research-based evidence on the effectiveness of\nthe new system. Despite the challenges and shortcomings identified by the\ninternal and external evaluations of the pilot study on CBC implementation,\nthe government went ahead with the national roll-out of CBC in January 2019.\n\nPrior to its adoption and roll-out, no comprehensive survey of international\nbest practices was conducted and nor was there any research to support the\nargument that the CBC framework is more effective than the current learning\noutcomes-based curriculum framework. The needs assessment was not properly\nconducted. The summative evaluation, which was conducted in 2009, cannot be\nthe basis for reforming the curriculum in 2018. The entire process was\ndominated by foreign consultants with no experience in curriculum reform in\nKenya. The involvement of teachers, university lecturers, and prominent local\nexperts was minimal.\n\nMoreover, an illegality was committed at the time of rolling out CBC for pre-\nprimary and Standards One to Three as there was no Sessional Paper to guide\nthe process and, furthermore, no review of the existing education system had\nbeen undertaken by an Education Commission prior to the roll-out. Pilot\ntesting of the curriculum was hurriedly done over a few short months and\nwithout appropriate syllabus or pupils\u2019 books and teachers\u2019 guides.\n\nIt must also be pointed out that the introduction of technical and vocational\ncourses in the school curriculum is a serious mistake as the purpose of basic\neducation is not to train students but to make them trainable. Empirical\nstudies show that **c** ompetency-based models are mainly applicable to\nvocational education and training due to the emphasis placed on standards of\ncompetence in occupational sectors. Competence is the possession and\ndemonstration of knowledge, understanding, skills, attitudes and behaviour\nrequired to perform a given task to a described standard. The concept is\ntherefore more useful in vocational education since the emphasis is on the\nability of the student to perform a set of related tasks with a high degree of\nskills, and a particular competency can be broken down into its component\nparts through task analysis.\n\n> Prior to its adoption and roll-out, no comprehensive survey of international\n> best practices was conducted and nor was there any research to support the\n> argument that the CBC framework is more effective than the current learning\n> outcomes-based curriculum framework.\n\nThe adoption of CBC in Kenya\u2014as in some other African countries, such as\nBotswana, Senegal and South Africa\u2014may be explained in part by the current\ntendency of some international agencies to favour such pedagogies. In most of\nthe countries concerned, however, attempts to institutionalise child-centred\npedagogy in schools and teacher-training institutions have been inconclusive\nand, indeed, no country in the world has successfully implemented CBC. It is\ntherefore a disturbing development that the member countries of the East\nAfrican Community have\u2014according to Sessional Paper No. 14 of 2012\u2014adopted a\ncommon policy of harmonising education systems and training curricula that\nwill shift focus from the standard curriculum design to the CBC and assessment\napproach.\n\nTanzania introduced CBC in secondary schools in 2005 and in primary education\nin 2006. Back in 2001 the Ministry of Education and Culture had asked for\neducation to be treated as a strategic agent in the creation of a well-\neducated nation. The ministry anticipated developing an education system that\nwould enable Tanzanians to be sufficiently equipped with the knowledge needed\nto competently and competitively solve the development challenges facing the\nnation.\n\nHowever, a 2012 study on the implementation of the competency-based teaching\nin schools in Tanzania established that CBC had not been well implemented and\nmore efforts needed to be devoted to the development of tutors\u2019 and\nprincipals\u2019 understanding of the CBC approach. Other studies conducted to\nassess CBC implementation in Tanzania have confirmed that there is very\nminimal use of the CBC teaching approach in schools and that more than 80 per\ncent of the teachers lack a proper understanding of the approach and continue\nto use traditional knowledge-based teaching and learning methods, with\nassessment methods remaining the same as those used in assessing knowledge-\nbased teaching and learning, while the teaching approach continues to be\nteacher-centred.\n\n#### **Hidden agendas**\n\nThe role of education in the development process cannot be over-emphasised.\nThere is substantial empirical evidence of the crucial role of education in\npoverty reduction, human development, job prospects for individuals and the\nbroader social-economic development of nations. In other words, education\nplays a key role in the transformation of societies. Unfortunately, the impact\nof education in sub-Saharan African countries has been minimised because\nAfrican countries have often been put under pressure to adopt unrealistic\nreforms by a small number of nameless and faceless experts working in\ninternational organisations, such as the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the United Nations Population\nFund (UNFPA), the United Nations International Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, who have a hidden\nagenda and normally exert their influence indirectly from behind the scenes.\n\nCurriculum reform is necessary if we want to improve the quality of education\nin Kenya. However, curriculum reform should be based on the needs of learners\nand society and on best international practices and standards. It is an\norderly, planned sequence in which curriculum specialists, teachers,\nuniversity lecturers who have undertaken advanced academic studies in\ncurriculum development and other local education experts\u2014including the\nMinistry of Education professional staff who have extensive experience in\ncurriculum development, implementation and evaluation\u2014assist in conducting a\nneeds assessment identifying a problem, finding a solution, conceptualising\nthe required curriculum, planning and designing a reformed curriculum, pilot-\ntesting the revised curriculum on a small scale, then implementing it\nnationally.\n\nUnfortunately, the views of the Ministry of Education and the team of local\nconsultants and foreign experts have tended to dominate decisions about the\nongoing curriculum reform process. The prominent role of UNICEF\u2014and not\nUNESCO\u2014in the reform process raises fundamental questions about the agenda of\nthe donor.\n\nCurriculum reform is an improvement or change of the curriculum for the\nbetter. It involves the development and utilisation of the curriculum in new\nand unique ways that will enhance the attainment of higher levels of\nachievement for students. Curriculum reform is mainly concerned with changes\nin the content and organisation of what is taught. Many people and\norganisations, including teachers\u2019 unions, professional bodies, religious\norganisations, students, teachers, curriculum specialists, quality assurance\nand standards officers, educational administrators and community leaders\nconcerned with matters of education often seek to bring reforms to the school\ncurriculum.\n\n> Curriculum reform is necessary if we want to improve the quality of\n> education in Kenya. However, curriculum reform should be based on the needs\n> of learners and society and on best international practices and standards.\n\nIn most African countries\u2014and Kenya is no exception\u2014curriculum developers are\nthe gatekeepers who critically assess the different proposals for curriculum\nreform and make recommendations for the changes to be made to subject panels\nand academic boards. The authority for the decision to change the curriculum\nrests with the Academic Boards of Curriculum Development. Many educators,\nincluding those from Kenya, are now rejecting the externally-driven approach\nto education reform. They propose instead an interactive and participatory\napproach which involves\u2014and begins with\u2014an evaluation by classroom teachers\nand district education personnel. This ensures that the views of the people\nclosest to the process of teaching and learning are taken into account.\n\nBased on the findings of the research conducted by KNUT, it is fair to\nconclude that the implementation of CBC has not lived up to the aim of\ntransforming education in Kenya. Collective efforts are, therefore, needed to\nsave Kenya\u2019s education system not only from vested business interests and\nlocal cartels, but also from international agencies and non-governmental\norganisations with hidden agendas. The Ministry of Education should commission\nhighly educated and experienced curriculum developers and evaluators to\nproduce a high-quality curriculum which is relevant to the Kenyan child and to\nthe needs of the country.\n\n![Avatar](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/03/TheElephantLogo-80x80.png)\n\nBy [Special Correspondent](https://www.theelephant.info/author/scorrespondent/\n\"Posts by Special Correspondent\")\n\nLove our content?

We commend the government for the efforts it\nhas made to limit the contagion. In particular, we commend health service\npersonnel for their tireless round-the-clock monitoring, testing and treatment\nof those affected by the disease.\n\nI appreciate the 300 water points rolled out by the National Water and\nSewerage Corporation and Kampala Capital City Authority on Friday 27 March.\nNWSC must be funded to enable them to continue to offer handwashing points in\nurban areas.\n\nIt is heartening to observe the positive public response to the Ministry of\nHealth guidance and directives. I join the President of Uganda in emphasising\nthat the contagion can only be stopped if we collectively practice physical\ndistancing, frequent handwashing and avoiding touching our faces. These are\nthe only preventive measures possible. There is no cure available so far.\n\nThe Director of the World Health Organisation, which is at the forefront of\nthe fight against the pandemic, has described lockdowns as \u201cextreme social &\neconomic restrictions\u201d.\n\nIn Uganda, our first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected on 21 March 2020.\nAs of Friday 3 April, Uganda had 48 confirmed cases. It is not easy for public\nservants and it is not easy for the ordinary citizen, but if we continue to\ncooperate, the pandemic will end. Uganda is among the countries with fewer\nthan 100 cases and we stand a good chance of overcoming this crisis if we make\nthe right policy choices now.\n\nWe agree with the WHO that the lockdown provides a window of opportunity to\ncurb and finally defeat the disease but also to prevent a resurgence of\ninfections once the lockdown is lifted. We believe it is necessary to \u201cRefocus\nthe whole of government on suppressing and controlling Covid19\u201d, as Dr Tedros\nGhebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, has advised.\n\n> The World Health Organisation, which is at the forefront of the fight\n> against the pandemic, has described lockdowns as \u201cextreme social & economic\n> restrictions\u201d\n\nWe agree that \u201con their own, these measures will not extinguish epidemics\u201d. We\nadopt the recommendation that, to be effective, the lockdown _must_ be\naccompanied by measures aimed at strengthening the health service. It is our\nview that Uganda\u2019s response to this pandemic can lay the foundations for a\nhealthier and better-prepared country.\n\nIn everything we do, we must prioritise the safety of the health workers at\nthe frontline. We therefore propose that they are provided with daily\ntransport, risk and other duty-facilitating allowances, as well as personal\nprotective equipment (PPE). In his address to the nation on 31 March, the\nPresident reported that health workers in upcountry facilities are avoiding\nsuspected COVID-19 cases because they lack protective gear. This is\nunfortunate and must be addressed immediately at all Regional Referral\nHospitals. It was shocking to hear in the Presidential Address on Friday 3\nMarch that Uganda only has 10 per cent of the PPE required at this time.\n\nWe also support the call by some members of Parliament to pay health workers a\nmotivational allowance, on time and during this crisis, not in arrears.\n\nIt may not be possible in the short term to expand, train and deploy our\nhealthcare and public health workforce as recommended but the recruitment\nprocess can begin. The news that hundreds of healthcare workers are being\nrecruited at all levels is welcome. Hopefully, the majority are clinicians and\nnurses.\n\nWhat _is_ possible in Uganda in the short-term is to continue efforts to\n\u201cfind, isolate, test, treat and trace\u201d those who may have been exposed to the\nvirus and who together with their families are at risk. Of the 48 cases,\nnearly all were incoming travellers and contacts of travellers arriving mostly\nfrom Dubai, 15 from the United Kingdom, three from the United States, one from\nKenya. By 28 March, only three confirmed cases were not incoming travellers.\nWe wish them all an easy recovery.\n\n> Uganda is among the countries with fewer than 100 cases and we stand a good\n> chance of overcoming this crisis if we make the right policy choices now\n\nIn the two weeks prior to the airport closure, 2,661 high-risk travellers\nentered the country. Also, there are others that had not been identified\nbefore Dubai emerged as a high-risk country. Less than 1,000 of these people\nhave been quarantined and tested. It would help to offer amnesty to the\nhundreds remaining to encourage them to come forward. The security services\nneed only be deployed if there is further failure to cooperate after the\namnesty is announced. In any event, the forces should endeavour to treat\ncitizens with the respect they deserve. Wanton violence of the type we have\nseen contributes nothing to disease control and undermines faith in the\ngovernment to lead us out of this crisis.\n\nAs has been noted, the more tests done, the greater the number of positive\ndiagnoses. While we appreciate the donation of testing equipment from the WHO\nand Jack Ma, we note that we remain vulnerable as long as our capacity to test\ndepends on donations. We recommend that Uganda seeks short-term measures to\nfind funds for test kits. The public needs to be informed whether all the\ntests being used are WHO-approved. There is some concern about the potential\nfor false negative results and, being a \u201cfragile State\u201d that is receiving\nmultiple donations, we need assurance that all equipment is up to par.\n\nRegional Referral Hospitals, and Naggulu and Mulago Specialised Hospitals,\nhave been tasked with the management of COVID-19 cases. The input of the\nUganda Medical Association, whose members are at the frontline of this battle,\nis required in signing off those entities equipped to take on the task. This\nwill ensure healthcare workers at those designated facilities have adequate\nequipment, drugs and PPE. It is hoped that funds will be made available to\nprovide testing facilities in hospitals outside Entebbe.\n\n> Wanton violence of the type we have seen contributes nothing to disease\n> control and undermines faith in the government to lead us out of this crisis\n\nBiosafety professionals should be involved in setting up any quarantine sites\noutside hospital settings to avoid healthcare-associated infections after the\npandemic passes. The same should apply to General Hospitals and all Health\nCentre IVs if the need arises. Regional quarantine and treatment centres are\nneeded to ensure everyone has a good chance of survival wherever in the\ncountry they may live as transporting patients across the country puts health\nworkers at risk. Moreover, disinfection of markets, taxi parks and, where\npossible, other public places should take place before the lockdown is lifted.\n\n#### **Funding the fight**\n\nTo fund the interventions we request that money currently allocated to\nMinistries, Departments and Agencies for non-essential activities be\nreallocated to increasing the number of tests carried out per day and\nproviding transport and PPE for health workers. For example, fuel expenditure\nsaved by grounding government vehicles and cancelling bench-marking trips,\nconferences, and treatment abroad for ailments that are treatable in Uganda,\nshould also be reallocated to the health sector. Above all, we should minimise\nwaste; expenditure on advertising in the media, printing official bulletins\nand so on, is not a priority. As WHO recommends, the way forward is \"find,\nisolate, test, treat & trace\".\n\nMost challenging, however, is the third recommendation from WHO: \u201cExpand,\ntrain & deploy your health care & public health workforce\u201d. Currently, we have\nfive hospital beds per 10,000 people, 200 intensive care units and less than\none (0.9) doctor per 10,000 people. To further complicate matters, other\naffected countries will seek to import our doctors to combat COVID-19 in their\ncountries. The United States has already invited work visa applications from\ndoctors. The US has 25.9 doctors per 100,000 people but 300,000 COVID-19\ncases. Robust interventions on our part will serve in the current crisis and\nduring any future health crises.\n\n> As WHO recommends, the way forward is \"find, isolate, test, treat & trace\"\n\nThe immediate sizeable source of funds would be the suspension of the Lubowa\nSpecialised Hospital Project targeting health tourists. The total project cost\nis Sh1.4 trillion ($379 million). After the first payment of Sh327 billion\n($87million), there remains a balance of Sh139 billion. These funds are needed\nto provide primary healthcare, intensive care and emergency care for Ugandans.\n(The existing budget for the 41 hospitals to be built in 39 districts is Sh1.3\ntrillion.) The reallocation from Lubowa Hospital should take place as soon as\npossible and should the lender decline, the rest of the loan should be\ncancelled.\n\n#### **Easing the Economic Impact of COVID-19**\n\nThe majority of Ugandans are employed in the informal sector. In fact, 83 per\ncent of non-agricultural workers are in the informal sector (World Bank\nDatabank). The majority of workers (75.2 per cent) are classified as being in\n\u201cvulnerable employment\u201d ( _Human Development Report 2019, UNDP_ ). What this\nmeans is they do not have health insurance and are unlikely to have savings or\nany other form of social safety net. For the fishermen and small traders who\npay annual licence fees, Uganda Revenue Authority could consider extending the\nvalidity of those licences to take account of trade lost during the pandemic.\n\nBorrowers from the Youth Livelihood Programme and the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship\nProgramme present a problem. The 83,000 participants in the government-funded\nloan schemes such as the Youth Livelihood Programme were already having\ndifficulties making repayments and the majority defaulted. During this time we\nrequest that the government suspends the pursuing of defaulters and resumes\ncollections when normal work resumes.\n\nThose in debt to micro-finance companies can be assisted by freezing interest\naccumulation during the lockdown and extending repayment periods once work\nresumes. Boda boda riders who have bought their motorcycles on credit fall\ninto this category.\n\nFormal Small and Medium Enterprises face similar loan repayment challenges and\nrequire similar consideration. The Bank of Uganda has the responsibility to\nuse those mechanisms as are within in its powers to maintain economic\nstability. It should ensure that SMEs are not forced out of business by\nenabling banks to extend repayment periods for loans. In this connection,\nborrowers forced to default should not be penalised and listed by the Credit\nRating Bureau.\n\nBoth the formal and informal sectors increasingly use digital means to do\nbusiness. To reduce the use of potentially infectious money, and to make\ntransactions more affordable, we request that the government lift the OTT tax\n(excise duty on over-the-top services). The government is also urged to reach\nan agreement with Telcos to further reduce their rates for all telephony.\n\n#### **Mortgages and rent**\n\nWithout work, the informal sector and struggling SME owners may be unable to\npay rent and may face eviction. Bear in mind landlords too may rely on the\nrent to repay building loans and cater for their families. Therefore, for\nthose in the informal sector we request that the government works out an\narrangement with landlords to grant a month\u2019s grace period for those forced to\ndefault on rent. The government could take on the debt for the period of the\nlockdown. For those in the formal sector, the government should consider\nguaranteeing the rent and mortgage payments and later recover them from salary\nor from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) savings of the tenant.\nMoreover, the NSSF Act needs to be amended to give members access to their\nsavings during emergencies in future.\n\n#### **Utilities**\n\nPayment of electricity and water bills will become more difficult in the days\nahead. The National Water and Sewerage Corporation has explained that it is\nunable to waive water charges because it too must meet its obligations to\nemployees and suppliers.\n\nWhat is needed are subsidies for consumers in difficulty. Two options are\npossible for a fixed period: a VAT waiver on water and electricity or\nselective subsidies through Yaka credits and water credits for those most in\nneed. It should be possible to apply online or to regional offices and be\ngranted these credits according to criteria agreed upon between the government\nand the utilities providers.\n\n#### **Social protection of the most vulnerable**\n\nWe note the relief being distributed to the vulnerable in Kampala and Wakiso\ndistricts. It is true that many urban dwellers have been suddenly deprived of\nincomes and require support. However, rural people in vulnerable employment\nare also affected by the lockdown through loss of income. Many depend on\nroadside markets between towns and cities, traffic which no longer exists.\n\n![](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img1.jpg)The\nelderly are the most vulnerable because globally fatalities have been most\nprevalent among this demographic and also because their caregivers will be\nunable to provide for them as before. Yet many of the elderly are themselves\ncaregivers to grandchildren and employers of farm workers. The government has\nalready compiled a list of the aged to which it pays a monthly grant. This\nSenior Citizens\u2019 Grant is vital in keeping the rural economy afloat and for\nchildren being cared for during this time and therefore it must be paid in\nfull and in a timely manner.\n\nThe incapacitated and those whose caregivers are themselves incapacitated by\nillness will need to be added to the list of the vulnerable as will the\nunemployed who will lose caregiver support. Nearly all Ugandans are at risk of\nfinancial disaster if they were to become seriously ill. The Human Development\nReport states that 75 per cent of Ugandans are at risk of catastrophic\nexpenditure \u2013 expenditure which wipes them out financially \u2013 were they to\nrequire surgery. COVID-19 may not require surgery but in the worst cases\n(should they appear) it will require intensive care. With a reported 200 ICU\nbeds nationally and most probably all occupied, the situation is dire.\n\n![](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img2.jpg)In the\nabsence of public transport, a special public transportation plan for patients\nand expectant mothers travelling to hospitals and medical centres should be\nput in place. The beginnings have been difficult as travel passes have not\nbeen easy to obtain. We propose hiring and branding vehicles for delivering\nCOVID-19 patients to health facilities. The modalities can be worked out by\nthe Joint Task Force. People Power Co-ordinators will be available to assist\nin locating those who require transport to health facilities.\n\nThe 21 per cent of people living in poverty forms a large part of the\nvulnerable section of the population. Undernourishment (caloric intake below\nminimum energy requirements) has been steadily rising for the last 14 years,\nfrom 29 per cent to 41 per cent. We have been advised by the Ministry of\nHealth that people have a better chance of surviving COVID-19 infection if\nthey are adequately nourished. To exclude them from the lockdown-affected\npersons requiring assistance is unfair and counter-productive as they are more\nlikely to succumb to infection.\n\n#### **Disaster preparedness**\n\nWe cannot afford _not_ to be prepared for other disasters. The shortage in\nmedical masks, respirators, gowns and goggles caught Uganda unprepared yet\nthis was forecast by the World Health Organisation on 27 February.\n\nA resurgence of the desert locust plague in the region was forecast to begin\nin early May. A swarm entered Amudat district for the second time on 3 April.\nIf it grows, there will be food shortages.\n\nExtreme climate events such as mudslides this rainy season cannot be ruled out\neither. Our preparedness should reflect the seriousness of the situation and\nfunds set aside to deal with any eventualities. A government statutory\ncontingency fund must be put in place with immediate effect.\n\nOn an individual level, to increase food security, owners of uncultivated land\nare requested to either plant staple foods or allow food to be planted on\ntheir land during this rainy season. This arrangement would be limited to this\nseason that is coinciding with the lockdown period.\n\n#### **Funding the safety net**\n\nTo fund the social safety net, it will be necessary for the government itself\nto get debt relief on the national debt. Currently over 65 per cent of\nrevenues goes towards debt payment. While we appreciate the World Bank\u2019s call\nfor suspension of debt repayments to development partners and offer of a loan\npackage to finance the campaign against COVID-19, this is not a time to\nacquire more debt. Lenders are aware that Uganda is a fragile state and,\ntherefore, negotiations for debt cancellation to enable us to provide a social\nsafety net must go ahead and they must succeed. The absence of a social safety\nnet is the direct result of ill-advised development policies.\n\n#### **Long-term interventions: Rehabilitation of the Health Care System**\n\nPeople Power has long argued that the stagnation in health and other services\nmust be addressed as a matter of urgency, not in 2022 or in 2026 but now. This\npandemic will end but without strong health and other public services, we\nshall remain vulnerable to the next epidemic, pandemic or extreme climate\nevent. So we would like all interventions to go beyond the COVID-19 pandemic\nto cater for future needs.\n\nThe health, water and sanitation and all other sectors must be transformed\ninto robust, life-enhancing government services.\n\n#### **Health expenditure**\n\nOur expenditure on health decreases nearly every year. That trend must be\nreversed. We must go from spending 6 per cent of GDP on the health service to\nspending the 15 per cent we signed up to in the Abuja Declaration.\n\n![](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/img4.jpg)![](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/img3.jpg)Not surprisingly, a review of the hospitals\naround the country reveals that the majority have faulty equipment. To finance\na health service that meets national requirements, the health insurance scheme\nthat has been in the pipeline for over a decade needs to be rolled out.\n\n> We must go from spending 6 per cent of GDP on the health service to spending\n> the 15 per cent we signed up to in the Abuja Declaration.\n\nWe need to develop the capacity to manufacture items for clinical use, e.g.\nprotective gear for health workers. We have the capacity. In 2019 young\nUgandans developed life-saving and cost-saving bio-medical equipment. All are\nimportant because of the nationwide shortage of medical equipment especially\nin rural areas. Olivia Koburongo and Brian Turyabagye developed the Mama-Ope\nsmart jacket for digital pneumonia diagnosis. In 2018 Phyllis Kyomuhendo\ninvented M-Scan a portable ante-natal ultrasound device. Brian Gitta and\ncolleagues developed a bloodless malaria test (Winner of the Africa Prize for\nEngineering Innovation, founded by the Royal Academy of Engineering in the\nUK); we often cannot afford reagents used to test blood. In 2014 Dr Chris\nNsamba developed an incubator for premature babies which he donated to the\ngovernment. It is in use at Mukono Health Centre IV whereby last year it had\nsaved the lives of 243 critically ill babies. Uganda has one of the highest\nrates of premature deaths in the world.\n\n> In 2019 young Ugandans developed life-saving and cost-saving bio-medical\n> equipment\n\nHowever, Dr Nsamba failed to get any government funding although a government\nagency later claimed to have sponsored the development. The government should\nmake a firm commitment to support local innovators by buying their products\nwhile following procurement rules to give all innovators a competitive chance.\n\n#### **Water and Sanitation**\n\nOnly 18 per cent of the population has access to basic sanitation services\nwith which to keep themselves and their homes healthy. Of every 100,000\ndeaths, 31 are related to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene\nservices. Of every 100,000 deaths, 159 are caused by household and air\npollution ( _Human Development Report 2019, UNDP_ ).\n\nIn the long term, there needs to be an investment in the water sector that\nmeets the needs of the 82 per cent without access to basic sanitation\nservices.\n\nWe are grateful for the government\u2019s transparency in admitting that the\nlimited water supply to homes has been caused by \u201cpoor planning and\nimplementation of programmes over the years\u201d. As a result, the water and\nenvironment sector now needs at least nine times the present level of funding\nevery year for the next 12 years to meet national development targets (\n_Budget Monitoring and Accountability Unit Briefing Paper 30/19, Ministry of\nFinance, June 2019_ ).\n\n#### **Environment**\n\n![](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img5.jpg)During\nthe lockdown many will struggle to get fuel for cooking. Under normal\ncircumstances, less than 1 per cent of Ugandans has access to clean fuels and\ntechnologies for cooking. Apart from being unsustainable environmentally, the\ndaily search for firewood, like the daily trip for water, takes away time\nchildren would otherwise have spent in school, acquiring skills to innovate\nfor our survival as a people.\n\n#### **Human Development**\n\nWe have an opportunity to reflect on the type of nation we want to be. Are we\nwilling to invest in our human development and well-being or will we forever\nbelong to WHO\u2019s category of \u201cthe most fragile and vulnerable countries\u201d?\n\nHuman development costs money. We will only see a change if we manage our\nresources better, this goes both to government and to the population. We must\neliminate non-essential expenditure; expenditure on salaries of political\nappointees and on electioneering \u2013 cash handouts in return for votes. We must\neradicate waste; last year vehicles were bought at a cost of $5.5 million for\nthe Commonwealth Parliamentarians Conference. It was said that they would\nthereafter be used for government work but they have not been surrendered to\nthe pool for use in fighting COVID-19. The recent budget proposals for the\ndesert locust emergency, especially by the ICT ministry, show that we have not\nlearned this yet.\n\nAs a Nation, we need to reflect on the wisdom of splintering the country into\ntiny entities paying salaries for MPs, and public service but remaining\nfinancially unable to maintain decent health centres, hospitals or roads, or\nto deliver quality education in most local government institutions.\n\nAs individuals, each one of us must have as much integrity as we expect from\nour leaders. In the last four years, Uganda lost Sh28 billion in the Youth\nLivelihood Programme. An audit of a sampling of Youth Livelihood Project\ngroups which received loans found that 64 per cent were non-existent\n(representing 71 per cent of the value of the loans). Another 25 per cent had\nembezzled the funds. This means that repayments were not available for re-\nlending to new Youth Interest Groups.\n\nWe must never again be found without sufficient medical facilities. We must\nnever again find ourselves lacking water with which to wash our hands and\nprevent disease.\n\nThe physical environment in which we live and work can and must be\ntransformed. Unsanitary working conditions in markets and other public places\nmust be addressed beginning with the NWSC/KCCA handwashing points which we\nexpect will become a permanent feature.\n\n> We must never again find ourselves lacking water with which to wash our\n> hands and prevent disease.\n\nA durable solution to the broken public transport system is needed, especially\nin cities and towns. This pandemic has taught us that public transport is a\npublic good that must be supplied, regulated, maintained and sanitised by the\ngovernment. Supplementary systems are well and good, but the primary\nresponsibility for public transport lies with the government.\n\nOn behalf of the millions of People Power foot soldiers across the country, I\ncall upon the government of Uganda and all Ugandans to reflect and consider\nthe proposals I have laid out here.\n\nFor God and My Country.\n\n[Continue\nReading](https://www.theelephant.info/features/2020/04/06/covid-19-uganda-\nmust-take-robust-measures-to-defeat-the-coronavirus-pandemic/)\n\n### [Politics](https://www.theelephant.info/./features/)\n\n# Harsh Economic Times, Political Uncertainty\u2026and Now Corona\n\nKenyans were already struggling with tough economic conditions and political\ntensions when COVID-19 appeared.

The\nrevelation that the dreaded coronavirus had, about two weeks ago, finally\nfound its way into Kenya threw the country into a state of pandemonium. Until\nthen, Kenyans viewed the virus as a devastating but \u201calien\u201d disease.\n\nIt was not until the quasi-lockdown was ordered by the government that Kenyans\nrealised that beyond the confusion and panic, a much worse situation was\nthreatening to compound and exacerbate an economic meltdown they have been\nexperiencing for the last 20 months or so. The \u201calien\u201d ailment has not only\nbrought with it bewilderment, but is threatening to lock them down, literally,\nto starvation.\n\nThe virus, of the genus corona, was first detected in Wuhan Province in China\nin December 2019, hence the name COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019). Three\nmonths later, when Kenyans first heard about a disease that was killing the\nChinese quicker than flickering fireflies, they brushed it off as one of those\nphenomena that occur in far-off countries in the East.\n\nThe disease could not have come at a worse time for Kenyans. Experiencing\nharsh economic times and political uncertainty, many Kenyans concluded that\nthe gods have conspired to punish them. \u201cFor how else do you explain the\ndisease coming to Kenya at a time when we are faced with the toughest of\neconomic hard times?\u201d posed a woman.\n\n#### **That plane from China**\n\n\u201cThis is the modern Armageddon, the end of times is nigh because we\u2019ve\ndeviated from God\u2019s ways. It is a message from God who is angry with us. We\u2019ve\nsinned too much and this is a sign from God who is asking us to turn from our\nwicked ways and repent of our sins,\u201d prophesied a street vendor in Nairobi\nselling tree tomatoes, popularly known in Kiswahili as _matunda damu_. But\nafter this revelation of a messianic message, the woman admitted that the hint\nof a complete lockdown by the government was a sure way of strangling the\nlivelihoods of people like her.\n\n_\u201cNdiraikara mucii nacio ciana irie ke?\u201d_ You\u2019re asking me to stay at home,\nwhat will my children eat? _\u201cAko corona niguturaga, reke tukuire guku bara-\nini\u201d._ If the coronavirus is going to kill us, let us then die on these\nstreets, hustling. President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s government has already killed\nour businesses, now he is asking us to stay at home \u2013 _tumurie kana twikie\natia?_ We feed on him? Or how does he propose we should fend for our families?\n\nThe vendor was angry that the president exhibited a laissez-faire attitude\ntowards battling the deadly virus. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop the plane that came\nfrom China? If he had done that, we wouldn\u2019t be in this bad situation and our\nlivelihoods would not be threatened.\u201d\n\nThe plane that she was referring to was a China Southern Airlines flight that\nwas allowed to land at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on 26\nFebruary 2019. The flight had arrived in Nairobi despite a directive\nforbidding flights originating in China to land in Kenya due to the outbreak\nof COVID-19 in China. Kenya Airways had also by that time suspended all its\nflights to and from China. This particular plane carried 239 passengers, many\nof whom were Chinese nationals. The airport employee who posted a video of the\nplane landing was suspended (and later reinstated through a court order),\nwhich suggested that the plane had the government\u2019s permission to land. The\nreference to this plane and the anger it has generated among the people I\ntalked to was evident throughout all my interviews.\n\n> The vendor was angry that the president exhibited a laissez faire attitude\n> towards battling the deadly virus. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop the plane that came\n> from China? If he had done that, we wouldn\u2019t be in this bad situation and\n> our livelihoods would not be threatened.\u201d\n\nThe weekend before the quasi-lockdown decreed by the government on Monday, 23\nMarch 2020, I was in Nakuru County. My first stop was at the Java House\nlocated in CK Patel House in central Nakuru town. It was 10.00 a.m. and there\nwas absolutely no customer. I found the manager sipping her coffee latte.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked her. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the house\u201d.\n\nThe nonplussed manager said the coronavirus was bad for business. \u201cLook, it is\nmid-morning, a peak time when customers should be flocking in for their\nrefill, yet we\u2019ve an empty house.\u201d\n\nThe coffee house closes at 5 p.m., which is normally a peak hour when\ncommuters wait for the traffic jam to ease off before heading home. \u201cThis is\nnot a harbinger of good times,\u201d said one of the lady waiters. \u201cIf this\nsituation persists long enough, who knows, the management could easily send us\nhome\u2026this, by the way, is not good at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incompetence of this government and President Uhuru is mindboggling,\u201d\nsaid a lady I was meeting in Nakuru town. \u201cWhy, in God\u2019s name, did he allow\nthe plane from China to land at JKIA?\u201d she furiously wondered aloud. \u201cHe\nshould have ordered the plane to turn back, the way it came and never to allow\nthe passengers to disembark. Do we know how many of those passengers could\nhave been infected all the way from China? Do we know how many people they,\nindeed, could have infected once here in the country? Who knows where those\npeople are and which corner of the country they are in? Did the government\never track them down?\u201d\n\nThe lady was convinced that if the government had refused the landing of that\nplane, it is probable that we would not be so afraid now and there would not\nreally have been a case for a (quasi) lockdown.\n\n\u201cThe government now is all over issuing edicts \u2013 it must always do the wrong\nthing first before it turns around to sound the alarm bells,\u201d she said. People\nseem to be impressed by the new Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe,\nI\u2019m not. What ordinary Kenyans want to know is how, in the event of a complete\nlockdown, they will earn a living. Period. Endless press conferences\nthreatening us with damnation are neither here nor here. The President\nrecently threatened us, saying the government will crack down on anybody not\nadhering to the stay-at-home edict. This is uncalled for as well as unhelpful.\nDoes he have any concrete plans for ameliorating the situation and ensuring\nKenyans who live from hand to mouth are cushioned?\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, I was at Garden Villa, located on the western side of\ntown as you head to Shaabab residential area. It was completely empty and the\nwaiters were just lounging around. Garden Villa is an expansive nyama choma\neatery, as well as a \u201cwatering hole\u201d with appropriate cushioned-seat cubicles\nfor groups of people or couples. It was glaringly in its emptiness.\n\nBeatrice, our waitress, was not amused by coronavirus coming to Kenya: \u201cIt is\nno longer a death scare; it has come to actually destroy our livelihoods. I\u2019ve\nthree children \u2013 two in university and one is finishing high school. My job\nhas really sustained me, I\u2019ve been able to educate my children so far with the\ntips that I collect here and there from patrons like you. When there are no\ncustomers, we are finished. I\u2019m really worried. If this situation continues\nlike this, we\u2019ll all be declared redundant. What will happen to my children?\u201d\n\nBack in Nairobi, I went to one of my usual Java House haunts. The security\nguard was forthright: _\u201cHii kitu itauwa watoto wetu. Sijui leo nita peleka\nnini nyumbani.\u201d_ This thing called coronavirus will kill our children. Today I\ndon\u2019t know what I will take home.\n\nThe main work of security guards like one at Java House is to ensure that\npatrons enjoy their house coffee without probing eyes and disturbance from the\ncity centre\u2019s \u201cundesirables\u201d, and to usher patrons inside the coffee house.\nThey help customers find car park spaces and guard the automobiles from\nhoodlums. They will also offer concierge services to patrons, such as carrying\nstuff to their vehicles. At the end of the day, they have enough pocket money\nto pass through the supermarket and buy some milk and bread for tomorrow\nmorning\u2019s breakfast. He told me the lack of patrons meant that he would go\nhome empty-handed. _\u201cMungu asaidie afukuze hii coronavirus, kama siyo hivyo\ntumeisha.\u201d_ The almighty should intervene and clear this coronavirus as\nquickly as possible, otherwise we\u2019re all finished.\n\n#### **Prayer warriors**\n\nIn the city centre, at the famous Jevanjee Park, I met a group of four middle-\naged women. They were talking with each other. On the day the government\nordered the people not to leave their houses after 7 p.m., they disobeyed and\ntrooped to town. \u201cI\u2019m staying in the house and then what happens?\u201d posed one.\n\u201cAre my children going to feed on me?\u201d\n\nThe women were \u201cprofessional\u201d casual labourers. Lately they have been getting\nmanual jobs from the Nairobi County as grass cutters and street sweepers.\n\n\u201cWe live on a day-to-day basis\u201d said one of the women. \u201cHow on earth does the\ngovernment expect us to survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d ventured one of the women, \u201cyesterday I went to church\nbecause our pastor had sent word around that we must not fail to go church.\u201d\nShe told me she attends a Kenya Assemblies of God (KAG) church. Their pastor\ntold them that coronavirus had come to Kenya to remind Christians that,\nindeed, these were the last days.\n\n> Back in Nairobi, I went to one of my usual Java House haunts. The security\n> guard was forthright: _\u201cHii kitu itauwa watoto wetu. Sijui leo nita peleka\n> nini nyumbani.\u201d_ This thing called coronavirus will kill our children. Today\n> I don\u2019t know what I will take home.\n\n\u201cCoronavirus is not going to be defeated by worshippers staying at home,\u201d\nclaimed the pastor. \u201cIt is going to be wrestled down to the ground by prayer\nwarriors. We must condemn the evil-doer, we must never doubt our faith. We\nmust never doubt our God, Is this the time to let our able God down? Are we\ndoubting Him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Catholic and we went to church. The parish priest, through _jumuia_\n[small community groups], sent word that we must all be in church on Sunday\nwithout fail,\u201d said one of the woman. \u201cThe priest said the body of Christ is\nasking us, \u2018Are you not going celebrate with me? For is this the time to\nforsake me?\u2019 It is always fundamentally important to remember to keep the\nfaith.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe churches cannot, even for once, pretend that they care for our welfare,\u201d\nsaid another woman. \u201cIn these times of economic turbulence and the coming of\nthe corrosive coronavirus, all what the churches can tell us is to still go\nand congregate in congested spaces. And all what this government can tell us\nis to sanitise our hands. The church and the government\u2019s work is to fleece\nus, the people.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, I caught up with the same quartet outside Charlies\u2019 restaurant\nthat faces City Hall. It was now past five and they were hungry and angry.\n\u201cHow are we going home?\u201d asked one of them in concealed desperation. All of\nthem lived in the sprawling slums of Nairobi. Seated on the stone bench of the\nrestaurant, they resorted to begging money from any passing man they thought\nthey could remotely recognise.\n\n> \u201cThe churches cannot, even for once, pretend that they care for our\n> welfare,\u201d said another woman. \u201cIn these times of economic turbulence and the\n> coming of the corrosive coronavirus, all what the churches can tell us is to\n> still go and congregate in congested spaces. And all what this government\n> can tell us is to sanitise our hands\u2026\u201d\n\nThe following day, I found myself in bustling Kawangware, where the\ncoronavirus threat is real. Kawangware was deserted \u2013 many businesses were\nshut and the human commotion that is usually associated with the sprawling\nresidential area was absent. I dropped in at Sakina\u2019s _kibanda_ (food kiosk-\ncum-shed) in the Coast area (Mombasani) where she sells very pocket- friendly\nfresh food to construction workers, bachelors, spinsters, and all manner of\ncasual labourers. Sakina shared the kibanda with her mother, but her mom was\nnot there on that day.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d I asked Sakina.\n\n\u201cShe took the kids [her four children] to shags [her rural home],\u201d she\nresponded. (Sakina\u2019s rural home is right in the middle of Nyeri town, at\nMeeting Point.) \u201cBusiness is slowly grinding to a halt and we didn\u2019t want to\ntake chances. At least at _cucu\u2019s_ [grandma\u2019s] place, there\u2019s food to eat\u2026this\ncoronavirus has dealt us a huge blow\u2026but alhamdulillahi, it is going to be\ndefeated by Allah.\u201d\n\nIn times like this, said Sakina, it\u2019s important to be steadfast and to anchor\nyour whole self in the great faith.\n\n#### **A disease of the rich**\n\nAt Zambezi trading centre, 19 kilometres from the city centre on the Nairobi-\nNakuru Road, Nyambura, a chicken legs and liver vendor, was preparing her\nfoodstuff for her evening customers.\n\n\u201cAre you not afraid of the coronavirus?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cIndeed I am,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut can I eat fear? Can my children eat fear? I\ncannot stay in the house. I must get out to fend for my family. My husband is\na salaried worker. He has to wait for 30 days to be paid his paltry pay. We\ncannot wait for that. It is my responsibility to supplement the ugali he\nbrings home,\u201d said the lady with a great chuckle.\n\n\u201c[President] Uhuru doesn\u2019t care about us small farmers. He has been careless\nand is playing dice with our lives. After ruining our lives, he has now let\nthis coronavirus invade our country. Why couldn\u2019t he stop that plane from\nChina? Its good coronavirus is infecting the rich and the powerful. They\nshould all perish. They have caused us enough agony,\u201d said Nyambura.\n\n\u201cBut trust me, this coronavirus is not going to finish us because our Lord\nJesus Christ is on the throne. In the name of Jesus, I condemn the disease,\u201d\nshe added.\n\nShe said coronavirus, like the most incompetent government she had lived\nthrough, had conspired to kill the spirit of Kenyans. \u201cYesterday, I paid 100\nshillings from 87 to here. Can you imagine? Ordinarily the matatu fare from\n87, just after Uthiru to Zambezi, is 30 shillings. For how long can one afford\nthat kind of fare?\u201d She said that from the Old Nation House roundabout stage\nto Zambezi, passengers were being charged 150 shillings. I hooked up with my\nfreelance tout friend Davy to confirm whether it was true.\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect when the matatus have been ordered to carry half the\nseating capacity of their vehicles?\u201d said the freelance tout.(The government\nhas directed that public transport vehicles observe social distancing among\ntheir passengers, which means that these vehicles are forced to carry fewer\npassengers per trip.) Davy told me that many matatu proprietors had grounded\ntheir vehicles. _\u201cHakuna haja ya kufanya kazi ya kirai_ \u201d. It\u2019s pointless to\nengage in an unprofitable business.\n\nFrom the city centre to Zambezi, the fare is ordinarily 80 shillings during\npeak hours and 50 shillings during off-peak hours. \u201cThink about it,\u201d explained\nDavy. \u201cThe matatus that have chosen to be on the road are being fair.\u201d\n\nA 33-seater is now carrying 16 passengers. So passengers are paying 150\nshillings instead of 80 shillings in normal times. The Nissan shuttles that\nferry 14 passengers are now having to carry just 8 passengers. Davy said if\nthe government was considerate, it would, at least for now, reduce the price\nof fuel. That way the matatu owners would not be forced to adjust the fares.\n\n\u201cHow many people can afford to be paying 300 shillings every day to town?\u201d\nasked Nyambura. \u201cWhat is it then you are working for? You\u2019ve not even eaten.\nAnd President Uhuru, instead of telling us how the government can come up with\nways of helping us alleviate this burden, has gone on air to tell us about the\nmerits of 4G Internet speed. (On March 23, President Kenyatta addressed the\nnation live on air, extolling the virtues of the business deal between Telcom\nKenya and Google Loon, which would now allow for faster speed and easy\ninterconnectivity.)\n\nIn the political sphere, Nakuru residents believe that the coronavirus\nappeared just in the nick of time to save President Uhuru and the Building\nBridges Initiative (BBI) team the embarrassment of a looming contest and\nshowdown that was to take place in town at Afraha Stadium. On 21 March 2019,\nBBI had organised a rally to popularise its agenda. But every indication\nshowed that this was not going to be a walk in the park for the BBI mandarins.\n\n> A 33-seater is now carrying 16 passengers.

That way the matatu owners would not be forced to adjust the fares.\n\n\u201cThis coronavirus has just given the president some reprieve,\u201d said a Nakuru\nboda boda (motorcycle rider) from Maili Sita trading centre (popularly known\nsimply as Sita) on the Nakuru-Nyahururu Road. The rider opined that had the\nBBI rally taken place, the William Ruto wing of the Jubilee Party would, most\ncertainly, have upstaged the BBI brigade. It was going to be battle a between\nBBI and the deputy president\u2019s \u201cTanga Tanga\u201d band of supporters.\n\nWhen on 28 January 2019 President Uhuru was in Nakuru town to open a cement\nfactory in Rongai, he detoured to Bahati constituency, where at Sita he\nlambasted the area MP, Kimani Ngunjiri. As he was castigating him, Ngunjiri\nwas several metres away from the president\u2019s motorcade. \u201cWhen he left, the\nboda boda riders came to Ngunjiri and they were high-fiving him and laughing\nexcitedly,\u201d said the boda boda rider. \u201cThey promised him that when BBI lands\nin Nakuru, they would show President Uhuru who ruled Nakuru.\u201d\n\nWith all the laments, speculation and tantalising gossip, it is still not\nclear what impact the coronavirus pandemic will have on the lives of ordinary\nKenyans. Many are in still in disbelief and more worried about their\nlivelihoods than about falling ill or dying. But what is clear is that Kenya\nafter corona will not be the same again.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://www.theelephant.info/features/2020/04/03/harsh-\neconomic-times-political-uncertaintyand-now-corona/)\n\n### [Politics](https://www.theelephant.info/./features/)\n\n# Inside the Quarantine: Fears of Further Spreading the Virus Haunt the\nConfined\n\nPerhaps, it won\u2019t take much longer before the country knows whether the\nmandatory quarantine strategy helped spread or stop COVID-19.\n\nPublished\n\n5 days ago\n\non\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\nBy\n\n[John-Allan Namu](https://www.theelephant.info/author/janamu/ \"Posts by John-\nAllan Namu\") [__](https://twitter.com/johnallannamu)\n\n![Inside the Quarantine: Fears of Further Spreading the Virus Haunt the\nConfined](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cvd.jpg)\n\n[Download PDF](https://www.theelephant.info/features/2019/10/17/will-the-new-\ncompetency-based-curriculum-lead-to-declining-educational-standards-in-\nkenya/?print=pdf)[Print\nArticle](https://www.theelephant.info/features/2019/10/17/will-the-new-\ncompetency-based-curriculum-lead-to-declining-educational-standards-in-\nkenya/?print=print)\n\n\u201cWe were flying over Juba when the announcement was made\u201d. Chris*, not his\nreal name, recounts to me his whereabouts when Kenya\u2019s Cabinet Secretary for\nHealth, Mutahi Kagwe, made the announcement that mandatory quarantining of all\npersons flying into Kenya would begin with immediate effect. It was early\nevening in Nairobi and a likely anxious nation tuned in for what was the tenth\nbriefing from the ministry about the global COVID-19 pandemic that had made\nits way to Kenya, on the wings of an aircraft much like the one that ferried\nChris back from a work trip to London.\n\nChris and I spoke a day after his arrival. He was in a hotel turned\ngovernment-sanctioned quarantine facility, the Boma Hotel. The hotel, one of\nfour Kenya Red Cross hotels that had just weeks before been placed under\nreceivership, was dusty, with some rooms not having been cleaned for a while.\nDead flies lined his windowsill. Chris complained that layers of dust on his\npillowcase and bedsheets caused him discomfort. That was a minor inconvenience\nin comparison to the subject of our call.\n\n![Inside the Quarantine: Fears of Further Spreading the Virus Haunt the\nConfined](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/X_window_Q1.jpg)\n\nTheir flight, which arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on the\nnight of Monday, March 23rd, carried what was, in Chris\u2019s estimation, about 60\npeople.\n\n\u201cAfter being screened and filling out immigration forms, we were told about\nthe Ministry of Health\u2019s directive. We protested the directive because some of\nus had made arrangements to self-quarantine. Among those on our flight were\nstudents who, I think, wouldn\u2019t have taken the flight if they thought that\nthey would be taken into mandatory quarantine.\u201d\n\nTheir protests would seem vain in the face of the government\u2019s efforts to slow\nthe spread of the COVID-19 virus, which has overwhelmed some of the world\u2019s\nbest-equipped healthcare systems, but the response to these complaints from\nMinistry of Health officials was even more strange.\n\n\u201cThe government relented and allowed us to leave the airport and go home, with\norders that we report to the Kenya Medical Training Centre (KMTC) at 11:00 a.m\nfor tests.\u201d\n\nChris was picked up by his driver and recalls reaching his home at about\nmidnight on the 23rd of March.\n\nAs he was falling asleep, Doris*, also not her real name, was on a fairly\nempty flight from Germany, a country hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, via\nAmsterdam, back home.\n\n\u201cI was alone on my row, the two rows behind me were empty and the lady in the\nrow next to mine also sat alone.\u201d\n\nHer flight touched down in Nairobi on the morning of 23rd March and taxied in.\nIn the nine hours between the landing of Chris\u2019 flight and Doris\u2019, the\ninformation that passengers were given had differed.\n\n\u201cOur temperature was taken, then we filled a form saying that we would self-\nquarantine. Then we filled the older, yellow immigration form. As we did so,\nthere was a lady shouting that we should all go to KMTC at 11:00 am for\ntesting. That was it.\u201d\n\nDoris had already made plans to self-quarantine. She had found an apartment on\nan online booking site, AirBnB, where she says she was going to stay for the\nrecommended 14-day quarantine. She booked an Uber, made the trip across town\nto her apartment in Kileleshwa, showered, changed and then booked another Uber\nto the KMTC.\n\nBefore they got to KMTC, if Chris and Doris were carriers of COVID-19 and were\ncontagious, they may have spread the disease to at least three people each.\nNeither of them has been asked to account for their movements or the people\nthat they came into contact with; termed by the World Health Organisation as\ncontact-tracing. They do not yet know whether or not they have the virus,\nbecause they have yet to be tested for it. They weren\u2019t alone on their flights\nhome, and sadly, their experience was not unique to them.\n\n#### **Infection within the quarantine facilities**\n\nBoth Doris and Chris are worried about the possibility that they contracted\nCOVID-19 while they were in the throes of evident lapses and confusion that\nthey found at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, and at the KMTC, where\nthey would go as ordered, on the 24th of March, at 11 am.\n\n\u201cWhen we turned up at the KMTC, they closed and barricaded the gates behind\nus, and said that we were officially under mandatory quarantine,\u201d Chris\nremembers.\n\nDoris witnessed the furore of the now hundreds of passengers grow, with them\ncrowding around Ministry of Health officials for answers, having just been\nstung by the news. She tried to hang as far back as she could to avoid coming\ninto contact with the virus.\n\n\u201cWe were then given three options for places that we would undergo quarantine.\nBoma Hotel (where Chris would eventually go), the KMTC and the Kenya School of\nGovernment (KSG) in Lower Kabete, Nairobi,\u201d she remembers.\n\n\u201cBoma would cost us USD 100 (Kshs 10,000) a night (this figure was later\nrevised downwards), and the conditions at KMTC were just awful, so I chose\nKSG. When we got to KSG the director of the campus told us that it would cost\nus USD 40 (Kshs 4,000) a night. People protested again and crowded around the\nofficials telling us this. They then relented and said we would be charged USD\n20 (Kshs 2,000) a night.\u201d\n\nA video taken by one of the passengers shows the proximity of the passengers\nto the officials, and to one another. Again, Doris wisely chose to hang back\nand wait until things calmed down so that she could get a room.\n\nChris chose to stay at the Boma hotel.\n\nWhen Chris\u2019s cohort of travellers arrived at the Boma hotel, he says there was\njust one receptionist at hand to meet them.\n\n\u201cWe all herded around the reception area waiting to be checked in. I am very\nafraid that we may have been exposed while we were getting into quarantine!\u201d\n\nLater that evening, Chris heard the sounds of sirens outside his window.\n\nA hotel staffer told him that ambulance workers in hazmat suits were there to\nevacuate a fellow traveller, an elderly lady who allegedly fell ill.\n\n\u201cWe are all so worried\u201d.\n\nEven with the inconveniences they have experienced, both Doris and Chris\u2019s\nworry extends to the unanswered question they both have \u2013 were they both\ncomplicit in some way in the spread of COVID-19?\n\n\u201cIf the government was serious about a mandatory quarantine, why did they let\nus go home first?\u201d Chris asks, the tone of his voice deep and serious,\nunfettered by the muffles and crackling on the phone line.\n\n\u201cThere were people on our flight who took public transport from the airport\nand to KMTC. How many people have they been in touch with?\u201d\n\nThe question of how the virus spreads is no longer in contention, but there\nare concerns about the handling of passengers who were being put in isolation\nin order to contain COVID-19\u2019s spread in Kenya.\n\nDr Ahmed Kalebi, the founder and CEO of Lancet Laboratories, which is among\nKenya\u2019s first private laboratories to offer PCR tests for COVID-19 (Polymerase\nChain Reaction tests detect the genetic material of COVID-19, called RNA),\nshares his worries about the possible contagion that people in the mandatory\nquarantine may be facing.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is a big scare. I am privy to what has been going on in some of\nthose facilities and it has been a bit of a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf two hundred people go into a hotel and three or four of them have\nCOVID-19, by keeping them in close proximity we are creating an incubating\nchamber (for the virus).\u201d\n\nDr Kalebi believes that in late April, Kenyan cases of COVID-19 will have\nrisen exponentially. Government models publicized on Monday 30th March put\nKenya at possibly having 10,000 cases by that time.\n\nSeveral accounts from persons currently in mandatory quarantine speak to the\npotential for this, especially as they were being transferred into quarantine\nfacilities. Doris, who was being quarantined at the Kenya School of Government\nfacility, Chris at the Boma hotel, and Caleb* (not his real name), a traveller\nwho is currently in quarantine at the Kenyatta University Conference Centre,\nall give similar accounts about how risky the first day of their return was.\n\nThey were all supposed to be part of a Ministry of Health-led mass testing\ncampaign of the over two thousand Kenyans currently in quarantine facilities,\nbeing carried out beginning the weekend ending March 29th. Chris took a photo\nof a Ministry of Health official in a Hazmat suit from a common area at the\nBoma hotel.\n\n![Inside the Quarantine: Fears of Further Spreading the Virus Haunt the\nConfined](https://www.theelephant.info/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/hazmat_suited_guy_Q1.jpg)\n\nDoris, Chris, Caleb and other travelers in quarantine that I spoke to all say\nthat they feel healthy, save for a few coughs and sniffs which they hope are\nsigns of a cold rather than COVID-19, but they may not be out of the woods,\neven as the days wind down to the end of their quarantine.\n\n\u201cThe Coronavirus takes between two to fourteen days to incubate,\u201d says Dr\nKalebi.\n\n\u201cIf tests were done at day seven, which is what the government is doing this\nweekend (weekend ending March 29th), you may have only a few people testing\npositive, who would be taken to more stringent quarantine facilities. Then you\nwait another week. Assume more people get infected. On day 14, when you are\nreleasing them, people may have been infected in quarantine.\u201d\n\nFears that the government quarantine facilities may become petri dishes for\nthe spread of the virus are valid, but over-estimated, according to Professor\nOmu Anzala, who specializes in virology and immunology. He\u2019s also part of the\ntaskforce set up by the government to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak in\nKenya.\n\n\u201cThere is that possibility but we have not seen anybody go more than 14 to 15\ndays without having come down with the disease. We have not seen anybody who\nhas gone more than 15 days who is not showing symptoms but is secreting the\nvirus.\u201d\n\nHe does say that these still are early days and that the government, like all\ngovernments, is learning as it goes deeper into fighting the virus.\n\nIt won\u2019t be long before Doris and Chris get out of quarantine. Perhaps, it\nwon\u2019t take much longer before the country knows whether the mandatory\nquarantine strategy helped spread or stop COVID-19.\n\n_This article was first published

They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n## HR Goes Agile\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n  * [Anna Tavis](/search?term=anna%20tavis)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\nAgile isn't just for tech anymore. It's [been working its way into other areas\nand functions](/2016/05/embracing-agile), from product development to\nmanufacturing to marketing--and now it's transforming how organizations hire,\ndevelop, and manage their people.\n\nYou could say HR is going \"agile lite,\" applying the general principles\nwithout adopting all the tools and protocols from the tech world. It's a move\naway from a rules- and planning-based approach toward a simpler and faster\nmodel driven by feedback from participants. This new paradigm has really taken\noff in the area of performance management. (In a [2017 Deloitte\nsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/human-\ncapital/lu-hc-2017-global-human-capital-trends-gx.pdf), 79% of global\nexecutives rated agile performance management as a high organizational\npriority.) But other HR processes are starting to change too.\n\nIn many companies that's happening gradually, almost organically, as a\nspillover from IT, where more than 90% of organizations already use agile\npractices. At the Bank of Montreal (BMO), for example, the shift began as tech\nemployees joined cross-functional product-development teams to make the bank\nmore customer focused. The business side has learned agile principles from IT\ncolleagues, and IT has learned about customer needs from the business. One\nresult is that BMO now thinks about performance management in terms of teams,\nnot just individuals. Elsewhere the move to agile HR has been faster and more\ndeliberate. GE is a prime example. Seen for many years as a paragon of\nmanagement through control systems, it switched to FastWorks, a lean approach\nthat cuts back on top-down financial controls and empowers teams to manage\nprojects as needs evolve.\n\nThe changes in HR have been a long time coming. After World War II, when\nmanufacturing dominated the industrial landscape, planning was at the heart of\nhuman resources: Companies recruited lifers, gave them rotational assignments\nto support their development, groomed them years in advance to take on bigger\nand bigger roles, and tied their raises directly to each incremental move up\nthe ladder. The bureaucracy was the point: Organizations wanted their talent\npractices to be rules-based and internally consistent so that they could\nreliably meet five-year (and sometimes 15-year) plans. That made sense. Every\nother aspect of companies, from core businesses to administrative functions,\ntook the long view in their goal setting, budgeting, and operations. HR\nreflected and supported what they were doing.\n\nBy the 1990s, as business became less predictable and companies needed to\nacquire new skills fast, that traditional approach began to bend--but it\ndidn't quite break. Lateral hiring from the outside--to get more flexibility--\nreplaced a good deal of the internal development and promotions. \"Broadband\"\ncompensation gave managers greater latitude to reward people for growth and\nachievement within roles. For the most part, though, the old model persisted.\nLike other functions, HR was still built around the long term. Workforce and\nsuccession planning carried on, even though changes in the economy and in the\nbusiness often rendered those plans irrelevant. Annual appraisals continued,\ndespite almost universal dissatisfaction with them.\n\nNow we're seeing a more sweeping transformation. Why is this the moment for\nit? Because rapid innovation has become a strategic imperative for most\ncompanies, not just a subset. To get it, businesses have looked to Silicon\nValley and to software companies in particular, emulating their agile\npractices for managing projects. So top-down planning models are giving way to\nnimbler, user-driven methods that are better suited for adapting in the near\nterm, such as rapid prototyping, iterative feedback, team-based decisions, and\ntask-centered \"sprints.\" As BMO's chief transformation officer, Lynn Roger,\nputs it, \"Speed is the new business currency.\"\n\nWith the business justification for the old HR systems gone and the agile\nplaybook available to copy, people management is finally getting its long-\nawaited overhaul too. In this article we'll illustrate some of the profound\nchanges companies are making in their talent practices and describe the\nchallenges they face in their transition to agile HR.\n\n## Where We're Seeing the Biggest Changes\n\nBecause HR touches every aspect--and every employee--of an organization, its\nagile transformation may be even more extensive (and more difficult) than the\nchanges in other functions. Companies are redesigning their talent practices\nin the following areas:\n\n### Performance appraisals.\n\nWhen businesses adopted agile methods in their core operations, they dropped\nthe charade of trying to plan a year or more in advance how projects would go\nand when they would end. So in many cases the first traditional HR practice to\ngo was the annual performance review, along with employee goals that\n\"cascaded\" down from business and unit objectives each year. As individuals\nworked on shorter-term projects of various lengths, often run by different\nleaders and organized around teams, the notion that performance feedback would\ncome once a year, from one boss, made little sense. They needed more of it,\nmore often, from more people.\n\n[An early-days CEB\nsurvey](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-\ndecision-support/human-resources/pdfs/eliminate-performance-ratings.pdf)\nsuggested that people actually got _less_ feedback and support when their\nemployers dropped annual reviews. However, that's because many companies put\nnothing in their place. Managers felt no pressing need to adopt a new feedback\nmodel and shifted their attention to other priorities. But dropping appraisals\nwithout a plan to fill the void was of course a recipe for failure.\n\nSince learning that hard lesson, many organizations have switched to frequent\nperformance assessments, often conducted project by project. This change has\nspread to a number of industries, including retail (Gap), big pharma (Pfizer),\ninsurance (Cigna), investing (OppenheimerFunds), consumer products (P&G), and\naccounting (all Big Four firms). It is most famous at GE, across the firm's\nrange of businesses, and at IBM. Overall, the focus is on delivering more-\nimmediate feedback throughout the year so that teams can become nimbler,\n\"course-correct\" mistakes, improve performance, and learn through iteration--\nall key agile principles.\n\nIn user-centered fashion, managers and employees have had a hand in shaping,\ntesting, and refining new processes. For instance, Johnson & Johnson offered\nits businesses the chance to participate in an experiment: They could try out\na new continual-feedback process, using a customized app with which employees,\npeers, and bosses could exchange comments in real time.\n\nThe new process was an attempt to move away from J&J's event-driven \"five\nconversations\" framework (which focused on goal setting, career discussion, a\nmidyear performance review, a year-end appraisal, and a compensation review)\nand toward a model of ongoing dialogue. Those who tried it were asked to share\nhow well everything worked, what the bugs were, and so on. The experiment\nlasted three months. At first only 20% of the managers in the pilot actively\nparticipated. The inertia from prior years of annual appraisals was hard to\novercome. But then the company used training to show managers what good\nfeedback could look like and designated \"change champions\" to model the\ndesired behaviors on their teams. By the end of the three months, 46% of\nmanagers in the pilot group had joined in, exchanging 3,000 pieces of\nfeedback.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, a fast-growing biotech company, is going even\nfurther with its appraisals overhaul. Michelle Weitzman-Garcia, Regeneron's\nhead of workforce development, argued that the performance of the scientists\nworking on drug development, the product supply group, the field sales force,\nand the corporate functions should not be measured on the same cycle or in the\nsame way. She observed that these employee groups needed varying feedback and\nthat they even operated on different calendars.\n\n#### Why Intuit's Transition to Agile Almost Stalled Out\n\nThe financial services division at Intuit began shifting to agile in 2009--but\nfour years went by before that became standard operating procedure across the\ncompany.\n\nWhat took so long? Leaders started with a \"waterfall\" approach to change\nmanagement, because that's what they knew best. It didn't work. Spotty support\nfrom middle management, part-time commitments to the team leading the\ntransformation, scarce administrative resources, and an extended planning\ncycle all put a big drag on the rollout.\n\nBefore agile could gain traction throughout the organization, the transition\nteam needed to take an agile approach to _becoming_ agile and managing the\nchange. Looking back, Joumana Youssef, one of Intuit's strategic-change\nleaders, identifies several critical discoveries that changed the course--and\nthe speed--of the transformation:\n\n  * Focus on early adopters. Don't waste time trying to convert naysayers.\n  * Form \"triple-S\" (small, stable, self-managed) teams, give them ownership of their work, and hold them accountable for their commitments.\n  * Quickly train leaders at all levels in agile methods. Agile teams need to be fully supported to self-manage.\n  * Expect that changing frontline and middle management will be hard, because people in those roles need time to acclimate to \"servant leadership,\" which is primarily about coaching and supporting employees rather than monitoring them.\n  * Stay the course. Even though agile change is faster than a waterfall approach, shifting your organization's mindset takes persistence.\n\nSo the company created four distinct appraisal processes, tailored to the\nvarious groups' needs. The research scientists and postdocs, for example,\ncrave metrics and are keen on assessing competencies, so they meet with\nmanagers twice a year for competency evaluations and milestones reviews.\nCustomer-facing groups include feedback from clients and customers in their\nassessments. Although having to manage four separate processes adds\ncomplexity, they all reinforce the new norm of continual feedback. And\nWeitzman-Garcia says the benefits to the organization far outweigh the costs\nto HR.\n\n### Coaching.\n\nThe companies that most effectively adopt agile talent practices invest in\nsharpening managers' coaching skills. Supervisors at Cigna go through \"coach\"\ntraining designed for busy managers: It's broken into weekly 90-minute videos\nthat can be viewed as people have time. The supervisors also engage in\nlearning sessions, which, like \"learning sprints\" in agile project management,\nare brief and spread out to allow individuals to reflect and test-drive new\nskills on the job. Peer-to-peer feedback is incorporated in Cigna's manager\ntraining too: Colleagues form learning cohorts to share ideas and tactics.\nThey're having the kinds of conversations companies want supervisors to have\nwith their direct reports, but they feel freer to share mistakes with one\nanother, without the fear of \"evaluation\" hanging over their heads.\n\nDigitalOcean, a New York-based start-up focused on software as a service\n(SaaS) infrastructure, engages a full-time professional coach on-site to help\nall managers give better feedback to employees and, more broadly, to develop\ninternal coaching capabilities. The idea is that once one experiences good\ncoaching, one becomes a better coach. Not everyone is expected to become a\ngreat coach--those in the company who prefer coding to coaching can advance\nalong a technical career track--but coaching skills are considered central to\na managerial career.\n\nP&G, too, is intent on making managers better coaches. That's part of a larger\neffort to rebuild training and development for supervisors and enhance their\nrole in the organization. By simplifying the performance review process,\nseparating evaluation from development discussions, and eliminating talent\ncalibration sessions (the arbitrary horse trading between supervisors that\noften comes with a subjective and politicized ranking model), P&G has freed up\na lot of time to devote to employees' growth. But getting supervisors to move\nfrom judging employees to coaching them in their day-to-day work has been a\nchallenge in P&G's tradition-rich culture. So the company has invested heavily\nin training supervisors on topics such as how to establish employees'\npriorities and goals, how to provide feedback about contributions, and how to\nalign employees' career aspirations with business needs and learning and\ndevelopment plans. The bet is that building employees' capabilities and\nrelationships with supervisors will increase engagement and therefore help the\ncompany innovate and move faster. Even though the jury is still out on the\ncompanywide culture shift, P&G is already reporting improvements in these\nareas, at all levels of management.\n\n### Teams.\n\nTraditional HR focused on individuals--their goals, their performance, their\nneeds. But now that so many companies are organizing their work project by\nproject, their management and talent systems are becoming more team focused.\nGroups are creating, executing, and revising their goals and tasks with scrums\n--at the team level, in the moment, to adapt quickly to new information as it\ncomes in. (\"Scrum\" may be the best-known term in the agile lexicon. It comes\nfrom rugby, where players pack tightly together to restart play.) They are\nalso taking it upon themselves to track their own progress, identify\nobstacles, assess their leadership, and generate insights about how to improve\nperformance.\n\nIn that context, organizations must learn to contend with:\n\n_Multidirectional feedback._ Peer feedback is essential to course corrections\nand employee development in an agile environment, because team members know\nbetter than anyone else what each person is contributing. It's rarely a formal\nprocess, and comments are generally directed to the employee, not the\nsupervisor. That keeps input constructive and prevents the [undermining of\ncolleagues](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-reportedly-slam-\neach-other-through-this-internal-review-tool-2015-8) that sometimes occurs in\nhypercompetitive workplaces.\n\nBut some executives believe that peer feedback should have an impact on\nperformance evaluations. Diane Gherson, IBM's head of HR, explains that \"the\nrelationships between managers and employees change in the context of a\nnetwork [the collection of projects across which employees work].\" Because an\nagile environment makes it practically impossible to \"monitor\" performance in\nthe old sense, managers at IBM solicit input from others to help them identify\nand address issues early on. Unless it's sensitive, that input is shared in\nthe team's daily stand-up meetings and captured in an app. Employees may\nchoose whether to include managers and others in their comments to peers. The\nrisk of cutthroat behavior is mitigated by the fact that peer comments to the\nsupervisor also go to the team. Anyone trying to undercut colleagues will be\nexposed.\n\nIn agile organizations, \"upward\" feedback from employees to team leaders and\nsupervisors is highly valued too. The Mitre Corporation's not-for-profit\nresearch centers have taken steps to encourage it, but they're finding that\nthis requires concentrated effort. They started with periodic confidential\nemployee surveys and focus groups to discover which issues people wanted to\ndiscuss with their managers. HR then distilled that data for supervisors to\ninform their conversations with direct reports. However, employees were\ninitially hesitant to provide upward feedback--even though it was anonymous\nand was used for development purposes only--because they weren't accustomed to\nvoicing their thoughts about what management was doing.\n\nMitre also learned that the most critical factor in getting subordinates to be\ncandid was having managers explicitly say that they wanted and appreciated\ncomments. Otherwise people might worry, reasonably, that their leaders weren't\nreally open to feedback and ready to apply it. As with any employee survey,\nsoliciting upward feedback and not acting on it has a diminishing effect on\nparticipation; it erodes the hard-earned trust between employees and their\nmanagers. When Mitre's new performance-management and feedback process began,\nthe CEO acknowledged that the research centers would need to iterate and make\nimprovements. A revised system for upward feedback will roll out this year.\n\nBecause feedback flows in all directions on teams, many companies use\ntechnology to manage the sheer volume of it. Apps allow supervisors,\ncoworkers, and clients to give one another immediate feedback from wherever\nthey are. Crucially, supervisors can download all the comments later on, when\nit's time to do evaluations. In some apps, employees and supervisors can score\nprogress on goals; at least one helps managers analyze conversations on\nproject management platforms like Slack to provide feedback on collaboration.\nCisco uses proprietary technology to collect weekly raw data, or\n\"breadcrumbs,\" from employees about their peers' performance. Such tools\nenable managers to see fluctuations in individual performance over time, even\nwithin teams. The apps don't provide an official record of performance, of\ncourse, and employees may want to discuss problems face-to-face to avoid\nhaving them recorded in a file that can be downloaded. We know that [companies\nrecognize and reward\nimprovement](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265063411_What_Do_Performance_Appraisals_Do)\nas well as actual performance, however, so hiding problems may not always pay\noff for employees.\n\n_Frontline decision rights._ The fundamental shift toward teams has also\naffected decision rights: Organizations are pushing them down to the front\nlines, equipping and empowering employees to operate more independently. But\nthat's a huge behavioral change, and people need support to pull it off. Let's\nreturn to the Bank of Montreal example to illustrate how it can work. When BMO\nintroduced agile teams to design some new customer services, senior leaders\nweren't quite ready to give up control, and the people under them were not\nused to taking it. So the bank embedded agile coaches in business teams. They\nbegan by putting everyone, including high-level executives, through\n\"retrospectives\"--regular reflection and feedback sessions held after each\niteration. These are the agile version of after-action reviews; their purpose\nis to keep improving processes. Because the retrospectives quickly identified\nconcrete successes, failures, and root causes, senior leaders at BMO\nimmediately recognized their value, which helped them get on board with agile\ngenerally and loosen their grip on decision making.\n\n_Complex team dynamics._ Finally, since the supervisor's role has moved away\nfrom just managing individuals and toward the much more complicated task of\npromoting productive, healthy team dynamics, people often need help with that,\ntoo. Cisco's special Team Intelligence unit provides that kind of support.\nIt's charged with identifying the company's best-performing teams, analyzing\nhow they operate, and helping other teams learn how to become more like them.\nIt uses an enterprise-wide platform called Team Space, which tracks data on\nteam projects, needs, and achievements to both measure and improve what teams\nare doing within units and across the company.\n\n### Compensation.\n\nPay is changing as well. A simple adaptation to agile work, seen in retail\ncompanies such as Macy's, is to use spot bonuses to recognize contributions\nwhen they happen rather than rely solely on end-of-year salary increases.\n[Research and practice](https://ceo.usc.edu/files/2016/09/CE_PM_FINAL.pdf)\nhave shown that compensation works best as a motivator when it comes as soon\nas possible after the desired behavior. Instant rewards reinforce instant\nfeedback in a powerful way. Annual merit-based raises are less effective,\nbecause too much time goes by.\n\nPatagonia has actually eliminated annual raises for its knowledge workers.\nInstead the company adjusts wages for each job much more frequently, according\nto research on where market rates are going. Increases can also be allocated\nwhen employees take on more-difficult projects or go above and beyond in other\nways. The company retains a budget for the top 1% of individual contributors,\nand supervisors can make a case for any contribution that merits that\ndesignation, including contributions to teams.\n\nUpward feedback from employees to team leaders is valued in agile\norganizations.\n\nCompensation is also being used to reinforce agile values such as learning and\nknowledge sharing. In the start-up world, for instance, the online clothing-\nrental company Rent the Runway dropped separate bonuses, rolling the money\ninto base pay. CEO Jennifer Hyman reports that the bonus program was getting\nin the way of honest peer feedback. Employees weren't sharing constructive\ncriticism, knowing it could have negative financial consequences for their\ncolleagues. The new system prevents that problem by \"untangling the two, \"\nHyman says.\n\nDigitalOcean redesigned its rewards to promote equitable treatment of\nemployees and a culture of collaboration. Salary adjustments now happen twice\na year to respond to changes in the outside labor market and in jobs and\nperformance. More important, DigitalOcean has closed gaps in pay for\nequivalent work. It's deliberately heading off internal rivalry, painfully\naware of the problems in hypercompetitive cultures (think Microsoft and\nAmazon). To personalize compensation, the firm maps where people are having\nimpact in their roles and where they need to grow and develop. The data on\nindividuals' impact on the business is a key factor in discussions about pay.\nNegotiating to raise your own salary is fiercely discouraged. And only the top\n1% of achievement is rewarded financially; otherwise, there is no merit-pay\nprocess. All employees are eligible for bonuses, which are based on company\nperformance rather than individual contributions. To further support\ncollaboration, DigitalOcean is diversifying its portfolio of rewards to\ninclude nonfinancial, meaningful gifts, such as a Kindle loaded with the CEO's\n\"best books\" picks.\n\nHow does DigitalOcean motivate people to perform their best without inflated\nfinancial rewards? Matt Hoffman, its vice president of people, says it focuses\non creating a culture that inspires purpose and creativity. So far that seems\nto be working. The latest engagement survey, via Culture Amp, ranks\nDigitalOcean 17 points above the industry benchmark in satisfaction with\ncompensation.\n\n### Recruiting.\n\nWith the improvements in the economy since the Great Recession, recruiting and\nhiring have become more urgent--and more agile. To scale up quickly in 2015,\nGE's new digital division pioneered some interesting recruiting experiments.\nFor instance, a cross-functional team works together on all hiring\nrequisitions. A \"head count manager\" represents the interests of internal\nstakeholders who want their positions filled quickly and appropriately. Hiring\nmanagers rotate on and off the team, depending on whether they're currently\nhiring, and a scrum master oversees the process.\n\nTo keep things moving, the team focuses on vacancies that have cleared all the\nhurdles--no req's get started if debate is still ongoing about the desired\nattributes of candidates. Openings are ranked, and the team concentrates on\nthe top-priority hires until they are completed. It works on several hires at\nonce so that members can share information about candidates who may fit better\nin other roles. The team keeps track of its cycle time for filling positions\nand monitors all open requisitions on a kanban board to identify bottlenecks\nand blocked processes. IBM now takes a similar approach to recruitment.\n\nCompanies are also relying more heavily on technology to find and track\ncandidates who are well suited to an agile work environment. GE, IBM, and\nCisco are working with the vendor Ascendify to create software that does just\nthis. The IT recruiting company HackerRank offers an online tool for the same\npurpose.\n\n### Learning and development.\n\nLike hiring, L&D had to change to bring new skills into organizations more\nquickly. Most companies already have a suite of online learning modules that\nemployees can access on demand. Although helpful for those who have clearly\ndefined needs, this is a bit like giving a student the key to a library and\ntelling her to figure out what she must know and then learn it. Newer\napproaches use data analysis to identify the skills required for particular\njobs and for advancement and then suggest to individual employees what kinds\nof training and future jobs make sense for them, given their experience and\ninterests.\n\nIBM uses artificial intelligence to generate such advice, starting with\nemployees' profiles, which include prior and current roles, expected career\ntrajectory, and training programs completed. The company has also created\nspecial training for agile environments--using, for example, animated\nsimulations built around a series of \"personas\" to illustrate useful\nbehaviors, such as offering constructive criticism.\n\n#### What HR Can Learn from Tech\n\nThe agile pioneers in the tech world are years ahead of everyone else in\nadopting the methodology at scale. So who better to provide guidance as\nmanagers and HR leaders grapple with how to apply agile talent practices\nthroughout their organizations? In a recent survey, thousands of software\ndevelopers across many countries and industries identified their biggest\nobstacles in scaling and the ways they got past them.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN.png)\n\nFind this and other HBR graphics in our [Visual Library __](/visual-\nlibrary/2018/03/what-hr-can-learn-from-tech)\n\nTraditionally, L&D has included succession planning--the epitome of top-down,\nlong-range thinking, whereby individuals are picked years in advance to take\non the most crucial leadership roles, usually in the hope that they will\ndevelop certain capabilities on schedule. The world often fails to cooperate\nwith those plans, though. Companies routinely find that by the time senior\nleadership positions open up, their needs have changed. The most common\nsolution is to ignore the plan and start a search from scratch. But\norganizations often continue doing long-term succession planning anyway.\n([About half](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-\nresearch/publications/2010-ceo-succession-planning-survey) of large companies\nhave a plan to develop successors for the top job.) Pepsi is one company\ntaking a simple step away from this model by shortening the time frame. It\nprovides brief quarterly updates on the development of possible successors--in\ncontrast to the usual annual updates--and delays appointments so that they\nhappen closer to when successors are likely to step into their roles.\n\n## Ongoing Challenges\n\nTo be sure, not every organization or group is in hot pursuit of rapid\ninnovation. Some jobs must remain largely rules based. (Consider the work that\naccountants, nuclear control-room operators, and surgeons do.) In such cases\nagile talent practices may not make sense.\n\nAnd even when they're appropriate, they may meet resistance--especially within\nHR. A lot of processes have to change for an organization to move away from a\nplanning-based, \"waterfall\" model (which is linear rather than flexible and\nadaptive), and some of them are hardwired into information systems, job\ntitles, and so forth. The move toward cloud-based IT, which is happening\nindependently, has made it easier to adopt app-based tools. But people issues\nremain a sticking point. Many HR tasks, such as traditional approaches to\nrecruitment, onboarding, and program coordination, will become obsolete, as\nwill expertise in those areas.\n\nMeanwhile, new tasks are being created. Helping supervisors replace judging\nwith coaching is a big challenge not just in terms of skills but also because\nit undercuts their status and formal authority. Shifting the focus of\nmanagement from individuals to teams may be even more difficult, because team\ndynamics can be a black box to those who are still struggling to understand\nhow to coach individuals. The big question is whether companies can help\nmanagers take all this on and see the value in it.\n\nThe HR function will also require reskilling. It will need more expertise in\nIT support--especially given all the performance data generated by the new\napps--and deeper knowledge about teams and hands-on supervision. HR has not\nhad to change in recent decades nearly as much as have the line operations it\nsupports. But now the pressure is on, and it's coming from the operating\nlevel, which makes it much harder to cling to old talent practices.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

Diane Gherson, the chief human resources officer at IBM, recently\nspoke with HBR about how that's playing out as the iconic tech company revamps\nits business model. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nHBR: In what sense is IBM putting employee experience at the center of people\nmanagement?\n\nGHERSON: Like a lot of other companies, we started with the belief that if\npeople felt great about working with us, our clients would too. That wasn't a\nnew thought, but it's certainly one we took very seriously, going back about\nfour or five years. We've since seen it borne out. We've found that employee\nengagement explains two-thirds of our client experience scores. And if we're\nable to increase client satisfaction by five points on an account, we see an\nextra 20% in revenue, on average. So clearly there's an impact. That's the\nbusiness case for the change.\n\nBut it has required a shift in mindset. Before, we tended to rely on experts\nto build our HR programs. Now we bring employees into the design process, co-\ncreate with them, and iterate over time so that we meet people's needs.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg)\n\nSally Montana\n\nDiane Gherson, IBM's head of HR\n\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nA good example is employee onboarding--the first process we took a very hard\nlook at. We knew we wanted people to walk out thinking, \"I'm superexcited I'm\nhere, and I understand what I need to know to get going.\" But we started too\nsmall. We approached it in a traditional way that made it all about the\norientation class, all about the experience you have on your first day. Once\nwe began asking new hires how their onboarding had gone, we heard things like\n\"I didn't get my laptop on time,\" or \"I couldn't get my credit card in time to\nget to my first meeting,\" or \"I had problems accessing the internal network.\"\nAll those things affect how someone feels about having joined the company.\n\nOnce you realize that, the remit for the onboarding team becomes how people\nexperience the whole process, end to end. To get it right, you have to work\nwith a broader set of players. You bring in Security to make sure the ID\nbadges are there. You bring in Real Estate to make sure people have a physical\nspace and know where to go. You bring in Networking to make sure their remote\naccess is up and running. All that is part of onboarding. It's not just having\na great meeting with a bunch of other new hires on your first day.\n\nIt took a while for us to understand that. You have to broaden your scope and\nstop thinking in silos in order to create a great employee experience.\n\nHow has IBM's approach to learning and development changed?\n\nPeople consume content on their phones and tablets now--they use YouTube and\nTED talks to get up to speed on things they don't know. So we had to put aside\nour traditional learning-management system and think differently about\neducation and development. Again, we brought in our Millennials, brought in\nour users, and codesigned a learning platform that is individually\npersonalized for every one of our 380,000 IBMers.\n\nIt's tailored by role, with intelligent recommendations that are continually\nupdated. And it's organized sort of like Netflix, with different channels. You\ncan see how others have rated the various offerings. There's also a live-chat\nadviser, who helps learners in the moment.\n\nWe measure HR offerings such as learning with a Net Promoter Score--the\nultimate metric for an irresistible experience. Before, we used a classic\nfive-point satisfaction scale. Even if someone rated you a 3.1, you ended up\nsaying they were satisfied, whereas with Net Promoter, you have to be at the\nfar end of the scale for it to mean anything, because you have to subtract all\nthe detractors. It's much harder to get that, and it gives you much better\nfeedback on what people are experiencing. For learning, at last count, our NPS\nwas 60. That's in the \"excellent\" range, but of course there's still room to\nimprove.\n\nWhat kinds of tools do you use to customize learning?\n\nWith Watson Analytics, we're able to infer people's expertise from their\ndigital footprint inside the company, and we compare that with where they\nshould be in their particular job family. The system is cognitive, so it knows\nyou--it has ingested the data about your skills and is able to give you\npersonalized learning recommendations. It tells you, \"OK, you need to increase\nyour depth in these areas--and here are the offerings that will help you do\nthat.\" You can then pin those or queue them up in your calendar for future\nlearning. The system also looks at how close you may be to earning a digital\nbadge, which we've started using in just the past couple of years to\ndemonstrate which employees have applied skills. The tool then helps you\nachieve the badge by recommending specific webinars and internal and external\ncourses. It's all based on artificial intelligence. Skills inference is at\nabout 96% accuracy at this point.\n\n\"People are less likely to resist change when they've had a hand in shaping\nit.\"\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nWe used to have this laborious manual process of getting people to fill out\nskills questionnaires and having their managers sign off on them. But that\ngets outdated really fast. So we stopped doing that. Instead, leaders in\nparticular job families or industries do spot checks on how well we are\ninferring. They interview employees and identify where they are, comparing\nthat with what the inference was in our system.\n\nIBM has given its performance management system an overhaul as well. How have\nemployees been involved in that process?\n\nAs you know, performance management is kind of a lightning rod in most\ncompanies. Rather than do the typical thing--which would be to do some\nbenchmarking, pull together a bunch of experts, come up with a new design, and\npilot it--we decided to go all out and co-create it with our employees in a\nsort of extended hackathon. We used design thinking and came up with what you\nmight describe as a \"concept car\"--something for people to test drive and kick\nthe tires on, instead of just dealing with concepts. We did that in the summer\nof 2015 and implemented it across the company five months later. That's the\npower of engaging the whole workforce--people are much less likely to resist\nthe change when they've had a hand in shaping it.\n\nTo start the co-creation process, I blogged about it one day and said, \"We'd\nlove your input. If you hate it, we'll start over, no problem. But we really\nwant your thoughts.\" We made a few videos about what we thought it might look\nlike. I got 18,000 responses overnight. Fortunately, we had the technology to\nanalyze it all and see what people liked and didn't like.\n\nAt first some people said, \"This is such a sham--you already know what you\nwant to do.\" But we explained that we really wanted to hear from them, and we\ngot them into various discussion forums. It took a while, but I think we did\nturn them around. We kept communicating, saying, \"OK, you liked this; you\ndidn't like that. And here are areas where you can't seem to agree.\"\nMeanwhile, we were putting together prototypes to show people.\n\nI was clear up front that there were some ground rules. For example, we were\nnot going to get rid of performance discussions, and we wanted pay-for-\nperformance. But in general, it was wide open. The whole process took less\ntime than most companies take to redesign their performance management\nprograms, and we involved about 100,000 employees. Finally, we asked, \"What do\nyou want to call it?\" Tens of thousands of people voted. We had three names in\nthe end, and Checkpoint was selected.\n\nPerformance management can never be perfect. But your baby is never ugly. Our\nemployees created their own program, and there is pride in that. You can see\nit in their ongoing blogs, where we ask them to talk about what's working and\nwhat's not and to tell us how we can improve the system. We've been doing that\never since we put it out there. Their overall message has been \"This is what\nwe wanted.\" It was cited as the top reason engagement improved. People are\ngetting much more feedback out of this system, in much richer ways. And more\nimportant, they are not feeling like spectators in our transformation; they\nare active participants.\n\n\"We've been able to swiftly detect problems and commit to doing something\nabout them.\"\n\nHow are you using \"sentiment analysis\" to further address employees' needs?\n\nSentiment analysis is very helpful in a world where people are always\ncommenting online. Our cognitive technology looks at the words people choose\nand picks up the tone. It identifies whether it's positive or negative and\nthen goes deeper, saying whether it's strongly positive or strongly negative.\nIn that way it's almost like looking at music--seeing where there are very\nhigh notes or very low notes that are loud. It's always behind our firewall,\nnever external. It's not looking at any of the information people pass around\nor at their e-mail content or browsing behavior. It's just looking at tone in\ntheir blogs and comments inside the firewall.\n\nWith this approach you can pick up pretty quickly if there's an area you need\nto dive into. We've been able to swiftly detect problems that are starting to\nbrew and, more important, make a commitment to do something about them. This\nis the most exciting part of having a social platform to work with. We've had\nseveral examples of things we did wrong. Some of my folks decided we wouldn't\nreimburse for ridesharing. Employees became agitated, and I could quickly\nrespond to a concern that had turned into a petition. \"I read all your\ncomments,\" I told them, \"and you made some great points we hadn't thought of.\nWe were trying to look out for your security, but on balance, this wasn't the\nright choice. Let's return to our original policy.\" All this happened within\n24 hours. People felt listened to and were very appreciative.\n\nWe had a similar situation about a year ago. We had to impute income when you\nwere traveling to a client site for a full week and, instead of returning home\nright away, you had your spouse or a friend join you for the weekend. Because\nwe would reimburse the guest's travel, it created a tax issue. We altered the\nprogram because that was getting messy, and again employees were incensed. I\ncan certainly understand why. If you're on the road all the time, of course\nyou might want your spouse to join you for a weekend. People didn't want us\nmaking the decision for them. That was another case where we quickly got\ntogether and said, \"Hey, if they want to be responsible for their own taxes,\nthey can do it.\" It was a good wake-up call for us to not be so paternalistic.\n\nIn organizations where people aren't physically all together, you can use\nsentiment analysis to get a sense of where you've got trouble spots, where\nyour management isn't strong enough, where groups of people are expressing\nnegative opinions. It allows you to check in on those sites or groups and find\nout what's going on.\n\nDo employees have more power now than in the past?\n\nYes. So much more weight is now given to what is said inside an organization,\nbecause it can be heard outside as well, through social media. Glassdoor is a\nperfect example. In the past you might have had companies that weren't great\nto work for, but only a small circle of people knew about it. Now the whole\nworld knows about it, because it's on Glassdoor--and that's turned companies\ninto glass houses. People can look in and see what's going on and make\njudgments about whether they want to work there in a way that they weren't\nable to before.\n\nLet's go back to the business reasons behind IBM's shift to agile talent\npractices--can you say more about those?\n\nI mentioned client satisfaction. Clients today are looking for speed and\nresponsiveness like never before. In an earlier era what they really wanted\nwas the best product at the best price--efficiency was important, but speed\nwas less so.\n\nIn the early 2000s we would have staffed a project with experts from all over\nthe world, and they would have spent a fraction of their time on that project,\nbecause they were also working on other projects. They would have joined\nconference calls, which is always hard because people are in different time\nzones. And I'm sure they were multitasking while they were on those calls.\nThat project might have taken six months to a year. Now we would take a\nsmaller group of dedicated people and put them together for three months, and\nthey would get it all done using agile methodology. It's a different way of\nthinking about how to create value for clients. It responds to their need for\nspeed.\n\nIs there some hope that an agile approach to talent will help IBM make up\nground in revenue and growth that it lost in its transition to cloud computing\nand other businesses?\n\nWe're a company that's transforming itself: 45% of our revenue comes from\nbusinesses we were not in five years ago, and we are an $80 billion company.\nWhen you're going through that kind of shift and seeing a downturn in some of\nyour legacy businesses, and you're renovating those while you're launching new\nbusinesses, you may see some unevenness in performance. You're basically\nchanging the tires while you're driving the car. And yes, that takes agility.\n\n* * *\n\n[Lisa Burrell](/search?term=lisa+burrell) is a senior editor at _Harvard\nBusiness Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n## One Bank\u2019s Agile Team Experiment\n\n  * [Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic%20barton)\n  * [Dennis Carey](/search?term=dennis%20carey)\n  * [Ram Charan](/search?term=ram%20charan)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n![COLORMOS/GETTY\nIMAGES](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_BARTON.jpg)\n\nCOLORMOS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWhen web and mobile technologies disrupted the banking industry, consumers\nbecame more and more aware of what they could do for themselves. They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/110-dominic-barton.jpg)\n\n[Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic+barton) is the global managing partner\nof McKinsey & Company.

conference.\n\nCommenting at Riviera Maritime Media's European Dynamic Positioning\nConference, held in London on 4 February 2020, delegates said more needs to be\ndone to reduce the risk of vessels striking offshore production facilities and\ndrilling rigs.\n\nOil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) technical advisor Faisal\nRashid said energy companies were interested in improving DP operations and\nreducing risk. \"When vessels are within the 500-m zone, oil and gas companies\ntake on the risk and we need to know how safe the vessel is and how it is\noperated in that zone,\" said Mr Rashid.\n\nPart of this assurance comes from vessel owners and shipyards writing and\nusing effective failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) reports and guidance for\nDP operators on how to tackle emergency situations.\n\nMr Rashid expects OCIMF will publish new guidelines for DP system FMEA\nassurance on its website in June 2020. \"This document is still under review,\nbut it will be like a client checklist for the offshore industry,\" he said.\n\nEquinor principal consultant for marine operations Helge Satendal agreed FMEAs\nneed to be reviewed and potentially rewritten to reduce risk of failures\nresulting in accidents.\n\n\"The quality of FMEA needs to be enhanced and we need to raise awareness of\nthe importance of properly setting alarm points and having clear alarm\nmessages,\" said Mr Satendal. \"There also needs to be a strengthening of the DP\nsystem integrator's role during commissioning,\" he added.\n\nHis comments came from recommendations made by Norway's Petroleum Safety\nAuthority in a report into last year's accident involving platform supply\nvessel (PSV) Skansi Offshore's _Sjoborg_ striking Equinor's Statfjord A oil\nproduction platform in the Tampen area of the North Sea.\n\nThis occurred on 7 June 2019 after a thruster failure and loss of DP on\n_Sjoborg_ resulted in the PSV being pushed towards the platform by prevailing\nweather. That resulted in damage to facility lifeboats and 17 days of delays\nin returning Statfjord A back into production from a planned shutdown period.\n\n\"The other thrusters could not hold its position,\" said Mr Satendal. \"As the\nPSV was on the weather side of Statfjord A, the vessel drifted into the\ninstallation.\"\n\nHe said there was no alarm from the blackout safety system prior to the\nthruster failure, which would otherwise have given the crew time to terminate\nDP operations within the 500-m safety zone around the offshore platform.\n\nAdditionally, crew were inundated with alarms from the engineroom, vessel\npropulsion and bridge systems. Between 18 May and 7 June there were 116\nprediction alarms raised on the PSV.\n\nMr Satendal said more integration systems from separate vendors was needed to\nprevent these multiple alarms occurring and to improve system communications.\n\nInternational Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) said there were 125\nreported DP issues during 2019, down 15% from the year before. Of these 75\nwere reported as undesired events, 19 were DP incidents and were 31\nobservations of DP operations issues.\n\nIMCA technical advisor Reza Yaghoobi said the main cause of these issues was\n\"loss of thruster and propulsion\" while secondary causes included electrical\nissues. The most common DP operations where issues occurred involved cargo\nloading and unloading operations offshore.\n\nMr Yaghoobi felt the revision of guidelines on DP assurance and annual system\ntrials could reduce such risks. He also thought improvements in DP operator\nand engineer training and competence would prevent minor issues becoming major\nincidents.\n\nIMCA marine technical advisor Andy Goldsmith said the application of the DP\npractitioner accreditation scheme would improve the quality of system\nengineering.\n\n**Improving DP competence**\n\nOf the 125 issues reported to IMCA last year, 43% were stemmed from human\nerror, hence the importance of improving DP operator competence.\n\nDuring the conference, Nautical Institute launched its third edition of the\n_DP Operators Handbook_ , which provides advice on DP principles and systems,\nredundancy and equipment class, operational planning and watchkeeping and\noperator training and competence requirements. There are also sections on\nposition reference systems, propulsion and thrusters, power plant and DP\ncontrols.\n\nTechnipFMC marine superintendent Vicky Gren agreed that vessel operators\nneeded to invest in training for DP competence: \"DP competence is about\ninvesting in people,\" she said, adding that such training should focus on\nensuring drills are realistic and preparing DP operators for incidents on\nboard.\n\nShe said: \"Competency is about safety of personnel, vessels and the\nenvironment. It is remaining ready for emergency situations and exposing\npeople to potential challenges to provide better services to clients.\"\n\nSimulation training improves DP operator competence by enabling them to test\ntheir skills in different scenarios. Simwave technical manager Cinthya Lopes\nsaid that using simulators allowed DP operators to practice in a safe\nenvironment and to broaden their knowledge and performance.\n\nHowever, she noted that DP engineers should also undertake simulation training\non maintenance courses to reduce risk of equipment and system failures.\n\n\"What about training both DP operators and engineers together on the same\ncourse?\" Ms Lopes suggested. \"They can get an overview on how systems work and\nfamiliarisation training together.\"\n\nShe also stressed the need to improve communications and training involving DP\noperators, engineers and shore-based managers to help managers better\nunderstand daily routines and operations.\n\n[![Cinthya Lopes \\(Simwave\\): DP operators and engineers could be trained\ntogether](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/066/28EVEDP20_Session3_Cinthya_LopesWEB.jpg)](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/066/28EVEDP20_Session3_Cinthya_LopesWEB.jpg)\n\nCinthya Lopes (Simwave): DP operators and engineers could be trained together\n\n**DP applications outside of the oil patch**\n\nDNV GL segment director for special ships Arnstein Eknes thinks future demand\nfor DP systems will come from aquaculture and passenger shipping and noted\nexisting installations on cruise ships. \"We expect DP on ferries and cruise\nships, although they may not need classed DP,\" he said at Riviera Maritime\nMedia's European Dynamic Positioning Conference. \"DP will also be needed on\nfish-farm support vessels and we are seeing more DP2 on shuttle tankers.\"\n\nMr Eknes anticipates an acceleration in the deployment of DP systems on\nwindfarm support vessels and walk-to-work (W2W) vessels and said that in the\nlong-term, DP would be required for seabed mining vessels and port vessels.\n\nAt the conference, Kongsberg Maritime DP product advisor for maritime\noperations Kristian Ivar \u00d8ien said DP systems on ferries will enable automatic\nunberthing, transit and docking. The first trial of such technology is taking\nplace on a ferry sailing between Horten and Moss in the Oslo Fjord, Norway.\n\n\"Passenger ferries is a new market for DP with autonomous operations, but with\nhumans in the loop responsible for monitoring operations and [who] can take\nover if there are any issues,\" said Mr \u00d8ien.\n\nHe expects to see more use of DP for the remote control of vessels from\nonshore control centres. \"It can be a one-to-one operator station or more\ninterestingly, one person remotely controlling multiple vessels,\" said Mr\n\u00d8ien.\n\nGuidance Marine optical technology group manager David McKnight highlighted\ndemand for DP systems and target-less laser reference sensors on LNG bunkering\nships.\n\n\"LNG bunkering has similar rules as OSVs,\" said Mr McKnight. \"Hoses go across\nto vessels transferring hazardous cargo, so there is a need for DP systems.\"\n\n[Dynamic Positioning](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-\nhub?tags=Dynamic%20Positioning)[Offshore](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-\ncontent-hub?tags=Offshore)[Offshore Support\nJournal](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-\nhub?tags=Offshore%20Support%20Journal)[Offshore Support\nVessels](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-\nhub?tags=Offshore%20Support%20Vessels)[Regulations &\nCompliance](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-\nhub?tags=Regulations%20%26%20Compliance)[Safety &\nIncidents](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-\nhub?tags=Safety%20%26%20Incidents)\n\n[![Linked\nIn](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/Icon/Icons/17ihLinkedInIcon.svg)](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[![Twitter](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/Icon/Icons/17ihTwitterIcon.svg)](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[![Facebook](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/Icon/Icons/17ihFBIcon.svg)](javascript:void\\(0\\);)[![eCard](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/Icon/Icons/17ihEcardIcon.svg)](https://www.rivieramm.com/ecards?dkey=detail&skc=453679&cat=1&RefDoc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Erivieramm%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Dcontent%2Dhub%2Fnews%2Dcontent%2Dhub%2Fimprove%2Ddp%2Dassurance%2Dand%2Dtraining%2Dto%2Denhance%2Dosv%2Dsafety%2D57978)\n\nMost Viewed\n\n1\n\n## [\u00d8rsted lays out ambitious path towards carbon\nneutrality](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/oslashrsted-lays-out-\nambitious-path-towards-carbon-neutrality-57884)\n\n2\n\n## [Update: what we know about the ongoing 'tanker\nwar'](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/what-we-know-about-detained-\niranian-tanker-grace-1-55529)\n\n3\n\n## [Hydrogen fuel cells gain momentum in maritime\nsector](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/hydrogen-fuel-cells-gain-\nmomentum-in-maritime-sector-56087)\n\n4\n\n## [Construction advances on world's first LNG bunker\nATB](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/construction-advances-on-\nworldrsquos-first-lng-bunker-atb-55644)\n\n5\n\n## [Norway's first hydrogen-powered car ferries take\nshape](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/norwayrsquos-first-hydrogen-\npowered-car-ferries-take-shape-55559)\n\nEditor's Choice\n\n[![It PAYS to think differently with Electronic Navigational\nCharts](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/071/Navtor_presentation.jpg)](https://www.rivieramm.com/editors-\nchoice-brand/it-pays-to-think-differently-with-electronic-navigational-\ncharts-58871)\n\n## [It PAYS to think differently with Electronic Navigational\nCharts](https://www.rivieramm.com/editors-choice-brand/it-pays-to-think-\ndifferently-with-electronic-navigational-charts-58871)[Sponsored by\nNavtor](https://www.navtor.com \"Navtor\")\n\n[![Covid-19 &lsquo;wreaks havoc&rsquo; onshore but offshore wind relatively\nunscathed](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/064/Wind_turbine_blades_Thumb.jpg)](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-\ncontent-hub/covid-19-lsquowreaks-havocrsquo-onshore-but-offshore-wind-\nrelatively-unscathed-58771)\n\n## [Covid-19 'wreaks havoc' onshore but offshore wind relatively\nunscathed](https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/covid-19-lsquowreaks-\nhavocrsquo-onshore-but-offshore-wind-relatively-unscathed-58771)\n\n[![Why 90% of the world&rsquo;s LNG fleet have Air Products N2 generators\nonboard](https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/070/Cristoph_De_Margerie_87803.jpg)](https://www.rivieramm.com/editors-\nchoice-brand/air-products-nitrogen-generators-58770)\n\n## [Why 90% of the world's LNG fleet have Air Products N2 generators\nonboard](https://www.rivieramm.com/editors-choice-brand/air-products-nitrogen-\ngenerators-58770)[Sponsored by Air\nProducts](https://www.airproducts.no/products/products-overview/air-products-\nfor-marine/ \"Air Products\")\n\n[![Do you find it challenging to maintain the condition of your engine due to\nthe current travel restrictions?

This new leadership requires\ndifferent skills to lead organizations into the future successfully.\n\nThe challenge is that few businesses are offering [emerging\nleaders](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/216209/develop-managers-\nleaders.aspx?g_source=link_wwwv9&g_campaign=item_246551&g_medium=copy) the\nscope of experience they'll soon need. According to a study by the American\nManagement Association, [48% of\norganizations](https://trainingmag.com/sites/default/files/030_trg0715AMA3.pdf?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_246551&utm_medium=copy)\nbelieve that developing global capabilities in their leaders is a top\npriority. That being said, [only 18% of multinational\ncompanies](https://www.td.org/Publications/Blogs/Global-HRD-\nBlog/2016/06/Global-Leadership-Development-No-Easy-\nTask?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_246551&utm_medium=copy) say they\nhave the strong global leadership pipeline necessary to meet their future\nbusiness challenges.\n\n[A new report by\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-\ntrends.html) examines the needs of the future workplace given these changing\ndynamics. As organizations become social enterprises, they are under increased\nscrutiny from the public and their stakeholders. Social Enterprises bring\nmeaning back to the workplace and combine generating profits with respect and\nsupport for employees, customers, and the communities in which we live.\nLeadership in these organizations must reflect values of diversity and\ntransparency.\n\nI recently spoke with Deloitte\u2019s US Human Capital Leader, [Erica\nVolini](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/profiles/evolini.html), about the\nchanging work environment and the three most important leaderships skills\nrequired to manage these future challenges.\n\nToday In: [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/forbeswomen)\n\n  * [\n\n### Three Mistakes You\u2019re Making In Trying To Achieve Work Life Balance\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2020/04/08/three-mistakes-youre-\nmaking-in-trying-to-achieve-work-life-balance/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How 3 Major LGBTQ Centers Are Virtually Keeping Their Communities Alive\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollysprayregen/2020/04/07/how-3-major-lgbtq-\ncenters-are-virtually-keeping-their-communities-alive/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Three Reminders For Nonprofit Leaders During COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alyssawright/2020/04/07/three-things-nonprofit-\nleaders-need-to-remember-during-covid-19/)\n\n **Bonnie Marcus:**   The new report addresses how organizations now need a\nnew type of leadership. What\u2019s driving this?\n\n**Erica Volini:**   First, the workforce is radically different. Not only is\nit diverse in terms of race, ethnicity and age, but there\u2019s diversity in how\nthey think about work. The fastest growing segment of the workforce is the\nalternative workforce, the gig economy. If you\u2019re a leader, you have to manage\na workforce that is very complex and diverse, and has a lot of different needs\nand different styles of working.\n\nSecondly, organizations right now are under the spotlight externally and have\nto listen to and actively manage what\u2019s happening in the external environment.\nLeaders need to play a role in driving that. They need to not only be managing\ntheir stakeholders internally but have to be managing their stakeholders\nexternally across the ecosystem, which is a brand new skill for leaders to\nhave.\n\nFinally, the issues facing organizations are more complex than they\u2019ve ever\nbeen. Everything about work is changing; the influx of technology, geographic\nexpansion, an increasingly complex global world, increased regulations from\nthe government.\n\n**Marcus:**   What type of leadership do organizations now need?\n\n**Volini:**   Leaders today need to have an inclusive leadership style. They\nneed to be extremely agile. They need to be able to be fluid and evolve as the\nmarket evolves. They need to be externally connected and on top of the trends\nthat are happening. It\u2019s not like these attributes are brand new. It\u2019s not\nlike managing a complex workforce is new, but it\u2019s complexity at a new scale.\nIt not like being externally connected wasn\u2019t important before, but it\u2019s more\nimportant now because there\u2019s so much happening in the external environment.\nSo you need to take those variances and shift the expectations and change the\ncompetency framework for leadership. You need to make sure those revised\ncompetencies are embedded in your performance management system and in your\ncompensation system. And you have to change every process in how you develop\nleaders.\n\n**Marcus:**   How must leadership programs adapt to teach these new skills?\n\n**Volini:**   A lot of leadership programs today are focused on education. We\nsit leaders down in a classroom and give them content. Our view is that\nleadership training needs to be a combination of education, experience, and\nexposure.\n\n**Marcus:** How does an organization foster experience and exposure?\n\n**Volini:**   In order to give someone the right exposure, a company may get\nthem into networks or programs outside the company. There are so many\ndifferent experiences and opportunities that leaders can have externally that\nthey can bring back to the organization. This addresses the point of being\nmore connected with the external environment and leveraging what\u2019s out there.\nBut to me the big shift is changing leadership programs from being education\nfocused. This is about a fundamental shift in how we think about these\nprocesses. And these leadership programs need to start early in people\u2019s\ncareers.\n\n**Marcus:**   What can women do to prepare themselves for this type of\nleadership?\n\n**Volini:**   Women need sponsors. They need people to champion them, give\nthem exposure, pull them into opportunities where they may not naturally get\nthe opportunity. And the best thing in my mind that any woman can do is\ndevelop those sponsors early. Because if you have the true sponsors, they\u2019re\ngoing to help you get the exposure you need to move up the ladder.\n\nThis is really hard because sponsorship can\u2019t be driven by a formal program.\nIt has to form naturally and oftentimes there aren\u2019t natural opportunities for\npeople to get to know each other. Women have to work very hard to seek out\nsponsors. But I also think that when organizations know that inclusion and\ndiversity of thought is a high business priority, they have more accessibility\nto those types of interactions.\n\n**_Bonnie Marcus, M.Ed. empowers professional women to advance their careers.\nShe is an executive coach, speaker and author of[The Politics of Promotion:\nHow High Achieving Women Get Ahead And Stay Ahead (Wiley\n2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Promotion-High-Achieving-Women-\nAhead/dp/1118997425)_**\n\n\n\n[![Bonnie Marcus](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/bonniemarcus/files/2017/03/Bonnie-\nMarcus_avatar_1489153032-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/people/bonniemarcus/\n\"Photo of Bonnie Marcus\")\n\n[Bonnie\nMarcus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/people/bonniemarcus/)\n\nI'm an executive coach, author, and international speaker with a passion for\nhelping professional women gain the visibility and credibility they need to\nhave a fulfilling\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nI'm an executive coach, author, and international speaker with a passion for\nhelping professional women gain the visibility and credibility they need to\nhave a fulfilling career.

* [Rafiq Gemmail](/profile/Rafiq-Gemmail/)\n\nInfoQ recently published the video of a talk given at AgileAus 2019, titled\n\"[The Evolution of the Agile\nCoach](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/spotify-agile-coaches)\" by\nSpotify's Erin McManus, and Fiona Siseman. McManus, an engineering manager,\nand her colleague Siseman, a coaching manager, discussed how the role, needs\nand competencies of an Agile coach differ between established Agile cultures\nsuch as Spotify's, and those organisations still undergoing a transformation.\nThey shared how Spotify produces \"full-stack coaches\" who are as comfortable\ncoaching continuous improvement at the enterprise level as with teams and\nindividuals. Similarly, Shane Hastie, InfoQ editor and ICAgile's director of\nlearning, has also recently [written](https://medium.com/icagile/your-agile-co\n\naching-journey-d22fcf6cced4) about the competencies and the learning path of a\ncoach working towards the prestigious and peer validated ICAgile Certified\nExpert in Agile Coaching. The learning journey of a coach is ongoing and\nrequires a breadth of skills to serve those being coached.\n\nA 2019 academic study by Gisela Backlander titled \"[Doing complexity\nleadership theory: How agile coaches at Spotify practise enabling\nleadership](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/caim.12303)\"\ndescribes six principles which Spotify coaches adhere to in order to achieve\ntheir goal of \"building high performing teams and a high performing\norganisation.\" McManus and Siseman explained these six principles.\n\n  * **Establishing and reinforcing simple principles:** This the \"why are we doing\" rather than \"what we're doing,\" explained Siseman. This activity also includes coaching an action bias and encouraging high-bandwidth communication, like jumping on hangouts, for more effective communication.\n  * **Increasing Context Sensitivity:** McManus shared how they help teams become aware of their context. She gave the example of coaching teams to help them to think about how the things they are doing can affect other teams, as well as the tribe and mission goals.\n  * **Observing and Influencing Group Dynamics:  **Siseman said that Spotify coaches use their \"experience to judge whether action is needed or not.\" She pointed out that \"just a coach inserting themselves into a conversation can change the team dynamic and change the conversation.\" Siseman shared that she will \"prioritise the best learning for the team in that moment.\"\n  * **Making the Unseen Visible:** McManus described coaching to help teams become aware of actions not aligned with their goals. She described this further, saying that \"coaches make those situations more apparent and therefore easier to address, by choosing questions and playing back situations.\"\n  * **Boosting and Supporting other leaders:** Siseman shared how they help grow existing leaders. Examples included book clubs for product owners and teaching \"engineering managers individual coaching skills to use with their direct reports.\"\n  * **Facilitating and encouraging positive dialogue:**  McManus shared that as a coach, they do this by \"being present and engaged and listening to the dialogue in the moment.\" She asks questions such as, \"Is everyone contributing in this moment? Is everyone being heard? Are they interacting in a respectful way?\" McManus said that \"if any of these things aren't in place, then we gently redirect the conversation back to where those things are happening.\"\n\nMcManus and Siseman shared how Spotify coaches have managers who support them\nby investing in understanding the role of a coach. They explained as full-\nstack coaches that they wear multiple hats which range from facilitation and\nteam coaching, to being agents for organisational change themselves.\n\nHastie, who himself is an ICAgile Certified Expert in Agile Coaching,\ndescribed the start of the coaching journey as one where a coach's core skills\nalign with the [ACI Coaching\nFramework](https://www.agilecoachinginstitute.com/agile-coaching-resources/).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*VRdsUz1LSJOnm-MB)\n\nThis [ACI Agile Coach Competency\nFramework](https://www.agilecoachinginstitute.com/agile-coaching-resources/)\nspecifies several areas in which a coach should build their competencies:\n\n  * Being an agile practitioner, Hastie explains that the Agile coach must have a deep understanding of the \"why?\" He wrote that \"they need to be able to lead by example and show the teams under their guidance what it means to be agile in their way of thinking and working.\"\n  * Teaching is a competency which enables the coach to \"teach people new skills, and they must be able to do so effectively.\" Hastie writes that there are multiple styles of teaching in which to acquire improvement, \"formal or informal, in a classroom with a large group or in a conversation with a single individual.\"\n  * Professional coaching is a discipline in its own right, for which the coach requires competence. Hastie writes \"coaches honour the client as the expert in his or her life and work and believe every client is creative, resourceful and whole.\"\n  * Technical, Business, and Transformation Mastery are examples of domains where the coach should have the deep mastery to support and mentor within their organisations and coachees. Hastie wrote that coaches \"must be able to demonstrate deep knowledge and real mastery in a domain and have a working knowledge of the other two.\"\n\nSharing his own personal journey during a\n[talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEB0jcPxvtw) for London's Adventures\nwith Agile community in 2019, Hastie provided more depth on the relationship\nbetween coach and coachee:\n\n> Establishing trust is a vitally important skill set of a coach. Because\n> you're asking people to expose their uncertainties, their questions. The\n> things they are struggling with. You are guiding them on a journey. Being\n> present. Being fully engaged with the coachee at all times.\n\nHastie talked about how \"you will have different coaches for different aspects\nof your practice.\" Using himself as an example, he talked about the\naccountability which comes with knowing your own limitations:\n\n> I am an Agile coach. I might have a specific skillset I'm bringing and I'm\n> good at coaching you in that area. One of the things I have to know as a\n> coach is where I'm not good. And when to suggest there is someone else who\n> can help there. That's about accountability. It's not an all care, no\n> responsibility position.\n\nMcManus spoke about how coaches provide incremental value which is not always\nvisible at first sight:\n\n> Coaching in an agile organisation delivers incremental value. That\n> incremental value is harder to see. So it is really important to be clear\n> about what it is and why it's valued.\n\n### Rate this Article\n\nAdoption\n\nStyle\n\nAuthor Contacted\n\n####  This content is in the [Culture & Methods](/culture-methods/) topic\n\n##### Related Topics:\n\n  * [Culture & Methods](/culture-methods/)\n  * [Coaching](/Coaching/)\n  * [Coaching and Mentoring](/coaching_mentoring/)\n  * [Agile](/agile/)\n  * [Lean](/lean/)\n\n  * #### Related Editorial\n\n  * #### Related Sponsored Content\n\n    * #####  [ Powerful Feature Flags in React ](/infoq/url.action?i=19170&t=f)\n\n  * #### Related Sponsor\n\n[\n![](https://res.infoq.com/sponsorship/topic/2016/optimizelyRSBlogo-1583753544833.jpg)\n](/infoq/url.action?i=19172&t=f)\n\n**Free, Unlimited Feature Flags**.

Behavioural competency is defined as behavioural\nattributes and traits of an employee to make them be able to achieve an\norganisation\u2019s target.\u201d\n\nThe programme is also expected to enhance coordination and collaboration\namongst sectors and instil a spirit of public service including public\nadministration system, HR management and development practice, e-governance,\nand Driglam Namzha.\n\nDorji Choidup said highly qualified, learned and experienced professors and\nlecturers of RIM and senior (working and retired) bureaucrats from relevant\nagencies would provide the training.\n\n##### Share this entry\n\n  * [Share on

It can become impossible to find the right person for the job if\nyou don't first identify what the ideal candidate needs to succeed.\"\n\nCompetency-based selection is a process of evaluating candidates' behavioral\nattributes\u2014as well as their skills and knowledge\u2014by using role-based models\nand structured interviews to determine their fit for a position.\n\n\"You can hire for technical competencies all day long, but, if your new hires\ndo not align with the company's guiding principles and culture or the role's\nbehavioral competencies, you're setting them up for failure,\" said Michael\nGoldberg, managing director of MMGoldberg & Associates, an HR and talent\nacquisition consulting firm based in Dallas.\n\n\"Competency models are not one-size-fits-all, and they are very dependent on\nthe job in question,\" said Tara Gullans, industrial organizational\npsychologist at Caliper, an employee assessment and talent development company\nin Princeton, N.J. \"Hiring managers need to consider the outcomes they are\nlooking for in a certain position and then hire for competencies that will get\nthem to that outcome.\"\n\nGullans added that competency-based selection benefits the organization in\nvarious ways. Competency models can be incorporated into job descriptions to\nattract the right candidates for open positions. Recruiters and hiring\nmanagers use them to evaluate candidates in the selection process. And they\nserve as an employee's baseline for development later on. But they also\nbenefit the candidates themselves.\n\n\"The models add clarity and expectations for a role,\" she said. \"Candidates\nand new hires may want to know if there are certain aspects of the job where\nthey will thrive and others they may need to work on to succeed.\"\n\nLennon added that defining competencies for new hires can help set goals,\nidentify areas for professional development, make decisions about promotions\nand relocate employees in the case of an organizational restructuring.\n\n\"Ultimately, core competencies not only help hire the right people, but also\nensure they are well-equipped to do their job and fulfill their career\naspirations within your company,\" he said.\n\n _[SHRM members-only platform : _[_SHRM\nConnect_](https://community.shrm.org/home?_ga=2.268625778.206560651.1493167936-920689375.1491920969)\n_]_\n\nCreating New-Hire Competencies\n\nLennon said there are job-specific and organizational competencies to\nconsider. To identify job-specific competencies, think about what is required\nto complete the duties of the job, including hard and soft skills, knowledge\nin the field, and behavioral attributes and work style.\n\n\"Determining position-specific competencies will include the input of not only\nthe position's supervisor, but also other employees who work closely with the\nposition,\" he said.\n\nGullans said not to forget to talk to high-performing incumbents in the role.\n\"I want to hear from them what it is they do every day, what is important to\nthem about their job, what makes them successful,\" she said.\n\n\"Keep in mind that you're looking at the job as it is today. People get caught\nup in future potential, which is important to consider, but you don't want to\noverload a new-hire model with future-seeking competencies.\"\n\nOrganizational competencies will be consistent across all roles in a company,\nLennon said. They can be created by identifying norms and behaviors expected\nacross the company.\n\n\"Many of the organizational competencies will relate to the company's brand\nand values,\" he said. \"If your organization has codified its brand, values and\nculture, refer to these as a starting point to help you identify your\norganizational competencies.\"\n\nThat's the low-hanging fruit, Goldberg said. \"Most organizations have guiding\nprinciples, mission and value statements, but 90 percent of them aren't asking\ncandidates questions that align with those.\"\n\nExperts agreed that HR and talent acquisition should work together in\nspearheading competency creation through interviews, focus groups and survey\ndata collection.\n\n\"When creating a competency model, focus on the must-haves, while also noting\nthe competencies that would be nice to have or that you are willing to spend\ntime developing in your new hires,\" Gullans said. \"In a sales role, a must-\nhave would likely be the competency of influence and persuasion. A nice-to-\nhave could be about their time management skills, which might be an area that\nyou can help develop. If you're hiring for a leadership role, it's important\nfor hires to have a big-picture view, make tough decisions and think\nstrategically. A candidate may demonstrate high detail orientation and quality\nfocus, but is this a key competency? Not likely.\"\n\nShe provided the following examples of role-based competencies:\n\n  *  **Bank teller.** People in the role work with customers to complete account transactions. What does that mean in terms of competencies? \"There's a good amount of quality focus\u2014they are working with people's money, typing in numbers,\" Gullans said. \"Another competency is helpfulness, which captures the customer-facing aspect of their job. They must be friendly and able to take ownership of any issues that come up with customers. Following standard practices is important\u2014they are not being asked to be creative as a teller but instead follow strict transaction rules.\"\n  *  **Midlevel manager.** Important competencies would include being able to drive results, communicate performance expectations, delegate responsibility and manage process, Gullans said. From that point you can add in industry-specific requirements.\n\nUsing Competencies to Guide Interviews\n\nOnce you've created competency models for the role and the organization, the\nnext step is integrating the models into the candidate interview process.\n\"Identifying core competencies provides the basis for structuring effective\ninterviews,\" Lennon said.\n\nGoldberg added that recruiters and hiring managers should not just be\npassively asking questions during interviews and assessments but also have a\nway of scoring candidates' answers. \"Listen for what you know will work and\nwhat will not work.\"  \n\n[Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Communication) [Critical\nEvaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation) [External\nRecruiting](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=External Recruiting) [Talent\nAcquisition Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Talent Acquisition\nCommunication) [Interviewing](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Interviewing)\n[Sourcing Strategies](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Sourcing Strategies)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Make+Better+Hires+with+Competency+Models&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/talent-acquisition/Pages/Make-Better-Hires-with-Competency-Models.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

specialist Biosite Systems has partnered with Costain Skanska\nJoint Venture (CSJV) to deliver a competency management system resulting in\n100% conformances at audit.\n\nWorking for High Speed, CSJV was responsible for the South section of the\n\u00a3900million enabling works programme and quickly recognised the need for a\nsophisticated system to ensure total visibility of the almost 3,500 active\nworkforce.\n\nBiosite\u2019s Mosaic solution was tailored to respond to CSJV\u2019s specific\nchallenges to capture and analyse data that would be valuable at both a site\nand group level.\n\nUsing multiple devices to capture the data, the system provides real-time\nmovements for each person \u2013 including direct employees and subcontractors \u2013\nand traceability around agreed key areas, including accreditations and skills\nchecking, health and safety briefings and ethnicity, diversity and inclusion\n(EDI) data.\n\nOnline inductions have also been introduced to allow checks and measures to be\ncompleted in advance and save valuable time on site.\n\nThe system has been deployed by CSJV at all 21 sites of the South enabling\nworks programme, spanning 26.8km.\n\nAlongside the unprecedented 0% non-conformances reported at internal audit,\nthe system has enabled CSJV to respond to increasing demand for enhanced EDI\ndata, as well as capture toolbox talks, safety briefings and a roll call via a\nMobile App.\n\nAt a corporate level, the system is being utilised for comprehensive, real-\ntime reporting via site and corporate portals to analyse worker competencies,\ntime and attendance and skills gaps, all in real-time.\n\nThe system has also been integrated with existing CSJV platforms to maximise\nefficiency and performance, whilst reducing potential conformance issues.\n\nOn an average monthly basis, the system captures more than 220,000 biometric\nevents (operatives entering a site), with more than 27,000 operatives captured\non a mobile device as having completed \u2018classes\u2019, which can include toolbox\ntalks, safety briefings and inductions.\n\nThe scope of the project has meant additional investment in employee resource\nby both Biosite and CSJV, from apprentice level to product specialists,\nengineers and dedicated service support.\n\nAllison Cameron, SHE Administration Manager, Costain Skanska Joint Venture,\nexplains: \u201cBiosite\u2019s Mosaic solution provided vital clarity around an\nincredibly complex project, which was critical to optimising performance and\nmeeting strict timescales.\n\n\"Having an effective competency management solution put us in control of our\nsites by providing the data we needed, when we needed it, which enabled more\ninformed decision-making.\u201d\n\nKamran Ali, Business Manager at Biosite Systems Ltd, added: \u201cThe success of\nthe solution has been a result of the close collaboration between Biosite and\nCSJV during the development and deployment stages, which married the advanced\nsystem capabilities with optimum management and utilisation.\n\n\"As well as achieving 0% non-conformances \u2013 which is phenomenal \u2013 we\u2019re\nthrilled that Allison\u2019s exceptional management of the system has also been\nrecognised with multiple award wins, including an Industry Fire Environment\n(IFE) and Work Sight award.\u201d\n\nBiosite\u2019s Mosaic competency management solution has been specifically\ndeveloped for linear construction projects to help customers effectively\nmanage a highly transient

In\nClinical Trials\n\nBy Beth Harper and David Hadden\n\n![fake chess\npieces](https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/270345ef/270345ef-f381-4be8-be07-ed755dff7631/375_250-istock_1141201373.jpg)\n\nRaise your hand if you:\n\n  1. Like the way you teach or were taught about good clinical practices (GCPs)\n  2. Believe your training approach is effective\n  3. Feel confident that you and you and your team fully understand the complexities of your protocol.\n\nChances are you're in the minority if your hand shot up. This is not only\nastonishing (given the importance of ensuring everyone involved in the\nclinical trial process is competent) but also embarrassing (given that it's\n2020 and we are still using old-fashioned methods to teach clinical research\nprofessionals how to conduct clinical trials).\n\nThe basics of medical practice are to do no harm, and the core tenets of GCPs\nare to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the trial subjects. When\ntraining doesn't allow for practicing clinical research competencies in a safe\nsimulated environment, then we are in danger of violating the principles we\nare trying to teach.\n\nProtocols are also becoming much more complex. Researchers today not only need\nto be proficient on the clinical aspects of complicated protocols but also\nneed to essentially become technologists overnight. Connected devices, study\nmanagement platforms, electronic consent; to steal a phrase from Gen Z -- it's\na lot.\n\nOne could also argue that current approaches to training not only risk harming\nthe research subjects, but also jeopardizing the experience of the learner,\nsetting them up for failure, poor performance, and high turnover rates -- not\nto mention the increased risk of costly protocol deviations. The way to stop\nthis madness is through adoption of a free-from-harm training mentality and\nthe use of modern teaching methods.\n\nMany of the basics about competency, simulation, and better training have been\naddressed in prior articles,1,2,3 so we won't repeat them here, but it's worth\npausing to briefly mention what we know about learning. Edgar Dale's cone of\nexperience/learning pyramid, while adapted and challenged within the learning\nand development industry, still provides a common-sense understanding of how\npeople learn -- by doing.\n\n**_Figure 1:_** _Adaptation of Edgar Dale 's Cone of Learning (image courtesy\nof Pro-Ficiency)_\n\nJust because a clinical research coordinator (CRC) can describe the elements\nof an informed consent document doesn't mean they know _how_ to properly\nadminister and document informed consent. Just because an investigator knows\ns/he is responsible for the oversight of a clinical trial doesn't mean they\nknow _how_ to oversee their staff. Just because a clinical research associate\n(CRA) can explain the ICH GCP requirements for monitoring clinical trials,\ndoesn't mean they know _how_ to monitor. And, just because the entire study\nteam knows the inclusion/exclusion criteria for a protocol doesn't mean they\n_can_ properly or efficiently screen subjects for a trial. You get the\npicture.\n\nCompetency is the combination of knowledge, skills/abilities, and attitude.\nYet most of the way we teach about GCPs and protocols is through didactic\nmethods, focusing on the knowledge part of the equation. Self-study, live\nlectures, and reviewing an eLearning module all have their place. So do\nquizzes and knowledge exams. But in terms of actually helping someone develop\nthe skills and abilities to do the work of clinical research, they fall\nwoefully short. So, where does that leave us?\n\nIf you believe Edgar Dale and you think about your own learning experience,\nit's clear that the best way to learn is by doing. That's really the power of\nsimulation training. The airline/aerospace industry does it, the military does\nit, the medical profession does it.5,6 They all do it because a) it works and\nb) there are high stakes if it's done wrong. When you take a flight or when\nyou have a medical procedure, you trust that the pilot and healthcare provider\nare competent. Would you want to be the passenger on a flight where the pilot,\nwho had studied all the theory, was flying the plane for the first time? Of\ncourse not. So why should we expect our subjects to participate in a clinical\ntrial where the site staff have taken endless hours of eLearning, attended\ninvestigator meetings, or sat through the \"death by PowerPoint\" marches of a\ntraditional site initiation visit without ever having actually practiced the\nprotocol? We shouldn't -- plain and simple!\n\nSimulation addresses another problem, which is how to actually assess\ncompetency. While there are many methods for doing so, most are applied after\nthe fact and don't lend themselves to just-in-time methods that allow for mid-\ncourse corrections before a serious mistake is made.\n\n**_Figure 2:_** _Competency assessment methods (image courtesy of ACRP)_\n\nCase in point: A new CRC has completed their basic GCP training. They have\nread the Belmont Report, Declaration of Helsinki, and ICH GCP guidelines. They\nhave passed the quizzes within the eLearning system and they have proven they\nunderstand the essentials of the informed consent process. Yet, they have\nnever actually practiced conducting and documenting informed consent. While\nthe CRA may be able to identify flaws in the way the process was done several\nmonths later, it's too late. If consent is not conducted properly, the subject\nwill have been exposed to unnecessary risk and the data will be lost.\n\nCertainly, the investigator and CRC's manager could conduct various practice\nsessions in live clinic settings and observe how the CRC performs. But this\napproach is costly, time consuming, inconsistent, and highly biased by the\nobserver. If an inexperienced and unconfident CRC is actually participating in\nthe consenting of a real subject, what's the likelihood that the subject will\nagree to participate? But what if the CRC works through several real-life\nscenarios in a computer-simulated clinic setting? As they go through the\nconsenting and documentation process, they are given choices and options of\nwhat to do next. If they make a misstep along the way, they are given the\nchance to correct their mistake and try again. Proper learning takes place in\na safe environment and is reinforced without ever exposing a real subject to\nthe potential harm. The learner and their manager/mentor can evaluate where\nthey have gaps, address these, and continue through the simulations until they\nperfect their competencies and are ready for real-life consenting. Now apply\nthis same approach to an extremely complicated dosing schedule in a Phase 3\nstudy. If you could predict behavior-based deviations and mitigate those risks\nprior to a single patient being screened, would you sleep better at night? The\nanswer for many sponsors and sites is a resounding yes.\n\nSimulation and competency-based training lends itself to higher cognitive\nskills, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills that are essential for\nclinical research professionals but that can't be developed through\ntraditional methods.\n\nDoes it actually work? Common sense tells you that it must work if all the\nhigh-risk professions mentioned above rely on it. But what about in the\ncontext of a clinical trial?\n\n**_Figure 3:_** _Impact of simulation training on protocol errors (image\ncourtesy of Pro-Ficiency)_\n\nFigure 3 shows the frequency and severity of protocol deviations and\niatrogenic errors that occurred in a study of 150 clinicians and 60 Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supported hospital sites in East\nAfrica. Each red dot represents a simulation of a study subject going through\na clinical trial. The left graph shows many severe deviations. The green\ntarget area represents the range of acceptable performance. The further from\nthe center, the more severe the issue. The right graph shows the performance\nafter seven to 11 hours of computer-based simulation training. The majority of\nclinicians improved their performance substantially.\n\nSo, what's the barrier to adoption? It really boils down to mind-sets and\nmoney. As an industry, we are often challenged with getting out of our own\nway. Getting away from the \"this is the way we've always done it\" mind-set\ntakes courage and leadership. Sure, planning for simulation training takes an\ninvestment of time and resources, but compared to the cost of making mistakes\nin a study, it is pennies on the dollar. Very simply, we must stop thinking\nabout training as a \"check the box\" exercise and begin to recognize training\nand human performance management as a critical risk management strategy.\n\nAt ACRP, we are investing in developing simulation and competency-based\ntraining for clinical research professionals. We believe it's essential to\nshift to more modern methods of competency development and assessment. We also\nbelieve that while the case for action is compelling, the case against not\nacting is even stronger.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n  1. Harper, B.

Why is this and will it lead to safer workplaces?\n\nIn April this year, the Sentencing Council, which produces advice on\nsentencing for courts in England and Wales, published an impact assessment\nreviewing new [guidelines for health and safety\noffences](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/item/health-and-\nsafety-offences-assessment-of-guideline/) that took effect in February 2016.\nIt reported that since 2011 the number of individuals prosecuted for health\nand safety offences has steadily increased and that in 2017 more than a\nquarter of those convicted received an immediate or suspended prison sentence.\n\nWhile the assessment does not identify the proportion of these individuals who\nhad management roles, it is known that the focus has shifted away from\nfrontline employees. In the year to 31 March 2016, [three times as many\ndirectors and managers were\nprosecuted](https://www.shponline.co.uk/sentencing-guidelines/number-\ndirectors-prosecuted-hse-trebles-year/) as had been in the previous year.\n\nOne case that concluded in 2018 provides a good example of this change of\nemphasis.\n\nThe prosecution followed a fatal accident in 2010 at waste company Gaskells\n(North West). An employee, Zbigniew Galka, entered a baler used to compact\npaper and cardboard to remove a blockage. He was able to do this without\nisolating the machine and was crushed in the compaction chamber.\n\nA Health and Safety Executive investigation found the interlock mechanism that\nshould have prevented the baler from operating when the chamber door was open\nhad been disarmed by a maintenance engineer, Michael Cunliffe, shortly before\nthe incident. Cunliffe had emailed management about the modification, which\nwas to bypass a faulty switchboard and keep production running.\n\nGaskells (North West) and Cunliffe pleaded guilty to health and safety\noffences, with the company being fined \u00a3700,000 and Cunliffe receiving a four-\nmonth prison sentence suspended for two years.\n\nHowever, members of management were also prosecuted by HSE for safety\noffences. Managing director Jonathan Gaskell pleaded guilty and received an\nimmediate prison term of eight months. Paul Jukes, the transport and\noperations manager, was prosecuted on the basis that he had taken over the\nresponsibilities of the company\u2019s former health and safety manager after they\nwere made redundant and that he knew about the modification. Jukes denied both\ncharges, but was convicted at trial and jailed for nine months.\n\nHSE\u2019s [enforcement policy statement](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/hse41.pdf)\nsays that during investigations the executive will consider the management\narrangements and the role played by individual directors and managers and will\nprosecute them where it considers this is warranted. The sentencing guideline\nobserves that health and safety offences are concerned with failures to manage\nrisks to health and safety.\n\nArguably, there is now more of an expectation from the public that where a\nhealth and safety incident has resulted in serious injury or death \u2018somebody\nin authority\u2019 should be brought to book. When a company is prosecuted, no one\nindividual stands in the dock. Understandably for the bereaved and injured,\nthis can be distressing. However, it is important to appreciate that health\nand safety prosecutions of individuals are not about ordinary negligence, but\ncriminal failings on the part of the accused.\n\nExperience shows that most health and safety failures - unlike the Gaskells\n(North West) case - happen because a number of things go wrong and when they\ncome together they lead to a bad event. They occur not through commission, but\nmore usually through a series of unintended omissions.\n\nThere can sometimes be a temptation on the part of investigators to look at\nsenior managers with health and safety responsibilities and to equate the bad\nevent with them having done something seriously wrong. While prosecutions\nshould be there to bring home the importance of managing health and safety, if\nthey are perceived as being unfair there is a danger this could discourage\npeople from taking on such roles.\n\nHow can directors and managers protect themselves?\n\nIf investigated, it is important to be able to explain exactly what your role\nand responsibilities are (ideally by reference to a job description) and how\nsafety is managed. This usually entails explaining the systems in place, how\ncompetency of the workforce is achieved and the processes for monitoring and\nreviewing both systems and competency.\n\nIt is also important to obtain independent legal advice at an early stage. In\nthe Gaskells (North West) prosecution, Jukes was not interviewed by HSE until\ntwo years after the fatality, at which point he provided a detailed prepared\nstatement denying responsibility for health and safety. However, when he had\nbeen interviewed by the company\u2019s lawyers as part of its accident\ninvestigation, he had accepted that it was his responsibility. The\ninvestigation report was disclosed to HSE, who subsequently relied on Jukes\u2019s\nearlier statement at trial.\n\nWhether prosecuting directors and senior managers personally will actually\nimprove health and safety remains to be seen. However, given the focus of the\nregulator, now is the time for those with management responsibilities to\nreview their company\u2019s safety management systems and the competencies of its\nstaff.\n\n_Mike Appleby is a partner at Fisher Scoggins Waters LLP and co-author of[\u2018HSE\nand Environment Agency Prosecution: The New\nClimate\u2019](https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/hse-and-environment-\nagency-prosecution-the-new-climate-9781526503220/) published by Bloomsbury\nProfessional.

John Ferrugia, Phil Maravilla on\n\n![](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/blog/20200129_182234_910889_jail-shot.png)\n\nThe state of Colorado has failed for almost a decade to provide mental health\nservices, including evaluations to determine mental competency, to thousands\nof people in jail who are awaiting trial and presumed innocent.  \n  \nDespite multiple court orders to reduce the backlogs, pre-trial detainees who\nrequire mental competency evaluations and treatment are consistently\nlanguishing in Colorado jails or the state mental hospital in Pueblo, often\nfor weeks or even months at a time, in violation of state laws and the U.S.\nConstitution.  \n  \nThe problem has ballooned in recent years as chronic understaffing, a shortage\nof mental health beds and a sharp increase in the number of detainees\nrecommended for competency services all add up to a crisis.  \n  \nRobert Werthwein, the director of the Colorado Office of Behavioral Health,\nacknowledged the state\u2019s failure, telling Rocky Mountain PBS: \u201cWe can do more.\nWe will do more.\u201d\n\n![Robert Werthwein](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/RMPBS/Insight2020/werthweinandjohn.png__616x344_q85_subsampling-2.jpg)Robert\nWerthwein speaks with Insight's John Ferrugia\n\nWhile the history of backlogs dates back more than a decade, the issue\nformally entered into the legal system in 2011 when Disability Law Colorado,\nthe state\u2019s designated watchdog for the mentally ill, then known as the Center\nfor Legal Advocacy, sued the state.\n\n\u201cThrough lack of funding from the state, the competency system really never\ndeveloped and kept pace with the number of new referrals coming in each\nmonth,\u201d Mark Ivandick, the managing attorney of Disability Law Colorado, told\nRMPBS. \u201cThat caused individuals to be warehoused...in jails across the state,\nwithout services.\u201d  \n  \nIn 2012, a federal court ruled in favor of Disability Law Colorado and ordered\nthe state to provide timely competency evaluations and treatment to detainees.\nThe state did not comply \u2013 the settlement agreement lacked enforcement\nmechanisms \u2013 and Disability Law Colorado sued the state several more times.  \n  \nA wakeup call came in April 2019, when a federal court in Denver issued a\nconsent decree ordering the state to abide by strict timetables for both\nevaluating inmates and restoring detainees\u2019 competency or face stiff financial\npenalties.\n\nCurrently the state remains out of compliance with the consent decree, paying\nfines of up to $1.3 million per month, capped at $10 million per year. The\nstate admits it will not be compliant with the timetable at least through\n2020.\n\nState officials, mental health experts and civil rights advocates, including\nDisability Law Colorado, convened in July 2019 to form a governor\u2019s\nsubcommittee to examine the competency problem and provide a template for\nsolutions.  \n  \nThe subcommittee seeks to implement wholesale changes based on the\nsubcommittee\u2019s conviction that the behavioral health system, not the criminal\njustice system, can better serve many low-level, non-violent offenders.\n\nAt the core is a major policy shift that would move some competency services\nfrom the jails and state hospital system into the community, with a focus on\npreventing those who need services from being arrested.\n\nBut those changes are years away.  \n  \nIn response to hundreds of Coloradans currently waiting in jails for\ncompetency services, the state Department of Human Services, the agency that\noversees the Office of Behavioral Health, is adding 24 beds at the state\nmental hospital in Pueblo, supplementing the 70 beds that came online in 2019.  \n  \nAdditionally, the state, for the first time in decades, will provide\ncompetency services at the state hospital at Ft. Logan, funding 44 beds. But\nagain, occupancy there is still years away.  \n  \nSeparately, the Office of Behavioral Health and local governments have\nimplemented programs to provide more timely competency services to detainees.  \n  \nOBH has partnered with two local jails \u2013 in Boulder and Arapahoe Counties \u2013 to\nprovide on-site competency restoration, taking some pressure off the state\nmental hospital in Pueblo.  \n  \nThe program is called RISE \u2013 Restoring Individuals Safely and Effectively.\n\n![Tour of RISE program](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/RMPBS/Insight2020/johnandrise.png__616x343_q85_subsampling-2.jpg)Ashley\nGunterman leads a tour of the RISE space in Boulder  \n  \nAshley Gunterman, the OBH director of jail-based competency evaluation and\nrestoration, showed RMPBS the RISE facility in Boulder. It is carved out of a\nconverted wing of the jail where participants receive treatment away from the\njail\u2019s general population.  \n  \n\u201cThe optics are that it is still a jail,\u201d Gunterman explained as she showed a\ncell that has been converted into a dorm room. \u201cHowever, the measures that\nwe've taken to change them are safety based. And then the therapeutic element\ncomes in with our programming and with our clinical staff.\u201d  \n  \nRISE can provide competency restoration treatment for 18 people in Boulder. In\nArapahoe County, RISE has 94 patient beds.  \n  \nGunterman says RISE has helped ease the backlog for restoration treatment.\nYet, despite this success, she says OBH has no plans to expand the program\ninto other counties.  \n  \n\u201cGrowing them further could potentially impact that success,\u201d Gunterman says.\n\u201cThese programs [in Boulder and Arapahoe] are unique.\u201d She says factors such\nas access to a pool of deputies trained in mental health and clinicians who\nhave experience working with detainee populations make RISE difficult to\nreplicate.  \n  \nWerthwein, the director of OBH, says RISE is not a long-term answer and the\nstate is examining other solutions.  \n  \n\u201cWe're looking at other options, particularly building the outpatient part,\u201d\nWerthwein says. \u201cWe are focused on what we're legally being told by federal\ncourt to focus on, but the problem is much bigger. It's a systemic problem in\nthe state of Colorado.\u201d  \n  \nIt remains unclear if the additional patient beds coming online in Pueblo and\nFt. Logan will be sufficient to ultimately end the backlogs for competency\nservices.  \n  \nMeanwhile it\u2019s costing Colorado taxpayers millions.  \n  \n\u201cWe will still keep paying fines,\u201d Werthwein says. \u201cTo me it's not about the\nmoney. It's about what it symbolizes, that somebody is waiting. It's\nheartbreaking. I mean, there is no other way to put it.\u201d  \n  \nA portion of the fines OBH pays is funneled into programs designed to address\nthe competency services backlog. This backdoor funding mechanism, created by\nthe consent decree, will help pay for community-based restoration services in\nthe Denver metro area.  \n  \nOBH has partnered with the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless to house low-\nlevel, non-violent offenders in four rooms of a Denver hotel the Coalition is\nconverting into homeless housing.\n\n![Denver hotel](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/RMPBS/Insight2020/oldmotel.png__616x437_q85_subsampling-2.jpg)A\nDenver hotel is being converted into housing for the homeless and low-risk\noffenders  \n  \nOBH says it will expand this type of community-based competency restoration\nprogram into other areas of Denver in the near future.\n\nThe shift to community-based competency services will take years to implement.\nIn the meantime, the federal lawsuit and court order have forced the state to\nreview Colorado\u2019s entire mental health system.  \n  \nWerthwein has asked the Office of Behavioral Health and the Department of\nHuman Services to undertake an audit of the $1.4 billion Colorado spends\nannually on mental health.  \n  \nWerthwein hopes the audit will identify priorities and highlight weaknesses so\nthat money can be budgeted more efficiently. Then, he says, if the audit\ndetermines that the state needs more money to meet the mental health needs of\nColoradans, state officials will have data in hand to approach the state\nlegislature for additional funding.  \n  \n\u201cWe want a stronger behavioral health system in Colorado,\u201d Werthwein says,\n\u201cand we're working towards a strong behavioral system in Colorado.\u201d\n\n _If you need mental health services, contact Colorado Crisis Services for\nconfidential support: 844-493-TALK (8255) or text \u201cTALK\u201d to 38255._\n\n[ ![](/s/cms_blogger/img/arrow-left.png)previous post\n\nThe never-ending cycle of the mental health hold: How many ...\n\n|  [ next post![](/s/cms_blogger/img/arrow-right.png)\n\nBehind bars, a threat looms: Deputy nearly dies after attack ...\n\n](/blogs/news/behind-bars-a-threat-looms-deputy-nearly-dies-after-attack-by-\nmentally-ill-inmate/)  \n---|---  \n[![INSIGHT-Donate.jpg](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public/Local%20Programs/INSIGHT-\nDonate.jpg)](https://rmpm.secure.force.com/support/rmpbs/donate) [![Insight-\nLOGO.png](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/Local%20Programs/Insight-\nLOGO.png__320x189_q85_subsampling-2.png)](http://www.rmpbs.org/insight/)\n\n**[Insight with John Ferrugia](http://www.rmpbs.org/news/about/)** **is in-\ndepth, independent and incisive.** John and a team of investigative\njournalists present thoroughly researched stories of significance to Colorado.\n\nProviding Support for RMPBS [Learn More](http://www.rmpbs.org/corpsupport\n\"Support for RMPBS\") [![](https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-\nprod/filer_public/RMPBS/Global/images/logos/Rebrand%20Nov%2019/RMPBS_RGB_word_blk_horz_120x30.png)](/)\n\n  * RMPBS News is funded by: \n  * [John S. and James L.

\u2013 Recruitment and Applicant Tracking\nSystem in the 2019 HRM Asia Readers Choice Awards.\n\nBy: [Paul Howell](https://hrmasia.com/author/paul/ \"Posts by Paul Howell\") |\nDecember 6, 2019\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/)

[Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/TalentMind-RCA-pic.jpg)\n\nSho Kondo, Head of TalentMind, is still celebrating the company for its\nsuccess in the HRM Asia Readers Choice Awards. TalentMind was judged the Gold\nAward winner in the Best HR Tech \u2013 Recruitment and Applicant Tracking System\ncategory, providing an excellent recognition for his team and products.\n\n\u201cHaving the judges and readers evaluate us, and ultimately coming out tops, is\na great justification to the work that we\u2019re doing at TalentMind and AnyMind\nGroup - not just in developing such a powerful platform to help HR and\nrecruitment professionals scale their activities, but also in ensuring our\nclients are able to onboard the TalentMind platform to fit it seamlessly into\ntheir hiring efforts,\u201d he said. TalentMind was launched in January 2018, and\nhas quickly made an impact on recruitment markets across Asia.\n\n\u201cOur objective was to make the recruitment process much more efficient for HR\nprofessionals,\u201d Kondo said. \u201cThis has evolved into a more comprehensive\nplatform that includes an artificial intelligence-driven candidate screening\nfunction and applicant tracking system, but also a HR Information System \u2013\nempowering HR professionals with even more streamlined data utilisation,\ninsight, and action across recruitment and employee management.\n\nArtificial intelligence has only rarely been used in the recruitment function\npreviously, but Kondo says there are powerful applications if the data quality\nis there. \u201cThe beauty in what we\u2019re doing though is combining data points from\nemployees \u2013 including average tenure and performance \u2013 to better guide talent\nacquisition efforts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis provides a more comprehensive and data-\ndriven view into the wider span of HR.\n\n\u201cAt TalentMind, we believe that technology is a true enabler for HR\nprofessionals, reducing manual or mundane work and empowering users to focus\non more strategic aspects of their already vast work scope. Additionally,\nuseable data is no longer limited by geographical or departmental boundaries,\nproviding additional scale to what HR can achieve across the entire\norganisation.\u201d\n\nThe team from TalentMind were unable to join the Readers Choice Awards Gala\nCeremony on November 1, but were excited to receive the trophy at their office\na few days later.\n\n**TalentMind**\n\nTalentMind is a HR technology business and part of AnyMind Group. Through\nTalentMind's recruitment solution, HR professionals can make hiring more data-\ndriven and efficient. Leveraging on an AI-driven screening solution,\nTalentMind identifies and scores potential job candidates through their\nresume, social media and competency data, whilst learning the hiring manager's\npreferences.\n\nAll hiring activity is managed through a single TalentMind applicant tracking\nsystem. TalentMind has also just launched HR management system that manages\nemployee data, including attendance and absences, along with payroll.\n\n[www.talentmind.ai/](http://www.talentmind.ai/)\n\n  \n---  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Readers+Choice+2019%3A+Recruitment+and+Applicant+Tracking+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

This helps managers revise or replace metrics as\ncircumstances change.\n\nManagers may push back against the added work, which involves planning,\nconducting reviews and documentation, but \"HR can help to keep managers on\ntrack,\" Spake said, by showing managers how their departments and the\norganization can benefit from discovering and remedying issues that hinder\nemployee performance.\n\nHR can also train managers to give \"impromptu feedback tailored in a way\nthat's helpful, not hurtful, and to remember that guidance is a gift, not a\nwhip.\" When pointing out problems or mistakes, use such language as \"that's\nwrong,\" not \"you're wrong,\" he noted.\n\nThese performance conversations can complement another performance management\ntrend: ratingless evaluations, Spake said.\n\nJettisoning formal employee ratings \"sometimes just leads to 'shadow ratings'\nbehind the scenes, with less transparency,\" he said. However, there are also\ngood reasons to do away with ratings, he continued. For instance, in the\ncommon ranking of 1 to 5, too often, the number an employee receives becomes\nthe center of the discussion, which eclipses more-productive conversations,\nlike how to improve performance.\n\n\"Establish a clear line of sight between performance and total rewards, even\nwithout ratings,\" Spake said.\n\nHe also suggested breaking up annual bonuses, such as paying them quarterly\ninstead of annually, so they are paid out closer to the performance that's\nbeing rewarded.\n\n_[SHRM members-only how-to guide : _ [ _How to Establish Salary\nRanges_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/how-to-\nguides/pages/howtoestablishsalaryranges.aspx) _]_\n\nEnsure Variable Pay Success\n\nTraditional merit-based pay systems often reward mediocre performance, whereas\na variable pay strategy rewards those employees who add the most value to the\norganization, said John A. Rubino, SHRM-SCP, founder and president of Rubino\nConsulting Services, a global human resources consulting company, during a\nJune 24 concurrent session at the conference.\n\nMost annual base pay increases in the U.S. have been in the 2.8 percent to 3.1\npercent range, \"which is no way to reward your best and brightest employees,\"\nRubino said.\n\n\"Stop pretending that you're paying for performance with base pay\nadjustments,\" he advised. The alternative is a variable pay program, with lump\nsums based on performance. Variable pay increases make it easy to see the link\nbetween results and rewards, but \"putting in place broad-based variable pay\nrequires a culture change within organizations. Some are ready for variable\npay, some are not,\" Rubino said.  \n\n\"Base pay provides a compensation baseline, for expected and predictable\nperformance improvement,\" he added. Salaries, however, grow exponentially, so\nthat each increase raises the base on which future increases are pegged.\n\"Slowing down base pay growth can at least partially fund variable pay\nprogram,\" Rubino said.\n\n\"Salary increases should be based on market value of jobs, determined by\ncomparative position analysis,\" he noted. Salary increases then become market\nadjustments.  \n\n\"Don't go down the road of variable pay until you can ensure that your\nperformance management system works,\" Rubino advised. That's because variable\npay draws on performance management metrics to determine targeted plan\npayouts.  \n\nAll employees can be included in a broad-based variable pay program, with\n[performance payouts often weighted by employee level](/hr-today/news/hr-\nnews/conference-today/Pages/2017/Evolving-Company-Culture-from-Base-Pay-to-\nComprehensive-Variable-Rewards.aspx#variable-pay). For most organizations,\nvariable payouts can range from 8 percent to 19 percent of base pay,\ndetermined by meeting individual, team and organization goals, but often these\nare paid only if the company achieves or overachieves its goals.  \n\n\"Specify what behaviors you want from employees, and structure the program\naround them,\" he said. \"Articulate what outstanding behavior is, and build it\ninto your metrics.\"\n\nInvite employees to write their own goals, aligned to business unit and\norganizational goals, Rubino recommended. Whether metrics are quantifiable\nhard measures or not, the criteria must be valid and discernable.\n\nTo avoid manager subjectivity or biases, use a rating system that solicits\nfeedback from multiple vantage points.  \n\nLike Spake, Rubino noted that employees are motivated by payouts timed close\nto the performance being rewarded. \"Consider paying semiannually or quarterly\nif all performance measures can be accurately evaluated within those time\nframes,\" he advised.  \n\n\"Top performers love variable pay. Your mediocre employees will not. Variable\npay will result in [an increase in] voluntary departures by mediocre employees\nwho just get by and who don't want to play by these rules.\"\n\nHe added, \"Be prepared for turnover when you change the culture.\"\n\nRubino warned, \"You can't change the culture of compensation from the HR\ndepartment.\" Adopting a variable pay approach \"must be supported by top\nleaders on down.\" HR, however, \"can catch the ear of senior executives\" and\nencourage them to get behind a variable pay strategy.  \n  \n\n**Related SHRM Articles :**\n\n[Employers Try Better Ways to Measure and Reward\nPerformance](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/compensation/Pages/better-ways-\nmeasure-reward-performance.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , August 2017  \n\n[Evolving Company Culture from Base Pay to Variable Rewards](/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/conference-today/pages/2017/evolving-company-culture-from-\nbase-pay-to-comprehensive-variable-rewards.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , June 2017  \n\n[Compensation Strategy and\nPlanning](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Compensation Strategy and Planning)\n[Critical Evaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation)\n[Variable Pay](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Variable Pay)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Continuous+Evaluation+and+Variable+Pay+Are+Transforming+Company+Cultures&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/Pages/continuous-evaluation-and-variable-pay-transform-\ncompany-cultures.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

The PIC/S QRM Expert Circle, being well-placed to focus on the QRM\nconcepts of the GMPs and of ICH Q10, is seeking to train GMP inspectors on\nwhat a good risk-based change management system can look like within the PQS,\nand how to assess the level of effectiveness of the PQS in this area,\" PIC/S\nadded.  \n  \n[Draft PIC/S Recommendation on How to Evaluate / Demonstrate the Effectiveness\nof a Pharmaceutical Quality System in relation to Risk-based Change\nManagement](https://www.picscheme.org/en/news?itemid=62)\n\n* * *\n\n[![DEKRA](/RAPS/media/Advertising/2018/Jan/2004RFXDEKRA1_728x90.png)](https://www.dekra.us/en/medical-\ndevice-regulatory-services/overview/)\n\n## Regulatory News\n\n  * Story Thumbnail\n\n###  [Compounding Drugs During the Pandemic: FDA Offers Policy\nClarifications](../../2020/4/compounding-drugs-during-the-pandemic-fda-\noffers-p)\n\n    * 07 April 2020 \n    * By [Zachary Brennan](/news-and-articles/news-articles?author=79531da4-4d5a-49ce-9d78-72d20fe68c4d) \n[ Read More ](../../2020/4/compounding-drugs-during-the-pandemic-fda-offers-p)\n\n  * Story Thumbnail\n\n###  [FDA Offers Expanded Use for ECMO, Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Ophthalmic\nDevices Amid COVID-19](../../2020/4/fda-offers-expanded-use-for-ecmo-\ncardiopulmonary-b)\n\n    * 07 April 2020 \n    * By [Michael Mezher](/news-and-articles/news-articles?author=78cd92e4-508b-4d60-b5be-6c8739fd0184) \n[ Read More ](../../2020/4/fda-offers-expanded-use-for-ecmo-cardiopulmonary-b)\n\n  * Story Thumbnail\n\n###  [IMDRF Consultations Focus on IVD Classifications, Regulatory\nAssessors](../../2020/4/imdrf-consultations-focus-on-ivd-classifications-r)\n\n    * 07 April 2020 \n    * By [Zachary Brennan](/news-and-articles/news-articles?author=79531da4-4d5a-49ce-9d78-72d20fe68c4d) \n[ Read More ](../../2020/4/imdrf-consultations-focus-on-ivd-classifications-r)\n\n[View All News](/news-and-articles)\n\nRegulatory Focus _newsletters_\n\nAll the biggest regulatory news and happenings.\n\n[Subscribe](/news-and-articles/subscribe-to-rf-today) [![CSOFT\nInternational](/RAPS/media/Advertising/2018/Jan/2004RFXCSOFT1.jpg)](https://lifesciences.csoftintl.com/)\n[![DEKRA](/RAPS/media/Advertising/2018/Jan/2004RFXDEKRA1_300x250.png)](https://www.dekra.us/en/medical-\ndevice-regulatory-services/overview/)\n\nRegulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS)  \n5635 Fishers Lane, Suite 400  \nRockville, Maryland 20852\n\nP [+1 301 770 2920](tel:+1 301 770 2920) F +1 301 841 7956 Email:\n[raps@raps.org](mailto:raps@raps.org)\n\n  * [MEMBERSHIP](/membership-community)\n  * [PRESS ROOM](/who-we-are/press-room)\n  * [STORE](https://my.raps.org)\n  * [FAq/HELP](/website/website-faqs)\n  * [FEEDBACK](/website/website-feedback)\n\n  * [Contact](/who-we-are/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise](/who-we-are/advertise)\n  * [Suppliers Guide](/publications-resources/suppliers-guide)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/website/privacy-policy)\n  * [TERMS AND CONDITIONS](/website/terms-of-use)\n  * [Public Safety](/public-safety) \n\n  * [ Twitter](https://twitter.com/RAPSorg)\n  * [ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RegulatoryAffairsProfessionalsSociety/)\n  * [ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/306225/)\n  * [ Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/s/RAPSOrg)\n  * [ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/RegulatoryPros)\n\n(C) 2020 Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society.\n\n\n\n"}, {"item": "Taking measure of a new model: competency-based education -

Take parking, for instance \u2014 the driving instructor won\u2019t give you a\nlicense based on the percentage of times you\u2019ve been able to park the car, or\nfor a good attendance record in your driver\u2019s education classes. The only way\nto pass is to demonstrate that you can, indeed, park, says Stack, who is\nprincipal of Sanborn Regional High School in Kingston.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t pass? Well, that\u2019s simple, Stack says \u2014 you take the test\nagain.\n\n\u201cWhat counts is that when I give you this car, you\u2019re going to park it in that\nspot, and you\u2019re going to do it successfully, right?\u201d Stack said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s\nthe whole kind of basis of a competency-based approach.\u201d\n\nA growing movement in education argues this type of approach should be used in\nthe classroom, with an emphasis on students demonstrating what they can do\nwith what they know in order to gain credit. And New Hampshire is one of a\nnumber of states that have enacted policies paving the way for schools to\nimplement these kinds of competency- or proficiency-based models.\n\nIn 2005, the state [changed its minimum standards for school\napproval](https://www.education.nh.gov/documents/nh-story.pdf) to require that\nhigh school credit be earned by demonstrating mastery of required\n\u201ccompetencies,\u201d or learning goals. Since then, districts across the state and\nthe Monadnock Region have implemented some practices associated with\ncompetency-based education.\n\nAs the slow shift unfolds, schools are also tasked with getting their\ncommunities up to speed about how this type of education model works \u2014 and as\nevidenced in a few local school districts, that process can come with some\ngrowing pains.\n\n **\u2018Competency-based\u2019 breakdown**\n\nA standard definition for competency- or proficiency-based education \u2014 terms\noften used interchangeably \u2014 is elusive. That\u2019s because the way \u201ccompetency\u201d\nis measured and reported can vary so much from school to school.\n\n\u201cI always tell parents that we\u2019re being more deliberate with how we measure\nlearning,\u201d said Stack, who has been working with competency-based education\nfor about a decade at Sanborn. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the basis of going to this kind of\na model.\u201d\n\nThe underlying philosophy is that students should gain credit for mastering\nskills and concepts rather than for the amount of time they spend in class.\nUnder such a model, schools define competencies in a given subject, and\ndepending on the school, students may need to show proficiency in a competency\nbefore advancing to the next one. Theoretically, this kind of \u201cmove when\nready\u201d system allows students to work at their own pace, potentially\nproceeding more slowly or more quickly than their peers.\n\nThe model often includes changes to the way schools assess students and report\ntheir progress. Many competency-based schools separate academic grades from\n\u201cwork habits,\u201d such as teamwork, responsibility and creativity. Schools might\nalso do away with a traditional grading scale based on percentages, with the\nidea being that a student is either proficient in a skill or not.\n\nAnd if a student doesn\u2019t reach proficiency in a certain competency, they\u2019ll\ntypically be given an opportunity to work with their teacher \u2014 often during\n\u201cintervention\u201d periods scheduled into the school day \u2014 to meet that learning\ngoal.\n\nBut which of these elements are implemented \u2014 and how \u2014 depends on the school.\nMost of these concepts are in use at [Sanborn Regional High\nSchool](https://www.sau17.org/Content2/46), for example. Students are assessed\nwithin a [four-point\nrubric](https://www.sau17.org/userfiles/-4/my%20files/16srhsrc.pdf?id=99)\nranging from \u201climited progress\u201d to \u201cexemplary\u201d rather than a traditional A to\nF scale, and separately scored on work habits such as effective communication.\n\nThe school is in the process of exploring ways to implement the \u201cmove when\nready\u201d philosophy, Stack said, with the idea being a blended model of small-\ngroup classroom instruction supported by technology and online learning to\nallow students to move at their own pace.\n\n[Brattleboro Union High School](http://buhs.wsesu.org/proficiency-based-\nlearning.html) began exploring proficiency-based education in 2013, and last\nyear rolled out a side-by-side grading system that combines letter grades and\nproficiency scores for \u201ccritical indicators,\u201d according to Principal Steve\nPerrin.\n\nBut the most important change under competency-based education happens in the\nclassroom, he said. In Brattleboro, teachers might work with small groups of\nstudents separated by their level of progress rather than lecturing to the\nwhole class, Perrin said. And students are given more freedom to demonstrate\ncompetency, perhaps opting to create a graphic novel about the periodic table\nrather than writing an essay.\n\nPart of the benefit is helping teachers think more intentionally about what\nthey are assessing, according to Perrin.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teacher, I could write an 87 on a paper, and nobody knew what\nthat meant. But now when I write that score, I have a rubric that I can\nactually look at, and I can say, you did this, you did this, you did this,\u201d\nPerrin said. \u201cSo for a student, it\u2019s much more clear \u2014 if it\u2019s done well \u2014\nit\u2019s much more clear what the teacher\u2019s asking.\u201d\n\nAbout six years ago, [Stevens High\nSchool](https://shs.sau6.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_160356/File/News/Stevens%20High%20School%20Profile%202018-2019.pdf)\nin Claremont introduced a grading system in which students gain credit for\nmarks of proficient, proficient plus or proficient with distinction, according\nto Principal Patricia Barry. This year, the school is ready to begin scoring\nwork habits separately, she said.\n\nThe idea of separating those measures is that teachers can more easily see\nwhere students need improvement, whether they need help developing their work\nethic or understanding content.\n\n\u201cIn the old system, you could do all your homework, you could do great on\ncertain things and get enough points to pass. But we were passing kids along\nwho weren\u2019t reading at the grade level, they weren\u2019t writing at grade level,\u201d\nBarry said. \u201cAnd so the idea being that when done with fidelity, competency-\nbased education will eliminate that from happening.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stack, the model is about creating competent students rather than\n\u201ccompliant\u201d students who know how to gain points through memorization, class\nparticipation and good work habits, but may not have mastered the skills\nthey\u2019ll need after graduating.\n\n\u201cAll the information that you need is on your cellphone. We don\u2019t need to\nteach kids what all the information is; we need to teach them how to interpret\nthe information so that they can be successful in life,\u201d Stack said. \u201cIt takes\na different kind of school to do that.\u201d\n\n **What about college?**\n\nIdeally, a fully competency-based high school would also eliminate GPA and\nclass rank, Stack said. But many schools \u2014 including Brattleboro, Sanborn and\nStevens \u2014 maintain some of those traditional practices alongside elements of\nthe proficiency-based model.\n\nAt least in Sanborn\u2019s case, that\u2019s partially because schools still have to\noperate in a broader education system that values those measures, Stack said.\n\n\u201cWhen nobody wants that anymore, it\u2019ll be the best day in the world for me,\nbecause it\u2019s the worst thing that we can do in terms of grading,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\ntells us nothing about what kids have learned, but it\u2019s still the system that\npeople are using.\u201d\n\nBut not all educators agree on that point. From Barry\u2019s perspective, the two\nschools of thought can coexist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that numbers and letters and proficiency grading are mutually\nexclusive. I think they all can live in the same world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just\ndon\u2019t want to go back to saying that you just have to get 65 points to pass.\u201d\n\nSweeping philosophical changes like doing away with letter grades and GPA are\ntypically hard for some parents and students to swallow, educators say,\nprimarily because they worry about what it will mean when it comes time to\napply for college.\n\nTo address those concerns, the New England Secondary Schools Consortium\nreached out to colleges and universities across the region to find out how\nthey evaluate students with competency- or proficiency-based transcripts.\n\nA total of 79 higher education institutions, including selective schools such\nas Harvard, Bowdoin and Dartmouth, [responded with\nstatements](https://www.newenglandssc.org/resources/college-admissions/)\nsaying that students with proficiency-based transcripts will not be at a\ndisadvantage in the admissions process at those schools.\n\nAnd the concept of competency-based education is not foreign outside the\nNortheast. According to iNACOL, a nonprofit organization focused on education\npolicy and systems, [48 states had enacted policies as of June\n2018](https://www.inacol.org/news/competencyworks-releases-updated-competency-\neducation-state-policy-map-for-the-united-states/) allowing schools to pursue\ncompetency-based education in some way. New Hampshire is one of 17 \u2014 along\nwith Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island \u2014 considered \u201cadvanced\u201d in competency-\nbased education policy.\n\nAccording to Peg Richmond, director of admissions at Keene State College,\ncounselors there are no strangers to competency-based education models. When\nstudents apply, their transcripts include a \u201c[school\nprofile](https://www.sau17.org/userfiles/86/my%20files/2018_2019%20srhs%20profile.pdf?id=2195),\u201d\nshe said, with information about demographics, course offerings, grading\ncriteria and other relevant background to provide context for admissions\nstaff.\n\nThat helps the institution understand the nuances of each school\u2019s grading\nsystem, she explained, whether a school is competency-based or follows another\neducational tradition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the responsibility of the students or their parents to be concerned\nabout how this is going to affect college admissions,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe college and university\u2019s responsibility to learn how this education is\nbeing delivered, how it\u2019s being evaluated, what those competencies mean and be\nsure that still, the most important thing in mind [is], is that student\nprepared for the rigor of the work at your college or university?\u201d\n\nKeene State already receives applications from nontraditional and charter\nschools whose transcripts are entirely narrative-based, Richmond said, and\nadmissions staff are equipped to evaluate those applicants. But narrative-\nbased transcripts are also more labor-intensive, she noted, and she\nanticipates the workload would become a challenge if more schools opted for\nthat format.\n\nStill, she said, having more information about applicants can help colleges\nevaluate them more holistically.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re thinking about ... the students who are coming to our institution,\nhow great is it for us to know more about their competencies and their skills\nin addition to their grades?\u201d Richmond said. \u201cIt\u2019s a treat.\u201d\n\n **\u2018A work in progress\u2019**\n\nFrom Sanborn to Jaffrey to Hinsdale, educators often start conversations about\ncompetency-based education with one reminder: It\u2019s a work in progress.\n\nThough the state changed its minimum standards for school approval back in\n2005, many Granite State schools are still in the early stages of\nimplementation. According to Julie Couch, bureau administrator for the N.H.\nDepartment of Education\u2019s Bureau of Instructional Support, that\u2019s partially\nbecause the state left the specifics \u2014 such as grading and assessment systems\n\u2014 under local control.\n\nNew Hampshire requires that schools develop competencies aligned with state\nstandards and award credit for mastery of those competencies, but doesn\u2019t\nmandate how report cards or evaluations should look, she said. That means\ndistricts must spend time researching the model, training teachers, fine-\ntuning assessment practices and doing outreach in the community before taking\nthe leap.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cdrop-dead\u201d deadline to complete the shift, Couch said, because the\nstate recognizes that such a shift takes time.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want is for everybody to feel comfortable with it and be able\nto do it well. The end game is that everybody is like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re fully in,\nbecause we\u2019re ready to be fully in,\u2019 \u201d Couch said. \u201c\u2026 And we don\u2019t want to be\nthe deciders of when that happens.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a process that takes years. Even in early-adopting schools like Sanborn\nand Stevens, where this work has likewise been going on for close to a decade,\nthe change is incremental, and bigger shifts are still in the future.\n\nLocal schools similarly land at different stages on the spectrum. Some, such\nas [Keene High\nSchool](http://khs.keeneschoolsnh.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=1462014&type=d&pREC_ID=1458469)\nand the [Jaffrey-Rindge Cooperative School\nDistrict](http://www.sau47.org/learning-progressions-links), have begun to\nmake changes to grading and assessment. In Jaffrey-Rindge, new grading\nprotocols were rolled out in fall 2018, with work habits \u2014 including\ncompletion of homework \u2014 rated separately from the academic grade on a 1 to 4\nscale.\n\nKeene High [will begin separately reporting work habits this\nfall](https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/keene-high-to-forgo-finals-in-\nshift-to-competency-based/article_48f36894-312a-5e1c-ac48-6e83d67e8c3e.html),\nin addition to eliminating midterms and final exams. Grades will instead be\nbased on \u201cformative\u201d assessments like homework, quizzes and reading checks and\n\u201csummative\u201d assessments, such as projects, presentations and essays, the\nlatter of which students will be able to redo if they don\u2019t show proficiency\nthe first time.\n\nThe Hinsdale School District already separates work habits from academic\nscores at all levels, according to Karen Craig, director of curriculum,\ninstruction and assessment. The district also uses competency-based report\ncards that forego letter grades in kindergarten through 6th grade. That\u2019s been\nin place at the elementary school for roughly five years, she said, and the\ndistrict plans to continue phasing in this type of reporting in the upper\ngrades, starting with 7th grade this year.\n\nHinsdale\u2019s robust [extended learning opportunity\nprogram](https://www.sentinelsource.com/features/education/quick_studies/time-\nto-shine-hinsdale-exhibition-showcases-real-world-\nlearning/article_c4572eb7-1f68-54ef-9762-7557ddf401a9.html), which offers\nacademic credit for internships, apprenticeships and independent study\ncourses, has also been praised as an example in work-based learning \u2014 the\nprogram\u2019s leader, Karen Thompson, was named the state\u2019s ELO Coordinator of the\nYear in 2018.\n\nOther districts, such as the Monadnock Regional School District, are at an\nearlier phase in the process. The district has been exploring competency-based\neducation for about five years and has introduced a standards-based report\ncard for grades K-6, according to Jeremy Rathbun, director of curriculum,\ninstruction and assessment. But he said rolling out assessment and reporting\nchanges to the middle and high school is still down the road.\n\nThe district plans to begin outreach in the community this year to gather\nfeedback on how grades should be reported under the competency-based model,\nRathbun said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working through it so that when we\u2019re ready to talk to parents about\nit, we know exactly what we want, and what it looks like,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some communities, changes have not gone without criticism. In both\n[Keene](https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/keene-school-district-\ngrappling-with-education-change/article_ddb25bcf-fd0f-54f5-94be-\ndab6bec1ea7e.html) and [Jaffrey-\nRindge](https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/for-many-in-jaffrey-rindge-\ndistrict-new-assessment-system-\ndoesn/article_127f0826-ca60-558d-b283-3de3acee3a68.html), some parents have\npushed back against the model, raising concerns about college acceptance and\nstudent accountability.\n\nFor those who grew up in a traditional education system \u2014 and who rightly care\na great deal about their children\u2019s futures \u2014 the change in philosophy can be\ndifficult, educators say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely understandable sort of reaction to anything that might\nchange in that area,\u201d said David Dustin, assistant principal of curriculum,\ninstruction and assessment at Jaffrey-Rindge Middle School and Conant High\nSchool in Jaffrey.\n\nEducators in districts further along in the process stressed that parents,\nteachers and students need to be an integral part of the conversation \u2014 but\nmost said that some level of anxiety and concern surrounding the shift is\ninevitable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one way to do competency-based, and each school and community has\nto figure out what works for them. It\u2019s absolutely critical, based on what\nI\u2019ve witnessed here in Claremont, that the parents be a part of the\nconversation from the very beginning,\u201d Barry said. \u201cAnd if the system that you\nimplement doesn\u2019t provide the information that the parents want and need, then\nit\u2019s not a good system.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Stevens is taking a second look at its grading scale using feedback\nfrom parents, students and faculty, Barry said, with the ultimate goal of\nmaking sure the scale provides an accurate picture of students\u2019 progress.\n\nStack similarly noted that shifting to competency-based education is a\nconstant process of re-evaluating and trying to improve the systems by which\nstudents are taught. And while the community has grown more accustomed to many\nof the changes at Sanborn since they were first implemented, he said there is\nstill work to be done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find our identity here, just like every other school\nthat\u2019s trying to be competency-based is, because that\u2019s going to be when it\nbecomes part of their culture,\u201d Stack said. \u201cAnd then people are going to come\nto expect that that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nMeg McIntyre can be reached at 352-1234, extension 1404, or\n[mmcintyre@keenesentinel.com](mailto:mmcintyre@keenesentinel.com).

Col. Jamie Wiley, AETC occupational competencies branch\nchief. \"Our goal has been to create a scalable, repeatable model that can be\nused to develop Airmen across their entire career, not just within the formal\ntraining environment or professional military education.\"  \n  \nCompetency models can help a career field across the force development and\ntalent management spectrum through recruiting and selecting individuals who\npossess the attributes needed to succeed in the career field, Wiley said.  \n  \n\"The models assist with training and developing individuals so the learner\nexperience is more effective and the rate of decay for perishable knowledge\nand skills is reduced,\" Wiley said. \"They also help assess performance and job\nprogression objectively, as well as guide potential promotion and\ndevelopmental opportunities.\"  \n  \nAnother benefit of occupational modeling is it aids succession planning in\nthat the right people are vectored into the right positions through the\ntransparency of what is required for job success, Wiley said.  \n  \nTo understand why competencies are needed to deliberately grow and develop\nAirmen throughout their careers, one only needs to think about what it is that\ndistinguishes a top-performing Airman from an average one.  \n  \n\"You don't think about the tasks that make an Airman a top performer; I highly\ndoubt you think about tasks like how well they know definitions or how they\nbuild a document,\" said Vincent Villanueva, AETC occupational competencies\ndeputy branch chief. \"We just don't think in those terms; we think of the\nbehaviors that make that Airman a top performer. The competencies tie the\ntasks together with specific behaviors that produce a top performing Airman.\"  \n  \nCompetencies also link directly to an Airman's professional development and\n[Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein](https://www.af.mil/About-\nUs/Biographies/Display/Article/108013/general-david-l-goldfein/)'s focus area\nof revitalizing squadrons.  \n  \n\"Competencies get to the heart of making the force ready and lay the\nfoundation for force development, tying directly into the profession of arms\nand making Airmen more well-rounded,\" Villanueva said. \"Additionally, career\nfields can use these competencies to give them time back, which talks directly\nto revitalizing squadrons.\"  \n  \nTo build a competency model, the team looks at task-based knowledge and skills\nand combines them with other behaviors and soft skills such as teamwork,\ncritical thinking, self-control, resiliency, leadership and stress management\nthat ultimately lead to behavior-based outcomes, Villanueva said.  \n  \n\"Understanding these competencies allows our instructors in the formal\ntraining environment to left-load that soft-skill training into their\ncurriculum development, helping the career field start building leaders\nearlier in their careers,\" Villanueva said.  \n  \nThe goal to have a scalable, repeatable, competency-based model in place was\nJune 2020, which the team shattered.  \n  \n\"We've already met our initial goal,\" Wiley said. \"We held our first career-\nfield manager brief in November 2018, and the team's first study was in\nFebruary of this year. So far 22 career fields are in some phase of competency\nmodel development.\"  \n  \nCross-functional teams are being used to build common competency models for\nAir Force specialty codes that represent diverse career fields, such as pilots\nand aircraft maintenance specialties, Wiley said.  \n  \nTo learn more about occupational competency model development and\nimplementation, check out the \"Developing Mach-21 Airmen\" podcast featuring a\nconversation with Wiley and Villanueva.\n\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)AFWN](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/134959/afwn/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)USAF](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/12308/usaf/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)AF](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/865/af/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)Air\nForce](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/37/air-force/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)AETC](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/821/aetc/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)Air Education and\nTraining Command](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/2016/air-education-and-training-\ncommand/) [![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)Advance\nForce Development](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/149282/advance-force-\ndevelopment/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)Occupational\nCompetencies](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/149281/occupational-competencies/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)Career Field\nManager](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/131677/career-field-manager/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)learning\nmodel](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/151162/learning-model/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)force\ndevelopment](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/11352/force-development/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)JB San Antonio-\nRandolph](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/80668/jb-san-antonio-randolph/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)talent](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/53408/talent/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)recruiting](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/353/recruiting/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)modeling](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/124826/modeling/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)mission](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/149/mission/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)vision](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/1173/vision/)\n[![Tag](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/AirForce2/tag.png)priorities](http://www.af.mil/News/Tag/2890/priorities/)\n\n## Engage\n\nFacebook Twitter\n\n[![Logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/875377950861950976/WDv6YJ5d_normal.jpg)](https://www.twitter.com/@usairforce)\n\n[U.S. Air Force](https://twitter.com/19611483/statuses/1247738535333040128)  \n[@@usairforce](https://www.twitter.com/@usairforce)-08 Apr\n\n[@AFSpecOpsCmd](https://twitter.com/AFSpecOpsCmd)'s 352d Special Operations\nWing deployed to Norway to participate in exercise Cold Response 2020, whic\u2026\n<https://t.co/rqrkvSVwfp>\n\n[![Logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/875377950861950976/WDv6YJ5d_normal.jpg)](https://www.twitter.com/@usairforce)\n\n[U.S. Air Force](https://twitter.com/19611483/statuses/1247625699055276033)  \n[@@usairforce](https://www.twitter.com/@usairforce)-07 Apr\n\nRT [@NORADCommand](https://twitter.com/NORADCommand):\n[#NORAD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NORAD) remains prepared to respond to\nsecurity threats.
