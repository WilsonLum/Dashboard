Suite\nLaunched by IndiaFilings.com**\n\n# ConqHR HR Suite Launched by IndiaFilings.com\n\nPosted By: [](https://www.socialnews.xyz/author/) January 13, 2020\n\n**Business Wire India**[IndiaFilings.com](https://www.indiafilings.com/) the\nlargest cloud-based business services platform, has unveiled a new HR suite\ncalled [ConqHR](https://conqhr.com/) (pronounced Conquer). The company which\nbegan in 2014 offering incorporation services has over the last five years\nexpanded its service offering to include GST, business tax filing, payroll\nprocessing, incorporation services and trademark filing.  \n  \nWith the launch of the ConqHR HR suite, the company hopes to help tens of\nthousands of businesses in India streamline their HR processes. Speaking at\nthe product launch event, Lionel Charles - CEO of IndiaFilings said \"We are\nexcited to launch ConqHR in continuation to LEDGERS software. With the launch\nof ConqHR, we continue to evolve as a product company and look forward to\nreleasing a brand new platform for helping millions of taxpayers save taxes in\nthe upcoming month.  \n  \n**HR Management a Challenge for SMEs**  \nIndia has over 55 million small businesses of various sizes. Of the 55 million\nsmall businesses, a good portion of small businesses employ various staff and\nwould be required to process payroll each month and comply with regulations\nsuch as ESI, PF and TDS. Currently, the business owner takes responsibility\nfor payroll processing in most cases and process the same using tools like\nExcel - manually.  \n  \nProcessing of payroll manually with minimal experience can lead to errors and\nnon-compliance issues. To avoid such hassles - a cloud-based HR suite like\nConqHR can be implemented by SME owners to simplify, automate and streamline\nthe entire process.  \n  \n**Automating HR management using ConqHR**  \nImplementing ConqHR in a small business can help the business owner automate\nmany of the mundane tasks associated with HR management like:\n\n  1. Employee onboarding\n  2. Leave management\n  3. Attendance management\n  4. Payroll processing\n  5. Payroll disbursement\n  6. HR compliance\n  7. TDS filing\n  8. ESI filing\n  9. PF filing\n  10. Exit management\n  11. Performance review and monitoring\n  12. Asset management\n\nConqHR HR suite is completely customisable and can be setup to suit the\nrequirement for a business of any size - having any number or branches or\nemployees. Once setup, the suite manages various aspects of HR management and\nprovides various insights to the business owner to maintain a healthy\nemployer-employee relationship. For example, the system can detect overworked\nor underworked employees based on various datapoints and also suggest periodic\nsalary increments based on the company's HR policies.  \n  \n**Integrated Recruitment Software**  \nIn addition to HR management modules, ConqHR also has an inbuilt Applicant\nTracking System called RecruitHR. With RecruitHR, the business owner can\nautomate the entire process of discovery of potential candidates, first\nengagement, interview and onboarding. ConqHR and RecruitHR work in an\nintegrated fashion to provide the business owner with a comprehensive HR\nsolution.  \n  \n**LEDGERS**  \nLast year the company also unveiled [LEDGERS](https://ledgers.cloud/) Software\nto help businesses issue invoices, track purchases, file their GST returns and\nmaintain their compliance online. LEDGERS platform is linked with the GST\nNetwork and GST return filing in the government's portal can be done\nseamlessly based on the invoices generated or uploaded on the platform. Over\n50 thousand businesses now use LEDGERS and the company is targetting to\nincrease the user base further.![ConqHR HR Suite Launched

In addition,\nthe IDEMIA Group is also considering the creation of a new _Digital_ business\nunit within the SET division.\n\n\n\n**The new division will be led by Pierre Barrial, who previously managed\nIDEMIA 's _Financial Institutions_ business unit.**\n\n\n\nIDEMIA's customers, i.e. banks, fintech firms, telecoms operators, smartphone\nmanufacturers, IoT firms and automotive manufacturers, are rising to the\nchallenge of managing online services and getting digital. Against such a\nbackdrop, while IDEMIA will continue to develop its long-time expertise in\ncutting-edge technologies such as cryptography, artificial intelligence,\nbiometrics or cloud communications, the new SET division will deliver\nconnectivity, payment and identity solutions as customers require under a\nrevamped offering that guarantees IDEMIA's services efficiency, fluidity and\nsecurity. By creating the new SET division, IDEMIA will streamline its\nstructure so as to foster a far-reaching Group vision that will give customers\nfurther growth opportunities on new markets.\n\n\n\nIDEMIA CEO Yann Delabriere said: \" _As market leader, we harness technologies\nthat are crucial for digital, the new reality, i.e. secure connectivity\nmanagement, secure payments and secure identity management. The new SET\ndivision will support customers as they go digital while continuing to provide\nvalue-enhancing and trail-blazing services for their traditional operations.\nPierre Barrial is a top class business manager and I have no doubt at all he\nwill be a complete success in his new job. \"_\n\n\n\nAmanda Gourbault, who used to be Senior Vice President Financial Institutions\nGlobal Sales and Commercial Processes, will take over from Pierre Barrial as\nExecutive Vice President Financial Institutions. She will also sit on the\nIDEMIA executive committee.\n\n\n\nFabien Jautard and Yves Portalier will keep managing, the _Mobile Operators_\nand _Connected Objects_ business units respectively as Executive Vice\nPresidents and members of the Group executive committee.\n\n\n\nThe _Connected Objects_ business unit will henceforth take over IDEMIA's\nbiometric devices activities.\n\n\n\nAll the above appointments take effect immediately.\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n**About IDEMIA**\n\n\n\nIDEMIA, the global leader in Augmented Identity, provides a trusted\nenvironment enabling citizens and consumers alike to perform their daily\ncritical activities (such as pay, connect, travel and vote), in the physical\nas well as digital space.\n\n\n\nSecuring our identity has become mission critical in the world we live in\ntoday.
