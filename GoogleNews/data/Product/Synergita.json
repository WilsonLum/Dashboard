The\nintroduction of \u2018Employee Promotion\u2019 feature will help team leaders to\nnominate employees for appraisal, review assessments, approve processes and\nannounce promotions to the team members on the app.\n\nAnother innovative and timely addition to the mobile-app is Continuous\nFeedback Tagging Goals which will enable team members, peers and leaders to\nshare their action plans, objectives and key results, progress and\nconversations around the employee goals to drive collaboration and team\neffort. This feature will allow open feedback culture and boosts employees\u2019\nperformance and productivity.\n\nAn easy to use feature added to the app is voiceMAGIC. Continuous feedback\nessentially is sharing inputs, comments, appreciations and initiating a\ndiscussion on specific goals. To make giving feedback a lot easier, Synergita\nhas introduced voice-tech enabled continuous feedback and CORE value rating.\nThe advanced speech recognition algorithm will translate speech to error-free\nnotes which can be instantly shared with peers.\n\nShankar Krishnamoorthy, the CEO of Synergita, says, \u201cPerformance management is\nnot only a retrospective analysis but also a roadmap for future growth. Going\ndigital will help companies analyze and reinvent their employee performance,\ndevelopment, and collaboration process effectively.

Though [**employee performance\nmanagement**](https://www.synergita.com/) comprises employee engagement,\ndevelopment and performance appraisal, it is largely synonymous with\nperformance appraisal.\n\n  \n\nLegacy companies with the traditional hierarchical structure as well as\nmodern, hi-tech companies with flat structure both are alike in moving away\nfrom the \"once a year report card\" format of employee appraisal. And are\nreconcile with the fact that they can't do away with it. HR leaders are\ndiscovering new methods and approaches to make performance management people-\ncentric and productive. They want their new methods to be development focused,\nhelpful for ongoing projects/tasks rather than a previous year's performance\nanalysis.\n\n  \n\nThe silver lining here is the options are endless and can be innovatively\ncustomizable to suit your people and business.\n\n  \n\n**First Set: Set your eyes on the right objectives**\n\n  \n\nBefore designing our performance management strategies, it is better to set\nour objectives and expectations right. What you want to accomplish for your\nemployees, managers, HRs and company with this new performance process\n\n  \n\n **Objectives for Employees - Development & Growth**\n\n  \n\nEmployees are your biggest asset and the committed co-author for writing your\ngrowth story. The performance management need not be just evaluative in nature\nbut focus more on bringing out their true potential. It should serve their\ndevelopment needs, identify their strengths, weaknesses, and proactive in\nfilling the skill gaps or playing to their strength.\n\nThe only thing that's worse than training your employees and then having them\nLEAVE is not training them and having them STAY. - Zig Ziglar\n\n  \n\n **Objectives for Team Managers - Collaboration & coaching**\n\n  \n\nManagers are responsible for the timelines and quality of deliverables. They\nmotivate and coach employees, guide them earnestly and lead one and all to the\nsuccessful completion of the job. They need the right set of information and\ntools to watch out for trials and triumphs.\n\nManagers need to step-in to provide constructive feedback to employees when\nrequired or recognize their achievements instantly to cheer them. Continuous\nfeedback enabled performance management tool empowers managers to have\ncontinuous collaboration, performance conversation and share instant\nappreciation with the team.\n\n  \n\n **Objectives for People Managers - Engagement & simplified process**\n\n  \n\n **** For HRs, performance management is both human-centric and metrics-\ndriven. They want to drive [**employee\nengagement**](https://www.synergita.com/features/employee-engagement-\nsurvey.html/) and enhance employee experience with modern practices. It helps\nthem improve their retention rate and builds an impressive brand image to\nattract new hires.\n\nAlso, they want to have precise performance metrics- the highs and lows,\nrating distribution, employee engagement level to create short and long-term\nHR roadmaps. For this, HR teams need instant and easily accessible analytics\nreports.  Several HR reports should be made available to them without manual\nefforts - like collating papers, crunching the numbers and so on. The new\nperformance management process combined with digitization should simplify and\nspeed up their tasks.\n\n  \n\n**Objectives for Organization - Productivity & Bottom line**\n\n  \n\nA company as an entity thrives only when it operates profitably. Productivity\ndepends on the people who work there and how engaged they are in their work.\nContinuous performance conversation, collaboration within the team, employee\nengagement and development are the prime factors that directly affect\nproductivity. Your performance management strategies should comprise all these\nto improve the bottom line.\n\n  \n\n **Second Step: Identify a tool with the right set of features**\n\n  \n\nOnce you have finalized your objectives for all the stakeholders, the next\nstep involves finding the right tool that serves your objectives. Do your\ndiligent research on the products available in the market, compare and analyze\nyour findings.\n\n  \n\nA comprehensive HR suite may fit your purpose or niche performance management\nsoftware that can be integrated with your existing HRIS gives more\ncapabilities. Weigh your options thoroughly and choose wisely considering all\nthe present and future needs.\n\n  \n\nFollowing are some niche features that are worth considering:\n\n  \n\n  * Comprehensive goals and competency management with matrix structure gives better flexibility in a non-linear organizational hierarchy\n  * 360-degree feedback feature with options to include external stakeholders such as customers, vendors\n  * Categorization of continuous feedback such as appreciation, tagging to specific employee goal, and confidential notes\n  * Employee development initiatives such as skill training recommendations\n  * Flexible to conduct multiple reviews either monthly, quarterly or more for continuous performance management\n  * Value-added capabilities such as finding HiPo employees, deploying independent employee pulse surveys and other features that raise the bar\n  * Mobile App for easy anytime, anywhere access\n  * Some AI features don't hurt if it fits within your budget\n\n  \n\n **Third Step: Prepare a systematic initiation plan**\n\n  \n\nYour careful planning and the perfect software don't hit the mark if the\nchange management doesn't deliver. Create a top-down or bottom-up approach\nthat suits you well, to induct the new employee performance management process\nand software. For instance, if your process includes continuous feedback\nfeature, then create a right open culture that facilitates the free exchange\nof constructive feedback and appreciation.\n\n  \n\nLittle strokes fell great oaks; with persistent and continuous campaigning and\npractice you can successfully integrate your process efficiently into your\norganization.\n\nEach step is as important as the next in your strategic HR management. Your\nmeticulous planning and execution is the only ally in this combat and helps\nyou put up the victory banner in the end.\n\n  \n\nTake your first step today!\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

[Reflektive](https://www.reflektive.com/) aims to replace\nthe typically painful review process with a far more lightweight and less\ndemotivating real-time feedback system that integrates into an employee's\ndaily workflow. In 2015, the company raised a [$3.6 million seed\nround](https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/reflektive-raises-3-6-million-\nfrom-andreessen-horowitz-to-rethink-annual-performance-reviews/) led by\nAndreessen Horowitz, followed by a $13 million Series A round in 2016 led by\nLightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nToday, the company announced that it has raised an additional $25 million in a\nSeries B round that was once again led by Lightspeed. Andreessen Horowitz also\nparticipated in this round.\n\n[Reflektive's current ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/reflektive)\ncustomers include companies like Twilio, Braintree, Thumbtack, CreditKarma,\nDigital Ocean, Udacity, and Nutanix. In total, Reflektive now has about 200\ncustomers, up from 70 compared to a year ago. This kind of growth, as well as\nthe fact that it is tackling a problem that virtually anybody who has ever\nworked for a large company can relate to, is clearly attractive to investors.\n\nReflektive CEO and founder Rajeev Behera notes in today's announcement that\nthe company had a lot of interest in this round but decided to go with an\ninside round led by Lightspeed's Nakul Mandan.\n\n\"In the age of LinkedIn and Glassdoor, business leaders can\u2019t afford to have\ndisengaged employees and can\u2019t impose HR processes that are more\nadministrative in nature vs. genuinely focused on talent development,\" Mandan\nsaid in a statement. \"The team at Reflektive has built a beautiful solution\nthat helps managers and employees provide each other real-time feedback, help\nin each other\u2019s development and stay connected with the company\u2019s mission.\nReflektive\u2019s fast growth and the marquee customer list speaks to how well\ntheir solution is resonating with business leaders.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are a few other companies that are also vying for this\nmarket. These include the likes of\n[BetterWorks](https://www.betterworks.com/performance-management/),\n[ZingHR](https://www.zinghr.com/), [Synergita](https://www.synergita.com/) and\nplenty of others, though they all tend to have slightly different features and\nemphasize different parts of the employee review and retention process.\n\nBehera says that the new funding will now allow his company to expand to new\nproducts that will focus on continuous employee feedback and communication, as\nwell as real-time personalized employee engagement.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Here's what you need to know about career development and HR technology - People Matters", "link": "https://www.peoplematters.in/article/technology/how-do-the-professionals-need-to-keep-track-of-the-evolving-hr-tech-18389", "guid": "CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlb3BsZW1hdHRlcnMuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2hvdy1kby10aGUtcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFscy1uZWVkLXRvLWtlZXAtdHJhY2stb2YtdGhlLWV2b2x2aW5nLWhyLXRlY2gtMTgzODnSAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW9wbGVtYXR0ZXJzLmluL2FtcC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWhvdy1kby10aGUtcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFscy1uZWVkLXRvLWtlZXAtdHJhY2stb2YtdGhlLWV2b2x2aW5nLWhyLXRlY2gtMTgzODk", "pubdate": "Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.peoplematters.in/article/technology/how-do-the-professionals-need-to-keep-track-of-the-evolving-hr-tech-18389\" target=\"_blank\">Here's what you need to know about career development and HR technology</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">People Matters</font>", "source": "People Matters", "body": "Account _ _\n\n  * [Login](/login)\n  * [Subscribe](/account/subscribe)\n\n  *   * [__](/newsletter/subscribe \"Subscribe to our newsletter\")\n  * [Login](/login)\n  * [Subscribe](/account/subscribe)\n\n  * __\n\n[ ![People Matters' Digital Platforms](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_728,h_90,c_fill/v1585634773/ad-b2fq1bkr.gif)\n](/?__utm=b2fq1bkr&__utm_medium=articles%2Fread&__utm_index=6 \"People Matters'\nDigital Platforms\")\n\n[ People Matters ![People Matters](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/h_88,w_188,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/Logo-2.0.jpg) ](/)\n\n  * Hot Topics \n    * [GetSetLearn](/brand-reachout/get-set-learn)\n    * [Design Thinking HR](/brand-reachout/design-thinking-hr)\n    * [HR Learning Center](/Campaign-Aon-AHLC-journeys)\n\n  * Media \n    * [Videos](/videos/index)\n    * [Events](/events/index)\n    * [News](/news/index)\n    * [Infographics](/tag/infographics)\n    * [Research](/posts-research)\n    * [Magazine](/hr-magazine/2020)\n\n  * Hot Topics \n  * |\n  * [GetSetLearn](/brand-reachout/get-set-learn)\n  * |\n  * [Design Thinking HR](/brand-reachout/design-thinking-hr)\n  * |\n  * [HR Learning Center](/Campaign-Aon-AHLC-journeys)\n\n  * Media \n  * |\n  * [Videos](/videos/index)\n  * |\n  * [Events](/events/index)\n  * |\n  * [News](/news/index)\n  * |\n  * [Infographics](/tag/infographics)\n  * |\n  * [Research](/posts-research)\n  * |\n  * [Magazine](/hr-magazine/2020)\n\n# Article: Here's what you need to know about career development and HR\ntechnology\n\n  * [![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-matters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1473662465/authors/amol-pawar.jpg)AUTHORAmol Pawar](/author/amol-pawar?utm_source=story_nav&utm_medium=author_link&utm_content=Amol+Pawar&utm_campaign=author_track&utm_term=click \"Posted by: Amol Pawar\")\n  * WEDNESDAY30MAY 2018\n  * 5.3KREADS\n\n[Technology](/category/technology-\noutsourcing/technology?utm_content=technology \"Browse more in: Technology\")\n\n# Here's what you need to know about career development and HR technology\n\nThe expectation of skills and expertise required for a particular profession\nare changing dramatically across all domains. How is this affecting the career\npaths of professionals?\n\n![Here&#039;s what you need to know about career development and HR\ntechnology](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1527596945/1527596822.jpg)\n\nOne of the common benefits that most employees look for in organizations is\nthe ability of the organization to provide a long-term career. In the 21st\ncentury, however, the notion of career and career paths is undergoing a sea\nchange primarily due to social, economical and technological factors. This is\nalso evident in the recently published Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends\nSurvey which clearly identified \"building 21st century career\" as third most\nimportant trend with almost 50 percent of respondents describing it as very\nimportant, however only about 10 percent felt they were very ready to address\nthis particular trend, demonstrating how urgent and important is this\nchallenge.\n\nFundamentally, the notion that you study for 10-15 years and then reap the\nbenefits by sticking to the career choice you made for next 30-40 years is\nlargely being questioned. The expectation of skills and expertise required for\na particular profession are changing dramatically across all domains. For\nexample, even though you may remain a lawyer practicing a particular type of\nlaw throughout your career today, the skills and expertise required to perform\nthat task would change and evolve over a period of time. Your ability to adapt\nto these changing needs, primarily driven by technological innovation and\nevolution, will determine the monetary and psychological rewards you gain from\nsuch a career.\n\nThe 4 global macroeconomic trends that seem to be driving the war on talent as\ndescribed by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic in his book \" _The Talent Delusion_ \"\nare:\n\n  1. The disengagement epidemic  \n  \n\n  2. The rise of passive job seeker  \n  \n\n  3. The growing appeal of self-employment   \n  \n\n  4. The rise of entrepreneurship  \n  \n\nHe effectively argues that hence, the war is not for talent, but is on talent,\nas organizations need to design effective and efficient processes that attract\nthe right kind of talent instead of repelling them.\n\nThe key anomaly in most organizational definition of career paths is that they\nare linked to organizational hierarchy and hence, the development efforts are\nalso aligned with the same. In reality, career paths are most likely to not\nfollow organizational hierarchy even in organizations where they are defined\nbased on hierarchy. This is coming increasingly under pressure with the\nexpected rise of gig workers in the workplace and changing expectations of a\nmix of workforce across 3 or 4 different generations.\n\n### The building blocks of new age career development\n\n  1. _Jobs and their definition  \n  \n_ As companies adopt and adapt to digital business models in their industries,\nthe jobs being performed to achieve specific objectives are being re-designed\ndramatically. McKinsey [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-\ninsights/future-of-organizations-and-work/Jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-\nfuture-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) predicts that 60 percent\nof occupations have at least 30 percent of constituent work activities that\ncould be automated. Use of automation and artificial intelligence is likely to\nbecome mainstream and it is most likely to create occupations and jobs that do\nnot exist today.  \n\n> As companies redesign existing jobs and introduce newly designed jobs, they\n> will continue to struggle to define a path for individuals to move from\n> place A to B.\n\n  \nThe above gets further complicated with more and more \"senior\" roles becoming\nwhat is called as \"hybrid\" jobs, where just having a particular domain or\ntechnology expertise is not enough, the importance of softer skills is ever\nmore important in these jobs. This presents a critical design challenge for\ncompanies when they look at these multiple jobs from the view of defining\nmultiple career paths or options for employees.  \n  \n\n  2. _Learning    \n  \n_As companies evolve their digital business models and redesign the jobs, the\nnext logical fall out of that are the learning gaps these new jobs created\nwith respect to existing employees or future employees. It is one thing to say\nwe want to use artificial intelligence in our business operations and another\nto be able to find or train relevant employees with necessary domain and\nindustry experience in these skills.  \n  \nCompanies world over are increasingly looking to redesign the way learning is\npresented and consumed by their employees and the focus seems to be moving on\nbuilding specific skills via crowd-sourced platforms either internally or\nexternally.  \n  \nAligning such wide variety of content to internal jobs and realities is the\nmost critical aspect of this journey to ensure that learning is relevant to\nthe overall career growth of the individual.  \n  \n\n  3. _Performance management  \n  \n_ In recent past, many companies have moved from the annual performance\nreviews to a continuous feedback culture and this trend seems to become the\ndefault performance management approach in many progressive global\norganizations. Yet companies seem to struggle to balance the conversation with\nimmediate performance and long-term career orientation. Companies are in a\ndifficult situation here as they need to strike the right balance between\nensuring effective performances in the short term while also being able to\nprovide an engaging picture of the future for the [performing employees\n](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-organizations-and-\nwork/Jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-\nand-wages)to consider staying put for that future to realize. How companies\nuse the crowdsourced data along with coaching at scale to effectively maneuver\nthese conversations is a key task in an effective career development\nframework.  \n  \n\n  4. _Data and analytics  \n  \n_ Use of data and analytics particularly in HR decision making has started to\ngain prominence in recent years and just like the 3 aspects mentioned above,\nthis has fundamentally changed how individuals and companies will look at\ncareer path or career growth. Companies are increasingly looking to use data\nto make people decisions and with the ever-increasing use of technology, there\nis more and more data that is at the disposal of companies. Companies can look\nto leverage these insights to design unique career paths or even providing\nthese insights and tools to employees to help them create their own career\npaths thus improving transparency of decision making, a key component of a\nsuccessful 21st-century enterprise.\n\n### The technology solutions landscape\n\nThe technology solution landscape for this critical business and HR imperative\nis evolving and we continue to see emergence of solutions which are helping\ncompanies tackle one of the challenges, while some HR technology companies are\nattempting to target all the building blocks, however increasingly the problem\nof designing efficient career paths is going to be multi-disciplinary and\nhence would require multiple technological solutions to interact with each\nother to provide the real solution to this business problem. We now look at\nsome of the specific HR technology solutions that help companies solve this\nproblem.\n\n### The point solutions:\n\nFuel50, TalentGuard, Praditus, MentorCloud, Unibly, PathSavvy, and SmashPath\nare some of the examples of [HR\nTechnology](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-industry/hr-tech-\nlandscape-the-growing-ecosystem-of-service-providers-18074) solutions that are\navailable today which help address either the entire career development\nprocess or certain parts of it. In most performance management point solutions\nlike BetterWorks, Synergita, Zugata, Relfektive, Impraise and QiloTech among\nothers offer some sort of developmental needs identification, however many\nperformance management software solutions do not offer any career guidance or\ncareer path related elements.\n\nThe other critical aspect that determines the attractiveness of a career is a\nseries of exciting jobs that are possibly available in the company. Currently,\nwe do not see any point or otherwise solution being offered in this space. The\npotential solution in this area can help companies map potential paths based\non historic employee data of promotions or movements across geographies and\nroles. It could also help companies design better jobs based on their context\nand help them compare with peers in similar industries. Tools like Textio are\nattempting to help companies write better job descriptions but that is just 1\ntiny aspect of a good job design and typically comes pretty late in the job\ndesign process.\n\nMost of the above-described point solutions will need to be integrated with\nother HR systems like core HR, performance management, and learning\nmanagement, thus creating a challenge for the HR technology buyer as they\nwould have to worry about integration points and effective use of data\ngenerated in all point solutions across the career path process.\n\nOne category within the career path process that seems to have exploded in the\nrecent past and we believe it will continue to grow in learning. We now have a\nmarketplace of next-generation learning management systems, learning\nexperience platforms, micro-learning platforms, MOOC and Program management\nsystems and a new set of virtual reality enabled assessment tools, all coming\ntogether in this space. Companies like Degreed, Udacity, EdCast, UpGrad, Fuse,\nGrovo and Pluralsight are some of the examples of companies in the above-\nmentioned categories within learning management. Thus presenting subcategories\nwithin a subcategory of career path solutions.\n\nThe Data Analytics is a fast emerging category within HR tech space and HR\nTechnology buyers struggle today to choose between embedded analytics from\npoint solution providers and using a specialized analytics solution. In case\nof career path design and deployment, currently, it looks like a hybrid model\nwhere HR leaders will have to leverage data from the existing point and other\nsolutions and design an integrated data-driven career development approach\nusing a specialized tool like Visier.\n\n### The talent management suites\n\nTypically most large enterprise HCM applications have talent management\nsolutions as part of their suite and most players like Oracle, SAP, Workday,\nCeridian, PageUP will offer these as part of their solution sets. However,\ndepending on the HCM solution provider what they offer under talent management\nwill vary greatly, while most tend to offer Performance management and\nlearning management solutions which may or may not support a career\ndevelopment or career path oriented approach.\n\n### The Indian scenario\n\nWe haven't come across any Indian company offering a point solution in career\ndevelopment space. However, players like Ramco and Adrenalin seem to offer\nmost of the building blocks for a career development model while some other\nHCM solution providers like Darwinbox and PeopleWorks offer only parts of the\ncareer path solutions as part of their HCM suite. We see great potential for\nthese and other players to re-think their solution sets from a career\ndevelopment stand-point and be able to create an attractive value proposition\nfor buyers in India and outside.\n\n### In conclusion\n\nSuccessful organizations are able to provide tailored solutions that empower\nindividuals to reinvent themselves within the company. This is critical for\nsuccess in the 21st century for both employees and employers to be able to\nnavigate the complex and hybrid nature of work we seem to encounter.\n\nCompanies like Shell operate with a belief that\n[investment](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-industry/how-does-shell-\nenable-employees-to-be-most-authentic-versions-18236) in individual\ndevelopment not only contributes to their personal growth, but also to the\ngrowth of the business and has created a unique model of employee development\ntailored to their context.\n\nWhen effective programs like these are designed to engage and enable employees\nto find, pursue and excel in the kind of experiences they wish to pursue for\ntheir growth; it creates a virtuous cycle of benefits for both employees and\norganizations. Such programs can help individuals and organizations meet the\ncurrent and future demands of work. The technology landscape will need to\nevolve and help organizations create their unique solutions in this pursuit.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:

Hence to\nensure they are performing to your expectations, you need to gauge your\nemployees\u2019 annual performance.\n\nEvaluating employee performance can give you a number of metrics that can\nquickly reveal how someone is doing. It is also an excellent way to figure out\nthe negative points and create an action plan to turn things around.\n\nNot convinced? Here are some more reasons why you should evaluate employee\nperformance.\n\n**Reason 1: To Get a Clear Picture Of What Each Employee Is Doing**\n\nBy analyzing the performance of every employee, you will get to know about\ntheir participation in the company\u2019s vision. This will give you a view of\nwhether an employee is prepared for the greater responsibility. There may be\nmultiple candidates, who are vying for promotion, but through performance\nevaluation, you can screen the one with outstanding achievement and\nprofessional readiness.\n\n**Reason 2: To Screen the Star Performers**\n\nThe employee performance evaluation also enables you to figure out the amazing\nemployees in your organization. There may be some out-of-the-box overachievers\nwho need to be appreciated. You can put additional focus on their development\nto improve your business.\n\n**Reason 3: To Discover the Training Needs**\n\nEver wondered why some employees struggle with the tasks and lag behind\nquotas? This may be due to the quality of training they received. If you\nneglect such issue, you are likely to jeopardize your company's attainment of\nits goals.\n\nEmployee performance evaluation can reveal such training needs. Remember,\nevery player in a team should perform in peak condition to win and performance\nevaluation is a great way to ensure that. You need to elevate individual self-\nesteem and groom the week performer to bring the best out of them.\n\n**Reason 4: To Set New Goals**\n\nThe performance evaluation of employees will also help you determine the\nkeyholes in your business. Using annual reviews, you can set new goals for\nyour organization. For instance, if you find most of your employees are not\ndoing well, you can work on their improvement and find a better way to\nmotivate them.\n\n**Reason 5: Employees Will Know Where They Stand**\n\nYour employees may not have any idea of how they\u2019re doing. Ongoing development\nis a core mandate even for small start-ups. The work pressure may not allow\nyou to give constant feedback. However, a formal work evaluation program can\nhelp the employees to stay the course.\n\n**Reason 6: To Keep Rewards Fair**\n\nRewarding employees is a great way to boost their morale and performance\nevaluation makes it easy to decide the deserving candidate. Keeping track of\nperformances of each employee in detail make this process a lot easier and\nunbiased.\n\n**Reason 7: To Give Clarity to Employees**\n\nWhen the employer gives priority to the performance evaluation, employees\nlearn exactly what is expected of them. It helps the new employees to gear up\ntheir work and meet the company\u2019s outlined expectations.\n\n**Reason 8: For Positive Reinforcement**\n\nPerformance evaluation is not only to point out shortcomings of employees but\nalso to provide positive reinforcement for a job well done. Positive feedback\nwill encourage the employee to continue better performance.\n\n**Reason 9: For Determining Weak Links**\n\nThrough performance evaluations, you get to know what\u2019s off beam in your\nworking process. You find out where you are going wrong and which employees\naren't performing well enough. You can use software and apps to keep track of\ntheir performances. From this determination, you can design several routes in\nfixing the problem. You can either enroll the weak employee in a training\nprogram or let him go.\n\n**A Final Thought**\n\nThe success rate of your business highly relies on how well your employees are\nperforming. If conducted correctly and frequently, employee performance\nmeasurement can have a really positive effect on your company. Considering all\nthe reasons listed above take steps to enhance your productivity and take your\nsuccess rate to peak with regular performance evaluation of your employees.\n\n\n\n![Business](https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Business](https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/11/Business__1510092502-1024x442.jpg)\n\n[geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt/) / Pixabay\n\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2018%2F01%2Femployee-\nperformance-evaluation-important-\nbusiness%2F)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20Is%20Employee%20Performance%20Evaluation%20Important%20For%20Your%20Business%3F&url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/employee-\nperformance-evaluation-important-business/&via=valuewalk)\n\n**For exclusive info on hedge funds and the latest news from value investing\nworld at only a few dollars a month check out ValueWalk Premium[right\nhere](https://valuewalkpremium.com/register/).**\n\n**Multiple people interested?
