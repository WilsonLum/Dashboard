Tech sector worried about loss of income caused by\nCOVID-19_**\n\ntechUK conducted a survey with the tech sector in response to the impact of\nCOVID-19 to get a better understanding of how the pandemic is impacting the\nsector.\n\nOf the 100 responses received, the survey showed that lost income and lost\nproductivity were the two issues of most concern to businesses, both in the\nshort and long-term.\n\nWhilst only 6% of respondents felt a cessation of trading/doing business was a\nlikely outcome in the short-term, this was a concern for nearly 30% of\nrespondents if restrictions remained in place for a longer period, according\nto techUK.\n\nSupply chain disruption is also noted by respondents as a concern both in the\nshort and longer-term, with 40% of respondents citing it as a concern.\n\nWhile the UK has not implemented any restrictions at borders and ports to\ndate, members are anticipating a slow down as staffing levels are impacted\n(borders and customs officials), and this is being seen in third countries\nwhere our members operate.\n\nThe survey also flagged concerns techUK is hearing around liquidity and access\nto finance, particularly for SMEs (which form half of all respondents to this\nsurvey).\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s tech sector has long been a bright star in the UK economy, growing\nat six times the rate of the rest of the economy, accounting for 7.7% of UK\nGVA. It will be vital to the UK\u2019s recovery as a whole that the sector is\nsupported through this period of disruption and uncertainty,\u201d said Vinous Ali,\nAssociate Director for Policy, techUK.\n\n\u201cJust two weeks ago a fifth of our sector reported feeling little to no impact\non their business as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe increased rate of spread and the Government restrictions put in place to\nslow that spread have changed the landscape dramatically.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**_April 07, 12:54 - COVID-19 pandemic leads to \"massive\" uptick in demand for\ncomputing capacity_**\n\nNorthern Data AG has reported that the COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in a\nmassive increase in computing capacity demand.\n\nIn order to meet the increased demand, the company has instigated an\nacceleration of the expansion of capacities at its locations and in addition\nis looking to develop further locations.\n\nImmediate demand for computing power in the wake of the pandemic is being\ndriven by two immediate and game-changing developments.\n\nFirstly, pharmaceutical companies and research institutions worldwide are\nusing HPC systems on a large scale for the first time in order to carry out\ncalculations and simulations in the field of bioinformatics and epidemiology\nin the shortest possible time, which with conventional computer systems can\ntake several months or even years.\n\nNorthern Data management expects this trend to continue after the end of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSecondly, working conditions worldwide have shifted drastically online in a\nmatter of weeks through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, this has led to a\nmassive increase in demand for computing capacity.\n\nDue to the current restrictions, many companies in parts of the United States,\nEurope and Asia are forced to operate with an almost 100% home office ratio.\n\nThe associated use of digital applications such as video conferencing tools is\ncausing an explosion in demand for data capacities.

Helping people get\nthe right information to stay healthy is more important than ever in the face\nof a global pandemic like Covid-19\u201d\n\nFacebook, which has pledged $20 million, will reportedly give $1,000 to each\nmember of its global workforce as its offices around the world remain closed.\n\nApple has so far pledged $15 million to fight the outbreak and will match\nemployee donations \u201ctwo-to-one\u201d. Many of its stores around the world remain\nclosed.\n\nAmazon is to employ an additional 100,000 people in the US, with further\ntargets for its other global markets. The drive will prioritise those who have\nlost their jobs in sectors such as hospitality and retail.\n\nThe latest announcement from the Gates Foundation confirmed that it is to\ndonate \u201cup to $100 million\u201d in addition to spearheading the \u201cinitiative to\nspeed development and access to therapies\u201d. The foundation will donate up to\n$50 million to this fund, while partners Wellcome will contribute $50 million\nand the Mastercard Impact Fund will donate $25 million.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

These cover:\n\n  * Supporting dynamic risk assessments by providing education, reassurance and readiness statements.\n  * Reallocating capacity to on-demand cloud services which can be used by public sector organisations to host citizen-facing and patient-centric services which reduce the need for in-person interactions\n  * Supporting technologically secure remote working for health professionals, civil servants and other public sector workers\n  * Provision of skilled and vetted specialists for \u201cshort-term staff augmentation or outcome-based project engagements\u201d.\n  * Stress testing to cope with disaster recovery, \u2018burst\u2019 capacity, and multi-agency collaboration\n\n\u201cAs the implications of the coronavirus become clearer, we undertook a rapid\nrisk assessment which determined the potential need for additional capacity\nbased on the increased demand for our existing and new services,\u201d said Erik\nBjontegard,  president and founder of Spark Compass UK\n\n\u201cIn contrast with traditional on-premises IT environments, cloud services\nprovided by UKCloud are inherently elastic and better suited to dynamic and\nunpredictable demands such as those caused by this coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\nBjontegard added.\n\n**Cisco**\n\nCisco has seen a seven-fold increase in adoption of its Webex collaboration\nplatform in countries affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. In response Cisco\nis providing free Webex and security technologies to any organisation -\nensuring that newly remote workforces can stay up and running\n\nChintan Patel, chief technologist for Cisco UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWhile there\nis no replacement for meeting face-to-face and being in the same room as a\ncolleague or customer, video meetings are proven to be more effective than\nvoice calls. In fact, 93% of employees say video calls improve interactions\nand client relationships. It\u2019s a simple thing, but seeing someone\u2019s face as\nwell as hearing their voice can be invaluable to remote workers.\u201d\n\n**ServiceNow**\n\nServiceNow has announced a Customer Care Program to support public and private\nsector organisations in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. ServiceNow has\nreleased four new apps that will be free of charge until 30 September.\nServiceNow is also making donations to the International Medical Corps and the\nCDC Foundation totaling $100,000 to help fund supplies for key workers.\n\n  * Emergency Outreach\n  * Emergency Self Report\n  * Emergency Exposure Management\n  * Emergency Response Operations app for government agencies\n\n**Vodafone**\n\nVodafone has released a five-point plan, outlining its pledge to customers\nover the coming months. All new measures will remain in place until 1\nSeptember.\n\nNick Read, chief executive of Vodafone Group Plc, said: \u201cThrough our networks,\nand our dedicated team, we will strive to ensure that people stay connected to\ntheir family and friends, businesses can continue to run using remote working,\nour health services get all the support we can deliver and students are able\nto continue their education virtually.\n\n\u201cWhilst still putting the health and safety of our teams first, using our\nremote working technology, our teams are working round the clock to ensure\nthat we deliver on this plan. I want to personally thank them all for\nproviding this critical service for our customers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe plan covers:\n\n1) Maintaining the quality of service of networks\n\n2) Providing network capacity and services for critical government functions\n\n3) Improving dissemination of information to the public\n\n4) Facilitating working from home and helping the small and micro businesses\nwithin our Supply Chain\n\n5) Improving governments\u2019 insights into people\u2019s movements in affected areas\n\n**Comcast**\n\nIn the US, Comcast is offering free Wifi hotspots with no data caps,\ndisconnects or late fees and speeds will increase to 3 Mbps. The provider has\nalso \u201cpaused enforcement\u201d of its data caps.\n\n**Ring VPN**\n\nVirtual private network, RingVPN, has announced it will be providing free VPN\naccess for 90 days, helping millions of Brits who are preparing to spend weeks\nor even months in self-isolation.\n\nChief marketing officer Cian McKenna-Charley, said: \"We understand millions of\npeople will be taking the necessary precautionary measures of working from\nhome, social distancing and, if necessary, self- isolation. Businesses and\nstaff face an uncertain time and we\u2019d rather not add to their anxieties, but\ninstead do what we can to help make life that little bit easier. By making\nRingVPN free for all, people can use the internet safely and securely from\ntheir own home at no expense until normality is resumed.\u201d\n\n**Cyber Risk Aware**\n\nAs cyber criminals take the opportunity to access vulnerable networks, Cyber\nRisk Aware is offering free Covid-19 Phishing Tests to help businesses defend\ntheir network against increased cyber threats during this Coronavirus pandemic\nperiod. It is also providing a free \"Cyber Security Outside the Office\" course\nto help strengthen all points of entry.\n\n\u201cAt a time when businesses and individuals are more vulnerable, many working\nremotely to mitigate the spread of this pandemic, organisations need to pull\ntogether for the greater good. Keeping businesses operational and protecting\nwork forces from escalating threats should be a global consideration and a\nunited collaboration,\u201d said CEO and cyber security expert, Stephen Burke.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Millennials and Generation Z\u2019s will save the

region of\nLombardy.\n\n* * *\n\n**First identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, last December, the\nCovid-19 Coronavirus has spread across the globe at an unprecedented rate,\ninfecting more than 250,000 and killing over 10,000 people, with official\nfigures no hiding what is still about to come.**\n\nOutbreaks outside of China in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy, became the\nmore regionalised epicentres of the disease that spread to almost all\ncountries and territories on the planet.\n\nIn Europe, Italy has been severely impacted, and a large part of the cases\nacross the continent and other regions has been traced back to Italy,\nespecially the northern part of the country, in the Lombardy region.\n\nIf we look at the epicentre, right in the middle is the city of Bergamo with a\npopulation of approximately 122,000 which has been hit by the virus as almost\nnowhere else as.\n\nAnd it is precisely in Bergamo that one of Italy's - and Europe's as well -\nlargest data centre campuses operates.\n\nSitting on more than two million square feet of land, [Aruba\nS.p.A](https://data-economy.com/aruba-unveils-2-million-sqf-italian-data-\ncentre-brexit-shifts-barycenter-eu-uk/).'s hyperscale data centre operations\nin Bergamo power hundreds of businesses across Italy and Central Europe.\n\nWith the pandemic taking never seen proportions in the Lombardy region, _Data\nEconomy_ spoke to Gabriele Sposato, CMO of Aruba S.P.A. on how the business is\nhandling this crisis whilst keeping services running without interruption.\n\n* * *\n\n**How is Covid-19 impacting the business?**\n\nOur data centres and services are continuing to operate with no interruptions\nbut of course Coronavirus has impacted people\u2019s lives in Italy and across the\nworld. We\u2019ve all had to change our daily habits and for some of us that\nincludes the way we work. Inside Italy, travelling and transferring from one\npoint to another is forbidden in most cases. Only travel deemed necessary is\nallowed to pass through checkpoints.\n\nFrom an operations perspective, at the moment Aruba employees have been\ninstructed to operate remotely in the safe confines of their homes. So, what\nwas originally intended for some of our workforce has now been extended to the\nmajority of the employees. Aruba is in a better position compared to companies\nin other sectors. In IT, work can largely be done remotely, and the benefits\nof working in such a sector, is that most if not all work can be performed\nremotely.\n\nThe current situation does not have an immediate block or a devastating impact\nin the short term but we can say that our employees who operate remotely from\nhome, are benefiting from our full IT support, including being equipped with\nlaptops/computers, VPN to access shared internal systems and materials, tools\nto allow virtual meetings, 1:1\u2019s, call conferences and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n**Have any of your staff tested positive and how did the business deal with\nthe outcome?**\n\nIt is a scenario that we are trying to avoid and we are taking care of all\naspects and applying all measures to keep the business running. If this does\nhappen, it will not be affecting our services or data centres.\n\n* * *\n\n**What is your contingency plan?**\n\nWe are 100% operational on a remote working level and to support remote\nworking, our employees have been provided with all the necessary tools at our\ndisposal so that they can continue to service our data centres and let our\ncustomers be supported with all the services needed.\n\nWithin the data centres themselves, we have taken extra care and attention\ntowards implementing measures that would allow us to protect the premises and\nallow our employees to continue their shifts, monitoring the DC\ninfrastructure, and, in general, the facility. This includes cleaning,\ndisinfecting, providing masks to staff on site, etc. This is what we generally\ndo in the FOC (Facility Operation Center) and NOC (Network Operation Center)\nso we are well prepared for this.\n\nAcross the wider business this means we are empowering \u2018virtual\u2019 relationships\nwith our other colleagues, teams, staff and customers too. Crucially, we have\nthe skills and experience necessary to make the company work even in a\ndifferent configuration that we\u2019re not used to on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAn active task force which includes Aruba\u2019s management is monitoring the\nsituation day by day, by considering all the continuous governmental rules and\nthe national healthcare system advice which is to be applied in order to take\nall the necessary measures and guarantee the business continuity and our\nemployees\u2019 safety.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

It\u2019s for\nthat reason that our systems are built and managed to perform, even with\nincreased demand.\n\nWe are prepared for events such as this and as a result, our customers can be\nsure we are taking care of all of their needs. We have adopted and applied all\nnecessary measures in order to let our data centers/services run as normal.\n\n* * *\n\n**How is Covid-19 affecting your other business regions of operation in\nPoland, Germany, CZ, France and the UK?**\n\nAs this is a global issue there is of course a wide-ranging impact, but we are\nworking with our local teams and partners to ensure there is no interruption\nto our services and all our customers across Europe should be aware of the\nfact that we adopted all the correct and possible measures. As a matter of\nfact, we can guarantee our SLA.\n\n* * *\n\n**How is this pandemic affecting the long term plans for the business?**\n\nNobody can determine the long-term impact, however, there will be risks, but\nalso opportunities. At the moment we are currently focused on providing daily\nsupport to our staff and customers. Ensuring staff are healthy and customers\nexperience no interruption to their service are key.\n\n* * *\n\n**How is Aruba helping the local community during this crisis?**\n\nIn this first phase, we\u2019re focusing on our employees. This is a priority\nbecause by guaranteeing their work and contracts, we are ensuring we support\nthem and their families in this difficult scenario.\n\nAt the same time, we are also activating specific initiatives which include\nproviding concrete equipment to support local health facilities in Tuscany and\nLombardy.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  *

Law\n\n* * *\n\n**The pipeline of new data centres is under threat as the supply of labour and\nparts is halted by the international response to the Covid-19 pandemic.**\n\nGlobally, the [construction of new centres](https://data-economy.com/data-\ncentre-construction-top-74bn-market-value/) had been growing at a compound\nannual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.61% since 2017, and was predicted to reach\nvalues of US$73.87bn by 2021. However, that trajectory is now unlikely to\ncontinue.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing quite a lot of sites shutting down. Quite a lot in central\nEurope where people are on lock down and there is no labour that can get to\nsite,\u201d said Ed Cooke, the founder of Conexus Law.\n\n\u201cIn the UK we are starting to see that happen too, and it will continue. The\nbig question is how long does it go on for?\u201d\n\nIn Europe, Asia and now the US, the complex web of specialist suppliers and\nsubcontractors \u2013 who themselves are reliant on labour and parts \u2013 are now\nchecking their contracts for force majeure clauses. However, Cooke said these\nare unlikely to cover the disruption.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at two things: Firstly, the very fact Covid-19 occurred, is\nit a force majeure event? The other question is whether or not the global\nresponse from governments has been a force majeure event in itself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAre the sanctions and government measures a force majeure event or does it\nfall under another provision in the contract? That\u2019s important because if a\nforce majeure event happens, as a contracted party you are given relief from\nhaving to comply with your obligations. Basically, you are given time,\u201d Cooke\nadded.\n\nIf left unmanaged, the domino effect is likely to continue down the line, with\nCooke warning that any loss of tier one and tier two suppliers could create a\nvoid in the supply chain when construction resumes.\n\nThose who may be planning to rely on business interruption insurance are also\nlikely to face issue. Interruption insurance is most often purchased as an\nadd-on to building insurance, meaning it is unlikely to cover interruption\nevents that are not triggered by damage to, or the destruction of, property.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is that it\u2019s time for the government to step up. I know they\nare trying to tackle an ever shifting situation and we can\u2019t expect them to\nhave answers to every question from day one. But at some point they will have\nto step in and protect these businesses, because otherwise we are going to\nhave a decimated economy for a very long time,\u201d Cooke warned.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Prioritise the most important contracts and/or the most critical\nsupplies;\n\nReview customer contracts for your own obligations as the situation continues\nto unfold. It is also advisable to look for clauses that may release you from\nobligations;\n\nConsider the risk of insolvency in your supply chain and its potential impact.\nIf a supplier goes out of business the project has a problem, whether it\u2019s due\nto force majeure or otherwise.\n\nConduct a risk assessment: What is happening? Who is responsible for what?\nWhere do the risks lie and how can we address them?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s then a question of having some sensible conversations,\u201d Cooke\nadvised.\n\nExtraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and the tech industry \u2013\nlike the rest of the business world \u2013 will be required to go above and beyond\nwhat is considered good business practice over the coming months.\n\n\u201cWhatever the contracts says, people are going to have to be practical about\nthis and come up with the best solutions for everybody,\u201d Cooke said.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment when relationships are really going to be tested,\nparticularly the commitment from suppliers. If you are able to stand up to the\nplate and do what is required of you, and do your very best even in these very\nadverse circumstances, you can build relationships for a very long time, I\nthink. If you are seen to be shirking your responsibilities or sitting back, I\nthink that\u2019s where you will destroy your relationships very quickly. People\nhave to look to the long term.\u201d\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Edge IT infrastructure CAPEX to reach $700bn within next decade](https://data-economy.com/edge-it-infrastructure-capex-to-reach-700bn-within-next-decade/)\n  * [G-Core expands its US hosting and CDN reach with Virginia move](https://data-economy.com/g-core-expands-its-us-hosting-and-cdn-reach-with-virginia-move/)\n  * [Microsoft bolsters easier IoT to cloud data security with industry partners](https://data-economy.com/microsoft-bolsters-easier-iot-to-cloud-data-security-with-industry-partners/)\n  * [Google Cloud appoints Karan Bajwa as Managing Director for India](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-appoints-karan-bajwa-as-managing-director-for-india/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Conexus Law](https://data-economy.com/tag/conexus-law/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/data-centre-construction-projects-under-threat-from-covid-19-coronavirus/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/data-centre-construction-projects-under-threat-from-covid-19-coronavirus/&text=Data centre construction projects under threat from Covid-19 via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/data-centre-construction-projects-under-threat-from-covid-19-coronavirus/&mini=true&title=Data centre construction projects under threat from Covid-19)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fdata-centre-construction-projects-under-threat-from-covid-19-coronavirus%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n# More News\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/johannesburg-408643_1920-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Africa Data Centres acquires Standard Bank\u2019s data centre hub in\nJohannesburg](https://data-economy.com/africa-data-centres-acquires-standard-\nbanks-data-centre-hub-in-johannesburg/)\n\n![Coronavirus](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-4904410_1280-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Live / Covid-19 Coronavirus news: How the data centre world is dealing with\nthe pandemic](https://data-economy.com/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-\ndata-centre-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-things-\njune-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [5 things to know for April 7: AWS unveils Amazon Detective, Uganda gets new\ndata centre, Nutanix Partners with Udacity](https://data-economy.com/5-things-\nto-know-for-april-7-aws-unveils-amazon-detective-uganda-gets-new-data-centre-\nnutanix-partners-with-udacity/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

The special promotion extends Cobalt\nIron's Compass\u2122 enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) data protection\nsolution to new customers for the same price they're currently paying for\nservice and support contracts on their existing backup systems, with no\npayments or interest in 2020.\n\n\"A wide range of enterprises have already been advancing toward a more remote\nwork culture as teams have become more globalized. But now, with the\ncoronavirus pandemic, many companies are scrambling to make the transition to\nremote backup operations in a highly compressed time frame,\" said Andy Hurt,\nchief marketing officer, Cobalt Iron. \"In the face of the largest global\ncrisis since World War II, the last thing companies should have to worry about\nis effective backup deployment, operation, administration, and protection of\ndata from cyber threats.\"\n\nHe added: \"By allowing organizations to modernize their backup infrastructure\nfor a nominal investment, this promotion will help them to keep data secure\nand ensure business continuity -- even when administrators can't be physically\npresent at the data center. Migrating to Compass can bring them capex\nreductions of up to 50% and opex savings up to 90%. And, they'll reap the\nbenefits of near-autonomous operations, industry-leading cyber security,\nransomware protection, and support for legacy and modern workloads.\"\n\nThe Make the Switch Without the Risk program enables enterprises to migrate to\nCompass with zero incremental increase in software costs, and no payment or\ninterest in 2020, and it also offers deep discounts on optimized hardware and\nmultiple financing options. Cobalt Iron will provide remote deployment, setup,\nand configuration. The offer is available through members of Cobalt Iron's\nIronClad Partner Advantage program.\n\n\"It's easy to monitor and manage backups from any location using Compass' web-\nbased user interface. But in addition to remote access, there are plenty of\nother compelling reasons to migrate to Compass under this program,\" said Hurt.\n\"For no more than their current support and maintenance costs, organizations\ncan upgrade to a backup solution that supports private, hybrid, and public\ncloud deployments. And, rather than leave security and ransomware protection\nas an afterthought or add-on, we've woven the industry's most advanced cyber\nsecurity measures into the fabric of Compass.\"\n\nMore information about Make the Switch Without the Risk and the Compass\nenterprise SaaS data protection solution is available at www.cobaltiron.com.\n\n# # #\n\n **About Cobalt Iron**  \nCobalt Iron is the global leader in SaaS-based enterprise data protection.

The one thing good of the season being cancelled is I could pretend\nit never happened and I never went to the Bayern game (can I have my money\nback?).\n\nLike Basil Fawlty, \u2018oh what a terrible dream\u201d.\n\nBut as my sister (curse my great grandfathers life choices, we're all stuck\nwith them) pointed out, without access to a pitch and a paying public, we have\nto find new an innovative ways to make tits of ourselves on a weekly basis.\n\nFirst up Levy. Who\u2019s middle name is presumably \u2018Tony-Deaf\u2019. \u201cFurlough staff?\nindeed. That Mike Ashley knows a PR slam dunk when he sees one. That\u2019s why I\u2019m\npaid the big bucks. The really big, delicious bucks \u2014 with even a bonus for\nthe late delivery of a start-of-the-art shrine to franchise restauranteering.\nNow mop that floor and then bugger off, I\u2019m not paying you up til 5.30 today\nto glower at me\"\n\nBut of course it\u2019s mostly the decision to fire the most popular Tottenham\nmanager of modern times, for \u2026.the temerity of not refreshing or bolstering\nhis squad from his own pocket?\n\nBut wait! That\u2019s not enough, you must then go on to replace him with the\nSoccer Sauron, (or as Morrissey knows him \u201cThis Charmless Man\u201d).\n\nWhat to say about Jose? Well I guess we had three days of smiles and sunshine,\nand any more could be seen as greedy. But it was still depressing it all went\nback to type pretty quickly\u2014\n\n\u201cBut you said you were happy, had a great squad and would be a positive and\ninvigorating force getting us to play exciting progressive football \u2014 and it\nseems you\u2019re still a sniping, miserable arse who hates everyone, takes no\nresponsibility and has us playing like Neanderthal Rovers\u201d.\n\n\u201cRespect! I am like the scorpion on the frogs back, it is my nature\u2026.Now\nwhere\u2019s my 13 million quid?\u201d\n\nSo of course Jose did the one thing he could to take pressure off Levy. Look\nto his results? God no! Foster team spirit in lockdown? Yeah right! Set out\nhis footballing vision? Oh behave! Do something incredible for char\u2026 OK I\u2019ll\nstop now.\n\nNo, **[let\u2019s break the law AND club\npolicy](https://www.football365.com/news/spurs-mourinho-ndombele-sanchez-\nsessegnon)** , during the worst crisis the country has had since World War 2.\nBetter still, in public. I don\u2019t see why they didn\u2019t go the whole hog, strip\nnaked and write in marker pen on their chests, and have a mud wrestling\ncompetition of \u2018Divs\u2019 vs \u201cIdiots\u201d, while Mourino shouts \u201cSCHNELL\u201d through a\nmegaphone. basically turn the whole history of Tottenham Hotspur into some\nkind of dirty protest, quite apt really.\n\nI mean I guess Jose just needed to ask himself. \u201cHmmm. Wait a minute..would an\na**hole do it?\u2026Yes? Right lads, lace up! and fetch me my monocle!\"\n\nAnyhooo. Not to be despondent. I mean, we had a good run, for a few seasons,\nand a not totally begrudged one. Like in Life of Brian, I did get a lot of\n\u201cOoooh it\u2019s the Spurs! Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting something, cos you've had\na hell of a time.\u201d\n\nAnd there is one silver lining, at least we sold Kyle Walker.  \n**Dom \u201cOh Well \" Salmon**\n\n\n\n**But the Levy was dry**  \nObviously, one of the main reasons Football365 gets so many \u2018hits\u2019 on its\nmailbox page, is due to people wanting to know my latest thoughts on my\nbeloved Tottenham and its owners.\n\nI have mainly held off in the last week, apart from putting the usual morally\nsuperior Liverpool supporter in his place only to find that is now well and\ntruly f\u2026.d.\n\nHowever, I can no longer hold my tongue or indeed keyboard any longer. The\nstory of Lord Levy of the manor **[looking to employ the club ground staff on\nhis estate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/04/07/daniel-levy-\nconsiders-putting-tottenham-ground-staff-work-private/)** to tend to his\nshrubberies and ex-Tottenham managers replica gnome collection had me choking\non my Corn Flakes.\n\nTo recap, Joe Lewis worth approx. 4.5Bn large ones and Daniel Levy who has\npaid himself a 3m large ones bonus for delivering a late and overbudget Lady\nGa Ga concert emporium have decided to furlough non-playing staff in the\nexpectation the government, of whom Bermudian based Lewis pays no income tax,\nto pick up the bill.\n\nMy understanding is the delay in the Premier League players reaching a pay\ncut/deferral is they want the monies saved to go to the NHS and other\napplicable charities and not for a cost saving benefit for the owners.\n\nI wonder which owners they have in mind?\n\nI look forward to the next edition of Gardeners World being from the Levy\nestate.  \n**David Harris, Sydney, Australia**\n\n\n\n**Fan mail**  \nAfter 4 weeks of not contributing or reading the mailbox due to the pointless\nnull and void debates I wanted to chime in about the Lfc reversal debate.\n\nAm sorry in advance if this has been brought up already.\n\nThe owners had a stinker but the Lfc fans played a blinder in getting it\nreversed. It's rare I see the entire fan base singing off the same hymn sheet\n(unless it's virgil related) but they were out in force to Peter Moore once\nthe original decision was disclosed and they made sure they did enough to get\nit changed.\n\nHave a go at FSG, they deserve it, but if your own moral compass can't at the\nsame time credit Lfc fans, well then your own opinion on the subject is\nironically null and void.  \n**Luke**\n\n\n\n**Liverpool have shown City how it 's done**  \nWhat a pathetic analogy you make between **[drowning kittens and Liverpool's\nu-turn](https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-furlough-mailbox-kittens)**\nover the furlough debacle! I agree that their should be no thanks or\ncongratulations over their decision change but the people that decided to do\nit in the first place are not football people, they are businessmen. They\ndidn\u2019t foresee the backlash from their own fans but they listened, changed\ntheir decision and apologised for it. That puts them on a higher pedestal than\nTottenham, Newcastle and the others that carry on regardless of public\nopinion.\n\nAlso, look at city, caught fiddling their books and given a suitable\npunishment. Do they hold their hands up and apologise? Do the b*llocks, they\nsay that they will fight it every step and use whatever resources they need.\nKinda like OJ & the glove incident (I\u2019m using an extreme analogy now but hey\u2026\nI didn\u2019t start it lol), money talks and an expensive lawyer can get you out of\na lot. City\u2019s owners would gain far more respect by apologising and accepting\nit (we all know they\u2019re guilty and have been manipulating ffp since it came\nin). BUT again, they are businessmen that will do what they believe is right\nfor them, their club & more importantly their long term future and the\nfinances that come with it & that is my analogy between them and the teammate\nusing/abusing furlough.\n\nStay safe,  \n**Marcel G LFC**\n\n\n\n**Backtracking is tough  \n**I totally agree with the sentiment expressed by Ryan (Whitehaven) in\n**[yesterday afternoon's mailbox](https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-\nfurlough-mailbox-kittens)**, about how backtracking on announced plans to\ndrown kittens would not deserve praise, in a parallel to Liverpool's\nbacktracking on their staffing decision. My own reaction to the club's\ndecision was relief and mild satisfaction, rather than pride and admiration.\n\nOn the flip-side, which is usually the more difficult decision - admitting you\nwere horribly wrong and thoroughly apologizing for it in public, or getting it\nright to begin with? FSG have proven time and time again that they will listen\nto fans and compromise. This is yet another reason why the rush to judgment\nabout them in the 48 hours between the initial decision and the backtracking\nwas not rational or well-reasoned: there was an assumption among the vast\nmajority (notable exception: Mark, MCFC) that there wasn't any likelihood or\nhope that it would be reversed.\n\nOn a related note, I wrote in **[yesterday\nmorning](https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-furlough-mailbox-\nkittens)** about how people should be directing their anger and frustration at\nthe UK Government's lack of competent governance, oversight and crisis\nmanagement, rather than getting apopleptic at one immoral business at a time.\nAndy (MUFC) took the time to write in about how I was apparently being\npatronising, althewhile neglecting to acknowledge that Sheffield United had\nalso announced the intention to avail the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\nearlier that morning. Again, this is not Whatabouttery, this is pointing out\nthat having emotionally irrational diatribes against singular clubs, one-by-\none, is futile if you want to actually protect the taxpayers' money rather\nthan using it as an opportunity to criticize rival clubs.\n\n(Also, Andy, I acknowledged in my first mail that Liverpool had made the wrong\ndecision, implicitly because it was a terrible PR decision. One might describe\nyour paragraph about companies voluntarily exhibiting social responsibility\ncould be described as patronising\u2026 :))  \n**Oliver Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland**\n\n\n\n**' Good old Liverpool'**  \nSo Liverpool FC has bowed to 'fan pressure' and decided to reverse its\ndecision to use the government's 'furlough' scheme to ensure that its low-paid\nworkers receive their usual pay during this crisis.\n\n'A morally correct decision' everybody cries. 'Good old Liverpool, I knew they\nwere better than that'. But will these same workers now receive all of their\nnormal income during this crisis, or have Liverpool simply sacrificed them on\nthe alter of public opinion?\n\nWe shall see. Possibly.  \n**Mike, Canada expat.**\n\n\n\n**Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader**  \nLineker, Rooney, Taylor et al have all missed the point entirely. People\naren\u2019t outraged at footballers because they earn a lot of money. They are\noutraged at footballers because:\n\n1) their employers continue to pay them the same huge amount of money\n\nWHILST AT THE SAME TIME\n\n2) furloughing staff on much lower salaries (probably minimum wage in a lot of\ncases).\n\n3) NOT producing a product.\n\n4) allowing the government to pay 80% of those employees salaries, whilst 1)\nand 3) apply\n\nThese are the crucial points. If you can\u2019t see there is something wrong with\nthat then you seriously are living in a totally other version of cloud cuckoo\nland.\n\nShow me another industry where the same applies and I will happily shout\nangrily about that injustice too. Formula 1 being a prime possibility -\nalthough I have no idea if the drivers are still being paid. If they are, then\nthat\u2019s just as bad. British Airways? True, they have virtually no product.\nYes, their staff are being furloughed. But their highly paid executives\n(assuming they are still taking their full salary - although bonuses will be\nmuch lower anyway) working their asses off in the current climate to keep the\ncompany alive. I\u2019m no fan of fat cat wages and the disparity with workers, but\nnobody\u2019s on full pay doing nothing there. Similarly, anyone who is already\nlucky enough to be sitting on a pile of already earned billions or millions is\nentitled to do what they want with it. They are not meeting the criteria above\neither.\n\nTo also jump up and down saying \u2018why is it footballers always get crapped on\u2019\njust compounds the issue. If anyone else in any other walk of life were to say\nthe same, they would be labelled with a persecution complex. Despite these\ndays of mental health enlightenment, that person would most likely be told to\ngrow up, f*** off, get a grip and stop moaning.\n\nYes, footballers are getting the bulk of the attention. But only because the\npress choose to focus on them. Footballers (and ex footballers and anyone else\nwho feels the need to join their cheerleader group) need to be very, very\ncareful with the points they are making. Taking the p*** is one thing, but\ntrying to pull the wool over the very people who pay your salaries by choosing\nto misrepresent the facts will be very, very hard to forgive.  \n**Ally, London**\n\n\n\n**30 years ago today**  \nDear Football365,\n\nToday is the 30th anniversary of my earliest football memory: Crystal Palace\nbeating Liverpool 4-3 in the 1990 FA Cup Semi-Final. Anyone with time on their\nhands wanting to read something long about that and the ensuing Final can read\n**[this](https://www.football365.com/news/f365s-welcome-guest-fa-cup-\nfinal-1990)**.\n\nIncidentally that game took place at Villa Park, while Manchester United v\nOldham Athletic was played at Maine Road. Semi-finals at neutral grounds need\nto make a comeback.  \n**Ed Quoththeraven**\n\n\n\n**Bearded dragons**  \nIn response to **[Mikey, CFC's Bearded\nXI](https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-furlough-mailbox-kittens)**,\nhere is my team with current players (and manager) in a realistic formation\nthat could take on most XIs.  \nRules are simple: 1) I cannot picture them without a beard (sorry Rooney - I\nremember the early years), 2) they are picked on their current form (sorry\nDaniele De Rossi and Raul Meireles - 2 bearded heroes), and 3) we're talking\nfull beards (sorry Adil Rami's glorious mustache)\u2026\n\nGK - Alisson Becker (Liverpool) - Best 'keeper in the world, sporting a\ndistinctly disheveled look.  \nLB - Marcelo (Real Madrid) - Solid afro/beard combo and the most solid LB of\nthe past decade.  \nCB - Nicolas Otamendi (Manchester City) - I really wanted to pick Sergio Ramos\nbut he changes his look too often, so the ginger-bearded store-brand Ramos it\nis.  \nCB - Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona) - Lots of injuries but has diligently\nmaintained his beard throughout.  \nRB - Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid) - Good player, even better facial hair.  \nCM - Arturo Vidal (Barcelona) - Intimidating beard/shark fin mohawk combo.\nPerfect.  \nCM - Joao Moutinho (Wolves) - Stud. Bearded Icon. Wish he had moved to the\nPremier League earlier.  \nCAM - Isco (Real Madrid) - Not sure what's in the water in Madrid, but it's\ncertainly helping some impressive beard growth. The player Grealish thinks he\nis.  \nLW - Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) - Wanted to pick Thomas Lemar, but kept\npicturing fresh-faced singer Lemar. Silva gets played here slightly out of\nposition (he'll be fine).  \nST - Gabriel Barbosa aka Gabigol (Flamengo) - Ooooh exotic. Never seen a\npicture of him without a beard. Looks to be an exciting player and a Bearded\nXI needs a bit of mystery.*  \nRW - Mohamed Salad (Liverpool) - Egyptian King. Bearded Genius.\n\nManager - Nuno Espirito Santo (Wolves) - Biblical beard. Has done astonishing\nwork with Wolves and could get this team playing some Old Testament football\nto devastating effect.\n\n**Elias (*Benzema up top if I 'm limiting this to players in England and Spain\n[I'm not]), LFC, Johannesburg.**\n\n_PS: Self-isolation is the perfect time to get started on a beard._\n\n\n\ngood morning,\n\nWith so much moral outrage in recent mailboxes often coupled with a total lack\nof self awareness, please allow me to contribute. How can you justify\npublishing Mikey, CFC's bearded XI?\n\nHow is it possible that Mile Jedinak, who had the greatest beard in football\nhistory, is not in the team. Plus he comes across as a nice chap. Then there\nis Socrates, the greatest smoking footballer of all time, who would light up\nin the centre circle at penalty shootouts. Rio Ferdinand?

Not only will we ourselves enjoy greater operating\nefficiency, but we believe, it will also encourage others to adopt our public\ncloud infrastructure,\" Zhang said in the call.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company also warned that the Coronavirus gripping\nChina could have impact on the company's retail business this year, but it\ndidn't mention the cloud portion specifically.\n\nYesterday's revenue report puts Alibaba on a $6 billion U.S. run rate, good\nfor fourth place in the cloud infrastructure market share race, but well\nbehind the market leaders. In the most recent earnings reports, Google\nreported $2.5 billion in revenue, Microsoft reported $12.5 billion in combined\nsoftware and infrastructure revenue and market leader AWS reported a tad under\n$10 billion for the quarter.\n\n[As with Google](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/google-cloud-makes-strides-\nbut-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/), Alibaba sits well in the back of the pack,\nas [Synergy Research's](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/incremental-\ngrowth-cloud-spending-hits-new-high-while-amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-clear-\nlead-reno-nv-february-4-2020) latest market share data shows.

Both are eCommerce giants. Both have\ncloud computing arms. Alibaba, however, came much later to the cloud computing\nside of the house, launching in 2009, but really only beginning to take it\nseriously in 2015.\n\nAt the time, cloud division president Simon Hu [boasted to\nReuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-cloud-\nidUSKCN0Q30TP20150729) that his company would overtake Amazon in the cloud\nmarket within 4 years. \"Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether\nthat\u2019s in customers, technology, or worldwide scale,\" he said at the time.\n\nThey aren't close to achieving that goal, of course, but they are growing\nsteadily in a hot cloud infrastructure market.

But a couple of years\nago, the online marketplace for crafts and vintage items decided to modernize\nand began its journey to the cloud.\n\nThat decision coincided with the arrival of CTO Mike Fisher in July 2017. He\nwas originally brought in as a consultant to look at the impact of running\ndata centers on [Etsy's ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/etsy) ability to\ninnovate. As you might expect, he concluded that it was having an adverse\nimpact and began a process that would lead to him being hired to lead a long-\nterm migration to the cloud.\n\nThat process concluded last month. This is the story of how a company born in\ndata centers made the switch to the cloud, and the lessons it offers.\n\n## Stuck in a hardware refresh loop\n\nWhen Fisher walked through the door, Etsy operated out of private data\ncenters. It was not even taking advantage of a virtualization layer to\nmaximize the capacity of each machine. The approach meant IT spent an\ninordinate amount of time on resource planning.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Google Cloud goes after the telco business with Anthos for Telecom and its Global Mobile Edge Cloud - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/google-cloud-goes-after-the-telco-business-with-anthos-for-telecom-and-its-global-mobile-edge-cloud/", "guid": "CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvMDUvZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkLWdvZXMtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLXRlbGNvLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdpdGgtYW50aG9zLWZvci10ZWxlY29tLWFuZC1pdHMtZ2xvYmFsLW1vYmlsZS1lZGdlLWNsb3VkL9IBigFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvMDUvZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkLWdvZXMtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLXRlbGNvLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdpdGgtYW50aG9zLWZvci10ZWxlY29tLWFuZC1pdHMtZ2xvYmFsLW1vYmlsZS1lZGdlLWNsb3VkL2FtcC8", "pubdate": "Thu, 05 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/google-cloud-goes-after-the-telco-business-with-anthos-for-telecom-and-its-global-mobile-edge-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cloud goes after the telco business with Anthos for Telecom and its Global Mobile Edge Cloud</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# Google Cloud goes after the telco business with Anthos for Telecom and its\nGlobal Mobile Edge Cloud\n\n[ Frederic Lardinois ](https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/)\n[@fredericl](https://twitter.com/fredericl) /  1 month\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190409_162410.jpg?w=533)\n\n[Google ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/google) Cloud today announced a\nnew solution for its telecom customers: Anthos for Telecom.

This is also the market where the open-source\n[OpenStack ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/openstack) project has\nremained the strongest.\n\nWhat's maybe even more important here is that Google is also launching a new\nservice called the Global Mobile Edge Cloud (GMEC). With this, telco companies\nwill be able to run their applications not just in Google's 20+ data center\nregions, but also in Google's [more than 130 edge\nlocations](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) around the world.\n\n\"We're basically giving you compute power on our edge, where previously it was\nonly for Google use, through the Anthos platform,\" explained Eyal Manor, the\nVP of Engineering for Anthos. \"The edge is very powerful and I think we will\nnow see substantially more innovation happening for applications that are\nlatency-sensitive. We've been investing in edge compute and edge networking\nfor a long time in Google over the years for the internal services. And we\nthink it's a fairly unique capability now to open it up for third-party\ncustomers.\"\n\nFor now, Google is only making this available to its teleco partners, with\nAT&T being the launch customers, but over time, Manor said, it'll likely open\nits edge cloud to other verticals, as well. Google also expects to be able to\nannounce other partners in the near future.\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04_1401.png)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04_1401.png)\n\nAs for Anthos for Telecom, Manor notes that this is very much what its\ncustomers are asking for, especially now that so many of their new\napplications are containerized.\n\n\"[Anthos] brings the best of cloud-as-a-service to our customers, wherever\nthey are, in multiple environments and provide the lock-in free environment\nwith the latest cloud tools,\" explained Manor. \"The goal is really to empower\ndevelopers and operators to move faster in a consistent way, so regardless of\nwhere you are, you don't have to train your technical staff. It works on-\npremise, it works on GCP and on other clouds. And that's what we hear from\ncustomers -- customers really like choice.\"\n\nIn the telecom industry, those customers also want to get higher up the stack\nand get consistency between their data centers and the edge -- and all of\nthat, of course, is meant to bring down the cost of running these networks and\nservices.\n\n\"We don't want to manage the [technology] we previously invested in for many\nyears because the upgrades were terribly expensive and slow for that. I hear\nthat consistently. And please Google, make this seem like a service in the\ncloud for us,\" Manor said.\n\nFor developers, Anthos also promises to provide the same development\nexperience, no matter where the application is deployed -- and Google now has\nan established network of partners that provides both solutions to developers\nas well as operators around Anthos. To this effect, Google is also launching\nnew partnerships with the Amdocs customer experience platform and Netcracker\ntoday.\n\n\"We\u2019re excited to unveil a new strategy today to help telecommunications\ncompanies innovate and accelerate their digital transformation through Google\nCloud,\" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in today's announcement. \"By\ncollaborating closely with leading telecoms, partners and customers, we can\ntransform the industry together and create better overall experiences for our\nusers globally.\"\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "European Commission makes big cloud data-sharing play -

Our strategy\ncovers everything from cybersecurity to critical infrastructures, digital\neducation to skills and democracy to media. I want digital Europe to reflect\nthe best of Europe \u2013 open, fair, diverse, democratic and confident.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for internal market, Thierry Breton (the ex-CEO of Atos), said:\n\u201cOur society is generating a huge wave of industrial and public data, which\nwill transform the way we produce, consume and live. I want European\nbusinesses and our many SMEs to access this data and create value for\nEuropeans \u2013 including developing artificial intelligence applications.\n\n\u201cEurope has everything it takes to lead the \u2018big data' race, and preserve its\ntechnological sovereignty, industrial leadership and economic competitiveness\nfor the benefit of European consumers.\u201d\n\nOver the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives in\ndigital:\n\n\u00b7 Technology that works for people;\n\n\u00b7 A fair and competitive economy; and\n\n\u00b7 An open, democratic and sustainable society.\n\nIn a white paper the Commission envisages a framework for trustworthy\nartificial intelligence, based on \u201cexcellence and trust\u201d. In partnership with\nthe private and the public sector, the aim is to mobilise resources along the\nentire value chain to create the right incentives to accelerate deployment of\nAI, including by smaller- and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nIt said clear rules need to address high-risk AI systems without putting too\nmuch burden on less risky ones. Strict EU rules for consumer protection, to\naddress unfair commercial practices and to protect personal data and privacy,\nwill continue to apply.\n\nFor \u201chigh-risk cases\u201d, such as in health, policing or transport, AI systems\nshould be transparent, traceable and guarantee human oversight, the Commission\nsaid. Unbiased data is needed to train high-risk systems to perform properly,\nand to ensure respect of fundamental rights, in particular non-discrimination,\nadded the Commission.\n\nWhile today, the use of facial recognition for remote biometric identification\nis generally prohibited and can only be used in exceptional, duly justified\nand proportionate cases - subject to safeguards and based on EU or national\nlaw - the Commission wants to launch a \u201cbroad debate\u201d about which\ncircumstances, if any, might justify wider use.\n\nFurther, the objective of the European data strategy is to make sure the EU\nbecomes a \u201crole model\u201d and a leader for a society empowered by data. For this,\nit aims at setting up a \u201ctrue European data space\u201d, a single market for data,\nto unlock unused data, allowing it to flow freely within the European Union\nand across sectors for the benefit of businesses, researchers and public\nadministrations.\n\nCitizens, businesses and organisations should be empowered to make better\ndecisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. That data should\nbe available to all, whether public or private, start-up or giant, the\nCommission said.\n\nTo achieve this, the Commission will first propose to establish the right\nregulatory framework regarding data governance, access and re-use between\nbusinesses, between businesses and government and within administrations.\n\nThis entails creating incentives for data sharing and establishing practical,\nfair and clear rules on data access and use - which comply with European\nvalues and rights such as personal data protection, consumer protection and\ncompetition rules. It also means making public sector data more widely\navailable by opening up \u201chigh-value datasets\u201d across the EU and allowing their\nre-use to innovate on top.\n\nRichard Baker, CEO at spatial data firm GeoSpock, said of the plans: \u201cThe EU\u2019s\nmove to create a single European market for data must be treated as a step in\nthe right direction.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is clearly trying to make up ground on US and Asian rivals in\ndigital innovation. However, the EU platform will suffer from the same\nfundamental challenges all other cloud platforms face \u2013 namely, the ability to\nscale and provide real-time insight.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cStoring data is only part of the challenge that must be solved. For\nthe EU data market to truly flourish, its platform must have the ability to\nindex all the data from the billions of varied touchpoints and make it\ninstantly available for flexible querying.\n\n\u201cAs the business community is slowly realising, having data is one thing, but\nextracting useful output that can guide actions is another. Hopefully, the EU\nwill heed the lessons from other global markets and seek to work with\ninnovative and agile companies to make our data work for us all.\u201d\n\nMichael Ingrassia, president and general counsel for data management firm\nTr\u016bata, said of the Commission's data-sharing strategy: \u201cWhat needs to be kept\nfront of mind in considering these proposals is the sensitive nature of\ncustomer data. Any data-sharing would need to be handled very thoughtfully to\nmake sure that the focus isn\u2019t solely on how the value in this data can be\nrealised by more than just a few tech giants \u2013 but also on how the rights of\nthe citizens can be respected.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cData can be the driver of growth and innovation. But the regulators\ndiscussing this should keep in mind that this isn\u2019t just data \u2013 there are\npeople behind this data. And those customers\u2019 trust in how that data is\nhandled must be respected, which would certainly include, among other\nmeasures, making sure that any data is properly anonymised before it is\nshared.\u201d\n\nOn this, Ingrassia said: \u201cTo achieve genuine anonymisation, best industry\npractice is to have an expert independently carry out the anonymisation using\ncutting edge technology and techniques.\u201d\n\nThe Commission also says it aims to support the development of the\ntechnological systems and the next generation of infrastructures that will\nenable the EU and all players to grasp the opportunities of the data economy.\nIt will contribute to investments in European High Impact projects on European\ndata spaces and trustworthy and energy efficient cloud infrastructures.\n\nFinally, it will launch sectoral specific actions, to build European data\nspaces in, for instance, industrial manufacturing, the green deal sector,\nmobility or health.\n\nThe Commission will also work to further narrow the digital skills gap among\nEuropeans, and explore how to give citizens better control over who can access\ntheir machine-generated data.\n\nGoing forward, the Commission will present later this year a Digital Services\nAct and a European Democracy Action Plan, and propose a review of the eIDAS\nregulation and strengthen cybersecurity by developing a Joint Cyber Unit.\n\n  * More On:\n  * [European Commission](https://data-economy.com/tag/european-commission/)\n  * [Data](https://data-economy.com/tag/data/)\n  *

beyond\n\n* * *\n\n**Global health crisis accelerates need, company responds.**\n\n[Linxdatacenter](https://www.linxdatacenter.com/), an international provider\nof data storage, cloud and telecom solutions, has created an IT toolkit that\nenables businesses to continue effective operations under quarantine \u2013 and\nafterward.\n\nEarlier, Linxdatacenter announced free-of-charge access to cloud services for\ncompanies whose business was suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes. For instance,\nthey can easily add remote desktops so their employees can continue to work\nwhile forced to stay at home.\n\nVia Linxdatacenter, businesses can use global networking services; connect\ntheir IT infrastructure in Russia and abroad; and link to the largest SDN\nproviders, traffic and content-exchange networks all over the world: (IX)\nEquinix, DE-CIX, London-IX and AMS-IX.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

With these points of presence, Linxdatacenter can organize the\nconnection to global providers and services in only one or two days.\n\nAs the owner of traffic exchange points at its own sites, Linxdatacenter helps\ncarriers lower-traffic latency. Connection to IX Linxdatacenter enables\ncompanies \u2013 with services deployed on such platforms as Amazon, Google and\nAzure \u2013 to build dedicated circuits to global cloud providers and further\nreduce the time to access their resources.\n\nThanks to Linxdatacenter connectivity with global providers, companies can set\nup virtual workplaces with maximum security on any platform they choose:\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Nutanix Xi Cloud,\nOracle Cloud, and others.\n\nLinx Remote Toolkit supports employees working off-site and staff hired\ntemporarily, as it allows the prompt launch of the whole complex of necessary\nsoftware: office and conference applications, a full set of security tools,\nand a secure VPN connection.\n\nThe remote-desktop service consists of terminal servers with RDP connection\nbased on the Linxdatacenter cloud, virtual workstations on Amazon WorkSpaces,\nand Microsoft Office 365 services in the cloud. It includes tools for\ncorporate data protection: secure VPN connection, information security tools,\nuser-device scanning, and multifactor authentication.  \n\nThe risk of infrastructure and data loss is particularly high in situations\nthat involve large-scale remote work. Linxdatacenter bases its backup tools on\nVeeam Software. Backup, recovery and replication \u2013 managed through a\nfunctional console \u2013 ensure reliable access to data and applications. Using\nLinxdatacenter cloud, companies can avoid the necessity of supporting their\nown external infrastructure for backup.\n\n\u201cBusinesses urgently need solutions for increasing IT capacity and circuit\nbandwidth. The load on circuits will continue to grow during the pandemic and\nafterwards. To take just one example, companies that traditionally operated\noffline are now going online with videoconferences. Whoever thought that\nsports studios would have to start digital training to stay in business?\n\n\u201cI am sure that our Remote Toolkit will help many companies ride out this\nstorm, and even transform their businesses for the future,\u201d says Olga\nSokolova, General Director, Linxdatacenter.\n\n* * *\n\n**About _Linxdatacenter_**\n\n_Linxdatacenter, with headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is a global\nprovider of high-quality colocation, cloud and connectivity solutions for\nbusiness.

These include the launch of new [premium\nplans](https://www.atlassian.com/software/premium) for more of its products,\nas well as the addition of a free tier for all of the company's services that\ndidn't already offer one. Atlassian now also offers discounted cloud pricing\nfor academic institutions and nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe company previously announced its premium plans for Jira Software Cloud and\n[Confluence ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/confluence-2) Cloud. Now, it\nis adding Jira Service Desk to this lineup, and chances are it'll add more of\nits services over time. The premium plan adds a 99.9% update SLA, unlimited\nstorage and additional support. Until now, Atlassian sold these products\nsolely based on the number of users, but didn't offer a specific enterprise\nplan.\n\nAs Harsh Jawharkar, the head of go-to-market for Cloud Platform at Atlassian,\ntold me, many of its larger customers, who often ran the company's products on\ntheir own servers before, are now looking to move to the cloud and hand over\nto Atlassian the day-to-day operations of these services. That's in part\nbecause they are more comfortable with the idea of moving to the cloud at this\npoint -- and because Atlassian probably knows how to run its own services\nbetter than anybody else.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1877855,1877858,1877853,1877852,1877860\"]\n\nFor these companies, Atlassian is also introducing a number of new features\ntoday. Those include soon-to-launch data residency controls for companies that\nneed to ensure that their data stays in a certain geographic region, as well\nas the ability to run Jira and Confluence Cloud behind customized URLs that\nalign with a company's brand, which will launch in early access in 2020. Maybe\nmore important, though, are features to Atlassian Access, the company's\ncommand center that helps enterprises manage its cloud products. Access now\nsupports single sign-on with Google Cloud Identity and [Microsoft\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft) Active Directory Federation\nServices, for example. The company is also partnering with [McAfee\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/mcafee) and [Bitglass\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitglass) to offer additional advanced\nsecurity features and launch a cross-product audit log. Enterprise admins will\nalso soon get access to a new dashboard that will help them understand how\nAtlassian's tools are being used across the organization.\n\nBut that's not all. The company is also launching new tools to make customer\nmigration to its cloud products easier, with initial support for Confluence\nand Jira support coming later this year. There's also new extended cloud trial\nlicenses, which a lot of customers have asked for, Jawharkar told me, because\nthe relatively short trial periods the company previously offered weren't\nquite long enough for companies to fully understand their needs.\n\nThis is a big slew of updates for Atlassian -- maybe its biggest enterprise-\ncentric release since the company's launch. It has clearly reached a point\nwhere it had to start offering these enterprise features if it wanted to grow\nits market and bring more of these large companies on board. In its early\ndays, Atlassian mostly grew by selling directly to teams within a company.\nThese days, it has to focus a bit more on selling to executives as it tries to\nbring more enterprises on board -- and those companies have very specific\nneeds that the company didn't have to address before. Today's launches clearly\nshow that it is now doing so -- at least for its cloud-based products.\n\nThe company isn't forgetting about other users either, though. It'll still\noffer entry-level plans for smaller teams and it's now adding free tiers to\nproducts like Jira Software, Confluence, Jira Service Desk and Jira Core.\nThey'll join [Trello, ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/trello) [Bitbucket\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitbucket) and Opsgenie, which already\nfeature free versions. Going forward, academic institutions will receive 50%\noff their cloud subscriptions and nonprofits will receive 75% off.\n\nIt's obvious that Atlassian is putting a lot of emphasis on its cloud\nservices. It's not doing away with its self-hosted products anytime, but its\nfocus is clearly elsewhere. The company itself started this process [a few\nyears ago](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-\njourney/) and a lot of this work is now coming to fruition. As Anu Bharadwaj,\nthe head of Cloud Platform at Atlassian, told me, this move to a fully cloud-\nnative stack enabled many of today's announcements, and she expects that it'll\nbring a lot of new customers to its cloud-based services.\n\n> [Atlassian's two-year cloud\n> journey](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-\n> journey/)\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Pentagon deal to boost Microsoft's position in cloud computing: analysts - Reuters", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pentagon-jedi/pentagon-deal-to-boost-microsofts-position-in-cloud-computing-analysts-idUSKBN1X71RG", "guid": "CAIiED7KPChql7xiyu2Iws_tmTgqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMOpn", "pubdate": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 06:14:47 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pentagon-jedi/pentagon-deal-to-boost-microsofts-position-in-cloud-computing-analysts-idUSKBN1X71RG\" target=\"_blank\">Pentagon deal to boost Microsoft's position in cloud computing: analysts</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Reuters</font>", "source": "Reuters", "body": "Discover Thomson Reuters\n\n[Financial](https://www.refinitiv.com/en)[Government\nSolutions](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/government-\nsolutions.html)[Legal](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/products-\nservices/legal.html)[Reuters News\nAgency](//www.reutersagency.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=reutersdotcom&utm_campaign=site-\nreferral&utm_content=united_states&utm_term=0)[Risk Management\nSolutions](https://risk.thomsonreuters.com/en.html)[Tax &\nAccounting](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/tax-\naccounting.html)[Blog: Answers\nOn](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/)[Innovation @ Thomson\nReuters](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en.html)\n\n[Directory of sites](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html)\n\n[Login](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html)\n\n[Contact](https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-\nReuters)\n\n[Support](https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)\n\n[](/)\n\n  * [Business](/finance)\n  * [Markets](/finance/markets)\n  * [World](/news/world)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [TV](/video)\n  * More\n\n![Flag of United\nStates](//static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/CKB-22938-b44/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png)\n\nUnited States\n\n[Technology News](/news/archive/technologyNews)\n\nOctober 28, 2019 / 4:31 PM / 5 months ago\n\n# Pentagon deal to boost Microsoft's position in cloud computing: analysts\n\n3 Min Read\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's ([AMZN.O](//www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O))\nfirm grip on the cloud computing market could be threatened by Microsoft\nCorp's ([MSFT.O](//www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O)) multi-billion dollar\ncontract with the Pentagon, Wall Street analysts said on Monday.\n\n![](//s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445897761&r=LYNXMPEF9R19W&w=20)\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen next to a cloud in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, U.S. on June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\n\nLast week, Microsoft won the Pentagon contract termed Joint Enterprise Defense\nInfrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, that will be worth up to $10 billion over a\nperiod of 10 years, beating out favorite Amazon's AWS.\n\nShares of Microsoft rose as much as 3.4% to a record high of $145.67 on\nMonday.\n\n\"Bottom line, the contract is a significant win for Microsoft and vaults Azure\nforward in the cloud platform wars,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy said.\n\nAmazon's Amazon Web Services currently holds about 32% of the cloud computing\nmarket, while Microsoft's Azure has about 18%, according to research firm\nCanalys.\n\nWhile AWS contributes nearly 13% to Amazon's total net sales, Azure accounts\nfor about 33% of Microsoft's revenue and are both a major cash cow for the\ncompanies.\n\nFriday's decision came after months of controversy and protest over the\nprocess for awarding the deal and even drawing the attention of President\nDonald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon, long considered the\nfrontrunner.\n\nAnalysts at brokerage firm Compass Point said the deal was a \"significant\nvictory\" for Microsoft over AWS and added that Amazon could challenge the\ndecision.\n\n\"We expect a degree of handwringing among Congressional Democrats given the\npolitical and practical dimensions of this issue, but our sense is that\nlawmakers are unlikely to wade too deeply into these waters,\" Compass Point's\nMarshall Senk said.\n\nBrokerages Mizuho and Independent Research raised their price target on the\nMicrosoft stock at the prospect of the company getting a boost from the\ncontract.\n\n\"In the end, the fact that Azure was chosen as the sole provider for this\nimportant project is a testament to just how far it has come over the past\ncouple of years,\" said Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz, who raised his price\ntarget by $8 to $160.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives noted that the deal helps Microsoft gain a bigger\nchunk of an estimated $1 trillion of next decade cloud business and $100\nbillion of U.S. government business.\n\n(This version corrects paragraph 5 to say \"cloud\", not \"could\")\n\nReporting by Ayanti Bera, Tanvi Mehta and Ambhini Aishwarya in Bengaluru;\nEditing by Maju Samuel\n\nOur Standards:[The Thomson Reuters Trust\nPrinciples.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n0 : 0\n\n  * narrow-browser-and-phone\n  * medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\n  * landscape-tablet\n  * medium-wide-browser\n  * wide-browser-and-larger\n  * medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\n  * medium-wide-browser-and-larger\n  * above-phone\n  * portrait-tablet-and-above\n  * above-portrait-tablet\n  * landscape-tablet-and-above\n  * landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\n  * portrait-tablet-and-below\n  * landscape-tablet-and-below\n\n  * [Apps](//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile)\n  * [Newsletters](//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe)\n  * [Advertise with Us](//sales.reuters.com/en/ )\n  * [Advertising Guidelines](//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines)\n  * [Cookies](//info.evidon.com/pub_info/285)\n  * [Terms of Use](//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html)\n\n  * [](https://twitter.com/reuters )\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/Reuters)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo)\n  * [](https://instagram.com/reuters/)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/)\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

We aren't talking\nabout bare metal servers offered directly by Google Cloud here, though.\nInstead, we're talking about a solution that enterprises can use to run their\nspecialized workloads on certified hardware that's co-located in the Google\nCloud data centers and directly connect them to Google Cloud's suite of other\nservices. The main workload that makes sense for this kind of setup is\ndatabases, Google notes, and specifically Oracle Database.\n\nBare Metal Solution is, as the name implies, a fully integrated and fully\nmanaged solution for setting up this kind of infrastructure. It involves a\ncompletely managed hardware infrastructure that includes servers and the rest\nof the data center facilities like power and cooling; support contracts with\nGoogle Cloud and billing are handled through Google's systems, as well as an\nSLA. The software that's deployed on those machines is managed by the customer\n-- not Google.\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png)\n\nThe overall idea, though, is clearly to make it easier for enterprises with\nspecialized workloads that can't easily be migrated to the cloud to still\nbenefit from the cloud-based services that need access to the data from these\nsystems. Machine learning is an obvious example, but Google also notes that\nthis provides these companies with a bridge to slowly modernize their tech\ninfrastructure in general (where \"modernize\" tends to mean \"move to the\ncloud\").\n\n\"These specialized workloads often require certified hardware and complicated\nlicensing and support agreements,\" Google writes. \"This solution provides a\npath to modernize your application infrastructure landscape, while maintaining\nyour existing investments and architecture. With Bare Metal Solution, you can\nbring your specialized workloads to Google Cloud, allowing you access and\nintegration with GCP services with minimal latency.\"\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/specialized_workloads_2x.png)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/specialized_workloads_2x.png)\n\nBecause this service is co-located with Google Cloud, there are no separate\ningress and egress charges for data that moves between Bare Metal Solution and\nGoogle Cloud in the same region.\n\nThe servers for this solution, which are certified to run a wide range of\napplications (including Oracle Database) range from dual-socket 16-core\nsystems with 384 GB of RAM to quad-socket servers with 112 cores and 3072 GB\nof RAM. Pricing is on a monthly basis, with a preferred term length of 36\nmonths.\n\nObviously, this isn't the kind of solution that you self-provision, so the\nonly way to get started -- and get pricing information -- is to talk to\nGoogle's sales team. But this is clearly the kind of service that we should\nexpect from Google Cloud, which is heavily focused on providing as many\nenterprise-ready services as possible.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Druva Expands Partner Program Into Germany, Austria, Switzerland - Channel Futures", "link":

Initially, Compass\nwas available in only a few select European nations, [Timm\nHoyt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timm-hoyt-43a853a/), vice president of\nglobal partners and alliances for Druva, told Channel Futures.\n\nAs part of the expansion, the company has named [Bernd\nWachtler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernd-wachtler-7b19241/) as its new\nregional leader of the channel program in DACH. Wachtler will work to grow the\nprogram and the Druva data backup business in the area. Druva\u2019s [cloud data\nprotection](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/28/data-\nmanagement-and-governance-the-changing-data-landscape/#7b4c0e9b5d79) products\nand services are used by business customers to protect and manage their data\nwhile migrating to the cloud and maintaining regulatory compliance.\n\nThe extension of Druva Compass in the region means that partners will gain\naccess to enablement resources, accreditation curriculum, co-marketing\nopportunities and more, according to the company.\n\nSign up for Channel Futures\u2019 [new EMEA\nnewsletter](https://www.channelfutures.com/subscribe-to-newsletters), where we\nfeature news and analysis involving companies based in Europe, the Middle East\nand Africa, as well as those doing business in that region.  \n---  \n  \n![Druva's Timm Hoyt](https://www.channelfutures.com/files/2019/06/Hoyt-\nTimm_Druva.jpg)\n\nDruva's Timm Hoyt\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of European countries, including Germany, are investing\nbillions to improve digital infrastructure and networking, and are only making\nit easier for enterprises to move more of their business to the cloud,\u201d said\nHoyt. \u201cAdditionally, the investments in Germany that AWS announced in\nSeptember are a clear leading indicator that this market is ready for a cloud-\nfirst data protection offering. Taken all together, there is a clear demand\nfrom prospects and partners in the region for this sort of offering and we\nfeel now was the right time to expand Compass even further.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s continuing growth is a sign of success for the Compass partner\norganization, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting great feedback from those already taking advantage of the new\nresources and are now seeing strong demand from partners in other countries,\nincluding Germany and others. Partners are core to our success, accounting for\nthe majority of our sales \u2014 and Druva Compass is designed to help these\npartners and their customers thrive.\u201d\n\nWachtler has more than 20 years of management experience with direct and\npartner sales organizations.\n\n\u201cHe will be closely aligned with our key strategic partners, including AWS and\nVMware, to expand solution selling opportunities for our resellers, system\nintegrators and MSPs,\u201d said Hoyt. \u201cBernd has a unique background working with\nand for these types of organizations during his career, which will make him a\nvaluable resource for our partners to collaborate with.\u201d\n\n![Druva's bernd\nWachtler](https://www.channelfutures.com/files/2020/02/Wachtler-\nBernd_Druva.jpg)\n\nDruva's Bernd Wachtler\n\nWachtler comes to Druva from Veritas, where he led the cloud migration and\ndata resiliency practice for Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, as well\nas for other German-speaking countries, said Hoyt. Previously he held various\ndirect and channel sales positions at major storage and data management\ncompanies including Dell EMC, IBM, Brocade, Seagate and Fusion-io.\n\nDan Olds, an IT analyst with [Gabriel Consulting\nGroup](http://gabrielconsultinggroup.com/), told Channel Futures that Druva\u2019s\nadvance into the DACH countries is a good move for the company and its\ncustomers.\n\n\u201cFor customers, it gives them a new and easy-to-use alternative for cloud\nbackup and disaster recovery,\u201d including [ransomware\nprotection](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-attacks-are-now-\ntargeting-industrial-control-systems/), \u201cwhich is starting to become a must-\nhave feature these days,\u201d said Olds. \u201cFor the company, this opens up a new\nterritory that is full of medium- and large-sized organizations that will\ndefinitely see the need for Druva\u2019s SaaS solutions. VARs in the DACH area\nshould take a close look at Druva\u2019s value proposition with an eye towards\nreselling Druva services as this will give them more capabilities to use to\nhelp solve the problems of both new and existing customers.\u201d\n\nAnother analyst, Rob Enderle of [Enderle\nGroup](https://www.enderlegroup.com/), said that Druva\u2019s Compass partner\nprogram appears to be well managed and tightly executed.\n\n\u201cThis is critical for any partner program because, done right, they provide\nsignificant value to customers and sales momentum for the platform they are\ntied to,\u201d said Enderle. \u201cAs we have seen with most well executed partner\nprograms, I expect this effort will significantly improve Druva\u2019s market\nposition and customer satisfaction over time.\u201d\n\nTags: [MSPs ](https://www.channelfutures.com/msps) [VARs/SIs\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/vars-sis) [Channel Programs\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/strategy/channel-programs) [Cloud\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/technologies/cloud-2) [Data Centers\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/technologies/data-centers) [EMEA\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/strategy/emea) [Strategy\n](https://www.channelfutures.com/strategy)\n\n### Related\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![Pivot](https://www.channelfutures.com/files/2020/03/Pivot-110x110.jpg) Palo Alto Networks Making Second SD-WAN Pivot with CloudGenix Acquisition This acquisition pulls Palo Alto Networks closer to the Ciscos and Symantecs of the world. ](https://www.channelfutures.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/palo-alto-networks-making-second-sd-wan-pivot-with-cloudgenix-acquisition \"Palo Alto Networks Making Second SD-WAN Pivot with CloudGenix Acquisition\")\n  * [ ![Conference Event](https://www.channelfutures.com/files/2019/06/Conference-Event-110x110.jpg) IT Conference Rescheduling Sees Light of Day Many COVID-19 conference cancelations are in the rearview mirror.

These new instances,\nwhich are meant for general-purpose workloads, offer a significant cost\nbenefit, with saving of around 31% compared to the current N1 general-purpose\ninstances.\n\nThe E2 family runs on standard [Intel\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/intel) and AMD chips, but as Google\nnotes, they also use a custom CPU scheduler \"that dynamically maps virtual CPU\nand memory to physical CPU and memory to maximize utilization.\" In addition,\nthe new system is also smarter about where it places VMs, with the added\nflexibility to move them to other hosts as necessary. To achieve all of this,\nGoogle built a custom CPU scheduler \"with significantly better latency\nguarantees and co-scheduling behavior than Linux\u2019s default scheduler.\" The new\nscheduler promises sub-microsecond wake-up latencies and faster context\nswitching.\n\nThat gives Google efficiency gains that it then passes on to users in the form\nof these savings. Chances are, we will see similar updates to Google's other\ninstances families over time.\n\nIt's interesting to note that Google is clearly willing to put this offering\nagainst that of its competitors. \"Unlike comparable options from other cloud\nproviders, E2 VMs can sustain high CPU load without artificial throttling or\ncomplicated pricing,\" the company writes in today's announcement. \"This\nperformance is the result of years of investment in the Compute Engine\nvirtualization stack and dynamic resource management capabilities.\" It'll be\ninteresting to see some benchmarks that pit the E2 family against similar\nofferings from AWS and Azure.\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/google-e2.png)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/google-e2.png)\n\nAs usual, Google offers a set of predefined instance configurations, ranging\nfrom 2 vCPUs with 8 GB of memory to 16 vCPUs and 128 GB of memory. For very\nsmall workloads, Google Cloud is also launching a set of E2-based instances\nthat are similar to the existing f1-micro and g1-small machine types. These\nfeature 2 vCPUs, 1 to 4 GB of RAM and a baseline CPU performance that ranges\nfrom the equivalent of 0.125 vCPUs to 0.5 vCPUs.\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/e2-small.png)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/e2-small.png)\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Oracle opens another five cloud regions to reduce latency - Data Economy", "link": "https://data-economy.com/oracle-opens-another-five-cloud-regions-to-reduce-latency/", "guid": "CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZGF0YS1lY29ub215LmNvbS9vcmFjbGUtb3BlbnMtYW5vdGhlci1maXZlLWNsb3VkLXJlZ2lvbnMtdG8tcmVkdWNlLWxhdGVuY3kv0gEA", "pubdate": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://data-economy.com/oracle-opens-another-five-cloud-regions-to-reduce-latency/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle opens another five cloud regions to reduce latency</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Data Economy</font>", "source": "Data Economy", "body": ""}, {"item": "Zenlayer provides direct edge connections to the Google Cloud - Data Economy", "link": "https://data-economy.com/zenlayer-provides-direct-edge-connections-to-the-google-cloud/", "guid": "CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZGF0YS1lY29ub215LmNvbS96ZW5sYXllci1wcm92aWRlcy1kaXJlY3QtZWRnZS1jb25uZWN0aW9ucy10by10aGUtZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkL9IBAA", "pubdate": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://data-economy.com/zenlayer-provides-direct-edge-connections-to-the-google-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Zenlayer provides direct edge connections to the Google Cloud</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Data Economy</font>", "source": "Data Economy", "body": ""}, {"item": "AvePoint lands $200M investment to expand market for Microsoft cloud governance tools - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/avepoint-grabs-200m-series-c-for-microsoft-cloud-governance-tools/", "guid": "CAIiEK_CrdX37UOhzOxlZaMRabcqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowlIEBMLEXMOc_", "pubdate": "Wed, 08 Jan 2020 13:51:38 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/avepoint-grabs-200m-series-c-for-microsoft-cloud-governance-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">AvePoint lands $200M investment to expand market for Microsoft cloud governance tools</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# AvePoint lands $200M investment to expand market for Microsoft cloud\ngovernance tools\n\n[ Ron Miller ](https://techcrunch.com/author/) 3 months\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-737369061-1.jpg?w=568)\n\nWhile Microsoft cloud services such as SharePoint, Microsoft Teams and Office\n365 are used widely by large organizations, the products don't come standard\nwith an enterprise-grade control layer.

The round\nbrings the total raised to $294 million, according to the company.\n\nThe company says that the equity investment has a couple of purposes. First of\nall it wants to provide some liquidity for long-time investors. Secondly, it\nwants capital for company expansion.\n\nSpecifically, it provides a set of governance and migration services for\nMicrosoft SharePoint, Teams, Office 365 and other Microsoft SaaS products. The\ncompany has been around for 18 years, but transitioned about five years ago to\nprotecting online services, chief marketing officer Dux Raymond Sy explained.\nPrior to that it concentrated on on-prem services like SharePoint backup.\n\nToday, [AvePoint ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/avepoint) takes care of\na few key management tasks. First of all, it provides a policy layer on top of\nOffice 365, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint to give companies the ability to\nenforce usage rules across these products. For instance, it could define the\ntypes of files an employee can share in Teams.\n\nIn addition, the company provides backup for the three services and others\nlike Microsoft Dynamics to aid in disaster recovery, and finally it has\nmigration tools to move data from a related cloud service to a Microsoft cloud\nservice.\n\nFor example, AvePoint could help move documents from Google Drive to Office\n365 or Slack data to Microsoft Teams.\n\nSy says the company has been growing rapidly, with four consecutive quarters\nof record growth, which he said works out to about 40% year over year growth.\nAvePoint currently has 1,250 employees serving 16,000 customers. Overall, it\nis helping to protect 7 million Microsoft cloud service users around the\nworld, but it has a long-term, rather ambitious goal of adding more than\n40,000 new customers.\n\nIt hopes to expand its market further by adding new services to sell to\nexisting customers, while expanding aggressively into the SMB market. It also\nwants to enhance relationships with channel partners to sell AvePoint on its\nbehalf. It already has a number of channel partners, including Ingram Micro,\nSynnex and TechData.\n\nThe new investment should help the company invest in the engineering, sales,\ncustomer service and partner relations that this level of expansion will no\ndoubt require.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "M-Files reports big cloud growth in information management - Data Economy", "link": "https://data-economy.com/m-files-reports-big-cloud-growth-in-information-management/", "guid": "CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZGF0YS1lY29ub215LmNvbS9tLWZpbGVzLXJlcG9ydHMtYmlnLWNsb3VkLWdyb3d0aC1pbi1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L9IBAA", "pubdate": "Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://data-economy.com/m-files-reports-big-cloud-growth-in-information-management/\" target=\"_blank\">M-Files reports big cloud growth in information management</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Data Economy</font>", "source": "Data Economy", "body": ""}, {"item": "Cyral announces $11M Series A to help protect data in cloud - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/cyral-announces-11m-series-a-to-help-protect-data-in-cloud/", "guid": "CAIiEC63Oe4OGwjNXg8FgbrsXtUqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowlIEBMLEXMOc_", "pubdate": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:24:11 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/cyral-announces-11m-series-a-to-help-protect-data-in-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyral announces $11M Series A to help protect data in cloud</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# Cyral announces $11M Series A to help protect data in cloud\n\n[ Ron Miller ](https://techcrunch.com/author/) 3 months\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-532029225.jpg?w=536)\n\n[Cyral](http://www.cyral.com/), an early-stage startup that helps protect data\nstored in cloud repositories, announced an $11 million Series A today. The\ncompany also revealed a previous undisclosed $4.1 million angel investment,\nmaking the total $15.1 million.\n\nThe Series A was led by Redpoint Ventures. A.Capital Ventures, Costanoa VC,\nFirebolt, SV Angel and Trifecta Capital also participated in on the round.\n\nCyral co-founder and CEO Manav Mital says the company's product acts as a\nsecurity layer on top of cloud data repositories -- whether databases, data\nlakes, data warehouse or other data repository -- helping identify issues like\nfaulty configurations or anomalous activity.\n\nMital says that unlike most security data products of this ilk, Cyral doesn't\nuse an agent or watch points to try to detect signals that indicate something\nis happening to the data. Instead, he says that Cyral is a security layer\nattached directly to the data.\n\n\"The core innovation of Cyral is to put a layer of visibility attached right\nto the data endpoint, right to the interface where application services and\nusers talk to the data endpoint, and in real time see the communication,\"\nMital explained.\n\nAs an example, he says that Cyral could detect that someone has suddenly\nstarted scanning rows of credit card data, or that someone was trying to\nconnect to a database on an unencrypted connection. In each of these cases,\nCyral would detect the problem, and depending on the configuration, send an\nalert to the customer's security team to deal with the problem, or\nautomatically shut down access to the database before informing the security\nteam.\n\nIt's still early days for Cyral, with 15 employees and a handful of early\naccess customers. Mital says for this round he's working on bringing a product\nto market that's well-designed and easy to use.\n\nHe says that people get the problem he's trying to solve. \"We could walk into\nany company and they are all worried about this problem. So for us getting\npeople interested has not been an issue. We just want to make sure we build an\namazing product,\" he said.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "AWS Outposts begins to take shape to bring the cloud into the data center - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/aws-outposts-begins-to-take-shape-to-bring-the-cloud-into-the-data-center/", "guid": "CAIiED42GrDWJds0JHSlpZhkcCUqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowlIEBMLEXMOc_", "pubdate": "Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:38:42 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/aws-outposts-begins-to-take-shape-to-bring-the-cloud-into-the-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Outposts begins to take shape to bring the cloud into the data center</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# AWS Outposts begins to take shape to bring the cloud into the data center\n\n[ Ron Miller ](https://techcrunch.com/author/) 4 months\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_3894-1.jpg?w=504)\n\nWhen AWS [announced Outposts](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/aws-is-\nbringing-the-cloud-on-prem-with-outposts/) last year, a private cloud hardware\nstack they install in your data center, there were a lot of unanswered\nquestions. This week at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, the company announced\ngeneral availability as the vision for this approach began to become clearer.\n\nAWS CEO Andy Jassy, speaking at a press conference earlier today, said there\nare certain workloads like running a factory that need compute resources to be\nclose because of low-latency requirements. That's where Outposts could play\nwell, and where similar existing solutions in his opinion fell short because\nthere wasn't a smooth connection between the on-prem hardware and the cloud.\n\n\"We tried to rethink this with a different approach,\" he said. \"We thought\nabout it more as trying to distribute AWS on premises. With Outposts, you have\nracks of AWS servers that have compute, storage, database and analytics and\nmachine learning on them. You get to decide what composition you want and we\ndeliver that to you,\" he said.\n\nThe hardware is equipped with a slew of services, including Amazon Elastic\nCompute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon Virtual Private\nCloud, Amazon ECS, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service and Amazon EMR.\nConspicuously missing is S3 storage, but Amazon promises that will be coming\nin 2020 with other services on deck, as well.\n\nMake no mistake, the world's premiere cloud infrastructure vendor will be\ninstalling a rack of hardware inside your data center. AWS has formed a team\ninside the company to handle installation, monitoring and management of the\nequipment.\n\nThe easy way to think about this would be that it's a way for companies that\nmight be afraid to go all-in on the cloud to start experimenting with a cloud-\nlike environment, which you can manage from an AWS console or VMware\n(beginning next year). Yet an Amazon spokesperson indicated that many\ncompanies like Morningstar and Philips Healthcare, both of which are already\nAWS public cloud customers, are choosing Outposts because it gives these\ncustomers ultra-low latency, almost like a hyper-local availability zone.\n\nThese customers need to keep compute resources as close as possible to run a\nparticular set of jobs. While a local availability zone like the one announced\n[for Los Angeles yesterday](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/aws-launches-\nnew-local-zone-in-la/) could also suffice for this, Outposts could help when\nthere isn't a local option.\n\nCustomers can sign up for Outposts in a similar fashion to any EC2 instance,\nbut instead of spinning it up in the cloud, an order goes to the Outposts\nteam, and it gets racked, stacked and installed on prem.\n\nFrom then on, Amazon still handles the management just as it does with a\npublic cloud instance. For now, installation and management is being handled\nby an internal Amazon team, but over time they plan to work with systems\nintegrators to help handle some of that workload.\n\n> [AWS is bringing the cloud on prem with\n> Outposts](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/aws-is-bringing-the-cloud-on-\n> prem-with-outposts/)\n\n[![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aws-\nreinvent-2019-banner.png)](https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2019)\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Muy raises $15M to grow its new cloud kitchen concept - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/muy-raises-15m-to-grow-its-new-cloud-kitchen-concept/", "guid": "CAIiENvZPq6GOeu9brpeO4JhlpgqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowlIEBMLEXMOc_", "pubdate": "Wed, 30 Oct 2019 18:05:45 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/muy-raises-15m-to-grow-its-new-cloud-kitchen-concept/\" target=\"_blank\">Muy raises $15M to grow its new cloud kitchen concept</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# Muy raises $15M to grow its new cloud kitchen concept\n\n[ Anna Escher ](https://techcrunch.com/author/anna-escher/)\n[@https://www.twitter.com/annaescher](https://twitter.com/https://www.twitter.com/annaescher)\n/  5 months\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/VAS_0802-1.jpg?w=601)\n\nThe cloud kitchen craze has reached Latin America. Food tech startup\n[Muy](https://home.muy.com.co/#/) landed a fresh $15 million Series B to\nexpand into Mexico and soon Brazil. The service is currently operative in\nColombia.\n\nMuy is a \u201ccloud kitchen meets Chipotle,\u201d says one investor. The company\ndescribes itself as a virtual kitchen and smart chef system that uses AI to\nproduce food based on forecasts of demand, which can help to reduce food\nwaste. Muy, translated from Spanish to English as \u201cvery,\" allows users to\nplace personalized orders in one of Muy\u2019s physical restaurants or through a\nmobile app. Muy's concept also exists as 20 physical dining locations offering\nwhat it says are quick, fresh and personalized dishes. Founder Jose Calderon\nsays Muy is serving more than 200,000 dishes per month.\n\nThe round was led by Mexico-based investor ALLVP, with previous investor Seaya\nreturning. The $15 million Series B brings MUY\u2019s total funding to $20.5\nmillion.\n\nCalderon is no newcomer to the takeaway experience space. He previously raised\n$47.7 million for a Colombian online food ordering startup called Domicilios,\nwhich he [exited to Delivery\nHero](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clickdelivery#section-overview).\n\nThe explosion of delivery apps has kept options competitive for customers not\nonly in the U.S. but across Latin America. The congested highways of S\u00e3o\nPaulo, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and beyond are filled with motor couriers running\ndeliveries with Rappi, UberEATS and the like.\n\nCalderon notes that cloud kitchens are poised to make on-demand ordering and\ndelivery more efficient in these high-density cities due to the long commute\ntimes that keep the growing middle class out of their homes for extended\nperiods of 12 hours or more.\n\n![VAS2539](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/VAS2539.jpg)\n\nA MUY customer orders at one of the company's physical locations in Colombia\n\nAlternatives like full service restaurants can be prohibitively expensive and\ntime consuming, and traditional casual restaurants don\u2019t meet quality\nstandards. A large part of the market, around 40%, brings a lunch to work,\nsays Calderon. But as disposable income increases, he predicts that more\npeople will avoid cooking at home and will opt for faster and higher-quality\noptions like Muy.\n\nCloud kitchens -- the fully equipped, shared, commercial grade [spaces for\nrestaurant owners](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/technology/uber-eats-\nghost-kitchens.html) -- have left [U.S. investors\nbalking](https://www.ft.com/content/5c104e5e-7aea-11e9-8b5c-33d0560f039c).\nJournalists have described these virtual spaces as [\u201cghost kitchens\u201d\n](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/technology/uber-eats-ghost-\nkitchens.html)and many have noted the threat they pose to independently owned\nrestaurants. My colleague Danny Crichton wrote that [\u201ccloud kitchens are the\nWeWork for restaurant kitchens,\u201d](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/cloud-\nkitchens-is-an-oxymoron/) adding that suddenly sharable kitchen space will\nlead to bidding wars between these virtual food brands.\n\nThis rhetoric isn\u2019t hindering the rise of cloud kitchens and the services that\nsupport them from launching in the U.S. and down to Latin America. According\nto Calderon, the food service market opportunity in Latin America will reach\n$270 billion by 2021.\n\nThe founder also notes that the Latin America market is highly fragmented; the\ntop 10 chains only hold around 5% of market share in comparison to countries\nlike the U.S. where this figure reaches 24%. \u201cLarge players will consolidate\nand win, and small ones will face pressure,\u201d he says.\n\nLarger incumbents have already begun to dip into the cloud kitchen\nopportunity. Earlier this year, Amazon took a [$575 million bite into\nDeliveroo](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/amazon-takes-a-bite-into-\ndeliveroo/), which opened its first shared kitchen in Paris in 2018. City\nStorage Systems, the holding company of CloudKitchens, was backed with a [$150\nmillion controlling stake](https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-\nups/article/2184598/former-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-said-plot-china-comeback-\nshared) from Uber founder and ex-CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nFor better or worse, delivery apps and cloud kitchens are revolutionizing the\nway we eat in the U.S., Asia and now in Latin America. The winners among the\nvarious global delivery apps, cloud kitchens and controlling incumbents have\nyet to emerge, but what we do know is that everyone needs to eat lunch.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Druva Gives Channel Partners the Keys to Cloud with Druva Compass -

The topic that has undoubtedly come up in any company boardroom\nwhere data is concerned.\n\nGoogle Cloud has chosen to be one step ahead of the game carrying its digital\ntransformation strategy in a sack over the company\u2019s shoulder, ready to\ndistribute across the globe like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.\n\n\u201cThousands of Googlers are working hard every day to give you this platform to\nhelp you innovate,\u201d Kurian says.\n\n\u201cWe give you this platform to paint a new vision for your company -- to\nimagine what was once considered impossible, and to transform the way you\nserve customers in every industry.\n\n\"We\u2019re investing very aggressively to ensure that you have the right sales\nresources, customer service resources, as well as product innovations, to take\nyour organisation into the future.\u201d\n\nKurian has taken over Google Cloud like a vengeful storm, hitting headlines,\nmaking announcements and signing definitive acquisition agreements since his\nappointment at the beginning of the year.

As\nit stands, Google Cloud is currently live in 20 regions around the world and\n61 availability zones.\n\nSix of those are in Europe, and the cloud giants\u2019 are set to introduce five\nnew regions (under previously announced plans to open data centres in Las\nVegas, Salt Lake City, Warsaw, Jakarta and Seoul).\n\n* * *\n\n**Join the Debate**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

We offer four important capabilities: a platform, AI\nbuilding blocks, an AI Hub, which provides one-click deployment of models, and\nAutoML, which makes it much easier for people to build AI models,\u201d he\nconcludes.\n\n\u201cExplainable AI allows you, a customer, who is using AI in an enterprise\ncontext or an enterprise business process, to understand why the AI\ninfrastructure generated a particular outcome.\n\n\"So for instance, if you\u2019re using AI for credit scoring, you want to be able\nto understand why the model didn\u2019t reject a particular credit application and\naccept another one.

beyond\n\n* * *\n\n**Global health crisis accelerates need, company responds.**\n\n[Linxdatacenter](https://www.linxdatacenter.com/), an international provider\nof data storage, cloud and telecom solutions, has created an IT toolkit that\nenables businesses to continue effective operations under quarantine \u2013 and\nafterward.\n\nEarlier, Linxdatacenter announced free-of-charge access to cloud services for\ncompanies whose business was suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes. For instance,\nthey can easily add remote desktops so their employees can continue to work\nwhile forced to stay at home.\n\nVia Linxdatacenter, businesses can use global networking services; connect\ntheir IT infrastructure in Russia and abroad; and link to the largest SDN\nproviders, traffic and content-exchange networks all over the world: (IX)\nEquinix, DE-CIX, London-IX and AMS-IX.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

With these points of presence, Linxdatacenter can organize the\nconnection to global providers and services in only one or two days.\n\nAs the owner of traffic exchange points at its own sites, Linxdatacenter helps\ncarriers lower-traffic latency. Connection to IX Linxdatacenter enables\ncompanies \u2013 with services deployed on such platforms as Amazon, Google and\nAzure \u2013 to build dedicated circuits to global cloud providers and further\nreduce the time to access their resources.\n\nThanks to Linxdatacenter connectivity with global providers, companies can set\nup virtual workplaces with maximum security on any platform they choose:\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Nutanix Xi Cloud,\nOracle Cloud, and others.\n\nLinx Remote Toolkit supports employees working off-site and staff hired\ntemporarily, as it allows the prompt launch of the whole complex of necessary\nsoftware: office and conference applications, a full set of security tools,\nand a secure VPN connection.\n\nThe remote-desktop service consists of terminal servers with RDP connection\nbased on the Linxdatacenter cloud, virtual workstations on Amazon WorkSpaces,\nand Microsoft Office 365 services in the cloud. It includes tools for\ncorporate data protection: secure VPN connection, information security tools,\nuser-device scanning, and multifactor authentication.  \n\nThe risk of infrastructure and data loss is particularly high in situations\nthat involve large-scale remote work. Linxdatacenter bases its backup tools on\nVeeam Software. Backup, recovery and replication \u2013 managed through a\nfunctional console \u2013 ensure reliable access to data and applications. Using\nLinxdatacenter cloud, companies can avoid the necessity of supporting their\nown external infrastructure for backup.\n\n\u201cBusinesses urgently need solutions for increasing IT capacity and circuit\nbandwidth. The load on circuits will continue to grow during the pandemic and\nafterwards. To take just one example, companies that traditionally operated\noffline are now going online with videoconferences. Whoever thought that\nsports studios would have to start digital training to stay in business?\n\n\u201cI am sure that our Remote Toolkit will help many companies ride out this\nstorm, and even transform their businesses for the future,\u201d says Olga\nSokolova, General Director, Linxdatacenter.\n\n* * *\n\n**About _Linxdatacenter_**\n\n_Linxdatacenter, with headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is a global\nprovider of high-quality colocation, cloud and connectivity solutions for\nbusiness.

up, according to an internal investigation made by the cloud firm.**\n\nThe outage occurred on Thursday 26th March 2020, and resulted in the shutdown\nof Google\u2019s cloud services in several regions, including Dataflow, [Big Query,\nDialogFlow, Kubernetes Engine](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-unveils-\ndecade-end-digital-transformation-triumphs-at-next-19/), Cloud Firestore, App\nEngine and Cloud Console.\n\nAt 16:14 US/Pacific time, Cloud IAM experienced elevated error rates, which\ncaused disruption across many services for a duration of 3.5 hours, and stale\ndata (resulting in continued disruption in administrative operations for a\nsubset of services) for a duration of 14 hours.\n\nThe company revealed that what triggered the incident was a bulk update of\ngroup memberships that expanded to an unexpectedly high number of modified\npermissions, which generated a large backlog of queued mutations to be applied\nin real-time.\n\nThe processing of the backlog was degraded by a latent issue with the cache\nservers, which led to them running out of memory; this, in turn, resulted in\nrequests to IAM timing out.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is

in various regions by emergency\nrollouts performed to mitigate the high memory usage, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\u201cGoogle's commitment to user privacy and data security means that IAM is a\ncommon dependency across many GCP services,\u201d said the company on its\n[website](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20003#20003014).\n\n\u201cTo our Cloud customers, whose business was impacted during this disruption,\nwe sincerely apologise \u2013 this is not the level of quality and reliability we\nstrive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the\nplatform\u2019s performance and availability.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve\nthe resiliency of our service.\u201d\n\n**Read the latest from

Japan, according to data\nfrom Synergy Research Group.**\n\nNew data revealed that the leading six public cloud providers in China are all\nlocal companies, while [Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n](https://data-economy.com/amazon-and-microsoft-could-now-share-10bn-jedi-\ncloud-contract/)continue to lead in the rest of the APAC region.\n\nThe new Q4 data revealed that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is the leading provider in\nChina and also the second-ranked provider in the total region, helped by its\ngrowing presence in multiple other APAC countries.\n\nTencent (HKG: 0700) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) are the second and third-ranked\ncompanies in China and are also in the ranking of leading regional providers,\naccording to the data.\n\nIn Japan, Fujitsu, NTT and Softbank are all in the top six, though it is\nAmazon and Microsoft who lead the ranking.\n\nExcluding China and Japan, in the rest of the APAC region Amazon, Microsoft\nand Google are the leading public cloud providers, followed by Alibaba, IBM\nand South Korean firm Naver.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Beyond China every major country market is led by Amazon and\nMicrosoft,\u201d said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at\nSynergy Research Group.\n\n\u201cJapan has a long list of powerful technology vendors and IT service\nproviders, but even there it is Amazon and Microsoft who lead the market.\n\n\u201cPutting China to one side, this speaks to the truly global nature of the\ncloud market. To become one of the leaders requires global presence,\ntechnology smarts, a brand name that plays well in all countries, extremely\ndeep pockets, a long-term focus and total commitment from senior management.\u201d\n\nThe report added that public IaaS and PaaS are the most prominent segments of\nthe cloud infrastructure services market and account for the bulk of the\nrevenues, with the balance coming from managed or hosted private cloud\nservices.\n\nWithin the APAC region, [China accounts for almost a third of the public cloud\nmarket](https://data-economy.com/chinese-cloud-firms-now-account-for-40-the-\nof-apac-cloud-market/) and is more than twice the size of Japan, which is the\nsecond-largest country market.\n\nThe next biggest country markets in the region are India, South Korea,\nAustralia, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/cloud/)\n  * [APAC](https://data-economy.com/tag/apac/)\n  * [china](https://data-economy.com/tag/china/)\n  * [Synergy Research Group](https://data-economy.com/tag/synergy-research-group/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&text=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&mini=true&title=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Flocal-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n# More News\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-\nremote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/work-200x120.png?x13542)\n\n# [Google Cloud suffers 14-hour outage caused by 'large backlog of queued\nmutations'](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-suffers-14-hour-outage-\ncaused-by-large-backlog-of-queued-mutations/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/taipei-1851948_1920-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Colt Technology Services to provide hosting capability to Taiwan's three\nexchanges](https://data-economy.com/colt-technology-services-to-provide-\nhosting-capability-to-taiwans-three-exchanges/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

It\nwill also incorporate the internal IT team who are targeting the migration of\naround 10% of KPMG\u2019s internal workloads to Google Cloud during the course of\nthe year.\n\nGavin Booth, KPMG Google Cloud Business Alliance UK lead, said: \u201cThis\nstrategic partnership will support clients, in all sectors, with ambitions to\naccelerate their business transformation through investment in customer\nexperience, advanced analytics, regulatory compliance and IT transformation.\n\n\u201cThe combination of Google\u2019s technology platform and KPMG\u2019s business\nimplementation approach, deep functional experience and scale of certified\nstaff, will propel the delivery of digital solutions to a first-class\nquality.\u201d\n\nAs part of the alliance, a further two new and exclusive industry solutions\nbuilt on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are now in development, covering\nartificial intelligence for lenders and an AI-driven conversational chatbot\nbuilt for financial services clients to improve service levels and policy\ncompliance by internal staff.\n\nBruno Heese, European MD for ecosystem development and channels at Google\nCloud, said: \u201cKPMG\u2019s expertise in business transformation and management,\npaired with Google Cloud\u2019s cloud infrastructure and capabilities in areas like\nAI, ML and analytics will be a great benefit for UK customers, as they\ncontinue to migrate workloads to the cloud and take advantage of new cloud-\nbased solutions.\u201d\n\n  * More On:\n  * [KPMG](https://data-economy.com/tag/kpmg/)\n  *

 * __Other\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-things-\njune.jpg?x13542)\n\n* * *\n\n**Here are the five things you need to know this morning, April 07, 2020, from\naround the world directly to you.**\n\n* * *\n\n**AWS announces general availability of Amazon Detective**\n\nAmazon Web Services has announced the general availability of Amazon\nDetective, its new security service that makes it easy for customers to\nconduct investigations into security issues across their AWS workloads.\n\nAmazon Detective automatically collects log data from a customer\u2019s resources\nand uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build\ninteractive visualizations.\n\n\u201cEven when customers tell us their security teams have the tools and\ninformation to confidently detect and remediate issues, they often say they\nneed help when it comes to understanding what caused the issues in the first\nplace,\u201d said Dan Plastina, Vice President for Security Services at AWS.\n\n\u201cGathering the information necessary to conduct effective security\ninvestigations has traditionally been a burdensome process, which can put\ncrucial in-depth analysis out of reach for smaller organisations and strain\nresources for larger teams.\n\n\u201cAmazon Detective takes all of that extra work off of the customer\u2019s plate,\nallowing them to focus on finding the root cause of an issue and ensuring it\ndoesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**Canonical announces Managed Apps for enterprise cloud operations**\n\nCanonical has announced a Managed Apps service that enables enterprises to\nhave their apps deployed and operated by Canonical as a fully managed service.\n\nThe company said it will cover ten widely used cloud-native database and LMA\n(logging, monitoring and alerting) apps on multi-cloud Kubernetes but also on\nvirtual machines across bare-metal, public and private cloud.\n\n\u201cAs organisations increasingly move to a cloud-native approach, they can be\nslowed down by spending too much time on the underlying management of their\ncloud and its applications,\u201d said Stephan Fabel, Director

Today, [it introduced a\nfree tier](https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-made-serverless-with-confluent-\ncloud) to that cloud service. The company hopes to expand its market beyond\nlarge technology company customers, and the free tier should make it easier\nfor smaller companies to get started.\n\nThe new tier provides up to $50 of service a month for up to three months.\nCompany CEO Jay Kreps says that while $50 might not sound like much, it's\nactually hundreds of gigabytes of throughput and makes it easy to get started\nwith the tool.\n\n\"We felt like we can make this technology really accessible. We can make it as\neasy as we can. We want to make it something where you can just get going in\nseconds, and not have to pay anything to start building an application that\nuses real-time streams of data,\" Kreps said.\n\nKafka has been available as an open-source product since 2011, so it's been\nfree to download, install and build applications, but still required a ton of\ncompute and engineering resources to pull off. The cloud service was designed\nto simplify that, and the free tier lets developers get comfortable building a\nsmall application without making a large financial investment.\n\nOnce they get used to working with Kafka on the free version, users can then\nbuy in whatever increments make sense for them, and only pay for what they\nuse. It can be pennies' worth of Kafka or hundreds of dollars, depending on a\ncustomer's individual requirements. \"After free, you can buy 11 cents' worth\nof Kafka or you can buy it $10 worth, all the way up to these massive users\nlike Lyft that use [Confluent ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/confluent)\nCloud at huge scale as part of their ridesharing service,\" he said.\n\nWhile a free SaaS trial might feel like a common kind of marketing approach,\nKreps says for a service like Kafka, it's actually much more difficult to pull\noff. \"With something like a distributed system where you get a whole chunk of\ninfrastructure, it's actually technically an extraordinarily difficult thing\nto provide zero to elastic scale up capabilities. And a huge amount of\nengineering goes into making that possible,\" Kreps explained.\n\nKafka processes massive streams of data in real time. It was originally\ndeveloped inside LinkedIn and open-sourced in 2011. Confluent launched as a\ncommercial entity on top of the open-source project in 2014. In January the\ncompany raised [$125 million on a $2.5 billion\nvaluation](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/open-source-leader-confluent-\nraises-125m-on-2-5b-valuation/).

Lufthansa will combine previously disparate\nsystems and data feeds into one unified platform by leveraging Google Cloud\u2019s\ninfrastructure and machine-learning capabilities.\n\nLufthansa Group is the world\u2019s largest aviation group in terms of revenue. In\n2018, it generated sales of around \u20ac35.8bn billion. In 2019, it had 145m\npassengers and employed over 135,000.\n\nThe new operations platform will simultaneously consider a number of factors\nof a stable operation - aircraft rotation, aircraft maintenance, crew\nassignment and more - and provide recommendations to improve passenger\npunctuality, on-time flights and flight plan adherence in case of disruptions,\nsuch as weather events or delays due to airspace congestion.\n\nTo support Lufthansa in designing and implementing the platform, an onsite\nGoogle Cloud team will work hand-in-hand with operations and IT experts from\nLufthansa.\n\n\u201cBy combining Google Cloud's technology with Lufthansa Group\u2019s operational\nexpertise, we are driving the digitisation of our operation even further,\"\nsaid Detlef Kayser, a member of the executive board of Lufthansa Group. \"This\nwill enable us to identify possible flight irregularities even earlier and\nimplement counter-measures at an early stage.\"\n\n\u201cThrough this collaboration, we have a significant opportunity to\nrevolutionise the future of airline operations,\u201d said Thomas Kurian, CEO for\nGoogle Cloud. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the best of Lufthansa Group and Google Cloud\ntogether to solve airline's biggest challenges and positively impact the\ntravel experience of the more than 145m passengers that fly annually with\nthem.\u201d\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Lufthansa](https://data-economy.com/tag/lufthansa/)\n  * [Google Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/google-cloud/)\n  *

beyond\n\n* * *\n\n**Global health crisis accelerates need, company responds.**\n\n[Linxdatacenter](https://www.linxdatacenter.com/), an international provider\nof data storage, cloud and telecom solutions, has created an IT toolkit that\nenables businesses to continue effective operations under quarantine \u2013 and\nafterward.\n\nEarlier, Linxdatacenter announced free-of-charge access to cloud services for\ncompanies whose business was suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes.

up, according to an internal investigation made by the cloud firm.**\n\nThe outage occurred on Thursday 26th March 2020, and resulted in the shutdown\nof Google\u2019s cloud services in several regions, including Dataflow, [Big Query,\nDialogFlow, Kubernetes Engine](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-unveils-\ndecade-end-digital-transformation-triumphs-at-next-19/), Cloud Firestore, App\nEngine and Cloud Console.\n\nAt 16:14 US/Pacific time, Cloud IAM experienced elevated error rates, which\ncaused disruption across many services for a duration of 3.5 hours, and stale\ndata (resulting in continued disruption in administrative operations for a\nsubset of services) for a duration of 14 hours.\n\nThe company revealed that what triggered the incident was a bulk update of\ngroup memberships that expanded to an unexpectedly high number of modified\npermissions, which generated a large backlog of queued mutations to be applied\nin real-time.\n\nThe processing of the backlog was degraded by a latent issue with the cache\nservers, which led to them running out of memory; this, in turn, resulted in\nrequests to IAM timing out.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is

in various regions by emergency\nrollouts performed to mitigate the high memory usage, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\u201cGoogle's commitment to user privacy and data security means that IAM is a\ncommon dependency across many GCP services,\u201d said the company on its\n[website](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20003#20003014).\n\n\u201cTo our Cloud customers, whose business

Japan, according to data\nfrom Synergy Research Group.**\n\nNew data revealed that the leading six public cloud providers in China are all\nlocal companies, while [Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n](https://data-economy.com/amazon-and-microsoft-could-now-share-10bn-jedi-\ncloud-contract/)continue to lead in the rest of the APAC region.\n\nThe new Q4 data revealed that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is the leading provider in\nChina and also the second-ranked provider in the total region, helped by its\ngrowing presence in multiple other APAC countries.\n\nTencent (HKG: 0700) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) are the second and third-ranked\ncompanies in China and are also in the ranking of leading regional providers,\naccording to the data.\n\nIn Japan, Fujitsu, NTT and Softbank are all in the top six, though it is\nAmazon and Microsoft who lead the ranking.\n\nExcluding China and Japan, in the rest of the APAC region Amazon, Microsoft\nand Google are the leading public cloud providers, followed by Alibaba, IBM\nand South Korean firm Naver.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Beyond China every major country market is led by Amazon and\nMicrosoft,\u201d said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at\nSynergy Research Group.\n\n\u201cJapan has a long list of powerful technology vendors and IT service\nproviders, but even there it is Amazon and Microsoft who lead the market.\n\n\u201cPutting China to one side, this speaks to the truly global nature of the\ncloud market. To become one of the leaders requires global presence,\ntechnology smarts, a brand name that plays well in all countries, extremely\ndeep pockets, a long-term focus and total commitment from senior management.\u201d\n\nThe report added that public IaaS and PaaS are the most prominent segments of\nthe cloud infrastructure services market and account for the bulk of the\nrevenues, with the balance coming from managed or hosted private cloud\nservices.\n\nWithin the APAC region, [China accounts for almost a third of the public cloud\nmarket](https://data-economy.com/chinese-cloud-firms-now-account-for-40-the-\nof-apac-cloud-market/) and is more than twice the size of Japan, which is the\nsecond-largest country market.\n\nThe next biggest country markets in the region are India, South Korea,\nAustralia, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/cloud/)\n  * [APAC](https://data-economy.com/tag/apac/)\n  * [china](https://data-economy.com/tag/china/)\n  * [Synergy Research Group](https://data-economy.com/tag/synergy-research-group/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&text=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&mini=true&title=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Flocal-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n# More News\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-\nremote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/work-200x120.png?x13542)\n\n# [Google Cloud suffers 14-hour outage caused by 'large backlog of queued\nmutations'](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-suffers-14-hour-outage-\ncaused-by-large-backlog-of-queued-mutations/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/taipei-1851948_1920-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Colt Technology Services to provide hosting capability to Taiwan's three\nexchanges](https://data-economy.com/colt-technology-services-to-provide-\nhosting-capability-to-taiwans-three-exchanges/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

Each of these numbers tells a story, but in the cloud market,\nwhere aggregate growth remains high and Azure's healthy expansions continues,\nit's still struggling to gain meaningful ground on AWS\u2019s lead.\n\nThis has to be frustrating to [Microsoft\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft) CEO Satya Nadella, who has\nmanaged to take his company from cloud wannabe to a strong second place in\nthe[ IaaS/PaaS market](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/wtf-is-cloud-\ncomputing/), yet still finds his company miles behind the cloud leader. He's\ndone everything right to get his company to this point, but sometimes the math\njust isn't in your favor.\n\n## Numbers don't lie\n\nJohn Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, says Microsoft\u2019s growth rate\nis higher overall than [Amazon's,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon) but AWS still has a big lead in\nmarket share. \"In absolute dollar terms, it usually has larger increments in\nrevenue numbers and that makes Amazon hard to catch,\" he says, adding \"what I\ncan say is that this is a very tough gap to close and mathematically it could\nnot happen any time soon, whatever the quarterly performance of Microsoft and\n[AWS ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws).\"\n\nThe thing to remember with the cloud market is that it's not even close to\nbeing a fixed pie. In fact, it's growing rapidly and there's still plenty of\nmarket share left to win. As of today, before Amazon has reported, it has a\nsubstantial lead, no matter how you choose to measure it.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Microsoft and NTT strike digital transformation go-to-market cloud alliance -

Until proved otherwise,\nthe virus called SARS-COV-2 was made by scientists and escaped in a\nlaboratory. It is a laboratory construct and a manipulated virus. It is not\nthe product of natural evolution. The sudden and forceful spread of the virus,\nespecially from China to Europe and then to America makes my assertion to be\nnear correct. You can label my conclusion as a conspiracy theory but the fact\nthat the virus did not originate in Africa with its poor environment and poor\nsanitation but imported into the continent tend to vindicate my position. The\nquestion we should ask is when and where was this virus created.**\n\nI want to suggest that the country that is profiting more from this pandemic\nvirus crisis must know about its creation. We all know that China, Israel,\nGreat Britain, Russia, France, United States of America, Canada and some key\ncountries are involved in espionage wars\u2014they call it space craft revolution\nwhile that of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United\nStates of America is called FIVE EYES (FVEY). But that of United States of\nAmerica and China espionage war, currently raging, is the most deadly. The\nobjective is to gain superior power and control both in commerce, science,\ntechnology but most especially in commerce. The full details about the major\ncause of the Coronavirus may not be known until after the US presidential\nelection in November. I pray and hope that things will not get out of hand\nbefore then. The present global picture is grim.\n\nThe free air has been contaminated. Faulty radiation is circulating\neverywhere. There is sadness and tears in many homes globally. The worry is\nthat no one knows how and when it will end. The religious leaders in their\ncomfort, may give their own interpretation over the virus. They are free to do\nso. The virus has highlighted the different roles played by science and\nreligion in the affairs of mankind. No doubt science has improved the world.\nThrough science we can live much longer and better. We can even live more\ncomfortable and longer. We can fly from London to Lagos in six hours. We can\nwatch live events on television and see what is happening in all parts of the\nworld. We can perform surgery without any pain. We can perform wonders which\nwe never dreamt of before. Man invented penicillin, electricity, the wheel,\nnail, compass, internal combustions, computers, telephones, the printing\npress, contraceptives, transistors, the internet, electronics, optical lenses,\ngun powder, engines, cars, airplanes, rockets, nuclear fission, plastics,\ncolour mauve and others. But alas! Science cannot now rescue us, for even the\nscientist is lost in the terrible midnight of our age. Indeed, science gave us\nthe very instruments that threatens to bring universal suicide. So modern man\nface a dreary and frightening midnight in the social order. \u201cFor every action\nthere is an equal and opposite reaction\u201d Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727)  \nIn the past we used to think that with science, man can be as big as he wants.  \nWilliam Shakespeare wrote in his book \u201cHAMLET\u201d, \u201cWhat a piece of work is man!\nHow noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form, in moving, how\nexpress and admirable in action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a\ngold! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!\u201d\n\nThrough Usain Bolt of Jamaica, man can run a hundred meters in 9.58seconds. In\nthe literary world, if Michelangelo (1475-1564) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)\ncould paint so beautifully and Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770-1827) could compose\nso excellently and William Shakespeare (1564-1616), Professor Akinwande\nOluwole Babatunde Soyinka (85) and Albert Chinualumogo Achebe (1930-2013) and\nothers could write beautiful poems there is hardly any height that man can not\nachieve.\n\nMan can think a poem and write it; he can think a symphony and compose it; he\ncan think of a great civilization and produce it. Because of this capacity, he\nis not bound completely by space and time. He may be a John Bunyan, held\nwithin spatial boundaries of Bedford Jail, whose mind transcends the bars and\nproduces The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress. He may be a Handel, moving into the evening\nof life, his physical vision almost gone, raising his mental vision to the\nhighest heavens and transcribing the glad thunders and gentle sighings of the\ngreat Messiah. By his ability to reason, his power of memory, and his gift of\nimagination, man transcends time and space. As marvelous as are the stars in\nthe mind of man that studies them. Man is not the only creature of God, but\nout of greed it has almost wiped out the other species of mankind.  \nThe CoronaVirus has raised the difference between religion and science. The\ncivil rights leader in America, Dr Martin Luther King,Jnr. (1929-1968) tried\nhard in explaining the role of science and religion. In his essay titled \u201cA\nTOUGH MIND AND A TENDER HEART\u201d which he wrote in 1958, he declared, \u201cThere may\nbe a conflict between softminded religionists and toughminded scientists, but\nnot between science and religion. Their respective worlds are different and\ntheir methods are dissimilar. Science investigates, religion interprets.\nScience gives man knowledge, which is power, religion gives man wisdom which\nis control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with\nvalues. The two are not rivals. They are complementary. Science keeps religion\nfrom sinking into the valley of crippling irrationalism and paralyzing\nobscurantism. Religion prevents science from falling into the marsh of\nobsolete materialism and moral nihilism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who posit the materialistic conception of man are often driven to the\ndark chambers of pessimism. They often find themselves agreeing with a recent\nwriter that \u201cman is an osmic accident, a disease on this planet not soon to be\ncured,\u201d or with Jonathan Swift, who wrote, \u201cMan is the most pernicious little\nrace of ominous vermin that nature ever suffered to walk across the face of\nthe earth\u201d.\n\nWith the arrival of Coronavirus and its radioactive fallout, it is now clear\nthat we are now living on borrowed time. And that mankind had invented the\nscience that will wipe us out. It is now clear that all our achievements and\nsuccesses are nothing but vanity. A few hours before he was assassinated on\nApril 3, 1968 in Melphis, Dr. Martin Luther King,Jnr. Declared \u201cWe have got\nsome difficult days ahead, something is happening in our world. Trouble is in\nthe land, confusion all around us. I don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d I hope we\nare not facing the same dilemma now.  \nIn this part of the world, this is the second time we are witnessing a flu of\nsuch magnitude as a nation. In 1960, I was in the final year at Otapete\nMethodist Primary School in Ilesha, along with Bolanle Jegede, Siyan Malomo,\nBola Olojo, Olu Malomo, Deboye Olatunbosun, Niyi Komolafe, Kola Dudubo, Dele\nFayehun, Funlayo Gureje, Keji Ojo, Apeke David, Debisi Fatunwase, Mosun\nAwofeso, Ramoni Okulaja, Alao Tiamiyu, Aina Kupoluyi, Opebiyi girls and others\nwhen our teacher and my guardian, Mr. Fatunwase lectured us on the flu at that\ntime. The flu was as a result of the radioactive fallout of an atomic bomb\ntested by France. At that time we suddenly noticed that our eyes were red and\nconstantly coughing. This was more pronounced in the northern region at that\ntime. I do not know the exact number of people that died during the flu but\nthere were leaflets circulated by government at that time of the dangers of\nthe flu. At that time there was no data to know the victims. This was sixty-\nyears ago. As a matter of fact when I settled in brigade area in Kano in 1969,\nthat is nine years after the event, people were still talking about the 1960\nflu.\n\nFrance is one of the five \"Nuclear Weapons States\" under the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but is not known to possess or develop\nany chemical or biological weapons. France was the fourth country to test an\nindependently developed nuclear weapon in 1960, under the government of\nCharles de Gaulle.\n\nOn 13 February 1960, France conducted its first nuclear test, code-named\n\u201cGerboise Bleue\u201d (Blue Desert Rat). The day marked the beginning of a series\nof four atmospheric nuclear tests at the Reganne Oasis, in the Sahara Desert\nof Algeria. With an explosive yield of 70 kilotons, Gerboise Bleue was\nrelatively large for a country\u2019s first nuclear test, around four times as\npowerful as the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nMilitary scientists triggered off the \"device\" at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. EST) atop a\n330-foot tower just south of the oasis of Reggane in the heart of the desolate\narea known as \"the region of total thirst.\"\n\nPresident Charles de Gaulle himself announced the successful explosion in a\ncommunique issued from his Elysee Palace in Paris 30 minutes later. He hailed\nthe historic event as a significant contribution to the defense potential of\nnot only France but to the Western world as well.\n\nThat angered many who point to what they see as an ongoing disaster in\nAlgeria. \u201cThis area is still one of the most affected,\u201d said Roland Desbordes,\npresident of the Commission for Independent Research and Information about\nRadiation, who has visited the blast sites with Algerian journalists and\nnuclear experts multiple times. \u201cIt\u2019s frequented by desert nomads. There\u2019s a\nwell that they use near Tan Afella Mountain,\u201d a peak that rises directly above\nthe underground testing site.\n\nWhen France finally left, it buried a range of contaminated objects throughout\nthe two areas \u2014 metal from remote-controlled towers that activated the bombs,\nengine parts from planes that flew into Gerboise Bleue\u2019s mushroom cloud to\ngather radiation data and military-grade trucks placed in the blast radius to\nact as barometers of its power. But Saharan winds later swept away the sand\ncovering these nuclear tombs.\n\nSouthern Algerians \u2014 the vast majority of whom were never informed by the\nFrench about residual radiation hazards and in some cases the testing dates \u2014\nbegan stripping the items for resources.\n\n\u201cThe fact that people were not aware of the dangers of this material for years\nis criminal,\u201d said Larbi Benchiha, a French-Algerian journalist who was born\nin Algeria a year before Gerboise Bleue and has made two documentaries on\nReggane and the surrounding areas. Benchiha did not learn about the nuclear\ntests until 1996 \u2014 16 years after he moved to France.\n\n\u201cFrom the abandoned nuclear testing bases, people have recovered plates,\nbeams, electrical cables and equipment of all kinds, all of which is\nradioactive,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey have incorporated them into the construction\nof their homes.\u201d\n\nResidents of Reggane told Benchiha about the strange uptick of medical issues\nthat first appeared during the 1970s and continue to this day. Babies born\nwith atrophied limbs; cancers of the liver, stomach and skin; cases of\ntemporary blindness among those who saw the brutal flash of light as it ripped\nthrough the Maghreb about 6:30 a.m. Some of Reggane\u2019s faithful were in the\nmiddle of their Islamic morning prayers when it happened 55 years ago.  \nAhmed el-Hadj Hamadi was huddled into a building with the rest of his\ncommunity by French soldiers early in the morning. They were instructed to lie\ndown, close their eyes and cover their ears. He then remembers a sound like\n\u201cthe world coming to an end\u201d and the windows turning white. A cord above their\nprone bodies swung erratically until the light bulb it held shattered.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the apocalypse. We all did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all thought we\nmight die.\u201d Later, the French military began tasking out labor to residents in\nthe isolated desert region of Algeria. \u201cThey had built a kind of village at\nthe explosion area, and even put animals in it,\u201d Hamadi added. \u201cAfter the\nblast we were sent out to gather all the rubbish. The ground was all burned,\nwhite, liquid.\u201d\n\nTo nomadic communities around the town of Reggane, they\u2019re known more than\nhalf a century later as \u201cleopard skins\u201d \u2014 stretches of sand across Algeria\u2019s\nsouthern Sahara that are peppered with small black clumps. People used to\ncollect scrap metal from the charred warplanes and trucks that emerge, fossil-\nlike, and then smelt them into jewelry and kitchen utensils.\n\nBut these Algerians were not properly warned of their danger after France\u2019s\nmisgoverned nuclear bomb-testing campaign of the early 1960s, which vitrified\nvast tracts of desert with heat and plutonium and left a legacy of uncontained\nradiation that is still crippling inhabitants. Estimates of the number of\nAlgerians affected by testing range from 27,000 \u2014 cited by the French Ministry\nof Defense \u2014 to 60,000, the figure given by Abdul Kadhim al-Aboudi, an\nAlgerian professor of nuclear physics.\n\nFor many who lived in Reggane the week before Feb. 13, 1960, the only record\nof their radiation was captured by a necklace. When French troops visited\npopulations the day before Gerboise Bleue, they issued dosimeters on chains to\nbe worn around the neck. A few days later, the troops returned. They collected\nthe necklaces, wrote down who wore them and left, keeping the data for their\nanalyses but never returning to let residents know of the invisible danger\nthat would soon afflict them.\n\nHamadi, who has lived within 50 miles of France\u2019s aboveground blast sites\nsince before the tests, told Al Jazeera he was completely unaware of any\nFrench compensation plan.  \n\u201cThe French are our brothers \u2026 But we just want the protection we need,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe need proper communication, medical evaluations, protections and\npayment for the damages. No one has helped us.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of the Gerboise test series, France switched to underground\ntesting at another site in the Algerian Sahara, named In Ecker, where it\nconducted a further 13 nuclear tests until 1967. Subsequent French nuclear\ntesting was conducted at French Polynesian atolls in the South Pacific, site\nof atmospheric thermonuclear tests, starting with the 2.6 megaton Canopus test\nin August 1968. I was wearing shorts. We were made to lie face down on the\nground, eyes closed and arms folded, and not watch the flash, but immediately\nafterwards we had to get up with an apparatus round our necks and measure and\nphotograph the impact. The French government had always maintained that its\nnuclear operations were carried out as safely as possible. Yet a confidential\nmilitary report, first obtained by the French newspaper Le Parisien in 2010,\nindicated that soldiers had been used as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d to study the effects of\nradiation on human health.\n\nAccording to the report, a 1961 nuclear test involved military personnel\nadvancing on foot and in trucks to within a few hundred metres of the\nepicentre of a nuclear blast less than an hour after detonation. A 2008 survey\nconducted by the French nuclear test veterans' association Aven showed that 35\npercent of the polled veterans had one or more types of cancer and one in five\nhad become infertile. According to Algerian scientist Kathum El-Abodi, nuclear\ntesting in Algeria also resulted in environmental degradation, such as the\nmovement of sand dunes in areas already affected by wind erosion. Radiation\nfurthermore led to a decline in livestock and biodiversity, including the\ndisappearance of a number of migratory and endemic reptiles and birds, says\nEl-Abodi. France conducted the last of its 210 nuclear tests on 27 January\n1996 in French Polynesia. Especially the final French testing series \u2013 carried\nout during the negotiations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) in Geneva \u2013 provoked international protests, including boycotts of\nFrench products. Later that year, France was one of the first countries to\nsign the CTBT, subsequently ratifying it on 6 April 1998. France also closed\nand dismantled all its test sites - the only Nuclear Weapon State to date that\nhas done so. In 2009, the French Senate passed a bill acknowledging the impact\nof its nuclear testing programme and providing a first compensation scheme for\ncivilian and military veterans.\n\nAfter the independence of Algeria on 5 July 1962, following the 19 March 1962\nEvian agreements, the French military moved the test site to another location\nin the Algerian Sahara, around 150 km north of Tamnarasset, near the village\nof In Eker. Underground nuclear explosion testing was performed in drifts in\nthe Taourirt Tan Afella mountain, one of the granite Hoggar Mountains. The\nEvian agreements included a secret article which stated that \"Algeria\nconcede[s]\u2026 to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and\nmilitary installations which are necessary to it [France]\" during five years.\nThe C.S.E.M. was therefore replaced by the Centre d'Exp\u00e9rimentations\nMilitaires des Oasis (\"Military Experiments Center of the Oasis\") underground\nnuclear testing facility. A total of 13 underground nuclear tests were carried\nout at the In Eker site from 7 November 1961 to 16 February 1966. By July 1,\n1967, all French facilities were evacuated. An accident happened on May 1,\n1962, during the \"B\u00e9ryl\" test, four times more powerful than Hiroshima and\ndesigned as an underground shaft test. Due to improper sealing of the shaft,\nradioactive rock and dust were released into the atmosphere. Nine soldiers of\nthe 621st Groupe d'Armes Sp\u00e9ciales unit were heavily contaminated by\nradiation.The soldiers were exposed to as much as 600 mSv. The Minister of\nArmed Forces, Pierre Messmer, and the Minister of Research, Gaston Palewski,\nwere present. As many as 100 additional personnel, including officials,\nsoldiers and Algerian workers were exposed to lower levels of radiation,\nestimated at about 50 mSv, when the radioactive cloud produced by the blast\npassed over the command post, due to an unexpected change in wind direction.\nThey escaped as they could, often without wearing any protection. Palewski\ndied in 1984 of leukemia, which he always attributed to the B\u00e9ryl incident. In\n2006, Bruno Barillot, specialist of nuclear tests, measured 93 microsieverts\nby hour of gamma ray at the site, equivalent to 1% of the official admissible\nyearly dose.The incident was documented in the 2006 docudrama \"Vive La Bombe!\n\nThe test provoked swift condemnation from Japan, which has also protested in\nthe past against tests carried out by the United States, Britain and the USSR.\nAll three nations agreed two years ago to cease test explosions but France\nwould not be bound by such an agreement\u2026Today, Moscow joined Japan in\ncondemning the test saying it was a serious blow to any hope of disarmament\nand against the wishes of the United Nations. Moscow Radio described the act\nas \"a monstrous challenge to world public opinion\"\u2026.Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria\nand Ghana have also expressed outrage at France's action and its timing - on\nthe eve of the African summit in Casablanca. In Cairo, the deputy secretary\ngeneral of the Arab League, El Dardiri Ismail, called for all Arab nations to\nbreak off political and economic links with France\u2026.Today's bomb contained\nplutonium and had an explosive force equal to 10,000 to 14,000 tons of TNT -\nhalf as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. It was exploded at the top of a steel\ntower. Military equipment, dummies and caged rats and mice were positioned in\nthe area of the blast were monitored during and after the explosion.  \nIt was this action by France that forced the government of Alhaji Abubakar\nTafawa Balewa to break diplomatic relations with France in 1961. As a\nretaliation, France recognized Biafra during the civil war. If the fallout\nfrom France testing their atomic bomb in Algeria in 1960 could lead to the\ndeath of many people, let us imagine, what Great Britain, France, China, North\nKorea, Israel, India, Pakistan, Japan and other world powers that have atomic\nbombs have developed since 1960. Gradually it is becoming clear that mankind\nhas invented weapons of destruction. The same science that made our lives\nlonger and better is the same science that will delete our lives eventually.\nMan is gradually becoming a victim of his own inventions.\n\n### RECEIVE ALERTS FROM THECABLE\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/whatsappicon.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\nWHATSAPP [08113975334](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\nTWITTER [@thecableng](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\n_Copyright 2020 TheCable.

For\ninstance, they could take advantage of Einstein, Salesforce's artificial\nintelligence platform, to add elements like next-best actions to the site, the\nkind of intelligent functionality that would typically be out of reach of most\ndevelopers.\n\nDevelopers also often need to connect to other enterprise systems from their\ne-commerce site to share data with these tools. To fill that need, Salesforce\nis taking advantage of [MuleSoft,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/mulesoft) the company it purchased\nalmost two years ago [for $6.5\nbillion](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-\nenterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/). Using MuleSoft's integration technology,\nSalesforce can help connect to other systems like ERP financial systems or\nproduct management tools and exchange information between the two systems.\n\nBrent Leary, founder at CRM Essentials, whose experience with Salesforce goes\nback to its earliest days, says this about helping give developers the tools\nthey need to create the same kind of integrated shopping experiences consumers\nhave grown to expect from Amazon.\n\n\"These tools give developers real-time insights delivered at the 'moment of\ntruth' to optimize conversion opportunities, and automate processes to improve\nordering and fulfillment efficiencies. This should give developers in the\nSalesforce ecosystem what they need to deliver Amazon-like experiences while\nhaving to compete with them,\" he said.\n\nTo help get customers comfortable with these tools, the company also announced\na new Commerce Cloud Development Center to access a community of developers\nwho can discuss and share solutions with one another, an SDK with code samples\nand Trailhead education resources.\n\nSalesforce made these announcement as part of the National Retail Foundation\n(NRF) Conference [taking place in New York City](https://nrfbigshow.nrf.com/)\nthis week.\n\n> [Revenue train kept rolling all year long for\n> Salesforce](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/27/revenue-train-kept-rolling-\n> all-year-long-for-salesforce/)\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Options launches all-flash cloud storage as-a-service with Pure -

world directly to you.**\n\n* * *\n\n**AWS announces general availability of Amazon Detective**\n\nAmazon Web Services has announced the general availability of Amazon\nDetective, its new security service that makes it easy for customers to\nconduct investigations into security issues across their AWS workloads.\n\nAmazon Detective automatically collects log data from a customer\u2019s resources\nand uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build\ninteractive visualizations.\n\n\u201cEven when customers tell us their security teams have the tools and\ninformation to confidently detect and remediate issues, they often say they\nneed help when it comes to understanding what caused the issues in the first\nplace,\u201d said Dan Plastina, Vice President for Security Services at AWS.\n\n\u201cGathering the information necessary to conduct effective security\ninvestigations has traditionally been a burdensome process, which can put\ncrucial in-depth analysis out of reach for smaller organisations and strain\nresources for larger teams.\n\n\u201cAmazon Detective takes all of that extra work off of the customer\u2019s plate,\nallowing them to focus on finding the root cause of an issue and ensuring it\ndoesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**Canonical announces Managed Apps for enterprise cloud operations**\n\nCanonical has announced a Managed Apps service that enables enterprises to\nhave their apps deployed and operated by Canonical as a fully managed service.\n\nThe company said it will cover ten widely used cloud-native database and LMA\n(logging, monitoring and alerting) apps on multi-cloud Kubernetes but also on\nvirtual machines across bare-metal, public and private cloud.\n\n\u201cAs organisations increasingly move to a cloud-native approach, they can be\nslowed down by spending too much time on the underlying management of their\ncloud and its applications,\u201d said Stephan Fabel, Director of Product at\nCanonical.\n\n\u201cOur Managed Apps give them the freedom to focus on business priorities, with\nthe confidence that their apps are reliably maintained, secure and can scale\nto production needs.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes.

With these points of presence, Linxdatacenter can organize the\nconnection to global providers and services in only one or two days.\n\nAs the owner of traffic exchange points at its own sites, Linxdatacenter helps\ncarriers lower-traffic latency. Connection to IX Linxdatacenter enables\ncompanies \u2013 with services deployed on such platforms as Amazon, Google and\nAzure \u2013 to build dedicated circuits to global cloud providers and further\nreduce the time to access their resources.\n\nThanks to Linxdatacenter connectivity with global providers, companies can set\nup virtual workplaces with maximum security on any platform they choose:\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Nutanix Xi Cloud,\nOracle Cloud, and others.\n\nLinx Remote Toolkit supports employees working off-site and staff hired\ntemporarily, as it allows the prompt launch of the whole complex of necessary\nsoftware: office and conference applications, a full set of security tools,\nand a secure VPN connection.\n\nThe remote-desktop service consists of terminal servers with RDP connection\nbased on the Linxdatacenter cloud, virtual workstations on Amazon WorkSpaces,\nand Microsoft Office 365 services in the cloud. It includes tools for\ncorporate data protection: secure VPN connection, information security tools,\nuser-device scanning, and multifactor authentication.  \n\nThe risk of infrastructure and data loss is particularly high in situations\nthat involve large-scale remote work. Linxdatacenter bases its backup tools on\nVeeam Software. Backup, recovery and replication \u2013 managed through a\nfunctional console \u2013 ensure reliable access to data and applications. Using\nLinxdatacenter cloud, companies can avoid the necessity of supporting their\nown external infrastructure for backup.\n\n\u201cBusinesses urgently need solutions for increasing IT capacity and circuit\nbandwidth. The load on circuits will continue to grow during the pandemic and\nafterwards. To take just one example, companies that traditionally operated\noffline are now going online with videoconferences.

up, according to an internal investigation made by the cloud firm.**\n\nThe outage occurred on Thursday 26th March 2020, and resulted in the shutdown\nof Google\u2019s cloud services in several regions, including Dataflow, [Big Query,\nDialogFlow, Kubernetes Engine](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-unveils-\ndecade-end-digital-transformation-triumphs-at-next-19/), Cloud Firestore, App\nEngine and Cloud Console.\n\nAt 16:14 US/Pacific time, Cloud IAM experienced elevated error rates, which\ncaused disruption across many services for a duration of 3.5 hours, and stale\ndata (resulting in continued disruption in administrative operations for a\nsubset of services) for a duration of 14 hours.\n\nThe company revealed that what triggered the incident was a bulk update of\ngroup memberships that expanded to an unexpectedly high number of modified\npermissions, which generated a large backlog of queued mutations to be applied\nin real-time.\n\nThe processing of the backlog was degraded by a latent issue with the cache\nservers, which led to them running out of memory; this, in turn, resulted in\nrequests to IAM timing out.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is

in various regions by emergency\nrollouts performed to mitigate the high memory usage, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\u201cGoogle's commitment to user privacy and data security means that IAM is a\ncommon dependency across many GCP services,\u201d said the company on its\n[website](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20003#20003014).\n\n\u201cTo our Cloud customers, whose business

the\nplatform\u2019s performance and availability.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve\nthe resiliency of our service.\u201d\n\n**Read the latest from

(NASDAQ: MSFT)\n](https://data-economy.com/amazon-and-microsoft-could-now-share-10bn-jedi-\ncloud-contract/)continue to lead in the rest of the APAC region.\n\nThe new Q4 data revealed that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is the leading provider in\nChina and also the second-ranked provider in the total region, helped by its\ngrowing presence in multiple other APAC countries.\n\nTencent (HKG: 0700) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) are the second and third-ranked\ncompanies in China and are also in the ranking of leading regional providers,\naccording to the data.\n\nIn Japan, Fujitsu, NTT and Softbank are all in the top six, though it is\nAmazon and Microsoft who lead the ranking.\n\nExcluding China and Japan, in the rest of the APAC region Amazon, Microsoft\nand Google are the leading public cloud

Beyond China every major country market is led by Amazon and\nMicrosoft,\u201d said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at\nSynergy Research Group.\n\n\u201cJapan has a long list of powerful technology vendors and IT service\nproviders, but even there it is Amazon and Microsoft who lead the market.\n\n\u201cPutting China to one side, this speaks to the truly global nature of the\ncloud market. To become one of the leaders requires global presence,\ntechnology smarts, a brand name that plays well in all countries, extremely\ndeep pockets, a long-term focus and total commitment from senior management.\u201d\n\nThe report added that public IaaS and PaaS are the most prominent segments of\nthe cloud infrastructure services market and account for the bulk of the\nrevenues, with the balance coming from managed or hosted private cloud\nservices.\n\nWithin the APAC region, [China accounts for almost a third of the public cloud\nmarket](https://data-economy.com/chinese-cloud-firms-now-account-for-40-the-\nof-apac-cloud-market/) and is more than twice the size of Japan, which is the\nsecond-largest country market.\n\nThe next biggest country markets in the region are India, South Korea,\nAustralia, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/cloud/)\n  * [APAC](https://data-economy.com/tag/apac/)\n  * [china](https://data-economy.com/tag/china/)\n  * [Synergy Research Group](https://data-economy.com/tag/synergy-research-group/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&text=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&mini=true&title=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Flocal-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n# More News\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-\nremote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/work-200x120.png?x13542)\n\n# [Google Cloud suffers 14-hour outage caused by 'large backlog of queued\nmutations'](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-suffers-14-hour-outage-\ncaused-by-large-backlog-of-queued-mutations/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/taipei-1851948_1920-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Colt Technology Services to provide hosting capability to Taiwan's three\nexchanges](https://data-economy.com/colt-technology-services-to-provide-\nhosting-capability-to-taiwans-three-exchanges/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

It wants to take on the world's biggest\ncloud vendors by offering developers a cheaper alternative that also removes a\nlot of the complexity around managing cloud infrastructure.\n\n[Render's ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/render) goal is to help\ndevelopers, especially those in smaller companies, who don't have large DevOps\nteams, to still take advantage of modern development approaches in the cloud.\n\"We are focused on being the easiest and most flexible provider for teams to\nrun any application in the cloud,\" CEO and founder Anurag Goel explained.\n\nHe says that one of the biggest pain points for developers and startups, even\nfairly large startups, is that they have to build up a lot of DevOps expertise\nwhen they run applications in the cloud. \"That means they are going to hire\nextremely expensive DevOps engineers or consultants to build out the\ninfrastructure on AWS,\" he said. Even after they set up the cloud\ninfrastructure, and move applications there, he points out that there is\nongoing maintenance around patching, security and identity access management.\n\"Render abstracts all of that away, and automates all of it,\" Goel said.\n\nIt's not easy competing with the big players on scale, but he says so far they\nhave been doing pretty well, and plan to move much of their operations to bare\nmetal servers, which he believes will help stabilize costs further.\n\n![render DSC02051](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/render-\nDSC02051.jpg)\n\n\"Longer term, we have a lot of ideas [about how to reduce our costs], and the\nsimplest thing we can do is to switch to bare metal to reduce our costs pretty\nmuch instantly.\" He says the way they have built Render will make that easier\nto do. The plan now is to start moving their services to bare metal in the\nfourth quarter this year.\n\nEven though the company only launched in April, it is already seeing great\ntraction. \"The response has been great. We're now doing over 100 million HTTP\nrequests every week. And we have thousands of developers and startups and\neveryone from people doing small hobby projects to even a major presidential\ncampaign,\" he said.\n\nAlthough he couldn't share the candidate's name, he said they were using\nRender for everything including their infrastructure for hosting their web\nsite and their back-end administration. \"Basically all of their cloud\ninfrastructure is on Render,\" he said.\n\nRender has raised [a $2.2 million seed\nround](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/render-gets-2-25m-seed-round-as-\ninfrastructure-alternative-to-biggest-names-in-tech/) and is continuing to add\nservices to the product, including several new services it will announce this\nweek around storage, infrastructure as code and one-click deployment.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Investors eye new opportunities in edge, cloud and hyperscale data centres at Zurich forum -

The consultancy firm observed that 5G, IoT take up, adoption of SDN\nand NFV, video streaming and AR/VR would drive the growth, along with closing\n\u201cthe potential 64 zettabyte gap between global data centre traffic and useable\ndata created\u201d\n\nAs well as supporting businesses in the agriculture, banking, defence, mining\nand healthcare industries, EDCs are also critical to the continued development\nof Industry 4.0.\n\n\u201cUnlike traditional data centres that are often housed in large, specialised\nbuildings far from end users, edge data centres will be distributed closer to\nedge of the network and could be housed in smaller installations. By\ndecentralising data centre locations, it reduces latency to enable the promise\n5G applications,\u201d Stehlin said.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

world directly to you.**\n\n* * *\n\n**AWS announces general availability of Amazon Detective**\n\nAmazon Web Services has announced the general availability of Amazon\nDetective, its new security service that makes it easy for customers to\nconduct investigations into security issues across their AWS workloads.\n\nAmazon Detective automatically collects log data from a customer\u2019s resources\nand uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build\ninteractive visualizations.\n\n\u201cEven when customers tell us their security teams have the tools and\ninformation to confidently detect and remediate issues, they often say they\nneed help when it comes to understanding what caused the issues in the first\nplace,\u201d said Dan Plastina, Vice President for Security Services at AWS.\n\n\u201cGathering the information necessary to conduct effective security\ninvestigations has traditionally been a burdensome process, which can put\ncrucial in-depth analysis out of reach for smaller organisations and strain\nresources for larger teams.\n\n\u201cAmazon Detective takes all of that extra work off of the customer\u2019s plate,\nallowing them to focus on finding the root cause of an issue and ensuring it\ndoesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**Canonical announces Managed Apps for enterprise cloud operations**\n\nCanonical has announced a Managed Apps service that enables enterprises to\nhave their apps deployed and operated by Canonical as a fully managed service.\n\nThe company said it will cover ten widely used cloud-native database and LMA\n(logging, monitoring and alerting) apps on multi-cloud Kubernetes but also on\nvirtual machines across bare-metal, public and private cloud.\n\n\u201cAs organisations increasingly move to a cloud-native approach, they can be\nslowed down by spending too much time on the underlying management of their\ncloud and its applications,\u201d said Stephan Fabel, Director

The new node makes\nhigher availability possible and protects customers against calamities.\n\n\u201cThe use of public cloud solutions is increasing considerably due to the\nincreasing digitization and is expected to triple in the coming five years,\u201d\nsaid Sake Algra, Managing Director T-Systems Netherlands.\n\n\u201cThen you need to be able to expand quickly, reliably.

the huge value embodied in the hosting of\ntheir IT and telecommunications infrastructure at a secure external site that\noperates on the highest international standards like those we offer.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason that our Herzliya facility has filled up with the IT\ninfrastructure of leading organizations and led us to understand that we must\nexpand and build an additional

equipping huge data\ncentres, which grew in number to 512 at the end of Q4\n\n* * *\n\n**The Edge Data Centre Working Group, launched by the Telecommunications\nIndustry Association (TIA) in 2018, has launched a series of research papers\nto support the continued development of edge data centres (EDCs).**\n\nCovering topics from the types of EDCs to physical security concerns, thermal\nmanagement and considerations for selecting a host site, the series is part of\nthe group\u2019s work to create \u201ccritical global standards\u201d for the emerging EDC\nmarket.\n\n\u201cAs we rely more and more on data and the internet during this pandemic\ncoronavirus outbreak, ensuring we can trust the safety and reliability of the\nnetwork and data infrastructure is proving more important than ever,\u201d said TIA\nCEO David Stehlin.\n\n\u201cEdge data centres will be imperative to achieving the low-latency, real-time\ncommunication needed to support emerging 5G technologies like autonomous cars,\ncellular IoT, and smart cities. TIA\u2019s Edge Data Centre Working Group is at the\nforefront of the industry, pioneering new global standards for this exciting\nnew technology infrastructure,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, one area of research assesses the interaction between facilities\non the inner, outer and far edge, and how these centres can support 5G\nwireless application in a rural environment (see graphic).\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/image.png?x13542)Source: TIA\n\nData from PwC predicts that the edge data centre market will nearly triple by\n2024, rising from a value of $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion before mid-\ndecade.

morning, and NEXTDC plans to accelerate the development\nof its Sydney data centre.\n\nThe company\u2019s S3 Sydney data centre is located in Gore Hill, and is 8km from\nits S1 and S2 facilities.\n\nNEXTDC launched a $409 million (AU$672 million) institutional placement on\nThursday, worth 25% of its shares on issue.\n\nIt was reported that the offer was delivered at a 9.4% discount, and took\nplace the day after NEXTDC shares hit a record high of $9.18, according to\nAustralia\u2019s [Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/street-talk/asx-gives-an-\ninch-nextdc-runs-672m-miles-20200402-p54ga5).\n\n\u201cBased on the strong customer demand and commitment we have received for S2\nand our growing confidence in the forward-looking pipeline, we are confident\nthat the projected demand in Sydney, together with our return expectations,\nwarrants the next phase of investment in

For its fourth quarter\nthe German firm said new cloud orders \u2013 otherwise known as bookings - rose\n19%, but ten percentage points of this rise were down to one large customer\nswitching from on-premise business software to a cloud version of it.\n\nIn the third quarter, cloud bookings had increased 39%. In the second quarter,\nSAP also reported a slowdown in fresh cloud orders.\n\nFor the full year, overall group sales were \u20ac27.6bn on an adjusted basis, up\n9% on the previous year at constant currencies. Operating profit rose 11% to\n\u20ac8.2bn.  \n  \nThe company is still absorbing a huge restructuring charge last year of almost\n\u20ac1bn, after it started laying off or transferring thousands of staff into\nother roles as it further pivoted away from traditional on-premise software\nbusiness.\n\nSAP said it expected adjusted cloud revenues of \u20ac8.7bn to \u20ac9bn in 2020, which\nis a rise of between 24% and 28% at constant currencies. This projection\nthough would represent a slowdown from last year\u2019s 35% reported growth.  \n  \nThe posted results saw SAP's share price drop by 3%. This was despite the firm\nforecasting a group operating profit of between \u20ac8.9bn and \u20ac9.3bn for full\nyear 2020, which is ahead of the previous \u20ac8.8bn to \u20ac9.1bn company projection.\n\n  * More On:\n  * [SAP](https://data-economy.com/tag/sap/)\n  * [Results](https://data-economy.com/tag/results/)\n  * [restructure](https://data-economy.com/tag/restructure/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/sap-cloud-software-orders-slow-in-final-quarter-of-the-year/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/sap-cloud-software-orders-slow-in-final-quarter-of-the-year/&text=SAP cloud software orders slow in final quarter of the year via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/sap-cloud-software-orders-slow-in-final-quarter-of-the-year/&mini=true&title=SAP cloud software orders slow in final quarter of the year)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fsap-cloud-software-orders-slow-in-final-quarter-of-the-year%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n# More News\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-\nremote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/ngd-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed\nsum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-\ndata-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/John-Souter-\nuse-200x120.png?x13542)\n\n# [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-\neconomy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n  * [Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/cloud/)\n  * [Europe](https://data-economy.com/tag/europe/)\n\n# Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond\n\n* * *\n\nBy [Sponsored Content](https://data-economy.com/author/sponsored-content/)\nPublished: 04:00, 8 April, 2020  Updated: 17:45, 7 April, 2020\n\n* * *\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/&text=Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/&mini=true&title=Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Flinxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-682x395.jpg?x13542) Linxdatacenter\nintroduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond\n\n* * *\n\n**Global health crisis accelerates need, company responds.**\n\n[Linxdatacenter](https://www.linxdatacenter.com/), an international provider\nof data storage, cloud and telecom solutions, has created an IT toolkit that\nenables businesses to continue effective operations under quarantine \u2013 and\nafterward.\n\nEarlier, Linxdatacenter announced free-of-charge access to cloud services for\ncompanies whose business was suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes. For instance,\nthey can easily add remote desktops so their employees can continue to work\nwhile forced to stay at home.\n\nVia Linxdatacenter, businesses can use global networking services; connect\ntheir IT infrastructure in Russia and abroad; and link to the largest SDN\nproviders, traffic and content-exchange networks all over the world: (IX)\nEquinix, DE-CIX, London-IX and AMS-IX.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

With these points of presence, Linxdatacenter can organize the\nconnection to global providers and services in only one or two days.\n\nAs the owner of traffic exchange points at its own sites, Linxdatacenter helps\ncarriers lower-traffic latency. Connection to IX Linxdatacenter enables\ncompanies \u2013 with services deployed on such platforms as Amazon, Google and\nAzure \u2013 to build dedicated circuits to global cloud providers and further\nreduce the time to access their resources.\n\nThanks to Linxdatacenter connectivity with global providers, companies can set\nup virtual workplaces with maximum security on any platform they choose:\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Nutanix Xi Cloud,\nOracle Cloud, and others.\n\nLinx Remote Toolkit supports employees working off-site and staff hired\ntemporarily, as it allows the prompt launch of the whole complex of necessary\nsoftware: office and conference applications, a full set of security tools,\nand a secure VPN connection.\n\nThe remote-desktop service consists of terminal servers with RDP connection\nbased on the Linxdatacenter cloud, virtual workstations on Amazon WorkSpaces,\nand Microsoft Office 365 services in the cloud. It includes tools for\ncorporate data protection: secure VPN connection, information security tools,\nuser-device scanning, and multifactor authentication.  \n\nThe risk of infrastructure and data loss is particularly high in situations\nthat involve large-scale remote work. Linxdatacenter bases its backup tools on\nVeeam Software. Backup, recovery and replication \u2013 managed through a\nfunctional console \u2013 ensure reliable access to data and applications. Using\nLinxdatacenter cloud, companies can avoid the necessity of supporting their\nown external infrastructure for backup.\n\n\u201cBusinesses urgently need solutions for increasing IT capacity and circuit\nbandwidth. The load on circuits will continue to grow during the pandemic and\nafterwards. To take just one example, companies that traditionally operated\noffline are now going online with videoconferences. Whoever thought that\nsports studios would have to start digital training to stay in business?\n\n\u201cI am sure that our Remote Toolkit will help many companies ride out this\nstorm, and even transform their businesses for the future,\u201d says Olga\nSokolova, General Director, Linxdatacenter.\n\n* * *\n\n**About _Linxdatacenter_**\n\n_Linxdatacenter, with headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is a global\nprovider of high-quality colocation, cloud and connectivity solutions for\nbusiness.

up, according to an internal investigation made by the cloud firm.**\n\nThe outage occurred on Thursday 26th March 2020, and resulted in the shutdown\nof Google\u2019s cloud services in several regions, including Dataflow, [Big Query,\nDialogFlow, Kubernetes Engine](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-unveils-\ndecade-end-digital-transformation-triumphs-at-next-19/), Cloud Firestore, App\nEngine and Cloud Console.\n\nAt 16:14 US/Pacific time, Cloud IAM experienced elevated error rates, which\ncaused disruption across many services for a duration of 3.5 hours, and stale\ndata (resulting in continued disruption in administrative operations for a\nsubset of services) for a duration of 14 hours.\n\nThe company revealed that what triggered the incident was a bulk update of\ngroup memberships that expanded to an unexpectedly high number of modified\npermissions, which generated a large backlog of queued mutations to be applied\nin real-time.\n\nThe processing of the backlog was degraded by a latent issue with the cache\nservers, which led to them running out of memory; this, in turn, resulted in\nrequests to IAM timing out.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is

By developing a\nnew, next-generation statistics platform on AWS, using Amazon SageMaker - a\nfully managed service to build, train and deploy ML models \u2013 the Bundesliga\nwill offer fans real-time predictions on when a goal is likely to be scored,\nidentify potential goal-scoring opportunities and highlight how teams are\npositioning and controlling the field.\n\nThis will all be based on live data streams and historical data from over\n10,000 Bundesliga games. Bundesliga also plans to leverage AWS ML services,\nsuch as Amazon Personalize (an ML service to create real-time and\nindividualised recommendations) to offer fans personalised game footage,\nmarketing promotions and search results based on their favourite teams,\nplayers or matches.\n\nUsing other AWS ML services, including Amazon Rekognition - an intelligent\nimage and video analysis service - Bundesliga will build a cloud-based media\narchive that will automatically tag specific frames, from its more than\n150,000 hours of video, with metadata such as game, jersey, player, team and\nvenue. As a result, the league will easily be able to search historical\nfootage and surface pivotal plays for in-game broadcasts in more than 200\ncountries.\n\nThis archive will enable Bundesliga to search across its entire history of\nfootball footage to provide a more enhanced viewing experience for fans and\nautomate the current manual process of searching and tagging match highlights.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely excited to be working alongside AWS to develop the next\ngeneration of football viewing experience,\u201d said Christian Seifert, CEO of\nBundesliga. \u201cInnovation means challenging the status quo. Working closely with\nAWS significantly enhances the investment we\u2019ve made in innovation over the\npast two decades, all of which contributes to us being able to deliver a\nworld-class football experience for our fans.\u201d\n\nAndy Isherwood, vice president and managing director for EMEA at Amazon Web\nServices, said: \u201cAs the league with the highest average number of goals per\ngame, and the highest stadium attendance globally, the Bundesliga is one of\nthe most entertaining sports leagues in the world.\n\n\u201cWe will work with the Bundesliga to help them use cloud technology to give\nfootball fans around the world a more engaging match day experience and look\nforward to helping them leverage our deep portfolio of ML and AI services so\nthey can deliver even greater insight into the world\u2019s favourite game.\u201d\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Football](https://data-economy.com/tag/football/)\n  * [Germany](https://data-economy.com/tag/germany/)\n  *

beyond\n\n* * *\n\n**Global health crisis accelerates need, company responds.**\n\n[Linxdatacenter](https://www.linxdatacenter.com/), an international provider\nof data storage, cloud and telecom solutions, has created an IT toolkit that\nenables businesses to continue effective operations under quarantine \u2013 and\nafterward.\n\nEarlier, Linxdatacenter announced free-of-charge access to cloud services for\ncompanies whose business was suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Linx\nRemote Toolkit goes further, supporting firms forced to adapt their processes\nto work outside the office and struggling with increased load on their IT\ninfrastructure under quarantine.\n\nThe massive shift to remote work, the conversion of events and business trips\nto online mode, the growing demand for online services in general, these all\nlead to rising pressure on IT. Companies must now:\n\n  * organize new connections, \n  * increase circuit bandwidth, \n  * arrange access to resources in local server rooms, \n  * set up new applications for networking, \n  * and add more powerful information security tools as fast as possible. \n\nIn response, Linxdatacenter has created an ecosystem providing businesses with\nthese solutions on request:\n\n  * unlimited increase in IT capacity and circuit bandwidth,\n  * remote desktops with full setup, integration and security,\n  * plus backup and recovery.  \n\nLinxdatacenter bases these solutions on its own cloud platforms and data\ncentres and on the services of global providers including Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and Nutanix Xi.\n\nAccess to these global platforms enables companies to expand their IT\nresources quickly. No lack of hardware as the workload on their systems\nincreases means no interruption of their business processes. For instance,\nthey can easily add remote desktops so their employees can continue to work\nwhile forced to stay at home.\n\nVia Linxdatacenter, businesses can use global networking services; connect\ntheir IT infrastructure in Russia and abroad; and link to the largest SDN\nproviders, traffic and content-exchange networks all over the world: (IX)\nEquinix, DE-CIX, London-IX and AMS-IX.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

With these points of presence, Linxdatacenter can organize the\nconnection to global providers and services in only one or two days.\n\nAs the owner of traffic exchange points at its own sites, Linxdatacenter helps\ncarriers lower-traffic latency. Connection to IX Linxdatacenter enables\ncompanies \u2013 with services deployed on such platforms as Amazon, Google and\nAzure \u2013 to build dedicated circuits to global cloud providers and further\nreduce the time to access their resources.\n\nThanks to Linxdatacenter connectivity with global providers, companies can set\nup virtual workplaces with maximum security on any platform they choose:\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Nutanix Xi Cloud,\nOracle Cloud, and others.\n\nLinx Remote Toolkit supports employees working off-site and staff hired\ntemporarily, as it allows the prompt launch of the whole complex of necessary\nsoftware: office and conference applications, a full set of security tools,\nand a secure VPN connection.\n\nThe remote-desktop service consists of terminal servers with RDP connection\nbased on the Linxdatacenter cloud, virtual workstations on Amazon WorkSpaces,\nand Microsoft Office 365 services in the cloud. It includes tools for\ncorporate data protection: secure VPN connection, information security tools,\nuser-device scanning, and multifactor authentication.  \n\nThe risk of infrastructure and data loss is particularly high in situations\nthat involve large-scale remote work. Linxdatacenter bases its backup tools on\nVeeam Software. Backup, recovery and replication \u2013 managed through a\nfunctional console \u2013 ensure reliable access to data and applications. Using\nLinxdatacenter cloud, companies can avoid the necessity of supporting their\nown external infrastructure for backup.\n\n\u201cBusinesses urgently need solutions for increasing IT capacity and circuit\nbandwidth. The load on circuits will continue to grow during the pandemic and\nafterwards. To take just one example, companies that traditionally operated\noffline are now going online with videoconferences. Whoever thought that\nsports studios would have to start digital training to stay in business?\n\n\u201cI am sure that our Remote Toolkit will help many companies ride out this\nstorm, and even transform their businesses for the future,\u201d says Olga\nSokolova, General Director, Linxdatacenter.\n\n* * *\n\n**About _Linxdatacenter_**\n\n_Linxdatacenter, with headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is a global\nprovider of high-quality colocation, cloud and connectivity solutions for\nbusiness.

up, according to an internal investigation made by the cloud firm.**\n\nThe outage occurred on Thursday 26th March 2020, and resulted in the shutdown\nof Google\u2019s cloud services in several regions, including Dataflow, [Big Query,\nDialogFlow, Kubernetes Engine](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-unveils-\ndecade-end-digital-transformation-triumphs-at-next-19/), Cloud Firestore, App\nEngine and Cloud Console.\n\nAt 16:14 US/Pacific time, Cloud IAM experienced elevated error rates, which\ncaused disruption across many services for a duration of 3.5 hours, and stale\ndata (resulting in continued disruption in administrative operations for a\nsubset of services) for a duration of 14 hours.\n\nThe company revealed that what triggered the incident was a bulk update of\ngroup memberships that expanded to an unexpectedly high number of modified\npermissions, which generated a large backlog of queued mutations to be applied\nin real-time.\n\nThe processing of the backlog was degraded by a latent issue with the cache\nservers, which led to them running out of memory; this, in turn, resulted in\nrequests to IAM timing out.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is

in various regions by emergency\nrollouts performed to mitigate the high memory usage, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\u201cGoogle's commitment to user privacy and data security means that IAM is a\ncommon dependency across many GCP services,\u201d said the company on its\n[website](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20003#20003014).\n\n\u201cTo our Cloud customers, whose business was impacted during this disruption,\nwe sincerely apologise \u2013 this is not the level of quality and reliability we\nstrive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the\nplatform\u2019s performance and availability.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve\nthe resiliency of our service.\u201d\n\n**Read the latest from

(NASDAQ: MSFT)\n](https://data-economy.com/amazon-and-microsoft-could-now-share-10bn-jedi-\ncloud-contract/)continue to lead in the rest of the APAC region.\n\nThe new Q4 data revealed that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is the leading provider in\nChina and also the second-ranked provider in the total region, helped by its\ngrowing presence in multiple other APAC countries.\n\nTencent (HKG: 0700) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) are the second and third-ranked\ncompanies in China and are also in the ranking of leading regional providers,\naccording to the data.\n\nIn Japan, Fujitsu, NTT and Softbank are

Beyond China every major country market is led by Amazon and\nMicrosoft,\u201d said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at\nSynergy Research Group.\n\n\u201cJapan has a long list of powerful technology vendors and IT service\nproviders, but even there it is Amazon and Microsoft who lead the market.\n\n\u201cPutting China to one side, this speaks to the truly global nature of the\ncloud market. To become one of the leaders requires global presence,\ntechnology smarts, a brand name that plays well in all countries, extremely\ndeep pockets, a long-term focus and total commitment from senior management.\u201d\n\nThe report added that public IaaS and PaaS are the most prominent segments of\nthe cloud infrastructure services market and account for the bulk of the\nrevenues, with the balance coming from managed or hosted private cloud\nservices.\n\nWithin the APAC region, [China accounts for almost a third of the public cloud\nmarket](https://data-economy.com/chinese-cloud-firms-now-account-for-40-the-\nof-apac-cloud-market/) and is more than twice the size of Japan, which is the\nsecond-largest country market.\n\nThe next biggest country markets in the region are India, South Korea,\nAustralia, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Cloud](https://data-economy.com/tag/cloud/)\n  * [APAC](https://data-economy.com/tag/apac/)\n  * [china](https://data-economy.com/tag/china/)\n  * [Synergy Research Group](https://data-economy.com/tag/synergy-research-group/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&text=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/local-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region/&mini=true&title=Local Chinese companies dominate cloud market in the region)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Flocal-chinese-companies-dominate-cloud-market-in-the-region%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n# More News\n\n![Linxdatacenter](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/remote_work-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and\nbeyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-\nremote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/work-200x120.png?x13542)\n\n# [Google Cloud suffers 14-hour outage caused by 'large backlog of queued\nmutations'](https://data-economy.com/google-cloud-suffers-14-hour-outage-\ncaused-by-large-backlog-of-queued-mutations/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/taipei-1851948_1920-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [Colt Technology Services to provide hosting capability to Taiwan's three\nexchanges](https://data-economy.com/colt-technology-services-to-provide-\nhosting-capability-to-taiwans-three-exchanges/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

That has become a bit of a tradition and isn't\nnecessarily anything new, but for 2019, it also gave users a look back at how\nthey used Spotify over the last decade. Because this was quite a large job,\nSpotify gave us a bit of a look under the covers of how it generated these\nlists for its ever-growing number of free and paid subscribers.\n\nIt's no secret that Spotify is a big [Google\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/google) Cloud Platform user. Back in\n2016, the music streaming service publicly said that it was going to [move to\nGoogle Cloud](https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/23/spotify-announces-google-\ncloud-platform-partnership/), after all, and in 2018, it disclosed that it\nwould spend at least $450 million on its Google Cloud infrastructure in the\nfollowing three years.\n\nIt was also back in 2018, for that year's Wrapped, that Spotify ran the\nlargest [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) job ever\nrun on the platform, a service the company started experimenting with a few\nyears earlier. \"Back in 2015, we built and open-sourced a big data processing\nScala API for Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow called Scio,\" Spotify's VP\nof Engineering Tyson Singer told me. \"We chose Dataflow over\n[Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) because it scales with less\noperational overhead and Dataflow fit with our expected needs for streaming\nprocessing. Now we have a great open-source toolset designed and optimized for\nDataflow, which in addition to being used by most internal teams, is also used\noutside of Spotify.\"\n\nFor Wrapped 2019, which includes the annual and decadal lists, Spotify ran a\njob that was five times larger than in 2018 -- but it did so at three-quarters\nof the cost. Singer attributes this to his team's familiarity with the\nplatform. \"With this type of global scale, complexity is a natural\nconsequence. By working closely with Google Cloud\u2019s engineering teams and\nspecialists and drawing learnings from previous years, we were able to run one\nof the most sophisticated Dataflow jobs ever written.\"\n\nStill, even with this expertise, the team couldn't just iterate on the full\ndata set as it figured out how to best analyze the data and use it to tell the\nmost interesting stories to its users. \"Our jobs to process this would be\nlarge and complex; we needed to decouple the complexity and processing in\norder to not overwhelm Google Cloud Dataflow,\" Singer said. \"This meant that\nwe had to get more creative when it came to going from idea, to data analysis,\nto producing unique stories per user, and we would have to scale this in time\nand at or below cost. If we weren\u2019t careful, we risked being wasteful with\nresources and slowing down downstream teams.\"\n\nTo handle this workload, Spotify not only split its internal teams into three\ngroups (data processing, client-facing and design, and backend systems), but\nalso split the data processing jobs into smaller pieces. That marked a very\ndifferent approach for the team. \"Last year Spotify had one huge job that used\na specific feature within Dataflow called\n\"[Shuffle](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-cloud-\ndataflow-shuffle-for-up-to-5x-performance-improvement-in-data-analytic-\npipelines).\" The idea here was that having a lot of data, we needed to sort\nthrough it, in order to understand who did what. While this is quite powerful,\nit can be costly if you have large amounts of data.\"\n\nThis year, the company's engineers minimized the use of Shuffle by using\nGoogle Cloud's Bigtable as an intermediate storage layer. \"Bigtable was used\nas a remediation tool between Dataflow jobs in order for them to process and\nstore more data in a parallel way, rather than the need to always regroup the\ndata,\" said Singer. \"By breaking down our Dataflow jobs into smaller\ncomponents -- and reusing core functionality -- we were able to speed up our\njobs and make them more resilient.\"\n\nSinger attributes at least a part of the cost savings to this technique of\nusing Bigtable, but he also noted that the team decomposed the problem into\ndata collection, aggregation and data transformation jobs, which it then split\ninto multiple separate jobs. \"This way, we were not only able to process more\ndata in parallel, but be more selective about which jobs to rerun, keeping our\ncosts down.\"\n\nMany of the techniques the engineers on Singer's teams developed are currently\nin use across Spotify. \"The great thing about how Wrapped works is that we are\nable to build out more tools to understand a user, while building a great\nproduct for them,\" he said. \"Our specialized techniques and expertise of Scio,\nDataflow and big data processing, in general, is widely used to power\nSpotify\u2019s portfolio of products.\"\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "When the Cloud Falls to Earth.

As more organizations adopt a multi-cloud\nstrategy, Looker customers and partners can expect continued support of all\ncloud data management systems like Amazon Redshift, Azure SQL, Snowflake,\nOracle, Microsoft SQL Server and Teradata,\" Kurian wrote.\n\n> [Google continues to preach multi-cloud approach with Looker\n> acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/google-continues-to-preach-\n> multi-cloud-approach-with-looker-acquisition/)\n\nAs is typical in a deal like this, Looker CEO Frank Bien sees the much larger\nGoogle giving his company the resources to grow much faster than it could have\non its own. \"Joining Google Cloud provides us better reach, strengthens our\nresources, and brings together some of the best minds in both analytics and\ncloud infrastructure to build an exciting path forward for our customers and\npartners. The mission that we undertook seven years ago as Looker takes a\nsignificant step forward beginning today,\" Bien [wrote in his\npost](https://looker.com/blog/google-closes-looker-acquisition).\n\nAt the time the deal was announced in June, the company shared a slide, which\nshowed where Looker fits in what they call their \"Smart Analytics Platform,\"\nwhich provides ways to process, understand, analyze and visualize data.

Thinking of deploying edge computing? Here are four approaches.\n\nBased on enterprise strategies, the use cases addressed and the underlying\nbusiness case, Communication Service Providers (CSPs) can use four different\ndeployment options, or a combination of those options that address new edge\nbusiness opportunities.\n\n![VR\nGoggles](/4915bb/assets/global/qbank/2020/02/14/vr_goggles-108293crop056886884888resize1500844autoorientbackground23ffffffquality90stripextensionjpgid8.jpg?w=1212&h=682&mode=crop)\n\n######\n\nFeb 17, 2020 | __2 min.\n\n[Henrik Backstrom](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik\nB\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\n[ ![Henrik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m](/4ade12/assets/global/qbank/2018/11/21/henrik-\nbackstrom-100904resize759759crop0-1759760autoorientquality90stripbackground23ffffffextensionjpgid82.jpg)\n](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\n[Henrik Backstrom](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik\nB\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\nProduct Marketing Manager at Digital Services\n\n[Henrik Backstrom](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik\nB\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\n[ ![Henrik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m](/4ade12/assets/global/qbank/2018/11/21/henrik-\nbackstrom-100904resize759759crop0-1759760autoorientquality90stripbackground23ffffffextensionjpgid82.jpg)\n](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\n[Henrik Backstrom](/en/blog/contributors/e-h/henrik-backstrom \"Henrik\nB\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m\")\n\nProduct Marketing Manager at Digital Services\n\nCategory & Hashtags\n\n###### Category\n\n[Cloud and virtualization](/en/tags/category/cloud \"Cloud and virtualization\")\n[Edge computing](/en/tags/category/edge-computing \"Edge computing\")\n\n### Edge computing is an enabler of new services\n\nCommunication Service Providers (CSP) are looking for new revenue sources to\ngrow their businesses, especially in the enterprise area, which will be\nincreasingly important in the future. According to the Ericsson report '[5G\nfor business: a 2030 market compass](/4a8e35/assets/local/5g/the-5g-for-\nbusiness-a-2030-compass-report-2019.pdf)', by 2030 as much as USD 700 billion\nof the 5G-enabled, business-to-business value could be addressed by CSPs.\nHowever, the edge is not a standalone product or an offering but an enabler\nfor use-cases requiring security, resilience, and low latency in combination\nwith other technical solutions like private networks.\n\n![requirements on Edge computing](/491715/assets/global/qbank/2020/02/14/meet-\ntough-requirements-with-edge-\ncomputing-114735crop8301527859resize1500844autoorientbackground23ffffffquality90stripextensionjpgid8.jpg?w=1212)\n\n\n\n### Partnering in the edge ecosystem is foundational for CSPs\n\nA vast number of companies participate in the ecosystem, from hardware\nvendors, platform companies to applications developers, System Integrator (SI)\ncompanies and CSPs. Two other key players in the ecosystem are the Hyperscale\nCloud Providers (HCP) and Operations Technology (OT) vendors. HCPs, such as\nAWS, Microsoft Azure, Google and AliCloud have the core business to provide\ncloud infrastructure and platforms, and OT vendors have IoT platforms and\napplications, supported by edge computing components. Some examples of these\ncompanies include Siemens and General Electric.\n\nIn order to succeed with edge computing, CSPs will, in many cases, need access\nto the adequate domain (industry vertical) knowledge through partners, such as\nHCPs and the OT vendors. Partnering with these companies will often be\nnecessary to reach the application ecosystem to enable use cases and play a\nrelevant role in providing them to enterprise customers.\n\n\n\n### Edge computing deployment options\n\nSo how should CSPs go about addressing an edge computing opportunity? Based on\ntheir enterprise strategies, the use cases addressed and the underlying\nbusiness case, CSPs can take different roles in the value chain, or use\ndifferent deployment options. The roles are categorized based on whether they\nwant to build edge infrastructure and whether they want to front the\nenterprise. Fronting the enterprise means that CSPs have more than the\nrelationship for connectivity, but also the relationship to influence the\nenterprise choice of edge deployment option. A CSP can take a single role, or\na combination of the roles described below as part of the strategy, for\nexample, towards different industry verticals depending on how strong their\nrelations are. Ericsson has identified four main roles for CSPs:\n\n  * Full Edge Provider\n  * Partner Edge Provider\n  * Aggregator Edge Provider\n  * Limited Edge Provider\n\nWhich role, or roles, suit you and your enterprise strategy the best? To\nanalyze that and select a suitable deployment strategy, one can go through a\nset of questions addressing areas like competence in enterprise verticals,\ncapacity to provide complex solutions and go-to-market capabilities, for\nexample.\n\nLearn more about edge computing for CSPs and how they can address new business\nopportunities, using one or a combination of deployment options identified by\nEricsson.\n\n####  [](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/white-papers/edge-\ncomputing-and-deployment-strategies-for-communication-service-providers)\n\n[Download white paper](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/white-\npapers/edge-computing-and-deployment-strategies-for-communication-service-\nproviders \"Download white paper\")\n\nRead more about:\n\n[Edge computing](/en/digital-services/trending/edge-computing)\n\n[Cloud native infrastucture](/en/digital-services/trending/cloud-native#go-\ncloud-native)\n\n[5G Core](/en/digital-services/offerings/core-network/5g-core)\n\n######\n\n####  [](https://foryou.ericsson.com/blog-subscription-center.html)\n\n[Subscribe to the blog](https://foryou.ericsson.com/blog-subscription-\ncenter.html \"Subscribe to the blog\")\n\n###### RELATED CONTENT\n\n###### The Ericsson Blog\n\nLike what you\u2019re reading?

MTS has made security improvements to the card, but it still doesn\u2019t fully meet industry standards.\n  * The [Compass Cloud mobile app](https://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/09/mts-launching-mobile-ticketing-app-limits/) released two years ago was originally supposed to give riders access to all fare options, but MTS changed the plan. Riders still can\u2019t purchase one-way tickets with it.\n\nMTS hopes the $34 million tap-and-go plan \u201cwill be close to our ideal system\u201d\nwhen it starts at the end of 2021, agency spokesman Rob Schupp said. The cost\nincludes $11 million for a decade of operation and maintenance.\n\n__Billions of federal, state and local tax dollars are spent annually on\ntransportation projects in San Diego County. Where that money should be spent\nin the future is being debated by politicians, transportation planners and\ntaxpayers.\n\nEven if there weren\u2019t problems with the existing fare system, the upgrade\nwould be necessary. Schupp called the current system \u201cworn out.\u201d Replacement\nparts for the hardware are no longer available, and the software isn\u2019t being\nserviced anymore, he said.\n\nMTS will pay for the new fare system with federal money and funds from a\nquarter-cent state sales tax that\u2019s [dedicated to transit\nprojects](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/rail-and-mass-\ntransportation/transportation-development-act). A spokeswoman for the North\nCounty Transit District said that agency will also switch to the same fare\nsystem as MTS but has yet to decide how much to spend or how it will be\nfunded.\n\nColin Parent, executive director of the nonprofit [Circulate San\nDiego](http://www.circulatesd.org/), hopes this time that MTS and NCTD take\nfull advantage of the latest fare technology so the collection system attracts\nnew riders and makes it easier for existing customers to use the region\u2019s\nbuses, trolleys and trains.\n\n\u201cCurrently, they're not using the technology that they have in all the ways\nthat they could,\u201d said Parent, who also is a La Mesa councilman. \u201cJust because\nthey have the new technology doesn't mean they're going to make the right\nchoices about how to use the technology.\u201d\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/07092019_COMPASS-\nPASS_BQ-02.jpg?w=955)![](https://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/07092019_COMPASS-PASS_BQ-02.jpg?w=955)\n\nThis photo, taken on July 9, 2019, shows MTS\u2019s adult Compass Card and the\nCompass Card app. _(Brandon Quester/inewsource)_\n\nOne bus rider frustrated by the current system is Kristie Edgmond, a 68-year-\nold semi-retired accountant. She said she rides the bus a couple of times a\nweek to go downtown from her home in University Heights.\n\nEdgmond would prefer to use the Compass Cloud app, but it won\u2019t let her buy\none-way tickets. Rather than pay with cash for a one-way fare, she said she\nbuys a monthly pass \u2014 and that means she overpays by about $7 a month.\n\n\u201cOf course, it's inconvenient, but I've gotten used to that here,\u201d Edgmond\nsaid.\n\nSchupp said the new fare system will [mimic\none](https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2019/04/no-more-paper-tickets-\nmobile-app-in-2020-trimet-says.html) launched two years ago in Portland,\nOregon. It will still let riders use cash to pay for bus and trolley rides and\nto purchase passes at ticket-vending machines, he said.\n\nBut with tap-and-go, riders will also have the option of using credit cards\nwith smart chips, mobile wallets on Android and iPhones, and a reusable card.\nThey\u2019ll use their card or phone to tap a device on the bus or trolley, and the\nfare will be deducted from their accounts.\n\nTicket charges will cap out when riders reach the total fare for a daily or\nmonthly pass. MTS hopes this will incentivize people to use mass transit\nbecause they\u2019ll be guaranteed the best price. This also means customers won\u2019t\nhave the upfront expense of purchasing a daily or monthly pass that they might\nnot use the full value of.\n\n![shadow-ornament](https://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-\ncontent/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/divider/shadow-\nornament.png?resize=81%2C40&ssl=1)![shadow-\nornament](https://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-\ncontent/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/divider/shadow-\nornament.png?resize=81%2C40&ssl=1)\n\n* * *\n\n**We'll let you know when big things happen.**  \nEmail address:\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://inewsource.org/2019/07/15/san-diego-mts-bus-fare-system/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://inewsource.org/2019/07/15/san-diego-mts-bus-fare-system/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://inewsource.org/2019/07/15/san-diego-mts-bus-fare-system/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://inewsource.org/2019/07/15/san-diego-mts-bus-fare-system/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * \n\n[bus rapid transit](https://inewsource.org/tag/bus-rapid-transit/) [bus\nroute](https://inewsource.org/tag/bus-route/) [Compass\nCloud](https://inewsource.org/tag/compass-cloud/) [Metropolitan Transit\nSystem](https://inewsource.org/tag/mts/)\n[transportation](https://inewsource.org/tag/transportation/) 2019-07-15\n\n**[Lauren J.
