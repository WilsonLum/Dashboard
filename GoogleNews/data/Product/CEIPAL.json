recent survey is correct, AI will continue to take the recruiting world\nby storm, especially when it comes to tracking job seekers.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December 27, 2019 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Recruiting](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting/) |\n[Recruiting Trends & Talent Tech\nLIVE](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting-trends-\ntalent-tech-conference/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/RobotoHand700-700x450.jpg)\n\nIt looks like 2020 is going to be a major year for artificial intelligence in\nthe recruiting space.\n\nAccording to a recent global survey, two-thirds of all staffing firms polled\nwill adopt AI-fueled applicant tracking systems (ATS) by the end of the coming\nyear.\n\nThe global _Artificial Intelligence in the Recruiting Industry_ [benchmark\nsurvey](http://www.ceipal.com/artificial-intelligence-in-recruiting-industry-\nreport-2019), from CEIPAL, an SAAS front- and back-office staffing company\noperations vendor, found that 79% of enterprise staffing firms (with more than\n100 recruiters) will have done the same.\n\nNoting the disruption AI is causing within the ATS world, Sameer Penakalapati,\nCEIPAL\u2019s founder, says that the reality of AI technology in the recruiting\nspace has actually caught up to its buzz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\n\u201cWe want to quantify the sea change it\u2019s causing and share that data with our\ncustomers and the rest of the staffing world in preparation for the coming new\nyear,\u201d he says of his firm\u2019s survey.\n\nOther key findings include:\n\n  * Large-sized staffing firms (50-100 recruiters) showed relatively low awareness of AI-enabled ATS technology, even when compared to their smaller mid-sized (25-50 recruiters) counterparts.\n  * All respondents either \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that AI is the future of recruitment, and that its adoption will enable recruiters to build better relationships with candidates.\n  * Respondents indicated \u201cmarketing requirements\u201d are the biggest driver toward AI adoption, along with productivity, quality and reporting needs. Respondents who reported marketing requirements as a pain point were 23% more inclined to adopt AI in their recruitment practices (80% said they were likely to adopt) than those who did not report marketing as a pain point (65% said they were likely to adopt).\n  * The majority of respondents (71%) believe that AI will eliminate human bias from the recruitment process. However, there were 29% who \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with that sentiment.\n  * More than half of today\u2019s recruits span a generation that has famously shunned email and phone calls in favor of texting. Unsurprisingly, 52% of respondents strongly agreed that AI-enabled chatbots, for example, will improve productivity and the recruitment experience of those candidates.\n\nSurvey results indicate that AI will help overcome some of the core challenges\nfacing today\u2019s recruiters, as well as close rates by improving the marketing\nof open job requisitions, productivity and performance, and candidate sourcing\nand matching, according to Penakalapati.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nGeographically speaking, southeast Asia leads the pack in AI adoption for\nrecruitment. Firms in the U.K. followed closely behind with U.S. firms\ntechnologically lagging behind both those regions. However, 60 percent of U.S.\nfirms intend to catch up within the year by incorporating AI technologies into\ntheir current practices.\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

Recruiting automation\ntools also collect and analyze recruiting data to provide insight into\nrecruitment efforts.\n\n  * **Generate leads** \u2014 Candidate leads may come from job boards, social platforms, employee referrals, company branding, online, TV, radio or print ads, to name a few.\n  * **Verify candidate information** \u2014 Recruiting tools verify pertinent candidate information, then export full candidate profiles into the tools, which may include [applicant tracking system (ATS)](https://www.g2.com/categories/applicant-tracking-system-ats) or [candidate relationship management](https://www.g2.com/categories/candidate-relationship-management) solutions.\n  * **Recruiting analytics** \u2014 This information provides insight into resumes and filters out unqualified applicants based on preset qualifications.\n\n## **[![View the Easiest-to-Use Applicant Tracking\u00a0Software \u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/fe9f2780-ff59-453f-a874-a63e6e5f70ac.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/fe9f2780-ff59-453f-a874-a63e6e5f70ac)**\n\n## Examples of recruiting automation technologies\n\nRecruiting automation software isn\u2019t the only solution for streamlining the\nhiring process. There are tools that help with every step, from candidate\nsourcing to hiring. These include:\n\n  * Automated job board posting\n  * Candidate sourcing\n  * Email automation\n  * Candidate relationship management including candidate engagement and experience solutions\n  * Candidate screening\n  * Applicant tracking systems (ATS) including resume screening\n  * Interview scheduling including video interviews\n  * Managing interview feedback\n  * Pre-employment screening, interviewing and background checks\n  * Candidate rediscovery and ranking\n\n## How automation will improve recruiting\n\nNot automating recruiting processes results in reduced productivity, increased\nadministrative expenses and a poor candidate experience. The benefits of\nrecruiting automation include increased productivity, reduced time to hire and\na larger and improved talent pool.\n\nRecruiting automation software provides recruiting departments with\nstreamlined time-saving solutions. They also provide insights into which\nrecruiting initiatives are thriving and why. Data analytics are an essential\nelement to any recruiting process. Software solutions are competing to provide\nthe most helpful recruiting analysis. Recruiting analytics can provide\nrecruiters with the following:\n\n  * Time to fill\n  * Time in process step\n  * Quality of hire\n  * Offer acceptance rate\n  * Application drop-off rate\n  * Candidate net promoter score\n  * Cost to fill\n\nWhen recruiters cannot keep up with the number of job candidates applying to\nall open positions, it is time to automate some essential recruiting tasks. If\nthere are enough recruiters to manage the recruiting strategy, then scaling\nwith software is the best option. If, however, you need more human power to\nhelp streamline the process, [recruitment marketing\nagencies](https://www.g2.com/categories/recruitment-marketing-agencies) can\nhelp. They help customize talent acquisition initiatives and create a set of\nmetrics to compare program results. Sometimes bringing in experts to create a\nstreamlined process is the best way to create a strong recruiting model. This\ncan then be optimized via software down the road.\n\n[![Find the best\u00a0Recruitment Marketing Agencies for 2019 \u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/141e1097-cb2c-49dd-90c9-48c5b6e7ac26.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/141e1097-cb2c-49dd-90c9-48c5b6e7ac26)\n\n### Best recruiting automation software in 2019\n\nThis list includes the top recruiting automation products based on user\nsatisfaction as of May 20, 2019.

Technology governs our work as well and demands that we stay\nready to adapt with agility and intelligence. With so much around us in a\nstate of constant flux, Human Capital Management (HCM) warrants a deeper\nunderstanding.\n\n## **1\\. What is Human Capital Management?**\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management, with the goal of achieving organizational competency for\nworkforce acquisition, management and optimization.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into HCM processes, features and strategies, let\u2019s take\na moment to focus on the key elements of the definition.\n\n**First** , HCM is not mere theories and rules \u2013 but rather a \u201cset of\npractices\u201d. The practical aspect of HCM is important because it points to the\nfact that in order to be practical, these systems need to stay relevant.\n\n**Second** , HCM is \u201cfocused on the organizational need\u201d. What might be\nperfect for organization A might be a completely wrong fit for organization B.\nThe point to be noted here is that while we are often bombarded with best\npractices for doing everything, the best practice to start with is often to\nstep away from the herd and find the best fit.\n\n**Third** , under the HCM canopy, we need to find the right competencies to\nfocus on with regard to \u201cworkforce acquisition, workforce management, and\nworkforce optimization\u201d. While the use of \u201cworkforce\u201d may seem a little dated\nin today\u2019s WoW (World of Work) of \u201ctalent\u201d speak, the definition does capture\nthe essence of HCM. Having said that, the practices under HCM need to evolve\nto keep pace with our growing relationship with technology.\n\nToday there are multiple HCM suite solutions available in the market. For\nexample, multi-feature, comprehensive suite offerings by Workday, SAP, Oracle,\nPeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer such a wide\nvariety of solutions that it leads to a decision dilemma in assessing what\nwould really work for a particular organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n## **2\\. The 3 core aspects of Human Capital Management (HCM)**\n\nHuman Capital Management covers a wide spectrum of talent acquisition and\nmanagement processes throughout the employee life cycle. To understand better,\nlet\u2019s divide the whole spectrum into three broad functionalities \u2013 **(A)\nTalent Acquisition (TA), (B) Talent Management and (C) Talent Optimization** \u2013\nand deep dive into the nuances within each of these categories.\n\n### **Talent Acquisition**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s always best to start at the beginning - where the employee life cycle\ncommences. To be precise though, it actually starts just before the TA\nprocesses with Talent Gap Analysis. Predictive workforce planning tools like\nSAP HR Analytics and Oracle HCM Cloud take into consideration the current\ntalent spread, the immediate talent requirements and business strategies to\nmap future requirements based on a holistic analysis.\n\nA comprehensive TA-centric Human Capital Management system needs to cater to\nthe needs of the primary TA process:\n\n  1. **[Recruitment/ eRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-recruitment/) \\- **This includes sourcing, screening, qualifying, and skill-matching\n  2. [**ATS (Application Tracking System)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)\n  3. **[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) \\- **background checks, joining formalities, orientation, and a 30-60-90 day growth plan to get the new recruit started.\n\n  \nSolutions like SuccessFactors, SilkRoad Life Suite, Taleo (Oracle talent\ncloud), ClearCompany HRM and TribeHR offer tools that focus on gaining access\nto and acquiring the right talent. Finding the right match in today\u2019s\nimpatient and volatile environment is as difficult as it is necessary. An\nefficient ATS, for example, not only makes the job of the smart recruiter\neasier, but also improves the candidate experience. Recruitment being the\nfirst engagement between an organization and a prospective employee, it\nmatters how well the system is managed.\n\nWhile smart recruitment algorithms and recruiting chatbots have made the\ninitial stages of sourcing and screening a lot easier, a comprehensive end-to-\nend TA HCM solution needs to deliver more than that. It needs to be able to\nhelp the TA manager with the processes of qualifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, scheduling\ninterviews and skillset-matching while helping to collect and store data for\nbackground checks, carry out joining processes and also helping chart out a\ngrowth plan for the first three months for the new joinee. A 30-60-90day plan\nnot only lends more credibility to the need for a particular talent bust also\nprovides the newbie with a business-goals-centric plan to get started during\nthe first three crucial months.\n\nHuman Capital Management suites can also make the first day at work a lot\nsmoother and a lot less daunting with conversational bots to guide the way and\nhelp in a preliminary orientation to software, processes and organizational\ncharts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n### **Talent Management**\n\n  \nThe nature of talent that present-day organizations have to manage has changed\nmore in the last decade than it had changed over the 30 years before that.\nWork is no longer a place but a function with teams dispersed across\ncontinents, freelancers pitching in and increasingly flexible work-hours.\nHuman Capital Management systems need to be aware of and conscious about these\nnew tweaks to the work ecosystem. Keeping that in mind, here are the must-have\nfeatures for a talent management HCM system:\n\n**1.** **Time and attendance**\n\n  * Leaves and Absence management\n  * Self-service application and tracking systems\n  * Biometrics and security\n\n  \nWith an increase in remote workers, freelancers and globally dispersed teams,\nmapping time and attendance while also maintaining security needs is crucial.\nTools like TimeAttend and CeiPal Workforce make it easier to track and manage\non-the-job timings, leave applications and security requirements. Moreover,\nHCM tools enable self-service by allowing employees to manage their data\nthemselves thus creating greater transparency and improved engagement.\n\n**2.** **Payroll**\n\n  * Compensation mapping\n  * Remuneration tracking and roll-out\n  * Compensation planning for gig workers\n\n  \nWhile the focus has been growing on the non-monetary aspects at work,\ncompensation and benefits would always remain a key motivator. No matter how\nhard we try to eliminate the transactional nature of jobs, at the end of the\nday, while the paycheck is not the only thing that matters, it surely matters\na lot. Using Human Capital Management tools to manage payroll has been in\npractice for quite a few years now since it is one of the easier things to\nautomate. AI-enabled payroll HCM like Zenefits and RUN help in mapping\nindustry trends to benchmark compensation plans for the different sets of\nworkers from full-time on-location to remote gig-workers.\n\n**3.** **Performance management**\n\n  * Goal-alignment\n  * Task-tracking\n  * Internal communication and team planning\n\nHCM systems encourage and enable better communication. These mechanisms allow\nanytime-anywhere access, help in planning goals, aligning individuals and\nteams on the relevant business objectives and also allow 360 degree task-\ntracking. With tools like Performly, AssessTEAM, PerformancePro and BirdDogHR,\norganizations can boost productivity in ways that are more congenial to\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)\n\n**4.** **Culture connect**\n\n  * Rewards and recognition\n  * Grievance addressal and redressal systems\n  * Weaving ethics into the system\n\n  \nWhat employees do at work everyday makes up the culture of the organization.\nWith tools like Globoforce and TinyPulse, organizations can build a branded\nculture of ethical behavior, recognition, gratitude and engagement. Moreover,\nwith Human Capital Management software, the culture can be translated to every\nemployee in all the functions that they serve and all the processes that they\nare a part of.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **Talent Optimization**\n\n  \nThe journey does not end with finding the right talent \u2013 it begins from there.\nIn that journey there can be no room for stagnation. Organizations need to\nconstantly try to create avenues for talent optimization \u2013 for individual and\ncollective growth, without turning on business goals and objectives. You need\nto future-proof your employees. Here are four ways in which the right HCM can\nenable that:\n\n  1. Career-pathing\n  2. Competency mapping\n  3. Succession planning\n  4. Learning and development\n\nWith a tailored HCM solution, organizations can not only train their employees\non immediate skill needs but also for the skill requirements of the future.\nCoursera, for example enables skills benchmarking with the use of AI\n(Artificial Intelligence). With efficient cloud-backed, data-driven HCM\nsystems, organizational leaders can make the right career-pathing decisions in\nadvance thus providing both the organization and the individual a map to\nfollow. Succession planning has been proven to a great way to optimize HiPos\nand the right HCM tools can help in decisions regarding the same by studying\ngallons of data. Tools like SuccessFactors HCM by SAP encourage diverse teams\nto collaborate better and optimize on the positives of having a team of very\ndifferent individuals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management?

The Right HCM Solution: Finding the \u201cSuite\u201d Spot**\n\nLike we stated in the beginning, when it comes to choosing an HCM suite, best-\nfit matters more than best practices.\n\nHere are some key considerations and questions when choosing the right HCM\nsolution\n\n### **1.** **Why do we need an HCM system?**\n\n  \nYou need to know what are the areas that need greater intervention, what are\nthe reasons that some processes have been difficult or stalled and what you\nwish you achieve with the investment in a new tool-system.\n\n### **2.** **What are the must-have and nice-to-have features we want?**\n\n  \nThe MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) priority\nlist is a great start for any decision. You need to be able to answer what the\nHCM solution must do, should do, could do and also what it would do in the\nfuture.\n\n### **3.** **Present budget v/s growth needs?**\n\n  \nTo answer this, you might first have to identify where in the spectrum you\nfall. Are you an SMB (small and medium business) with less than 1000\nemployees, an MM (mid-market) player with an employee strength between\n1000-5000, an enterprise with over 5000 employees, a well-established MNC with\nover 10000 employees or are you a cusp organization transitioning between\nthese segregations? Based on where you fall in the spectrum and where you are\nheaded, you need to choose a solution that caters to your immediate needs but\nthat is also dynamic enough to incorporate your future needs. Your budget\nwould differ accordingly.\n\n### **4.** **What is the level of customization you require?**\n\n  \nThere are multiple HCM suite players in the market today that offer need-based\nplans. Most basic plans do not allow for customization but you need to be\nclear about what customizations you would need.\n\n### **5.** **Are you ready to adapt?**\n\n  \nBefore you build your case for investing in a new or upgraded HCM solution,\nask yourself whether your organization is ready for the change. There is often\nthe need for training with the introduction of any new tool and employees need\nto be allowed some teething time as well. The organization must be willing and\ncapable of letting employees and HR adapt to the change.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the\nDifference?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/hris-vs-hcm-whats-the-difference/)\n\n## **The 5 Big HCM Trends for 2020**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse into the future and the five key trends that would shape up\nthe HCM space in the years to come:\n\n### **1\\. An end to worries about job-stealing-AI**\n\n  \nContrary to the \u201cAI Apocalypse\u201d narrative, recent studies point out that 93%\nof people are willing to take orders from a robot and 70% of employees are\nalready using some form of AI in their personal lives. By 2020, with this\nmentality seeping into work culture, employees would become a lot less fearful\nand a lot more adaptive to AI.\n\nThis would lead to greater, more effective human-AI collaboration in the\nsuper-job era, and better rationalization of high-value jobs and roles for\nhumans. It also means that HCM systems need to be set up to manage all kinds\nof \u2018employees\u2019 - human and non-human.\n\n### **2\\. AI will no longer be optional**\n\nAccording to a recent study by Oracle, 79% of HR leaders believe that failure\nto adopt AI will have a negative impact on their overall organization;\nhowever, only 6% of HR professionals are actively deploying AI solutions.\nRealizing this discrepancy will push more companies than ever \u2013 including\nthose that have traditionally been hesitant \u2013 to embrace artificially\nintelligent solutions.\n\nWhile more involvement and encouragement from the HR to create an AI-enabled\nwork culture would be ideal, the fact is that many HR teams are still\nstruggling with basic digital transformation and automation challenges. A\nstep-change approach is needed to ensure the drastic transformation - and your\nsystems need to be able to support this transformation with agility and scale.\n\n### **3\\. HR to lead the predictive analytics movement**\n\n  \nWhile many think of HR as a \u201csoft\u201d skill, the future of this industry is built\non the use of predictive analytics to make intelligent employee decisions. A\nrecent survey by HBR shows that 31% of HR professionals are already using AI-\nbacked data analysis to identify at-risk talent, source best-fit candidates\nvia resume analysis, and predict high-performing recruits. In 2020, I expect\nthis number to jump much higher.\n\nSmarter decisions backed by data and powered by predictive tools are on the\ncards, but what new skills do HR leaders need on their teams to ensure they\ncan make the most of these smart decision-making tools? What new workflows\nneed to be defined, designed and automated to ensure these smarter methods of\ntalent acquisition and employee retention are executed flawlessly\n\n### **4\\. Digital assistants will become \u201cco-workers\u201d**\n\n  \nDigital assistants, accessible through voice or SMS, work 24/7 and can provide\nnearly-instant, tailored responses on simple tasks like vacation balance and\nexpense approval to complicated subjects like taxes and benefits. Over time,\nthe digital assistants can even take on more sophisticated personas such as\nmentors, coaches or counselors.\n\nThe need to understand generational diversity at work better and in ways that\nare more actionable will be strategic to organizational success. Smart HCM\nSystems will create a seamless employee experience for everything from\nefficient and effective employee onboarding; day-to-day time-consuming tasks\nlike expense reporting; and career-defining initiatives such as coaching with\nreal-time, always-on systems that employees can access at their convenience\n\n### **5\\. Smarter, mobile recruitment**\n\n  \nWith the human attention span averaging just 8 seconds and the unemployment\nrate at its lowest in 50 years, applying for jobs needs to be easy and able to\nbe done on-the-go. Moving into 2020 and beyond, HR professionals will be\nforced to adapt their recruiting techniques to this new norm or risk losing\nquality talent to competitors.\n\nOrganizations need to create their employer brand based on candidate\nexpectations, technology trends, and the changing business environment. The\n\u2018last mile\u2019 between the job opportunity ad the potential candidate is a\ncrucial and vulnerable link - using technology to close that gap at the last\nmile with speed, accuracy and as per process is going to be central.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 5 Human Capital Management (HCM) Software Features for\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)\n\n## **Handle Change Meaningfully**\n\nIn conclusion, what needs to be kept in mind is that the right HCM solution\ncan prove to be a lot more than a system that simply manages data and\nprocesses better. It can be a tool to motivate your employees, to engage them\norganically and to provide an augmented employee experience through the\nduration of their employment or even career. That said, how well a Human\nCapital Management system functions within an organization depends on how well\nyou use it and how motivated your employees feel to adapt to the upgrade. In\nthe end, it\u2019s all about how you, the HR manager can HCM - handle change\nmeaningfully!\n\n**_Are you happy with the HCM system you use?

To accommodate that growth, he bought a 42,000-square-foot space\non Weiland Road last year, dubbed Avani Business Park, allowing the technology\ncompany plenty of room to grow.\n\nAvani Technology Solutions specializes in software development, custom\nsoftware solutions and IT consulting. Its premier product is CEIPAL, a cloud\nenterprise that helps small- and medium-sized businesses with paperless\nonboarding; collecting payroll data; timesheet management; and management of\nvacation times, benefits and more.\n\nIn addition to its Rochester business park, Avani Technology Solutions also\nhas a research and development center in India, a sales office in Virginia and\nsales representatives covering 10 states. The company grew by 50 employees in\nthe past year, and its planning to add 30 to 40 jobs by early 2016.\n\n\"We've been thinking about acquiring other companies that we have some special\ninterest in. We're looking for companies in the portal and mobile apps\nsecurity space. We're also hoping to acquire foreign companies. We looked at a\ncompany in Singapore a couple months ago,\" said the 42-year-old CEO, of\nGreece.\n\nWe spoke with the India native recently about how he plans to stay relevant,\nhis financial advice for new businesses and more:\n\n![Sameer Penakalapati](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/-mm-/2a8af4ebbd87520cf49e76ddc3e47a8f7c2d7919/c=83-0-1380-1729/local/-/media/2015/10/28/Rochester/Rochester/635816587362832691-IMG-0038.jpg?width=180&height=240&fit=crop)\n\nSameer Penakalapati (Photo: Sushen Penakalapati)\n\n **On maintaining processes:** \"The biggest challenge with the growth we're\nexperiencing is keeping a process-driven organization. I could manage a lot of\ninformation in my head until we were a $5 (million) or $6 million company.\nNow, it's very hard. So, I had to put a team together and we streamlined our\noperations. Our goal by 2020 is to become a $100 million company. That's only\npossible if we have sound processes and strategies in place, and I believe we\nhave that in place today.\"\n\n **On providing employees with freedom:** \"We have employees not only here but\nin 10 different states. We give them a lot of flexibility in work hours and\nwork schedules. We don't track employees' hours or days. We set the target,\nand we give them a lot of flexibility and freedom for them to complete the\ntask.\"\n\n **On the never-ending race:** \"We're a technology company, and technology\nchanges rapidly. If we do nothing and stay where we are, maybe in two years we\nwill be obsolete. So continuing to grow by adapting new technology and\nplatforms and creating new services and helping customers to take advantage of\nthose services and products will allow us to continue to have a company.\"\n\n **On international growth:** \"We are trying to expand our base in India to\nsell our products in India and Singapore. Those markets are growing crazily.\nWe will test the markets for other big ones like China. We will take a look at\nthe South American market. I think there's potential for us to go into the\ninternational market because they're adopting the new technologies, the mobile\nsolutions market, rapidly.\"\n\n **On building relationships with banks:** \"The problem for most growing\nbusinesses is keeping cash flow going. We have an excellent relationship with\nthe Chase bank, locally. They've supported our business growth since we were a\nsmall company in 2010. I think small businesses, especially, need to focus on\ncreating an excellent relationship with the banks and funding agencies to\ncontinue to have uninterrupted growth. I could stop growing and continue to\ncollect receivables and maintain the business, but if you want to grow and\nneed more funds, you can have a great partner to work with you.\"\n\n **For more information:** Avani Technology Solutions, Avani Business Park,\n687 Lee Road, Suite 208, Rochester, NY 14606.

what white men earned in 2018 alone. For a second year,\nLeanIn.Org and SurveyMonkey have partnered to conduct new research to measure\nAmericans\u2019 awareness of this pay gap and better understand the experiences of\nBlack women in the workplace, using SurveyMonkey Audience. The results are\nclear and troubling: Black women face far more barriers to advancement, and\nonly half of Americans think these obstacles still exist.\n\nOn average, Black women are paid 39 percent less than white men and 21 percent\nless than white women. Even when you control for industry, occupation, and\neducation, Black women on average are paid less than white men. According to\nthe National Partnership for Women and Families, if the pay gap were closed,\nin a single year a Black woman working full-time would be able to afford over\nthree years\u2019 worth of groceries, nearly two years of rent, or two and a half\nyears\u2019 worth of childcare.\n\nThe new research from LeanIn.Org and\n[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/the-pay-gap-is-the-tip-of-the-\niceberg-for-black-women/) shows that many people don\u2019t know that Black women\nare paid less or understand the magnitude of this pay gap. A third of\nAmericans don\u2019t know there\u2019s a pap gap between Black women and white men\u2014and\n42 percent of people who are aware of this pay gap underestimate its size.\nMoreover, half of Americans don\u2019t know there\u2019s a pay gap between Black women\nand white women.\n\n\u201cWhile many Americans don\u2019t realize the pay gap for Black women exists, Black\nwomen and their families certainly feel the effects. If the pay gap were\nclosed, the average Black woman would earn almost $950,000 more over the\ncourse of her career\u2014a staggering figure, especially when you consider nearly\n4 in 10 Americans say they\u2019d struggle to cover an unexpected $400 expense,\u201d\nsaid Rachel Thomas, co-founder, and CEO of [LeanIn.Org](https://leanin.org/).\n\n\u201cJust like last year, our research shows that awareness about the pay gap for\nBlack women remains too low,\u201d said Sarah Cho, Director of Research at\nSurveyMonkey. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing that Black women have far less access to\nopportunity in the form of job training and interactions with senior leaders.\nWe hope this research encourages companies to dig deeper into the\ninterconnected factors that contribute to this disparity so we can all make\nprogress in narrowing the gap.\u201d\n\nThe pay gap Black women face is only one piece of the story. This new research\nhighlights that Black women also experience a lack of access to opportunity:\n\n  * Less access to senior leaders: White men report having access to senior leaders at 3 times the rate as Black women\u2014and white women at twice the rate of Black women.\n  * Less mentorship and sponsorship: Fewer Black women have had a mentor or sponsor at some point in their career: 19 percent, compared to 27 percent of white women and 31 percent of white men.\n  * Less access to training: Fewer Black women have ever received job or executive leadership training in their career: 19 percent, compared to 30 percent of white women and 33 percent of white men.\n\n  \nThese findings are also supported by research from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey &\nCompany\u2019s Women in the Workplace, which shows that Black women face more\nbarriers to advancement and get less support:\n\n  * Less likely to be promoted: Despite doing their part and asking for raises as often as men and white women, Black women are less likely to be promoted. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 60 Black women are promoted. (Women in the Workplace 2018)\n  * Less support from managers. Only 25 percent of Black women report that their manager helps them navigate organizational politics, compared to 39 percent of white women and 41 percent of men. Black women are also less likely to get help balancing their work and personal lives (39 percent of Black women, compared to 48 percent of white women and 44 percent of men). (Women in the Workplace 2018)\n  * Less likely for managers to promote their accomplishments: 35 percent of Black women say that their managers promote their contributions to others, compared to 46 percent of white women and 46 percent of men. Black women are also less likely to get opportunities to showcase their work. (Women in the Workplace 2018)\n  * Experience everyday discrimination/microaggressions: 40 percent of Black women report having their judgment questioned in their area of expertise, compared to 36 percent of white women and 27 percent of men. And 42 percent of Black women are asked to provide evidence of their competence, compared to 29 percent of white women and 16 percent of men. (Women in the Workplace 2018)\n\n  \n_**HR News:**_ [CEIPAL Survey Reveals Artificial Intelligence Is the Future of\nRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/ceipal-survey-reveals-artificial-intelligence-is-the-future-of-\nrecruitment/)\n\nIn this year\u2019s SurveyMonkey and LeanIn.Org study, over a third of Americans\nsaid they believe offering leadership training, increasing wage transparency,\nand creating flexible workplace policies are effective ways to provide\nopportunities to help women and men advance equally. To address obstacles that\ncan contribute to the pay gap and prevent Black women from advancing,\nLeanIn.Org is issuing a series of recommendations for companies based on\nfindings from Women in the Workplace:\n\n**Put processes in place to ensure that employees doing the same work are\nbeing paid the same**\n\n  * Don\u2019t ask job candidates about their current compensation, which is illegal in some states and can perpetuate pay disparities\n  * Be transparent about the pay ranges for different roles so all employees know what to expect\n  * Audit compensation data regularly to maintain fairness\u2014and review the data by gender and race to ensure Black women are being paid fairly\n\n  \n**Ensure the performance review process is fair**\n\n  * Require diverse slates of candidates for promotions (only 26% of companies currently do this)\n  * Set clear performance evaluation criteria before the review process begins\u2014and put safeguards in place to make sure they\u2019re applied consistently\n  * Track outcomes on promotions by gender and race to make sure Black women are being treated fairly (only 18% of companies currently do this)\n\n  \n**Train employees to identify and challenge bias**\n\n  * Less than a third of employees say managers often challenge biased language and behavior when they see or hear it. Unconscious bias training can equip managers to be part of the solution (less than 50% of managers currently receive it)\n  * Employees involved in hiring and promotions should receive unconscious bias training to help them make more objective decisions (less than 20% of companies require unconscious bias training for employees involved in hiring and promotions)\n  * Lean In\u2019s 50 Ways to Fight Bias program highlights 50 specific examples of workplace bias and offers researched-back recommendations for what to do (available at no cost to companies)\n\n  \n**Double down on mentorship, sponsorship, and leadership training**\n\n  * Ensure formal mentorship and sponsorship programs are opening doors for Black women\n  * Encourage informal interactions between Black women and more senior colleagues\u2014these types of personal connections can be more effective than formal programs and propel careers\n  * Track participation in leadership training by gender and race to make sure Black women are fairly represented\n\n  \nAt leanin.org/bwepd, visitors can find the full findings and resources to\ncombat gender bias in the workplace.

Her oldest son, Reid, was able to say a final goodbye.\n\n\"I love you,\" the 16-year-old cried out to his brother as he lay in a grassy\nditch, pinned under the weight of their minivan. \"I love you, Lane.\"\n\nIt all happened so fast.\n\nMonday was supposed to be just like any other day. The mother spent the\nafternoon shopping with three of the kids, but Lane had his annual physical\nscheduled for 3:30 p.m. When she stopped home to pick him up, she ran inside,\njust for a minute. When she came out, the Dodge Caravan that she had parked at\nthe top of her gravel driveway was 50 feet away, poking out of a steep\nembankment. Luca, 12, was in hysterics. Lark, 4, and Felix, 2, were in their\nback seats, unable to grasp what had just happened.\n\nLane had tried to get into the van when, with his younger brother and sisters\ninside, it started to creep downhill, straight toward a street humming with\nfast-moving cars. After grabbing the steering wheel through the driver's-side\ndoor in an attempt to pilot his siblings to safety, Lane scampered behind the\nhulking van, threw all his strength against two tons of automobile, but was\npulled underneath. He was killed looking out for his family.\n\n\"He died a hero,\" said Lane's grandmother, Carolyn Bradley.\n\n\"He saved my life,\" Luca said.\n\nWhat caused the van to roll downhill is unclear, as investigators are still\nsorting out how the accident unfolded, said Trooper Mark Ceipel, a State\nPolice spokesman.\n\nLane ran outside to the van just as his mother went inside the house. The\nengine was off, the van was in park and the keys were in the ignition. The\nrear sliding door on the driver's side was locked, so Luca reached over from\nthe passenger's seat and tried to turn the ignition on, thinking that would\ntrigger the electronic door locks. When that didn't work, she turned the keys\nback the other way.\n\n\"That's when it started to move,\" Luca said.\n\nLuca watched as her brother backpedaled down the driveway and alongside the\nvan. She saw him pull open the driver's-side door and twist the wheel left and\nright, but quickly lost sight of him once the van moved toward the ditch.\n\n\"I saw him there ... it was just awful ... just awful,\" Reid said. \"It feels\nlike a dream. You expect to eventually lose people in your family, but not one\nof your younger brothers. Not like this.\"\n\nLane's family gathered Tuesday at his Blue Barns Road home to mourn. Until\nrain started to fall late in the afternoon, they had propped a homemade\nMother's Day collage of Jennifer Rowe's kids on the front steps. Lane is\npictured in the middle, sandwiched between Luca and Felix, his light-brown\nhair falling against his wire-rimmed glasses. He's smiling and holding up the\n\"you\" in collaborative sign that reads \"We love you very much.\"\n\n\"I see a lot of myself in Lane,\" said his father, Bob Rowe. \"He was funny. He\nwould dance. He would do anything to always make you laugh. He was just a\ngreat kid. He had a lot of promise.\"\n\nMore Information\n\n**Memorial**\n\nServices for Lane Rowe will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at Burnt Hills\nMethodist Church, 816 Route 50.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Lane Rowe Memorial Fund\nat any branch of the Ballston Spa National Bank or mailed to the bank at Box\n70, Ballston Spa, NY 12020.\n\n-\n\nRead More\n\nLane, who started middle school this year, was third oldest of five kids, born\non Sept. 12, 2001. He enjoyed spending time at his grandparents' home in the\nCatskills. He loved basketball and looked forward to one day sprouting as tall\nas Reid, who taught him his jump shot in the driveway. He cracked jokes that\nsometimes only made sense to him, was known to spontaneously break into a\ndance -- his energetic renditions Michael Jackson moves were well-known,\nLane's father said he loved music and wanted to play the flute. He watched\nover his younger sister and brother like a mother hen. He had just started\nsixth grade.\n\n\"Sometimes we'd fight or argue about stupid stuff,\" Reid said. \"And you look\nback on it now and wish you had never done it. You never know when someone's\ngoing to be gone.\"\n\nServices for Lane will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at Burnt Hills Methodist\nChurch. In the meantime, the kids are staying home from school and Jennifer\nRowe will be away from the nearby hair salon she runs. Everyone is still\nfiguring out what comes next. No one has slept much.\n\nBob Rowe thinks about times like this past summer, when he took Lane out to\nthe Cape Cod. They stayed in Dennis, a popular town that stretches from Cape\nCod Bay to the Atlantic. Every summer they would spend time collecting all the\nbottles they could find, deposit them, split the cash and splurge. This\nsummer, Lane spent it mostly on treats, like fudge. His father said the boy\ngave most of it away to his family.\n\n[bfitzgerald@timesunion.com](mailto:bfitzgerald@timesunion.com) \u2022 518-454-5414\n\u2022 @BFitzgeraldTU\n\n[Bryan Fitzgerald](http://www.timesunion.com/bryanfitzgerald/)\n\n  * [ ![](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/40/75/19271519/3/ratio1x1_100.jpg) ](https://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/289797/a-m-roundup-ny-suffers-highest-number-of-deaths-associated-with-covid-19/)\n\n[A.M.
