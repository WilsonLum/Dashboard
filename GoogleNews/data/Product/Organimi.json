Company\n\nWhen [Donald Trump](https://www.inc.com/alison-davis/what-donald-trump-doesnt-\nwant-you-to-know-about-leadership.html) and [Hillary\nClinton](https://www.inc.com/hillary-clinton/four-ways-to-jump-start-small-\nbusiness.html) emerged as the victors of last week's Super Tuesday polls, the\nnumber of Google searches for \"moving to Canada\" spiked considerably.\n\nSocial-media activity--including [Twitter users announcing their great\nmigration](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=news&q=%22move%20to%20canada%22%20since%3A2016-03-01%20until%3A2016-03-02&src=typd&lang=en)\\--was\ncentered on Trump's political ascendance. The prospect of his presidency has\nspooked liberal American voters into considering a move up North,\n[entrepreneurs included](https://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/canada-the-new-\nstart-up-frontier.html).\n\nThere are many things that make Canada an attractive place to live, like a\nuniversal health care policy and an array of government-funded education\nprograms. But startup founders looking to relocate or start a business in the\narea should note a number of caveats. Seed funding, for instance, isn't as\naccessible as it might be in Silicon Valley, New York City, and Boston.\n\nThe process of becoming a permanent resident of Canada could take a few years.\nIn some cases, you could operate a startup on a work visa, and apply for\nresidency later down the line. (You would still need to register your company\nas an \"extra-provincial corporation,\" and regulations vary depending on the\nregion.)\n\nC\u00e9dric Jeannot is a French national who immigrated to Canada from the U.S. to\nlaunch his cyber-security company, APrivacy. Prior to moving up north in 2010,\nhe attended the University of Louisville in Kentucky for a PhD in applied\nsecurity.\n\n\"I liked that Canada has the drive and mentality of the U.S., but it has a lot\nof the social sentiments of Europe,\" says Jeannot. He estimates that his\ncompany ran almost entirely on government grants on the order of \"hundreds of\nthousands of dollars\" for the first two years. While he was able to acquire a\nCanadian work visa within two months before launching APrivacy, it took two\nyears for Jeannot to become certified as a permanent resident.\n\nIf you're serious about moving to Canada, here are some important things\nyou'll find:\n\n## It's a comparatively small test market.\n\nCompanies that incorporate in Canada generally have a global scope, and\nfrequently set up offices in the U.S. While the Canadian market is small and\nhas fewer networking opportunities compared to Silicon Valley, it's still a\ngood place to try new products.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have launched beta products in Canada before entering\ninto the \"more important markets,\" noted Sunil Sharma, the managing director\nat Extreme Venture Partners, who is gearing up to launch a startup boot camp\nfor international entrepreneurs in Canada.\n\n## Favorable tax incentives.\n\nThe Canadian [SR&ED tax program](http://rd-\nreview.ca/eic/site/033.nsf/vwapj/4_Assessing_the_SRED_Tax_Credit-\neng.pdf/$FILE/4_Assessing_the_SRED_Tax_Credit-eng.pdf) lets founders get back\nmuch as 35 percent of what they spend on R&D costs, for a maximum threshold of\n$3 million.\n\n\"That kind of program does not exist anywhere in the U.S., and that's a huge\namount of money,\" said Brett Shellhammer, a former Silicon Valley tech worker\nand serial entrepreneur. Currently based in\n[Waterloo](https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/waterloo-startup-hot-spot.html), he\nrelocated to Canada while working for OpenText in 2005--just after George W.\nBush was reelected as U.S. president.\n\n\"I had a lot of friends who said, 'If Bush wins again, I'm moving to Canada,'\"\nhe recalls. \"I'm the only one who did it.\"\n\nFederal taxes will also subsidize many of the costs that U.S. citizens are\nused to paying out of pocket, such as health care and education.\n\n\"I couldn't have done what I did here in Silicon Valley because of two things:\nLabor costs and health care costs,\" Shellhammer added. His most successful\ncompany so far, called Organimi, tabulates organizational charts for third-\nparty businesses, and sees revenues under $100,000 annually.\n\n## Access to highly skilled tech talent, though it tends to migrate stateside.\n\nThe University of Waterloo has a widely recognized co-op program. It gives\nstudents two years of full-time work experience at any of 120 companies, some\nof which are located in Silicon Valley. As of 2012, an estimated one-third of\nWaterloo's graduating software engineers were offered jobs by U.S. companies.\n\n\"The University of Waterloo is among the top few universities Google recruits\nfrom around the world,\" said the school's Dean of Engineering, Pearl Sullivan,\nin an interview with _Bloomberg._\n\nThe stream of talent is a boon for tech entrepreneurs, but alas, many of those\nwould-be hires are taking the jobs stateside.\n\nShellhammer puts it in not so glib terms:\"It's fucking cold here. The guys who\ngraduate from Waterloo don't necessarily want to stay.\"\n\n## Starting can be tricky, but it's not impossible.\n\nLaunching your Canadian branch may present obstacles, but a new initiative\naimed specifically at international entrepreneurs may help to streamline the\nprocess.\n\nLaunched in 2013, the [Startup Visa program\n](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/business/start-up/)sets aside 2,750\nvisas annually to bring foreign startups to Canada. Along with the CEO, the\ngovernment will immigrate up to five co-founders from a single company on\npermanent residence, along with their families. The caveat: Your company must\nbe handpicked by a Canadian VC, incubator, or angel investor.\n\nSharma's Extreme Ventures Partners is one of 30 such funds that are licensed\nto bring startups to Canada (though he estimates that since 2013, fewer than\n100 of these visas have been allocated). He looks for companies with strong\nteams, a good product, perhaps a Kickstarter campaign, and some technical\nexpertise and patents. Strong sales and public traction are bonuses.  \n\n\"What's halting the program is a lack of involvement from the investors, but\nthere's definitely not a lack of interest from the entrepreneurs,\" notes\nSheetal Nanda, the founder and principal lawyer with Toronto-based SN Legal.\n\nNanda says that since last Tuesday, she's seen an uptick in call volume, from\nindividuals and business owners interested in immigrating to Canada. \"I was\nkind of taken aback,\" she said. \"But Canada is a wonderful place to live, so I\nunderstand all the interest.\"\n\nPublished on: Mar 7, 2016\n\nMore from

have released their \"organizational\nchart\", which is just another name for a depth chart, ahead of their week [one\nmatchup against the [Auburn\nTigers](/ncaaf/teams/auburn/)](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/oregon-\nducks/justin-herbert-and-bo-nix-could-be-disney-movie-pt-1-history) at AT&T\nStadium in Arlington, Texas this

Ducks expect tight ends [Jacob Breeland](/ncaaf/players/255241/) and\n[Cam McCormick](/ncaaf/players/263248/) to play. This is big news since the\ntwo [have battled through injuries this fall\ncamp](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/oregon-ducks/injury-updates-mario-\ncristobal-jacob-breeland-given-green-light-vs-auburn).\n\n\\- [Travis Dye](/ncaaf/players/287566/) will be a special teams monster. [The\nsophomore is sneaky fast and will be used all over the\nfield](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/oregon-ducks/oregon-running-back-\ntravis-dyes-spin-move-isnt-his-only-weapon). Having Dye and Jaylon Redd\nreturning kickoffs is a deadly, speedy combo.\n\n- Isaac Slade-Matautia won starting ILB position, officially. The sophomore is ready to take on a [much bigger role this season](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/oregon-ducks/oregon-duck-x-factor-isaac-slade-matautia-emulating-marcus-mariota) after playing just seven games last year.\n\n\\- Will freshman [Kayvon Thibodeaux](/ncaaf/players/299118/) start? The 2019\nESPN No. 1 recruit is talented, no doubt about that, but according to the\nchart, Gus Cumberlander will start at DE.\n\n\\- Senior Bryson Young is the STUD, [an important position in DC Andy Avalos'\ndefensive system](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/video/oregon-dc-andy-\navalos-focused-developing-studs-defense).\n\n\\- A LOT of true freshman in the defensive two-deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n

PM UTC\n\n![A huge offseason spending spree netted only a one-game improvement for the\nPhillies in 2019, prompting the end of Gabe Kapler's\nreign.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gunFd7Wn.bomiqe_ldXLjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTM2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hMGQdijrQiVf1nfCcUY_Aw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-\nGB/homerun/omnisport.uk/6c82a0d031eb0fa88c82c39b57504ac0)\n\nA huge offseason spending spree netted only a one-game improvement for the\nPhillies in 2019, prompting the end of Gabe Kapler's reign.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies have fired manager Gabe Kapler after a second\nsuccessive mediocre season.\n\nThe Phillies had high expectations for 2019 after loading up in the offseason,\nbut their roster moves only led to a one-game improvement from the previous\ncampaign.\n\nConsequently, the team, who concluded an 81-81 season 11 days ago, announced\non Thursday that Kapler would not return for the final year of his contract.\n\n __\n\n\"Several years ago, I promised our loyal fans that I would do everything in my\npower to bring a world championships team to our city,\" owner John Middleton\nsaid in a  statement.\n\n\"During the second half of this season and continuing into this week, I have\nevaluated our organisation extensively, a process that included talking to\nmany people both internally and around the league.\n\n\"Reassuring to me was the endorsement that people outside the Phillies gave to\nthe progress we have made recently, both organisationally and on the field.\n\n\"Nevertheless, with the knowledge that I have gained from my evaluation,\ncombined with my personal reflection on the 2019 season, I have decided that\nsome changes are necessary to achieve our ultimate objective.\n\n\"Consequently, we will replace our manager. I am indebted to Gabe for the\nsteadfast effort, energy and enthusiasm that he brought to our club, and we\nare unquestionably a better team and organisation as a result of his\ncontributions.\"\n\nThat Philadelphia posted the one-game improvement from Kapler's first year at\nthe helm was a significant disappointment after bringing in Bryce Harper, J.T.\nRealmuto, Andrew McCutchen, Jean Segura and David Robertson.\n\nThose additions bumped the opening day payroll up $45million from 2018, but\nthe Phillies missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive year.\n\nThat was enough for Middleton to make the move, and now he will look for a\nmanager who can vault the Phillies back into regular postseason contention.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We came into 2019 with very high hopes. We fell short of those, and that\nresponsibility lies with me,\" Kapler said in a release.\n\n\"The next Phillies manager will inherit a team of talented, dedicated and\ncommitted players. There has been nothing more fulfilling in my professional\ncareer than the opportunity to work with the players on this team. I will\nforever value the relationships I developed with them.\n\n\"As I move on, I know that this organisation is in a great spot and will see a\nlot of success going forward. My hope is that I helped contribute to a\ndeveloping culture in the organisation that flourishes in the years to come.\n\n\"I've come to care for this franchise and have the best wishes for this group\nin the future. The passion and devotion of the Phillies fan base both inspired\nand humbled me daily.\n\n\"It was an honour to grow, develop and learn with this team. I'm looking\nforward to what the future brings, and I know I'm a better leader and person\nfor having had this opportunity.\"\n\n## What to Read Next\n\n **Back**\n\n[ Sign in](https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.intl=us&.lang=en-\nUS&.src=sports&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fgabe-kapler-phillies-\nmanager-two-155216021.html)\n\n* Sports Home\n\n  * [Coronavirus](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus \"Coronavirus\")\n  * [#WeKeepPlaying](https://sports.yahoo.com/billie-jean-king-sabrina-ionescu-wekeepplaying-womens-sports-140031515.html \"#WeKeepPlaying\")\n  * Fantasy\n\n  * NFL\n\n  * NBA\n\n  * MLB\n\n  * NHL\n\n  * Soccer\n\n  * Sportsbook\n\n  * NCAAF\n\n  * Videos\n\n  * Podcasts\n\n  * NCAAB\n\n  * Tennis\n\n  * Golf\n\n  * NASCAR\n\n  * MMA\n\n  * XFL\n\n  * Boxing\n\n  * [Cricket](https://cricket.yahoo.net/ \"Cricket\")\n  * WNBA\n\n  * NCAAW\n\n  * [Indycar](https://sports.yahoo.com/indycar/ \"Indycar\")\n  * Motorsports\n\n  * Horse Racing\n\n  * [Cycling](https://sports.yahoo.com/cycling/ \"Cycling\")\n  * [Rivals](https://www.rivals.com/ \"Rivals\")\n  * [Shop](https://shop.yahoosports.com/nfl-football/o-4683+z-7143711-2463536120?_s=bm-navrail \"Shop\")\n  * [Help](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&page=product&y=PROD_SPORTS_SPNEWS \"Help\")\n  * [Jobs](http://sports.yahoo.com/jobs \"Jobs\")\n  * [RSS](https://sports.yahoo.com/syndication/ \"RSS\")\n  * [Tickets](https://seatgeek.com/?aid=14&pid=ys_web_navbar \"Tickets\")\n\n  * Yahoo Sites\n  * [Home](https://www.yahoo.com/ \"Home\")\n  * [Mail](https://mail.yahoo.com/?.intl=us&.lang=en-US \"Mail\")\n  * [Search](https://search.yahoo.com/search/ \"Search\")\n  * [News](https://news.yahoo.com/ \"News\")\n  * [Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/ \"Finance\")\n  * [Entertainment](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ \"Entertainment\")\n  * [Lifestyle](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ \"Lifestyle\")\n  * [Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/ \"Sports\")\n  * [Fantasy Sports](http://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/ \"Fantasy Sports\")\n  * [Weather](https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/ \"Weather\")\n  * [Tech](https://finance.yahoo.com/tech/ \"Tech\")\n  * [Shopping](https://shopping.yahoo.com/ \"Shopping\")\n  * [Answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/ \"Answers\")\n  * [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/ \"Tumblr\")\n\n  * Tools\n  * [Help](https://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/helpcentral/ \"Help\")\n  * [Account Info](https://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile?.intl=us&.lang=en-US&.src=all \"Account Info\")\n  * [Careers](https://careers.yahoo.com/us/ \"Careers\")\n  * [About](https://www.verizonmedia.com/ \"About\")\n\n  \n[Terms\n(Updated)](https://www.verizonmedia.com/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/terms/otos/index.html)\n& [Privacy\n(Updated)](https://www.verizonmedia.com/policies/xw/en/verizonmedia/privacy/intl/index.html)\n\n **** ****\n\n"}, {"item": "Startup Canada Podcast: Aluvion Law founder Eric Apps on disrupting age-old industries -

This is a common question asked by\nentrepreneurs looking to power the next tsunami of change. Eric Apps is making\nwaves in the field of law by using his experiences as an entrepreneur to\ninnovate.\n\n\u201cAs an entrepreneur, disrupting an industry doesn\u2019t mean getting into a fight\nor competing at a higher level, but it entails knowing who you want to\ndisrupt, how you are going to go about it, and how you are going to get money\nout of it,\u201d said Apps.\n\nApps is a Toronto-based serial entrepreneur on a mission.

Costner in talks to join Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba in 'Molly's\nGame'\n\nMore\n\nOscar-winning actor Kevin Costner looks set to join Jessica Chastain and Idris\nElba in Aaron Sorkin's \"Molly's Game\" reports\n[Deadline](http://deadline.com/2016/10/kevin-costner-cast-mollys-game-aaron-\nsorkin-jessica-chastain-1201837710/).\n\nChastain is already confirmed to be playing the movie's title character Molly\nBloom, with Costner currently in talks for the role of Bloom's father.\n\nThe film, which has been adapted from Bloom's memoir by Sorkin, will tell the\ntrue story of the Olympic-class skier, who ran the world's most exclusive\nhigh-stakes poker game for a decade before being arrested in the middle of the\nnight by the FBI.\n\nHollywood royalty, sports stars, and business moguls all played at Bloom's\npoker games, but unbeknownst to her, also the Russian mob.\n\nBritish actor Elba is set to play Bloom's lawyer and only ally, who learns\nthat there's much more to Bloom than what is reported in the tabloids.\n\nCostner can next be seen in \"Hidden Figures\" alongside Octavia Spencer and\nKirsten Dunst, set to be released on Christmas Day.\n\n[Reblog](https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FbZCvxr.6NdAQn79AX_fPUw--~B%2FaD0zNjAwO3c9MjM1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen_US%2FNews%2FUS-\nAFPRelax%2F000_was8294339.67821103906.original.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fkevin-\ncostner-talks-join-jessica-chastain-idris-\nelba-084546979.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fkevin-\ncostner-talks-join-jessica-chastain-idris-\nelba-084546979.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&caption=Oscar-\nwinning%20actor%20Kevin%20Costner%20looks%20set%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20Aaron%20Sorkin's%20%22Molly's%20Game%22%20reports%20Deadline.%20%20Chastain%20is%20already%20confirmed%20to%20be%20playing%20the%20movie's%20title%20character%20Molly%20Bloom%2C%20with%20Costner%20currently%20in%20talks%20for%20the%20role%20of%20Bloom'&tags=)[Share](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=458584288257241&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fkevin-\ncostner-talks-join-jessica-chastain-idris-\nelba-084546979.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dfb&name=Kevin%20Costner%20in%20talks%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20'Molly's%20Game'&description=Oscar-\nwinning%20actor%20Kevin%20Costner%20looks%20set%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20Aaron%20Sorkin's%20%22Molly's%20Game%22%20reports%20Deadline.%20%20Chastain%20is%20already%20confirmed%20to%20be%20playing%20the%20movie's%20title%20character%20Molly%20Bloom%2C%20with%20Costner%20currently%20in%20talks%20for%20the%20role%20of%20Bloom'&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FbZCvxr.6NdAQn79AX_fPUw--~B%2FaD0zNjAwO3c9MjM1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen_US%2FNews%2FUS-\nAFPRelax%2F000_was8294339.67821103906.original.jpg&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fmediacontentsharebuttons%2Fpostshare%2F&display=popup&show_error=yes)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kevin%20Costner%20in%20talks%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20'Molly's%20Game'&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fkevin-\ncostner-talks-join-jessica-chastain-idris-\nelba-084546979.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dtw&via=YahooNews)[Share](mailto:?subject=Kevin%20Costner%20in%20talks%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20'Molly's%20Game'&body=Kevin%20Costner%20in%20talks%20to%20join%20Jessica%20Chastain%20and%20Idris%20Elba%20in%20'Molly's%20Game'%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fkevin-\ncostner-talks-join-jessica-chastain-idris-\nelba-084546979.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dma)\n\n##

Sort of\nlike staring at the sun after squirting alcohol into your eyes, [the club's\nofficial website](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/detail/article/orange-and-\nyellow-change-strip) describes it as \"a veritable array of vibrant colors to\ncelebrate the team's dazzling football.\"\n\nIt continues:\n\n __\n\n> The FC Barcelona change strip for the 2012/13 season merges orange and\n> yellow in honour of the city's culture, art, style and architecture. It has\n> a classic orange collar with the famous Bar\u00e7a colours on the nape and\n> sleeves. The back of the shirt also features the Catalan flag, and the 'More\n> Than a Club' slogan on the inside of the collar, written in a typeface was\n> specially chosen to reflect Catalan architecture.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard a bright orange collar described as \"classic\"\nbefore, but if orange and yellow are accurate reflections on the city's\nculture, art, style and architecture then, clearly, the entire city is on\nfire.
