These bar charts display progress horizontally as a simple\nguide to what needs to happen when, and who will do it. When a director or a\nproject manager creates a Gantt chart, they can set expectations for and\ncourse-correct a project's direction, fill in details and compare priorities.\n\nA [Gantt chart](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Gantt-\nchart) neatly encapsulates a project with limited scope. Some teams use Gantt\ncharts for large-scale projects, such as a DevOps transformation -- but they\ntell an incomplete story. Let's get into the good, the bad and the ugly of\nGantt charts.\n\n### __Gantt chart benefits\n\nAn elementary Gantt chart fails to define some important project details, but\nit does provide organizations with certain benefits. Here are four reasons why\na Gantt chart is beneficial for a large-scale project.\n\n**Create a vision for your project.** A Gantt chart conveys the project's\nroadmap in one look, as well as the who, what, when and how of the work.\n\nA Gantt chart can convey tasks with their related deadlines -- all to help\nachieve important business goals. A vision and roadmap for this project should\n[run across teams](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-\nmake-distributed-Agile-teams-efficient-and-collaborative) \\-- maybe even\ndepartments. The Gantt chart user should immediately know whether a phase,\nsuch as Phase III in the DevOps transformation project example, is incomplete.\n\n**Balance priorities**. Gantt charts help teams figure out to how juggle\nmultiple items, without missing due dates. The organization might find Gantt\ncharts useful to predict [the number of\nsprints](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/Embrace-these-Agile-\nsprint-planning-tenets) necessary to accomplish development and infrastructure\nwork.\n\nEven one day late on a deliverable can drastically reshape a large-scale\nproject. Gantt charts help a team visualize the consequences of [work that's\nlate](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-manage-delays-when-doing-software-\nprojects). They facilitate conversations about priorities and deadlines.\n\nTime spent on one area means less time for another -- it requires balance to\nsucceed. Place Gantt charts on the wall to spark open and organic conversation\nabout the project, rather than scrambling to address problems late with the\nwrong resources.\n\n**Find what's missing from the vision**. It's hard to create a Gantt chart for\nlarge, multi-faceted projects. Software testers, architects, programmers and\nother IT professionals will find many items missing from a simple Gantt chart.\nRely on these specialists to identify and implement more thorough plans.\n\n**Enforce team direction.** A good Gantt chart provides a coherent plan. But\neven a terrible Gantt chart forces conversations that clarify roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\nA few years ago, I consulted with a company that championed adoption of\ncontinuous delivery, but it lacked a fleshed-out plan. When I interviewed\nmembers of the architecture group, they said it wasn't realistic to expect to\nfit API or enterprise service bus tools in Docker container components. When I\nasked what they would have in 18 months, the software architects said, \"We'll\nhave to see what the dev teams do,\" and shrugged their shoulders.\n\nThe higher-ups demoted that group's director within a month. A Gantt chart\nmight have forced that architecture group to be proactive with their work,\ninstead of reactive.\n\n### __What a Gantt chart won't show you\n\nThe purpose of a Gantt chart is to provide a high-level view of how and when\nwork must get done. But that strength is also its weakness, as it leaves a lot\nup to interpretation and opens the door for delay.\n\nLet's say an organization wants to [embark on a DevOps\ninitiative](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/podcast/Prioritize-\nDevOps-and-Agile-outcomes-not-transformation) to modernize its large,\nmonolithic web apps. The organization might find Gantt charts useful to\norganize multiple teams and departments, as well as set goals and deadlines.\nBut a project with that large of a scope is difficult to chart -- take the\nexample of this DevOps transformation:\n\n__An organization's Gantt chart for a DevOps transformation.\n\n__\n\nWhile a Gantt chart is designed to give a rough outline of the project\nschedule, it often over-simplifies the work to be done. If a Gantt chart is\nthe sole visualization of a team's projected work, expect the project to stray\nfrom the plan. Labels, like **CD pipeline** , probably aren't well defined.\nMeanwhile, the feature-focused dev teams will likely prioritize work with\nclearer expectations or sooner deadlines -- or they might wait for\narchitecture work on **Components** or **Independent deploy APIs** to be\ncompleted. Meanwhile, as teams quibble over this mess of dependencies between\ntheir tasks, QA engineers will [laugh and turn\naway](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-keep-developers-\nand-testers-happy-and-productive) from the all the finger-pointing.\n\nThus, Gantt charts alone do a poor job of visualizing work in progress for\nlarge projects. Instead, consider the purpose of a Gantt chart to be a simple\ntimeline that is easy for anyone in the business to read.\n\n### __How PERT charts, Kanban clarify workflows\n\nPERT stands for Program Evaluation and Review Technique. Unlike Gantt charts,\nPERT charts clearly identify dependencies between components of the overall\nproject.\n\nA [PERT chart](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/PERT-\nchart) shows dependencies, such as whether a development team must fully\ncomplete a task before an architecture team can start on its own task. PERT\ncharts connect deliverables with arrows between each other, making work\nrelationships apparent.\n\nBecause a PERT chart clarifies which department depends on another, it can\nprevent some finger-pointing about missed deadlines. All teams understand\nwhere their responsibilities lie in a massive organizational undertaking. If a\nmisunderstanding arises, a PERT chart prompts a conversation at the\nappropriate level. The PERT chart also helps management understand [the\ncritical path](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/critical-path-method-\nCPM) \\-- which groups are at risk for project delays at a given time.\n\nScrum and the Scaled Agile Framework recommend that organizations use a\n[Kanban](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/kanban) board as a\nvisualization of work at the team level. The physical visualization of Kanban\nboards involves cards -- usually in the form of sticky notes -- that detail\ntasks, advancing left to right through different stages of a workflow as they\nnear completion.\n\nUnlike a Gantt chart, Kanban boards are designed to evolve with a project,\nenabling some work items to move or be expedited in favor of others. To\nvisualize dependencies in a Kanban board, a team can stack cards on top of one\nanother, or detail sub-tasks for each card. However, Kanban boards often fail\nto visualize strict deadlines, which makes each type of project planning chart\nuseful for different purposes.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Software project management\n\n  * [\n\n##### Project management tools and strategies: Gantt charts, PERT charts and\nPM planning tools\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/courtemanche_meredith_2.jpg)\nBy: Meredith Courtemanche\n](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tutorial/Project-management-\ntools-and-strategies-Gantt-charts-PERT-charts-and-PM-planning-tools)\n\n  * [\n\n##### PERT chart (Program Evaluation Review Technique)\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse ](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/PERT-\nchart)\n\n  * [\n\n##### A tour through the PPM software marketplace\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/violino_bob.jpg) By: Bob\nViolino ](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/A-tour-through-the-PPM-\nsoftware-marketplace)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Top 10 UCaaS providers ranked in industry report\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/finnell_katherine.jpg) By:\nKatherine Finnell\n](https://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/news/450296338/Top-10-UCaaS-\nproviders-ranked-in-industry-report)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [Keeping Up the Pace of Transformation to Ensure Your Organization Stays on Top](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/Keeping-Up-the-Pace-of-Transformation-to-Ensure-Your-Organization-Stays-on-Top) -Citrix\n  * [Adopt, implement and realize the full potential of AI](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/ModernizingDataStorage/Adopt-implement-and-realize-the-full-potential-of-AI) -IBM\n  * [Adopt, implement and realize the full potential of AI](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/ModernizeDataStorage/Adopt-implement-and-realize-the-full-potential-of-AI) -IBM\n  * [See More](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Project management tools and strategies: Gantt charts...](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tutorial/Project-management-tools-and-strategies-Gantt-charts-PERT-charts-and-PM-planning-tools) - SearchSoftwareQuality\n  * [PERT chart (Program Evaluation Review Technique)](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/PERT-chart) - SearchSoftwareQuality\n  * [Project management charts: Beyond Gantt](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/answer/Project-management-charts-Beyond-Gantt) - SearchSoftwareQuality\n\n####  __Start the conversation\n\n###  __ 0 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

In 2017, international guidelines for early detection of CP were\npublished on the basis of a systematic review of evidence. Our study aim was\nto reduce the age at CP diagnosis throughout a network of 5 diverse US high-\nrisk infant follow-up programs through consistent implementation of these\nguidelines.\n\n **METHODS:** The study leveraged plan-do-study-act and Lean methodologies.\nThe primary outcome was age at CP diagnosis. Data were acquired during the\ncorresponding 9-month baseline and quarterly throughout study. Balancing\nmeasures were clinic no-show rates and parent perception of the diagnosis\nvisit. Clinic teams conducted strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and\nthreats analyses, process flow evaluations, standardized assessments training,\nand parent questionnaires. Performance of a 3- to 4-month clinic visit was a\ncritical process step because it included a Hammersmith Infant Neurologic\nExamination, a General Movements Assessment, and standardized assessments of\nmotor function.\n\n **RESULTS:** The age at CP diagnosis decreased from a weighted average of\n19.5 (95% confidence interval 16.2 to 22.8) to 9.5 months (95% confidence\ninterval 4.5 to 14.6), with _P_ = .008; 3- to 4-month visits per site\nincreased from the median (interquartile range) 14 (5.2\u201373.7) to 54\n(34.5\u2013152.0), with _P_ < .001; and no-show rates were not different. Parent\nquestionnaires revealed positive provider perception with improvement\nopportunities for information content and understandability.\n\n **CONCLUSIONS:** Large-scale implementation of international guidelines for\nearly detection of CP is feasible in diverse high-risk infant follow-up\nclinics. The initiative was received positively by families and without\nadversely affecting clinic operational flow. Additional parent support and\neducation are necessary.\n\n  * Accepted January 13, 2020.\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics\n\n[View Full\nText](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/04/07/peds.2019-2126.full)\n\n### Log in using your username and password\n\nUsername *\n\nPassword *\n\n[Forgot](https://shop.aap.org/account/forgot-password/) your user name or\npassword?\n\n### Log in through your institution\n\nYou may be able to gain access using your login credentials for your\ninstitution.

obvious reasons. Of course in a lockdown there is not a lot\nof demand for staffing. The probability of many other businesses closing down\nafter the lockdown is lifted is high, so there could be an increase in amount\nof people looking for work. That will also hurt a name like MAN. But is it a\ngood time to look at this name as a play for the long haul?\n\n**Description**\n\nManpowerGroup Inc. provides workforce solutions and services in the Americas,\nSouthern Europe, Northern Europe, and the Asia Pacific Middle East region. The\ncompany offers recruitment services, including permanent, temporary, and\ncontract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and\nindustrial positions under the Manpower and Experis brands. It also offers\nvarious assessment services; training and development services; career\nmanagement; and outsourcing services related to human resources functions\nprimarily in the areas of large-scale recruiting and workforce-intensive\ninitiatives. In addition, the company provides workforce consulting services;\ncontingent staffing and permanent recruitment services; professional\nresourcing and project-based solutions in information technology, engineering,\nand finance fields; solutions in the areas of organizational efficiency,\nindividual development, and career mobility; and recruitment process\noutsourcing, TAPFIN managed, and talent based outsourcing services, as well as\nProservia services in the areas of digital services market and IT\ninfrastructure sector. It operates through a network of approximately 2,500\noffices in 75 countries and territories. The company was founded in 1948 and\nis headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n**Earnings History**\n\nI see a good earnings history for MAN. Three out of the last four quarter were\nbeats and the lone miss was just of a penny.\n\nOver the last four quarters MAN has posted a positive earnings surprise of\n2.7%.\n\n**Earnings Estimates**\n\nThe Zacks Rank really keys on the movement of earnings estimates. For MAN, the\nestimates are falling. This year moved from $7.63 down to $5.14 and next year\nhas declined from $8.26 to $6.97.\n\nThat sort of negative revision will send a stock lower... but why would the\nnumbers for 2021 fall so much?\n\nI believe that the COVID 19 crisis will come to an end in the next few\nmonths... not next year. More over, the gap of closed businesses will allow\nseveral new ones to open and existing names to close the market share gap in\nshort order. So will there be less demand for staffing in 2021 -- the analysts\nsure think so, but I think the stock recovers with the economy.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nA 10x forward earnings multiple is actually a little high for a stock that is\nseeing revenue contract at a 3.65% rate. That said, the 1.2x book multiple is\nvery low and margins are still positive.\n\nThis is certainly a stock worth taking a deeper look at as the COVID crisis\nwill not last forever.\n\n**Chart**\n\n### ManpowerGroup Inc.

[Join BI\nPrime](/subscription/prime?r=readmode) and start reading now.\n\n  * **As the coronavirus crisis forces people to work remotely, tools that help them stay connected and productive are booming in popularity.**\n  *  **We asked a select group of VCs to name enterprise startups that could take off this year as a result of the changing work environment.**\n  * Each investor named two \"future of work\" startups: one in their portfolio, and one company they admire but have no financial interest in.\n  * [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet).\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has changed not only where people work from, but how\nthey work and what tools they use.\n\nAlready, apps like [Zoom](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-filing-impact-\ncoronavirus-eric-yuan-2020-3) and\n[Slack](https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-7000-new-paid-customers-since-\nfebruary-coronavirus-2020-3) have seen huge increases in usage in the past few\nweeks, as users grab onto ways to stay connected in their work and personal\nlives while social distancing.\n\nThe urgent need for better work tools could catapult some enterprise startups\ninto the pantheon of unicorn startups, as their users multiply and venture\ncapital investors jump to fund them.\n\nWe wanted to find the startups that are already transforming the future of\nwork, defining the new ways in which people are doing their everyday jobs. We\nreached out to a select group of venture capitalists with enterprise bets in\ntheir portfolios and asked them to name the startups that are positioned to\nhave very good years.\n\nWhen we spoke to each investor, we set some ground rules for participation:\n\n  1. The VC had to tell us about one startup in their portfolio. After all, they had enough conviction in the company to write it a check.\n  2. We also asked them to name one \"future of work\" startup where they have no financial interest. Those are the companies they're closely watching, maybe with a bit of envy.\n\nTheir nominations cover all aspects of work, from processes like recruiting\nand onboarding to products such as video conferencing, chatbots, and email.\n\n **Here are the 30 startups they named, listed in alphabetical order:**\n\n## Airtable: A smart spreadsheet app with a cult following in tech\n\n![Howie Liu](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5bc60204df918d124e4bbba8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nHowie Liu is the cofounder and CEO of Airtable.

It works just as well\nas a personal note-taking app, as well as a central repository of information\nfor teams,\" de Rycker said.\n\n\"It's no surprise that they hit 1 million users in less than three years -- a\nbeautiful example of product-led growth, as the company was bootstrapped until\nrecently,\" de Rycker said. \"They seem to make their way into companies before\nthey realize, as employees just sign up with corporate credit cards, and\nbefore they know it, everyone is hooked.\"\n\nNotion just raised [$50 million in new funding in a round led by Index\nVentures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/technology/notion-startup-fund-\nraising.html) that valued it at $2 billion.\n\n## Outreach: Sales engagement software\n\n![Manny Medina](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5de8349afd9db208e57271f8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nManny Medina is the cofounder and CEO of Outreach.

First, he said that most midsize and large companies are\nseeing \"massive tailwinds\" for outbound and targeted efforts to make new\nsales.\n\n\"Second, Outreach is the first system of action and engagement that allows end\nusers, like sales reps and customer success reps, to scale themselves and do\nbetter work, as opposed to competing products that report activities to\nmanagement. It truly is the operating system for sales, which in turn, is the\ngrowth driver of the economy,\" he said.\n\nMehandru said he's also excited by the team at Outreach, which has scaled\nrevenue from single digit millions to more than $100 million in the last four\nyears.\n\n\"In 2020, as enterprises brace for a new normal where travel is curbed and\nsales reps can't get on airplanes, Outreach is a shoe-in for a product that\nallows salespeople to continue their activities, automate their daily\nactivities, and continue delivering value to prospects and customers\nworldwide,\" he said.\n\n## Overview: A smart camera that detects defects in machinery\n\n![overview austin appel chris van dyke russell\nnibbelink](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5e8495d1671de07936397b37?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\n\nAustin Appel, left; Chris Van Dyke, center; and Russell Nibbelink are the\ncofounders of Overview.

Poised to Scale\n\nby

is always an emphasis placed on building the right team in the startup\nworld and much attention is devoted to attracting and retaining the right\ntalent. Yet there are few resources to help you manage what happens when\ninternal systems and operations cannot match the scale of growth for a\nflourishing business. ChartHop is the organizational management platform\nhelping companies scale through organizational charts that build and updates\nthemselves. ChartHop's solution gives employees insight into the\norganizational structure of the company and is also ideal for HR Teams that\nneed to analyze components that include departmental costs, employees by\nlocation, gender breakdown, and diversity in management. ChartHop is currently\nused by companies such as Figma, BetterCloud, and TodayTix.\n\n**AlleyWatch** sat down with CEO and CTO **Ian White** to learn more about how\nhis experience scaling Sailthru led to founding ChartHop, the fundraising\nprocess with a newborn, the company's expansion plans, and recent found of\nfunding from a number of leading East Coast and West Coast investors.\n\n**Who were your investors and how much did you raise?**\n\nWe raised $5M in Seed funding led by **Andreessen Horowitz** (a16z).\n**Abstract Ventures** , the a16z Cultural Leadership Fund, **CoFound** ,\n**Cowboy Ventures** , **Flybridge Capital** , **Shrug Capital** , **Work Life\nVentures** , as well as prominent startup founders and C-level executives\nparticipated in the round.\n\n**Tell us about the product or service that ChartHop offers.**\n\nChartHop is the world\u2019s first organizational management platform built to help\ncompanies scale. The platform automatically builds fluid, data-driven views of\na company through real-time updated org charts, custom reporting, and\nheadcount planning tools that boost efficiency and transparency across teams.\n\n**[![](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Ian_White_ChartHop_rev-300x300.jpg)](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Ian_White_ChartHop_rev.jpg)What inspired the start of\nChartHop?**\n\nBefore founding ChartHop, I was the cofounder of Sailthru and the first head\nof engineering at Business Insider. At both organizations, I saw first-hand\nthe challenges in understanding and planning for our organization. When we\nreached 50 people at Sailthru, our early processes started to break down, and\nwe needed to set up a robust team structure yet couldn\u2019t find a good tool to\ndo so.\n\nI've always been inspired by great software that gets the little details\nright, that reimagines what's possible, and expands our capabilities to\ncollaborate and create. Through my experiences, I saw that this type of\nsoftware didn't exist for understanding and managing people \u2013 despite the fact\nthat people are an organization\u2019s most valuable resource. That\u2019s what inspired\nme to build ChartHop and fill the obvious void in organizational management\nthat many organizations face.\n\n**How is ChartHop different?**\n\nThere truly isn\u2019t another platform that provides a comprehensive view of an\norganization the way ChartHop does. Through automatic integrations with\ncustomers\u2019 existing systems (ChartHop supports over 20 integrations, such as\nADP, Workday, and more), organizations can structure and analyze People data\nin real-time by multiple factors, including location, salary, stock grants,\nnumber of direct reports, gender, and more.\n\n**What market does ChartHop target and how big is it?**\n\nOur market is really any company looking for a better way to run and scale. We\nwork with organizations that range from 100 to thousands of employees in the\nU.S. and globally. While the head of HR is a primary user amongst our early\ncustomers, we\u2019re solving a problem that goes beyond HR \u2014 it\u2019s for any\nexecutive, leader or manager in any organization that\u2019s growing and needs to\nplan the organization in a more informed, strategic way.\n\n[![](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/ChartHop_Ian_White.001.jpeg)](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/ChartHop_Ian_White.001.jpeg)\n\n**Who do you consider to be your main competitors?**\n\nSpreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations are our true competitors \u2014 leaders\nhave been using these to layout and plan their organizations for decades.\n\n**What\u2019s your business model?**\n\nChartHop is a SaaS per employee subscription model.\n\n**What was the funding process like?**\n\nI deliberately spent two years building, rolling out the platform to beta\ncustomers, and getting customer feedback before raising. I wasn\u2019t looking to\nraise right away, but the product momentum reached a tipping point where it\njust made sense to get ahead of things and hire a team.\n\nUltimately, we raised on the basis of having a fully built-out product and a\nlot of customer traction.\n\nThe fundraising process was much more about demoing the platform rather than\npresenting slides and pitching a product I might decide to build.\n\nThe partner I was introduced to at Andreessen Horowitz, **David Ulevitch** ,\nhas deep technical-founder operational experience. David really shared his\nconviction from the first demo, and we got to know each other and build a lot\nof trust in the working relationship before going forward. The shared\nconviction of the a16z talent team and the other enterprise partners \u2013 over\nthe course of more demos \u2013 was important. Altogether, the process took a few\nmonths. Also, my son Ace was born during that period, so it was a busy time\nfor me!\n\n> The shared conviction of the a16z talent team and the other enterprise\n> partners \u2013 over the course of more demos \u2013 was important.

Also, my son Ace was born during that period, so\n> it was a busy time for me!\n\n**What are the biggest challenges that you faced while raising capital?**\n\nGiven there are so many fantastic seed funds, micro funds, and angels (who can\nadd tremendous value), it was important, and tough, to find the right balance\nof investors. a16z was the right partner and very supportive in that process.\nWe were oversubscribed and had to make tough decisions, but in the end, we\nwere fortunate enough to bring on an excellent group of investors. It\u2019s great\nto be excited about the people you\u2019re working with.\n\n**What factors about your business led your investors to write the check?**\n\nWe can\u2019t speak on behalf of our investors, but [this blog\npost](https://a16z.com/2020/02/20/investing-in-charthop/) by David Ulevitch at\nAndreessen Horowitz describes in detail why he invested in us.\n\n**What are the milestones you plan to achieve in the next six months?**\n\nOur priorities right now are bringing the product to market, growing our team,\nand continuing to build-out the platform functionality.\n\n**What advice can you offer companies in New York that do not have a fresh\ninjection of capital in the bank?**\n\nBuild a product that people want, talk to customers, build more product\nfunctionality, talk to customers some more, repeat. Funding is just a tool.\nThe most important thing is a relentless focus on solving customer problems.\nGet that right, and a lot of other things will take care of themselves.\n\n**What\u2019s your favorite restaurant in the city?**\n\nLilia in my neighborhood in Williamsburg is consistently awesome Italian \u2014 get\nthe Rigatoni Diavola.\n\n[PREVIOUS POST](https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/02/paige-ai-cancer-diagnosis-\ntreatment-carla-leibowitz/)[NEXT POST](https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/02/the-\nweekly-notable-startup-funding-report-2-24-20/)\n\nFiled Under:\n[#NYCTech](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/alleytalk/nyctech/),\n[AlleyTalk](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/alleytalk/),\n[Angel/Seed](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/funding/angel/), [Funded in\nthe Alley](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/funding/funded-in-the-alley/),\n[Funded in the Alley](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/startups/funded-in-\nthe-alley-startups/), [Funding](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/funding/),\n[Funding News](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/funding/funding-news/),\n[HR](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/business/hr/),\n[Interviews](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/alleytalk/interviews/),\n[Startups](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/startups/) Tagged With:\n[Abstract Ventures](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/abstract-ventures/),\n[Andreessen Horowitz](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/andreessen-horowitz/),\n[ChartHop](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/charthop/),\n[CoFound](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/cofound/), [Cowboy\nVentures](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/cowboy-ventures/), [Flybridge\nCapital](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/flybridge-capital/), [Ian\nWhite](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/ian-white/), [Shrug\nCapital](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/shrug-capital/), [Work Life\nVentures](https://www.alleywatch.com/tag/work-life-ventures/)\n\n## Primary Sidebar\n\n## Footer\n\n### ABOUT ALLEYWATCH\n\n[ABOUT US](https://www.alleywatch.com/about-us/)  \n[ADVERTISE](https://advertising.alleywatch.com)  \n[EDITORIAL GUIDELINES](https://www.alleywatch.com/alleywatch-editorial-\nguidelines/)  \n[LEGAL](https://www.alleywatch.com/legal/)  \n[PRIVACY](https://www.alleywatch.com/privacy-policy/)  \n[TERMS OF USE](https://www.alleywatch.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n\n### CONTACT\n\n[CONTACT US](https://www.alleywatch.com/contact-us/)  \n[ADVERTISE](http://advertising.alleywatch.com/)  \n[TIPS](mailto:tips@alleywatch.com)  \n[WRITE FOR US](https://www.alleywatch.com/guest)\n\n### CHANNELS\n\n[NYC VC](https://www.alleywatch.com/vc/)  \n[NYC TECH EVENTS](http://events.alleywatch.com/nyc-tech-startup-events/)  \n[NYC TECH NEWS](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/alleytalk/)  \n[NYC STARTUPS](https://www.alleywatch.com/category/startups/)  \n[NYC COWORKING](https://www.alleywatch.com/2014/01/the-complete-guide-to-\ncoworking-in-nyc/)  \n[TECH DIRECTORY](https://www.alleywatch.com/alleywatch-tech-directory/)\n\n### Social\n\n[FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/alleywatch)  \n[TWITTER](https://www.twitter.com/alleywatch)  \n[LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alleywatch)  \n[INSTAGRAM](https://instagram.com/alleywatch)\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n## Footer Credentials Area\n\n(C) 2020 \u00b7 [AlleyWatch](https://www.alleywatch.com) \u00b7 All Rights Reserved \u00b7\nProudly made for NYC[![](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/07/logo-white.png)](http://www.wearemadeinny.com/)\n\n1\n\n438\n\nSHARES\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alleywatch.com%2F2020%2F02%2Fcharthop-\norganization-chart-management-tool-platform-ian-\nwhite%2F)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=ChartHop%20Raises%20%245M%20to%20Provide%20the%20Organizational%20Management%20Tools%20to%20Companies%20Poised%20to%20Scale&url=https://alleywat.ch/37OHG3V&via=AlleyWatch)\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?trk=ChartHop+Raises+%245M+to+Provide+the+Organizational+Management+Tools+to+Companies+Poised+to+Scale&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alleywatch.com%2F2020%2F02%2Fcharthop-\norganization-chart-management-tool-platform-ian-white%2F)\n\n[![](https://cdn.alleywatch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/8-1.jpg)](http://www.2020.alleywatch.com)\n\n[PREVIOUS POST](https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/02/paige-ai-cancer-diagnosis-\ntreatment-carla-leibowitz/)[NEXT POST](https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/02/the-\nweekly-notable-startup-funding-report-2-24-20/)\n\n# You are seconds away from signing up for the hottest list in New York Tech!\n\nJoin the millions and keep up with the stories shaping entrepreneurship.

And pointedly, there is little in the way of verification\nto prove that someone who claims to be working for a company really is.\n\nNow, a startup called [The Org](http://theorg.com) is hoping to take on\nLinkedIn and address that gap with an ambitious idea: to build a database\n(currently free to use) of organizational charts for every leading company,\nand potentially any company in the world, and then add features after that,\nsuch as job advertising -- for example organizations looking to hire people\nwhere there are obvious gaps in their org charts.\n\nWith 16,000 companies profiled so far on its platform, a total of 50,000\ncompanies in its database and around 100,000 visitors per month, The Org is\nannouncing $11 million in funding: a Series A of $8.5 million, and a\npreviously unannounced seed round of $2.5 million.\n\nLed by Founders Fund, the Series A also includes participation from Sequoia\nand Balderton, along with a number of angels.\n\nSequoia is actually a repeat investor: it also led The Org's $2.5 million seed\nround, which also had Founders Fund, Kevin Hartz, Elad Gil, Ryan Petersen, and\nSV Angel in it. Keith Rabois, who is now a partner at Founders Fund but once\nheld the role of VP of business and corporate development at LinkedIn, is also\njoining the startup's board of directors.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-20-at-01.16.38.png)\n\nCo-headquartered in New York and Copenhagen, Denmark, The Org was co-founded\nby Christian Wylonis (CEO) and Andreas Jarb\u00f8l, partly inspired by a piece in\nonline tech publication The Information, which provided an [org chart for the\ntop people at Airbnb](https://www.theinformation.com/org-charts/airbnb)\n(currently numbering 90 entries).\n\n\"This article went crazy viral,\" Wylonis said in an interview. \"I would\nunderstand why someone would be interested in this outside of Airbnb, but it\nturned out that people inside the company were fascinated by it, too. I\nstarted to think, when you take something like an org chart and make it\npublicly facing, I think it just becomes interesting.\"\n\nSo The Org set out to build a bigger business based on the concept.\n\nFor now, The Org is aimed at two distinct markets: those outside the company\nwho might most typically be interested in who is working where and doing what\nand reporting to whom -- for example, recruiters, those in human resources\ndepartments who are using the data to model their own organizational charts,\nor salespeople; and those inside the company (or again, outside) who are\nsimply interested in seeing who does what.\n\nThe Org is aiming to have 100,000 org charts on its platform by the end of the\nyear, with the longer-term goal being to cover 1 million. For now, the focus\nis on adding companies in the US before expanding to other markets.\n\nBut while the idea of building org charts for many companies sounds easy\nenough, there is also a reason why it hasn't been done yet: it's not nearly as\nsimple as it looks. That is one reason why even trying to surmount this issue\nis of interest to top VCs -- particularly those who have worked in startups\nand fast-growing tech companies themselves.\n\n\u201cToday, information about teams is unstructured, scattered, and unverified,\nmaking it hard for employees and recruiters to understand organizational\nstructures,\u201d said Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia Capital, in a statement.\n\n\u201cOrganizational charts were the secret weapon to forging partnerships during\nmy 20 years as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and Europe. Yet, they are a\ncarefully guarded secret, which have to be painstakingly put together by\nhand,\" said Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, general partner at Balderton Capital, in a\nstatement. \"The Org is surfacing this critical information, improving\nefficiency from the sales floor to the boardroom.\"\n\n\u201cUp-to-date org charts can be useful for everything from recruiting to sales,\nbut they are difficult and time consuming to piece together,\" added Rabois in\na statement. \"The Org is making this valuable information easily accessible in\na way we were never able to do at LinkedIn.\"\n\nThe approach that The Org is taking to building these profiles so far has been\na collaborative one. While The Org itself might establish some company names\nand seed and update them with information from publicly available sources,\nthat approach leaves a lot of gaps.\n\nThis is where a crowdsourced, wiki-style approach comes in. As with other\ncompany-based networking services such as Slack, users from a particular\ncompany can use their work email addresses to sign into that organization's\nprofile, and from there they can add or modify entries as you might enter data\nin a wiki -- the idea being that multiple people getting involved in the edits\nwill help keep the company's org chart more accurate.\n\nWhile The Org's idea holds a lot of promise and seems to fill a hole that\nother platforms like LinkedIn -- or, from another direction, Glassdoor -- do\nnot address in their own profiling of companies, I can see some challenges,\ntoo, that it might encounter as it grows.\n\nPlatforms that provide insights into a company landscape, such as LinkedIn or\nGlassdoor, are ultimately banked more around individuals and their own\nrepresentations. That means that by their nature these platforms may not ever\nprovide complete pictures of businesses themselves, just slices of it.\n\nThe Org, on the other hand, starts from the point of view of presenting the\ncompany itself, which means that the resulting gaps that arise might be more\napparent if they never get filled in, making The Org potentially less useful\nas a tool. (Consider for example either making sure the data is up to date, or\nwhether you have a complete or or partial picture of an engineering, marketing\nor operations team based solely on who has made the effort to update or\ndisclose information).\n\nSimilarly, if these charts really are often closely guarded by companies\n(something I don't doubt is true, since they could pose poaching risks, or\ncopycats in the form of companies attempting to build org structures based on\nwhat their more successful competitors are doing), I could see how some\ncompanies might start to approach The Org with requests to remove their\nprofiles and corresponding charts.\n\nWylonis said that \"99%\" of companies so far have been okay with what The Org\nis building.\n\n\"The way that we see it is that transparency is of interest to the people who\nwork there,\" he said. \"I think that everyone should strive for that. Why block\nit? The world is changing, and if the only way to keep your talent is by\nhiding your org chart you have other problems at your company.\"\n\nHe added that so far The Org has not had any official requests, \"but we have\nhad informal enquiries about how we get our information. And some companies\nemail us about changes. And when an individual person gets in touch and says,\n'I don't want to be here,' we delete that. But it's only happened a handful of\ntimes.\" It's not clear whether that proportion stays the same, or goes up or\ndown, as The Org grows.\n\nIn the meantime, the other big question that The Org will grapple with is just\nhow granular should it go?\n\n\"I hope that one day we can have an updated and complete org chart for every\nbusiness, but that might prove difficult,\" Wylonis said. Indeed, that could\nmean mapping out 1 million people at Walmart, for example. \"For the biggest\ncompanies, it may be that it works to map out the top 500, with the top 30-40\nfor smaller companies. And people can always go in and make corrections to\nexpand those if they want.\"\n\nInterestingly, the org chart appears to be having something of a startup\nmoment. Just hours after I published this, another called ChartHop [announced\nfunding](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/charthop-grabs-5m-seed-led-\nby-a16z-to-automate-the-org-\nchart/amp/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvLnVrLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFO9Jb98555vRnkXFrGcFBFtBQMC9hnEWh7Ux6SuYLBiB6i4Ha54-RE1CgdrZ_f3f7fb4pQ9SoGPvI0hAy2l6wcWEodrtYlqmMPXP5zHxjkKX2ubac8oc87g545x8GLXd0Ikmdioe23AunC372kHtf2iv5VOG0WyzFxqYuF18pjg).\nChartHop is the other side of the coin from The Org: it's addressing the same\nchallenge of needing a better way to track and view org charts, but it taps\nlots of internal resources at the company in question, and is not built with\nthe intention of sharing externally.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "What's new in ArcGIS Online (March 2020) - esri.com", "link": "https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/announcements/whats-new-arcgis-online-march-2020/", "guid": "CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcmkuY29tL2FyY2dpcy1ibG9nL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2FyY2dpcy1vbmxpbmUvYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50cy93aGF0cy1uZXctYXJjZ2lzLW9ubGluZS1tYXJjaC0yMDIwL9IBAA", "pubdate": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/announcements/whats-new-arcgis-online-march-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">What's new in ArcGIS Online (March 2020)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">esri.com</font>", "source": "esri.com", "body": "[ArcGIS Blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/overview/)\n\nMenu\n\n  * [Overview](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/overview/)\n  * [Topics](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/)\n\n    * [ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-online/)\n    * [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-pro/)\n    * [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-enterprise/)\n    * [ArcGIS Living Atlas](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-living-atlas/)\n    * [Apps](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/apps/)\n    * [Developers](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/developers/)\n    * [Story Maps](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/story-maps/)\n    * [Browse All](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/browse-all/)\n\n[ ArcGIS Online ](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-online/)\n\n# What's new in ArcGIS Online (March 2020)\n\n[ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-\nonline/overview) enables you to connect people, locations, and data using\ninteractive maps.

The March 2020 update includes 3D visualization\nenhancements, a redesigned user profile experience, and other improvements and\nnew functionality.\n\nOther products are released on independent timelines but are part of the\nonline ecosystem. This article summarizes those developments that have\noccurred since the December 2019 ArcGIS Online release. For additional details\nsee the [What\u2019s new help topic](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-\nonline/reference/whats-new.htm), [view all posts](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-\nblog/?s=#&tag=whats-new-march-2020) related to this release, or view specific\nproduct blogs.\n\n\n\n## Featured this release\n\n**3D visualization**\n\nYou can drape feature layers onto integrated mesh scene layers for better 3D\nvisualization. This enables you to gather a recent 3D snapshot of an area of\ninterest with [Drone2Map for ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-\nus/arcgis/products/drone2map/overview) or\n[SiteScan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/site-scan/id1113156576) as an\nintegrated mesh scene layer and easily mark locations with points, lines and\npolygons, as shown in the construction scene below. Set the elevation mode to\n[On the ground](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/scene-\nstyle-points.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_BA3902DA9A284BA994875B11AD51EB4E) for feature\nlayers.\n\n[ ![3D visualization](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/march-61s.jpg) View larger image\n](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/march-61.jpg)\n\nYou can now [label 3D object scene layers](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-\nonline/create-maps/scene-style-\nbuildings.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_62F0B5648B034CC5A58733F22C569C1D) based on an\nattribute, such as the building name or address.\n\nThe **Building explorer** tool has improved filtering options for building\nscene layers. Using a new filter you can [choose which construction\nphase](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/view-\nscenes.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_42F0C2B42988414EB1DDFFCF42EC3CB4) to show. For\nexample, you can choose a specific construction phase to display all the\ncomponents created during the phase and before. The Building explorer tool\nalso has improved visualization when the [level\npicker](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/view-\nscenes.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_5FF5D5C30A6D4E41AAD4EF625094B2F6) is used; the bottom\nlevels now appear semitransparent for added visual context.\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**Profile page**\n\nThe [user profile and settings](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-\nstarted/profile.htm) experience has been redesigned, allowing you to showcase\nyourself and your content through the refreshed user profile page. A separate\nuser settings page makes it easier to view your licenses, credits, and manage\nvarious account settings at once. If you are licensed with ArcGIS Pro, now you\ncan easily download it from licenses of the user settings page.

Highlights include **enhanced label authoring** with support\nfor multiline labeling, scale-dependent labels, and rotation. To learn more,\nsee [New labels in Map Viewer Beta](https://links.esri.com/agol-help/new-map-\nviewer/label-blog).\n\n[ ![Labels in Map Viewer Beta](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/march-43.jpg) Open in Map Viewer BETA\n](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=2cfbddaa1ee64151adb8616058db41a4)\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**Sharing and collaboration**\n\nYou can now **use filters to help you find specific groups** with which to\nshare your content. For example, choose the **Special Groups > Shared Update**\nfilter to display only [shared update\ngroups](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/create-\ngroups.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_12B3CD7ADAF843DB90182A01824B3152), or find other\ntypes of groups such as administrative or featured item groups. You can also\nfilter by owner or group creation date.\n\nYou can also **embed videos in item page and group page descriptions**. This\nallows you to provide additional information, context, and instructions about\nyour items or groups.\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**Configurable apps**\n\n[Configurable apps](http://www.esri.com/software/configurable-apps) are\ntemplate applications that you can configure easily, without any coding. They\nhelp you publish apps quickly for a variety of users and workflows.\nConfigurable apps are the fastest and easiest way to go from a map to a\nshareable app.\n\nThis release introduces a new **Minimalist (beta)** configurable app.\nMinimalist (beta) is built using the 4x version of the ArcGIS API for\nJavaScript. The app offers an updated user interface and support for newer\nfunctionality such as multi-component popups and dot density rendering. Also\nincluded is a revamped app configuration that provides a more efficient and\nstreamlined configuration experience. For more information, see [What\u2019s New in\nConfigurable Apps (March 2020)](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-\nblog/products/arcgis-online/announcements/whats-new-in-configurable-apps-\nmarch-2020/).\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**Data management**\n\nWhen purchasing an ArcGIS Online organizational subscription, you can now\nchoose the region\u2014United States or Europe\u2014where your geospatial data will be\nstored. The option to choose a **regional data hosting location** is available\nfor subscriptions purchased after the March 2020 update of ArcGIS Online.\n\nFor organizations activated before this date, all geospatial content and user\ninformation is stored in the United States. The regional data hosting location\nis displayed for new and existing organizations on the Overview tab of the\norganization page. See [What is regional data\nhosting](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-\nonline/reference/faq.htm#ESRI_QUESTIONANSWER_54FDDDDB61BB4CCB878A03732D899C32)\nto learn more.\n\nStreamlined **Edit settings** on hosted feature layers and hosted feature\nlayer views allow you to control the types of edits others can make to your\nlayer, including allowing or disallowing edits to feature geometries.\n\n[ ![Update settings](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/march-2.png) View manage editor setting help\n](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/manage-hosted-feature-\nlayers.htm#ESRI_STEP_A9683C018BE649C0AEB5B8BC01C13C9D)\n\nThe **size limit for files uploaded** to ArcGIS Online has increased from 200\nto 500 gigabytes.\n\nYou can **replace the contents of a scene layer you published** from a scene\nlayer package. This allows you to maintain the existing scene layer's item ID\nand URL, which means the scenes and apps that contain the scene layer will\nhave access to the updated content without you republishing the layer.\n\nA **new feature layer template** is available for collecting tabular data,\nsuch as sales data.\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**Accounts and administration**\n\nIn addition to Facebook and Google, a **new social login option** is available\nin ArcGIS Online. Developers and other GitHub users can sign in or sign up\nusing their **GitHub account** credentials. See [Sign in with a social\nlogin](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/sign-\nin.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_2B1689DE0E244634A264DF67BAB5FA14) for more information.\n\nWhen you **set the language** for your organization, you can now specify a\n[number and date format](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-\nonline/administer/configure-\ngeneral.htm#ESRI_SECTION3_148C737360EA487A9043E71B3C7C21B2) for three\nadditional languages\u2014French, German, and Italian. Individual organization\nmembers and those with public accounts can also change the number and date\nformat through their profile page. For example, if the language is set to\nFrench, you can display dates and numbers using the formats defined in the\n[Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](http://cldr.unicode.org/) for France\nand Switzerland.\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**ArcGIS Notebooks (beta)**\n\nArcGIS Online organizations can create notebooks using the new **beta version\nof ArcGIS Notebooks**. [ArcGIS Notebooks](https://www.esri.com/en-\nus/arcgis/products/arcgis-notebooks/overview) integrate Jupyter, the popular\nopen source Python notebook format, directly within ArcGIS Online. Notebooks\nare an efficient, modern environment that combines code, on-the-fly\nvisualizations, analysis tools, and maps. They are also very useful for\nautomating administrative tasks, such as managing users and content.\n\nArcGIS Notebooks has been optimized to allow the easy addition of data and\nanalysis tools as code snippets. In addition to the standard analysis tools of\nArcGIS Online, Notebooks deliver options to work with the [ArcGIS Python\nlibraries](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-python-\nlibraries/overview), and open source Python libraries.\n\n[ ![ArcGIS Notebooks](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/march-4s.jpg) View larger image\n](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/march-4.jpg)\n\nNotebooks are **now available in ArcGIS Online via a public beta**. During the\nbeta, normal credit rates apply for running analysis, accessing premium\ncontent, and storage.\n\nAdministrators will see Notebooks as an option in the top navigation pane and\ncan begin using them immediately. Organizational members will require\nadditional privileges before they will be able to start working with ArcGIS\nNotebooks.\n\nFor more information about ArcGIS Notebooks Beta, see [ArcGIS Notebooks Beta -\nOnline](https://community.esri.com/community/arcgis-notebook-beta-online) on\nGeoNet or [ArcGIS Notebooks public beta is here](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-\nblog/products/arcgis-online/analytics/arcgis-notebooks-public-beta/).\n\n![](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/breakgray.png)\n\n**ArcGIS Companion**\n\n[ArcGIS Companion](https://community.esri.com/community/arcgis-companion)\nmakes it easy to use ArcGIS from your mobile device to explore content, view\ngroups, edit your profile, and more.\n\nThe latest release includes **support for the new Storyteller user type** and\nsupport for Enterprise 10.8.

Masters](https://www.inc.com/inc-masters)\n\n#\n\nHiring for Growth: 5 Dynamic Tips and Strategies\n\n## Everyone loves to see their company grow, but unless you plan for growth\nduring the hiring process, you could be setting yourself up for disaster\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[By Shu Saito](/author/null)Founder & CEO, All Filters\n\n![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_949182974_405323.jpg)\n\nGetty Images\n\nGrowth can be exciting. It means you are doing something right, and your\naudience supports your mission and buys your products or services. However,\nunplanned growth can lead to chaos, miscommunication, and, ultimately, a shaky\nbottom line.\n\nOne way to avoid these problems is to plan for growth as you begin to\nestablish your business, especially before you hire each new employee. Your\nbusiness objectives, the integrity of your company culture, and your success\ndepend on hiring the right people who can both grow with the company and help\nfacilitate the company's growth. In my own businesses, I keep several\nstrategies in mind during the hiring process.\n\n _Use organization charts to plan for the future_\n\nWhile organization charts are often seen as simply a static way to map out a\ncompany's structure, they can also be used as a dynamic planning tool for\nhiring. They allow you to visualize where your company is growing as well as\nwhich roles may need support.\n\nTo use an organization chart for hiring, first create an organization chart\nthat reflects your current organization. That may be just you, or you may have\na partner or a handful of employees. In your initial map, include items such\nas names, positions, and the reporting structure.\n\nNow, you can get creative. Try to envision the future growth of the\norganization. You can use dashed boxes to represent where you can potentially\nhire in the future and where each person or position belongs. This allows you\nto see at a glance where the company needs to grow as well as the future state\nof your organization. Programs such [Creately](https://creately.com/) can help\nyou color-code, organize, and create a dynamic organization chart that include\npotential roles, potential hire dates, expected salaries, essential skills for\nsuccess, and more. Your imagination is the limit.\n\n _Generate a strategic hiring plan to test the waters_\n\nAfter you have generated an organization chart, you are ready to create a\nstrategic hiring plan. Keep in mind that hiring plans involve more than just\nnumbers and checklists. A hiring plan should prompt business leaders to pause\nand think about their long-term goals and growth. Ideally, writing a hiring\nplan should involve all members of the leadership team. Consider asking\nquestions such as:\n\n  * What talent needs to be hired over the next several years?\n  * Are there specific hiring events to consider?\n  * How do our company's goals match our hiring pace?\n  * What teams need to fill/create which positions?\n\nIn short, creating a strategic hiring plan is an exciting opportunity to\nremind different teams and levels of management about company goals and the\nways they can work together to achieve those goals.\n\n _Write a dynamic job description to attract high-quality applicants_\n\nWriting a compelling job description can make or break your efforts to hire\nfor growth. Instead of creating a cookie-cutter list of static skills, try to\ncreate a description that looks for more generative skills, such as critical\nthinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity. This creates a set of\nexpectations rather than simply a checklist. When reviewing responses to your\njob description, keep in mind how potential employees' answers align with your\ncompany culture, values, and goals, and growth plans.\n\n _Consider using a personality test to filter applicants_\n\nUse a personality test to find an applicant that has the highest match to the\nposition you are trying to fill. Personality tests, such as [The Caliper\nProfile](https://calipercorp.com/caliper-profile/) specifically measure how a\ncandidate's personality traits correlate to job performance. To create a more\ncomprehensive analysis than other personality tests, employers have the option\nof customizing this test to target specific behaviors. In short, using a\npersonality test during the hiring process allows you to hire for attitudes\nthat will support your company's values and goals.\n\n _Keep track of training to prevent stagnant growth_\n\nThe hiring process isn't over once the potential employee signs the hiring\npapers. You've spent time and money finding the right person, and you want to\nmake sure that both your and their expectations are being met. An employee\ntracker is an invaluable tool to ensure that your new hire is receiving the\nappropriate training and certification. It's good if you can have employees to\ntake a two- to five-week training plan and then evaluate again after 90 days.\n\nIt's also important to find a program that can grow with you. In other words,\nyou want an employee tracker that is scalable, no matter what your goals are.\nChoose from one of several viable options, such as\n[DeskTime](https://desktime.com/) and [Time Camp](https://www.timecamp.com).\nWhichever one you choose, keep in mind that it can be a useful tool for\nkeeping everyone updated on what the company is doing and how it's achieving\nits missions and goals.\n\n _Use the tools at your disposal_\n\nOne of the most important ways to keep control of your company's growth is to\nalways hire with the future in mind. A new employee has the potential to\naccelerate your company's growth, but identifying and onboarding the right\nperson is critical.\n\nOne way to ensure you have the right person is to use the various tools\navailable to you, including organizational charts, a strategic hiring plan, a\ndynamic job description, personality tests, and training trackers. These tools\ncan help you manage your company's growth and also allow you to generate and\npush your business in exciting and new directions.\n\n _Shu Saito founded[All\nFilters](https://www.allfilters.com/refrigeratorfilters)_ _in 2009 and has\nserved as its CEO since its inception.

And Abstract Ventures, the a16z Cultural\nLeadership Fund, CoFound, Cowboy Ventures, Flybridge Capital, Shrug Capital,\nWork Life Ventures as well as startup founders and C-level executives\nparticipated in the round.\n\nLeaders have long been constrained by archaic tools and processes used to\nmanage their organization due to manual programs and outdated spreadsheets to\ninefficient meetings and incomplete data. And organizations have invested over\n$20 billion in HR technology over the last five years, but 65% of them still\nfeel the technology is inadequate at supporting their companies\u2019 objectives.\n\nChartHop helps organizations optimize their most important driver to success \u2014\npeople. And using the ChartHop platform, decision-makers can visualize, plan,\nand analyze their organization within minutes, while employees gain valuable\ninsights into how the company works at-large.\n\nAnd ChartHop essentially enables customers to streamline organizational\nmanagement across People, Finance, Recruiting, and team managers by providing\none platform for syncing People data and collaboratively building headcount\nplans.\n\nWith the ChartHop platform, customers can structure and analyze People data by\nmultiple factors, including location, salary, stock grants, number of direct\nreports, gender, etc. This analysis allows leaders to more clearly understand\ntheir organization in real-time and breaking through information silos and\nunearthing hidden biases.\n\nEver since ChartHop launched in 2018, dozens of companies have turned to the\npeople platform to revamp their organizational management strategies,\nincluding Assurance, Better Mortgage, InVision, MongoDB, R\u00e9my Cointreau,\nSequoia Consulting Group, and Teachable.\n\n**Key Quotes:**\n\n_\u201cTechnology shouldn\u2019t hinder HR and People teams from being strategic\nbusiness partners or supporting employees \u2014 it should empower them. This\ninvestment fuels our mission to equip all leaders with a data-informed\napproach to organizational management.\u201d_\n\n- ChartHop founder, CEO and CTO Ian White\n\n_\u201cPeople are the backbone of every great organization, but the software to\nsupport them has historically been painfully inefficient and woefully\ninsufficient. ChartHop fixes that by connecting disparate systems and creating\nan unprecedented level of transparency the entire organization can benefit\nfrom.

Strong digital organizations today can\nbecome obsolete in a matter of years or even months if they don't evolve their\nteam patterns and interactions and take full advantage of their people's\nskills and teamwork.\n\n**How can CIOs benefit from reading 'Team Topologies'?**\n\n'Team Topologies' demonstrates an evolutionary, team-first approach to\norganization design, taking into consideration the mirroring effect of\n[Conway's\nLaw](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Conway-2527s-5Flaw&d=DwMFaQ&c=tEbGsWWjqkBSpaWdXc_mdMSanI1bDu-\nFKXiKGCfVmPM&r=K1b9uWkA525XVksYOG-\naH7e2BJxQ01ZIKmrk0XABNNM&m=A3ZAhjnQWl7VqdNEoE1KzsvTzog8jMhozFJtTOBq9l8&s=Ql1Y1AyGV52bs-\nwP4GX4UDgicJ9A-kqZC5WCVYNbedw&e=). This law, confirmed by multiple independent\nstudies, states that the communication structures in an organization strongly\ninfluence the final architecture in any software system. This means that\nthinking of software as purely technical decisions without regard for the\norganizational structure will lead to delivery of problematic systems and\nwasted effort as teams try to 'fight' the naturally emerging architecture.\n\n'Team Topologies' provides a practical approach for CIOs to leverage Conway's\nLaw into a strategic advantage by organizing their teams to maximize the\nchance of producing the desired systems, rather than, unknowingly, being\nnegatively affected by it.\n\nThe book also covers many other important aspects for high-performing modern\ntech organizations, such as treating teams as fundamental units of delivery\nand the impact on team composition, office layout, rewards and so on; how to\nsimplify the intercommunication between teams, being more intentional about\npurpose, duration and outcomes of collaboration, thus minimizing waste and\nblockers to fast flow; how to evolve team structures depending on internal and\nexternal stimuli; and more.\n\n[!['Team Topologies' book\ncover](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/Team-Topologies_Book-\nCover.jpg)Click here to learn  \nmore about this book.](https://itrevolution.com/book/team-topologies/)\n\n_The following is an excerpt from Chapter 1 in the book_ Team Topologies:\nOrganizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow _._\n\n### __Communication Structures of an Organization\n\nMost organizations want or are required to have a single view of their teams\nand people called the \"org chart.\" This chart depicts the teams, departments,\nunits, and other organizational entities, as well as how they relate to each\nother. It usually shows hierarchical lines of reporting, which imply lines of\ncommunication running \"up and down\" the organization.\n\nThe org chart does have its uses in the context of building software systems,\nspecifically around regulatory and legal compliance. However, in a highly\ncollaborative context filled with uncertainty over outcomes, relying on the\norg chart as a principal mechanism of splitting the work to be done leads to\nunrealistic expectations. We need to rely instead on decoupled, long-lived\nteams that can collaborate effectively to meet the challenge of balancing\nspeed and safety.\n\nThe problem with taking the org chart at face value is that we end up trying\nto architect people as if they were software, neatly keeping their\ncommunication within the accepted lines. But people don't restrict their\ncommunications only to those connected lines on the chart. We reach out to\nwhomever we depend on to get work done. We bend the rules when required to\nachieve our goals. That's why _actual_ communication lines look quite\ndifferent from the org chart.\n\n### __Org Chart Thinking Is the Problem\n\nTraditional org charts don't help us understand what the actual patterns of\ncommunication in our organization are. Instead, organizations need to develop\nmore realistic pictures of the expected and actual communication happening\nbetween individuals and teams. The gaps will help inform what types of systems\nare a better fit for the organization.\n\nFurthermore, decisions based on org-chart structure tend to optimize for only\npart of the organization, ignoring upstream and downstream effects. Local\noptimizations help the teams directly involved, but they don't necessarily\nhelp improve the overall delivery of value to customers. Their impact might be\nnegligent if there are larger bottlenecks in the stream of work. For example,\nhaving teams adopting cloud and infrastructure-as-code can reduce the time to\nprovision new infrastructure from weeks or months to minutes or hours. But if\nevery change requires deployment (to production) approval from a board that\nmeets once a week, then delivery speed will remain weekly at best.\n\nSystems thinking focuses on optimizing for the whole, looking at the overall\nflow of work, identifying what the largest bottleneck is today, and\neliminating it. Then repeat. Team Topologies focuses on how to set up dynamic\nteam structures and interaction modes that can help teams adapt quickly to new\nconditions, and achieve fast and safe software delivery. This might not be\nyour largest bottleneck today, but eventually, you will face the issue of\nrigid team structures with poor communication and/or inadequate processes,\nslowing down delivery.\n\nThinking of the org chart as a faithful representation of how work gets done\nand how teams interact with each other leads to ineffective decisions around\nallocation of work and responsibilities. Much like a software architecture\ndocument gets outdated as soon as the actual software development starts, an\norg chart is always out of sync with reality.\n\nNaturally, we are by no means the first to acknowledge the imbalance between\nformal organization structures and the way work actually gets done. Geary\nRummler and Alan Brache's book _Improving Performance: How to Manage the White\nSpace on the Organization Chart_ set the stage for continuous business process\nimprovement and management. The recent focus (at least within IT) on product\nand team centricity, as illustrated by Mik Kersten's book on moving from\n_Project to Product_ , is another major milestone. We like to think that Team\nTopologies is another piece of this puzzle -- in particular, having clear and\nfluid team structures, responsibilities, and interaction modes.\n\n### __Beyond the Org Chart\n\nSo if org charts are not an accurate representation of organizational\nstructures, what is? Niels Pflaeging, author of _Organize for Complexity_ ,\nidentifies not one but three different organizational structures in every\norganization:\n\n  1. Formal structure (the org chart) -- facilitates compliance\n  2. Informal structure -- the \"realm of influence\" between individuals\n  3. Value creation structure -- how work actually gets done based on inter-personal and inter-team reputation\n\nPflaeging suggests that the key to successful knowledge work organizations is\nin the interactions between the informal structure and the value creation\nstructure (that is, the interactions between people and teams). Other authors\nhave proposed similar characterizations, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux in\n_Reinventing Organizations_ or Brian Robertson's _Holacracy_ approach.\n\nThe Team Topologies approach acknowledges the importance of informal and value\ncreation structures as defined by Pflaeging. By empowering teams, and treating\nthem as fundamental building blocks, individuals inside those teams move\ncloser together to act as a team rather than just a group of people. On the\nother hand, by explicitly agreeing on interaction modes with other teams,\nexpectations on behaviors become clearer and inter-team trust grows.\n\nOver the last several decades, there have been many new approaches to\norganizing businesses, but usually the new design remains a static view of the\norganization that does not take into consideration the real behaviors and\nstructures that emerge after reorganization. For instance, the \"matrix\nmanagement\" approach that started in the 1990s -- and became quite popular\nover the next couple of decades -- tried to address the inherent complexity of\nhighly uncertain, highly skilled work by having individuals report to both\nbusiness and functional managers. Despite a clearer focus on business value\ncompared to a purely functional organization of teams, this is still a static\nview of the world that becomes outdated as the business and technology domains\nquickly evolve.\n\nFor workers, re-orgs, like introducing matrix management, can bring a lot of\nfear and worry. Often, it's seen as a time and effort drain that is more\nlikely to set the business back rather than move it forward. And once the next\ntechnological or methodological revolution hits, the business undertakes yet\nanother re-org, breaking down established forms of communication and splitting\nup teams that were just starting to get their mojo.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that relying on a single, static organizational\nstructure, like the org chart or matrix management, is untenable for effective\noutcomes with modern software systems. Instead of a single structure, what is\nneeded is a model that is adaptable to the current situation -- one that takes\ninto consideration how teams grow and interact with each other. Team\nTopologies provides the (r)evolutionary approach required to keep teams,\nprocesses, and technology aligned for all kinds of organizations.\n\nIn her excellent 2015 book, _Guide to Organisation Design: Creating High-\nPerforming and Adaptable Enterprises_ , Naomi Stanford lists five rules of\nthumb for designing organizations:\n\n  1. Design when there is a compelling reason.\n  2. Develop options for deciding on a design.\n  3. Choose the right time to design.\n  4. Look for clues that things are out of alignment.\n  5. Stay alert to the future.\n\nAs we continue to move through this book, we will explore how to address these\nfive heuristics for organization design.\n\n### __Team Topologies: A New Way of Thinking about Teams\n\nThe Team Topologies approach brings new thinking around effective team\nstructures for enterprise software delivery. It provides a consistent,\nactionable guide for evolving team design to continuously cope with\ntechnology, people, and business changes, covering size, shape, placement,\nresponsibilities, boundaries, and interaction of teams building and running\nmodern software systems.\n\nTeam Topologies provides four fundamental team types -- _stream-aligned,\nplatform, enabling, and complicated-subsystem_ \\-- and three core team\ninteraction modes -- _collaboration, X-as-a-Service, and facilitating_.\nTogether with awareness of Conway's law, team cognitive load, and how to\nbecome a sensing organization, Team Topologies results in an effective and\nhumanistic approach to building and running software systems.\n\nIn particular, it looks at ways in which different team topologies can evolve\nwith technological and organizational maturity. Periods of technical and\nproduct discovery typically require a highly collaborative environment (with\noverlapping team boundaries) to succeed. But keeping the same structures when\ndiscovery is over (established technologies and product) can lead to wasted\neffort and misunderstandings.\n\nBy emphasizing an adaptive model for organization design and actively\nprioritizing the interrelationship of teams, the Team Topologies approach\nprovides a key technology-agnostic mechanism for modern software-intensive\nenterprises to sense when a change in strategy is required (either from a\nbusiness or technology viewpoint). The end goal is to help teams produce\nsoftware that aligns with customer needs and is easier to build, run, and own.\n\nTeam Topologies also emphasizes a humanistic approach to designing and\nbuilding software systems. It sees the team as an indivisible element of\nsoftware delivery and acknowledges that teams have a finite cognitive capacity\nthat needs to be respected. Together with the dynamic team design solidly\ngrounded on Conway's law, Team Topologies becomes a strategic tool for\nsolution discovery.\n\n### __The Revival of Conway's Law\n\nWe've mentioned the importance of Conway's law as a driver for team design and\nevolution. But what is this law exactly?\n\nIn 1968, the computer systems researcher Mel Conway published a paper in\n_Datamation_ called \"How Do Committees Invent?\" in which he explored the\nrelationship between organizational structure and the resulting design of\nsystems. The article is full of sparkling insights, some of which we cover\nlater in this chapter, but this is the phrase that became known as Conway's\nlaw: \"Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce\ndesigns which are copies of the communication structures of these\norganizations.\"\n\nConway based his observation on organizations building early electronic\ncomputer systems. In his words, this \"law\" indicates the strong correlation\nbetween an organization's real communication paths (the value creation\nstructures mentioned by Pflaeging) and the resulting software architecture, or\nwhat author Allan Kelly calls the \"homomorphic force.\" This homomorphic force\ntends to make things the same shape between the software architecture and team\nstructures. In other words, building software requires an understanding of\ncommunication across teams in order to realistically consider what kind of\nsoftware architectures are feasible. If the desired theoretical system\narchitecture does not fit the organizational model, then one of the two will\nneed to change.\n\nEric Raymond stated this in a humorous way in his book _The New Hacker's\nDictionary_ : \"If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a\n4-pass compiler.\"\n\nSince 1968, it has become increasingly clear that Conway's law continues to\napply to all software built. Those of us who have built software systems that\nhad to comply with an \"architecture blueprint\" can surely remember having\ntimes when it felt like we were fighting against the architecture rather than\nit helping steer our work in the right direction. Well, that's Conway's law in\naction.\n\nA sort of \"revival\" of Conway's law took place around 2015, when microservices\narchitectures were on the rise. In particular, James Lewis, Technical Director\nat Thoughtworks, and others came up with the idea of applying an \"inverse\nConway maneuver\" (or reverse Conway maneuver), whereby an organization focuses\non organizing team structures to  match the architecture they want the system\nto exhibit rather than expecting teams to follow a mandated architecture\ndesign.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that thinking of software architecture as a stand-\nalone concept that can be designed in isolation and then implemented by any\ngroup of teams is fundamentally wrong. This gap between architecture and team\nstructures is visible across all types of architectures, from client-server\nto SOA and even microservices. Specifically, that is why monoliths need to be\nbroken down (in particular, any indivisible software part that exceeds the\ncognitive capacity of any one team) while keeping a team focus, a topic we\nwill discuss in depth in Chapter 6.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Digital business transformation and innovation\n\n  * [\n\n##### A few fundamental microservices team structure strategies\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/kanjilal_joydip.jpg) By: Joydip\nKanjilal ](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/tip/A-few-fundamental-\nmicroservices-team-structure-strategies)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Project management tools and strategies: Gantt charts, PERT charts and\nPM planning tools\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/courtemanche_meredith_2.jpg)\nBy: Meredith Courtemanche\n](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tutorial/Project-management-\ntools-and-strategies-Gantt-charts-PERT-charts-and-PM-planning-tools)\n\n  * [\n\n##### A brief index of network configuration basics\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/goss_michaela.jpg) By: Michaela\nGoss ](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/feature/A-brief-index-of-\nnetwork-configuration-basics)\n\n  * [\n\n##### The organizational psychology of IoT\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/benson_mark.jpg) By: Mark\nBenson ](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/blog/IoT-Agenda/The-\norganizational-psychology-of-IoT)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/publisher_contributor.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/IT-Revolution)\n\n[IT Revolution](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/IT-Revolution) asks:\n\n## What types of communication structures does your organization utilize\ntoday?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [The Strategic Movement from an App-Focused User Experience to a Holistic One](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Strategic-Movement-from-an-App-Focused-User-Experience-to-a-Holistic-One) -Citrix\n  * [Removing Barriers to Moving Mission-Critical Apps to Public Cloud](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/PublicCloud/Removing-Barriers-to-Moving-Mission-Critical-Apps-to-Public-Cloud) -IBM\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [See More](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Conway's law](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Conways-law) - WhatIs.com\n  * [A few fundamental microservices team structure ...](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/tip/A-few-fundamental-microservices-team-structure-strategies) - SearchAppArchitecture\n  * [Agile application lifecycle management is not an ...](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/Agile-application-lifecycle-management-is-not-an-oxymoron) - SearchSoftwareQuality\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 1 comment\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

and processes used to manage their organization \u2014 from manual\nprograms and outdated spreadsheets to inefficient meetings and incomplete\ndata. Organizations have invested more than $20 billion in HR technology over\nthe last five years, yet 65 percent of them still feel the technology is\ninadequate at supporting their companies\u2019 objectives.\n\nEmerging from stealth mode today, [ChartHop](https://www.charthop.com/) helps\norganizations optimize their most important driver to success \u2014 people. Using\nthe ChartHop platform, decision-makers can visualize, plan and analyze their\norganization within minutes, while employees get valuable insight into how the\ncompany works at-large. ChartHop is the world\u2019s first organizational\nmanagement platform.\n\nChartHop also announced it has raised $5 million seed investment led by\nAndreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other backers include Abstract Ventures, the a16z\nCultural Leadership Fund, CoFound, Cowboy Ventures, Flybridge Capital, Shrug\nCapital, Work Life Ventures, as well as prominent startup founders and C-level\nexecutives.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ian White, the Brooklyn, New York-based ChartHop is the\nworld\u2019s first organizational management platform empowering leaders and team\nmembers alike to see the past and present of their organization and design its\nfuture. The platform automagically builds fluid, data-driven views of a\ncompany through real-time updated org charts, custom reporting, and headcount\nplanning tools that boost efficiency and transparency across teams. Simply put\n\u2014 ChartHop makes organizations run and scale better. ChartHop plays well with\n20 plus platforms, including ADP, BambooHR, Carta, Greenhouse, Lever, SAP\nSuccessFactors, Workday and more.\n\n\u201cTechnology shouldn\u2019t hinder HR and People teams from being strategic business\npartners or supporting employees \u2014 it should empower them,\u201d said Ian White,\nChartHop\u2019s founder, CEO and CTO. \u201cThis investment fuels our mission to equip\nall leaders with a data-informed approach to organizational management.\u201d\n\nChartHop enables customers to streamline organizational management across\nPeople, Finance, Recruiting, and team managers by providing one platform for\nsyncing People data and collaboratively building headcount plans. With the\nplatform, customers can structure and analyze People data by multiple factors,\nincluding location, salary, stock grants, number of direct reports, gender,\nand more. This in-depth analysis allows leaders to more clearly understand\ntheir organization in real-time, breaking through information silos and\nunearthing hidden biases.\n\n\u201cPeople are the backbone of every great organization, but the software to\nsupport them has historically been painfully inefficient and woefully\ninsufficient. ChartHop fixes that by connecting disparate systems and creating\nan unprecedented level of transparency the entire organization can benefit\nfrom,\u201d said David Ulevitch, General Partner, a16z. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner\nwith Ian and the ChartHop team as they deliver the products that help\ncompanies run and scale.\u201d\n\nSince ChartHop launched in 2018, dozens of companies have turned to the people\nplatform to revamp their organizational management strategies, including\nAssurance, Better Mortgage, InVision, MongoDB, R\u00e9my Cointreau, Sequoia\nConsulting Group, and Teachable.\n\n\"I can't imagine what we'd do without ChartHop,\" said David Dankenbrink, VP of\nHuman Resources at R\u00e9my Cointreau. \"With a number of features, such as the\nauto-updated org chart, custom reporting and real-time scenario-building,\nChartHop has been a critical tool in my organization's succession planning and\ndata comprehension.\"\n\n\u201cLeaders need a simple and effective tool to have a comprehensive view of\ntheir entire organization,\u201d said Melissa Lightbody, Chief People Officer at\nSequoia Consulting Group. \u201cChartHop solves that challenge for us.\u201d\n\n<https://www.charthop.com/home/H1_time_travel_04.mp4>\n\n0\n\nShares\n\n  * [__Share On

Relying on\norg charts to guide workforce management decisions is both foolish and\ndangerous in a digitalized world. Read on for my thoughts on the past, present\nand future of org charts and workforce management.\n\n**_The fundamentals of workforce management_**\n\nThe term workforce management refers to decisions and actions taken to align\nthe structure of the organization with the needs of the business. It\nencompasses things like organizational restructuring, downsizing and headcount\nplanning. Org charts are usually the primary tool used to guide and execute\nworkforce management decisions. But probably not for much longer.\n\nTo understand what the next generation of workforce management will look like,\nit is useful to look at what is and is not changing about organizations.\nTechnology is causing organizations to radically change what they do, how they\ndo it and where they do it. But one thing about organizations is not changing:\nthey rely on people working together to accomplish shared goals. The nature of\nwork changes constantly, but how people function as humans does not. The\nunderlying psychology of people does not evolve as fast as technology.\nConsequently, by understanding the core psychological elements that impact\norganizational functioning we can make more accurate predictions about how\nworkforce management is likely to change over time.\n\nThe purpose of workforce management is to create organizations that\neffectively leverage employees to accomplish company objectives. But why do\npeople join organizations? What advantages do they provide over going it\nalone? Organizations provide employees with three tangible things that make\nthem attractive places to work:\n\n**Roles:** the chance to work on meaningful and/or interesting projects and\nactivities.\n\n**Resources:** access to financial, technological and material assets\n(including compensation).\n\n**Relationships:** the opportunity to work with other people we trust, like\nand can learn from\n\nThese three things embody the concept of an \u201corganization\u201d in the sense that\nit is people working together (relationships) using shared assets (resources)\nto accomplish common goals (roles).\n\n**_A look at workforce management in the past_**\n\nBefore the advent of the internet economy, work was largely defined and\nconstrained by geography. Most people worked in co-located teams in the same\noffice, store or factory under leaders located in the same building or city.\nMost org charts fell along geographic lines. The person at the top of the org\nchart managed and controlled the resources in a particular location or region\n(e.g. compensation, budget, materials). Most of the people in the region\nreported up to that leader and shared common overall goals. And the people\nlower in the org chart tended to work in the same location with each other. In\nthe pre-internet world, roles, resources and relationships tended to merge\ntogether. Where people worked often defined the kind of work they did (roles),\nwho they worked with (relationships) and their access to budgets, technology\nand tools (resources). Org charts were a relatively effective tool for\nworkforce management in the pre-internet world because there was so much\noverlap between roles, resources and relationships.\n\n**_The present state of workforce management_**\n\nThe rise of the internet and corresponding shift to virtual workforces has\ncreated a split between organizational roles, relationships and resources.\nThey are no longer defined or constrained by geography. It is common for\npeople to work in one city, report to a manager in another city and work with\npeople across the world. Where an employee lives may tell you nothing about\nwhat they do. In the digital world, a job is not about where you work\nphysically. A job is defined by your goals, who you work with and the\nresources you have access to.\n\nThe digitalization of work has also radically changed the nature and influence\nof roles, relationships and resources within organizations.\n\n  * **Roles. __** There was a time when a person\u2019s work could largely be defined by a static job description. Those days are gone in many organizations. The pace of change in the modern economy requires employees to rapidly shift their focus across different goals and activities. People\u2019s work is not defined by their formal job title, but by the particular objectives and projects they are working on right now. \n  * **Relationships.** One of the biggest impacts of digitalization is the ability to develop and maintain relationships with people anywhere in the world. Digitalization also increases the value of these relationships. Building and maintaining effective relationships is critical to creating agile organizations that can quickly adapt to fast-changing markets. Agility requires collaboration, collaboration requires trust and trust comes through strong relationships.\n  * **Resources.** Digitalization has made resources both more accessible and more flexible. Cloud technology enables employees to access tools and resources from across the world no matter where they are physically located. This technology also allows business leaders to more easily shift and track how resources are being allocated and used around the globe. Historically, the primary \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for accessing resources such as technology, materials or budget was an employee\u2019s direct manager. Now employees are often empowered and expected to request resources directly from the company with little to no involvement of their manager.\n\nThe org chart captures very little of the information about roles,\nrelationships and resources needed to make intelligent workforce management\ndecisions in the digital world. The org chart\u2019s greatest shortcomings are\nabout roles and relationships. An org chart might reflect how a company\nreports its financial numbers, but tells almost nothing about the roles and\nrelationships that are critical to driving those numbers.\n\n**_The future of workforce management_**\n\nThere are two main reasons companies still use org charts for workforce\nmanagement. First, org charts are simple for senior leaders to understand.\nThinking about organizational change from the perspective of how it truly\nimpacts roles and relationships can be complex and time-consuming. Second, no\none has developed an effective alternative set of tools to replace the\ntraditional org chart. Happily, we seem to be on the verge of this changing.\n\nWhat we need are tools to manage three kinds of charts.\n\n  * **Resource charts. **Tools that show the reporting relationships used to manage different kinds of resources. This may look similar to the traditional org chart, but must enable looking at reporting relationships from multiple perspectives. This includes having ways to capture the use of more matrixed reporting relationships such as those that [divide operational reporting from talent management reporting](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/02/expanding-performance-management-to-balance-near-term-business-goals-with-long-term-workforce-development/).  \n\n  * **Relationship charts.** Tools that show the strength and nature of people\u2019s working relationships based on membership in cross-functional groups and interaction patterns captured by analyzing e-mail traffic, social networks and other forms of communications data. Some very interesting [research](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-most-valuable-people-in-yo) has been done in this area, but it has not yet made it into the mainstream field of workforce management.   \n\n  * **Role charts. **Tools that track and illustrate the nature of people\u2019s work based on membership in project teams, the nature of the goals they are currently working on and the skills that enable them to perform different types of roles. Ideally this information would replace job titles entirely. Because in the digital world, knowing someone\u2019s job title often tells you little to nothing about what they actually do now or what they are capable of doing. \n\nDigitalization has increased the need for people and organizations to more\neffectively manage roles and relationships. This has resulted in new purpose-\nbuilt technologies such as LinkedIn for relationship management and Trello for\nrole management. But these tools are not designed to influence workforce\nmanagement decisions.\n\n**_Conclusion_**\n\nThe effectiveness of companies in the digital age depends far more on\neffectively managing employee roles and relationships than it did in the past.\nYet workforce management decisions continue to focus almost exclusively on\ndefining who has formal management authority over resources, particularly\npeople. Workforce management decisions guided by org charts inevitably fail to\nconsider the quality and value of existing role structures and relationship\nnetworks. Managing workforces though org charts certainly impacts employee\nroles and relationships, but often not in a good way.\n\nThe use of org charts and the resulting focus it puts on \u201cresource control\u201d\nengenders a command and control leadership mentality that is antithetical to\ncreating the agile, engaged workforces need to compete in the digital age. On\nthe other hand, there will always be a need for some form of formal reporting\nrelationship such as those found on org charts. We cannot and should not try\nto get rid of org charts entirely. Instead, we need to develop new forms of\norg charts that move beyond the focus on formal reporting relationships to\nincorporate role and relationship data.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Forganizational-charts-digitalization-and-workforce-\nmanagement-past-present-and-\nfuture%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Organizational+Charts%2C+Digitalization%2C+and+Workforce+Management%3A+Past%2C+Present%2C+and+Future\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Organizational+Charts%2C+Digitalization%2C+and+Workforce+Management%3A+Past%2C+Present%2C+and+Future&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Forganizational-charts-digitalization-and-workforce-\nmanagement-past-present-and-\nfuture%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Forganizational-charts-digitalization-and-workforce-\nmanagement-past-present-and-\nfuture%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Forganizational-charts-digitalization-and-workforce-\nmanagement-past-present-and-\nfuture%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Organizational Charts, Digitalization, and\nWorkforce Management: Past, Present, and\nFuture&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Forganizational-charts-digitalization-and-workforce-\nmanagement-past-present-and-\nfuture%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Performance Management & HCM ](/category/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/ \"Performance Management & HCM\")\n\n  * [ ![5 Performance Management Trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup, BetterWorks, and HBR](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/5_performance_management_trends_from_gartner_mercer_gallup_betterworks_and_hbr_5e57dccfb4502.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/important-performance-management-trends/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 5 Performance Management Trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/important-performance-management-\ntrends/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nHere five key performance management trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR that are poised to reshape HR this year.\n\nby [Chiradeep BasuMallick](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/chiradeep-\nbasumallick/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Feb 27, 2020\n\n  * [ ![How Skill Development Can Meet the Demands of Automation: Q&A With JFF\u2019s Maria Flynn](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/jobs_of_the_future_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dd3c79f72c0a.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/performance-management-hcm/maria-flynn-jff-skill-development-and-training/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How Skill Development Can Meet the Demands of Automation: Q&A; With\nJFF\u2019s Maria Flynn ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/maria-flynn-jff-skill-development-and-\ntraining/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nMaria Flynn, CEO of JFF, talks about why skill development is the need of the\nhour.

In lieu of a typical corporate structure, with power concentrated\nat the top, the online shoe retailer would adopt a decentralized system with\n\u201c[no job titles, no managers, no hierarchy](https://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-\ngoing-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/).\u201d\n\nCEO Tony Hsieh was originally inspired by the idea of creating a city-like\nenvironment without central planning. \u201cEvery time a city doubles in size,\nproductivity per resident goes up 15%,\u201d he [has\nsaid](https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/why-tony-hsieh-is-turning-zappos-\ninto-a-city.html). \u201cThe whole system just works, and it\u2019s really resilient and\nflexible\u2014whereas companies see productivity per capita fall as they grow.\u201d He\nsaw holacracy, a new kind of management structure predicated on decision-\nmaking authority being distributed throughout the organization, as the tool to\naccess that kind of resilience and hyper-productivity.\n\nHolacracy is a radical departure from the way most companies are run. Its\nadoption can be disorienting, even for people who already buy into the\nphilosophy behind the idea. In March 2015, Hsieh [gave employees an\nultimatum](https://qz.com/370616/internal-memo-zappos-is-offering-severance-\nto-employees-who-arent-all-in-with-holacracy/) to either fully commit to being\na genuine participant in Zappos\u2019s holacracy or leave; [18% took a generous\nbuyout offer](https://qz.com/590632/zappos-has-now-lost-18-of-its-employees-\nto-its-radical-buyout-offer/).\n\nBut in the last few years, Zappos has been quietly moving away from holacracy.\nIt has done away with its at-times rigidly (and ironically) bureaucratic\nmeetings and brought back managers, while retaining its circular hierarchy, a\nkey artifact of holacracy.\n\nZappos executive John Bunch, who co-led the rollout of holacracy, [has\nexplained](https://www.workforce.com/2019/03/29/qa-with-john-bunch-holacracy-\nhelps-zappos-swing-from-job-ladder-to-job-jungle-gym/) that the company,\nfamous for its [exceptional customer\nservice](https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/retail/zappos-customer-\nservice-stories-calls-1202778070/), encountered some \u201cbig challenges\u201d in its\nbusiness metrics and sought to redirect employees\u2019 focus back to the customer\n(an oft-cited [criticism of\nholacracy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/01/15/making-sense-\nof-zappos-and-holacracy/#602fee253207) is that it is too internally focused).\nBy March 2017, the e-retailer had shifted its strategy to remedy this.\n\nThe solution? A marketplace system where teams operate like small businesses\nand manage their own profit-and-loss statements, rather than focusing on the\nscope of their holacratic authority to manage the company\u2019s full P&L.;\n\nAccording to company sources, the internal small businesses are incentivized\nto develop new product lines and services for Zappos\u2019s customers. They\ntransact with one another at market rates, similar to the way they\u2019d transact\nwith the outside world. The bet is that market incentives, the resulting\nallocation of resources, and value-creation signals (e.g., profit) will more\neffectively help Zappos innovate\u2014and that the costs added by internal\nnegotiations, competition, and self-direction will be outweighed by the\nbenefits of speed, innovation, scalability, and adaptability.\n\nIt\u2019s still a decentralized system, encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit and\nhigh degree of self-sovereignty. But it isn\u2019t pure holacracy. Rather, the shoe\nretailer has chosen to chart a slightly different course\u2014albeit still in\nservice of the principle of self-organization and that city-like atmosphere\nthat Hsieh originally envisioned.\n\n\u201cMost other companies, the CEO is saying, \u2018Here I\u2019m going to go approve these\nnext 100 businesses to launch,\u2019\u201d Hsieh[ told employees at a Zappos\nconference](https://vimeo.com/335934592/2516a53cd5) last April. \u201cAnd all the\nresearch has shown that top-down approach doesn\u2019t scale well and doesn\u2019t work\nwell for the long term. That\u2019s part of going on this decentralized, self-\norganization path we\u2019re going on. Really, whoever is closest to the customers\nshould be making those choices and decisions.\u201d\n\nZappos executives declined to respond to interview requests. But sources with\nknowledge of the company\u2019s strategy say that under Zappos\u2019 market-based\nsystem, employees earn their budgets by selling their skills and services to\neach other and directly to external customers. Even teams not typically\nfocused on near-term profit, such as research and development, are\nincentivized to find a high-level sponsor or client to fund their expenses.\nThis is quite different from an earlier era at Zappos, in which teams pitched\nthe finance committee and secured annual budgets. That process didn\u2019t always\nincentivize employees to be particularly cost-conscious.\n\n## Inspired by AWS\n\nSince Zappos began rolling out holacracy in 2013, the company has reorganized\ninto 460 team \u201ccircles\u201d and 4,700 roles. The numbers are fluid, though;\ncircles are created and disbanded depending upon the company\u2019s needs at any\ngiven moment. And the 20-year-old company\u2019s big need these days, according to\nHsieh, is to differentiate itself.\n\n\u201cPeople can only wear so many shoes, the market is only so big,\u201d he said in\nApril, likening opportunities for Zappos to broaden its service offerings to\nthe way Amazon branched out from bookselling to cloud computing and built its\n[thriving](https://qz.com/1539546/amazon-web-services-brought-in-more-money-\nthan-mcdonalds-in-2018/) Amazon Web Services arm. Hsieh asked employees to\nenvision what it might look like to provide a suite of Zappos-branded services\nto entrepreneurs, providing everything from legal support to web analytics.\n\u201cAWS has allowed a lot of startups to come out of nowhere and scale quickly,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cImagine if Zappos provided 900 of those services.\u201d\n\nTo help employees vet and build out their ideas, Zappos provides an internal\n\u201c48-hour founders\u201d service that includes coaching, mentoring, and education\nbased on the principles of [lean-startup\nmethodology](https://work.qz.com/work/1132506/lean-startup-evangelist-eric-\nries-on-how-big-companies-can-stay-competitive/). Promising ideas receive\n$5,000 in seed funding. The hope is that a year from now, the company will\nhave many new lines of business.\n\n\u201cIf every circle by the end of 2020 increases revenue by 5% more than what it\nis now, without increasing expenses, that\u2019s $100 million to the bottom line\nfor the company,\u201d Hsieh explained in April at the Zappos conference. \u201cThat\u2019s\nvery doable for everyone.\u201d\n\n## Still ahead of the curve\n\nAlthough Zappos\u2019 pursuit of self-organization has been non-linear and even\n[chaotic at times](https://qz.com/317918/holacracy-at-zappos-its-either-the-\nfuture-of-management-or-a-social-experiment-gone-awry/), the company is still\nahead of the curve, providing others with a model for what works and what\ndoesn\u2019t, under different conditions\u2014notably for its parent company Amazon,\nwhich appears to regard Zappos as an incubator of sorts for new management\npractices.\n\nThe academic community is taking notice as well. In 2017, Harvard Business\nSchool professor Amy Edmondson and researcher Michael Y. Lee (now an assistant\nprofessor of organizational behavior at INSEAD) published a[\npaper](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53193) exploring the\nlimits of hierarchical organizations and the \u201crecent surge in interest in\nless-hierarchical organizing.\u201d Edmondson and Lee highlighted [Zappos as a case\nstudy](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/aimee-groth/the-kingdom-of-\nhappiness/) and pointed to the[ influence of\nholacracy](https://qz.com/work/1397516/is-holacracy-the-future-of-work-or-a-\nmanagement-cult/) in particular.\n\nToday, several hundred organizations operate as holacracies.

Edraw is here to\nhelp you build professional-looking diagrams.\n\n[ ![Donovan Alexander ](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/08MZdU01VcDK_thumb.jpg)\n](https://interestingengineering.com/author/donovan-alexander)\n\nBy  [Donovan Alexander ](https://interestingengineering.com/author/donovan-\nalexander)\n\nJuly 24, 2019\n\n![Build and Visually Shape Your Ideas with This Intuitive and Fun to Use\nSoftware](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/7qOYpMkVw3/sizes/edraw5_resize_md.jpg)\n\n[Edraw](https://www.edrawsoft.com/education.php)\n\n\"Thou shalt have great diagrams and charts in your presentation.\" This has\nbecome the unspoken law of the land when it comes to presentations. Think\nabout it. The right colorful diagram can not only easily convey an idea but\ncan help better engage the audience you are presenting to that day.\n\nWhether it was at school, working on your first presentation or as a junior at\nyour first job at an agency, you probably learned very quickly that great\npresentations need strong visuals; too many words can be an immediate turn-\noff; we can't help it, we are visual creatures.\n\nIf you are a veteran in the game, you know that the right colorful chart or\nvisual can take even the most mundane idea and make it exciting. If you have\nnot picked up on it already, diagrams serve specific purposes in the realms of\nboth the classroom and the corporate world.  \n\n**[RELATED: THIS PDF EDITING TOOL MAKES THE JOB SIMPLE AND EASY WITH ITS MANY\nFEATURES](https://interestingengineering.com/this-pdf-editing-tool-makes-the-\njob-simple-and-easy-with-its-many-features)**\n\nFirst and foremost, diagrams help communicate the big picture, secondly, the\nright creative visuals help communicate the essence of your ideas, communicate\nthe complexity of a concept, and finally make a process or goal more tangible\nfor both an audience and even for you. So, now you want to add a few\nimpressive diagrams in your presentation, but how does one bring that vision\nto life?\n\nRecently, we came across [Edraw Max](https://www.edrawsoft.com/edraw-\nmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\non the search for a program that could add a little flash to some of our\npresentations. Unfortunately, not all of us are graphically inclined or let\nalone have the time or energy to create the perfect flow chart, infographic,\nor floor plan for a presentation, let alone have the time. Yet, [Edraw\nMax](http://bit.ly/2y1O4oJ) stepped up to assist those of us who are\ngraphically impaired, or just too busy.\n\n## Getting Introduced to Edraw Max\n\nFor the uninitiated, [Edraw Max](https://www.edrawsoft.com/edraw-\nmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\nis a cross-platform diagram software for the creation of flow charts, mind\nmaps, organizational charts, network diagrams, and floor plans with an\nextensive gallery of templates, and icons.\n\nHow extensive? Upon opening Edraw Max, you can find 260 plus diagrams to help\nbring your vision to life; literally, almost anything that you can think of\nacross a host of presentation scenarios.\n\nAvailable for [Windows](https://www.edrawsoft.com/download-\nedrawmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink),\n[Mac](https://www.edrawsoft.com/download-edrawmax-\nmac.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink),\nand even [Linux](https://www.edrawsoft.com/download-edrawmax-\nlinux.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink),\nthis was the first thing we noticed upon opening the software. You are\nminimally greeted by the software's host of choices for your set task. There\nare colorful, professional-looking templates that are themed, ranging from\nengineering to industrial automation, science and, even a fashion theme.\n\n## Getting Well-Acquainted with Edraw Max\n\n![Build and Visually Shape Your Ideas with This Intuitive and Fun to Use\nSoftware](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/7qOYpMkVw3/sizes/edraw3_resize_md.jpg)\nSource:\n[_Edraw_](https://www.edrawsoft.com/?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\n\nLike other Wondershare products, [Edraw Max](https://www.edrawsoft.com/edraw-\nmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\nis minimally presented and is relatively easy to navigate. At first, it was a\nbit overwhelming, as there are tons of options for both templates and icons as\nwell as the countless ways you can edit your diagram.\n\nHowever, this is nothing like photoshop, where you will need to spend\ncountless hours or learning all the tips and tricks just to knock out basic\ntasks and get the most out of the program.\n\nPut it this way, if you have ever used anything in the Microsoft Office Suite\nor in Google Documents you will easily be able to navigate your way through\nthe software and use it with ease. Nevertheless, just like these programs,\nthere is a lot of hidden depth to the Edraw Max program. Even more so, if you\nneed a little push, Edraw has a host of tutorials on youtube to get you\nstarted.\n\n>  \n>\n>  \n>\n>  \n>\n> View this post on Instagram\n>\n> [#Edraw comparison #infographic template An infographic to analyze the late\n> night sleep.

Though there are other competitors in\ntown, Edraw Max is a direct competitor to Visio. However, upon using both\nEdraw Max left a better impression on us, giving us the feeling that we have\nmore options for our presentations on hand.\n\n![Build and Visually Shape Your Ideas with This Intuitive and Fun to Use\nSoftware](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/7qOYpMkVw3/sizes/edraw2_resize_md.jpg)\nSource:\n[_Edraw_](https://www.edrawsoft.com/?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\n\nEven more so, we definitely appreciate Edraw Max's UI much more and believe it\nis better suited for the average everyday user, yet it retains just enough\ndepth that anyone transitioning over from Visio would be more than satisfied.\n\nNevertheless, another attractive feature of [Edraw\nMax](https://www.edrawsoft.com/edraw-\nmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\nis the fact that it is fully integrated into Microsoft Office. This allows you\nto take your amazing creations and easily add them to drawings. Nevertheless,\ndo not worry, you can easily add or share your diagram to a host of\npresentation platforms.\n\nNow when we say that there is a host of features for just about everybody, we\nmean it. Edraw Max offers full vector graphics solutions to users, real-time\npreviews, 2000+ clip art, excellent hyperlink support, simple drag and drop\ncapabilities, auto object alignment and a sleek easy to use interface just to\nname a few.\n\n##  Diving Further into Edraw Max\n\nEdraw Max is comprised of Edraw Infographic, Org Charting, Edraw Project, P&ID\nDesigner,  Floor Plan Maker, Edraw Online Viewer, and Office Viewer Component.\nEach of these serves a very specific purpose. With each tool, you can create\ninfographics, build data-interactive organizational charts, manage and track\nyour projects, choose the right symbols, create a floor plan and share files,\nrespectively.\n\n![Build and Visually Shape Your Ideas with This Intuitive and Fun to Use\nSoftware](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/7qOYpMkVw3/sizes/edraw_resize_md.jpg) Source:\n[_Edraw_](https://www.edrawsoft.com/?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\n\nAnother one of our favorite features is Mind Map Maker. Probably structuring\nyour ideas is just as important as presenting them, offering you a good amount\nof clarity. Mind Map Maker also offers a host of icons, 22 layout options, 33\ndesigns, and well over 700 stylish clip arts, the perfect tool when knocking\nout ideas.\n\n> Is 5G really coming?

Speaking of the price Edraw Max offers a host of options for students,\nprofessionals, and corporations. Prices are based on what you want from the\nprogram as well as the number of licenses that you may want.\n[Prices](https://www.edrawsoft.com/orderedrawmax.php?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\nstart at $99.95 for just one license while if you need 100+ licenses they will\ncost you $74.95 each.\n\n## **The Verdict**\n\n![Build and Visually Shape Your Ideas with This Intuitive and Fun to Use\nSoftware](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/7qOYpMkVw3/sizes/edraw1_resize_md.jpg)\nSource:\n[_Edraw_](https://www.edrawsoft.com/?utm_source=media_referral&utm_medium=interestingengineering&utm_campaign=Edrawsoft_max_backlink)\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed exploring all the potential ways Edraw Max could better\nour idea creation process as well as exploring those ways these ideas could be\npresented. The software is perfect for students looking to make an impression\non a final project, and the agency looking to make the right impression on a\nclient.  \n\n In short, the tools and features offered in the Edraw Max are more than\nenough to tackle any task at hand. Even more so, you are going to have a hard\ntime trying to beat that price, as some similar programs are not only less\ninitiative but can cost a small fortune if you are not a business.\n\nEdraw Max is intuitive, and dare we say fun to use. Not only will it save you\na lot of time, but also a fair share of money. Yes, there is a bit of a\nlearning curve, but once everything kicks-in and you start creating, you will\nbe amazed at all the engaging things you can bring to life with the software.\n\nWant to learn more?

He talks about the microcultures that can exist within an\norganization that provide layers of influence in our lives and job\nsatisfaction.\n\n## Bio\n\nMike McGarr currently leads Slack\u2019s Front-end Infrastructure team, focused on\nbuilding a great JavaScript client. Prior to Slack, he lead Netflix\u2019s\nDeveloper Productivity team, who was focused on building tools and services to\nmake engineers at Netflix productive.\n\n## About the conference\n\nSoftware is changing the world. QCon empowers software development by\nfacilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer\ncommunity. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical\nteam leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who\ninfluence innovation in their teams.\n\n## Transcript\n\nMcGarr: I'm going to start off with a bit of a history lesson. In the United\nStates, 1776 is a famous date. This is the date where the Declaration of\nIndependence was signed; the Declaration of Independence was ratified by the\nrepresentatives from 13 different colonies in the United States. This is a\npicture of the Mitchell Map which represents roughly what the United States\nlooked like at the time. Comically, I think it's interesting to see North\nCarolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia's borders extend all the way\nto the West Coast, very optimistic of them, but it took another 136 years to\nadd the next 35 states to the United States after the revolution, and then a\nfurther 47 years to add the final 2. What resulted is what we know and love\ntoday, the United States, a union of 50 separate states. The United States is\none entity in and of itself, but it's also comprised of 50 states.\n\nMyself, I was born in Northern Virginia, specifically Northern Virginia,\nbecause Northern Virginia is very different than Virginia if anyone's ever\nbeen there. I spent a lot of time in Massachusetts, my dad grew up in New\nEngland. He lives on Cape Cod right now, and then we now, currently, my family\nand I, live in California. If you ever traveled around the country, you know\nthat every single state, every single part of the country is different, both\ngeography, climate, but in particular, people. If I go to Texas and meet\nsomeone from Texas, they're wonderful people and they're different than\nsomeone from New York, and so forth and so on.\n\nThis is something we all know, different regions have different people, and\nthey all behave slightly differently. In his book \"American Nations,\" Colin\nWoodard takes a historical look back at the United States, and his perspective\nis that the United States, and North America at large, isn't comprised of 50\nstates, or actually 48 continental states and Canada and Mexico, but he\nbasically says it's comprised of 11 different separate nations. He's applying\nthe Doctrine of First Effective Settlement as the central thesis for the book\nin laying out this claim of these separate nations. What the Doctrine of First\nEffective Settlement says is that the first people who have effectively\nestablished a settlement in a region have an outsized influence on the culture\nof that region in perpetuity, or at least for a long time.\n\nIn this book, he lays out these 11 nations, which are pictured here, and the\norigins of the people, particularly coming from Europe in most of these cases,\nand how they have settled and migrated west, and how those cultural beliefs\nthat they brought with them from Europe still have an impact today in the\nelections and the cultures of these regions. I found this a fascinating\nperspective, but it also struck me that we, as people that work in\norganizations and employees in companies, are also affected by the same thing.\n\nThat's what I want to talk a bit about today. I want to talk about cultures, I\nwant to talk about microcultures, and how we all find our way within this\nworld of cultures and microcultures.\n\n## Why Care?\n\nBefore we begin, I want to make sure that you all understand why culture is a\nvery important thing to talk about, and there's a couple of roles or positions\nyou can think of for talking about culture. First, if you're a leader - and\nwhen I talk about leaders, I'm not just talking about someone like an\nexecutive in an organization, I'm talking about each of us. If you're at QCon,\nI assume that you are a leader or want to be a leader. You want to make a\nchange in your organization and have an influence. Leaders should care about\nculture.\n\nHow many people have heard the term \"culture eats strategy for breakfast?\"\nThere's a term I like even better or phrase from Edgar Schein that says,\n\"Culture determines and limits strategy.\" As a leader, as you're trying to\nimplement strategic initiative in your organization, you have to understand\nthe impact that culture will have on your strategic initiative. Being a visual\nperson, I like pictures, and so I think of culture as a prism, where strategy\ncomes in one way, and then culture is going to shape and warp and break apart\nthat, and the results come out the other. If you're implementing strategy\nwithout considering the cultural impacts to your strategy, you're probably not\ngoing to get the results you want.\n\nLeadership care about culture, employees should also care about culture. Being\na \"Star Wars\" nut, and really I purposely have not started watching \"The\nMandalorian\" yet, but I will tonight, I think of the Force is very similar to\nhow I think about culture. I think about this Obi-Wan Kenobi quote, which is,\n\"It surrounds us, it penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.\" We can\ncoop this quote and change it a little bit for our purposes, \"Culture\nsurrounds us, it penetrates us, and it binds the organization together.\" As\nemployees in an organization, you can't avoid culture. It's something that\naffects every single thing you do every single day. The tools you use, the\nprocesses you use, everything around, everyone in your company is representing\nand is impacted by culture. It is something you cannot avoid. It's just\nsomething you should be paying attention to if you're not already.\n\nAt some point in our careers, we will decide that we want to move from the\ncurrent job into a new job. If you're looking for a job, if you're a job\nseeker, if you're currently on the market or you're thinking about going to\nmarket, you should definitely be thinking about culture. This is something\nthat impacted me recently. As Wes [Reisz] stated, I was at Netflix, and I\ndecided that I was ready for a new challenge. I started looking around for a\nnew job and settled on Slack, and a big part of my decision was interviewing\nSlack from the perspective of culture. I wanted to understand what their\nculture was like and how I could fit and integrate into this culture.\n\nThere's a fourth type of person or role that all of us will often play that is\nimportant for understanding culture, and that is a change agent, someone who's\ngoing to implement a change in an organization. This is a meaty topic, this is\na huge topic. I'm not going to dive deep into the topic of change, but I want\nto make sure that you know that if you're making a change in the organization,\nthe organizational culture is going to resist to any change you try to make. I\nlike to think about culture as having an immune system, the cultural immune\nsystem. It's going to fight back very hard against change. If you're\nimplementing change, you should definitely think about it. This is a different\ntopic, we won't have time to get into it, but it's definitely something that's\nimportant to know.\n\n## What is Culture?\n\nWe all believe culture is important. What is culture? For me, to understand\nculture, it helps to start understanding where culture begins, and culture\nbegins with a problem. There's a problem that exists in the world. This\nproblem is something that, at some point, some person comes across this\nproblem and she says, \"I want to solve this problem, I have a solution to this\nproblem, and I'm going to dedicate a big portion of my life to solving this\nproblem.\" We refer to these people often as founders. Here in Silicon Valley,\nwe hold up founders, but anyone is a founder if you create any organization.\nI've founded two meetups, and I wanted to solve a problem of, no one's talking\nabout these topics in this area. Any of us can be founders, and at some point,\nthese founders, in solving this problem and working on the solution, will say,\n\"I can't do this alone.\" They will recruit people. They're recruiting peers or\nsomebody to help solve this problem. This founder and these people will work\ntogether to try to solve this problem, and over time, hopefully, they will\nfind some measure of success in their solutions.\n\nThis success is actually important to the beginning to understand how culture\nforms, because when I work hard on something and I'm successful, and I reflect\nback on how I was successful, it's the work that I did to get there that I\nwill often say, \"That's why I'm successful.\" As a group, this group will start\nto reflect on why they're successful, and they will start to have these set of\nshared beliefs of why they were successful. This is how culture starts to form\nwithin an organization - these behaviors and the actions they took become this\nset of shared beliefs within the people in the organization. We will often\nrefer to these shared beliefs as values. You've heard of core values, most\ncompanies, at some point, will say, \"We had these sets of core values.\"\n\nThese shared beliefs are key to the formation of a culture, I don't think\nthey're the most important thing we should talk about. Values are important,\nbut I think behavior is even more important. The reason I think behavior is\nimportant is because behavior is derived from values. My actions, the reason\nI'll do something is because I believe I should do something, or I should\nbelieve I should act in a certain way. It's not that behaviors are more\nimportant than values, but they're more visible, and they're easy for us to\nobserve, and they're reflective of the culture.\n\nOrganizations, over time, with these set of shared beliefs, will start to\nthink about the behaviors they want to have as part of their organization and\nthe behaviors that they don't want. These behaviors, both good and bad, that\nthe organization wants will fall in a spectrum. We think, on the spectrum,\nbehaviors on the right will be good, behaviors on the left will be bad.\nWhenever we join an organization, a new company, a new team, we will often\nseek out the set of expected behaviors, \"What are the things that's expected\nfrom me?\" You'll look to your boss and you'll say, \"What do you want me to do?\nWhat do you expect me to be successful?\" If you do these things, you will be a\nsuccessful member of the team. In addition to that, there's a set of rewarded\nbehaviors, \"What are the things that I can do to get ahead, promotion, get\nincreased pay, get kudos?\" We're always seeking these out, these rewarded\nbehaviors. Every culture has a slightly different definition of what's\nexpected and rewarded.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we have punishable behaviors, \"What will get\nme punished if I do these behaviors,\" and these can be anything from getting\non a PIP, performance improvement plan, to getting me fired. Then, there's a\nfourth category, a category of behaviors that we often don't talk about, and\nit's a part of culture, and it's arguably one of the most important parts of\nculture because it's very nefarious. It can be very influential, and this is\nthe tolerated or accepted behaviors. These are the behaviors that maybe no one\nis aware of, they don't talk about it, and it's not something positive, but\nyou don't want it to be part of your company. We've all been in a conversation\nin a group where someone said an off-colored joke, and then you look around\nand everyone's awkwardly laughing, and no one says anything. This is an\nexample of tolerated behaviors. This can be part of the organizational\nculture.\n\nCulture is people sharing beliefs and defining the behaviors that they want,\nbut there's more to it. There are two more things I want to talk about that\nare part of culture. Something we're all familiar with is process. How many\npeople here love process? As my friend Roy Rappaport says, \"How many people\nlike getting paid?\" There's a process for getting paid. Process isn't a bad\nthing, but we often resist it. There's a level of necessary process.\nProcesses, you can think about them as organizational behaviors that you want\nto be repeated over and over again, or you want them to be consistent. We like\ngetting paid, so hopefully, there's a process somewhere that defines how to\nget paid.\n\nProcesses end up being part of a culture, and the processes that are maybe\nonerous or you want to be very consistent and repeatable, we further\nindoctrinate into the culture using tools. We either build these tools or buy\nthese tools, but the tools become part of the culture. Our evolving and\ngrowing definition of culture is, people have values, values dictate\nbehaviors, organizations are founded by people, organizations hire people,\norganizations develop values, organizations reward and punish behaviors,\norganizations lean on processes for these behaviors, and then they simplify\nthese processes with tools. This is not a very easy definition to remember.\nLike I said earlier, I think I'm a simple human. I don't understand this, but\nI can understand this.\n\nThis is my personal view of what culture is, and these are the same components\nof culture stacked up together. We'll come back to this picture again for\nreference. I think all these components are important, but if I were to tab\none takeaway from this talk, it is that culture is really best encapsulated\nwith behavior. All these things in this previous slide are either behavior can\nreflect or are a reflection of behavior in the organization.\n\n## Finding Your Way\n\nWe have a shared definition of culture. We only need to find now our way\nthrough cultures. We need to find a culture we like or understand the culture\nwe're in. The first thing each of us needs to do, which I'm just going to\nencourage you to do and not tell you how to do, is you need to figure out what\nkind of culture you really like. What are the behaviors in the current\norganization you're in or previous organizations that you're in that you\nthought were great and you wish more people in your current organization or\npeople in your future organization would instill or act like? This is\nsomething that is very different for each of us, and each of us needs to go\nthrough this journey and this personal conversation.\n\nOnce you understand that, then you can come back to this definition of\nculture, and you can start looking for these components, the tools, and\nprocesses, behaviors, and values. Especially if you're interviewing,\nespecially when you're not part of the organization, there's a problem. Some\nof these things are invisible to us. My values are invisible to everyone in\nthis room. My behaviors are slightly visible. You see I'm up here pacing\nslowly - maybe awkwardly, I don't know how you feel about this - but I can\ntalk about maybe the process and tools, and I'm person, so you can see me, I'm\ntangible. Organizations, understanding culture, it's very challenging because\nthere are parts that are invisible.\n\nTo get a better handle on culture, we need to lean on something else, which\nare artifacts. Cultures all have artifacts, just like archaeology. An\narchaeologist can look at a dig site in Ancient Greece and find a bowl, and\nthey can use that artifact to understand that culture, or at least a bit about\nthat culture. Artifacts are tangible representations of a culture, but the\nproblem with artifacts is they're only hints. You can't depend on that bowl\nfrom Ancient Greece to give a complete comprehensive story about what happened\nin that day or how people behaved in Ancient Greece. When we start talking\nabout artifacts and cultural artifacts, we need to think about them as\nsomething that will give us hints and give us a piece of this larger picture\nabout the culture. There's lots of artifacts we could talk about. There are\nthree artifacts I want to talk about today, language, leaders, and tools.\n\nLet's start off with language. We go back to our example of the United States.\nThe United States has a language. In fact, it has a document with this\nlanguage written down, and this document is the U.S. Constitution. After its\nformation, we wrote the Constitution, and we had representatives agree and\nsign and ratify, some signatures were larger than others. This document is\nessential to the operation of our government, and it helps us define those\nstate lines that are invisible and intangible. We all agree that those lines\nexist. This Constitution is a great example of a document or language for the\norganization of the United States. What about your organizations?\n\nOrganizations have their own language. I want to give you a quiz, and I think,\nfor QCon, this first question is going to be very easy. I'm going to throw up\nthere a phrase that's used by a company, and you can tell me which company\nuses this phrase. The first one's going to be easy. \"Freedom and\nresponsibility.\"\n\nParticipant 1: Netflix.\n\nMcGarr: All right. This is a phrase from Netflix, this is part of Netflix's\nculture. I'm going to give you another one. \"Have backbone, disagree and\ncommit.\"\n\nParticipant 2: Amazon.\n\nMcGarr: Wow, even faster. This one's usually the one that people don't always\nget initially, but this is a phrase used at Amazon. Why I'm talking about\nthese two phrases is, both \"freedom and responsibility\" and \"have backbone,\ndisagree and commit\" are examples of behavioral heuristics, and I think\nbehavioral heuristics are an important part of the organizational culture's\nlanguage. These heuristics provide employees and individuals in this\norganization guidance on how to act in the absence of clear direction from a\nmanager. In the example of \"have backbone, disagree and commit,\" knowing that\nthat short pithy statement is part of the culture, knowing that you're\nexpected to do this, and that, in the absence of clear guidance, if you just\nact in that way, you'll be deemed successful by the peers in the organization,\nthe leaders in the organization, is very powerful. I find these behavioral\nheuristics are a very powerful way for organizations to indoctrinate and\ninstill their culture.\n\nWhat I also love is that, in the examples of both Amazon and Netflix, and\nthey're not the only ones who do this, they have been explicit enough to put\nthese documents on their Careers page. The one on the left is the Netflix\nculture document, the one on the right Amazon's 12 leadership principles. This\nallows us, as potential employees to these organizations, to go to their\nwebsite and self-select whether this is for me or not. I can look at Amazon's\nleadership principles and be, \"Yep,\" or \"Nope, not going there,\" and that's\nvery powerful. In the case of Netflix, the only version of this document was\nthe one that everyone else saw publicly, which is also, I think, very\npowerful. I think these two documents represent the explicit nature of a\nculture, so the culture is very explicit in its understanding of itself, and\nit enables consistency in how the culture is applied internally.\n\nWe can think about the strength of a culture in these two axes. If you'll bear\nwith me, I'm toying with this idea of trying to represent strength on these\ntwo axes, whereas one axis, you can say how explicit or unknown, so an\nexplicit culture versus unknown, and then how consistently it's applied. What\nI mean consistently is, if I go to someone in accounting and I go to someone\nin engineering, if I go somewhere in marketing, they all understand the\nculture and they all will say the same things. Potent cultures are able to\nhave consistency throughout the organization with an explicitness applied to\nit. Explicit cultures that have a lot of variety I'm labeling anemic cultures.\nI haven't thought really about what kind of culture would be consistent yet no\none knows what the culture is. I think it's an interesting thought exercise,\nbut I definitely think parts of the internet are chaotic, and they would fall\ninto that category of chaotic cultures. Language is an important part of\nenabling consistency, and I think companies that are able to be very explicit\ncan help drive consistency in their culture, and so that has huge, tremendous\nbenefits.\n\nIf I'm interviewing for culture, how do I go about interviewing? I took this\npicture when I was visiting the Twilio office, and they have their culture\nthrown up there on the poster, which is another example of explicit culture\nbut also sharing it with employees so that everyone gets the same\nunderstanding. I want to show some questions that I've used to understand\ninterview for culture. The first one is \"Describe your culture,\" which sounds\nvery simple, but if you do this, if you go back to your organization, and if\nyour organization does not have explicit culture, and you ask 10 people, 20\npeople, describe the culture, and especially if you start going outside of\nyour organization, you start talking to people outside of your team, you might\nbe surprised at how inconsistent the answer is. Having done this a few times,\nit's a fascinating exercise, it's worth doing, and that will help gauge how\nconsistent your culture is.\n\n\"How do employees know what to do?\" This one sounds a little vague, but how do\nI know when I'm acting in meeting expectations with the organization, the\npeople in my organization? Do I look at the career ladder? Do I look at some\nother document? Where do I go to understand when I'm doing a good job? Then,\nthis one is a complement of my friend, Nora Jones. She was trying to teach me\nthat the best way to understand a culture is when a culture's in crisis, so\nask somebody to describe the last time your site went down and what happened\nand how the company acted. This is language.\n\nLet's talk a bit about leaders. When I talk about leaders, I'm talking about\npeople with influence, not necessarily just title. We talked a bit about\npeople with influence, we've talked about founders. If you're to believe that\nthe Doctrine of First Effective Settlement can be applied to your\norganizations, then founders have an outsized influence on the future culture\nof the organization. How many people have seen this org chart caricature,\npicture? This was a cartoon that stuck around the internet for probably 5, 10\nyears. I love this caricature, because not only does it talk about org charts\nof companies, but it's very reflective of the culture of the company through\nthe org chart.\n\nWhat's also interesting if you look very carefully, in most of these charts,\nit's also representing how the founders/leaders of these organizations fit\ninto the culture and the org chart. It's easy to see how the founders of these\norganizations have had an outsized influence on the future culture of these\norganizations. I think founders are the first place you should look to\nunderstand how a culture can involve and does involve, especially in the case\nof those founders that I just showed, but people managers are also extremely\nimportant. In fact, when you're forming a new team and you're hiring a new\nleader for that team, that new leader for that team is effectively the founder\nof that team.\n\nThe same principles apply in that, when you hire somebody or a new leader\ncomes in, and they're going to form a team, their own biases, their own\nbeliefs are going to be applied to how that team is going to be built, how\nit's going to be hired, how you're going to let people go. These are the roles\nof people managers. They're going to hire and they're going to reward based on\ntheir own biases. They're going to fire people based on their own biases. In\nfact, there's a quote I love by Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos, which is,\n\"The most important people to your culture are those that leave.\" I think this\nis extremely true; if you want to understand the culture, look at all the\npeople that have left the culture and ask them, especially if they're either\ninvoluntarily or voluntarily, and you can understand some of the challenges\nthat culture might be having.\n\nI think one of the other important things that people managers end up doing\nfor the culture is they model behavior. No matter what level you're in, the\nway a manager acts essentially giving approval to everybody else that this is\nhow you should act, \"this is what I expect of you.\" As a manager myself, I\nthink about that a lot, my behavior will often be seen as this is what's\naccepted in the organization. I think it's extremely important for managers to\ntake that lesson home, which is modeling behavior is one of the most important\nthings you could do.\n\nWithin organizations, we can draw our own org charts. We saw some caricatures\nof org charts. This is an org chart I drew of a fictitious company. If there's\nany similarity to your org chart, it is purely accidental. If we look at an\norg chart, we can draw some conclusions based on just the org structure alone\nof an organization. You can look at the CEO, and they could see how he or she\nis aligned by six different C-levels. The names of the C-levels might be\nimportant, like the fact they chose a chief people officer versus some other\ntitle. Those are interesting, but what's more interesting is the fact that\neach of these individual leaders will in turn, over time, drive cultural\ninfluences down within their org based on their own beliefs and effectively\ncreate their own subcultures. Each leader will have an outsized influence on\nthe evolution of the culture of that org.\n\n## Microcultures\n\nThis is where we start talking about microcultures. This is the cultures that\nform within your organization that look and start feeling a little separate.\nEveryone has them, they all exist. They're not necessarily a problem, but you\nshould be aware that they exist, especially when you start talking to\ndifferent people in the organization. Be aware of where they're situated\nwithin the organization and what domain they're in, because that will have an\ninfluence on their perspective on how the business is run and how the\norganization is operating. What's interesting about microcultures is, often\nwhen you're in a microculture, you can feel like you're in a whole separate\ncompany. There have been teams that I'd been on where I've been sitting there,\nworking very hard, because the directives and the guidance from my manager is,\n\"We need to solve X problem. That's the most important thing for the company.\"\nThen, I meet somebody two orgs over, and their guidance from their managers is\ncompletely different, and it's almost like we're driving to different\ninitiatives.\n\nWhat kind of microculture will a leader create? It's an interesting question.\nWe look at the leader, they're going to create and influence the culture of\nthat organization, of that team. How do we understand how they're going to\ninfluence that, especially if you want to go work for in that org? I think one\nplace to look is history. Where have they been, what have they done, and what\nhave they said is a great way to understand, at least get a hint. It's another\nartifact as to how that leader will influence the org.\n\nWe can take me as an example. Wes [Reisz] gave a brief overview of my history,\nwe talked about it a bit. I'm actually a history major, CS came later for me,\nand I did 11 years Federal contracting, and I have the scars to prove it. I\nthen spent a year and a half doing DevOps at a company called Blackboard, and\nthen I spent four and a half years of doing developer productivity at Netflix.\nJust yesterday was my one-year anniversary at Slack doing frontend\ninfrastructure. A lot of you are already starting to draw conclusions about\nwhat type of manager I am based on this. I will say that my peers at Slack\nhave had to tolerate me talking about Netflix way too much, and I've had to\nlearn to stop. I think that's important, because spending enough time at\nNetflix with a very potent culture and leaving and going someplace else, I\nbrought with me a whole set of biases that weren't just my own, but I was\ncarrying with me this influence of this Netflix culture.\n\nNow that I've had this reflection and look at how I've acted and where my\nbiases are, I've started changing, \"Ok, I'm not going to try to make Slack in\nthis way,\" but actually trying to say, \"What does Slack need to be, and what\nlessons can I take from my experiences to apply at Slack?\" I'm also giving\nfeedback to other leaders who come in from another company and try to recreate\ntheir organization. We've all worked with people who have come from a company,\n\"At my previous company, I did this.\" Those are valuable, but not too much of\nit.\n\nWe talked about language and leaders. The last thing I want to talk about is\ntools. Tools, I purposely put at the top of this pyramid, because tools are\nthe most visible but also the weakest signal we can have towards culture.\nTools are easy to find because you can go to any companies, GitHub repo, we\ncan look at any of the talks that have happened at this conference and\nunderstand the tools that each company is using to be successful in their job.\nThere's a lot of tools we can look at. I want to focus on one tool in\nparticular that I find particularly interesting, which is programming\nlanguages.\n\nMost of us here are programmers, and most of us have grown up on one language,\nand some of us have written code in multiple languages. We've learned - or\nsome of us have learned - that over time, these programming languages have\nthings we like and things we don't like. We can take, for example, a language\nthat I've used a lot, Java and Ruby. Java is a language that was statically\ntyped and has suffered from poor stewardship for a period there where it\ndidn't evolve. Now, it's getting much better and it's catching up, which is\ngreat. I'm very excited about it. It's a fast scalable system that's\nenterprise-grade, and big systems are built on it. Ruby, on the other hand, is\na dynamically-typed language. The culture around Ruby is one of developer\nhappiness, which, as a Java developer, seemed very foreign to me. I say that\nwith love for Java. It had a lot of C-bindings, which was a surprise when I\nstarted playing with Ruby. Synonymous with Rails - Rails was this huge product\nthat propelled Ruby into the four, and a lot of TDD is part of their culture.\n\nBoth these languages are interesting because they were custom-built for a\npurpose, they're good at certain things, and they're not good at other things.\nAs a result of these enablers and these constraints, these tools have evolved\nand have built communities around them. A Java developer often will look at a\nRuby developer, and they're not just looking at the language themselves, but\nthey're looking at the ecosystem of open-source tools, the philosophies that\nthat language has built around it, and those culture around those communities.\nI think this is a very important perspective to keep, especially when we, in\norganizations, are choosing languages to use. If we go back to our org chart,\nhow many believe have seen their company's language use look something like\nthis, where you have different languages being used by all over the company?\n\nThis, by itself, is not necessarily a problem, but if you think about the\nperspective of, say, in this example here, the CTO is a Java developer and\nbelieves in Java and wants to push Java, and you have the beliefs of the Java\necosystem, the beliefs of the Java community are going to seep into his org.\nWhereas the CISO over is a Rubyist and believes in Ruby and believes in the\ncultures of that language community that are also going to be hired into your\norganization. Programming languages can have this interesting influence on the\nculture because they actually pull in their own culture into your\norganization. Go is a particularly interesting one because I have never worked\nin a mono-repo, but Go, the ecosystem of Go itself is very reflective of\nGoogle's mono-repo culture. You can see these tensions there. I've experienced\nexamples where deployment strategies have been a source of contention between\ndifferent language users, because one language has evolved separately their\nown deployment strategy and then another language is building a deployment\ntool that applies a different deployment strategy. You could see these\nprogramming languages can create tension within the organization.\n\nSome companies will accommodate this through their structure. I don't know if\nanyone's ever seen Spotify's culture video, it's a very interesting look at\nhow one company has decided to indoctrinate their culture. One thing I\nappreciate about their culture video is they talk about how it's not just\ncomplete, but it's aspirational. Here, you can see that they formalized these\nstructures called Squads, which are the verticals, and these Squads are teams,\nand they're part of a Tribe, but they also have these horizontal structures\ncalled Chapters and Guilds that accommodate these different language and\ndomain expertise. I think it's a valuable part of tools or a valuable part of\nthe culture to accommodate this within their organizational structure.\n\nThe takeaway for me is, you can look at tools as this tool is good at one\nthing, it's not good in other, and it enables and constrains the behaviors of\nthe people within that organization. You could start to see how it will\ninfluence behavior. I wasn't going to talk about change, but one of my\nfavorite techniques for implementing change in organization is actually to\nreplace one tool that works fine with another tool that works fine, and what\npeople will do is say, \"This new tool means I have to do something different,\"\nand you tell them, \"You have to use a new process,\" and that enables new\nbehavior and effectively can create new beliefs. It's a little hack you can\nimplement.\n\n## Summing It Up\n\nLet's sum it up. Culture - Mike's [McGarr] definition, you can believe it or\nnot - is composed of these parts of values, people, behavior, process, tools.\nCulture can influence your strategy, so pay attention to it. It's very\nimportant, but the most important part of culture is behaviors, and these\ntypes of behaviors are an important part of your culture. You can look for\nthese various types of microcultures that exist in your organization to\nunderstand how they influence and where you fit into these microcultures.

you ever seen \u2018Job Shop Management 101\u2019 taught in any college or\nuniversity? I\u2019m betting not.\u201d\n\nSo said Vincent Bozzone, president and founder of Delta Dynamics, a Michigan-\nbased consultancy long known to many in the job shop world. Bozzone is the\nauthor of Speed to Market: Lean Manufacturing for Job Shops, a book focused on\nrefining job shop operations to shorten lead time, the order-to-cash cycle.\nStill, Bozzone conceded that this and his other previously published works\nhaven\u2019t delved deeply into the job shop management structure.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018theory of job shops,\u2019\u201d Bozzone continued, adding that no one in\nacademia or much of the management consulting world really has dissected the\njob shop business model in a serious way.\n\nWhen you think about just how complex custom fabrication job shops truly are,\nit\u2019s no wonder that many of them struggle with on-time delivery. For years the\nannual \u201cFinancial Ratios & Operational Benchmarking Survey\u201d from the\nFabricators & Manufacturers Association has reported on-time delivery rates in\nthe mid-80 percent range. Sure, the annually reported average comes from a\nwide range of responses, and many fabricators do achieve near-perfect on-time\ndelivery rates. But just as many report rates at or below average.\n\nMany job shops grow into organizations that ship hundreds or thousands of\ndifferent parts over a month or year, each with their own demand cycles,\nroutings, and engineering and manufacturing requirements. It all creates a web\nof complexity\u2014but why, exactly? Bozzone attributes at least some of that\ncomplexity to the way most job shops are organized: around function instead of\nthe business process.\n\nSwitching to a process-based organization could be a good first step in real\nchange. Changing the organization chart won\u2019t eliminate all problems, Bozzone\nsaid, but it could help, rather than hinder, the flow of jobs through the\nbusiness.\n\n## A Job Shop Growth Story\n\nAccording to Bozzone, having an organization chart grouped by function is\nwhere those dreaded communication \u201csilos\u201d come from. Say a cutting department\nmanager has a question about material purchasing practices, considering the\nissues he\u2019s experienced on the cutting table. Strictly speaking, the\norganization chart says that he should speak to his supervisor, who then\nshould speak to the manufacturing manager, who then should speak to the\npresident. The president then talks to the purchasing manager (who, again,\nreports to the president, not manufacturing).\n\nCommunications might not be this formal, of course, particularly in the fast-\npaced job shop world. It doesn\u2019t make sense for every tiny purchasing issue to\nbe brought to the president\u2019s attention, though major purchasing issues would\nbe.\n\nOf course, the real issue is that the cutting problem occurred during\nproduction, and it\u2019s creating a speed bump. Flow stops, other jobs are\ndelayed, and the dominoes fall.\n\nTo avoid these problems, many have trumpeted the benefits of \u201cbreaking down\nthe silos.\u201d Managers promote good communications, hold meetings to keep\neveryone in the loop, and more.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382939.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382939.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nThe job shop business process cycle starts with marketing and sales and ends\nwith shipping and receiving payment for a job.\n\nBut Bozzone\u2019s approach goes deeper and tackles the root cause: the\norganization structure itself. What\u2019s wrong with it? As Bozzone explained, it\ndoesn\u2019t consider the actual business processes that define how a job shop\nactually works.\n\nWhat are those business processes? Bozzone illustrates them in a cycle,\nstarting with marketing and sales. \u201cMarketing and sales generate a request for\nquotations, which are estimated and bid upon. The shop either wins them or\nloses them. Typically, you lose a lot more than you win.\u201d\n\nOnce a job is won, some level of engineering can be involved,\u201canything from a\ncouple of sketches to a full-blown engineering design effort.\u201d Next comes\npreproduction, which prepares the job for production (more on this later);\nproduction; and finally shipping.\n\n## The Three Functions of the Order Cycle\n\nThe whole quote-to-cash cycle really can be grouped into three basic\nfunctions: selling and bidding, preparing the won orders for production, and\nproducing and shipping those orders. Bozzone calls these the front end,\npreproduction, and production, respectively. Supporting these three functions\nis an area Bozzone calls \u201cmanagement information, which incorporates finance,\nhuman resources, IT, and office operations.\u201d\n\nIn the early stages of a job shop\u2019s life, one person does the first three and\nat least some of the fourth (though functions like continuous improvement\nwouldn\u2019t be formalized). Then the founder might hire someone\u2014a sheet metal\nguru\u2014to prepare jobs, do a little engineering, and run the machines\n(preproduction and production), but the founder still sells and bids on work\nand manages material purchases (front end), building those customer and\nsupplier relationships that help the business grow.\n\nBut then the order volume grows, and the founder hires more and more people.\nOrders get more complicated, and the number of orders and machines grows. The\nshop hires engineers, estimators, and operators. Before you know it, the shop\nhas a traditional functional structure\u2014which, you might notice, has something\nmissing.\n\n## The Need for Preproduction\n\n\u201cMy bet is that most custom fab shops don\u2019t have a designated preproduction\ndepartment,\u201d Bozzone said, \u201cor even a way to control preproduction activities.\nInstead, the various preproduction tasks are scattered around the\norganization. This is a prime reason for long lead times.\u201d\n\nPreproduction\u2014that process the technical guru took care of on his own when the\nshop was young\u2014eventually becomes diluted. Engineers do a little preproduction\nwork, prepping the CAD drawing so the part can be manufactured on the floor.\nSchedulers might put together a routing through certain machines to take\nadvantage of available capacity.\n\nBut then parts are released to the floor, where the holdups inevitably\nsurface: a press brake setup that just doesn\u2019t work, a weld fixture that\nhasn\u2019t been made, a powder coat that just won\u2019t stick.\n\nSome large fabricators designate a department for prototyping, one-offs, and\nlow-volume nonrepeating work, where engineers and highly skilled machine\noperators and welders work together to make first articles and prepare a job.\nBut the vast majority of shops do not have such a department, and a good many\nsmaller operations don\u2019t have the machines to spare.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382944.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382944.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nAccording to Vincent Bozzone, a traditional functional structure does not\nalign with a job shop\u2019s business processes.\n\nBozzone\u2019s \u201cpreproduction\u201d concept focuses less on part design, which\u2014besides\ndesign tweaks for manufacturability\u2014is usually outside the job shop\u2019s sandbox.\nIt instead takes a broader approach and focuses on developing a production\nplan that includes purchasing and capacity planning, scheduling, programming,\nquality protocols, customer approvals, and developing necessary fixtures and\ntooling setups as well as effective routings. The idea is to make production\nas smooth as it can be.\n\nHe added that, yes, if a job shop needs to develop first articles and test\nparts, it\u2019s ideal for a designated preproduction department to have its own\nmachines, but it\u2019s not entirely needed as long as machine time for\npreproduction is made available in the shop.\n\nAnd preproduction doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make first articles. In fact,\nfor some job shop businesses, a first article would be impractical. Bozzone\ndescribed Max Weiss Co., a job shop in Milwaukee he recently visited. The\ncompany bends and rolls massive beams, pipes, and angle for the construction\nbusiness and OEMs.\n\nRolling cycle time is measured in hours, and one massive piece can cost\nserious money. In this case, he said, preproduction would entail the engineers\nand tooling professionals working together to ensure production goes smoothly,\nthat the first roll goes as quickly and predictably as possible.\n\nBut again, many organization charts place preproduction roles in various\nareas. Purchasing and programming might be in the front office and report to\ntop management. A quality assurance department could devote some of its time\nto preproduction (quality protocols), and some of its time to production,\nchecking production parts to meet customer quality requirements.\n\nA lead operator in the press brake department plays a preproduction role too,\nsetting up jobs to make sure they run correctly. Only he or she is probably\ndoing it after the job has been released to production. If that lead person\nruns into trouble developing a setup and spends hours trying to perfect it,\nthe brake department just lost available capacity for other jobs.\n\n## Align Structure With Process\n\nYes, fabricators could work on developing communication among departments and\nfoster an environment that encourages ownership over the quality of one\u2019s\nwork. Problem is, a job shop\u2019s organizational structure often works against\nthis.\n\nBozzone\u2019s proposed job shop structure aligns with the job shop business\nprocess. A shop could have vice presidents over the front-end processes,\npreproduction, and production, and then organize the related functions\nunderneath.\n\nThe preproduction department could include engineering (which could include\nphysical tryouts of difficult parts), production planning and scheduling,\nmaterials and production scheduling, quality protocols establishment, and\ntraveler release, at which point the baton is handed off to the production\ndepartment.\n\nWhat about support functions like QA, manufacturing support, and maintenance?\nThe exact organization depends on a job shop\u2019s niche and product mix, Bozzone\nsaid; but wherever these support functions are placed, they should support,\nand not work against, the job shop business process.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382950.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382950.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nBozzone proposes a new job shop structure, with front-end, preproduction, and\nproduction departments that align with the shop\u2019s business processes. A\nseparate administration, or \u201cmanagement information,\u201d department\u2014for functions\nlike HR, finance, and IT\u2014would also report to the president. The red text in\nthe bottom chart indicates key metrics.\n\nFor example, some QA techs could be under production, ensuring inspections are\nmade and documented per customer requirements and reporting to the VP of\nproduction. The preproduction department also could employ quality experts who\ndevelop the quality protocols for each job.\n\nA similar arrangement could be made for maintenance functions. Most\nmaintenance personnel would support production and, hence, report to the VP of\nproduction. Meanwhile, if preproduction has separate equipment for job\ntryouts, technicians within the preproduction department could be responsible\nfor their own machine maintenance.\n\nStill, Bozzone emphasized that such divisions should never foster \u201cnot my job\u201d\nmentalities. If a maintenance expert in production knows best how to fix a\npress brake in the preproduction area, he should fix the machine. And he\nshould have the incentive to do so, because the better preproduction does its\njob, the easier production\u2019s job becomes. All this, Bozzone explained, is\nwhere performance metrics come into play.\n\n## The Right Metrics\n\nMetrics and performance reviews would be based on satisfying demand for the\nnext customer in the value chain. That is, they help make life easier for\nthose downstream. This builds the foundation for cross-company communication\nand collaboration. Knowledge is shared. Decision-making occurs quickly.\nProduction gives feedback to preproduction, which gives feedback to the front\nend. If you aren\u2019t giving your customer (internal or external) what he or she\nneeds, your performance suffers.\n\nThose in the production department would be measured based on how well they\nmeet the end customer\u2019s demand. Are deliveries of quality parts made quickly,\nwithin the expected time? Are the dimensions and quantities correct?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old job shop adage,\u201d Bozzone said. \u201c\u2018The longer a job sits on the\nfloor, the more it costs to get it out the door.\u2019\u201d\n\nProduction performance metrics might include percentage of jobs that need\nrework, along with other productivity metrics like dollars shipped per hours\nworked.\n\n\u201cRework is an important metric because it is the most expensive source of\nwaste in any job shop,\u201d Bozzone said. \u201cLook at it this way: First you pay to\nmake it wrong; then you pay to undo what has been made wrong; then you pay\nagain to redo what has been undone; and all the time you are undoing and\nredoing, you have lost capacity that could have been sold. Then you add the\ncost of scrap.\u201d (It\u2019s little wonder Bozzone calls rework \u201cthe Great Satan of\nWaste.\u201d)\n\nPreproduction metrics might include the percentage of shop orders released on\ntime and complete\u2014that is, orders that reach production without anything\nmissing: material, tooling and fixturing, clear and comprehensive setup\ninstructions, and more. The last thing production wants is for preproduction\nto miss something that causes problems in production.\n\n\u201cFor preproduction, releasing orders on time is equally important,\u201d Bozzone\nadded, \u201cbecause when preproduction is delayed and an order is released to the\nshop late, this overloads the shop, creates chaos, and leads to late\ndeliveries. In fact, [late deliveries from production] are often assumed to be\na scheduling problem, when in fact they are not.\u201d\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382955.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382955.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nThe \u201cfront end\u201d would include marketing, sales, estimating, and, in those\nshops with an extended build cycle, project management.\n\nSimilarly, the front end should work to make life easier for preproduction.\nThe faster and more smoothly preproduction can work through job orders, the\nbetter the front end is performing. Sales focuses on the shop\u2019s sweet spot,\nwhere it can be the most competitive, while perhaps, in an effort to diversify\nthe customer base, exploring how that sweet spot could help customers in other\nmarket sectors.\n\n\u201cA danger in job shops is taking orders that do not fit the shop\u2019s\ncapabilities or cannot be delivered by the promised date,\u201d Bozzone said. These\nshould not be quoted, which is difficult to do when the shop is low on work.\n\nWith sales focusing on the shop\u2019s strengths, estimators work with drawings\nthat show parts they know the shop can produce; if they don\u2019t know, or if they\nknow the job might be pushing the envelope for production, they talk with\ntheir internal customers\u2014that is, the experts in preproduction\u2014and work toward\na solution.\n\nKey front-end metrics could include the number of leads generated (including\nrequests for quotation), the percentage of leads that turn into orders and\nbooked business, and the number of new customers.\n\n\u201cNew customers are absolutely critical for job shops,\u201d Bozzone said, \u201cbecause\nthe customer base is continually eroding.\u201d\n\nNote a key metric that hasn\u2019t been mentioned: on-time and on-budget delivery.\nAs Bozzone explained, this is a critical metric for the entire organization,\nbut it cannot be looked at in a vacuum. A job could have flown through\nproduction but still be shipped late, just because it was held up in\npreproduction or front-end processes. So when it comes to performance metrics,\nthe buck for on-time delivery stops not in manufacturing, not in engineering\nor sales, but at the president or chief executive\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job to build an organization that can in fact deliver\nconsistently on time and on budget,\u201d Bozzone said.\n\n## Big-picture Thinking\n\nThis new structure, Bozzone said, gets people away from compartmentalized\nthinking. \u201cIn a functional arrangement, people tend to think about their\nfunction and not how it fits into the overall business process.\u201d\n\nThis new organizational model could change that. Bozzone conceded that\nchanging the organization structure alone won\u2019t make every problem go away.\nBut at least it would align everyone\u2019s job with the job shop business process\nand set the stage for future growth.\n\n_Delta Dynamics\nInc.,[www.deltadynamicsinc.com](http://www.deltadynamicsinc.com),\n[jobshop360.com](http://jobshop360.com)._\n\n__ ![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382960.jpg?size=1000x)\n\nKey metrics for individual departments should support key metrics for the\noverall organization, the most important being delivering on time and on\nbudget (within the estimate).\n\n##### About the Author\n\n### Tim Heston\n\nSenior Editor\n\nFMA Communications Inc.\n\n__\n\n2135 Point Blvd\n\nElgin,  IL 60123\n\n__\n\n815-381-1314\n\n__\n\n[Email Tim Heston](mailto:timh@thefabricator.com \"Tim Heston\")\n\n__\n\n[See More by Tim Heston](/author/tim-heston)\n\n##### About the Publication\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\nmarch-2019-1551111627.jpg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/logos/logo_the-\nfabricator.svg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Read more from this issue](/thefabricator/issues/fab-march-2019 \"Read more\nfrom this issue\")\n\n__\n\n[View the Digital Edition](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the digital\nedition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Subscribe to The FABRICATOR](/subscription/pub/fab \"Subscribe to The\nFABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thefabricator/\n\"Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabricating \"Find The\nFABRICATOR on Twitter\")\n\n##### You May Also Like\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/a-new-business-model-a-new-\nstructure-a-new-business)\n\n#### [A new business model, a new structure\u2014a new\nbusiness](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/a-new-business-model-a-new-\nstructure-a-new-business)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/job-shop-management-are-scheduling-\nproblems-really-symptoms)\n\n#### [Job shop management: Are scheduling problems really\nsymptoms?](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/job-shop-management-are-\nscheduling-problems-really-symptoms)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/how-to-track-success-in-the-job-\nshop)\n\n#### [How to track success in the job\nshop](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/how-to-track-success-in-the-job-\nshop)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/structurally-its-a-job-shop)\n\n#### [Structurally, it's a job\nshop](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/structurally-its-a-job-shop)\n\n#### Get The FABRICATOR updates in your inbox\n\nSign up and be the first to know about the latest industry news, products, and\nevents!\n\nSubscribe\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n  * __\n  * Stay connected from anywhere\n\n  * The FABRICATOR\n  * The Welder\n  * The Tube and Pipe Journal\n  * STAMPING Journal\n  * The Additive Report\n\n[![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\napril-2020-1584633775.jpg)](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the Digital\nEdition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\nNow through June 1, we\u2019re providing full access to the digital edition of _The\nFABRICATOR_.

Keeping together is progress. Working\ntogether is success.\" That iconic quote from the late industrialist Henry\nFord, founder of Ford Motor Company, rings as true now as during his lifetime.\nWhether employees sit on the executive team or work on the front lines,\nrelationships within and beyond a company are vital to workplace success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday's technology-connected workplaces are transforming how relationships\nform by making it faster and easier to share information and influence\nopinions. Even remote employees who don't talk around the proverbial water\ncooler aren't isolated. Chat tools, videoconferencing, and a host of other\napps make it possible to interact, exchange ideas, propose solutions, and\nbuild networks across oceans, departments, and organizations.\n\nThe result is a complex web of relationships that affects organizations.\nEmployers can use these internal networks to propel their business forward\u2014if\nthey take the time to map them, analyze what they find, and match them to the\norganizational strategy. In fact, companies can uncover answers to a broad\nrange of questions that influence key outcomes for individual employees,\nteams, and the organization as a whole.\n\nConsider these questions: Are your company's current (and future) leaders\ncultivating the relationships they need to thrive in a workplace reliant on\nteamwork? Are the right departments working together to meet the\norganization's needs? Are key leaders aligned in support of core strategies\nand change initiatives?\n\nIf any of those questions are relevant to your organization, network analytics\ncan be a strategic tool in the talent development function's arsenal. Network\nanalytics can help you uncover previously hidden employee connections and use\nthem to advance outcomes you care about, such as inclusion, efficiency,\ncollaboration, strategic development, and retention. In addition, a network\nanalysis helps companies visualize connections between employees, teams, and\ndepartments\u2014providing the information leaders need to make informed decisions\nthat maximize results.\n\nAt the individual level, you can see whether employees interact with co-\nworkers equally or whether there are key opinion leaders. At the group level,\nyou can determine whether departments collaborate frequently or operate in\nsilos. You can even examine how well connected your organization is to the\nlocal community or global marketplace. Once you understand these previously\ninvisible connections, you can determine how to work with, rather than\nagainst, the existing flow of information and influence.\n\nThe insights you uncover can help the broader organization address its most\npressing business challenges. Companies across the world have used network\nanalytics to improve efficiency, decrease onboarding time, boost innovation,\nminimize turnover, drive strategy, prepare for disruptive changes, and ensure\nimportant voices are represented in strategic decisions. Employers can stop\nwasting time, energy, and resources on strategies that simply won't work by\nbecoming more informed about how their workplace is connected.\n\nThere are three steps to using network analytics effectively: Gather network\ndata, map and analyze the connections, and leverage network analytics to plan\nstrategy.\n\n## Gather network data\n\nYour starting point is to gather data about who interacts with whom so you can\nmap relationships across the organization. Many companies take a direct\napproach and survey employees about whom they interact with, how often, and\nfor what purpose. You could include questions that explore the quality or\nscope of those relationships, such as whom employees seek out for support,\ninnovative ideas, or career advice. Mapping connections that are most relevant\nfor the organization's challenges will provide the insights your company needs\nto support change.\n\nIndirect data collected without surveys also can prove valuable. For example,\nmap calendar invites, project membership, frequency of email exchanges, and\nrelated interaction data to identify connections.\n\nFor either approach, consider collecting employee information, such as job\ntitle and department, to better understand who is represented in your\ncompany's network. Finally, consolidate the gathered information into a single\nspreadsheet, with a row of data for each employee.\n\nOne important decision point during this data-collection phase is whether the\ncollected information will be confidential or personally identifiable. Rather\nthan identifying specific employees, link their responses to their length of\ntenure or, if relevant, office location and gender. Collecting confidential\ninformation can contribute to greater psychological safety because employees\nare not individually identified in the network maps. Other questions, such as\nidentifying key opinion leaders, require identified data. Be fully transparent\nwith employees about whether you will use personally identifiable data, how\nyou will use it, and why you made that decision.\n\n## Map and analyze the connections\n\nNext, use the collected information to create maps representing the\nrelationships you've uncovered. Quantitative data experts can be a big help\nhere, because they use sophisticated statistical methods to identify patterns\nof connectivity among individuals and across functions, divisions, and\nhierarchies. Your objective is to create an easy-to-follow, visual\nrepresentation of workplace relationships.\n\nWhat does a network map look like? In the figure on page 54, circles represent\npeople and lines represent their relationships. The thinner circles show\nemployees with fewer interactions at work. The thicker circles show the most\nconnected individuals\u2014those who serve as information brokers or opinion\nleaders. They may be in a position to span boundaries and work with various\ngroups across the organization. You can label circles based on characteristics\nof individuals\u2014for example, the colors in the figure may represent which\ndepartment an individual belongs to.\n\nOnce you have your network maps in hand, explore them for insights. The way\nyou make sense of the findings depends on whether you decided to identify\nindividuals. If you gathered personally identifiable information, you'll see\nwho the key players or teams are and how they interact to form cross-boundary\nconnections and centers of influence. For instance, the thicker orange circle\nin the sample network map may be considered a key influencer.\n\nIf you decided against gathering personally identifiable information, focus on\noverarching patterns of connectivity and how work happens across employees,\nteams, and functional boundaries. For example, the sample network map may\nsuggest that the yellow and orange teams collaborate with one another, while\nthe green and light blue teams are more siloed.\n\nTake the time to solicit key stakeholders' and top management teams' reactions\nto your network maps. Ask whether anything stands out and whether they are\nsurprised by the connection patterns. Think through how your findings relate\nto the employee, team, and organizational outcomes that are most important for\nyour company.\n\n## Leverage network analytics to plan strategy\n\nYou can use what you learn from the networks in many ways. For example, you\ncan target training and development efforts to promote collaboration and\nteamwork where it is needed most. Or you can elevate your role by sharing what\nyou learn with executives and functional leaders across the organization;\ntogether you can uncover bottlenecks and encourage purposeful connections that\nmay be missing.\n\nThe uses of network analytics that have the most impact include fostering\nreflection and facilitating change. Many change initiatives underperform\nbecause those leading the charge fail to consider the ways people naturally\nwork and collaborate. However, when organizations take the time to understand\nthe unique patterns of interaction and workflow, they can accelerate change\ninitiatives and help them succeed.\n\nDuring the planning stage for a new change initiative, network analytics can\ninform strategic decisions about program design. If, for instance, an\norganization discovers that there is frequent communication among departments,\nit will likely be easy to align everyone behind important initiatives. Leaders\nmay recommend an organization-wide launch of a change initiative rather than a\nphased rollout. If instead there are high-influence departments or opinion\nleaders who tie together otherwise disconnected groups, it may be wise for\norganization leaders to partner with those influencers to introduce new ideas\nor to gain insights into how receptive or resistant employees will be.\n\nDuring the implementation stage, information about employee connections can\nalso help an organization roll out new strategies, innovation efforts, or\nother changes in a more targeted fashion. Executives launching a new quality\nprocess, for example, can look for employees with close connections within and\nbeyond their departments who can become early adopters (assuming personally\nidentifiable information was collected). To improve a product development\npipeline or grow market share, the appropriate functional teams can assess\nwhether the right groups are interacting to promote innovation and boost\nsales.\n\nOrganizations can even use network analytics to explore why silos may exist.\nFor example, are disconnected teams located in different physical locations?\nIf so, leaders could promote collaboration by facilitating travel between\nsites or by hiring new team members to work together on location. With\ninsights from network analytics, companies can make real change happen more\nquickly and more naturally.\n\n## Network analytics in action\n\nHow do network analytics work in the real world? A new dean at a top nursing\nschool, partnering with the Center for Creative Leadership, used network\nanalytics to better understand the team she was leading and plan a strategic\nreorganization to boost collaboration. Network maps indicated low levels of\nconnectivity among community members, suggesting that they functioned more\nlike an unconnected team of independent contractors than a cohesive group. The\ndean found little interaction, even by program, function, or role.\n\nThe network analysis brought legitimacy to restructuring efforts by readily\nillustrating the need for improved connectivity. It also helped the dean\nidentify informal, highly trusted leaders from across the school who were a\ngood fit for a steering committee that would plan the reorganization.\nCommittee members were able to design and accomplish a successful\nrestructuring within a tight timeframe and with broad faculty and staff\nsupport. The school accomplished a top-to-bottom restructuring in a short time\nand with broad support by strategically identifying thought leaders.\n\nIn another example, a pharmaceutical company partnered with the Center for\nCreative Leadership to spur innovation by increasing organizational cross-\ntalk. Network analytics revealed that 38 percent of employees didn't know each\nother, and 87 percent of daily communication was between employees housed on\nthe same floor. As a result, the company reorganized office space to promote\ncross-team collaboration. It also engaged in boundary-spanning coaching to\nencourage employees to make connections outside their teams.\n\nIn both examples, network analysis pointed toward concrete actions to make\nstrategic changes for the better. Whatever a company's goal, network analysis\ncan provide a lens that enables talent development leaders to leverage their\norganizations' social engines and identify promising starting points for\nimproving individual, team, and organizational outcomes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Rewiring Connections\n\nIf a network analysis suggests current connections are impeding day-to-day\nworkflow, an organization can rewire connections to encourage new patterns of\nwork and social activity. Here are three broad approaches talent development\nleaders should keep in mind.\n\n**Restructure the environment.** Proximity and the physical design of\nworkplaces can affect interaction patterns. Consider co-location of teams that\nneed to work closely together. Alter the placement of break rooms and other\ninformal meeting spaces to promote interaction and encourage greater\ncollaboration, innovation, and productivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf teams are geographically dispersed, look for ways to promote collaboration\nacross functions and organizational barriers. Set up small working groups that\npartner remotely to solve an internal business challenge. Consider short-term\njob swaps or work assignments that will take employees to a new location where\nthey can build new connections.\n\n**Redesign the organizational structure and processes.** The way employers\norganize teams and the way in which companies establish internal processes can\nhave a significant influence on workplace relationships. If either is too\nrigid, an organization can stifle creativity, create bottlenecks, and\nreinforce silos. Take a critical look at your company's business model,\nstrategy, structure, organizational chart, and the processes that govern how\nemployees accomplish work. Can you make changes to shift collaboration\npatterns and help bring important strategies to life?\n\n**Build a strategic change network.** Innovation is vital to any\norganization's success. If your network map shows your company lacks effective\nconnections to support innovation or share new ideas, it may be time to\nredesign workplaces to foster and encourage fresh ways of thinking.\n\nTo get started, engage a team of change agents who can unite individuals from\nacross the organization to spur collective action and bring strategy to life.\nIf you collected personally identifiable information to build relationship\nmaps, network analytics can help you readily identify great candidates. If you\ndidn't collect personal information, look to well-connected teams and ask for\nnominations or volunteers. Make sure to include members from across the\ncompany to encourage boundary spanning. Senior leaders also can use\nconnections from their personal networks to identify employees who are well\npositioned, willing, and able to help intentionally bridge communication gaps\nand barriers.\n\n* * *\n\n## Sample Network Map\n\nThe circles represent people; the lines represent their relationships. Circles\nwith thick lines represent well-connected people, while circles with thin\nlines are those who have fewer connections.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Expanding Role of Analytics\n\nThere is no doubt that the age of big data analytics has arrived. It is\nchanging what talent development professionals know, how quickly they know it,\nand what they do with what they learn.\n\nBusinesses worldwide have used analytics to transform their operations by\nuncovering insights buried in mountains of data and making them actionable.\nNow, this same data-based approach is making its way into the HR side of the\nequation.\n\nWhat can a talent development team do with analytics? It can understand and\nleverage networks in ways that can boost employee, team, and organizational\nperformance; identify the attributes of effective leaders and predict the best\nhires; and understand how to retain employees, improve equity and diversity,\ndrive collaboration, create successful teams, and improve learning.\n\nUltimately, analytics can help the talent development function get a clear and\nactionable picture of how work is getting done and how leader behaviors and\npractices, networks, culture, and employee experience and engagement influence\nthe company's most important business strategies.\n\nYour objective is to create an easy-to-follow, visual representation of\nworkplace relationships.\n\nWhen organizations take the time to understand the unique patterns of\ninteraction and workflow, they can accelerate change initiatives.\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Change Management](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Change%20Management)\n  * [Performance Consulting](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Performance%20Consulting)\n\n[SW](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephanieWormington)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Stephanie Wormington](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephanieWormington)\n\nStephanie Wormington is a research scientist in strategic research at the\nCenter for Creative Leadership; wormingtons@ccl.org.\n\n[SJ](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephenJeong)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Stephen Jeong](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephenJeong)\n\nStephen Jeong is a senior faculty member in leadership analytics at CCL;\njeongs@ccl.org.\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephenYoung)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Stephen Young](https://www.td.org/user/about/StephenYoung)\n\nStephen Young is manager of leadership analytics at CCL.

[Amit Agarwal](/about)\n\nPublished on 2016-02-22\n\nH\n\nPublished in: [Charts](/topic/charts/) \\- [Google Docs](/topic/google-docs/)\n\nDo you need a quick organization chart to show the hierarchy of employees in\nyour business? Well, just open a blank Google Spreadsheet, put the employee\nnames in a column and your org charge should be ready in minutes. Here\u2019s a\nsample org chart created with nothing but Google Sheets.\n\n![Org Charts with Google Sheets](../../../../images/2008/org-chart-google-\nsheet.png)\n\n## Create Organizational Charts with Google Spreadsheets\n\nHere\u2019s how you can put together an org chart in Google Sheets. It will be a\nlive chart meaning as you update the employee names or hierarchy in the\nspreadsheet, the org chart would update itself. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nStep 1. Open a Google Sheet and put the employee names in column A and the\nnames of the immediate managers in Column B.\n\nStep 2. Select the cells that you\u2019ve just entered and choose Chart from the\nInsert menu in the spreadsheet.\n\nStep 3. The Chart Editor will open inside Google Sheets. Switch to the Chart\nTypes tab and uncheck the option that says \u201cAggregate Column A.\u201d Then scroll\ndown the list of [available chart types](/software/find-right-chart-type-for-\nyour-data/6523/), choose \u201cOrganizational Chart\u201d and click _Insert_ to add the\nchart into your spreadsheet.\n\n[![Organization Charts](../../../../images/2008/organizational-\nchart.png)](http://img.labnol.org/di/organizational-chart.png)\n\nUnlike flowcharting tools like Visio, you don\u2019t have enough formatting options\nfor org charts in Google Sheets except for changing the background and fill\ncolors of various nodes in the chart. And if you hit the little drop-down\narrow in the chart box, you\u2019ll see an option to download the charge as a PNG\nimage for embedding on other websites.\n\nPublished in: [Charts](/topic/charts/)

To better\nunderstand the surge in new capabilities, Deloitte Consulting LLP's Bersin\u2122\nlaunched a market study. Some interesting capability trends emerged in our\nresearch:\n\n **Nontraditional data sources.** We have spoken to different providers that\nuse e-mail metadata to develop baselines for workplace culture, based on the\nfrequency and flow of communication across teams and networks. Others use\nnatural language processing to draw themes from worker comments on social and\nprofessional networking sites to identify strengths and opportunities. This\ndata can be used to identify workers who are more likely to be successful,\naddress engagement issues while they are still easily manageable or bolster\nthe collaboration of different groups. Additional insights can be derived from\naccessing data from operational business systems, like financial planning\nsystems, customer satisfaction databases, or sales management tools. Our High-\nImpact People Analytics research revealed that high-performing people\nanalytics teams collect data from an average of seven channels, as compared to\nonly three for their low-performing counterparts.\n\n**Advanced data integration.** Various data sources are most valuable when\nthey are integrated with each other, to determine relationships between\nactivities and results. There are quite a few solutions on the market that are\nnow making it easy to combine disparate sources of data. Most providers\ncombine the traditional sources of data (e.g., HR operational data from HCMS\nand ATS), but others are adding nontraditional data sources like assessments,\ncommunication data, social media activities and even customer satisfaction for\na more holistic view of the workforce. For example, by combining data from a\ncandidate relationship management platform and a performance management\nsolution, employees could get feedback on their strengths and development\nareas even before their first day on the job. Another example could be\nfeedback generated from an employee engagement solution combined with\nretention data, providing users with insight into potential reasons why an\nemployee chose to leave even without having to conduct an exit interview.\nThese insights can create actionable triggers for leaders to improve workplace\nculture.\n\n **Smart organization charts.** It has been fascinating to see the growth in\nhow tools can analyze and visualize an organization chart and display much\nmore than who reports to whom. Visualized charts and dashboards make it easier\nto understand priorities such as inclusion and retirement risk. It is one\nthing to see a bar chart of retirement risk, and another to see an org chart\nwith over half the individuals listed as likely to retire in the next five\nyears. These insights can trigger actions like high-potential identification\nand succession management to fill projected gaps.\n\n**User-based metrics and permissions.** Another critical requirement for\npeople analytics is having an actionable approach for different users--from\nthe CEO to the individual contributor. We have seen a collection of intuitive\nmetrics and data visualizations that make it easy for people at the individual\nlevel to take action based on data. For example, proactive notifications that\nremind an individual to take breaks, focus on a specific task or help find a\ngood stopping point for their day.\n\n**Network analytics.** It is exciting to see that network analytics is\nstarting to get broader acceptance as a general tool instead of being\nprimarily used by I/O psychologists. Just over 40 percent of the providers in\nour study indicate that they offer network analytics to understand the\nconnections and connectors in people data, with another 20 percent planning to\nadd the capability in the near future. Beyond an analysis of the inner\nworkings of organizations, we are seeing providers combine their network\nanalysis capabilities with other people data use cases to help achieve\nbusiness outcomes. For example, to determine connectors in organizations for\nchange management purposes, to bolster exposure for women to male leaders, or\nto strengthen integration work during mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWhat does this continued growth of new features and capabilities mean for your\norganization?\n\n  * Solutions are now available to help you understand the workforce experience throughout an employee's life cycle. Determine how the different pieces fit together to build your unique ecosystem of tools and don't wait for the silver bullet of a single solution. Bersin research has indicated that mature organizations manage an ecosystem of tools to generate rich insights and complex actions for business impact, pulling together the right tools for each problem.\n  * If your organization does not have the solutions necessary or the appetite to build these capabilities, focus on the outcomes you are looking to achieve, whether they be retention, engagement or productivity. Evaluate building the capability in-house against using a third-party provider who can do people analytics as a service, supporting your team on a temporary or ongoing basis. \n  * Look for opportunities to drive additional impact beyond HR efficiencies, financial returns or cost reduction. Today, organizations need to be social enterprises, both generating profit and improving the lives of workers, customers and communities as well as solving societal issues. People analytics can provide needed insights into work, workers and the workforce to accomplish this goal.\n\nGiven that high-performing people analytics enable significantly better\nworkforce and business outcomes, the cost of doing nothing might be too high\nto pass up.\n\n _Kathi Enderes, Ph.D., is vice president, Talent and Workforce Research\nLeader, Bersin\u2122, Deloitte Consulting LLP and Matthew Shannon is senior\nresearch analyst, Solution Provider Market, Bersin\u2122, Deloitte Consulting LLP._\n\n _\u00a9 2019.

software platforms automate the hiring\nprocess, helping you to save time and improve candidate experience. And as the\ndemand for cutting-edge recruitment technology rises, there are several\nsoftware options to choose from. In this article, we look at the ten best\nrecruitment software and tools and features to look out for._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n  * **Four Features That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n  * **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n  * **Need More Capabilities? Adopt These Cutting-edge Recruitment Software Innovations**\n  * **Choosing Wisely in a Crowded Digital Marketplace**\n\n## **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n\nRecruitment technology is defined as a set of tools used to automate the\nhiring process, connecting with a variety of data sources to access the best\nquality candidates. It performs key functions such as screening applicants,\nstreamlining follow-ups, and providing data on the efficiency of your\nrecruitment model.\n\nOver the last few years, the demand for recruitment software and tools has\nshot up dramatically as the labor market becomes fiercer and more complicated.\nCompanies are eager to hire highly skilled workers and drive business\ninnovation, even as the average tenure per employee continues to dip. In fact,\nglobal market research company Fortune Business Insights finds that the\nrecruitment software market will cross $3,000 million by 2025.\n\nInterestingly, recruitment doesn\u2019t always need to be a technology-driven\nprocess. However, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality talent that makes an\nexcellent culture fit, especially during a rapid growth phase, you will\nrequire recruitment software to achieve the right level of efficiency.\n\nRecruitment software doesn\u2019t just help you complete the formalities around\nhiring a candidate. It automates the entire recruitment pipeline right from\ncandidate sourcing and engagement to the final step of onboarding. That\u2019s why\nit has become a staple for the **[modern HR\ntoolkit](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/hr-\ntoolkit-of-the-future/)**.\n\n## **Four Features of Recruitment Software That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n\nGiven the highly crowded nature of the recruitment software marketplace, how\ndo you go about choosing one best suited to your enterprise? Are you aware of\nall the must-have features in any recruitment platform, and future trends in\nthis space?\n\nHere are a few key features that your recruitment software and tools should be\nable to perform:\n\n### **1\\. Plugging into a variety of data sources**\n\n  \nThe recruitment tool of your choice should be able to **integrate with the\nhighest possible number of data sources** , including social media, email, job\nboards, third-party staffing platforms, and several other **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** areas. It should also come with the requisite sort-and-\nfilter capabilities to help find the right talent.\n\n### **2\\. Deploying recruitment marketing initiatives**\n\n  \nToday, attracting and retaining candidates closely resembles the process of\nattracting and retaining consumers. That\u2019s why it is a recruitment best\npractice to **approach the hiring process as a sales and marketing campaign**.\n\nRemember to check if a recruitment software supports email automation, job ads\npublishing, video communication, **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** (CRM), and in-app\nmessaging to engage with applicants across the entire hiring journey.\n\n### **3\\. Shortlisting candidate profiles**\n\n  \nWith so many recommendations and leads flowing in from multiple sources, it\ncould be challenging to arrive at **an actionable list of candidates** \u2013 and\nthis is particularly true for bulk-hiring campaigns.\n\nRecruitment software should be able to build a searchable database of\napplicants, perform level-one resume screening, enable multi-channel\ncommunication within the platform, and aid your end-to-end selection process.\n\n### **4\\. Revealing insights into recruitment efficiency**\n\n  \nThis is one of the most significant advantages of using an analytics-driven\nrecruitment software versus legacy manual processes. The tool should be able\nto gather data across the recruitment pipeline to **extract useful insights,**\nsuch as which sourcing strategy is performing the best, whether your\ntime/cost-to-hire is sustainable, and key pain points in the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\nOver time, this feature will ensure your recruitment function becomes smarter,\nmore effective, and ready to stand out in a competitive hiring arena.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at the core features of recruitment software, let's turn\nthe spotlight on some of the most prominent players in this space and a few\ndisruptors that are making game-changing strides in recruitment software\ntechnology.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n## **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n\nAs technology evolves in leaps and bounds, powerful software and cutting-edge\ninnovation aren\u2019t limited to large enterprises anymore. For example, Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) has made it possible to deploy recruitment tools on a pay-\nper-use model, scaling up or down as necessary. APIs also enable easier\nintegrations without any complex back-end development.\n\nAs a result, our list of the best recruitment software for 2020 is a mix of\nenterprise-grade tools as well as smartly designed products for small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). We have tried to cover the varying needs of\nbusinesses of multiple sizes, and every software has excellent online customer\nreviews. Remember, the best recruitment software for you will depend on your\nunique business requirements \u2013 that\u2019s why the numbering on this list doesn\u2019t\nreflect the ranking of a particular recruitment tool.\n\n![The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and\nbeyond](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

In just 90 seconds, a company can\nset up (or disable) an employee's payroll, health insurance, work computer,\nand access to third-party apps such as Gmail, Microsoft Office, and Slack.\nPricing starts at $7 per user per month.\n\n**RUN Powered by ADP**  \nRUN Powered by ADP is a web-based payroll solution designed for small\nbusinesses that can integrate with multiple third-party accounting software\nand HR management services from ADP.\n\nRUN provides cash flow management by enabling users to track and verify cash\nrequirements before processing the actual payouts. It also allows users to\nmonitor complete analysis of their monthly payroll activities with its built-\nin reporting and analytics capabilities. It also has a dedicated HR portal to\nkeep all critical information in one place with online storage for saving\nemployee documents. It also comes with the support of ADP's payroll tax\ncompliance team with notifications for tax deadlines, changes, and new\nrequirements.\n\n**BambooHR**  \nBambooHR offers small and growing companies a human resource information\nsystem (HRIS) with an applicant tracking system (ATS) and HRIS tools for\nmanaging all aspects of the employee life cycle. The HCM software also\nprovides HR process automation tools that can be accessed in multiple\nlanguages and currencies. It allows HR professionals and managers to track\norganizational data, such as employee turnover and retention.\n\nBambooHR also offers the ability to maintain inactive employees, customization\nservices, user support, and multiple administrator seats. Administrators can\ngive access to all employees or limit access to those who need it.

Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-\nsoftware)\n\nThe software that redefined charting applications\n\nOffice 365 integration\n\nIndustry standard\n\nOnline and Windows app\n\nExpensive\n\nLacks inherent groupware features\n\nWhen most people think about flow charts, they almost immediately think of\n[Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software), although\nthe product is capable of creating all manner of diagrams quickly and\nefficiently.\n\nIt was one of the first products with smart drawing tools, and today it\nretains the ability for the tool to intelligently restructure a drawing as the\nuser moves objects around.\n\nThe obvious big selling point of Visio is that its part of the Office 365\nsuite, and therefore designed to integrate with the other Office tools\nseamlessly.\n\nMicrosoft offers four different options with Visio; two online, and another\ntwo that are standalone Windows applications.\n\nVisio Standard and Professional are the installable apps, and they retail for\n$375 and $709 respectively. As you might guess, that high pricing is intended\nto encourage you to subscribe to the online versions, labelled Visio Plan 1\nand Visio Plan 2.\n\nPlan 1 is pitched at $5 per user/month and is purely an online version, where\nPlan 2 costs $15 per user/month. And with that you also get online and Visio\nProfessional app, and access to better mobile tools, and a Visio Viewer for\niOS.\n\nThese prices are if you subscribe annually, with month-by-month pricing being\na little higher.\n\nFor those already using Office 365, many of the existing packages include the\nonline version of Visio. And, you can try that for free on Microsoft\u2019s Office\nonline website.\n\n  * [You can sign up for Microsoft Visio here](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software)\n\n[\n\n![SmartDraw](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: SmartDraw)](https://www.smartdraw.com/buy/)\n\n### [10\\. SmartDraw](https://www.smartdraw.com/buy/)\n\nThe popular choice for big business\n\nWorks with Confluence, JIRA and more\n\n70 chart types\n\nOnly on Windows\n\nExpensive per seat\n\nLike Lucid, [SmartDraw](https://www.smartdraw.com/buy/) can name an impressive\nlist of blue-chip companies that are license holders since the company started\nin 1994. These include at least half of the Fortune 500 quoted businesses and\nmore than 250,000 public and private enterprises across the globe.\n\nThe SmartDraw product can be used online or as a standalone Windows\napplication. It supports the creation of no less than seventy chart types,\nincluding all the standard ones.\n\nThere more exotic templates include those for documenting a crime scene,\nlandscape gardening, seating plan and even accident reconstruction.\n\nFor those working as part of a team, it supports Confluence, JIRA, Trello and\nGoogle\u2019s GSuite. And, it\u2019s fully compatible with Visio, able to import and\nexport diagrams and stencils with Microsoft\u2019s application.\n\nThe Windows Desktop offers a single user license for $297 and multi-user 5+\nlicenses from $595.  The online version is just $9.95 per month for one user,\nand $5.95 per user/month for 5+, both billed annually.\n\nThe multi-user packages have extra functionality that allows licenses to be\nmanaged and can also control the sharing of SmartDraw data with other users.\n\nMost of the sophistication of SmartDraw is in the templates and not the\napplication. Therefore it might be more suitable for those who make many\nsimple charts, and not those involved in the creation of very complex\ndiagrams.\n\n  * [You can sign up for SmartDraw here](https://www.smartdraw.com/buy/)\n\n## What to look for when choosing flowchart software\n\nAlthough designers might use these tools, the majority of people creating\nflowcharts aren\u2019t classically trained graphic designers. Therefore, they need\na tool that assumes no artistic abilities but can generate professional\nlooking results rapidly.\n\nThere is a fine balance between an application giving the operator the power\nto do whatever they want and funnelling their efforts in the direction of\nultimate success.\n\nThe way that most software handles this delicate balance is to offer the user\ntemplates that avoid them using too many fonts, or trying to cram too many\nelements into a design.\n\nIf the operator has graphical skills, these restrictions might seem a\nhindrance, but to the less confident, they can be exactly the structural\nsupport these folks need.\n\nThese are the key aspects that you might want to consider before purchasing a\nflowchart solution:\n\n  *  **Templates:** How many does the application have, and are any of them tailored to your specific needs (coding, game logic, command structures, etc)?\n  *  **Objects:** Almost all software will have a selection of predefined objects, and the number and quality of these should be assessed. If the graphical elements that you specifically need aren\u2019t in the library, the ability to define your own will be very important.\n  *  **Groupware:** As important as the creation of a diagram might be, getting it distributed and centrally updated is also critical. Some applications can enable multiple people to work on the same design, which might be useful when documenting an especially complicated process.\n  *  **Trial:** Some of these tools can be expensive or require ongoing licensing, so it is useful to test a trial version before investing company cash.\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

](https://www.techrepublic.com/rssfeeds/topic/project-\nmanagement/) on October 23, 2015, 8:54 AM PST\n\nDiagramming tools frequently offer a vast range of features and capabilities.\nOccasionally an app's scalability makes it unwieldy. Lucidchart suffers no\nsuch shortfall.\n\n[![](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/23/62b7c184-b0fb-4ffa-b4a0-89f97e88bcef/resize/770x/c8c2bf9ea7e10efa89093e0588049a45/lucidchart.jpg)](https://www.lucidchart.com/)\n\nImage: Lucidchart\n\nI recently needed to create a complex organizational chart. I've tried the\nusual culprits -- [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word) and\n[Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software)\n\\-- and even some creative options -- including\n[Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php) and\n[OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle). Seeking a cross-platform\ntool I could use to draft, edit, share, and update a professionally prepared\norganizational chart, I discovered [Lucidchart](http://www.lucidchart.com/).\n\nMy hopes rise every time I encounter a credit-card free trial, as is the case\nwith Lucidchart's web-based diagramming application. In my experience,\nwhenever a vendor feels sufficiently confident to provide a trial of its\nsoftware without requiring credit card information, the program typically\nproves sound.\n\nLucidchart did not disappoint. I was up and running with the online charting\napplication within minutes. Drafting a professional-appearing organization\nchart proved easiest with its straightforward tool that, while providing a\nrange of templates, formatting capabilities, and shapes, proved intuitive and\neasy to learn. You won't need a hefty missing manual to quickly become adept\nat aligning hierarchies, editing entries, or re-ordering items within\nLucidchart. Best of all, you can create an organizational chart using your\nMac, make fine-tune adjustments using a Linux box and even perform tweaks and\nshare the file using a Windows machine.\n\nWith support for Google Drive integration and real-time edits by other\nauthorized users, collaboration within larger teams is simplified. Because\nLucidchart also works with OmniGraffle, Microsoft Visio, and Google Docs, it's\na flexible platform that can be deployed within most environments.\n\n## Pricing options\n\nA **Basic account** is $4.95 per month paid annually ($5.95 month-to-month)\nfor a single user. The Basic account includes unlimited shapes and documents\nand 100 MB of online storage.\n\nA **Pro account** is $8.95 per month paid annually ($9.95 if paid month-to-\nmonth) for a single user. The Pro account includes professional shapes and\nfeatures, provides access to all shape libraries, and supports Microsoft Visio\nimport and export.\n\nA **Team option** is available for $20 a month when paid annually (or $30 per\nmonth if paid month-to-month). The Team account includes all Pro features and\nadds team administration and management capabilities and support for third-\nparty integrations, such as with Google Apps.\n\nThe **Enterprise account** adds enhanced authentication for compatibility with\nGoogle, OneLogin, Okta, and other platforms as well as enterprise-wide\ncontrols enabling consolidating users into a master account to simplify\nmanaging files. Pricing appears based on an enterprise's size, as large\norganizations are asked to contact Lucidchart at 650-733-6172 or to fill out a\n[web form](https://www.lucidchart.com/users/level).\n\n## How to create a chart or a diagram in Lucidchart\n\nActually creating a chart or a diagram is easy. Once you establish an account\nand log in, click the Documents button that appears at the top right of the\nwebpage. Choose either Create A Diagram, Search Tutorials, or Import Visio\nFile.\n\nChoosing Create A Diagram results in viewing standard flowchart templates,\nsuch as used for sales mapping, value stream tracking, and support processes.\nYou can choose to browse Standard diagram templates, Personal templates you've\nsaved, or templates loaded by Lucidchart's user community. Categories\npossessing preformatted templates include Business Analysis, Engineering,\nFloorplan, Network Infrastructure, and Org Chart.\n\nSelecting the Org Chart category reveals three Standard templates: Role,\nphone, email, Role, photo, and Vertical Org Chart. An animated quick tutorial\npop-up window appears demonstrating how to drag and drop shapes to create the\ndiagram. When clicking through the animated tutorial, the guide instructs\nusers how to connect shapes by clicking the edge of one shape and pulling out.\nThe tutorial also reviews adding colors and styles and provides instruction\nfor accessing additional shapes. Last, the tutorial demonstrates how to share\nthe diagram with others by using the provided Share button.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nLucidchart appears much like a full-fledged application within your browser,\nin my case Safari when I started. To switch to a Landscape layout, I clicked\nFile, selected Page Setup, and then chose Landscape. The application and\ninterface are intuitive and required little time to begin using proficiently.\nFor example, if you don't need a shape included within a pre-populated\ntemplate, just highlight the corresponding shape and press the Delete key and\nit's gone.\n\nChoose Lucidcharts for your organizational charting and diagramming needs and\nyou'll be in good company. Major firms that reportedly rely upon Lucidchart\ninclude Disney, Dropbox, Fidelity Investments, and Mozilla.\n\nAll told, Lucidchart reduced the time required developing hierarchies and\nrelocating entries to minutes, whereas the same attempts using other software\nled to frustrating delays. I'm a believer.\n\n## Also see\n\n  * [Before you pick an app, create a process map](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/before-you-pick-an-app-create-a-process-map/)\n  * [Desktop publishing from the browser: Lucidpress](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/desktop-publishing-from-the-browser-lucidpress/)\n  * [Five free web-based tools that make diagramming a snap](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-apps/five-free-web-based-tools-that-make-diagramming-a-snap/)\n  * [OmniGraffle 6 sets diagramming software standard](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/omnigraffle-6-sets-diagramming-software-standard/)\n\n##  Editor's Picks\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/02/18/d1467839-4251-47cb-9fa9-aed070561526/thumbnail/270x203/508393853879229378cfd403e0da67de/rainforest-connection.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-internet-of-wild-things-technology-and-the-battle-against-biodiversity-loss-and-climate-change/ \"The Internet of Wild Things: Technology and the battle against biodiversity loss and climate change\")\n\n### [The Internet of Wild Things: Technology and the battle against\nbiodiversity loss and climate\nchange](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-internet-of-wild-things-\ntechnology-and-the-battle-against-biodiversity-loss-and-climate-change/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/5c5916ea-f2ab-4727-869b-ef60be2bd28d/thumbnail/270x203/9e162ada81a7564ba62bc0c6bc070211/transgenderprideflag-istock-1155258427-nito100.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/transgender-employees-in-tech-why-this-progressive-industry-has-more-work-to-do-to-achieve-true-gender-inclusivity/ \"Transgender employees in tech: Why this \"progressive\" industry has more work to do\")\n\n### [Transgender employees in tech: Why this \"progressive\" industry has more\nwork to do](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/transgender-employees-in-\ntech-why-this-progressive-industry-has-more-work-to-do-to-achieve-true-gender-\ninclusivity/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/27/46755b49-0d4a-412e-8056-06238aa65723/thumbnail/270x203/3c90103c9194e7e5529c1d28e3e88f2b/guido-portrait-dan-stroud.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-one-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-planet/ \"Python is eating the world: How one developer's side project became the hottest programming language on the planet\")\n\n### [Python is eating the world: How one developer's side project became the\nhottest programming language on the\nplanet](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-\none-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-\nplanet/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/23/f34dea97-2e15-4fde-b846-44c696ae4d46/thumbnail/270x203/98bc6b07ed1800e851ca0bb22b963f61/m6-silver-photo-studio-frontfacinghero-singleuse-wetpad-phone.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-irobot-used-data-science-cloud-and-devops-to-design-its-next-gen-smart-home-robots/ \"How iRobot used data science, cloud, and DevOps to design its next-gen smart home robots\")\n\n### [How iRobot used data science, cloud, and DevOps to design its next-gen\nsmart home robots](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-irobot-used-data-\nscience-cloud-and-devops-to-design-its-next-gen-smart-home-robots/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/14/3c71922e-6b79-467e-8b5b-ff90dd0b2297/thumbnail/270x203/4236b19416f00f19d4afa5aab47d892f/edited.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/beyond-the-pc-lenovos-ambitious-plan-for-the-future-of-computing/ \"Beyond the PC: Lenovo's ambitious plan for the future of computing\")\n\n### [Beyond the PC: Lenovo's ambitious plan for the future of\ncomputing](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/beyond-the-pc-lenovos-\nambitious-plan-for-the-future-of-computing/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/d8f1f83b-cceb-4fd3-9342-91fb56e8f998/thumbnail/270x203/28820cac0d67c4fef0693120601b6b23/buffalotracehero.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/straight-up-how-the-kentucky-bourbon-industry-is-going-high-tech/ \"Straight up: How the Kentucky bourbon industry is going high tech\")\n\n### [Straight up: How the Kentucky bourbon industry is going high\ntech](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/straight-up-how-the-kentucky-\nbourbon-industry-is-going-high-tech/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nComment and share: Create an org chart or a diagram in minutes with Lucidchart\n\n[\n![]()![](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/11/15/2fde6fb1-d491-11e2-bc00-02911874f8c8/thumbnail/125x125/b52bc618e95cfbddeefe2f1429a52073/483479.jpg)](https://www.techrepublic.com/meet-\nthe-team/us/erik-eckel/)\n\n### By Erik Eckel\n\nErik Eckel owns and operates two technology companies.

HNA maps the interactions between teams and\nindividuals\u2014communication that often occurs outside the lines of the\norganizational chart\u2014to identify who employees work with most frequently, who\nthey turn to for advice, who they consider mentors and more. Using mapping\nsoftware and building on a legacy approach known as organizational network\nanalysis (ONA), the process analyzes network data like e-mail communication,\ncalendar appointments, instant messages, and interaction on internal networks\nlike Slack or Yammer to determine communication patterns, help identify hidden\ninfluencers and position employees where they can have the most impact.\n\nSome call HNA the art of making invisible patterns of strategically important\ncommunication visible. Vendors such as Polinode, Trustsphere, Socilyzer and\nHumanyze offer software that can help companies map these internal connections\n\nHNA also can help gauge changes in internal communication or collaboration\npatterns after major changes like company mergers or a restructuring. \"If\nyou're going through any change management exercise, a carefully constructed\nnetwork analysis can help you determine who now goes to who for answers,\ndirection and support,\" said Jeff Mike, vice president and head of HR research\nfor Bersin, Deloitte Consulting. \"That can help you identify and support\ninfluencers in the new version of the company.\"\n\nSome of these influencers might be previously unrecognized \"boundary spanners\"\nbetween functions like HR and information technology, Mike said. \"They could\nbe leaders, but they might also be technical experts or hold other titles.\"\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Developing and Sustaining High-Performance\nWork Teams_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/developingandsustaininghigh-performanceworkteams.aspx)\n_]_\n\nPower of Relational Analytics\n\nA recent study by Deloitte supports the argument that, despite the hype\nsurrounding people analytics, most such initiatives have only seen modest\nresults. The study found that only 9 percent of companies believe they have a\ngood understanding of which talent dimensions drive performance in their\ncompanies.\n\nSome believe the lackluster results stem from narrow approaches and using data\non individual employees when data about the interaction and relationships\nbetween people\u2014relational analytics\u2014is more important.\n\nCompanies including General Motors, Cisco and Ramco Systems, an enterprise\nsoftware provider based in India, have used relational analytics to spur\ninnovation, improve new-hire onboarding and boost sales performance. GM used\nthe approach to identify employees most likely to work together in ways that\nwould spur creative breakthroughs.\n\nRamco Systems improved the onboarding process of new sales employees. One of\nthe company's biggest challenges is replacing top salespeople, according to an\ninternal study that showed it took three to five months for new salespeople to\nestablish strong relationships with existing clients after replacing their\nseasoned predecessors. Ramco wanted to shorten that time frame and sought to\ndo so by using a network analysis tool to [create a visual map of connections\nof department sales executives](https://www.trustsphere.com/case-studies/).\n\nBy understanding the departing employees' networks at a client company and the\nformer salesperson's strongest relationships, new salespeople were able to\nprioritize where to spend their energy and create a smoother transition from\ndeparting employees to their replacements, reducing their ramp-up time to\nweeks instead of months.\n\nThe technology company Cisco implemented HNA after recognizing a fundamental\nshift in how work was getting done in the organization, said Gianpaolo\nBarozzi, senior HR director at Cisco in Milan, Italy.\n\n\"More and more work gets done today through hybrid human-machine combinations,\nad-hoc collaborations and globally dispersed groups,\" Barozzi said. \"In this\nenvironment, teams have become the fundamental unit and more organizations\nwork like a dynamic collective rather than as a static hierarchy.\"\n\nThat evolution led Cisco to launch an HNA initiative to better connect its\nexisting teams, to identify \"hidden\" teams\u2014those units not visible on an\norganizational chart but that exist as defined by people working together for\nspecific objectives\u2014and to create new teams. \"It gives us a network\nperspective in managing the organization,\" Barozzi said. \"It allows us to see\nhow connected teams are and who is playing critical roles in the network.\"\n\n_Dave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis._  \n\n[Organization and Employee\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and Employee\nDevelopment) [Technology](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Is+Human+Network+Analysis+the+Next+Frontier+in+People+Analytics%3f&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Human-Network-Analysis-People-Analytics.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Deloitte identifies organizational\nnetwork analysis (ONA) as a structured way to visualize how communications,\ninformation, and decisions flow through an organization. Each organization has\nfour elements:\n\n  * central node (people who seem to know everything and can influence the group quickly)\n  * knowledge broker (the mediator of the group who facilitates discussion)\n  * peripheral node (high-potential employees who opt to stay on the organization\u2019s periphery)\n  * ties (the formal and informal relationships between nodes).\n\nOften, leaders identified on an org chart are not the true hubs of information\nflow. Finding the relationships between nodes and ties makes it much easier to\nidentify critical connections and potential barriers to information flow and\ncollaboration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing ONA to inform organization design efforts can help:\n\n  * Increase operational effectiveness by building an organization that is structured to increase collaboration and exchange of information between the right people.\n  * Transform companies in a smarter way by identifying formal and informal leaders who can be counted on to facilitate change and help accelerate the realization of transformation benefits.\n  * Use talent more effectively by minimizing role confusion and redundancy.\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/ATDStaff-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[ATD Staff](https://www.td.org/user/about/ATDStaff-000001)\n\nThe Association for Talent Development (ATD) is a professional membership\norganization supporting those who develop the knowledge and skills of\nemployees in organizations around the world.

__Up\n\n[](https://www.bbva.com/en/guest-authors/communications/) [Communications\n](https://www.bbva.com/en/guest-authors/communications/)\n\nIn 2019, BBVA reached a landmark milestone: By incorporating agile methodology\ntechniques into their daily business activities it transformed the way the\nGroup's entire 33,000-strong central services division organizes itself and\nworks. This achievement represents a decisive inflection point in BBVA\u2019s\ntransformation process and serves as an opportunity to reflect on the route\nthat has led the bank so far.\n\n[ __ Listen to audio ](https://app-eu.readspeaker.com/cgi-\nbin/rsent?customerid=8166&lang=en&readclass=detContHeader683702,detContContent683702&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbva.com%2Fen%2Fagile-\nat-bbva-a-journey-of-continuous-transformation%2F \"Listen this page using\nReadSpeaker\") [ __ Leer en espa\u00f1ol ](https://www.bbva.com/es/agile-en-bbva-un-\nviaje-de-transformacion-continua/)\n\n### [Innovation](https://www.bbva.com/en/science-\ntechnology/technologies/innovation/)\n\n## [The 'Agile' movement conquers BBVA](https://www.bbva.com/en/agile-\nmovement-conquers-bbva/)\n\nThe objective is not an easy one to achieve: making sure that the products\nthat reach the market are the ones customers need and demand. The task is even\nmore complicated if production must be speeded up, in order to reach the\nmarket before the competition. Tech companies were pioneers in facing this\nchallenge; they did so by using agile methods, a way of working that has\nplayed a key role in the success of companies like Google and Spotify, and\nwhich BBVA has made a fundamental tool in accelerating its digital\ntransformation.\n\nThe landscape of the financial sector is changing at breakneck speed, with\ntechnological disruption and the emergence of new entrants \u2014 both start-ups\nand digital giants \u2014contributing to this change. BBVA understood that to\ncompete within this ever-changing context, **organizations would have to\ncontinuously adapt to the sector\u2019s evolving changes**. Achieving this required\nmore than a technological transformation; an organizational and cultural\ntransformation to completely change the bank's way of working was needed.\n\nWith this underpinning its reasoning, five years ago BBVA embarked on a\nmission to deploy an [agile](https://www.bbva.com/en/agile-methodology-la-\nrevolution-ways-working/) organizational model, which would furnish the bank\nwith the ability to constantly adapt. Driven by this mission, the bank\naccomplished the largest scale agile transformation undertaken by a business\nto date.\n\n## How did the first BBVA agile team come about?\n\nEssentially, Agile is a project management methodology that **empowers\nautonomous, multi-disciplinary teams** who can focus on delivering tangible\nresults in short turnaround times. The project's progress can thus be\nmonitored and, if necessary, the path re-routed \u2014 always with customer\nsatisfaction as the priority.\n\nThis approach to project management made inroads at the bank with increased\ninterest in exploring new ways of working. Testing the new approach began in\n2014 with teams that were tasked with developing a new mobile banking\napplication. The goal of the app was to address customer needs vis-a-vis the\nmanagement of their accounts, in addition to offering [value added\nservices](https://www.bbva.com/es/es/bbva-valora-ofrece-a-\ncasi-600-000-clientes-la-evolucion-estimada-de-su-inversion-en-vivienda/)\nbased on new technologies like [artificial\nintelligence](https://www.bbva.com/en/the-artificial-intelligence-behind-the-\nworlds-best-banking-app/). To reach this goal, small autonomous teams were\nformed, comprised of people from different departments with specialized\nprofiles in different domains. These teams began to work [in a radically\ndifferent way](https://www.bbva.com/en/bbvas-new-ways-of-working-to-\naccelerate-its-transformation/) to how the bank had traditionally operated:\nthese were scrum teams.\n\nThis was the beginning of the first BBVA agile team whose work proved to be a\ntotal success: [BBVA's app in Spain has been recognized by the consulting\nfirm, Forrester, as the best in the world for three consecutive\nyears](https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-is-the-overall-leader-in-mobile-banking-\nfor-the-third-year-in-succession/).\n\n## From scrum to digital factories\n\nAfter the success of this initiative, the bank decided to form more scrum\nteams in order to tackle new, high-impact business projects. Thus emerged, in\nSpain and Mexico, what BBVA calls its **digital factories** ,[ groups\ndedicated to delivering projects that are high priority for the bank's\ntransformation](https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-accelerates-its-digital-factory-\nthanks-agile/).\n\nThe bank incorporated people from other departments (like the legal and\ncompliance teams) into the growing number of scrum teams and extended this new\nway of working to other countries in the Group\u2019s footprint. This process\nentailed significant change management, not only with respect to the bank\u2019s\npeople and culture, but it also involved revamping internal processes that had\nbeen designed with a hierarchical approach to work.\n\nBBVA's digital factories served to strengthen the bank's commitment to the\nagile approach, while at the same time demonstrating that larger-scale\norganizational changes were needed if they were to continue pressing ahead\nwith this way of working. Resources from various departments were being\npoached to create these multi-disciplinary scrum teams and to work on new,\nagile projects. This created work overloads as teams were stretched to keep up\nwith normal levels of work.\n\nThis situation triggered the decision to transform **the structure of the\nentire central services** organization, so that it would be possible to\nrespond to the demand for projects focused on delivering new technology-based,\nvalue-added offerings while at the same time continuing to respond to the\nbusiness-as-usual (BAU) needs.\n\n![]()\n\n![empresa-empleados-recurso-bbva](https://www.bbva.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/empresa-empleados-recurso-bbva-1024x591.jpg)\n\n## The outcome: a more flexible organization\n\nAt the outset, the **organization was traditionally structured along\nfunctional silos** , which carried out different parts of a single process\nwithout the benefit of having a complete view of its execution. This way of\nworking proved inadequate for the bank's new challenges and prevented a\n\u201cliquid\u201d resource pool where people could be assigned to the highest priority\nprojects or processes at any given time.\n\nIn light of this situation, BBVA elected to **radically shake-up its\norganizational structure**. The Group approached this change with the\nexperience it had gained by implementing agile techniques and with the goal of\ncreating a more transparent, flexible, and productive organization.\n\nThis organizational change also called for the total visibility and\ntransparency of the projects that were underway. To gain this visibility, BBVA\ncreated the **Single Development Agenda (SDA)** , which serves to prioritize\nall the bank's global projects [taking into account their criticality and\nalignment with the Group strategy](https://www.bbva.com/en/weve-replaced-\nstatic-department-budgets-resource-management-that-is-dynamic-and-global/),\navoiding duplication and lack of strategic focus.\n\nBy establishing the SDA, the Group was able to obtain a holistic view of the\nbank\u2019s capacity to deliver projects and has thus become the essential\nfoundation for a staffing model that meets demands. Finally, the model has\nbeen designed to assign each resource to the projects where she or he will add\nthe most value based on knowledge and experience.\n\n## A new organization, new tools for professional development\n\nBBVA is the first large enterprise to have completed an **agile transformation\nof its central service functions** across all its subsidiaries worldwide. This\naccomplishment represents an all-encompassing milestone: not only was the\norganizational and governance structure changed, but so to was the way of\nworking and the professional development of more than 33,000 people who work\nin the bank\u2019s central services.\n\nThis change has redefined the traditional concept of departments and\nfunctional divisions, establishing a new structure composed of five main\nblocks for each department:\n\n  * **Customer management** (\u201cfront line\u201d): small teams that manage the relationship between different departments.\n  * **Project teams:** autonomous, multi-disciplinary teams empowered to reallocate resources on a quarterly basis depending on the bank's strategic priorities. Typically, they adhere to a \u201cscrum model.\u201d\n  * **Process teams:** tasked with executing recurring processes supporting business activity or project teams. Typically, they work according to a kanban model.\n  * **Disciplines** : smaller teams, focused on managing and sharing the bank's knowledge and best practices in areas of technical expertise.\n  * **Control** : teams that cut across all the Group's management, business, or operational departments.\n\nIn parallel, for each discipline, Communities of Practice (CoPs) have been\nestablished, conceived to be expert communities that share knowledge and\nexpertise and co-create solutions and tools that will be made available to the\nentire Group.\n\n> Teams, therefore people, are the cornerstone of the bank's new organization,\n> because they are the ones responsible for the success of the bank's\n> transformation\n\nTools designed to promote employee professional development in the new\norganization were also created. They include an evaluation model aligned to\nthe new project approach to work and the role of the \u201cpeople leader\u201d to give\nemployees career path advice and give employees visibility within the\norganization.\n\nAt the same time, to ensure the transformation\u2019s bedding-in, the bank staff\nhad to be trained on the new work methodologies and given support during the\ntransition to a model that broke with tradition. To this end, firstly, the\nbank created a team dedicated to both promoting the agile model across all the\nbank's departments and geographical footprint as well as to measuring the\ndegree to which the new methodologies were adopted. Second, the \u201c **agile\ncoach** \u201d role was defined [to support all\nteams](https://www.bbva.com/es/agile-coaches-los-guias-de-la-transformacion-\ndigital-de-bbva/) in order to guarantee that the techniques and tools of the\nnew model were adopted, thus ensuring maximum benefit from the new approach.\nAgile coaches teach the teams how to work independently and support the\nrequired change of mentality, helping teams focus on deliverables, quality,\nand customers.\n\n![](https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/agile-trabajo-proyectos-\nmetodologia-productividad-bbva-1024x423.jpg)\n\nTeams, therefore people, are the cornerstone of the bank's new organization,\nbecause they are the ones responsible for the success of the bank's\ntransformation. For the same reason, the **bank\u2019s leaders also assume a\nfundamental role** ; their conviction in the new culture is essential for the\nnew model to work. To facilitate this new process, training and evaluation\nprograms have been launched, designed to encourage [the adoption of a new\nleadership style that puts leaders at the disposal of\nteams](https://www.bbva.com/es/transformacion-agile-2-0-crear-un-nuevo-estilo-\nde-liderazgo/) and aimed at fostering camaraderie as individuals embark on\npaths of professional development that are aligned to the new reality.\n\nThe transformation process came hand-in-hand with significant challenges that\nhave been overcome over the course of the past five years. But the journey\ncontinues, and there is still a long way to go: the determination to keep\nmoving forward is based on the conviction that embracing change is the only\nway to bring the age of opportunity to our customers.\n\nKeep reading about\n\n  * [BBVA projects](https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-projects/)\n  * [Digital processing](https://www.bbva.com/en/economy/computerstudies-sciences-and-development/digital-processing/)\n  * [Organizational changes](https://www.bbva.com/en/economy/business-economics/organizational-changes/)\n\nOther interesting stories\n\n## Subscribe to our Newsletter and receive our news at the moment by mail\n\nReceive in your email the latest information on mortgages: products, tips and\nrecommendations to make the best decision.\n\nWrite your email\n\n__The email entered is not valid, re-enter it\n\n__Delete\n\n__Press Enter\n\nKeep me up I'm not interested, thanks.\n\nI have read and agree to the [Personal Data Protection\nPolicy](https://www.bbva.com/en/)\n\n__You must accept the privacy policy and the legal conditions\n\n__\n\n## Thanks for subscribing!\n\nWe have just sent you an email to confirm your subscription.\n\n__\n\n## Sorry\n\nSomething has gone wrong.

(or\nstylesheets), but they can make work easier and faster\u2014and more visually\nappealing. In this feature, we\u2019re going to go over Cell Styles, and Smart Art,\nDrawing, Graphics, Picture, and Chart Tools. (We\u2019re skipping 3D Model Tools\nfor now because they don\u2019t have Styles.)\n\n## Cell Styles\n\nIf you type a sentence in Excel, most of us just format the sentence using the\nfeatures in the Font, Alignment, or Number groups, which include additional\nfeatures such as colors, borders, orientation, and more. Or we might right-\nclick for the popup/context menu and choose the features from there.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/02-sample-text-stylesheet-\nin-excel-100769778-orig.jpg) JD Sartain / IDG Worldwide\n\nSample text Stylesheet in Excel\n\nHowever, you can also select the group called _Styles_ > _Cell Styles_ , and\nchoose preset styles with custom fonts, colors, and attributes, as well as\nborders, shading, and paragraph levels such as Heading 1, Heading 2, Title,\nand more. Play around to learn more about your choices.\n\n[[ Further reading: The best free software for your PC\n]](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2082305/software/best-free-software-for-\npc.html)\n\nThe best way to explain how Graphic Styles work in Excel is to just create\nsome.\n\n## Smart Art Tools & Styles\n\nSmart Art Graphics are Excel\u2019s premade business graphics. A partial list of\nthe graphics includes:\n\n  * Block Lists\n  * Process Arrows and Diagrams\n  * Organizational Charts\n  * Radial Cycles\n  * Segmented Pyramids\n  * Picture Grids\n  * Image Captions\n  * Interconnected Rings\n  * ...and 200 plus more.\n\n1\\. Open Excel. From the _Insert_ tab > _Illustrations_ group, click the\n_Smart Art Graphic_ icon (between _Shapes_ and _Store_ on the Ribbon menu).\n\n2\\. Browse through the list and select a Smart Art Graphic for this exercise.\nWe chose _Process_ > _Step Down Process_ , then clicked _OK_.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/03-select-a-smart-art-\ngraphic-100769776-orig.jpg) JD Sartain / IDG Worldwide\n\nSelect a Smart Art graphic\n\n3\\. Excel drops the graphic in the center of the page showing the selection\nhandles/circles, which means the graphic is active. When a graphic is active,\nExcel displays a new tab on the Ribbon menu called [something _]_ _Tools_ >\n_Design/Format_ where the \u201csomething\u201d is determined by the selected graphic,\nsuch as Smart Art Tools, Drawin _g_ Tools, Chart Tools, Graphics Tools, and\nPicture Tools. If you de-select (or click outside) the graphic, these menu\nitems disappear.\n\n4\\. The _Smart Art Tools_ > _Design_ menu includes the following groups:\nCreate Graphic, Layouts, Change Colors, Smart Art Styles, and Reset. From\nhere, you can select a different Layout, a different Smart Art Style, or\nChange Colors.\n\n5\\. Under the _Smart Art Tools_ > _Format_ menu, you can edit the Shapes in 2D\n(for easy editing); alter the Shape Styles; change the shape, color, outline,\nor Effects; change the WordArt Style; alter the arrangement or alignment of\nthe graphics; and alter the size.\n\n **NOTE:** Notice that the text inside a text box can use the popup/context\nmenu, the Ribbon menu, or the preset Styles menus from the _Drawing Tools_ >\n_Format_ menus tab. The text inside an illustration or picture (such as a\nGraphic, Chart, Drawing, Smart Art, Word Art) uses the corresponding _Tools_ >\n_Design / Tools_ > _Format_ menus.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/04-smart-art-tools-\ndesignformat-plus-drawing-tools-format-100769777-orig.jpg) JD Sartain / IDG\nWorldwide\n\nSmart Art Tools\u2014Design-Format plus Drawing Tools Format\n\n6\\. Select the Step Down Process graphic.\n\n7\\. Under the new Smart Art Tools tab, choose _Design_ > _Smart Art Styles_.\n\n8\\. Select a Style from the menu box or click the small expansion arrow\n(bottom right of menu box), and choose a Style from the expanded icon list.\n\n9\\. Next, click the _Change Colors_ button (from the Smart Art group) and\nselect a group of colors from the color themes in the menu window.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/05-select-a-style-and-\ncolors-for-the-smart-art-graphic-100769779-orig.jpg) JD Sartain / IDG\nWorldwide\n\nSelect a Style and Colors for the Smart Art graphic\n\n10\\. With the graphic still selected, choose _Smart Art Tools_ > _Format_ ,\nand another menu of Styles and formatting features appears. Select Shape\nEffects to add a Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Soft Edges, Bevel Style or 3D\nRotation.\n\n **NOTE:** Notice that Shape Fill and Shape Outline change the background\ncolor of the graphic box or adds a border around the graphic box, _not_ the\ngraphics _inside_ the box, unless you select the graphics inside the box\nseparately or use **Ctrl+ Left Click** ( **Ctrl+ Select** ) to select multiple\ngraphics inside the box. For example, you might select both arrows and make\nthem the same color.\n\n[](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/06-select-shape-effects-\nfor-shadow-reflection-glow-soft-edges-bevel-\nstyle3d-rotation-100769780-orig.jpg) JD Sartain / IDG Worldwide\n\n##### Select Shape Effects for Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Soft Edges, Bevel\nStyles + 3D- Rotation\n\n## Drawing Tools & Styles\n\n1\\. From the _Insert_ tab > _Text_ group (far right side of Ribbon menu),\nselect the WordArt button (the right-tilting letter \u2018A\u2019).\n\n2\\. Choose a text design, and a text box opens that says: _Your Text Here_.\nEnter some text (we entered the words Excel Styles).\n\n3\\. Notice that the new tab says _Drawing Tools_ > _Format_. Select _WordArt\nStyles_ > _Text Effects_ > _Transform_. As you move your cursor down the menu\nlist, the selected text changes so you can see and decide which text effect\nyou prefer; follow _Path_ or _Warp_.\n\n4\\. For the second graphic on this Excel screen, choose a Shape from _Insert_\n> _Shapes_.

Technology governs our work as well and demands that we stay\nready to adapt with agility and intelligence. With so much around us in a\nstate of constant flux, Human Capital Management (HCM) warrants a deeper\nunderstanding.\n\n## **1\\. What is Human Capital Management?**\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management, with the goal of achieving organizational competency for\nworkforce acquisition, management and optimization.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into HCM processes, features and strategies, let\u2019s take\na moment to focus on the key elements of the definition.\n\n**First** , HCM is not mere theories and rules \u2013 but rather a \u201cset of\npractices\u201d. The practical aspect of HCM is important because it points to the\nfact that in order to be practical, these systems need to stay relevant.\n\n**Second** , HCM is \u201cfocused on the organizational need\u201d. What might be\nperfect for organization A might be a completely wrong fit for organization B.\nThe point to be noted here is that while we are often bombarded with best\npractices for doing everything, the best practice to start with is often to\nstep away from the herd and find the best fit.\n\n**Third** , under the HCM canopy, we need to find the right competencies to\nfocus on with regard to \u201cworkforce acquisition, workforce management, and\nworkforce optimization\u201d. While the use of \u201cworkforce\u201d may seem a little dated\nin today\u2019s WoW (World of Work) of \u201ctalent\u201d speak, the definition does capture\nthe essence of HCM. Having said that, the practices under HCM need to evolve\nto keep pace with our growing relationship with technology.\n\nToday there are multiple HCM suite solutions available in the market. For\nexample, multi-feature, comprehensive suite offerings by Workday, SAP, Oracle,\nPeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer such a wide\nvariety of solutions that it leads to a decision dilemma in assessing what\nwould really work for a particular organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n## **2\\. The 3 core aspects of Human Capital Management (HCM)**\n\nHuman Capital Management covers a wide spectrum of talent acquisition and\nmanagement processes throughout the employee life cycle. To understand better,\nlet\u2019s divide the whole spectrum into three broad functionalities \u2013 **(A)\nTalent Acquisition (TA), (B) Talent Management and (C) Talent Optimization** \u2013\nand deep dive into the nuances within each of these categories.\n\n### **Talent Acquisition**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s always best to start at the beginning - where the employee life cycle\ncommences. To be precise though, it actually starts just before the TA\nprocesses with Talent Gap Analysis. Predictive workforce planning tools like\nSAP HR Analytics and Oracle HCM Cloud take into consideration the current\ntalent spread, the immediate talent requirements and business strategies to\nmap future requirements based on a holistic analysis.\n\nA comprehensive TA-centric Human Capital Management system needs to cater to\nthe needs of the primary TA process:\n\n  1. **[Recruitment/ eRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-recruitment/) \\- **This includes sourcing, screening, qualifying, and skill-matching\n  2. [**ATS (Application Tracking System)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)\n  3. **[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) \\- **background checks, joining formalities, orientation, and a 30-60-90 day growth plan to get the new recruit started.\n\n  \nSolutions like SuccessFactors, SilkRoad Life Suite, Taleo (Oracle talent\ncloud), ClearCompany HRM and TribeHR offer tools that focus on gaining access\nto and acquiring the right talent. Finding the right match in today\u2019s\nimpatient and volatile environment is as difficult as it is necessary. An\nefficient ATS, for example, not only makes the job of the smart recruiter\neasier, but also improves the candidate experience. Recruitment being the\nfirst engagement between an organization and a prospective employee, it\nmatters how well the system is managed.\n\nWhile smart recruitment algorithms and recruiting chatbots have made the\ninitial stages of sourcing and screening a lot easier, a comprehensive end-to-\nend TA HCM solution needs to deliver more than that. It needs to be able to\nhelp the TA manager with the processes of qualifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, scheduling\ninterviews and skillset-matching while helping to collect and store data for\nbackground checks, carry out joining processes and also helping chart out a\ngrowth plan for the first three months for the new joinee. A 30-60-90day plan\nnot only lends more credibility to the need for a particular talent bust also\nprovides the newbie with a business-goals-centric plan to get started during\nthe first three crucial months.\n\nHuman Capital Management suites can also make the first day at work a lot\nsmoother and a lot less daunting with conversational bots to guide the way and\nhelp in a preliminary orientation to software, processes and organizational\ncharts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n### **Talent Management**\n\n  \nThe nature of talent that present-day organizations have to manage has changed\nmore in the last decade than it had changed over the 30 years before that.\nWork is no longer a place but a function with teams dispersed across\ncontinents, freelancers pitching in and increasingly flexible work-hours.\nHuman Capital Management systems need to be aware of and conscious about these\nnew tweaks to the work ecosystem. Keeping that in mind, here are the must-have\nfeatures for a talent management HCM system:\n\n**1.** **Time and attendance**\n\n  * Leaves and Absence management\n  * Self-service application and tracking systems\n  * Biometrics and security\n\n  \nWith an increase in remote workers, freelancers and globally dispersed teams,\nmapping time and attendance while also maintaining security needs is crucial.\nTools like TimeAttend and CeiPal Workforce make it easier to track and manage\non-the-job timings, leave applications and security requirements. Moreover,\nHCM tools enable self-service by allowing employees to manage their data\nthemselves thus creating greater transparency and improved engagement.\n\n**2.** **Payroll**\n\n  * Compensation mapping\n  * Remuneration tracking and roll-out\n  * Compensation planning for gig workers\n\n  \nWhile the focus has been growing on the non-monetary aspects at work,\ncompensation and benefits would always remain a key motivator. No matter how\nhard we try to eliminate the transactional nature of jobs, at the end of the\nday, while the paycheck is not the only thing that matters, it surely matters\na lot. Using Human Capital Management tools to manage payroll has been in\npractice for quite a few years now since it is one of the easier things to\nautomate. AI-enabled payroll HCM like Zenefits and RUN help in mapping\nindustry trends to benchmark compensation plans for the different sets of\nworkers from full-time on-location to remote gig-workers.\n\n**3.** **Performance management**\n\n  * Goal-alignment\n  * Task-tracking\n  * Internal communication and team planning\n\nHCM systems encourage and enable better communication. These mechanisms allow\nanytime-anywhere access, help in planning goals, aligning individuals and\nteams on the relevant business objectives and also allow 360 degree task-\ntracking. With tools like Performly, AssessTEAM, PerformancePro and BirdDogHR,\norganizations can boost productivity in ways that are more congenial to\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)\n\n**4.** **Culture connect**\n\n  * Rewards and recognition\n  * Grievance addressal and redressal systems\n  * Weaving ethics into the system\n\n  \nWhat employees do at work everyday makes up the culture of the organization.\nWith tools like Globoforce and TinyPulse, organizations can build a branded\nculture of ethical behavior, recognition, gratitude and engagement. Moreover,\nwith Human Capital Management software, the culture can be translated to every\nemployee in all the functions that they serve and all the processes that they\nare a part of.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **Talent Optimization**\n\n  \nThe journey does not end with finding the right talent \u2013 it begins from there.\nIn that journey there can be no room for stagnation. Organizations need to\nconstantly try to create avenues for talent optimization \u2013 for individual and\ncollective growth, without turning on business goals and objectives. You need\nto future-proof your employees. Here are four ways in which the right HCM can\nenable that:\n\n  1. Career-pathing\n  2. Competency mapping\n  3. Succession planning\n  4. Learning and development\n\nWith a tailored HCM solution, organizations can not only train their employees\non immediate skill needs but also for the skill requirements of the future.\nCoursera, for example enables skills benchmarking with the use of AI\n(Artificial Intelligence). With efficient cloud-backed, data-driven HCM\nsystems, organizational leaders can make the right career-pathing decisions in\nadvance thus providing both the organization and the individual a map to\nfollow. Succession planning has been proven to a great way to optimize HiPos\nand the right HCM tools can help in decisions regarding the same by studying\ngallons of data. Tools like SuccessFactors HCM by SAP encourage diverse teams\nto collaborate better and optimize on the positives of having a team of very\ndifferent individuals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management?

The Right HCM Solution: Finding the \u201cSuite\u201d Spot**\n\nLike we stated in the beginning, when it comes to choosing an HCM suite, best-\nfit matters more than best practices.\n\nHere are some key considerations and questions when choosing the right HCM\nsolution\n\n### **1.** **Why do we need an HCM system?**\n\n  \nYou need to know what are the areas that need greater intervention, what are\nthe reasons that some processes have been difficult or stalled and what you\nwish you achieve with the investment in a new tool-system.\n\n### **2.** **What are the must-have and nice-to-have features we want?**\n\n  \nThe MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) priority\nlist is a great start for any decision. You need to be able to answer what the\nHCM solution must do, should do, could do and also what it would do in the\nfuture.\n\n### **3.** **Present budget v/s growth needs?**\n\n  \nTo answer this, you might first have to identify where in the spectrum you\nfall. Are you an SMB (small and medium business) with less than 1000\nemployees, an MM (mid-market) player with an employee strength between\n1000-5000, an enterprise with over 5000 employees, a well-established MNC with\nover 10000 employees or are you a cusp organization transitioning between\nthese segregations? Based on where you fall in the spectrum and where you are\nheaded, you need to choose a solution that caters to your immediate needs but\nthat is also dynamic enough to incorporate your future needs. Your budget\nwould differ accordingly.\n\n### **4.** **What is the level of customization you require?**\n\n  \nThere are multiple HCM suite players in the market today that offer need-based\nplans. Most basic plans do not allow for customization but you need to be\nclear about what customizations you would need.\n\n### **5.** **Are you ready to adapt?**\n\n  \nBefore you build your case for investing in a new or upgraded HCM solution,\nask yourself whether your organization is ready for the change. There is often\nthe need for training with the introduction of any new tool and employees need\nto be allowed some teething time as well. The organization must be willing and\ncapable of letting employees and HR adapt to the change.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the\nDifference?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/hris-vs-hcm-whats-the-difference/)\n\n## **The 5 Big HCM Trends for 2020**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse into the future and the five key trends that would shape up\nthe HCM space in the years to come:\n\n### **1\\. An end to worries about job-stealing-AI**\n\n  \nContrary to the \u201cAI Apocalypse\u201d narrative, recent studies point out that 93%\nof people are willing to take orders from a robot and 70% of employees are\nalready using some form of AI in their personal lives. By 2020, with this\nmentality seeping into work culture, employees would become a lot less fearful\nand a lot more adaptive to AI.\n\nThis would lead to greater, more effective human-AI collaboration in the\nsuper-job era, and better rationalization of high-value jobs and roles for\nhumans. It also means that HCM systems need to be set up to manage all kinds\nof \u2018employees\u2019 - human and non-human.\n\n### **2\\. AI will no longer be optional**\n\nAccording to a recent study by Oracle, 79% of HR leaders believe that failure\nto adopt AI will have a negative impact on their overall organization;\nhowever, only 6% of HR professionals are actively deploying AI solutions.\nRealizing this discrepancy will push more companies than ever \u2013 including\nthose that have traditionally been hesitant \u2013 to embrace artificially\nintelligent solutions.\n\nWhile more involvement and encouragement from the HR to create an AI-enabled\nwork culture would be ideal, the fact is that many HR teams are still\nstruggling with basic digital transformation and automation challenges. A\nstep-change approach is needed to ensure the drastic transformation - and your\nsystems need to be able to support this transformation with agility and scale.\n\n### **3\\. HR to lead the predictive analytics movement**\n\n  \nWhile many think of HR as a \u201csoft\u201d skill, the future of this industry is built\non the use of predictive analytics to make intelligent employee decisions. A\nrecent survey by HBR shows that 31% of HR professionals are already using AI-\nbacked data analysis to identify at-risk talent, source best-fit candidates\nvia resume analysis, and predict high-performing recruits. In 2020, I expect\nthis number to jump much higher.\n\nSmarter decisions backed by data and powered by predictive tools are on the\ncards, but what new skills do HR leaders need on their teams to ensure they\ncan make the most of these smart decision-making tools? What new workflows\nneed to be defined, designed and automated to ensure these smarter methods of\ntalent acquisition and employee retention are executed flawlessly\n\n### **4\\. Digital assistants will become \u201cco-workers\u201d**\n\n  \nDigital assistants, accessible through voice or SMS, work 24/7 and can provide\nnearly-instant, tailored responses on simple tasks like vacation balance and\nexpense approval to complicated subjects like taxes and benefits. Over time,\nthe digital assistants can even take on more sophisticated personas such as\nmentors, coaches or counselors.\n\nThe need to understand generational diversity at work better and in ways that\nare more actionable will be strategic to organizational success. Smart HCM\nSystems will create a seamless employee experience for everything from\nefficient and effective employee onboarding; day-to-day time-consuming tasks\nlike expense reporting; and career-defining initiatives such as coaching with\nreal-time, always-on systems that employees can access at their convenience\n\n### **5\\. Smarter, mobile recruitment**\n\n  \nWith the human attention span averaging just 8 seconds and the unemployment\nrate at its lowest in 50 years, applying for jobs needs to be easy and able to\nbe done on-the-go. Moving into 2020 and beyond, HR professionals will be\nforced to adapt their recruiting techniques to this new norm or risk losing\nquality talent to competitors.\n\nOrganizations need to create their employer brand based on candidate\nexpectations, technology trends, and the changing business environment. The\n\u2018last mile\u2019 between the job opportunity ad the potential candidate is a\ncrucial and vulnerable link - using technology to close that gap at the last\nmile with speed, accuracy and as per process is going to be central.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 5 Human Capital Management (HCM) Software Features for\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)\n\n## **Handle Change Meaningfully**\n\nIn conclusion, what needs to be kept in mind is that the right HCM solution\ncan prove to be a lot more than a system that simply manages data and\nprocesses better. It can be a tool to motivate your employees, to engage them\norganically and to provide an augmented employee experience through the\nduration of their employment or even career. That said, how well a Human\nCapital Management system functions within an organization depends on how well\nyou use it and how motivated your employees feel to adapt to the upgrade. In\nthe end, it\u2019s all about how you, the HR manager can HCM - handle change\nmeaningfully!\n\n**_Are you happy with the HCM system you use?

For an instant way to create,\nupdate and distribute your organizational chart, Microsoft Word comes equipped\nwith a tool that automatically generates hierarchical diagrams. All you have\nto do is add your personnel information and save the file.\n\n## Open the Document\n\nLaunch Microsoft Word. To add an organizational chart to an existing document,\nopen the file and scroll to the place for the chart. Press \u201cCtrl+Enter\u201d to add\na new page. Otherwise, Word starts a new blank document upon opening.\n\n## Open SmartArt\n\nClick the \u201cInsert\u201d tab. Click the \u201cSmartArt\u201d button on the ribbon, which opens\nthe \u201cChoose a SmartArt graphic\u201d pop-up window.\n\n## Select a Chart\n\nClick the \u201cHierarchy\u201d link in the left side column. Review the different\norganizational chart options. These are just the Word defaults \u2013 you will be\nable to change the colors and add rows and boxes in later steps. Double-click\na chart, such as \u201cOrganization Chart,\u201d that best suits your business. The\nchart is added to the Word document and a new purple \u201cSmartArt Tools\u201d tab and\nribbon open at the top of the work area.\n\n## Insert the Labels\n\nClick into the first/top box on the chart, which may show \u201c[Text]\u201d as the\ndefault. Type the name and, if desired, title of the highest-ranking person in\nyour organization, such as the CEO, CIO, president or owner.\n\n## Customize the Chart\n\nMove to the next box, which branches below the first. Type the name of the\nnext-highest person. Most Word templates have three boxes on this branch. If\nyou only have one or two people on this branch, click the box and press the\n\u201cDelete\u201d key. If you have more than three, click any box on the row, then\nclick the \u201cAdd Shape\u201d menu on the ribbon. Click \u201cAdd Shape After\u201d to add\nanother box on the same branch. Continue until all persons or job titles on\nthis level of your organization are represented.\n\n## Add Shapes\n\nClick a box on the second row. Click the \u201cAdd Shape\u201d menu and choose \u201cAdd\nShape Below.\u201d This creates the next, lower level in the organizational\nhierarchy. Add boxes, names and titles for each person on this level of your\ncompany. Continue to add boxes and rows. Note that as you add boxes, Word will\nautomatically shrink the chart to fit on the page.\n\n## Assign Positions to Each Person\n\nAssign administrative positions to the persons for whom they work by clicking\na box, then clicking the \u201cAdd Shape\u201d menu. Click \u201cAdd Assistant\u201d and a link is\ncreated from the executive to the assistant.\n\n## Add a Splash of Color\n\nClick the \u201cChange Colors\u201d button on the ribbon. Choose a different set of hues\nfrom the default Word blue. You can also change individual colors in the\nchart. Click a box or click multiple boxes by holding down the \u201cCtrl\u201d key and\nthen clicking each box to change. Right-click any of the selected boxes and\nchoose \u201cFormat Shape.\u201d In the \u201cFill\u201d window, choose a new color.\n\n## Save Your File\n\nClick the \u201cFile\u201d tab and select \u201cSave As.\u201d Type a name for the organizational\nchart and select where to save the file.

He freezes\n\n[![vic wahl at ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-4.26.15-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-4.26.15-AM.png)\n\nand we miss what he says - something about compromise and OIR report. It's not\nsomething they are pushing for. They are not in support of some of the\nlanguage added in during the committee process. He says that he hears, from\ntime to time in the community, an interest in revisiting body cameras, he\nthinks there is an interest in the community. He says several years have\npassed since the original committee discussed it, there are improvements to\ntechnology and its probably worth taking a fresh look at it if done properly.\n\nCarter ask Deputy Mayor Cam McLay or Alder Marsha Rummel - She says they have\nsignificant information from the past, including the community committee that\ncame and presented to the council that stated that the community in general\ndid not feel they would be any safer with police with body cameras or without.\nThat was at a time when they were looking at a pilot program and were going to\nbe given body cameras for a certain period of time. Will this group be\nutilizing some of that information we already have and not try to recreate the\nwheel and use that information.\n\n[![](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-4.28.08-AM-300x170.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-4.28.08-AM.png)\n\nBidar calls on McLay. He says that this wasn't necessarily a recommendation\nthat their office or the police department pushed forward. This comes from the\noriginal ad hoc final recommendations, the very last one, recommendation #177\ncalled for the creation of a committee to be comprised of members of the ad\nhoc, members of the original body camera study group and members of the MPD to\nexplore the questions from the OIR report and they specifically enumerate\nrecommendations 134-139. Those were all things relative to body worn cameras.\nFrom the standpoint of a value add, the offering of someone to look at the\nissue of body worn cameras that is something he thinks is a good idea. Meaning\nthe problem is very nuanced, very complex, if the Madison Police Department\never envisioned wanting to implement a body worn camera program, the only way\nthey'd be able to do it is with a really robust community engagement. So if\nthis body wants to focus its efforts on researching the body worn camera\nquestion, he thinks that would be a value add. The additional language Chief\nWahl mentioned that was added at the Equal Opportunities Commission -\nexpanding the scope of the committee is arguable a little less helpful. The\nlanguage added talks about \"the committee may address other issues relative to\nthe implementation of other recommendations in the ad hoc committee if\nrecommended by council. The TFOGS recommendations that we have fewer not more\ncommittees notwithstanding the challenge he says that we are proposing a task\nforce committee, not a standing one. A Task Force Committee really needs a\nspecific job we are asking them to do and a realistic time frame in which to\ndo it, a finite timeframe, whether it is an end date or a deliverable. This\nadditional language creates a level of complexity that he can envision to be\nproblematic, because it is duplicative of the role of the Public Safety Review\nCommittee. If the intention is to research body worn cameras and have this\ncommittee do it, he thinks it makes perfect sense from a change management\nstandpoint, because neither the MPD nor any of the rest of us have the\nbandwidth right now to research this topic. But if we want them to be\nexpanding to a host of other issues then we run into potential conflicts with\nthe role of the PSRC and conflict between the mayor's office, the police\ndepartment, HR who are working hard to implement the primary recommendation\nfrom the ad hoc which was the creation of the civilian auditor or monitor\nposition and the oversight committee to accompany it. All of their effort has\nbeen really focused on what the ad hoc committee said was most important to\nthem so to be focused on the concrete and body worn cameras he sees as adding\nvalue. To have duplicative roles creates confusion that might actually slow\ndown what is most important to us.\n\nBidar clarifies the motion before them is the original resolution. She doesn't\ncall on Alder Rummel to answer the question, but asks others if they have\nadditional questions.\n\n[![barbara harrington-mckinney at ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-4.33.33-AM-300x168.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-4.33.33-AM.png)\n\nAlder Barbara Harrington-McKinney asks if the findings of the original body\nworn cameras committee would be looked at and she says the answer is yes. She\nsays one of the discussions of the Public Safety Review Committee, one of the\nrequests is to take a look at the very robust conversation and the outcome of\nthat committee. We had requested to take a look back and see what the\noccurrences that happened in that committee and to re-read that report. She\nagrees we should have very defined and specific guidelines to produce the\noutcome that is intended by this committee.\n\nBidar asks for questions of staff.\n\n[![sambah baldeh at ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-4.38.54-AM-300x170.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-4.38.54-AM.png)\n\nAlder Samba Baldeh says this question might not be relevant now, but if this\ncommittee is approved and set up, what is the expected cost for cameras. Does\nanybody have any feeling around how much this will cost the city in case the\ncommittee recommends that we implement a pilot project or a full fledged body\nowned cameras for the police department.\n\nBidar directs the question to Chief Wahl.\n\nWahl says that when the previous committee was up and running they did some\ncost estimates and the cost estimate for a full operational deployment that\nthe body camera program was close to a million dollars and the pilot was in\nthe $90,000 range. They have not refreshed those numbers, that might change\ndepending on new tecnology, new costs, new server storage needs, but that's a\nballpark.\n\nBaldeh says that one thing that brought this conversation forward was the\nrelationship between police and communities around the country. Are you able\nto speak to where that is right now in regards to MPD and the community.\n\nWahl asks if he is asking about the general state of trust or how body cameras\nmight impact it.\n\nBaldeh says the relationship with the community, in the last few years it has\nbeen\u2026 communities of color and how they relate to police was not good, so the\nthinking was the having body worn cameras could help sometimes on the\nsuspicion around what is happening between the law enforcement community and\npeople of color. In other words, what necessitates looking at this again,\ngoing back to Sheri's previous question.\n\nWahl says on the question on how they are doing with public trust, he says he\nthinks they are in decent shape but the certainly have plenty of room for\nimprovement. Something they put a lot of time and effort into - building\nrelationships and poured a lot of resources and effort to, but certainly they\nhave plenty of room to grow and he personally doesn't view the body camera\nissue through that prism. There has been a lot of discussion about how body\ncameras will improve public trust and things like that but to him those felt\nsort of ancillary. He looks at it from a practitioner that in terms of having\nevidence, for internal complaints or criminal investigations, having that\nevidence of a body camera can help prosecution, it can help the city defend\nitself against frivolous lawsuits and things like that. We have in car video\nand the squad cameras that they have had for decades and they don't view those\nthrough a prism of public trust generally, its more for an operational\nexpectation of professional police agencies these days. There can be benefits\nto public trust in cases of critical incidents, because a body camera can give\nevidence that is impartial and that can help the community recognize what\nhappened, good or bad. So it can have some ancillary benefit to community\ntrust and support, but he doesn't view that as the core reason to . . .\n\n**Discussion**\n\n[![rebecca kemble at ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-4.51.42-AM-300x168.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-4.51.42-AM.png)\n\nAlder Rebecca Kemble moves an amendment adoption the language that was adopted\nat the Equal Opportunities Commission. It is seconded by Alder Tag Evers.\n\nAlder Kemble says this is a long strange trip that is ending up with this and\nthe next item on the agenda, item number 6, requesting that the MPD produce a\nsummary document of MPD Policy and Procedure Ad Hoc Committee recommendations.\nShe says when they adopted the report of the Ad Hoc Committee they changed the\nlanguage to adopt it as well as adopting their recommendations which were\nmodified by both the PSRC and the Equal Opportunities Commission at the time\nto set up a committee and in the language of that recommendation it said an\noversight committee and then it specifically reference for body cams #177\nrecommendations. Both the PSRC and the EOC felt it was very important for\nthose that had been working on the recommendations to be able to assist the\ncommon council as we provided our oversight over this policy that we adopted.\nBoth of those bodies also added to the recommendation that this new committee\nshould be made up of former ad hoc committee Madison Police and Policy Ad Hoc\nCommittee members, former body cam committee members and one member from PSRC\nand one member from EOC. Because both of those bodies had a keen intention and\ninterest on following up, not just on body cams but in all of the\nrecommendations. At the EOC meeting, the EOC members were asking what happened\nto our recommendation? They asked for the committee to be tracking all the\nrecommendations and the answer to that is that original intention got framed\ninto these two items, split off so that MPD is doing the matrix of all the\nrecommendations and then this committee is just looking at body worn camera,\nthose 4 recommendations in #177. At EOC we voted 6-1 to add this language \"Be\nit further resolved that the committee may address issues related to the\nimplementation of other recommendations from the ad hoc committee report if\nreferred to them by the common council.\" That gives us, as we monitor based on\nitem #6 coming up, based on a report we get from MPD, as we monitor those\nthings, we can have access to the people who developed the recommendations,\nwho will be sitting on this committee, if we have any questions or concerns,\nwe want their formal input on. We can always get input from individuals one by\none coming to us as we take up the whole of the recommendations, but that\ntends to give certain individuals outsized influence in the process and not\neveryone is motivated every time to track our agenda and see when this is\ncoming up. They thought having this committee as back up for us, for them to\nbe able to think together and mull over and debate within themselves instead\nof just having individual opinions about how other recommendations are being\nimplemented, would be good for us as public policy makers and as the body\ntasked with overseeing the implementation of all of these adopted\nrecommendations.\n\nAlder Carter says if the council is able to add other items for them to look\nat is this task force turning into a permanent committee, or does the task\nforce have a sunset and the second question is if they are to provide us with\na report, is this another instance where we have to hire a consultant to write\nthe report for the task force.\n\n[![keith furman at ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.10.17-AM-300x170.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.10.17-AM.png)\n\nAlder Keith Furman shares concerns that Alder Carter pointed out with the\nmodification of this committee, he understands the request to do the body worn\ncamera, that is a specific recommendation, but he is fearful of letting that\ncommittee have scope creep and do a lot more stuff, where does that end. Why\nwouldn't we be using the Public Safety Review Committee or the Oversight\nCommittee that will be in place at some point, or re-instituting the Ad Hoc\nMPD Policy and Procedure Committee. It seems like this is going to be a much\nmore complicated committee than what the original intent was and he thinks\nthat is a mistake.\n\nKemble says that this is a little over half of the former ad hoc committee and\nthe reason to use this instead of PSRC because they are literally the people\nwho developed the recommendations and understand the spirit and understand the\ndiscussions and everything that went into creating them. The PSRC does not\nhave that capacity. If we as a council, are having questions about what did\nthey mean about recommendations, is the way its being implemented in sync with\nthat, that we have them as a resource to go to and she doesn't think its\nadding a ton more work, its something we as a council can have in our back\npocket to inform our decisions in a much more robust way. This resolution has\na sunset of December 31st of this year. Our abilitty to have them as a\nresource isn't an undue scope creep.\n\nBaldeh is wondering why is it that we cannot get the police department to give\nthe same report. For equity purposes it is important that we have a new set of\neyes on this committee as opposed to using the same old folks, not that they\nhave not been doing an excellent job, but for equity purposes, it is important\nto have another set of eyes to look at this.\n\n[![grant foster ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.10.45-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.10.45-AM.png)\n\nAlder Grant Foster asks Attorney May about if they have the ability as a\ncommon council to refer an additional item if it is created if the language is\nnot in the forming resolution, or does the language have to be included in\norder for us to be able to refer some other item to it.\n\n[![mike may ccec](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.11.06-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.11.06-AM.png)\n\nCity Attorney Mike May says normally the resolution they adopt sets the\nauthority and jurisdiction of any ad hoc body. That says what you want them to\nlook at. And if you decide you want something else to be looked at you would\neither amend the resolution and say we want to give them additional\nauthorities or set up a new body or adopt a new resolution to send something\nto them that wasn't in the original one. Yes, if somewhere down the road you\ndecide there is something else you want this committee or any other ad hoc\ncommittee to look at you can introduce a resolution and say we are referring\nthis matter to this body and we amend their charter to be able to take up this\nissue.\n\nFoster clarifies that if they want to do this the recommendation is to amend\nthis resolution at that time and do a referral subsequent to that. We wouldn't\nbe able to just refer something without changing the resolution.\n\nCity staff explains how to raise their hands.\n\n[![](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.11.31-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.11.31-AM.png)\n\nAlder Heck says that also in legistar is the PSRC's recommendation that's\nslightly more focused and suggests that we add language that allows other\nitems to be referred to this committee if they are camera related. And PSRC\nrecognized that it is a little bit subjective as to if something is cam\nrelated, but it opens up possibilities but also narrows the scope. He can't\nspeak for all of PSRC, but when we considered this item I repeatedly said that\nI felt like PSRC was not the appropriate body to be taking up these matters\nbecause we don't have the expertise that the ad hoc committee members have and\nthe surveillance committee have and he feels pretty strongly we should take\nadvantage of their expertise.\n\n[![](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.13.48-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.13.48-AM.png)\n\nAlder Arvina Martin is concerned that the scope isn't entirely focused and\nthere is kind of a creep. She is worried about the clarity with the amendment.\n\nFoster asks the body to think about in this moment where we are running on\nlimited board and committee and commissions right now. None of us know exactly\nwhen things are going to turn around, he is hopeful we will be able to have\nmore of our existing BCCs meeting soon. He is wondering about the timeline, is\nit realistic? Should we be forming this now and with the timeline of having\nthe work done by the end of the year if we are still in a place where we have\nexisting committees that are unable to meet due to technology capacity via\nvirtual meetings. He is asking his colleagues this question as much as\nanything.\n\nHarrington-McKinney says these are the issues she has a concern about, 1) we\ndo need to have a fresh set of eyes, especially when Alder Kemble said that\none half of the original committee. . . The opportunity to take the work and\nlook at it with fresh eyes. She disagrees with her colleague on the Public\nSafety Review Committee because one of the things is to have a robust\ncommunity engagement, and what does that look like. The charge of the Public\nSafety Review Committee - one of those is undergoing a robust public\nengagement. That is one of their charges and they are well qualified to do\nthat. Her other concern is how rigorous the original ad hoc committee would\nbe, because it is their work and there is a protection of that work but how\nrigorous would that be and would the opportunity come for us to look at it in\na significant way with new eyes. She thinks there is a possibility of scope\ncreep, she says being specific with what this is related to is very important\nbecause when there is a scope creep there is no definitive beginning or end\nand it can devolve into what Alder Carter said - is this going to be a\npermanent committee and its not designed to be that way. The PSRC has\nresidents on this committee, it has alders on that committee, the past co-\nchair of the committee sits on the PSRC, they have the ability to call in to\ntheir meeting testimony from other individuals. It is well equiped and well\nable to take this charge on and to not include the PSRC, it ignore that is\nexactly the opposite of what we are trying to do in terms of making the\ncommittees efficient.\n\nBidar asks permission to speak on the amendment and the underlying motion. She\nis not supportive of the amendment, she feels it creates a broad scope for the\ncommittee and she thinks committee work is better done when the scope is\nclear. She supports creating the body worn camera review committee as\nrecommended by the ad hoc committee. This resolution brings that\nrecommendation (#177) forward. She thinks having members of the ad hoc\ncommittee on the body worn camera visibility review committee is a good way to\nhave a balance of people who have had the conversations, the knowledge and\nexperience, with adding a couple other people - a representative from PSRC and\nEOC who will bring a fresh perspective to the conversation. One of the reasons\nshe is not supportive of adding a broad scope for this committee is that as\nyou all know, the main recommendation was to create the oversight committee\nand auditor and she feels that a lot of the additional scope of work will need\nto fall withing the role of the oversight committee, which will be made of up\nof residents of our city and will be able to take on the additional role and\nthe oversight committee will be made up of a group of individuals, maybe some\nmembers of the ad hoc committee, but others too. She feels its important to\nmove forward with the body worn camera review committee, with the narrow\nscope. And at the same time its a lot of work, that still needs to happen.\nUnderstanding what Carter said, that work has been done in the past, but it is\ntime to pick up that work again and revisit the recommendations and come\nforward with a set of potentially revised recommendations to the council on\nhow to move forward.\n\nHarrington-McKinney says she will not be supporting this as well, it does\npresent the opporunity overall to pass this work on, to review the work of the\nbody worn camera committee - that document is on a shelf, so pick that up and\nrevisit that, to have a very defined narrow scope so that work can be passed\non through the oversight committee. To have this take its place will interfere\nwith the ability . . . cuts out. . . to have commission members and members\nfrom a broader spectrum of the community than what we see now, so she will not\nbe supporting this amendment.\n\nKemble says that there has been a lot of confusion about what we are saying\nwhen we talk about oversight committee. She thinks there are at least three\ndifferent things 1) The citizen review board with the recommendation for an\nindependent monitor, we passed that last year, prior to accepting and adopting\nthis report because we recognized as a council that was so important, and\ncritical to the foundation of any work we do. That has nothing to do with the\nad hoc committee. Those are two things we are in some degree of process of\nalready doing. Then, when the report came there was the recommendation of an\noversight to oversee the implementation of all of these recommendations. THat\nwas separate from the citizens review board. And then we have the proposal\nthat came out of the recommendations for an oversight of the recommendations\nto be just the body cam things. We need to be careful about the language.\nBecause the citizen's review board is going to be that ultimate oversight\ncommittee that works with the independent monitor that will not be one of our\ncommittees. It's a different animal altogether.\n\n**Amendment vote** - to increase the scope of the committee if referred by the\ncommon council.\n\nAYE - Evers, Foster, Kemble\n\nNO - Bidar, Harrington-McKinney, Martin, Carter\n\nBaldeh is an alternate, so he doesn't vote if everyone is present.\n\nAmendment fails\n\nThe underlying motion passes unanimously.\n\nThis took the first 50 minutes of the meeting\n\n  * [Requesting that the Madison Police Department create a summary document of MPD Policy and Procedure Review Ad Hoc Committee Recommendations.](http://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=70768)\n\nBidar reminds the alders that a motion to refer may be appropriate on some\nitems.\n\n**Questions of Staff**\n\nNone\n\n**Discussion**\n\nKemble says she has a question for all of us, we will be getting this document\non May 5th, 2020 and yet we understand that it will be a progress report, that\nis how we envisioned it and she would like them to talk about if they want\nthis to be a living document, do we want the May 5th document to be a first\ndraft and have continual updates to CCEC, because I doubt they will be able to\nimplement 177 recommendations by May 5th. So question for the body is how they\nwill use the document to ensure the recommendations are done.\n\nBidar asks if there is anyone who wants to discuss this issue.\n\nHarrington-McKinney (cut out) ___ meets on a regular basis and in that meeting\nthey could have that report by the police, we could make that a living\ndocument and it could be part of the update that the police department does to\nthe Public Safety Review Committee moving forward.\n\nNo additional comments.\n\nBidar asks if it is unanimous.\n\nBaldeh asks why the MPD can't just give the updates, why do we have to create\nthis.\n\nBidar asks if that is a question for the body?\n\nBaldeh says it is for MPD or the sponsors of the resolution.\n\nBidar says its more appropriate to the sponsors of the resolution because MPD\ndidn't suggest it.\n\nBidar asks if anyone wants to answer the question.\n\nBaldeh says if no one is answering it, he says he'll ask the City Attorney.\n\nBidar says Alder Kemble would like to answer it.\n\nKemble says that Bidar, Rummel, Albouras and her as sponsors and she spoke\nextensively with Alder Bidar around creating this and in our discussions it\nhad to do with creating a tool for the council, because we are the body that\nis ultimately responsible for overseeing this. Having a tool to keep track of\nthis enormous body of work. To track the progress of all of the\nrecommendations. It's a tool for MPD to use and us to use as we move forward\nimplementing the recommendations, its an organizational tool.\n\nBidar has nothing to add, Kemble described it correctly.\n\nCarter says there are 177 recommendations and this could be to the sponsors or\nMPD. Of the 177 recommendations, are we saying all of them fit the MPD or are\nthe looking at the recommendations that fit them.\n\nBidar says that the idea is that the grid or document would point out which\nagency is the lead agency to implement the recommendation, some will be MPD,\nsome will be MPD plus another agency, some won't be MPD. It's asking MPD to\ncreate the summary document.\n\nCarter asks if there is a recommendation that does not fit, if its MPD or\nanother agency with MPD, is that something that they will report on.\n\nBidar says right now the only request is for them to create the summary grid,\nnot to do other reporting, just present the summary document to us, and we can\ndecide from that if we want regular reporting by anybody. What is before us is\nnot reporting, its just creating one summary document.\n\nThey move to a vote again.\n\nThey do a roll call - you can hear a dog barking.\n\nRoll call is unanimous.\n\n#### **SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS**\n\n  * [Accepting the Final Report of the President\u2019s Work Group to Develop City-wide Surveillance Equipment and Data Management Policies.](http://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=70262)\n  * [Creating Section 23.63 of the Madison General Ordinances to establish Surveillance Technology guidelines for Departments](http://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=70305)\n\nCarter moves approval of 7 & 8.\n\nKemble moves to refer to next meeting to have the committee of the whole\ndiscussion.\n\nBidar asks if Carter would entertain a motion to referral or would you like us\nto accept it.\n\nCarter changes her motion to referral for 7 & 8.\n\nBidar says Attorney May doesn't like that but the motion is for referral, by\nCarter, second by Kemble.\n\nNo one speaks to referral.\n\nPasses by unanimous consent.\n\nAttorney May asks when they are referring it to, to the next meeting?\n\nBidar says next meeting.\n\nUnanimous vote to refer.\n\nThis is the first full hour of the meeting that was a little short of two\nhours.\n\n#### **COVID-19 RESPONSE**\n\n  * [Briefing by Mayor Rhodes-Conway on COVID-19 Response](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4407075&GUID=76D24466-FB68-47D1-93E0-2A6A3189D5FF) (<\\- link decoy)\n\nHer presentation is in a [separate post\nhere](https://www.forwardlookout.com/2020/04/madison-mayors-briefing-to-ccec-\non-covid-19-response/31536).\n\n[![mayor covid-19 response](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.12.04-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.12.04-AM.png)\n\n**Questions or committee of the whole and have a conversation?**\n\nBidar asks the above question.\n\nBarbara Harrington-McKinney moves to move to the committee of the whole,\nbecause that allows all of them to weigh in on having a conversation and that\nis the piece that is missing.\n\nTag Ever's seconds.\n\nBidar announces they are now in a committee of the whole without a vote and\nthey will discuss the Mayor's briefing to them and specifically next steps or\nthoughts about the role of the council during this COVID-19 emergency.\n\n  * [Discussion: Role of Council and Communication during COVID 19 Emergency](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4406821&GUID=7C7C7732-C10D-48B8-AD2B-89B3ABE442B4) (<\\- link decoy)\n\nSamba Baldeh asks about the homeless population, he knows some of them have\nbeen calling him asking questions that he doesn't have answers to, and I refer\nthem to the city. His question is if anyone knows if all the homeless people\nare sheltered at this point. His second question is the non-english speakers.\nObviously he comes from a community where a majority of those do not speak\nenglish so he wants to know what the outreach is like in regards to those\ncommunities.\n\nBidar calls a point of order, because everyone is text her with different\nideas. We are in a committee of the whole, Attorney May, can you quickly\nexplain how we participate in a committee of the whole and who is part of the\ncommittee of the whole.\n\nAttorney May says that the basic thing is that you dispense with the normal\nRobert's Rules of order and you can have a conversation back and forth,\nmembers of the body can ask other members of the body questions directly, the\nchair still has to maintain some sort of order in terms of where you go as it\nadvances, that will still be left on you. He doesn't think they ought to be\ntexting you questions, they ought to try to raise them and in the committee of\nthe whole, its possible that even those members that are not members of the\ncommittee can participate because that is allowed under the rules for council\nmembers at any committee meeting. You could open it up to anyone there, that\nmight get a little unwieldy, but he thinks it would be allowed under the\ncommittee of the whole rules. Is there something else I didn't touch on that\nyou wanted me to specifically address?\n\nBidar says that is good, she wanted everyone to know because they are asking\nquestions.\n\n**Questions of the Mayor**\n\nShe says now it is questions of the Mayor, but for those of you who want to\nhave a question amongst alders, that this is the time to have that\nconversation.

Go ahead. Somehow its not working. Mayor says \"stop\".\n\nMayor says that they are asking folks who are experiencing homelessness to\nconnect through the regular providers, because that is who is able to refer\nthem to the correct shelter at this point. If they are in a high risk\ncategory, they would be referred to a hotel, otherwise they would be referred\nto an existing shelter. That is the correct thing to do, to continue to\nconnect them with the Homeless Services Providers. She believes they are\naccommodating all of the requests as they come in. At some point they will\nneed additional facilities to do that, but at the moment they are\naccommodating.\n\nIn terms of outreach to non-english speaking populations, that is one of the\nthings the JIC is taking on this week, they have been regularly translating\ninto Spanish, but working on getting more information out in plain language in\nall languages and also in Hmong and Mandarin. Spanish, Hmong and Mandarin\nbeing the top languages in addition to English. They have other language\nresources and will be able to roll out more of those over time.\n\n[![](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.14.31-AM-300x168.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.14.31-AM.png)\n\nAlder Tag Evers wants to remind his colleagues that we voted not to ask\nquestions of the Mayor at this time, we can submit questions at a later date\nor moment, but we agreed to discuss among ourselves in a committee of the\nwhole about the appropriate role for common council and for CCEC in the time\nof crisis.

Thanks Mayor for\nreport. She says that as a person who is trying to follow the new protocol I\nkind of feel at a loss. I send it to Kwasi and I'm not comfortable yet with\nthe way the council is participating. It feels like we are off on the\nsidelines - even in the flow chart, we're not even our own important body of\nthe flow chart. She would like to ask the council if we're not going to be\npart of the EOC, which I think we should consider, can we have a member who\nhas daytime availability participate more regularly in some of the discussion.\nIf that is not considered a direction we want to take, can Common Council and\nCommon Council Executive Committee meet every week so we're not rushed for\ntime like we have 18 minutes. And we can really have these robust information\nsharing so we don't feel like we are only getting a little brief summary at\nthe end of the day. This was not a brief summary at the end of the day, this\nwas what we as policy makers need to know and share with our constituents. We\nneed more of this, she doesn't want to be like the second class part of this\ngovernment and that is kind of how she feels right now. But I support all that\nwe are doing, I don't feel mad at you or anything, I just want us to know our\nrole and be more active in sharing the responsibility.\n\n[![](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-01-at-5.13.09-AM-300x169.png)](https://www.forwardlookout.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-5.13.09-AM.png)\n\nSally Rohrer was going to say exactly what Alder Rummel said, especially about\nmeeting more regularly, she thinks that is really important especially if we\nare talking about doing recovery planning or starting to think about recovery\npolicy outside of what is already happening. We need to be having\nconversations more regularly and getting these verbal updates. She thinks this\nscratched the surface of all that is going on at that city. Having these more\nregularly would be more helpful. Also, echoing what Alder Rummel said about\nhaving alders involved in the EOC process, she knows there are 4 umbrella\ngroups that have staff members under them, maybe alders could also serve as a\npart of those groups or at least be privy to conversations and meeting that\nare happening and the planning and operations, logistics and finance\numbrellas.\n\nAlder Keith Furman says this has been a difficult time trying to figure out -\nobviously as alders we run because we want to make a difference and help - and\nit has been difficult trying to figure out what is our role. He appreciates\nthe Mayor and administration and EOC and what they have done, its going to be\nincredibly difficult for us to put ourselves in EOC, we are part time alders\nwith other responsibilities, its not our job to manage the process. But we\nneed to find a better balance to figure out how to be more involved. I think\nthat message is becoming clearer. We also need to remember as alders that it\ntakes a lot of time to set up these meetings, come to these meetings, get\nupdates for these meetings, I\"m sure the mayor didn't throw together that\nupdate in a few minutes, I'm sure she spent a ton of time on it. He thinks its\nimportant for us to get an idea of what is going on so we can stay informed\nand be involved, but figure out that balance where we are not taking a ton of\neffort that is taking place in EOC and throughout the city. He repeats himself\n- we should be focusing on the recovery, that is one way for us not to slow\ndown EOC, but also be useful in something that is going to be incredibly\nimportant. I think the landscape of the city and this country is going to\nchange dramatically as this goes on longer.\n\nAlder Grant Foster says he agrees with a lot of what has been said and looking\nat the clock it is 6:16 pm for our unprecedented first virtual common council\nmeeting to start. Practically he'd like to put out there that we should, and\nperhaps attorney May can give us what our options are, but he thinks we should\nbe talking about setting up another meeting whether its CCEC or Common Council\nmeeting. Whether that has to be an emergency meeting since its not in the\nschedule. Talk about the timing for that and do something in the next several\ndays even or early next week so we can have a much more robust committee of\nthe whole conversation because it is not going to happen today and he thinks\nthere is a lot on people's minds that we need to sort out. This is\nunprecedented for all of us, there is alot of desire by people to participate\nand start thinking about what our role is, so he thinks we need to right now\nthink about when we are going to do this work, because its not going to happen\nin the next 3 minutes.\n\nBidar puts some ideas out there, this is not something that she has not been\nthinking about, things have been moving very fast and she has been\nparticularly busy in her day job. She thinks it was good of one of the alders\nto remind everybody that some of us certainly have a lot of balances that we\nhave to make as part-time alders. Her proposal was going to be to have another\nCCEC meeting on April 14th, but she would entertain having a CCEC meeting next\nweek. She would want to see us do, collectively, maybe as subgroups and\nAttorney May could lead us to how we do that, to come back to CCEC with some\nproposed planning from each of us. We have a group of very, very engaged - all\nof us can put together some ideas of the roles - so we can start our\nconversation at CCEC based on some ideas and proposals that have been put\nforth and discuss those as opposed ot just starting again from scratch and\nputting ideas out there and having to take a next step of putting those ideas\nback in writing. If that sounds like a possibility for all of you who are on\nthis Zoom, she would like to know, some affirmation or collective about 1) do\nwe want to meet as CCEC next week and 2) are people willing to have\nassignments given to them of things they could do to prepare for the next CCEC\nmeeting so they can talk through the different roles and things the council\ncould be doing. One of the clear ones that has come up is recovery planning -\nthat is something that right now, the Mayor's focus needs to be with the day-\nto-day operations - that is a role we can take and thinking about whether we\ncould divide that recovering planning around areas of interest like housing,\nemployment, small business, food, transportation, and have different groups of\nalders based on their interests work on what a subgroup working on those\nthings look like, that would be one way of doing it, or we can just divide and\nhave people work on their series of ideas on the role of the council going\nforward and bring that to CCEC. Those are her ideas and she would entertain\nany reaction to that in the next 5 minutes, because we all need a break before\nwe zoom back in.\n\nMartin prefers the idea of assignments, she feels like right now is not the\ntime to go independently, that is how we start duplicating ideas and we don't\nneed to be worried about that right now, and she would like to make sure we\nhave our bases covered especially with planning for recovery and she thinks\nthat would be the most efficient way to move forward.\n\nBidar asks about meeting next week or in two weeks.\n\nMartin says totally, we should do it.\n\nEvers is in favor of meeting next week, he thinks the discussion is not just\nabout the tasks that are before us, but also our responsibility and obligation\nas our effective role. He is not satisfied with the flow chart. He feels like\nthe Council has been pushed off to the side and this body needs to seriously\nquestion our role in the event of an emergency. It's not just about finding\nsome task we can do in the future, but its asserting our statutory obligations\nas elected officials who are the legislative body in this city, and we have\nthat obligation and responsibility and we need to discuss how we are going to\nfulfill that responsibility.\n\nKemble says yes to meeting next week and she would like some of us to work\nwith attorney May to talk about rapid council response to issues that come up\nand how we can rapidly respond as a body or as CCEC and she feels like they\nneed legal advice on that, she would be willing to work with Attorney May on\nthat before the next meeting.\n\nCarter says yes for meeting next week, she assumes its next Tuesday and she\nwould like to work on small businesses and economic recovery and anyone that\nwants to join her on that would be fine.\n\nBidar says she hopes Kwasi is taking good notes or can listen to the\nrecording. She thanks Alder Carter for the very specific answer.\n\nHeck says that he agrees with what everyone said, he just wants to add that if\nwe are going to work some of us on recovery efforts it seems inevitable that\nit is another reason why alders plugging in to EOC is a good thing. Because he\nsees those efforts as eventually being very tied together and he hopes they\ncan find a way to do that at the next meeting.\n\nFoster says yes to meeting next week. A couple things he thinks should be on\nthe list are 1) taking a look at the information flows between Council and EOC\nin both directions and revisiting the expectations there, including maybe more\nfrequent briefings. 2) Looking at boards, committees and commissions and\nworking on having the council create a list of meetings that we want to see\nhappen over the next several months and 3) getting a sense of what our virtual\nmeeting capabilities are and the protocols that we are using for common\ncouncil and other BCCs.\n\nBidar says there are no other hands, it's the hour of 6:24 so she is hearing a\nmeeting next week, so she will take that on and Vice President Harrington-\nMcKinney and herself can work on setting that meeting up for next week with\ncollaboration with our IT team who supports all of our wonderful meetings. And\nare probably already feeling like this is yet another meeting and we have a\ncouncil meeting yet to come. They will try to summarize everything that people\nproposed they discuss and then please expect some of these ideas to be coming\nback to you as the person who brought them forward to work on more detail\naround, so you can present to CCEC next week if that is ok with everybody.\nThey will also schedule another CCEC for April 14 which was already kind of in\nthe plan so that way the have more week covered. They are not able to meet\nnext week on April 7th, because it is still election day. So they will find\nanother date and the 6th is Finance Committee, so they will find another date,\nWed. or Thursday next week to meet and they will be back in touch. Thank you\neverybody for taking the time to join the CCEC meeting today. We have one\nother item.\n\n  * [Update: President\u2019s Work Group to Review Applicable APM\u2019s (3/31/20)](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4390929&GUID=B9CC1D3A-8B5D-4DB6-A0F8-4AE209AE06E7) \u2013 Ald.

2008, Michael Gao was tasked by his boss at the D.C. Veterans Affairs\nMedical Center to find a way to digitize the resource management process.\n\nAfter examining several web-based collaboration platforms, Gao and his team of\nsoftware developers came up with an[ open-source\nsolution](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/LEAF) called Light Electronic\nAction Framework, or LEAF, that has since spread like wildfire across VA, the\nsecond-largest federal agency.\n\nToday, tens of thousands of VA employees\u2014most of whom are not skilled software\nprofessionals\u2014across more than 100 VA medical centers use LEAF to digitize\nclinic cancelations, onboard employees and manage resources.\n\nTravel and tuition reimbursements, employee and resource requests, phone\nbooks, organizational charts and document trackers all now run through LEAF,\nwhich is centrally hosted by VA while meeting the government\u2019s security and\ndata reporting requirements.\n\nThrough a growing internal community of VA LEAF users, each new application on\nthe platform is evangelized or crowdsourced, ultimately leading to better\nmission delivery at VA.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to leverage all these people building custom solutions and then\npackage them in a way we can deploy, much like we currently deploy\nstandardized electronic forms,\u201d Gao told _Nextgov_ in an interview following\nVA\u2019s annual LEAF conference in April.\n\nGao, who makes a hobby of automating repeated manual processes, is all about\nease of use and usability. If one VA medical center benefits from a unique\napplication on LEAF, he said, why not \u201cmake it as easy as possible for another\nmedical center to download and use\u201d it. You don\u2019t have to be a tech geek or\ncoding guru to use LEAF either, Gao said, adding that many of the coolest LEAF\ninnovations stemmed from frontline, non-technical employees who tackled common\nproblems.\n\nAt the conference hosted in Arlington, Virginia, dozens of VA employees from\nacross the country pitched some of these LEAF case studies to VA executives,\nhighlighting how LEAF has improved employee engagement, saved agency resources\nand improved veteran experience and patient care.\n\nRepresenting Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford,\nMassachusetts, Frank Stathas said LEAF reduced the time to hire and onboard\nnew employees from 120 days to 80 days.\n\nThe hospital initially adopted LEAF in 2018 to automate travel authorizations,\nbut eventually used it to create \u201ca one-stop shop hiring portal that would\nallow us to integrate all hiring activity, from the initial supervisor request\nto new employee orientation.\u201d\n\nCritical vacancies are reported through LEAF in real time, as opposed to\nthrough dozens of emails or word of mouth, Stathas said, with a net result of\nimproving patient care.\n\n\u201c[LEAF] helps us recruit the best-qualified staff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe portal will\nhave a positive impact on the veteran experience and supports the VA\nsecretary\u2019s priority to modernize IT systems. Through LEAF, we envision a big\ndrop in vacancies.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, VA Midsouth Healthcare Network in Nashville, Tennessee, uses LEAF\nas a recruitment tracking tool. The system replaced paper-intensive processes\nthat included manually tracking up to 200 recruitments on a single Excel\nspreadsheet, according to Jalandra Miller. In crunch time, Miller said those\nspreadsheets had a tendency to crash.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for the patient, not the paper,\u201d Miller said. \u201cLEAF recruitment\ntracker has taken away my need to track recruitment items on individual\nspreadsheets. It makes us accountable to use the systems we\u2019re supposed to\nuse.\u201d\n\nFrontline VA employees reported dozens of other LEAF use cases, such as\nreduced times to reschedule veteran patient appointments, tracking quality-of-\ncare indicators and budgeting data. Taken together, LEAF use cases pitched at\nthe conference alone saved VA tens of thousands of hours and perhaps millions\nof dollars in costs. They also indicate the growing import placed on employee\nexperience within the agency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about employee engagement, and to see this is amazing,\u201d said Lee Becker,\nchief of staff for the Veterans Experience Office.\n\nBecker was among VA\u2019s leadership team on-hand at the LEAF conference. He\ncredited VA\u2019s employees for the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s lofty public\ntrust rating, which he said sits at 87 percent. That compares favorably to\npublic trust in government overall, which Becker said hovers at 22 percent.\n\nLEAF, Becker said, \u201cis a secret, but shouldn\u2019t be a secret.\u201d\n\nBlake Henderson, VA\u2019s Innovation Coordinator, describes LEAF as a way to \u201ckeep\nsmall problems from becoming big ones,\u201d allowing low-code or no-code avenues\nfor VA employees to problem solve. One of Henderson\u2019s key duties is telling\nVA\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d innovation and evangelizing the LEAF-enabled work in VA to the\nrest of the agency and the broader federal community.\n\n\u201cOne common thread unites these diverse LEAF applications\u2014front-line personnel\nsaw a problem in their workplace and used LEAF to solve it,\u201d Henderson said in\na[ blog post](https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/59845/crowdsourcing-government-\ninnovation-leaf-effect/) Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs LEAF reaches different VA constituencies, employees are using it in\nremarkable ways\u2014uses that go beyond what its developer thought possible.\u201d\n\nFor LEAF, the cloud\u2014not the sky\u2014may be the limit. VA plans to move LEAF to an\nAmazon-hosted cloud in the near future, which Gao said will increase the kinds\nof applications and projects LEAF can tackle. Because of the cloud\u2019s improved\nsecurity features, LEAF projects could extend to more sensitive data types.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll now have the authorization and capability to store sensitive\ninformation\u2014something that\u2019s always been missing from our platform,\u201d Gao said.\n\nShare This:\n\n  *

A single innovative idea can\ntransform a company. A successful small-scale trial can establish a new\nbusiness model. An individual who speaks up about a problem can trigger\nsubstantive evolution. And all employees, wherever they are in the\norganizational chart, are continuously offered chances to prove themselves and\neffect change -- even if they're not always aware of them. In fact, even the\nmost marginal task and project has the capacity to lead to something much\nbigger.\n\nI've seen it personally in my own career in the media. But it wasn't until I\nsaw this dynamic played out in an\n[episode](https://friends.fandom.com/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Smokes) of the\nclassic sitcom _Friends_ that I discovered the words to summarize this\ntransformative way of thinking.\n\n## Related stories\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/To-strengthen-innovation-make-sure-every-voice-is-heard)\n\ns+b Blogs\n\n### [To strengthen innovation, make sure every voice is\nheard](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/To-strengthen-innovation-make-\nsure-every-voice-is-heard)\n\nby Josh Levs\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/How-to-discover-your-organizations-story)\n\ns+b Blogs\n\n### [How to discover your organization's story](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/blog/How-to-discover-your-organizations-story)\n\nby Josh Levs\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/The-fortune-at-the-bottom-of-the-org-chart)\n\ns+b Blogs\n\n### [The fortune at the bottom of the org chart](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/blog/The-fortune-at-the-bottom-of-the-org-chart)\n\nby Josh Levs\n\nThe [story line](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583475/) revolved around two\ncharacters, Monica and Phoebe, who were throwing a birthday party for Rachel.\nMonica, the archetypal control freak, naturally insisted on organizing\neverything. Phoebe wanted to play a role. But Monica, a chef and caterer,\ndidn't trust flighty Phoebe to organize any of the details. So she told Phoebe\nshe could be in charge of the cups and ice.\n\nTo anyone with a typical mentality, being in charge of two seemingly boring\nproducts like cups and ice would feel like the ultimate form of\nmarginalization. Sure, they're necessary for a party, but they're an\nafterthought. The task takes no creativity or ambition -- and very little\ncompetence.\n\nBut Phoebe, in her offbeat way, took a divergent approach. She seized upon\nthis rote task and used her imagination. She filled the party with all types\nof ice, including buckets of crushed ice, snow cones, and dry ice. She\ndecorated the apartment with bouquets of cups and used some as party hats. To\nMonica's chagrin, it became a [cups and ice\nparty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hn8WBV9rlc).\n\nIn any organization, the reality is that there are always a host of tasks that\nare treated as less important or marginal, and from which people may recoil.\nIt is easy to regard them as chores to be completed as quickly and efficiently\nas possible, and to overlook the contributions of those who carry them out.\nBut for ambitious employees, these can be significant opportunities to display\ncreativity and commitment. A seemingly small opportunity can ultimately be a\nbig chance to show what you're capable of.\n\nFor ambitious employees, tasks that are treated as less important or marginal\ncan be significant opportunities to display creativity and commitment.\n\nI was interning at a local public radio station when I convinced my boss to\ngive me a chance to do a single report on air. She praised the report and told\nme to feel free to do more. She expected I'd probably put together one report\na month. But she had placed no limit. So instead, I immediately began doing\nfive reports a day, then quickly began reporting for the network, NPR. I got\nto bring all sorts of stories that I was passionate about (including on civil\nrights and race relations) to a national audience.\n\nYears later, I wanted to create an on-air role at CNN. I couldn't (and still\ncan't) stand seeing all the false claims that politicians and pundits made\nlive on air. I wanted to do \"reality check\" segments tackling as many claims\nas possible. When the boss finally gave me a shot, his exact words were to\n\"try it on the weekend\" (a time slot when fewer star correspondents were\npushing for airtime). He and others expected that I'd do one or perhaps two\nreports each weekend.\n\nBut I realized that since the weekend is 48 hours long, I could go in\nextremely early and stay late on Saturday and Sundays. As a result, instead of\ndoing a single spot, I did numerous stories throughout each weekend. Once the\nnetwork saw their value, I was able to expand the segments to weekdays.\n\nThe trick for all of us is to identify the seemingly limited opportunities --\nthe assignment to bring the cups and the ice -- and parlay them into something\nlarger. Make sure colleagues are aware of the work you've done, ask for and\nreceive feedback, and demonstrate an ability to improve on the next go-round.\n\nAmplifying the value of the marginal opportunity requires a certain amount of\nself-promotion. See if you can get a write-up about it in your company's\n[intranet](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-workplace/why-intranets-are-still-\nkey-digital-workplace-networks/) or newsletter. Encourage your boss to give\nyour project a shout-out during a company-wide meeting. Offer to run workshops\nfor other teams showing how they can do the same, or something similar.\n\nLeaders have a role to play as well. It is important that they listen to new\nideas, make sure employees feel empowered to present those ideas, and are open\nto the notion that operational and cultural growth can come from unexpected\nsources. Any organization's greatest resource is the innovative capacity of\nits workforce. For that potential to be tapped, businesses must make sure they\ngive their employees chances to take on responsibility for the cups and the\nice -- and, when their work proves successful, allow them to do much more.\n\n  * ...\n\nshares\n\n  * _ _\n  * _ _\n  * _ _\n  * _ _\n  * [_ _](javascript:AWCow\\('https://www.strategy-business.com/share-email?url=www.strategy-business.com/blog/Career-management-lessons-from-Friends&ids=41717549-42129569','480','560','location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,titlebar=no,status=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes'\\))\n  *   * [_ _](javascript:window.print\\(\\))\n  * _ _\n\nTopics: [human capital](/tag?tag=human capital),\n[innovation](/tag?tag=innovation), [leadership](/tag?tag=leadership),\n[organizational behavior](/tag?tag=organizational behavior), [organization\nculture](/tag?tag=organization culture)\n\n**[Josh Levs](/author?author=Josh+Levs)**\n\n[![Josh\nLevs](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](/author?author=Josh+Levs)\n\n**[Josh Levs](https://joshlevs.com/)**  is a business consultant, former\njournalist for NPR and CNN, and the author of  _[All In: How Our Work-First\nCulture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses-- and How We Can Fix It\nTogether](https://joshlevs.com/all-in-book-by-josh-levs/)_.

John D. Rockefeller refined 90 percent of American oil,\nwhich supplied the pre-electric nation with light. Bill Gates created a\nprogram that was considered a prerequisite for turning on a computer.\n\n _To hear more feature stories,[see our full\nlist](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/audio-\narticles/?utm_source=audioarticleembed) or [get the Audm iPhone\napp.](https://www.audm.com/utm_source=soundcloud&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=atlantic&utm_content=bezos_master_plan)\n_\n\nAt 55, Bezos has never dominated a major market as thoroughly as any of these\nforebears, and while he is presently the richest man on the planet, he has\nless wealth than Gates did at his zenith. Yet Rockefeller largely contented\nhimself with oil wells, pump stations, and railcars; Gates\u2019s fortune depended\non an operating system. The scope of the empire the founder and CEO of Amazon\nhas built is wider. Indeed, it is without precedent in the long history of\nAmerican capitalism.\n\nToday, Bezos controls nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United\nStates. More product searches are conducted on Amazon than on Google, which\nhas allowed Bezos to build an advertising business as valuable as the entirety\nof IBM. One estimate has Amazon Web Services controlling almost half of the\ncloud-computing industry\u2014institutions as varied as General Electric, Unilever,\nand even the CIA rely on its servers. Forty-two percent of paper book sales\nand a third of the market for streaming video are controlled by the company;\nTwitch, its video platform popular among gamers, attracts 15 million users a\nday. Add _The Washington Post_ to this portfolio and Bezos is, at a minimum, a\nrival to the likes of Disney\u2019s Bob Iger or the suits at AT&T, and arguably the\nmost powerful man in American culture.\n\nI first grew concerned about Amazon\u2019s power five years ago. I felt anxious\nabout how the company bullied the book business, extracting ever more\nfavorable terms from the publishers that had come to depend on it. When the\nconglomerate Hachette, with which I\u2019d once published a book, refused to accede\nto Amazon\u2019s demands, it was punished. Amazon delayed shipments of Hachette\nbooks; when consumers searched for some Hachette titles, it redirected them to\nsimilar books from other publishers. In 2014, I wrote a cover story for _The\nNew Republic_ with a pugilistic title: \u201c[Amazon Must Be\nStopped](https://newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-\nbroken-radical-plan-tech-giant).\u201d Citing my article, the company subsequently\nterminated an advertising campaign for its political comedy, _Alpha House_ ,\nthat had been running in the magazine.\n\nSince that time, Bezos\u2019s reach has only grown. To the U.S. president, he is a\nnemesis. To many Americans, he is a beneficent wizard of convenience and\nabundance. Over the course of just this past year, Amazon has announced the\nfollowing endeavors: It will match potential home buyers with real-estate\nagents and integrate their new homes with Amazon devices; it will enable its\nvoice assistant, Alexa, to access health-care data, such as the status of a\nprescription or a blood-sugar reading; it will build a 3-million-square-foot\ncargo airport outside Cincinnati; it will make next-day delivery standard for\nmembers of its Prime service; it will start a new chain of grocery stores, in\naddition to Whole Foods, which it already owns; it will stream Major League\nBaseball games; it will launch more than 3,000 satellites into orbit to supply\nthe world with high-speed internet.\n\nBezos worries that in the coming generations the planet\u2019s growing energy\ndemands will outstrip its limited supply. \u201cWe have to go to space to save\nEarth,\u201d he says.\n\nBezos\u2019s ventures are by now so large and varied that it is difficult to truly\ncomprehend the nature of his empire, much less the end point of his ambitions.\nWhat exactly does Jeff Bezos want? Or, to put it slightly differently, what\ndoes he believe? Given his power over the world, these are not small\nquestions. Yet he largely keeps his intentions to himself; many longtime\ncolleagues can\u2019t recall him ever expressing a political opinion. To replay a\nloop of his interviews from Amazon\u2019s quarter century of existence is to listen\nto him retell the same unrevealing anecdotes over and over.\n\nTo better understand him, I spent five months speaking with current and former\nAmazon executives, as well as people at the company\u2019s rivals and scholarly\nobservers. Bezos himself declined to participate in this story, and current\nemployees would speak to me only off the record. Even former staffers largely\npreferred to remain anonymous, assuming that they might eventually wish to\nwork for a business somehow entwined with Bezos\u2019s sprawling concerns.\n\n[From November 2018: Alexa, should we trust\nyou?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/alexa-how-will-you-\nchange-us/570844/)\n\nIn the course of these conversations, my view of Bezos began to shift. Many of\nmy assumptions about the man melted away; admiration jostled with continued\nunease. And I was left with a new sense of his endgame.\n\nBezos loves the word _relentless_ \u2014it appears again and again in his closely\nread annual letters to shareholders\u2014and I had always assumed that his aim was\ndomination for its own sake. In an era that celebrates corporate gigantism, he\nseemed determined to be the biggest of them all. But to say that Bezos\u2019s\nultimate goal is dominion over the planet is to misunderstand him. His\nambitions are not bound by the gravitational pull of the Earth.\n\n **B** efore Bezos settled on Amazon.com, he toyed with naming his unlaunched\nstore MakeItSo.com. He entertained using the phrase because he couldn\u2019t\ncontain a long-standing enthusiasm. The rejected moniker was a favored\nutterance of a man Bezos idolizes: the captain of the starship USS\nEnterprise-D, Jean-Luc Picard.\n\nBezos is unabashed in his fanaticism for _Star Trek_ and its many spin-offs.\nHe has a holding company called Zefram, which honors the character who\ninvented warp drive. He persuaded the makers of the film _Star Trek Beyond_ to\ngive him a cameo as a Starfleet official. He named his dog Kamala, after a\nwoman who appears in an episode as Picard\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d but unattainable mate.\nAs time has passed, Bezos and Picard have physically converged. Like the\ninterstellar explorer, portrayed by Patrick Stewart, Bezos shaved the remnant\nstrands on his high-gloss pate and acquired a cast-iron physique. A friend\nonce said that Bezos adopted his strenuous fitness regimen in anticipation of\nthe day that he, too, would journey to the heavens.\n\nWhen reporters tracked down Bezos\u2019s high-school girlfriend, she said, \u201cThe\nreason he\u2019s earning so much money is to get to outer space.\u201d This assessment\nhardly required a leap of imagination. As the valedictorian of Miami Palmetto\nSenior High School\u2019s class of 1982, Bezos used his graduation speech to unfurl\nhis vision for humanity. He dreamed aloud of the day when millions of his\nfellow earthlings would relocate to colonies in space. A local newspaper\nreported that his intention was \u201cto get all people off the Earth and see it\nturned into a huge national park.\u201d\n\nMost mortals eventually jettison teenage dreams, but Bezos remains\npassionately committed to his, even as he has come to control more and more of\nthe here and now. Critics have chided him for philanthropic stinginess, at\nleast relative to his wealth, but the thing Bezos considers his primary\nhumanitarian contribution isn\u2019t properly charitable. It\u2019s a profit-seeking\ncompany called Blue Origin, dedicated to fulfilling the prophecy of his high-\nschool graduation speech. He funds that venture\u2014which builds rockets, rovers,\nand the infrastructure that permits voyage beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014by\nselling about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year. More than his ownership of\nhis behemoth company or of _The Washington Post_ \u2014and more than the $2 billion\nhe\u2019s pledged to nonprofits working on homelessness and education for low-\nincome Americans\u2014Bezos calls Blue Origin his \u201cmost important work.\u201d\n\nHe considers the work so important because the threat it aims to counter is so\ngrave. What worries Bezos is that in the coming generations the planet\u2019s\ngrowing energy demands will outstrip its limited supply. The danger, he says,\n\u201cis not necessarily extinction,\u201d but stasis: \u201cWe will have to stop growing,\nwhich I think is a very bad future.\u201d While others might fret that climate\nchange will soon make the planet uninhabitable, the billionaire wrings his\nhands over the prospects of diminished growth. But the scenario he describes\nis indeed grim. Without enough energy to go around, rationing and starvation\nwill ensue. Over the years, Bezos has made himself inaccessible to journalists\nasking questions about Amazon. But he shares his faith in space colonization\nwith a preacher\u2019s zeal: \u201cWe have to go to space to save Earth.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of this faith is a text Bezos read as a teen. In 1976, a\nPrinceton physicist named Gerard K. O\u2019Neill wrote a populist case for moving\ninto space called _The High Frontier_ , a book beloved by sci-fi geeks, NASA\nfunctionaries, and aging hippies. As a Princeton student, Bezos attended\nO\u2019Neill seminars and ran the campus chapter of Students for the Exploration\nand Development of Space. Through Blue Origin, Bezos is developing detailed\nplans for realizing O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision.\n\nThe professor imagined colonies housed in miles-long cylindrical tubes\nfloating between Earth and the moon. The tubes would sustain a simulacrum of\nlife back on the mother planet, with soil, oxygenated air, free-flying birds,\nand \u201cbeaches lapped by waves.\u201d When Bezos describes these colonies\u2014and\npresents artists\u2019 renderings of them\u2014he sounds almost rapturous. \u201cThis is Maui\non its best day, all year long. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.\u201d Since the\ncolonies would allow the human population to grow without any earthly\nconstraints, the species would flourish like never before: \u201cWe can have a\ntrillion humans in the solar system, which means we\u2019d have a thousand Mozarts\nand a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilization.\u201d\n\nBezos rallies the public with passionate peroration and convincing command of\ndetail. Yet a human hole remains in his presentation. Who will govern this new\nworld? Who will write its laws? Who will decide which earthlings are admitted\ninto the colonies? These questions aren\u2019t explicitly answered, except with his\nfervent belief that entrepreneurs, those in his own image, will shape the\nfuture. And he will do his best to make it so. With his wealth, and the\nmegaphone that it permits him, Bezos is attempting to set the terms for the\nfuture of the species, so that his utopia can take root.\n\n **I** n a way, Bezos has already created a prototype of a cylindrical tube\ninhabited by millions, and it\u2019s called Amazon.com. His creation is less a\ncompany than an encompassing system. If it were merely a store that sold\npractically all salable goods\u2014and delivered them within 48 hours\u2014it would\nstill be the most awe-inspiring creation in the history of American business.\nBut Amazon is both that tangible company and an abstraction far more powerful.\n\nBezos\u2019s enterprise upends long-held precepts about the fundamental nature of\ncapitalism\u2014especially an idea enshrined by the great Austrian economist\nFriedrich Hayek. As World War II drew to its close, Hayek wrote the essay \u201cThe\nUse of Knowledge in Society,\u201d a seminal indictment of centralized planning.\nHayek argued that no bureaucracy could ever match the miracle of markets,\nwhich spontaneously and efficiently aggregate the knowledge of a society. When\nmarkets collectively set a price, that price reflects the discrete bits of\nknowledge scattered among executives, workers, and consumers. Any governmental\nattempt to replace this organic apparatus\u2014to set prices unilaterally, or even\nto understand the disparate workings of an economy\u2014is pure hubris.\n\nIn contrast to the dysfunction and cynicism that define the times, Amazon is\nthe embodiment of competence, the rare institution that routinely works.\n\nAmazon, however, has acquired the God\u2019s-eye view of the economy that Hayek\nnever imagined any single entity could hope to achieve. At any moment, its\nwebsite has more than 600 million items for sale and more than 3 million\nvendors selling them. With its history of past purchases, it has collected the\nworld\u2019s most comprehensive catalog of consumer desire, which allows it to\nanticipate both individual and collective needs. With its logistics\nbusiness\u2014and its growing network of trucks and planes\u2014it has an understanding\nof the flow of goods around the world. In other words, if Marxist\nrevolutionaries ever seized power in the United States, they could nationalize\nAmazon and call it a day.\n\n[Read: Jeff Bezos\u2019s $150 billion fortune is a policy\nfailure](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/08/the-problem-\nwith-bezos-billions/566552/)\n\nWhat makes Amazon so fearsome to its critics isn\u2019t purely its size but its\ntrajectory. Amazon\u2019s cache of knowledge gives it the capacity to build its own\nwinning version of an astonishing array of businesses. In the face of its\ngrowth, long-dormant fears of monopoly have begun to surface\u2014and Amazon has\nreportedly found itself under review by the Federal Trade Commission and the\nDepartment of Justice. But unlike Facebook, another object of government\nscrutiny, Bezos\u2019s company remains deeply trusted by the public. A 2018 poll\nsponsored by Georgetown University and the Knight Foundation found that Amazon\nengendered greater confidence than virtually any other American institution.\nDespite Donald Trump\u2019s jabs at Bezos, this widespread faith in the company\nmakes for a source of bipartisan consensus, although the Democrats surveyed\nwere a touch more enthusiastic than the Republicans were: They rated Amazon\neven more trustworthy than the U.S. military. In contrast to the dysfunction\nand cynicism that define the times, Amazon is the embodiment of competence,\nthe rare institution that routinely works.\n\nAll of this confidence in Bezos\u2019s company has made him a singular figure in\nthe culture, which, at times, regards him as a flesh-and-blood Picard. If\n\u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d\u2014the motto of the Bezos-era _Washington Post_\n\u2014then he is the rescuer of the light, the hero who reversed the terminal\ndecline of Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s old broadsheet. When he wrote [a Medium\npost alleging that the _National Enquirer_ had attempted to extort\nhim](https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f),\nhe was hailed for taking a stand against tabloid sleaze and cyberbullying.\n\nAs Amazon has matured, it has assumed the trappings of something more than a\nprivate enterprise. It increasingly poses as a social institution tending to\nthe common good. After it earned derision for the alleged treatment of its\nworkers\u2014some warehouse employees reported feeling pressured to forgo bathroom\nbreaks to meet productivity targets, to cite just one example\u2014it unilaterally\nraised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in the U.S., then attempted to shame\ncompetitors that didn\u2019t follow suit. (Amazon says that employees are allowed\nto use the bathroom whenever they want.) As technology has reshaped its\nworkforce, Amazon has set aside $700 million to retrain about a third of its\nU.S. employees for roles with new demands.\n\nThese gestures are partly gambits to insulate the company\u2019s reputation from\naccusations of rapaciousness. But they also tie Amazon to an older conception\nof the corporation. In its current form, Amazon harkens back to Big Business\nas it emerged in the postwar years. When Charles E. Wilson, the president of\nGeneral Motors, was nominated to be secretary of defense in 1953, he famously\ntold a Senate confirmation panel, \u201cI thought what was good for our country was\ngood for General Motors, and vice versa.\u201d For the most part, this was an\naphorism earnestly accepted as a statement of good faith. To avert class\nwarfare, the Goliaths of the day recognized unions; they bestowed health care\nand pensions upon employees. Liberal eminences such as John K. Galbraith\nhailed the corporation as the basis for a benign social order. Galbraith\nextolled the social utility of the corporation because he believed that it\ncould be domesticated and harnessed to serve interests other than its own\nbottom line. He believed businesses behave beneficently when their self-\nserving impulses are checked by \u201ccountervailing power\u201d in the form of\norganized labor and government.\n\nOf course, those powers have receded. Unions, whose organizing efforts Amazon\nhas routinely squashed, are an unassuming nub of their former selves; the\nregulatory state is badly out of practice. So while Amazon is trusted, no\ncountervailing force has the inclination or capacity to restrain it. And while\npower could amass in a more villainous character than Jeff Bezos, that doesn\u2019t\nalleviate the anxiety that accompanies such concentration. Amazon might be a\nvast corporation, with more than 600,000 employees, but it is also the\nextension of one brilliant, willful man with an incredible knack for bending\nthe world to his values.\n\n## 2.0\n\nAfter Jackie Bezos\u2019s shotgun marriage to a member of a traveling unicyclist\ntroupe dissolved, she dedicated herself to their only progeny. The teenage\nmother from Albuquerque became her son\u2019s intellectual champion. She would\ndrive him 40 miles each day so that he could attend an elementary school for\nhigh-testing kids in Houston. When a wait list prevented him from entering the\ngifted track in middle school, she wheedled bureaucrats until they made an\nexception. Over the course of Bezos\u2019s itinerant childhood, as his family\ntraversed the Sun Belt of the \u201970s, Jackie encouraged her son\u2019s interest in\ntinkering by constantly shuttling him to RadioShack.\n\n\u201cI have always been academically smart,\u201d Bezos told an audience in Washington,\nD.C., last year. This was a sentiment ratified by the world as he ascended the\nmeritocracy. At Princeton, he flirted with becoming a theoretical physicist.\nOn Wall Street, he joined D. E. Shaw, arguably the brainiest and most\nadventurous hedge fund of the \u201990s. The firm would send unsolicited letters to\ndean\u2019s-list students at top universities, telling them: \u201cWe approach our\nrecruiting in unapologetically elitist fashion.\u201d\n\nThe computer scientist who founded the firm, David E. Shaw, had dabbled in the\nnascent internet in the \u201980s. This provided him with unusual clarity about the\ncoming revolution and its commercial implications. He anointed Bezos to seek\nout investment opportunities in the newly privatized medium\u2014an exploration\nthat led Bezos to his own big idea.\n\nWhen Bezos created Amazon in 1994, he set out to build an institution like the\nones that had carried him through the first three decades of his life. He\nwould build his own aristocracy of brains, a place where intelligence would\nrise to the top. Early on, Bezos asked job candidates for their SAT scores.\nThe company\u2019s fifth employee, Nicholas Lovejoy, later told _Wired_ that\ninterviews would take the form of a Socratic test. Bezos would probe logical\nacuity with questions like _Why are manhole covers round?_ According to\nLovejoy, \u201cOne of his mottos was that every time we hired someone, he or she\nshould raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool was\nalways improving.\u201d When Bezos thought about talent, in other words, he was\nself-consciously in a Darwinian mode.\n\n[Read: The world wants less tech. Amazon gives it\nmore](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/amazon-doubles-\ndown-new-alexa-products-echo-loop/598906/)\n\nBy the logic of natural selection, it was hardly obvious that a bookstore\nwould become the dominant firm in the digital economy. From Amazon\u2019s infancy,\nBezos mastered the art of coyly deflecting questions about where he intended\nto take his company. But back in his hedge-fund days, he had kicked around the\nidea of an \u201ceverything store\u201d with Shaw. And he always conveyed the impression\nof having grand plans\u2014a belief that the fiction aisle and the self-help\nsection might serve as the trailhead to commanding heights.\n\nIn the vernacular, Amazon is often lumped together with Silicon Valley. At its\nspiritual center, however, Amazon is a retailer, not a tech company. Amazon\nneeded to elbow its way into a tightly packed and unforgiving industry, where\nit faced entrenched entities such as Barnes & Noble, Walmart, and Target. In\nmass-market retail, the company with the thinnest margin usually prevails, and\na soft December can ruin a year. Even as Bezos prided himself on his capacity\nfor thinking far into the future, he also had to worry about the prospect of\ntomorrow\u2019s collapse. At tightfisted Amazon, there were no big bonuses at\nyear\u2019s end, no business-class flights for executives on long hauls, no\nemployee kitchens overflowing with protein bars.\n\nBezos was hardly a mellow leader, especially in the company\u2019s early days. To\nmold his organization in his image, he often lashed out at those who failed to\nmeet his high standards. The journalist Brad Stone\u2019s indispensable book about\nthe company, _The Everything Store_ , contains a list of Bezos\u2019s cutting\nremarks: \u201cAre you lazy or just incompetent?\u201d \u201cThis document was clearly\nwritten by the B team. Can someone get me the A-team document?\u201d \u201cWhy are you\nruining my life?\u201d (Amazon says this account is not reflective of Bezos\u2019s\nleadership style.) This was the sarcastic, demeaning version of his endless\nquestioning. But Bezos\u2019s waspish intelligence and attention to detail\u2014his\ninvariable focus on a footnote or an appendix\u2014elicited admiration alongside\nthe dread. \u201cIf you\u2019re going in for a Bezos meeting, you\u2019re preparing as if the\nworld is going to end,\u201d a former executive told me. \u201cYou\u2019re like, _I\u2019ve been\npreparing for the last three weeks. I\u2019ve asked every damn person that I know\nto think of questions that could be asked._ Then Bezos will ask you the one\nquestion you hadn\u2019t considered.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the company\u2014which already brought in nearly $3 billion in\nrevenue in its seventh year of existence\u2014prodded Bezos to adapt his methods.\nHe created a new position, technical adviser, to instill his views in top\nmanagers; the technical advisers would shadow the master for at least a year,\nand emerge as what executives jokingly refer to as \u201cJeff-bots.\u201d His managerial\nstyle, which had been highly personal, was codified in systems and procedures.\nThese allowed him to scale his presence so that even if he wasn\u2019t sitting in a\nmeeting, his gestalt would be there.\n\nIn 2002, Amazon distilled Bezos\u2019s sensibility into a set of [Leadership\nPrinciples](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles), a collection of maxims\nincluding \u201cInvent and Simplify,\u201d \u201cBias for Action,\u201d and \u201cHave Backbone;\nDisagree and Commit.\u201d To an outside ear, these sound too hokey to be the basis\nfor fervent belief. But Amazonians, as employees call themselves, swear by\nthem. The principles, now 14 in number, are the subject of questions asked in\njob interviews; they are taught in orientations; they are the qualities on\nwhich employees are judged in performance reviews.\n\nJeff Bezos in Seattle in 1998. It was hardly obvious that a bookstore would\nbecome the dominant firm in the digital economy, but Bezos always believed\nthat the fiction aisle might serve as the trailhead to commanding heights.\n(Rex Rystedt / Life Images Collection / Getty)\n\nOf all the principles, perhaps the most sacrosanct is \u201cCustomer Obsession\u201d\u2014the\ncommandment to make decisions only with an eye toward pleasing the consumer,\nrather than fixating on competitors\u2014a pillar of faith illustrated by the Great\nLube Scandal. About 10 years ago, Bezos became aware that Amazon was sending\nemails to customers suggesting the purchase of lubricants. This fact made him\napoplectic. If such an email arrived at work, a boss might glimpse it. If it\narrived at home, a child might pose uncomfortable questions. Bezos ordered the\nproblem solved and threatened to shut down Amazon\u2019s email promotions in their\nentirety if it wasn\u2019t. Kristi Coulter, who served as the head of worldwide\neditorial and site merchandising, led a group that spent weeks compiling a\nlist of verboten products, which Bezos\u2019s top deputies then reviewed. She told\nme, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just, like, hemorrhoid cream, or lube, it was hair color, any\nkind of retinol. They were so conservative about what they thought would be\nembarrassing. Even tooth-whitening stuff, they were like, \u2018No. That could be\nembarrassing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTo climb Amazon\u2019s organizational chart is to aspire to join the inner sanctum\nat the very peak, called the S-Team (\u201cthe senior team\u201d). These are the 17\nexecutives who assemble regularly with Bezos to debate the company\u2019s\nweightiest decisions. Bezos treats the S-Team with familial affection; its\nmembers come closest to being able to read his mind. The group has absorbed\nthe Bezos method and applies it to the corners of the company that he can\u2019t\npossibly touch. According to James Thomson, a manager who helped build Amazon\nMarketplace, where anyone can sell new or used goods through the website, \u201cAt\nmost companies, executives like to show how much they know. At Amazon, the\nfocus is on asking the right question. Leadership is trained to poke holes in\ndata.\u201d\n\nOnce an executive makes it to the S-Team, he remains on the S-Team. The\nstability of the unit undoubtedly provides Bezos a measure of comfort, but it\nalso calcifies this uppermost echelon in an antiquated vision of diversity.\nThe S\u2011Team has no African Americans; the only woman runs human resources. Nor\ndoes the composition of leadership change much a step down the ladder. When\nCNBC examined the 48 executives who run Amazon\u2019s core businesses (including\nretail, cloud, and hardware), it found only four women.\n\nOne former team leader, who is a person of color, told me that when top\nexecutives hear the word _diversity_ , they interpret it to mean \u201cthe lowering\nof standards.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s this classic libertarian thinking,\u201d Coulter told me.\n\u201cThey think Amazon is a meritocracy based on data, but who\u2019s deciding what\ngets counted and who gets to avail themselves of the opportunity? If VP\nmeetings are scheduled at 7 a.m., how many mothers can manage that?\u201d\n\n(Amazon disputes the methodology CNBC used to tally women in its senior\nleadership ranks. \u201cThere are dozens of female executives that play a critical\nrole in Amazon\u2019s success,\u201d a spokesman told me in an email. He cited the\ncompany\u2019s generous parental-leave policy, a commitment to flexible scheduling,\nand the fact that more than 40 percent of its global workforce is female as\nevidence of its pursuit of gender equity. He also said that its Leadership\nPrinciples insist that employees \u201cseek diverse perspectives.\u201d)\n\nThe meritocrat\u2019s blind spot is that he considers his place in the world well\nearned by dint of intelligence and hard work. This belief short-circuits his\ncapacity to truly listen to critics. When confronted about the composition of\nthe S-Team in a company-wide meeting two years ago, Bezos seemed to dismiss\nthe urgency of the complaint. According to CNBC, he said that he expected \u201cany\ntransition there to happen very incrementally over a long period of time.\u201d\nThe[ latest addition to the group](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/who-are-\namazons-top-executives-2019.html), made this year, was another white male.\n\n **B** ezos built his organization to be an anti-bureaucracy. To counter the\ntendency of groups to bloat, he instituted something called \u201ctwo-pizza teams.\u201d\n(Like Bezos\u2019s other managerial innovations, this sounds like a gimmick, except\nthat advanced engineers and economists with doctorates accept it as the\norganizing principle of their professional lives.) According to the theory,\nteams at Amazon should ideally be small enough to be fed with two pizzas.\n\nIn its warehouses, Amazon has used video games to motivate workers\u2014the games,\nwith names like MissionRacer, track output and pit workers against one\nanother, prodding them to move faster. The two-pizza teams represent a more\nsubtle, white-collar version of this gamification. The small teams instill a\nsense of ownership over projects. But employees placed on such small teams can\nalso experience a greater fear of failure, because there\u2019s no larger group in\nwhich to hide or to more widely distribute blame.\n\nAmazon has a raft of procedures to guide its disparate teams. Bezos insists\nthat plans be pitched in six-page memos, written in full sentences, a form he\ndescribes as \u201cnarrative.\u201d This practice emerged from a sense that PowerPoint\nhad become a tool for disguising fuzzy thinking. Writing, Bezos surmised,\ndemands a more linear type of reasoning. As John Rossman, an alumnus of the\ncompany who wrote a book called _Think Like Amazon_ , described it, \u201cIf you\ncan\u2019t write it out, then you\u2019re not ready to defend it.\u201d The six-pagers are\nconsumed at the beginning of meetings in what Bezos has called a \u201cstudy hall\u201d\natmosphere. This ensures that the audience isn\u2019t faking its way through the\nmeeting either. Only after the silent digestion of the memo\u2014which can be an\nanxiety-inducing stretch for its authors\u2014can the group ask questions about the\ndocument.\n\nTaylor Hill / Getty\n\nMost teams at Amazon are hermetic entities; required expertise is embedded in\neach group. Take Amazon\u2019s robust collection of economists with doctorates. In\nthe past several years, the company has hired more than 150 of them, which\nmakes Amazon a far larger employer of economists than any university in the\ncountry. Tech companies such as Microsoft and Uber have also hired economists,\nalthough not as many. And while other companies have tended to keep them in\ncentralized units, often working on forecasting or policy issues, Amazon takes\na different approach. It distributes economists across a range of teams, where\nthey can, among other things, run controlled experiments that permit\nscientific, and therefore effective, manipulation of consumer behavior.\n\n _Relentless_ might be the most Amazonian word, but Bezos also talks about the\nvirtues of wandering. \u201cWandering is an essential counterbalance to\nefficiency,\u201d he wrote in a letter to shareholders this year. When I spoke with\nworkers based at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, they said what they\nappreciated most about their employer was the sense of intellectual autonomy\nit allowed. Once they had clearly articulated a mission in an approved six-\npager, they typically had wide latitude to make it happen, without having to\nfight through multiple layers of approval. The wandering mentality has also\nhelped Amazon continually expand into adjacent businesses\u2014or businesses that\nseem, at first, unrelated. Assisted by the ever growing consumer and supplier\ndata it collects, and the insights into human needs and human behavior it is\nconstantly uncovering, the company keeps finding new opportunities for growth.\n\n[Read: When Amazon went from big to unbelievably\nbig](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/when-amazon-went-\nfrom-big-to-unbelievably-big/582097/)\n\nWhat is Amazon, aside from a listing on Nasdaq? This is a flummoxing question.\nThe company is named for the world\u2019s most voluminous river, but it also has\ntributaries shooting out in all directions. _Retailer_ hardly captures the\ncompany now that it\u2019s also a movie studio, an artificial-intelligence\ndeveloper, a device manufacturer, and a web-services provider. But to describe\nit as a conglomerate isn\u2019t quite right either, given that so many of its\nbusinesses are tightly integrated or eventually will be. When I posed the\nquestion to Amazonians, I got the sense that they considered the company to be\na paradigm\u2014a distinctive approach to making decisions, a set of values, the\nJeff Bezos view of the world extended through some 600,000 employees. This\ndescription, of course, means that the company\u2019s expansion has no natural\nboundary; no sector of the economy inherently lies beyond its core\ncompetencies.\n\n## 3.0\n\nIn late 2012, Donald Graham prepared to sell his inheritance, _The Washington\nPost_. He wanted to hand the paper over to someone with pockets deep enough to\nhold steady through the next recession; he wanted someone techie enough to\ncomplete the paper\u2019s digital transition; above all, he wanted someone who\ngrasped the deeper meaning of stewardship. Graham came up with a shortlist of\nideal owners he would pursue, including the financier David M. Rubenstein,\nformer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and\nBezos.\n\nThe last of the names especially enticed Graham. That January, he had\nbreakfast with his friend and adviser Warren Buffett, who also happened to be\na shareholder in the _Post_. Buffett mentioned that he considered Bezos the\n\u201cbest CEO in the United States\u201d\u2014hardly an unconventional opinion, but Graham\nhad never heard it from Buffett before. After the breakfast, Graham set out to\nbetter understand Bezos\u2019s ideological predilections. \u201cI did a primitive Google\nsearch and found nothing, as close to nothing for somebody with that kind of\nwealth. I didn\u2019t know what his politics were,\u201d he told me. This blankness\nsuggested to Graham the stuff of an ideal newspaper owner.\n\nGraham dispatched an emissary to make the pitch. It was a polite but hardly\npromising conversation: Bezos didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of bidding for\nthe _Post_ , but he didn\u2019t display any palpable enthusiasm, either. The fact\nthat he dropped the subject for several months seemed the best gauge of his\ninterest. While Bezos ghosted Graham, Omidyar, the most enthusiastic of the\nbidders, continued to seek the prize.\n\nBezos\u2019s past pronouncements may not have revealed partisanship, but they did\nsuggest little appetite for stodgy institutionalism. Like so many CEOs of the\nera, Bezos figured himself an instrument of creative destruction, with little\nsympathy for the destroyed. \u201cEven well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,\u201d\nhe wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders. He was critiquing New York book\npublishers, whose power Amazon had aimed to diminish. But he harbored a\nsimilarly dim view of self-satisfied old-media institutions that attempted to\npreserve their cultural authority.\n\nIt therefore came as a surprise when, after months of silence, Bezos sent a\nthree-sentence email expressing interest in the _Post_. Graham made plans to\nlunch with Bezos in Sun Valley, Idaho, where they would both be attending\nAllen & Company\u2019s summer conference. Over sandwiches that Graham brought back\nto his rental, the old proprietor made his preferred buyer a counterintuitive\npitch: He explained all the reasons owning a newspaper was hard. He wanted\nBezos to know that a newspaper was a self-defeating vehicle for promoting\nbusiness interests or any preferred agenda. The conversation was a tutorial in\nthe responsibilities of the elite, from a distinguished practitioner.\n\nGraham didn\u2019t need to plead with Bezos. In Sun Valley, they hardly haggled\nover terms. \u201cWe had brunch twice, and at the end we shook hands, unlike almost\nany deal I\u2019ve ever made in business,\u201d Graham told me. The man who decried\ngatekeepers was suddenly the keeper of one of the nation\u2019s most important\ngates.\n\nBuying the _Post_ was not a financially momentous event in the life of Jeff\nBezos. In addition to the billions in Amazon stock he owned, he had quietly\ninvested in Google and Uber in their infancy. The Bezos imprimatur, the young\ncompanies had understood, would burnish their chances with any other would-be\ninvestor. (Uber\u2019s initial public offering alone earned him an estimated $400\nmillion earlier this year, far more than he paid for the _Post_ in 2013.)\n\nBut the purchase _was_ a turning point in Bezos\u2019s reputational history\u2014and\nrealigned his sense of place in the world. On the eve of the acquisition,\nAmazon\u2019s relationship with New York publishing was contentious. The friendly\nguy who professed his love of Kazuo Ishiguro novels and had created a cool new\nway to buy books was now seen in some quarters as an enemy of literary culture\nand a successor to the monopolist Rockefeller. Not long before the\nacquisition, he had written a memo, obtained by Brad Stone, titled\n\u201cAmazon.love,\u201d asking the S-Team to ponder how the company could avoid\nbecoming as feared as Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. Although he never\njustified the purchase of the _Post_ as a response to his anxieties about\nAmazon\u2019s image\u2014and, of course, his own\u2014the question must have been on his mind\nas he considered the opportunity. To save a civically minded institution like\nthe _Post_ was a chance to stake a different legacy for himself.\n\n[Read: I delivered packages for Amazon and it was a\nnightmare](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/amazon-flex-\nworkers/563444/)\n\nBezos keeps the _Post_ structurally separate from Amazon\u2014his family office\nmonitors the business of the paper\u2014but he runs it in the same expansionist\nspirit as he does his company. He vowed to put every dollar of profit back\ninto the enterprise. In the six years of his ownership, the _Post_ newsroom\nhas grown from 500 to just over 850.\n\nDespite his investments in the institution, Bezos\u2019s transition to Washington,\nD.C., was halting and awkward. It took him several months to visit the _Post_\nnewsroom and try to allay rank-and-file nervousness about the intentions of\nthe new owner. When the _Post_ \u2019s great editor Ben Bradlee died several months\ninto his regime, he decided to attend the funeral only after Bob Woodward\nexplained its spiritual significance. His attachment to the paper didn\u2019t seem\nto acquire emotional depth until he sent his jet to retrieve the reporter\nJason Rezaian from Iran, where he\u2019d been imprisoned for 18 months, and\npersonally accompanied him home. The press hailed Bezos for displaying such a\nstrong interest in the fate of his reporter, a taste of how media extol those\nthey regard as their own saviors.\n\nIt may have taken him a moment to realize that Washington would be a new\ncenter of his life, but once he did, he rushed to implant himself there. In\n2016, he paid $23 million to buy the site of a former museum just down the\nblock from Woodrow Wilson\u2019s old home. The museum had joined together two\nmansions, one of which had been designed by John Russell Pope, the architect\nof the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. Bezos kept one of the buildings as his\nresidential quarters and set about renovating the other for the sake of\nsocializing, a space that seemed to self-consciously recall Katharine Graham\u2019s\nold salon, except with geothermal heat. _Washingtonian_ magazine, which\nobtained Bezos\u2019s blueprints, predicted that, once complete, it will become \u201ca\nveritable Death Star of Washington entertaining.\u201d\n\n **W** hile Bezos made himself at home in Washington, so did his company, but\non its own terms. The Obama years were a boom time for Big Tech. Executives\nregularly shuffled through the White House. Visitor logs record that no\nAmerican company visited more often than Google. Silicon Valley hurled itself\ninto policy debates with its characteristic pretense of idealism, even as it\nbegan to hire Brioni-clad influence peddlers. It was, by its own account,\nbattling for nothing less than the future of the free internet, a fight to\npreserve net neutrality and prevent greedy telecoms from choking the\nliberatory promise of the new medium.\n\nAs the tech companies invested heavily in policy, Amazon would occasionally\ncheer them on and join their coalitions. But mostly it struck a pose of\nindifference. Amazon didn\u2019t spend as much on lobbyists as most of its Big Tech\nbrethren did, at least not until the late Obama years. Amazon seemed less\nconcerned about setting policy than securing lucrative contracts. It\napproached government as another customer to be obsessed over.\n\nGiven the way Democrats now bludgeon Big Tech, it\u2019s hard to remember how\nwarmly Barack Obama embraced the industry, and how kindly Big Tech\nreciprocated with campaign donations. But there was a less visible reason for\nthe alliance: As the debacle of healthcare.gov graphically illustrated, Obama\nbadly needed a geek squad. He installed the nation\u2019s first-ever chief\ntechnology officer, and the administration began to importune the federal\nbureaucracy to upload itself to the cloud, a move it promised would save money\nand more effectively secure sensitive material.\n\nBezos visits the _Washington Post_ newsroom in 2016. The purchase of the paper\nwas a turning point in his reputational history, a chance to stake a legacy\nfor himself as a defender of a civically minded institution. (Bill O\u2019Leary /\n_The Washington Post_ / Getty)\n\nCloud First was the official name of the policy. Amazon had nothing to do with\nits inception, but it stood to make billions from it. It had wandered into the\ncloud-computing business long before its rivals. Amazon Web Services is, at\nits most elemental, a constellation of server farms around the world, which it\nrents at low cost as highly secure receptacles for data. Apple, the messaging\nplatform Slack, and scores of start-ups all reside on AWS.\n\nIf retail was a maddeningly low-margin business, AWS was closer to pure\nprofit. And Amazon had the field to itself. \u201cWe faced no like-minded\ncompetition for seven years. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Bezos boasted last year. AWS\nis such a dominant player that even Amazon\u2019s competitors, including Netflix,\nhouse data with it\u2014although Walmart resolutely refuses, citing anxieties about\nplacing its precious secrets on its competitor\u2019s servers. Walmart is more\nsuspicious than the intelligence community: In 2013, the CIA agreed to spend\n$600 million to place its data in Amazon\u2019s cloud.\n\nAmazon has grown enormous, in part, by shirking tax responsibility. The\ngovernment rewards this failure with massive contracts, which will make the\ncompany even bigger.\n\nOther Big Tech companies have fretted about the morality of becoming entangled\nwith the national-security state. But Bezos has never expressed such\nreservations. His grandfather developed missile-defense systems for the\nPentagon and supervised nuclear labs. Bezos grew up steeped in the romance of\nthe Space Age, a time when Big Business and Big Government linked arms to\nachieve great national goals. Besides, to be trusted with the secrets of\nAmerica\u2019s most secretive agency gave Amazon a talking point that it could take\ninto any sales pitch\u2014the credentials that would recommend it to any other\ngovernment buyer.\n\nOne of Amazon\u2019s great strengths is its capacity to learn, and it eventually\nacclimated itself to the older byways of Washington clientelism, adding three\nformer congressmen to its roster of lobbyists. (Amazon\u2019s spending on lobbying\nhas increased by almost 470 percent since 2012.) It also began to hire\nofficials as they stepped out of their agencies. When the Obama\nadministration\u2019s top procurement officer, Anne Rung, left her post, she headed\nstraight to Amazon.\n\nThe goal wasn\u2019t just to win cloud-computing contracts. Amazon sold facial-\nrecognition software to law-enforcement agencies and has reportedly pitched it\nto Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Amazon also wanted to become the\nportal through which government bureaus buy staples, chairs, coffee beans, and\nelectronic devices. This wasn\u2019t a trivial slice of business; the U.S.\ngovernment spends more than $50 billion on consumer goods each year. In 2017,\nthe House of Representatives quietly passed the so-called Amazon amendment,\nburied within a larger appropriations bill. The provisions claimed to\nmodernize government procurement, but also seemed to set the terms for\nAmazon\u2019s dominance of this business. Only after competitors grasped the\nsignificance of the amendment did a backlash slow the rush toward Amazon. (The\ngovernment is preparing to run a pilot program testing a few different\nvendors.)\n\nStill, government\u2019s trajectory was easy to see, especially if one looked\noutside the capital city. In 2017, Amazon signed an agreement with a little-\nknown organization called U.S. Communities, with the potential to yield an\nestimated $5.5 billion. U.S. Communities negotiates on behalf of more than\n55,000 county and municipal entities (school districts, library systems,\npolice departments) to buy chalk, electronics, books, and the like. A 2018\nreport by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance documented how a growing share\nof the physical items that populate public spaces has come to be supplied by\nAmazon.\n\nAt the heart of Amazon\u2019s growing relationship with government is a choking\nirony. Last year, Amazon didn\u2019t pay a cent of federal tax. The company has\nmastered the art of avoidance, by exploiting foreign tax havens and\nmoonwalking through the seemingly infinite loopholes that accountants dream\nup. Amazon may not contribute to the national coffers, but public funds pour\ninto its own bank accounts. Amazon has grown enormous, in part, by shirking\ntax responsibility. The government rewards this failure with massive\ncontracts, which will make the company even bigger.\n\n **W** hat type of ego does Jeff Bezos possess? The president of the United\nStates has tested his capacity for sublimation by pummeling him mercilessly.\nIn Trump\u2019s populist morality play, \u201cJeff Bozo\u201d is cast as an overlord. He\ncrushes small businesses; he rips off the postal service; he stealthily\nadvances corporate goals through his newspaper, which Trump misleadingly\nrefers to as the \u201cAmazon _Washington Post_.\u201d During the 2016 campaign, Trump\nvowed to use the machinery of state to flay Amazon: \u201cIf I become president, oh\ndo they have problems.\u201d Don Graham\u2019s warnings about the downsides of newspaper\nownership suddenly looked prophetic.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Bezos has always whistled past these attacks: In a countertweet,\nhe once joked about launching Donald Trump into space. However, the nature of\nBezos\u2019s business, with both government and red-state consumers, means that he\nwould rather avoid presidential hostility.\n\nDespite the vitriol, or perhaps because of it, Amazon hired the lobbyist Jeff\nMiller, a prodigious Trump fundraiser; Bezos conveys his opinions to the\npresident\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In 2017, Bezos won a nomination to join\na panel advising the Defense Department on technology, although the swearing-\nin was canceled after Pentagon officials realized that he had not undergone a\nbackground check. (He never joined the panel.) One former White House aide\ntold me, \u201cIf Trump knew how much communication Bezos has had with officials in\nthe West Wing, he would lose his mind.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2017, the Pentagon announced a project called the Joint\nEnterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The project would migrate the\nDefense Department\u2019s data to a centralized cloud, so that the agency could\nmake better use of artificial intelligence and more easily communicate across\ndistant battlefields. The Pentagon signaled the importance of the venture with\nthe amount it intended to spend on it: $10 billion over 10 years. But it has\nthe potential to be even more lucrative, since the rest of the federal\ngovernment tends to follow the Pentagon\u2019s technological lead.\n\nFirms vied ferociously to win the contract. Because Amazon was widely seen as\nthe front-runner, it found itself on the receiving end of most of the slings.\nIts rivals attempted to stoke Trump\u2019s disdain for Bezos. An executive at the\ntechnology company Oracle created a flowchart purporting to illustrate\nAmazon\u2019s efforts, titled \u201c[A Conspiracy to Create a Ten Year DoD Cloud\nMonopoly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/30/pentagon-issues-\nforceful-rebuke-oracle-debate-over-massive-federal-contract-turns-caustic/).\u201d\nOracle has denied slipping the graphic to the president, but a copy landed in\nTrump\u2019s hands.\n\nBezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie, attend the 2017 _Vanity Fair_ Oscars\nparty. Bezos has immersed himself in Hollywood culture. (Mike Coppola / VF17 /\nGetty)\n\nOracle also tried to block Amazon in court. Its filings spun a sinister\nnarrative of Amazon infiltrating the Pentagon. A former consultant for Amazon\nWeb Services had landed a top job in the secretary of defense\u2019s office, but at\nthe heart of Oracle\u2019s tale was a project manager who had arrived at the\nPentagon by way of Amazon named Deap Ubhi. Even as he worked in government,\nUbhi tweeted: \u201cOnce an Amazonian, always an Amazonian.\u201d Oracle alleged that he\nstayed true to that self-description as he helped shape JEDI to favor his alma\nmater. (Amazon countered that dozens of people developed the contract, and\nthat Ubhi worked on JEDI for only seven weeks, in its early stages.) When the\nPentagon formally announced JEDI\u2019s specifications, only Amazon and Microsoft\nmet them.\n\nUbhi\u2019s role in the project was concerning, but not enough for either a federal\njudge or the Pentagon to halt JEDI. There was \u201csmoke,\u201d the judge said, but no\n\u201cfire.\u201d This victory should have paved the way for Amazon. But with the\nPentagon nearly set to award JEDI this summer, the president\u2019s new secretary\nof defense, Mark Esper, announced that he was delaying the decision and\nreexamining the contract. A Pentagon official told me that Trump had seen\nTucker Carlson inveigh against JEDI on Fox News and asked for an explanation.\nSenator Marco Rubio, who received more than $5 million in campaign\ncontributions from Oracle during the 2016 campaign cycle, called for the\nPentagon to delay awarding the bid, and reportedly pressed the case in a phone\ncall with Trump. (Rubio received a much smaller donation from Amazon in the\nsame period.) Trump seems to have been unable to resist a chance to stick it\nto his enemy, perhaps mortally imperiling Amazon\u2019s chance to add $10 billion\nto its bottom line.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s motives, it\u2019s hard not to sympathize with Bezos. But Trump\u2019s\nspite\u2014and the terrible precedent set by his punishment of a newspaper\nowner\u2014doesn\u2019t invalidate the questions asked of Amazon. Its critics have\nargued that government shouldn\u2019t latch itself onto a single company,\nespecially not with a project this important. They noted that storing all of\nthe Pentagon\u2019s secrets with one provider could make them more vulnerable to\nbad actors. It could also create an unhealthy dependence on a firm that might\ngrow complacent with its assured stream of revenue and lose its innovative\nedge over time.\n\nJEDI sits within the context of larger questions about the government\u2019s\nrelationship to Amazon. Fears that the public was underwriting the company\u2019s\ncontinued growth haunted Amazon\u2019s attempt to build a second headquarters in\nQueens\u2014New York government looked like it was providing tax breaks and\nsubsidies to the business that least needs a boost.\n\nWhile Amazon\u2019s aborted move to Long Island City attracted all the attention,\nthe building of a similar bastion just outside Washington, D.C., is more\nominous. Of course, there are plenty of honorable reasons for a company to set\nup shop in the prosperous shadow of the Capitol. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that\nAmazon wasn\u2019t also thinking about its budding business with the government\u2014an\nopportunity that the delay of JEDI will hardly dissuade it from pursuing.\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office survey of 16 agencies, only 11\npercent of the federal government has made the transition to the cloud.\n\nThe company is following in its owner\u2019s tracks. Just as Bezos has folded\nhimself into the fraternity of Washington power\u2014yukking it up at the Alfalfa\nand Gridiron Clubs\u2014thousands of Amazon implants will be absorbed by\nWashington. Executives will send their kids to the same fancy schools as\njournalists, think-tank fellows, and high-ranking government officials.\nAmazonians will accept dinner-party invites from new neighbors. The\nestablishment, plenty capacious, will assimilate millionaire migrants from the\nother Washington. Amazon\u2019s market power will be matched by political power;\nthe interests of the state and the interests of one enormous corporation will\nfurther jumble\u2014the sort of combination that has, in the past, never worked out\nwell for democracy.\n\n## 4.0\n\nJeff Bezos was with his people, the feted guest at the 2018 meeting of the\nNational Space Society. The group awarded him a prize it could be sure he\nwould appreciate: the Gerard K. O\u2019Neill Memorial Award for Space Settlement\nAdvocacy. After a dinner in his honor, Bezos sat onstage to chat with an\neditor from _GeekWire_. But before the discussion could begin, Bezos\ninterjected a question: \u201cDoes anybody here in this audience watch a TV show\ncalled _The Expanse_?\u201d\n\nThe question pandered to the crowd, eliciting applause, hoots, and whistles.\n_The Expanse_ , which had been broadcast on the Syfy channel, is about the\nexistential struggles of a space colony, set in the far future, based on\nnovels that Bezos adores. Despite the militancy of its devoted fans, Syfy had\ncanceled _The Expanse_. Angry protests had ensued. A plane had flown over an\nAmazon office in Santa Monica, California, with a banner urging the company to\npick up the show.\n\nBezos has justified Amazon\u2019s investment in Hollywood with a quip: \u201cWhen we win\na Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.\u201d\n\nAs the Space Society\u2019s exuberant reaction to Bezos\u2019s first question began to\nwane, Bezos juiced the crowd with another: \u201cDo you guys know that the cast of\n_The Expanse_ is here in the room?\u201d He asked the actors to stand. From his\nyears overseeing a movie studio, Bezos has come to understand the dramatic\nvalue of pausing for a beat. \u201cTen minutes ago,\u201d he told the room, \u201cI just got\nword that _The Expanse_ is saved.\u201d And, in fact, he was its benefactor.\nInvoking the name of the spaceship at the center of the series, he allowed\nhimself to savor the fist-pumping euphoria that surrounded him. \u201cThe Rocinante\nis safe.\u201d\n\n _The Expanse_ was one small addition to Bezos\u2019s Hollywood empire, which will\nsoon be housed in the old Culver Studios, where Hitchcock once filmed\n_Rebecca_ and Scorsese shot _Raging Bull_. Amazon will spend an estimated $5\nbillion to $6 billion on TV shows and movies this year.\n\nWhen Bezos first announced Amazon\u2019s arrival in Hollywood, he bluntly stated\nhis revolutionary intent. He vowed to create \u201ca completely new way of making\nmovies,\u201d as he put it to _Wired_. Amazon set up a page so that anyone, no\nmatter their experience, could submit scripts for consideration. It promised\nthat it would let data drive the projects it commissioned\u2014some in the company\nliked to describe this as the marriage of \u201cart and science.\u201d\n\nThis bluster about Amazon\u2019s heterodox approach turned out to be unreflective\nof the course it would chart. When it streamed its second batch of pilots, in\n2014, it analyzed viewing patterns, then set aside the evidence. Bezos walked\ninto the green-light meeting and announced that Amazon needed to press forward\nwith the least-watched of the five pilots: _Transparent_ , a show about a\ntransgender parent of three adult children. Bezos had read the rave reviews\nand made up his mind.\n\nThe critical success of _Transparent_ set the template for Amazon Studios. In\nthe early 2010s, the best talent still preferred to work for cable networks.\nFor a new platform to pry that talent away and attract viewers, it needed to\ngenerate attention, to schedule a noisy slate. Instead of playing to the\nmasses, Amazon defined itself as an indie studio, catering to urban upper-\nmiddle-class tastes, although the executives in Seattle were hardly hipsters\nthemselves. One former executive from Amazon\u2019s book-publishing arm told me, \u201cI\nremember when Lena Dunham\u2019s proposal was going out, they were like, \u2018Who is\nLena Dunham?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs a nascent venture, Amazon Studios was forced to hew closely to one of\nAmazon\u2019s Leadership Principles: Frugality. Executives rummaged through other\ncompanies\u2019 rejection piles for unconventional scripts. It bought _Catastrophe_\n, a cast-aside comedy, for $100,000 an episode. With the BBC, it acquired the\nfirst season of _Fleabag_ for about $3 million.\n\nParsimony proved to be a creative stimulant. The studio\u2019s risky projects were\nawards magnets. Amazon won Golden Globes in all five years it was in\ncontention. When the camera panned for black-tie reaction shots to these\nvictories, the glare of Bezos\u2019s unmistakable scalp would jump off the screen.\nAccording to his colleagues, these awards provided him with palpable pleasure,\nand he thrust himself into their pursuit. To curry favor with those who cast\nballots for big prizes, he hosted parties at his Beverly Hills property, which\nhad once been owned by DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen.\n\nReading interviews with Bezos from back in the days of his rapid ascent, it\u2019s\nhard to believe that he ever imagined becoming a king of Hollywood or that\nleading men like Matt Damon would drape their arms over his shoulders and pose\nfor photographs as if they were chums. When he talked about his own nerdiness,\nhe was self-effacing, sometimes painfully so. He once told _Playboy_ , \u201cI am\nnot the kind of person women fall in love with. I sort of grow on them, like a\nfungus.\u201d\n\nBezos at a Blue Origin event this spring. He funds that venture\u2014which builds\ninfrastructure for extraterrestrial voyage\u2014by selling about $1 billion of\nAmazon stock each year. Bezos calls Blue Origin his \u201cmost important work.\u201d\n(Mark Wilson / Getty)\n\nWhen Bezos attended the 2013 _Vanity Fair_ Oscars party, he didn\u2019t act as if\nhe owned the room. Still, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin kept to a\ncorner, Bezos and his now ex-wife, MacKenzie, circulated through the throngs.\nThey might have clung to each other, but they also gamely engaged whoever\napproached them. MacKenzie once admitted to _Vogue_ that her introversion made\nher nervous at such events, but she described her husband as a \u201cvery social\nguy.\u201d\n\nHollywood, both the business and the scene, is an intoxicant. Just as in\nWashington, Bezos immersed himself in a new culture. Paparazzi captured him\nyachting with the media mogul Barry Diller. He got to know the powerful agent\nPatrick Whitesell, whose wife, Lauren Sanchez, would later become Bezos\u2019s\ngirlfriend. He began to appear at the parties of famous producers, such as\nMark Burnett, the creator of _Survivor_ and _The Apprentice_. As one Hollywood\nexecutive told me, \u201cBezos is always showing up. He would go to the opening of\nan envelope.\u201d\n\n **B** ezos has justified Amazon\u2019s investment in Hollywood with a quip: \u201cWhen\nwe win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.\u201d This is an intentionally\nglib way of saying that Amazon is different from its competitors. It\u2019s not\njust a streaming service (like Netflix) or a constellation of channels (like\nComcast), although it\u2019s both of those things. Amazon is an enclosed ecosystem,\nand it hopes that its video offerings will prove a relatively inexpensive\nmethod of convincing people to live within it.\n\nAmazon\u2019s goal is visible in one of the metrics that it uses to judge the\nsuccess of its programming. It examines the viewing habits of users who sign\nup for free trials of Amazon Prime, and then calculates how many new\nsubscriptions to the service a piece of programming generates. As it\ndeliberates over a show\u2019s fate, Amazon considers a program\u2019s production costs\nrelative to the new subscriptions it yields. In the earliest days of the\nstudio, nice reviews might have been enough to overcome these analytics. But\nAmazon has demonstrated that it will cancel even a Golden Globe winner, such\nas _I Love Dick_ , if the metrics suggest that fate.\n\nBack in the \u201960s, countercultural critiques of television regarded it as a\nform of narcotic that induced a state of mindless consumerism. That\u2019s not an\nunfair description of television\u2019s role in Prime\u2019s subscription model. Despite\nits own hyperrational approach to the world, Amazon wants to short-circuit the\neconomic decision making of its consumers. Sunil Gupta, a Harvard Business\nSchool professor who has studied the company, told me, \u201cWhen Amazon started\nPrime, it cost $79 and the benefit was two-day free shipping. Now, most smart\npeople will do the math and they will ask, _Is $79 worth it?_ But Bezos says,\n_I don\u2019t want you to do this math. So I\u2019ll throw in movies and other benefits\nthat make the computation of value difficult_.\u201d\n\nWhen Bezos creates the terms for his business, or for society, he\u2019s no more\ncapable of dispassion than anyone else. To live in the world of his creation\nis to live in a world of his biases and predilections.\n\nWhen Amazon first created Prime, in 2005, Bezos insisted that the price be set\nhigh enough that the program felt like a genuine commitment. Consumers would\nthen set out to redeem this sizable outlay by faithfully consuming through\nAmazon. One hundred million Prime subscribers later, this turned out to be a\nmasterstroke of behavioral economics. Prime members in the U.S. spend $1,400 a\nyear on Amazon purchases, compared with $600 by nonmembers, according to a\nsurvey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It found that 93 percent of\nPrime customers keep their subscription after the first year; 98 percent keep\nit after the second. Through Prime, Bezos provided himself a deep pool of\ncash: When subscriptions auto-renew each year, the company instantly has\nbillions in its pockets. Bezos has turned his site into an almost unthinking\nhabit. _The Marvelous Mrs._ _Maisel_ and _Jack Ryan_ are essential tools for\npatterning your existence.\n\nAs Bezos has deepened his involvement in the studio, it has begun to make\nbigger bets that reflect his sensibility. It spent $250 million to acquire the\nrights to produce a _Lord of the Rings_ TV series. It reportedly paid nine\nfigures for the services of the husband-and-wife team behind HBO\u2019s _Westworld_\nand has plans to adapt novels by such sci-fi eminences as Neal Stephenson and\nWilliam Gibson. Bezos has involved himself in wrangling some of these\nprojects. He made personal pleas to J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s estate as the _Lord of\nthe Rings_ deal hung in the balance. An agent told me that Bezos has emailed\ntwo of his clients directly; Amazon executives apply pressure by invoking his\nname in calls: _He\u2019s asking about this project every day_.\n\n[Read: Why Amazon just spent a fortune to turn \u2018 _Lord of the Rings\u2019_ into\nTV](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/amazon-and-the-myth-\nof-moneyball-media/545792/)\n\nAs a kid, Bezos would spend summers at his grandfather\u2019s ranch in Cotulla,\nTexas, where he would help castrate bulls and install pipes. He would also\nwatch soap operas with his grandmother. But his primary entertainment during\nthose long days was science fiction. A fanatic of the genre had donated a\nrobust collection to the local library, and Bezos tore his way through shelves\nof Isaac Asimov and Jules Verne. Describing his affinity for the novels of the\nsci-fi writer Iain M. Banks, he once said, \u201cThere\u2019s a utopian element to it\nthat I find very attractive.\u201d The comment contains a flash of self-awareness.\nFor all his technocratic instincts, for all his training as an engineer and a\nhedge-fund quant, a romantic impulse coexists with his rationalism, and\nsometimes overrides it.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting that Bezos\u2019s lone brush with scandal transpired in\nHollywood. What befuddled so many of his admirers is that the scandal revealed\na streak of indiscipline that doesn\u2019t mesh with the man who created a company\nso resolutely fixated on the long term, so committed to living its values. The\nexpectation embedded in this confusion is unfair. While the culture has\nsometimes touted Bezos as a superhero, he\u2019s an earthling in the end. When he\ncreates the terms for his business, or for society, he\u2019s no more capable of\ndispassion than anyone else. To live in the world of Bezos\u2019s creation is to\nlive in a world of his biases and predilections.\n\n## 5.0\n\nI\u2019m loath to look back at my Amazon purchase history, decades long and filled\nwith items of questionable necessity. The recycling bin outside my house,\nstuffed full of cardboard covered with arrows bent into smiles, tells enough\nof a story. I sometimes imagine that the smile represents the company having a\ngood laugh at me. My fidelity to Amazon comes despite my record of criticizing\nit.\n\nWhen we depend on Amazon, Amazon gains leverage over us. To sell through the\nsite is to be subjected to a system of discipline and punishment. Amazon\neffectively dictates the number of items that a seller can place in a box, and\nthe size of the boxes it will handle. (To adhere to Amazon\u2019s stringent\nrequirements, a pet-food company recently reduced its packaging by 34\npercent.) Failure to comply with the rules results in a monetary fine. If a\ncompany that sells through Amazon Marketplace feels wronged, it has little\nrecourse, because its contract relinquishes the right to sue. These are just\nthe terms of service.\n\nThe man who styles himself as the heroic Jean-Luc Picard has built a business\nthat better resembles Picard\u2019s archenemy, the Borg, which informs its victims,\n_You will be assimilated_ and _Resistance is futile_.\n\nIs there even a choice about Amazon anymore? This is a question that haunts\nbusinesses far more than consumers. Companies such as Nike resisted Amazon for\nyears; they poured money into setting up their own e-commerce sites. But even\nwhen Nike didn\u2019t sell its products on Amazon, more Nike apparel was sold on\nthe site than any other brand. Anyone could peddle Nike shoes on Amazon\nwithout having to explain how they obtained their inventory. Because Amazon\nMarketplace had become a pipeline connecting Chinese factories directly to\nAmerican homes, it also served as a conduit for counterfeit goods, a constant\ngripe of Nike\u2019s. _Wired_ reported that, at one point during this year\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s World Cup, six of Amazon\u2019s 10 best-selling jerseys appeared to be\nknockoffs. To have any hope of controlling this market, Nike concluded that it\nhad no option but to join its rival. (Amazon has said that it prohibits the\nsale of counterfeit products.)\n\nBen Thompson, the founder of Stratechery, a website that vivisects Silicon\nValley companies, has incisively described Amazon\u2019s master plan. He argues\nthat the company wants to provide logistics \u201cfor basically everyone and\neverything,\u201d because if everything flows through Amazon, the company will be\npositioned to collect a \u201ctax\u201d on a stunning array of transactions. When Amazon\nsells subscriptions to premium cable channels such as Showtime and Starz, it\nreportedly takes anywhere from a 15 to 50 percent cut. While an item sits in\nan Amazon warehouse waiting to be purchased, the seller pays a rental fee.\nAmazon allows vendors to buy superior placement in its search results (it then\nmarks those results as sponsored), and it has carved up the space on its own\npages so that they can be leased as advertising. If a business hopes to gain\naccess to Amazon\u2019s economies of scale, it has to pay the tolls. The man who\nstyles himself as the heroic Jean-Luc Picard has thus built a business that\nbetter resembles Picard\u2019s archenemy, the Borg, a society-swallowing entity\nthat informs victims, _You will be assimilated_ and _Resistance is futile_.\n\nIn the end, all that is admirable and fearsome about Amazon converges. Every\nitem can be found on its site, which makes it the greatest shopping experience\never conceived. Every item can be found on its site, which means market power\nis dangerously concentrated in one company. Amazon\u2019s smart speakers have the\nmagical power to translate the spoken word into electronic action; Amazon\u2019s\ndoorbell cameras have the capacity to send video to the police, expanding the\nsurveillance state. With its unique management structure and crystalline\narticulation of values and comprehensive collection of data, Amazon\neffortlessly scales into new businesses, a reason to marvel and cower. Jeff\nBezos has won capitalism. The question for the democracy is, are we okay with\nthat?\n\n**O** n Jeff Bezos\u2019s ranch in West Texas, there is a mountain. Burrowed inside\nits hollowed-out core is a cascading tower of interlaced Geneva wheels,\nlevers, and a bimetallic spring. These innards, still not fully assembled,\nwill move the Clock of the Long Now, a timepiece that has been designed to run\nwith perfect accuracy for 10,000 years, with a hand that advances with each\nturn of the century. Bezos has supplied $42 million to fund the clock\u2019s\nconstruction, an attempt to dislodge humans from the present moment, to extend\nthe species\u2019 sense of time. Bezos has argued that if humans \u201cthink long term,\nwe can accomplish things that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise accomplish.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n####  Related Stories\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ebyQhWnox3-BElnkd0cOS9RB3Uw=/297x2185:1539x2954/250x155/media/img/2013/10/11/1113_DIS_Thompson_BizAmazon/original.jpg)](/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-\nriddle-of-amazon/309523/)\n\n  * [The Amazon Mystery: What America's Strangest Tech Company Is Really Up To](/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-riddle-of-amazon/309523/)\n  * [Franklin Foer: Paul Manafort, American Hustler](/magazine/archive/2018/03/paul-manafort-american-hustler/550925/)\n\n* * *\n\nPerformance reviews at Amazon ask employees to name their \u201csuperpower.\u201d An\nemployer probably shouldn\u2019t create the expectation that its staff members\npossess qualities that extend beyond mortal reach, but I\u2019m guessing Bezos\nwould answer by pointing to his ability to think into the future. He dwells on\nthe details without sacrificing his clarity about the ultimate destination.\nIt\u2019s why he can simultaneously prod one company to master the grocery business\nwhile he pushes another to send astronauts to the moon by 2024, in the hope\nthat humans will eventually mine the astronomical body for the resources\nneeded to sustain colonies. Bezos has no hope of ever visiting one of these\ncolonies, which wouldn\u2019t arise until long after his death, but that fact does\nnothing to diminish the intensity of his efforts.\n\n[Read: Jeff Bezos has plans to extract the moon\u2019s\nwater](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/jeff-bezos-moon-\nnasa/589150/)\n\nThat Donald Trump has picked Jeff Bezos as a foil is fitting. They represent\ndueling reactions to the dysfunction of so much of American life. In the face\nof the manipulative emotionalism of this presidency, it\u2019s hard not to pine for\na technocratic alternative, to yearn for a utopia of competence and rules. As\nTrump runs down the country, Bezos builds things that function as promised.\n\nYet the erosion of democracy comes in different forms. Untrammeled private\npower might not seem the biggest threat when public power takes such abusive\nform. But the country needs to think like Bezos and consider the longer sweep\nof history before permitting so much responsibility to pool in one man, who,\nwithout ever receiving a vote, assumes roles once reserved for the state. His\ncompany has become the shared national infrastructure; it shapes the future of\nthe workplace with its robots; it will populate the skies with its drones; its\nwebsite determines which industries thrive and which fall to the side. His\ninvestments in space travel may remake the heavens. The incapacity of the\npolitical system to ponder the problem of his power, let alone check it,\nguarantees his Long Now.

As the Lunar New\nYear holiday approached its end, [DingTalk, an enterprise\napp](https://qz.com/work/1087614/alibaba-ding-ding-china-slack/) from\ne-commerce giant Alibaba, suddenly jumped 37 spots to become the 3rd most\ndownloaded free iOS app in China, according to metrics research firm App\nAnnie.\n\nIt\u2019s [been in the No. 1\nspot](https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/top/china/overall/iphone/) all this\nweek, as some firms that had taken an extended New Year holiday returned to\nwork, while others continued working from home. Shenzhen-based gaming giant\nTencent, for instance, [said on\nSunday](https://www.jiemian.com/article/3960883.html) (Feb. 9, link in\nChinese) its employees in mainland China should continue working from home\nuntil Feb. 24. Alibaba, also [asked\nemployees](https://inews.hket.com/article/2555842/%E9%98%BF%E9%87%8C%E5%82%B3%E5%86%8D%E6%8E%A8%E9%81%B2%E5%BE%A9%E5%B7%A5%E8%87%B3%E5%B0%91%E4%B8%80%E5%91%A8)\n(link in Chinese) to keep working from home until further notice, as has\n[drone maker DJI](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/10/business/china-companies-\nreturn-to-work-coronavirus/index.html).\n\nSome firms, however, are experimenting with getting back to the office. Search\nengine giant Baidu allowed small groups of employees to go back to the office\nthis week, but required them to first get approval from supervisors and also\nshow they had been under quarantine for more than 14 days if they had traveled\nto the worst-affected province of Hubei, according to an internal memo seen by\nQuartz.\n\nAmid extra work from companies trying to keep productivity up, and suffocating\nmonitoring by managers unused to managing remote teams, some employees are\nstarting to think the office is not so bad, even if they face a [\u201c996\u201d\nschedule](https://qz.com/1589309/996-icu-github-hosts-chinese-tech-worker-\ncomplaints/)\u20149am to 9pm, six days a week\u2014there.\n\n\u201cThis is not work-from-home, this is the worker being put on \u2018forced\nquarantine,'\u201d said a Beijing-based tech worker, who declined to give her name\nbecause company policy doesn\u2019t allow her to speak to the press. \u201cI don\u2019t even\nhave time to have a coffee and meet friends now, after working from home for a\nweek.\u201d\n\n## Selfie and live-stream check-ins\n\nAt the core of the issue is probably a low level of trust on the part of some\nmanagers, especially at smaller firms that don\u2019t count on the sorts of tools\ntheir bigger peers use for coordinating with workers and gauging productivity.\nOn Maimai, [LinkedIn\u2019s biggest rival in\nChina](https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2120063/maimai-linkedins-\nbiggest-china-rival-raises-us750m-funding-and-aims), where workers share\noffice gossip and job leads in online forums, some workers described ad hoc\nsurveillance measures bosses have subjected them to this week.\n\n\u201cI am so mad. My supervisor asked me to send them a selfie every half an hour,\nand share my real-time location with them using WeChat\u2026 I suspect my manager\ndoesn\u2019t really trust me. What should I do?\u201d [asked user Chen\nRenyi](https://maimai.cn/web/feed_detail?fid=1412427220&efid=Kbfz9OGo0rnqNx9A7BvEbQ&use_rn=1),\nwho identified himself as working for a media company in Beijing. In [another\npost](https://maimai.cn/web/feed_detail?fid=1409621648&efid=ADq1xSxZCCeKOSiubUa26Q&use_rn=1),\nuser Wu Tiantian, who works for an internet company, complained that her\nsalary was deducted because she was wearing pajamas while attending a company\nvideo conference call that morning. Wu also attached a screenshot showing a\nrequest from her company asking employees to join two video conferences at 9\nam and 6 pm everyday, and to reply to work-related messages within 10 minutes\non DingTalk.\n\nAn employee who claimed to work for Meituan Dianping, a food-delivery firm\nthat has asked employees to work from home through next week, complained in a\npost that they were asked by their department to keep cameras switched on to\n\u201clive stream how they work.\u201d \u201cThis makes me feel so suffocated,\u201d said the\nuser. Wei Fangyi, a recruiting manager at Meituan whose identity was verified\nby the Maimai app, [replied to the\npost](https://maimai.cn/web/gossip_detail?src=app&webid=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlZ2lkIjoiMmM1ZmFjMGE0NTZlMTFlYTk3ZDE4MDE4NDRlNTAxOTAiLCJ1IjoxODc1NjMzMjYsImlkIjoyNDk4MjYzMX0.5dYBSduqahJ3xMQnE8_EV86PYYlZNIIcKOs-\nUfy7FKQ) saying the company hadn\u2019t made any such request of employees, and\nsuggested that the employee bring the matter to managers if they were again\nasked to keep cameras switched on. Meituan Dianping referred Quartz to Wei\u2019s\nresponse on the matter.\n\nEven when not facing monitoring, many say it hasn\u2019t been easy. A Hangzhou-\nbased worker at Chinese fintech giant Ant Financial told Quartz that she needs\nto do video conferences every morning\u2014while also entertaining a child who\u2019s\nhome all day, with schools shut for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe company also requires us to write daily work journals, although lots of\nemployees didn\u2019t end up doing that. I am as crazily busy working at home as\nwhen working in the office. It is still the normal work hours for me, but now\nthere is not even a boundary between work and life as I stay at home all the\ntime,\u201d she said, adding that she even missed the long commute to her head\noffice. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to be bothered by my child when working in the\noffice.\u201d\n\n## A universe of Chinese work apps\n\nFor bigger companies, the concern is more about how to make sure the work\nexperience is smooth for not only its own employees, but also for corporate\nusers who rely on the firms\u2019 online work tools to stay connected. Since\nChina\u2019s great firewall blocks major Western websites like Google and Facebook,\nChina\u2019s work-at-home processes depend on domestic tech giants who offer their\nown counterparts of Google Doc or Slack\u2014often with many more features.\n\nUsers from around 10 million corporations used DingTalk last Monday (Feb. 3),\n[causing temporary disruptions](https://weibo.com/5482144242/Ist5RAN1V) (link\nin Chinese), according to a post from the company on social network Weibo. The\napp also has 200 million unaffiliated users. On DingTalk, users can create\nteam chat groups, look at organizational charts, and video-conference. The app\ncan also track attendance an overtime hours automatically. **  \n**\n\nSocial media giant Tencent has also seen more demand for its work tools\u2014both\nWeChat Work, the corporate version of the ubiquitous WeChat app, and\nvideoconferencing tool Tencent Meeting, are among the top five most downloaded\nfree iOS apps in China, according to App Annie. WeChat Work is used by over\n2.5 million enterprises, covering 60 million corporate users, according to\nTencent, which added that the app recorded a tenfold increase on Feb. 10, when\nmany firms and schools resumed work after the break.\n\n\u201cWe feel encouraged that we have made products that can help millions of\npeople across China to \u2018keep life going on\u2019 during this challenging time,\u201d the\ncompany said.\n\nCompared with their peers like Slack, the Chinese apps have been quick to meet\nsome of the unique demands seen among Chinese employees. DingTalk, for\nexample, introduced [a beautify\nfilter](https://weibo.com/5482144242/IsLhuoqSJ) to its video-conferencing\nfeature. Meanwhile, [Feishu](https://www.feishu.cn/), an enterprise messaging\napp from TikTok owner ByteDance that allows file sharing and document editing,\nrolled out a \u201c[health management\u201d\nplatform](https://www.feishu.cn/product/applications/health-\nmanagement?intcmpid=cn-fes-ban-homewhatsnew-020420-healthmanagement) in\nresponse to the coronavirus where workers can log their location and daily\ntemperature. The app is being used by [over 50,000\nemployees](https://en.pingwest.com/a/5800) at ByteDance, according to Xie Xin,\nthe head of Feishu.\n\nNot all features adapt well to working from home, though. DingTalk, for\nexample, can use location-tagging [to see if employees actually went to the\ndoctor](https://qz.com/work/1087614/alibaba-ding-ding-china-slack/), and to\nclock them in at work. But if a worker is only moving between the dining room\nand the kitchen, that tracking ability isn\u2019t quite as useful.\n\n[![The Memo from Quartz at Work](https://cms.qz.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/quartz-at-work/)\n\n[\n\n##### The Memo from Quartz at Work\n\n](/emails/quartz-at-work/)\n\n##### Did you get The Memo?

However, as with all software, it's critical to understand how to get\nthe most out of it.\n\nHere's a look at some of the ways HR and managers can make the best use of SAP\nSuccessFactors Talent Management applications.\n\n### __1\\. Use the right tools to manage the employee journey\n\nSuccessFactors Talent Management has a suite of applications to help manage\nthe entire employee journey. HR can use the Recruiting tool to match external\nand internal talent to job openings. The tool can also provide employees with\nopportunities to find jobs internally.\n\nHR and managers can [use the Onboarding tool\n](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/answer/What-are-some-key-SuccessFactors-\nonboarding-capabilities)to help new employees prepare for their first day,\nwhich can help lower new job anxieties, acclimate them to the company culture\nand, in turn, [help improve\nretention](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/answer/How-can-SAP-SuccessFactors-\nOnboarding-help-retain-employees).\n\nHR and managers can use the Succession & Development tool to create career\npaths and employee development plans. Coupled with the Learning tool, these\ndevelopment objectives can help employees get the skills they need for career\ngrowth within the organization. As part of monitoring that progress, the\nPerformance & Goals tool measures performance and identifies new areas of\npersonal development.\n\n### __2\\. Manage processes with homepage tiles\n\nIT administrators can set up both standard and custom tiles, which provide\nemployees with notifications, reminders, information, links and other\nresources to assist with talent processes.\n\n> Coupled with the Learning tool, development objectives can help employees\n> get the skills they need for career growth within the organization.  __\n\nThe To-Do tiles give visual reminders and statuses on talent processes. For\nexample, the Review Performance tile gives an overview of performance\nmanagement forms for a manager's team.\n\nThe My Team tile feature offers a view of team summary information. Managers\ncan use tile functionality to view and manage a team and [provide spot\nbonuses](https://www.tlnt.com/spot-awards-are-good-until-theyre-not/).\n\n### __3\\. Use People Profile to track workforce attributes\n\nPeople Profile lists an employee and the constellation of information that\nhelps managers and HR manage talent, such as skills, interest and experience.\nIt also lists information such as where that person fits within the\ninteractive organizational chart using self-services, although basic details\nare populated automatically and managers can also use self-services to update\ninformation on their team. Managers can use People Profile to review potential\nsuccessors, identify skills and competencies, and measure performance against\npotential.\n\n### __4\\. Set clear and attainable organization goals\n\nManagers can use the Performance & Goals application to assign annual goals to\nemployees. Assigning goals to employees gives them a focus to grow personally\nand also helps support the organization in reaching its goals.\n\n### __5\\. Go mobile\n\nThe SuccessFactors mobile app gives real-time, on-the-go access to talent\nprocesses. Whether it's onboarding new employees, managing employee learning\nand training, or managing a continuous performance management process, the\nmobile app offers a way to perform these activities on the go. [Admins can set\nup](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/The-importance-of-a-backup-\nfor-your-HR-system-administrator) urgent notifications, and users can take\nactions through the app.\n\n### __6\\. Capitalize on analytics\n\nWith the new People Analytics tool, creating and viewing various charts, key\nperformance indicators and analytics is even easier. Administrators can create\ncustom reports and templates, and managers and HR can use in-page analytics\nthat exist across the suite of modules.\n\n### __7\\. Check out overlooked cross-module features\n\nThe SAP SuccessFactors platform contains features that HR leaders and others\nmight overlook when IT [implements the\nsystem](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/tip/The-only-SAP-SuccessFactors-\nimplementation-checklist-you-need) one module at a time. Presentations, Talent\nSearch and Job Profile Builder are among some of the features that are not\ntied to any particular module but can add value across many of the talent\nmodules.  \n  \nAdmins can use presentations to create interactive talent presentations that\ndisplay data from the system in real time. Job Profile Builder provides a\nframework to build job profiles and the elements that are used across company\nprofiles, such as job requirements, experience, responsibilities and\ncompetencies. Skills Profile provides a means to assign skills to employees\nand rate them on those skills.\n\n####  Related Resources\n\n  * [Workplace Revolution: How HR technology is transforming the way we work](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1511371219_259.html) -ComputerWeekly.com\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on SAP SuccessFactors\n\n  * [\n\n##### Case study: Logistics firm GWC moves from paper to digital HR in three\nmonths\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/39740_bill-goodwin-.jpg) By:\nBill Goodwin ](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252443830/Case-study-\nLogistics-firm-GWC-moves-from-paper-to-digital-HR-in-three-months)\n\n  * [\n\n##### SAP SuccessFactors\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse ](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/definition/SAP-\nSuccessFactors)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Comparing the best HR software and HCM system options\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/shacklett_mary.jpg) By: Mary\nShacklett ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Comparing-the-\nbest-HR-software-and-HCM-system-options)\n\n  * [\n\n##### See what the best talent management software is for you\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/shacklett_mary.jpg) By: Mary\nShacklett ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/See-what-the-best-\ntalent-management-software-is-for-you)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/marson_luke.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Luke-Marson)\n\n[Luke Marson](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Luke-Marson) asks:\n\n## How would you make the best use of SuccessFactors Talent Management?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n#### __Related Q &A; from [Luke\nMarson](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Luke-Marson)\n\n##### [What capabilities does Qualtrics EmployeeXM\noffer?](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/answer/What-capabilities-does-\nQualtrics-EmployeeXM-offer)\n\nEmployee Experience Management tools from Qualtrics are meant to give managers\nand HR concrete ways to gather feedback and support workers.

If a series has already been\ncreated, Instagram notes, creators can add episodes to the existing project --\nand similarly, creators can also delete videos from series by tapping on that\nvideo, and then selecting the \u2018Remove From Series\u2019 option on the workflow\nmenu.\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n[![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/instagram-\nads-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/06/27/instagram-advertising-\nexplore-tab-first-time/)\n\n### [Instagram Will Integrate Ads Into 'Explore' Tab Over Coming\nMonths](https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/06/27/instagram-advertising-explore-\ntab-first-time/)\n\n[![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jonah-\nhill-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/09/18/instagram-igtv-jonah-\nhill-un-filtered/)\n\n### [Instagram Partners With Jonah Hill On Anti-Bullying Docuseries For\nIGTV](https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/09/18/instagram-igtv-jonah-hill-un-\nfiltered/)\n\n  * [__](https://www.facebook.com/Tubefilter \"Facebook\")\n  * [__](https://twitter.com/tubefilter \"Twitter\")\n  * [__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tubefilter \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [__](http://feeds.feedburner.com/tubefilterNews \"RSS\")\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n### TRENDING STORIES\n\n  * [![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/haerte-test-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/06/top-50-most-viewed-youtube-channels-worldwide-2020-04-06/ \"Top 50 Most Viewed YouTube Channels Worldwide \u2022 Week Of 4/6/2020\")\n\n#### [Top 50 Most Viewed YouTube Channels Worldwide \u2022 Week Of\n4/6/2020](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/06/top-50-most-viewed-youtube-\nchannels-worldwide-2020-04-06/ \"Top 50 Most Viewed YouTube Channels Worldwide\n\u2022 Week Of 4/6/2020\")\n\n  * [![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/netflix-tiger-king-views-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/07/netflix-tiger-king-youtube-views-cameo-videos/ \"Netflix\u2019s \u2018Tiger King\u2019 Is Most Popular TV Show In U.S., Spurring YouTube Views For Joe Exotic\")\n\n#### [Netflix's 'Tiger King' Is Most Popular TV Show In U.S., Spurring YouTube\nViews For Joe Exotic](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/07/netflix-tiger-\nking-youtube-views-cameo-videos/ \"Netflix\u2019s \u2018Tiger King\u2019 Is Most Popular TV\nShow In U.S., Spurring YouTube Views For Joe Exotic\")\n\n  * [![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/how-much-do-twitch-streamers-make-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/10/10/twitch-streamers-earn-per-month-breakdown-disguisedtoast/ \"Here\u2019s A Candid Breakdown Of Exactly How Much Money Twitch Streamers Earn Per Month\")\n\n#### [Here's A Candid Breakdown Of Exactly How Much Money Twitch Streamers\nEarn Per Month](https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/10/10/twitch-streamers-earn-\nper-month-breakdown-disguisedtoast/ \"Here\u2019s A Candid Breakdown Of Exactly How\nMuch Money Twitch Streamers Earn Per Month\")\n\n  * [![](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/masterclass-424x282.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/07/top-50-most-viewed-us-youtube-channels-2020-04-06/ \"Top 50 Most Viewed US YouTube Channels \u2022 Week Of 4/6/2020\")\n\n#### [Top 50 Most Viewed US YouTube Channels \u2022 Week Of\n4/6/2020](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/07/top-50-most-viewed-us-youtube-\nchannels-2020-04-06/ \"Top 50 Most Viewed US YouTube Channels \u2022 Week Of\n4/6/2020\")\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nTubefilter is the curator of online video.

[ Erik Eckel ](https://www.techrepublic.com/meet-the-team/us/erik-eckel/)\nin [ Software ](https://www.techrepublic.com/topic/software/) [\n](https://www.techrepublic.com/rssfeeds/topic/software/) on April 15, 2019,\n8:19 PM PST\n\nConverting ideas into action is challenging. Fortunately, new features in\nMindjet's MindManager 12 for Mac help you do just that.\n\n![mindmanager-12-hero.jpg](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/22/02d109f9-472a-47bb-b525-d58bcc6d2e6f/resize/770x/978e2d954c1be48a9af280025c56b729/mindmanager-12-hero.jpg)\n\nWhile a mind-mapping application might sound to some like a brainstorming tool\nonly creatives might require, most every organization can improve planning and\noperations when employing software that assists converting ideas and concepts\nto actionable strategies and plans that can be shared and updated. Several new\nfeatures introduced in [Mindjet's MindManager 12 for\nMac](https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager-mac/) make it even easier to develop\nideas, convert concepts to action plans, and improve team communication and\nalignment.\n\nCommon office applications--including those for creating documents,\nspreadsheets, and presentations--fall short when trying to create process\nmaps, charts, timelines, scorecards, and other common professional diagrams,\nespecially those that permit capturing ideas and concepts and converting such\nelements into actionable tools for confirming strategy, assigning\nresponsibilities, setting deadlines, tracking progress, and maintaining team\ncommunication. Specialized software fills this niche and speeds the process.\n\n **SEE:[10 essential apps and utilities for your Mac (free\nPDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-essential-\napps-and-utilities-for-your-mac-free-pdf/) (TechRepublic)**\n\nMindManager for Mac was already a potent program capable of drafting,\nproducing, and sharing diagrams. Using the application, users can create a\nrange of documents using a variety of templates, including radial maps, tree\nmaps, organizational charts, flowcharts, timelines, Venn Diagrams, concept\nmaps, funnel diagrams, onion diagrams, project management charters and plans,\nscorecards, SWOT analyses, and more.\n\nNew features introduced in version 12 further extend MindManager's usefulness.\nSmartRules extends conditional formatting capabilities to automate data\nupdates, thereby reducing the number of repetitive tasks required to produce\nand maintain map diagrams. New Objects and some 12 new Smart Shapes help\ndirect attention to specific components and build consensus around complex\ninformation presented in a way everyone can make sense of the data.\n\nA new Match Width feature permits adjusting focus to ensure presentations are\nmore readily understandable, not to mention interesting. Users can adjust the\ntopic width manually or via a single click, while applying changes to\nindividual topics or entire maps, as needed.\n\nRecording and converting whiteboard concepts and ideas to actionable plans, by\nvisually capturing, expanding, and reordering ideas, notes, and information,\nis only half the battle; process maps, diagrams, and plans typically must be\nshared with others to prove truly effective. New HTML5 and Publish\ncapabilities further extend MindManager 12's usefulness by simplifying the\nsharing of files, the creation of direct links, and encouraging and supporting\nfeedback and conversation.\n\nNew Dark Mode support ( **Figure A** ) and Touch Bar integration ensure Mac\nusers can use and operate the program in manners they prefer and are\naccustomed. Some 40 new visual presentation themes provide more variety when\ncreating or updating maps, diagrams, presentations, and other files, while new\nmapping and diagramming tools support converting XMind and FreeMind maps to\nMindManager files. Such files can now be imported directly into MindManager to\nfurther speed production and editing.\n\n**Figure A**\n\n![mindmanager-12-fig-a.png]()![mindmanager-12-fig-a.png](https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/22/2d5efc92-4d64-4731-afed-3e43e6825b99/resize/770x/062a90041a713befef6dd025716c8bb6/mindmanager-12-fig-a.png)\n\nImage: Mindjet\n\nIf you need to better manage assigned tasks and your time, consider employing\nMindManager to keep action items and corresponding supporting material\norganized, visible, and adaptable. With support for deadlines, links, notes,\nand other information, as well as the ability to re-prioritize tasks using\nsimple drag-and-drop movements, the program might be a timely solution for\nchallenges professionals face in the workplace.\n\nAnd, if you need to build and maintain team alignment, especially when\ncompleting complex projects with multiple milestones and ever-changing\nrequirements, leverage MindManager's ability to build dynamic diagrams that\ncan continually be edited and updated.\n\n **SEE:[Project manager resume template: A framework for highlighting your\nskills and achievements](http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/project-\nmanager-resume-template-a-framework-for-highlighting-your-skills-and-\nachievements/) (Tech Pro Research)**\n\n## Try MindManager 12 for Mac\n\nWhether you must create project charters or workflows and add due dates or\ntrack assigned resources while also publishing real-time updates to improve\nteam communication, all while maintaining awareness of the overall goal\nwithout losing track of important details, give MindManager 12 for Mac a try.\n\nThe system requirements should pose no worries: macOS 10.3 High Sierra or\nnewer, 250MB free disk space, and 1024x768 display resolution.\n\nFree 30-day trials are available. If you choose to license the software, the\nprice is $179. Enterprise licensing is available. MindManager 10 and 11 for\nMac users are eligible for an upgrade license, which runs $89.\n\n![](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/techrepubliccss/images/article-\nNLSthumb.jpg)\n\n### Apple Weekly Newsletter\n\nWhether you want iPhone and Mac tips or the latest enterprise-specific Apple\nnews, we've got you covered.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n## Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nEmployers continue to hire at a high rate and spend enormous sums to do it.\nBut they don't know whether their approaches are effective at finding and\nselecting good candidates.\n\n##### The Root Causes\n\nBusinesses focus on external candidates and don't track the results of their\napproaches. They often use outside vendors and high-tech tools that are\nunproven and have inherent flaws.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nReturn to filling most positions by promoting from within. Measure the results\nproduced by vendors and new tools, and be on the lookout for discrimination\nand privacy violations.\n\nBusinesses have never done as much hiring as they do today. They've never\nspent as much money doing it. And they've never done a worse job of it.\n\nFor most of the post-World War II era, large corporations went about hiring\nthis way: Human resources experts prepared a detailed _job analysis_ to\ndetermine what tasks the job required and what attributes a good candidate\nshould have. Next they did a _job evaluation_ to determine how the job fit\ninto the organizational chart and how much it should pay, especially compared\nwith other jobs. Ads were posted, and applicants applied. Then came the task\nof sorting through the applicants. That included skills tests, reference\nchecks, maybe personality and IQ tests, and extensive interviews to learn more\nabout them as people. William H. Whyte, in The Organization Man, described\nthis process as going on for as long as a week before the winning candidate\nwas offered the job. The vast majority of non-entry-level openings were filled\nfrom within.\n\nToday's approach couldn't be more different. Census data shows, for example,\nthat the majority of people who took a new job last year weren't searching for\none: Somebody came and got them. Companies seek to fill their recruiting\nfunnel with as many candidates as possible, especially \"passive candidates,\"\nwho aren't looking to move. Often employers advertise jobs that don't exist,\nhoping to find people who might be useful later on or in a different context.\n\nThe recruiting and hiring function has been eviscerated. Many U.S. companies--\nabout 40%, according to\n[research](https://staging.kornferry.com/media/sidebar_downloads/Measuring-Up-\nA-new-research-report-about-RPO-metrics.pdf) by Korn Ferry--have outsourced\nmuch if not all of the hiring process to \"recruitment process outsourcers,\"\nwhich in turn often use subcontractors, typically in India and the\nPhilippines. The subcontractors scour LinkedIn and social media to find\npotential candidates. They sometimes contact them directly to see whether they\ncan be persuaded to apply for a position and negotiate the salary they're\nwilling to accept. (The recruiters get incentive pay if they negotiate the\namount down.) To hire programmers, for example, these subcontractors can scan\nwebsites that programmers might visit, trace their \"digital exhaust\" from\ncookies and other user-tracking measures to identify who they are, and then\nexamine their curricula vitae.\n\nAt companies that still do their own recruitment and hiring, managers trying\nto fill open positions are largely left to figure out what the jobs require\nand what the ads should say. When applications come--always electronically--\napplicant-tracking software sifts through them for key words that the hiring\nmanagers want to see. Then the process moves into the Wild West, where a new\nindustry of vendors offer an astonishing array of smart-sounding tools that\nclaim to predict who will be a good hire. They use voice recognition, body\nlanguage, clues on social media, and especially machine learning algorithms--\neverything but tea leaves. Entire publications are devoted to what these\nvendors are doing.\n\nThe big problem with all these new practices is that we don't know whether\nthey actually produce satisfactory hires. Only about a third of U.S. companies\nreport that they monitor whether their hiring practices lead to good\nemployees; few of them do so carefully, and only a minority even track cost\nper hire and time to hire. Imagine if the CEO asked how an advertising\ncampaign had gone, and the response was \"We have a good idea how long it took\nto roll out and what it cost, but we haven't looked to see whether we're\nselling more.\"\n\nHiring talent remains the number one concern of CEOs in the most recent\nConference Board Annual Survey; it's also the top concern of the entire\nexecutive suite. PwC's 2017 CEO survey reports that chief executives view the\nunavailability of talent and skills as the biggest threat to their business.\nEmployers also spend an enormous amount on hiring--an average of $4,129 per\njob in the United States, according to Society for Human Resource Management\nestimates, and many times that amount for managerial roles--and the United\nStates fills a staggering 66 million jobs a year. Most of the $20 billion that\ncompanies spend on human resources vendors goes to hiring.\n\nWhy do employers spend so much on something so important while knowing so\nlittle about whether it works?\n\n## Where the Problem Starts\n\nSurvey after survey finds employers complaining about how difficult hiring is.\nThere may be many explanations, such as their having become very picky about\ncandidates, especially in the slack labor market of the Great Recession. But\nclearly they are hiring much more than at any other time in modern history,\nfor two reasons.\n\nThe first is that openings are now filled more often by hiring from the\noutside than by promoting from within. In the era of lifetime employment, from\nthe end of World War II through the 1970s, corporations filled roughly 90% of\ntheir vacancies through promotions and lateral assignments. Today the figure\nis a third or less. When they hire from outside, organizations don't have to\npay to train and develop their employees. Since the restructuring waves of the\nearly 1980s, it has been relatively easy to find experienced talent outside.\nOnly 28% of talent acquisition leaders today report that internal candidates\nare an important source of people to fill vacancies--presumably because of\nless internal development and fewer clear career ladders.\n\nLess promotion internally means that hiring efforts are no longer concentrated\non entry-level jobs and recent graduates. (If you doubt this, go to the\n\"careers\" link on any company website and look for a job opening that doesn't\nrequire prior experience.) Now companies must be good at hiring across most\nlevels, because the candidates they want are already doing the job somewhere\nelse. These people don't need training, so they may be ready to contribute\nright away, but they are much harder to find.\n\nThe second reason hiring is so difficult is that retention has become tough:\nCompanies hire from their competitors and vice versa, so they have to keep\nreplacing people who leave. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows\nthat 95% of hiring is done to fill existing positions. Most of those vacancies\nare caused by voluntary turnover. LinkedIn data indicates that the most common\nreason employees consider a position elsewhere is career advancement--which is\nsurely related to employers' not promoting to fill vacancies.\n\nThe root cause of most hiring, therefore, is drastically poor retention. Here\nare some simple ways to fix that:\n\n### Track the percentage of openings filled from within.\n\nAn adage of business is that we manage what we measure, but companies don't\nseem to be applying that maxim to tracking hires. Most are shocked to learn\nhow few of their openings are filled from within--is it really the case that\ntheir people can't handle different and bigger roles?\n\n### Require that all openings be posted internally.\n\nInternal job boards were created during the dot-com boom to reduce turnover by\nmaking it easier for people to find new jobs within their existing employer.\nManagers weren't even allowed to know if a subordinate was looking to move\nwithin the company, for fear that they would try to block that person and he\nor she would leave. But during the Great Recession employees weren't quitting,\nand many companies slid back to the old model whereby managers could prevent\ntheir subordinates from moving internally. JR Keller, of Cornell University,\nhas found that when managers could fill a vacancy with someone they already\nhad in mind, they ended up with employees who performed more poorly than those\nhired when the job had been posted and anyone could apply. The commonsense\nexplanation for this is that few enterprises really know what talent and\ncapabilities they have.\n\n#### Protecting Against Discrimination\n\nFinding out whether your practices result in good hires is not only basic to\ngood management but the only real defense against claims of adverse impact and\ndiscrimination. Other than white males under age 40 with no disabilities or\nwork-related health problems, workers have special protections under federal\nand state laws against hiring practices that may have an adverse impact on\nthem. As a practical matter, that means if members of a particular group are\nless likely to be recruited or hired, the employer must show that the hiring\nprocess is not discriminatory.\n\nThe only defense against evidence of adverse impact is for the employer to\nshow that its hiring practices are valid--that is, they predict who will be a\ngood employee in meaningful and statistically significant ways--and that no\nalternative would predict as well with less adverse impact. That analysis must\nbe conducted with data on the employer's own applicants and hires. The fact\nthat the vendor that sold you the test you use has evidence that it was valid\nin other contexts is not sufficient.\n\n### Recognize the costs of outside hiring.\n\nIn addition to the time and effort of hiring, my colleague Matthew Bidwell\nfound, outside hires take three years to perform as well as internal hires in\nthe same job, while internal hires take seven years to earn as much as outside\nhires are paid. Outside hiring also causes current employees to spend time and\nenergy positioning themselves for jobs elsewhere. It disrupts the culture and\nburdens peers who must help new hires figure out how things work.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that outside hiring is necessarily a bad idea. But\nunless your company is a Silicon Valley gazelle, adding new jobs at a furious\npace, you should ask yourself some serious questions if most of your openings\nare being filled from outside.\n\nEmployers are obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs.\n\nA different approach for dealing with retention (which seems creepy to some)\nis to try to determine who is interested in leaving and then intervene.\nVendors like Jobvite comb social media and public sites for clues, such as\nLinkedIn profile updates. Measuring \"flight risk\" is one of the most common\ngoals of companies that do their own sophisticated HR analytics. This is\nreminiscent of the early days of job boards, when employers would try to find\nout who was posting resumes and either punish them or embrace them, depending\non leadership's mood.\n\nWhether companies should be examining social media content in relation to\nhiring or any other employment action is a challenging ethical question. On\none hand, the information is essentially public and may reveal relevant\ninformation. On the other hand, it is invasive, and candidates are rarely\nasked for permission to scrutinize their information. Hiring a private\ndetective to shadow a candidate would also gather public information that\nmight be relevant, yet most people would view it as an unacceptable invasion\nof privacy.\n\n## The Hiring Process\n\nWhen we turn to hiring itself, we find that employers are missing the forest\nfor the trees: Obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs, they\nlargely ignore the ultimate goal: making the best possible hires. Here's how\nthe process should be revamped:\n\n### Don't post \"phantom jobs.\"\n\nIt costs nothing to post job openings on a company website, which are then\nscooped up by Indeed and other online companies and pushed out to potential\njob seekers around the world. Thus it may be unsurprising that some of these\njobs don't really exist. Employers may simply be fishing for candidates.\n(\"Let's see if someone really great is out there, and if so, we'll create a\nposition for him or her.\") Often job ads stay up even after positions have\nbeen filled, to keep collecting candidates for future vacancies or just\nbecause it takes more effort to pull the ad down than to leave it up.\nSometimes ads are posted by unscrupulous recruiters looking for resumes to\npitch to clients elsewhere. Because these phantom jobs make the labor market\nlook tighter than it really is, they are a problem for economic policy makers\nas well as for frustrated job seekers. Companies should take ads down when\njobs are filled.\n\n### Design jobs with realistic requirements.\n\nFiguring out what the requirements of a job should be--and the corresponding\nattributes candidates must have--is a bigger challenge now, because so many\ncompanies have reduced the number of internal recruiters whose function, in\npart, is to push back on hiring managers' wish lists. (\"That job doesn't\nrequire 10 years of experience,\" or \"No one with all those qualifications will\nbe willing to accept the salary you're proposing to pay.\") My earlier research\nfound that companies piled on job requirements, baked them into the applicant-\ntracking software that sorted resumes according to binary decisions (yes, it\nhas the key word; no, it doesn't), and then found that virtually no applicants\nmet all the criteria. Trimming recruiters, who have expertise in hiring, and\nhanding the process over to hiring managers is a prime example of being penny-\nwise and pound-foolish.\n\n### Reconsider your focus on passive candidates.\n\nThe recruiting process begins with a search for experienced people who aren't\nlooking to move. This is based on the notion that something may be wrong with\nanyone who wants to leave his or her current job. (Of the more than 20,000\ntalent professionals who responded to a LinkedIn survey in 2015, 86% said\ntheir recruiting organizations focused \"very much so\" or \"to some extent\" on\npassive candidates; I suspect that if anything, that number has since grown.)\nRecruiters know that the vast majority of people are open to moving at the\nright price: Surveys of employees find that only about 15% are _not_ open to\nmoving. As the economist Harold Demsetz said when asked by a competing\nuniversity if he was happy working where he was: \"Make me unhappy.\"\n\nFascinating evidence from the LinkedIn survey cited above shows that although\nself-identified \"passive\" job seekers are different from \"active\" job seekers,\nit's not in the way we might think. The number one factor that would encourage\nthe former to move is more money. For active candidates the top factor is\nbetter work and career opportunities. More active than passive job seekers\nreport that they are passionate about their work, engaged in improving their\nskills, and reasonably satisfied with their current jobs. They seem interested\nin moving because they are ambitious, not because they want higher pay.\n\nEmployers spend a vastly disproportionate amount of their budgets on\nrecruiters who chase passive candidates, but on average they fill only 11% of\ntheir positions with individually targeted people, according to research by\nGerry Crispin and Chris Hoyt, of CareerXroads. I know of no evidence that\npassive candidates become better employees, let alone that the process is\ncost-effective. If you focus on passive candidates, think carefully about what\nthat actually gets you. Better yet, check your data to find out.\n\n### Understand the limits of referrals.\n\nThe most popular channel for finding new hires is through employee referrals;\nup to 48% come from them, according to LinkedIn research. It seems like a\ncheap way to go, but does it produce better hires? Many employers think so.\nIt's hard to know whether that's true, however, given that they don't check.\nAnd research by Emilio Castilla and colleagues suggests otherwise: They find\nthat when referrals work out better than other hires, it's because their\nreferrers look after them and essentially onboard them. If a referrer leaves\nbefore the new hire begins, the latter's performance is no better than that of\nnonreferrals, which is why it makes sense to pay referral bonuses six months\nor so after the person is hired--if he or she is still there.\n\nA downside to referrals, of course, is that they can lead to a homogeneous\nworkforce, because the people we know tend to be like us. This matters greatly\nfor organizations interested in diversity, since recruiting is the only avenue\nallowed under U.S. law to increase diversity in a workforce. The Supreme Court\nhas ruled that demographic criteria cannot be used even to break ties among\ncandidates.\n\n### Measure the results.\n\nFew employers know which channel produces the best candidates at the lowest\ncost because they don't track the outcomes. Tata is an exception: It has long\ndone what I advocate. For college recruiting, for example, it calculates which\nschools send it employees who perform the best, stay the longest, and are paid\nthe lowest starting wage. Other employers should follow suit and monitor\nrecruiting channels and employees' performance to identify which sources\nproduce the best results.\n\n### Persuade fewer people to apply.\n\nThe hiring industry pays a great deal of attention to \"the funnel,\" whereby\nreaders of a company's job postings become applicants, are interviewed, and\nultimately are offered jobs. Contrary to the popular belief that the U.S. job\nmarket is extremely tight right now, most jobs still get lots of applicants.\nRecruiting and hiring consultants and vendors estimate that about 2% of\napplicants receive offers. Unfortunately, the main effort to improve hiring--\nvirtually always aimed at making it faster and cheaper--has been to shovel\nmore applicants into the funnel. Employers do that primarily through\nmarketing, trying to get out the word that they are great places to work.\nWhether doing this is a misguided way of trying to attract better hires or\njust meant to make the organization feel more desirable isn't clear.\n\n## The Grass Is Always Greener\u2026\n\nOrganizations are much more interested in external talent than in their own\nemployees to fill vacancies. Here are the top channels for quality hires.  \n![R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png)\n\nMuch better to go in the other direction: Create a smaller but better-\nqualified applicant pool to improve the yield. Here's why: Every applicant\ncosts you money--especially now, in a labor market where applicants have\nstarted to \"ghost\" employers, abandoning their applications midway through the\nprocess. Every application also exposes a company to legal risk, because the\ncompany has obligations to candidates (not to discriminate, for example) just\nas it does to employees. And collecting lots of applicants in a wide funnel\nmeans that a great many of them won't fit the job or the company, so employers\nhave to rely on the next step of the hiring process--selection--to weed them\nout. As we will see, employers aren't good at that.\n\nOnce people are candidates, they may not be completely honest about their\nskills or interests--because they want to be hired--and employers' ability to\nfind out the truth is limited. More than a generation ago the psychologist\nJohn Wanous proposed giving applicants a realistic preview of what the job is\nlike. That still makes sense as a way to head off those who would end up being\nunhappy in the job. It's not surprising that Google has found a way to do this\nwith gamification: Job seekers see what the work would be like by playing a\ngame version of it. Marriott has done the same, even for low-level employees.\nIts My Marriott Hotel game targets young people in developing countries who\nmay have had little experience in hotels to show them what it's like and to\nsteer them to the recruiting site if they score well on the game. The key for\nany company, though, is that the preview should make clear what is difficult\nand challenging about the work as well as why it's fun so that candidates who\ndon't fit won't apply.\n\nIt should be easy for candidates to learn about a company and a job, but\nmaking it really easy to apply, just to fill up that funnel, doesn't make much\nsense. During the dot-com boom Texas Instruments cleverly introduced a\npreemployment test that allowed applicants to see their scores before they\napplied. If their scores weren't high enough for the company to take their\napplications seriously, they tended not to proceed, and the company saved the\ncost of having to process their applications.\n\nIf the goal is to get better hires in a cost-effective manner, it's more\nimportant to scare away candidates who don't fit than to jam more candidates\ninto the recruiting funnel.\n\n### Test candidates' standard skills.\n\nHow to determine which candidates to hire--what predicts who will be a good\nemployee--has been rigorously studied at least since World War I. The\npersonnel psychologists who investigated this have learned much about\npredicting good hires that contemporary organizations have since forgotten,\nsuch as that neither college grades nor unstructured sequential interviews\n(hopping from office to office) are a good predictor, whereas past performance\nis.\n\nSince it can be difficult (if not impossible) to glean sufficient information\nabout an outside applicant's past performance, what other predictors are good?\nThere is remarkably little consensus even among experts. That's mainly because\na typical job can have so many tasks and aspects, and different factors\npredict success at different tasks.\n\nThere is general agreement, however, that testing to see whether individuals\nhave standard skills is about the best we can do. Can the candidate speak\nFrench? Can she do simple programming tasks? And so forth. But just doing the\ntests is not enough. The economists Mitchell Hoffman, Lisa B. Kahn, and\nDanielle Li found that even when companies conduct such tests, hiring managers\noften ignore them--and when they do, they get worse hires. The psychologist\nNathan Kuncel and colleagues discovered that even when hiring managers use\nobjective criteria and tests, applying their own weights and judgment to those\ncriteria leads them to pick worse candidates than if they had used a standard\nformula. Only 40% of employers, however, do any tests of skills or general\nabilities, including IQ. What are they doing instead? Seventy-four percent do\ndrug tests, including for marijuana use; even employers in states where\nrecreational use is now legal still seem to do so.\n\n### Be wary of vendors bearing high-tech gifts.\n\nInto the testing void has come a new group of entrepreneurs who either are\ndata scientists or have them in tow. They bring a fresh approach to the hiring\nprocess--but often with little understanding of how hiring actually works.\nJohn Sumser, of HRExaminer, an online newsletter that focuses on HR\ntechnology, estimates that on average, companies get five to seven pitches\n_every day_ --almost all of them about hiring--from vendors using data science\nto address HR issues. These vendors have all sorts of cool-sounding\nassessments, such as computer games that can be scored to predict who will be\na good hire. We don't know whether any of these actually lead to better hires,\nbecause few of them are validated against actual job performance. That aside,\nthese assessments have spawned a counterwave of vendors who help candidates\nlearn how to score well on them. Lloyds Bank, for example, developed a\nvirtual-reality-based assessment of candidate potential, and JobTestPrep\noffers to teach potential candidates how to do well on it. Especially for IT\nand technical jobs, cheating on skills tests and even video interviews (where\ncolleagues off camera give help) is such a concern that eTeki and other\nspecialized vendors help employers figure out who is cheating in real time.\n\n### Revamp your interviewing process.\n\nThe amount of time employers spend on interviews has almost doubled since\n2009, according to research from Glassdoor. How much of that increase\nrepresents delays in setting up those interviews is impossible to tell, but it\nprovides at least a partial explanation for why it takes longer to fill jobs\nnow. Interviews are arguably the most difficult technique to get right,\nbecause interviewers should stick to questions that predict good hires--mainly\nabout past behavior or performance that's relevant to the tasks of the job--\nand ask them consistently across candidates. Just winging it and asking\nwhatever comes to mind is next to useless.\n\nMore important, interviews are where biases most easily show up, because\ninterviewers do usually decide on the fly what to ask of whom and how to\ninterpret the answer. Everyone knows some executive who is absolutely certain\nhe knows the one question that will really predict good candidates (\"If you\nwere stranded on a desert island\u2026\"). The sociologist Lauren Rivera's\nexamination of interviews for elite positions, such as those in professional\nservices firms, indicates that hobbies, particularly those associated with the\nrich, feature prominently as a selection criterion.\n\nInterviews are most important for assessing \"fit with our culture,\" which is\nthe number one hiring criterion employers report using, according to research\nfrom the Rockefeller Foundation. It's also one of the squishiest attributes to\nmeasure, because few organizations have an accurate and consistent view of\ntheir own culture--and even if they do, understanding what attributes\nrepresent a good fit is not straightforward. For example, does the fact that\nan applicant belonged to a fraternity reflect experience working with others\nor elitism or bad attitudes toward women? Should it be completely irrelevant?\nLetting someone with no experience or training make such calls is a recipe for\nbad hires and, of course, discriminatory behavior. Think hard about whether\nyour interviewing protocols make any sense and resist the urge to bring even\nmore managers into the interview process.\n\n### Recognize the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning models.\n\nCulture fit is another area into which new vendors are swarming. Typically\nthey collect data from current employees, create a machine learning model to\npredict the attributes of the best ones, and then use that model to hire\ncandidates with the same attributes.\n\nAs with many other things in this new industry, that sounds good until you\nthink about it; then it becomes replete with problems. Given the best\nperformers of the past, the algorithm will almost certainly include _white_\nand _male_ as key variables. If it's restricted from using that category, it\nwill come up with attributes associated with being a white male, such as\nplaying rugby.\n\nInterviews are where biases most easily show up.\n\nMachine learning models do have the potential to find important but previously\nunconsidered relationships. Psychologists, who have dominated research on\nhiring, have been keen to study attributes relevant to their interests, such\nas personality, rather than asking the broader question \"What identifies a\npotential good hire?\" Their results gloss over the fact that they often have\nonly a trivial ability to predict who will be a good performer, particularly\nwhen many factors are involved. Machine learning, in contrast, can come up\nwith highly predictive factors. Research by Evolv, a workforce analytics\npioneer (now part of Cornerstone OnDemand), found that expected commuting\ndistance for the candidate predicted turnover very well. But that's not a\nquestion the psychological models thought to ask. (And even that question has\nproblems.)\n\nThe advice on selection is straightforward: Test for skills. Ask assessments\nvendors to show evidence that they can actually predict who the good employees\nwill be. Do fewer, more-consistent interviews.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nIt's impossible to get better at hiring if you can't tell whether the\ncandidates you select become good employees. If you don't know where you're\ngoing, any road will take you there. You must have a way to measure which\nemployees are the best ones.\n\nWhy is that not getting through to companies? Surveyed employers say the main\nreason they don't examine whether their practices lead to better hires is that\nmeasuring employee performance is difficult. Surely this is a prime example of\nmaking the perfect the enemy of the good. Some aspects of performance are not\ndifficult to measure: Do employees quit? Are they absent? Virtually all\nemployers conduct performance appraisals. If you don't trust them, try\nsomething simpler. Ask supervisors, \"Do you regret hiring this individual?\nWould you hire him again?\"\n\nOrganizations that don't check to see how well their practices predict the\nquality of their hires are lacking in one of the most consequential aspects of\nmodern business.\n\n_**Editor 's Note:** A previous version of this article named three\nrecruitment process outsourcing companies, and stated that they utilized\nsubcontractors in India and the Philippines.

The newest development in hiring, which is both promising and\nworrying, is the rise of data science-driven algorithms to find and assess job\ncandidates. By my count, more than 100 vendors are creating and selling these\ntools to companies. Unfortunately, data science--which is still in its infancy\nwhen it comes to recruiting and hiring--is not yet the panacea employers hope\nfor.\n\nVendors of these new tools promise they will help reduce the role that social\nbias plays in hiring. And the algorithms can indeed help identify good job\ncandidates who would previously have been screened out for lack of a certain\neducation or social pedigree. But these tools may also identify and promote\nthe use of predictive variables that are (or should be) troubling.\n\nBecause most data scientists seem to know so little about the context of\nemployment, their tools are often worse than nothing. For instance, an\nastonishing percentage build their models by simply looking at attributes of\nthe \"best performers\" in workplaces and then identifying which job candidates\nhave the same attributes. They use anything that's easy to measure: facial\nexpressions, word choice, comments on social media, and so forth. But a\nfailure to check for any real difference between high-performing and low-\nperforming employees on these attributes limits their usefulness. Furthermore,\nscooping up data from social media or the websites people have visited also\nraises important questions about privacy. True, the information can be\naccessed legally; but the individuals who created the postings didn't intend\nor authorize them to be used for such purposes. Furthermore, is it fair that\nsomething you posted as an undergrad can end up driving your hiring algorithm\na generation later?\n\nAnother problem with machine learning approaches is that few employers collect\nthe large volumes of data--number of hires, performance appraisals, and so on\n--that the algorithms require to make accurate predictions. Although vendors\ncan theoretically overcome that hurdle by aggregating data from many\nemployers, they don't really know whether individual company contexts are so\ndistinct that predictions based on data from the many are inaccurate for the\none.\n\nYet another issue is that all analytic approaches to picking candidates are\nbackward looking, in the sense that they are based on outcomes that have\nalready happened. (Algorithms are especially reliant on past experiences in\npart because building them requires lots and lots of observations--many years'\nworth of job performance data even for a large employer.) As Amazon learned,\nthe past may be very different from the future you seek. It discovered that\nthe hiring algorithm it had been working on since 2014 gave lower scores to\nwomen--even to attributes associated with women, such as participating in\nwomen's studies programs--because historically the best performers in the\ncompany had disproportionately been men. So the algorithm looked for people\njust like them. Unable to fix that problem, the company stopped using the\nalgorithm in 2017. Nonetheless, many other companies are pressing ahead.\n\nThe underlying challenge for data scientists is that hiring is simply not like\ntrying to predict, say, when a ball bearing will fail--a question for which\nany predictive measure might do. Hiring is so consequential that it is\ngoverned not just by legal frameworks but by fundamental notions of fairness.\nThe fact that some criterion is associated with good job performance is\nnecessary but not sufficient for using it in hiring.\n\nTake a variable that data scientists have found to have predictive value:\ncommuting distance to the job. According to the data, people with longer\ncommutes suffer higher rates of attrition. However, commuting distance is\ngoverned by where you live--which is governed by housing prices, relates to\nincome, and also relates to race. Picking whom to hire on the basis of where\nthey live most likely has an adverse impact on protected groups such as racial\nminorities.\n\nUnless no other criterion predicts at least as well as the one being used--and\nthat is extremely difficult to determine in machine learning algorithms--\ncompanies violate the law if they use hiring criteria that have adverse\nimpacts. Even then, to stay on the right side of the law, they must show why\nthe criterion creates good performance. That might be possible in the case of\ncommuting time, but--at least for the moment--it is not for facial\nexpressions, social media postings, or other measures whose significance\ncompanies cannot demonstrate.\n\nIn the end, the drawback to using algorithms is that we're trying to use them\non the cheap: building them by looking only at best performers rather than all\nperformers, using only measures that are easy to gather, and relying on\nvendors' claims that the algorithms work elsewhere rather than observing the\nresults with our own employees. Not only is there no free lunch here, but you\nmight be better off skipping the cheap meal altogether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us.

Yes, it\u2019s pricey at $26.99,\nbut many email apps these days have moved to monthly subscription models,\nmaking Airmail a nice alternative to that pricing approach.\n\nIt has a great companion app, some unique features like Touch Bar support, and\na nice customizable interface that feels like the Mail app but with a much-\nneeded visual overhaul. There are plenty of other options, from Spark to\nEdison Mail to Newton, but Airmail is perhaps the most reliable of the bunch,\nand the only one geared toward consumers that lets you pay once and own it\nforever.\n\n**Airmail 3**\n\nAvailable for $26.99 from App Store\n\n[Buy now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airmail-email-client/id918858936)\n\n* * *\n\n## Alfred 4\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/l6f9863aWYN_j58NnRBvPeTJZl8=/0x0:1188x776/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:1188x776\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542035/search_2x.jpg) Image: Running with\nCrayons\n\nThe latest version of the popular Alfred search and application launcher tool,\nAlfred 4, was released back in May, and it brought a [dizzying number of major\nupgrades to the service](https://www.alfredapp.com/whats-new/).

It\u2019s\nMac-only note-taking software that has a fantastic iOS companion app and a\ngreat look and feel. It\u2019s not overstuffed with features you\u2019ll never use or\nbogged down by its creator\u2019s desire to break into the enterprise.\n\nIt has simple features, like note pinning and markdown support, and an elegant\nthree-column layout that lets you move between your organized hashtags, note\nlist, and the actual editor itself. It costs $20 a year for the premium\nversion to get access to cross-device syncing, but it\u2019s worth it in my\nopinion.

But for Mac users, window management is kind of a nightmare\nand always has been. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a robust third-party ecosystem for\nhelping you get the window snapping and organizational features you find\nnatively on Microsoft\u2019s OS. One of the best apps for doing this is\n[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/), which lets you snap windows flush to\nthe edges of your screen and into preconfigured layouts that you can save\nacross apps. There\u2019s support for keyboard shortcuts as well, making Magnet, at\njust $2, a must-have tool for the more organizationally-minded Mac users out\nthere.\n\n**Magnet**\n\nAvailable for $1.99 from the App Store\n\n[Buy now](https://apps.apple.com/app/id441258766)\n\n* * *\n\n## Todoist\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/I7vWeeYNxMvXshUkzt_aul_3p44=/0x0:2048x1410/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2048x1410\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19542106/Themes_2x.png) Image: Todoist\n\nLike email, calendar, and note-taking apps, personal task-tracking software is\nsomething a Mac comes with out of the box.

Although Wavebox costs $20 a year to unlock some of its better features,\nit works well enough in its free, base version, and it has powerful\nnotification and menu bar controls.

Rating concept.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1165702441/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGetty\n\nThe latest statistics on employee engagement should grab the attention of all\ntypes of sizes of organizations. Eighty-four percent of workers are merely\n\u201ccoming to work\u201d and are not contributing fully to their organizations (Hayes,\nChumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019). This is just one of the eye-opening\ninsights from [ADP Research Institute\u2019s new Global Study of\nEngagement](https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-\ninsights/articles/g/global-study-of-engagement-technical-report.aspx), the\nmost definitive global study on engagement yet. One would have thought that\nthe [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.tlnt.com/weekly-\nwrap-720-million-spent-on-engagement-and-this-is-all-we-get/) being spent by\ncompanies on improving engagement would be having an effect, but the data is\nclear \u2013 the impact is minimal and in some countries, including the United\nStates, engagement is dropping, not climbing (Hayes, Chumney, Wright &\nBuckingham, 2019). The authors of ADP Research Institute\u2019s study say its time\nto address engagement in new ways, and I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n**The Two Keys to Engagement**\n\nOrganizations and their HR teams have been working tirelessly to improve\nengagement for almost[ 30\nyears](https://www.hrzone.com/engage/employees/history-of-employee-engagement-\nfrom-satisfaction-to-sustainability), ever since [\u201cFrom People to Profits, the\nHR link to the service-profit chain](https://www.employment-\nstudies.co.uk/resource/people-profits)\u201d was published by the Institute of\nEmployment Studies (IES) in 1990. For those tasked with improving engagement\nit must feel like running on a hamster wheel given that efforts are producing\nlittle to no impact. Remember that well worn but still applicable Einstein\nquote? \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the something over and over and\nexpecting a different result.\u201d\n\nThe good news is, when efforts are focused on the right areas, engagement will\nrise; we just haven\u2019t been focusing on the right areas. ADP Research\nInstitute\u2019s latest research shows that getting the most from your employees\ncomes down to two things: teams and trust (Hayes, Chumney, Wright &\nBuckingham, 2019).  After surveying over 19,000 workers across the globe, the\nstudy found that teams and trust in team leaders are the most important\ninfluences on employee engagement (Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019).\n\n### **The Future of Work is Teamwork**\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n> When organizations make great teams their primary focus \u2013 including what\n> creates them and what can fracture them \u2013 we expect to see more significant\n> rises in Global Engagement.\n>\n> Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019\n\nAccording to [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/teamwork), 90% of companies\nreport they are working on projects so complex that only teams of people\nworking collaboratively together will be able to solve them. Luckily, being on\na team is the single most important factor to engagement, in fact, when an\nindividual is on a team, they are 2-3 times more likely to be fully engaged\nthan those who are not (Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019).\n\nSo why haven\u2019t we moved the needle on engagement? Because we haven\u2019t been\nfocusing our efforts on where the work is being done within the myriad of\nteams that actually do the work across the organization. Gone are the days of\nwork being done in silos only by those teams that show up on an organizational\nchart. Teams are more fluid and dynamic than ever; work gets done in cross-\nfunctional project teams and committees which makes it difficult for HR to\nhave a line of site to the teams doing the work, let alone being able to\n[effectively measure](https://teamfitnesstool.com/7-elements/) and support\ntheir effectiveness. I suppose then that it is shocking but not surprising\nthat ADP Research Institute\u2019s study finds that organizations don\u2019t understand\nor act on the vital power of teams (Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham,\n2019).\n\n> Organizations must be able to see, support, and measure teamwork.\n>\n> Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019\n\nI am often asked, \u201chow do you define a team?\u201d and I respond with, \u201ca team is a\ngroup of people with a common goal who depend upon one another to achieve that\ngoal.\u201d This definition can apply to any group of people coming together to get\nwork done or to provide service to stakeholders. Unfortunately, when HR\nconsiders team and leadership development initiatives they are too often\nfocused on those traditional intact teams and overlook the cross-functional\nand dynamic teams that come together for a period of time. And yet we know\nthat [75% of cross-functional teams](https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-\nfunctional-teams-are-dysfunctional) are dysfunctional. It is no wonder\nemployee engagement isn\u2019t rising.\n\n### So, what is an organization to do?\n\n1.      Know where the work is happening.\n\nIn my conversation with [Marcus\nBuckingham](https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/adp-research-\ninstitute/about-the-institute/marcus-buckingham.aspx), ADP Research\nInstitute\u2019s Head of Research, People and Performance who led the study, he\nshared that organizations must stop relying solely on traditional HR Talent\nManagement systems and must begin to leverage existing team productivity tools\nto better understand where the work is being done. Tools like\n[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/) and\n[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=1t1&adgroup=59152536674&campaign=1440801501&creative=340023130690&device=c&keyword=jira&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p34163685171&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy43jnce-5AIVCZSzCh2FJwngEAAYASAAEgJyGfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\nare examples of tools used by teams to do great work and provide organizations\nwith insight into who is doing what work together and for what purpose.\n\n2.      Arm your leaders with the right tools to:\n\n_Develop their own teams._\n\nIf you are relying solely on HR and OD to develop great teams, your\norganization will fall behind on improving engagement and performance.\nOrganizations that thrive today are made up of nimble, high performing teams.\nTo become and remain high performing, teams require real-time data about their\nteam effectiveness so that they can quickly shift their actions and behaviors\nin a productive direction. For this to happen, leaders must have a set of\ntools to measure and support their team\u2019s effectiveness. Effective tools\ndefine what [exceptional teamwork looks\nlike](https://teamfitnesstool.com/ebook/?utm_source=Forbes&utm_medium=PR&utm_campaign=20190906a14)\nand provide simple and easy ways to measure team effectiveness and support the\nleader in enabling the action and dialogue required to move the team forward.\nThe ability to tap into the vital power of teams must be placed into the hands\nof the leader and their team - no matter the type of team.\n\n_Build trust._\n\nA worker is 12 times more likely to be fully engaged if they trust their team\nleader (Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019). Specifically, when an\nindividual knows their role and knows that their contributions and strengths\nare being used and valued, they will have [greater trust for their\nleader](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolebendaly/2019/04/22/want-happier-\nemployees-four-things-leaders-can-do/#4a792a55e2b1) and will be more engaged _\n_ (Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019).\n\nLeaders then require simple tools to create conversations with their team\nmembers that create meaningful connections to the organization\u2019s mission,\nvision and purpose, that clarify expectations, and that lead to a better\nappreciation for and utilization of each individual\u2019s strengths. These tools\ncan be as simple as questions to ask during weekly check-ins \u2013 taking no more\nthan 15 minutes a week will have a significant impact on trust and engagement.\nTry this simple [set of questions](https://teamfitnesstool.com/landing-\npage-3/?utm_source=Forbes&utm_medium=PR&utm_campaign=20190906a14) with your\nteam members at your next check-in.\n\n3.      Shift your focus.\n\nIs it time for a serious conversation about employee engagement in your\norganization? Is it time to get the right stakeholders together to shine a\nlight on the real impact your employee engagement strategies are having? If\nso, start by asking and honestly answering these questions:\n\n\u00b7        Are our employee engagement strategies making enough of a difference?\n\n\u00b7        What should we be doing differently?\n\n\u00b7        How can we better focus on building great teams that do great work?\n\nThese are not necessarily easy questions to ask and answer as they require\nchallenging the status quo. But they are critical questions that must be asked\nif organizations truly want to improve engagement and enable their people to\ndo great work.\n\nInstead of an organizational world in which 84% of workers are merely coming\nto work, imagine one in which 84% of workers were enthusiastically engaged.\nLet this [study](https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-\ninsights/articles/g/global-study-of-engagement-technical-report.aspx) serve as\na wake-up call for us to focus on developing teams and trust in every corner\nof our organizations.\n\n  \n\n_My free e-book for tapping the best of your teams can be found_[\n_here_](https://teamfitnesstool.com/ebook/?utm_source=Forbes&utm_medium=PR&utm_campaign=20190906a14)\n_.

Know](/-/media/images/workforce-blog-images/a-beginners-guide-\nto-training-needs-analysis--what-landd-leaders-need-to-\nknow.png?modified=20191022201641&la=en)\n\n**Idea in brief:  \nA training needs analysis helps L&D leaders identify the skills that most\nimpact the company mission, the skills gaps in their company, the current\nprograms that are working and the new programs that need to be developed.**\n\nBusiness leaders understand that learning and development (L&D) and training\nprograms are critical to the future success of their companies. But which\nprograms is less clear.\n\nFor example, according to McKinsey & Company's [Building Capabilities for\nPerformance Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/organization/our-insights/building-capabilities-for-performance),\n49% of executives ranked increasing organizational capabilities as a primary\nstrategic goal. But:\n\n  * Almost half (48%) said these efforts were hindered by a lack of a clear vision.\n  * 36% said they lacked credible metrics.\n  * The most commonly cited measurement is manager feedback.\n  * Only 13% calculate the ROI of their learning investments.\n\nOrganizations can bridge the knowledge gap in their L&D programs by conducting\na training needs analysis, also called a training needs assessment. The\nMcKinsey report touched briefly on this idea, citing three broad goals of a\nskills assessment:\n\n  * Identify the skills that have the greatest impact on corporate performance.\n  * Address individual employee needs.\n  * Align learning goals with corporate mission.\n\nBelow is a beginners' guide, answering basic questions about what a training\nneeds analysis is, its benefits, and how to conduct one.\n\n### What is a training needs analysis?\n\nA training needs analysis is a comparison of the current skills and\ncompetencies inside an organization against the skills required for the\ncompany to succeed. The goal of a training needs analysis is to identify gaps\nin the skillset of the current workforce.\n\nAn effective training needs analysis should account for the organization's\noverall business goals and strategy. It should assess what skills are needed\ntoward a particular end, which is unique to the company.\n\nFor example, Company A might have a strategy built on high volume and low\nmargins while Company B has a strategy built on luxury branding and high\nmargins. Though they are in the same industry, each company will need\ndifferent skills in its workforce.\n\n### Why do a training needs analysis?\n\nThere are several possible benefits to a training needs analysis:\n\n**1\\. Inform the company 's learning and development agenda.**\n\nIt should uncover where the company needs to improve and where more training\nis needed. For example, a company preparing for a future with more automated\ncustomer service may consider training programs to [ensure customer service\nrepresentatives have the skills to handle more complex customer\nsituations](https://collegeforamerica.org/customer-service-automation-\nrequires-better-training/).\n\n**2\\. Save money and improve revenue.**\n\nIt should identify workforce issues that will let a company streamline\noperations, [improve employee engagement](/about-us/newsroom/2019/05/snhu-\ndesigns-for-employee-engagement) and grow the bottom line.\n\n**3\\. Re-organize L &D programs.**\n\nA training needs analysis also helps save direct costs and time on L&D\nprograms by sorting out genuine priorities from training \"wishes.\"\n\n**4\\. Make L &D more effective.**\n\nA training needs analysis can improve the effectiveness of L&D investments. It\ncan determine which employees actually need training and reveal where current\ntraining activities may not be necessary.\n\nLastly, a training needs analysis can show where training may not be the right\nsolution. Sometimes a perceived skills gap may be addressed better by informal\ncoaching, job shadowing or mentoring.\n\n### How is a training needs assessment conducted?\n\nA training needs assessment usually involves seven sources of information:\n\n**1\\. Interviews.**\n\nOne-on-one interviews with employees, frontline managers and customers\nhighlight performance gaps.\n\n**2\\. Surveys.**\n\nSurveys, questionnaires and polls solicit feedback from employees and managers\nabout the skills they would like to enhance.\n\n**3\\. Focus groups.**\n\nSupplementing individual interviews, a focus group brings together a\ndepartment to brainstorm and prioritize their training needs list.\n\n**4\\. Observations.**\n\nHaving managers directly observe how employees perform their tasks gives a\npeek into areas for improvement. Beyond direct observations, managers can\nreview an employee's work output and yearly evaluations.\n\n**5\\. Learning data.**\n\nIf an organization already has online learning programs, reviewing results\nshould provide insight about the current skills of the workforce and what\nneeds still exist.\n\n**6\\. Performance data.**\n\nMeasurable results on the metrics that matter for your workforce (for example,\ncustomer conversions, customer retention or employee retention) should\nhighlight where more skills training is needed.\n\n**7\\. Industry trends.**\n\nA scan of data, trend reports and thought leadership from competitors and\nindustry groups can help identify future skills needs.\n\nOne possible tool for a training needs analysis is a SWOT chart identifying\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Tools like these should\nenable the company to identify gaps in the skill sets of the workforce that\ncan prevent it from reaching its business goals.\n\n### How does a company identify training needs?\n\nA training needs analysis will uncover many shortfalls in knowledge and\nskills. The company then has to decide which are truly important and the\ntarget of its training program. L&D leaders should consider questions such as:\n\n  * Will improving this skill help us achieve an organizational goal?\n  * Is training the right solution to this skills gap?\n  * Which employees need this training?\n\n### How does a company calculate the cost of training?\n\nA training needs analysis should also include costs. The formula for the\nprojected cost of training is simple: the number of employees to be trained\nmultiplied by the average expense of the training. The difficulty is\nestimating the average expense.\n\nA training budget can draw from two main sources for estimates:\n\n  * Industry averages. For example, it may be the rule of thumb in your industry to budget 2% of salary per employee per year for L&D.\n  * Price it out. If you know what initiatives or programs you need, you can begin gathering cost estimates from vendors.\n\n### How does a company deliver training?\n\nWhile a company performs a training needs assessment, it will take an in-depth\nlook at its current training programs to determine if changes are needed.\nThese questions clarify how a training program is delivered:\n\n  * What training materials and content is available now?\n  * Does the organization have the subject-matter experts on staff to handle the training or should it partner with an outside organization such as a university?\n  * What are the learning styles of the employees?\n  * Should the learning be delivered in person or online?\n\nOnce those questions are answered, an organization has a blueprint for its\ntraining delivery methods.\n\n### How do organizations measure the results of a training program?\n\nMeasuring the ultimate outcome of a training program after implementation\ndepends on what the organization aims to accomplish. Soft skills improvement\ncan show up in better customer satisfaction scores, for example. Well-trained\nemployees will remain with the company, thereby boosting retention.\n\nOne model for measuring the results of a training program is to first\nestablish SMART goals:\n\n  * Specific\n  * Measurable\n  * Achievable\n  * Realistic\n  * Time-based\n\nOnce you are clear on the goals, you can look for indicators of progress.\nMetrics that reveal the results of a training program can be found in:\n\n  * Learner satisfaction surveys\n  * Number of certifications earned\n  * Number of degrees earned\n  * Test results in courses\n  * Performance evaluations\n\nThose are relatively short-term indicators. The long-term indicator is how the\nbusiness grows.\n\nAgain, the purpose of measuring your training program is to ensure alignment\nwith the ultimate strategy and goals of the business. It doesn't do any good\nto successfully train large numbers of employees on a skill that doesn't\nimprove business results.\n\n[Contact the Workforce Partnerships team](https://www.snhu.edu/about-\nus/partnerships/become-a-partner) at Southern New Hampshire University to\nlearn about our tailored learning solutions.\n\n[Workforce Development](/about-us/newsroom/categories/workforce-development)\n\n### Explore more content like this article\n\n![Lisa Urban, phd, msn, rn, associate chief nursing\nadministrator](/-/media/images/blog-image/lisa-\nurban.png?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200319171853&hash=134D40BB4492C51BA0B046F3E8C1FD8B120CD823)\n\n[\n\n##  The Nursing Workforce of the Future\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/04/the-nursing-workforce-of-the-future)\n\nApril 02, 2020\n\n  \n\nAn interview with Associate Chief Nursing Administrator Lisa Urban at SNHU\nabout how higher education and employers work together to build the nursing\nworkforce.\n\n![A nurse educator overlooking the work of another\nnurse.](/-/media/images/blog-image/nursing-\nshortage.jpg?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200305151647&hash=4B7CD2497CA59BBCB5CC4C1BBF8A37ACA122709A)\n\n[\n\n##  How the Nurse Educator Shortage Is Holding Back Healthcare\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/03/how-the-nurse-educator-shortage-is-holding-back-\nhealthcare)\n\nMarch 05, 2020\n\n  \n\nSeveral indicators point to a shortage in nurse educators but what are the\nimplications for the future of the healthcare workforce?\n\n![man touching a computer screen that is displaying medical\ninformation](/-/media/images/blog-image/nursing-\ntechnology-440x440.jpg?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200227153352&hash=958375E94F842477F043B32B5976678335CC1FE6)\n\n[\n\n##  What Healthcare Professionals Need to Know About AI in 2020\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/02/what-healthcare-professionals-need-to-know-about-\nai-in-2020)\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n\n  \n\nTo prepare for the coming revolution, healthcare professionals need to\nunderstand the new benefits, risks and challenges of AI.

The mayor said no one is being replaced, adding Deputy Chief\nBobby Stewart will remain chief of operations and Deputy Chief Eric Paymon\nwill remain over the department's administration.\n\nFlaggs plans to offer the deputy chief of patrol position to Capt. Penny\nJones, the present patrol division commander.\n\nFlaggs said he prepared the reorganization of the department on his own\nwithout outside assistance and without consulting Aldermen Michael Mayfield\nand Alex Monsour or Police Chief Milton Moore.\n\nHe said Mayfield and Monsour received copies of the plan Wednesday and were\nexpected to vote on the proposed restructuring during Friday\u2019s meeting of the\nBoard of Mayor and Aldermen.\n\n\u201cI told him I didn\u2019t want to include him because I didn\u2019t want the public and\nI didn\u2019t want his colleagues thinking he made these changes,\" Flaggs said as\nto why he did not include Moore in developing the new structure. \"I made\nthem.\u201d\n\nFlaggs said he briefed Moore on the new organizational chart Wednesday morning\nand that Moore appeared receptive to the plan. \u201cHe\u2019s taking time to digest\nit,\" Flaggs said.\n\n\u201cI told the chief this is no indictment on what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Flaggs said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s providing us with leadership. We\u2019re providing him another tool and\nreinforcing his ability to serve the citizens of Vicksburg. One crime in\nVicksburg is too many.\n\n\u201cThis does not diminish any authority or responsibility of the police chief;\nthis gives him reinforcement.\"\n\nFlaggs said the chart was the result of six years\u2019 experience working with the\npublic and the police department, and a review of the present organizational\nchart \u201cafter some sleepless nights.\u201d\n\nThe influence, he said, was a series of events occurring Sept. 21 and 22 when\none man was shot and killed on Fayette Street and two teenagers were shot and\nwounded in a fight on North Frontage Road between the Ivy Place and Vicksburg\nFord.\n\n\u201cWe had one homicide and we had some shooting, and you would have thought we\nhad a riot in Vicksburg the way it was perceived,\u201d Flaggs said. \u201cWhy? Because\nthere was not any collaboration or communication of what happened.\u201d\n\nThe present organizational chart, he said, \u201cDoes not function; there are too\nmany places where you cannot find information. It looks like it flows down\nfrom the mayor and police commissioner to the chief, but it goes all over the\nplace.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's speech at the Vicksburg Warren Chamber of Commerce\nluncheon, Flaggs admitted he was among city leaders who approved the current\nstructure. \"I voted for it,\" Flaggs said, looking at the current\norganizational chart, \"and I still don't know what I am looking at.\"\n\nThe new chart, Flaggs said, assigns specific responsibilities to the deputy\nchiefs and makes the department more accessible to the public by identifying\nthe proper person someone can contact for information about a wreck or a\ntraffic ticket.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be able to hold the deputy chiefs, the police chief responsible\nfor that,\" he said. \u201cI want every person in this city to have access to any\ninformation that is available to the public.\u201d The exclusion, he said, is\ninformation about ongoing investigations.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \u201cWe want a police chart that will be more\nresponsible inside and functional so everyone is on the same page.\n\n\u201cThis, in my opinion, is more functional, and it\u2019s more accountable\ninternally,\u201d Flaggs said. \u201cAnd if Mayfield and Monsour go with me on Friday,\nwe\u2019re going to approve it.\u201d\n\nYou Might Like\n\n[ ![](https://www.vicksburgpost.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/16/2019/10/web101819-AllWAySTop-CW.jpg?w=90&h=90&crop=1)\n](https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2019/10/23/accident-in-busy-intersection-\nturns-out-to-have-a-silver-lining/)\n\n####  [Accident in busy intersection turns out to have a silver\nlining](https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2019/10/23/accident-in-busy-\nintersection-turns-out-to-have-a-silver-lining/)\n\nWho would have thought an 18-wheeler clipping power lines and tearing down\ntraffic signals at an intersection would have been...

They know\ntheir strategies, organizational capabilities, resources, and management\nsystems should all be arranged to support the enterprise\u2019s purpose. The\nchallenge is that executives tend to focus on one of these areas to the\nexclusion of the others, but what really matters for performance is how they\nall fit together.\n\nConsider McDonald\u2019s. What does it take to be able to serve over 1% of the\nworld\u2019s population \u2014 more than 70 million customers \u2014 every day and in\nvirtually every country across the world? Fanatical attention to the design\nand management of scalable processes, routines, and a working culture by which\nsimple, stand-alone, and standardized products are sold globally at a\npredictable, and therefore manageable, volume, quality, and cost. Maximizing\neconomies of scale lies at the heart of McDonald\u2019s product-centric business\nmodel. Efficiency is built into the design of its winning organization in the\nform of formalized hierarchies of performance accountability, a high division\nof labor, routinization of specialist tasks, and teamwork at the point of\nsale. McDonald\u2019s has been the market leader in its sector for decades.\n\nThis is what enterprise alignment looks like. It means winning through a\ntightly managed enterprise value chain that connects an enterprise\u2019s _purpose_\n(what we do and why we do it) to its _business strategy_ (what we are trying\nto win at to fulfill our purpose), _organizational capability_ (what we need\nto be good at to win), _resource architecture_ (what makes us good), and,\nfinally, _management systems_ (what delivers the winning performance we need).\nThe enterprise value chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n![W160125_TREVOR_INTERDEPENDENTCOMPONENTS\n\\(1\\)](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/01/W160125_TREVOR_INTERDEPENDENTCOMPONENTS-1.png)\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions, ideally with your team. You might ask them\nabout the enterprise overall, or about a single strategically important\nbusiness line, activity or function.\n\n**Enterprise purpose: What do we do and why do we do it?  **Purpose is the\nloadstone upon which every enterprise is built. Financial success is the\nconsequence of commercial enterprises fulfilling their purposes well, but it\nis not to be confused with enterprise purpose itself. Profit, for example, is\nrarely a positive focus for people\u2019s effort.\n\nConsider your own case: What is the enduring purpose of your enterprise? Why\nwould it matter if you went out of business tomorrow, and who would care? Is\nyour purpose clear enough that your investors, employees, partners, and\ncustomers could articulate it?\n\n**Business strategy: What are we trying to win at to fulfill our purpose?\n**If purpose is what the enterprise exists to achieve and why it matters, then\nbusiness strategy is planning for what the enterprise must win at to fulfill\nits purpose. Unlike its purpose, an enterprise\u2019s strategy should flex and\nmorph in response to future opportunities and threats. The degree to which\nyour enterprise\u2019s business strategy fulfills its purpose is the measure of its\neffectiveness.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company\u2019s\n[purpose](https://disneyinstitute.com/blog/2012/09/common-purpose-how-to-\ninspire-your-staff/100/) is to \u201ccreate happiness by providing the finest in\nentertainment for people of all ages, everywhere.\u201d  _How_ Disney creates\nhappiness is by offering a range of consumer products (Disney Store,\npublishing, licensing), entertainment (Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel),\nand experiences (parks and resorts). It wins by pursuing high performance in\neach area and by using each to support the others.\n\nConsider the following strategic questions for your own enterprise: What are\nyour offerings to customers, in the form of products and services, and are\nthey consistent with your purpose? What\u2019s missing? What do you do or offer\nthat you shouldn\u2019t? Who are your customers, and what are they demanding of the\nproducts and services you offer, now and in the future? Who are your\ncompetitors, and what are they capable of offering that you aren\u2019t? How do you\nneed to be different to compete and win?\n\n**Organizational  capability: What do we need to be good at to win? **Business\nstrategy receives the lion\u2019s share of executives\u2019 attention, but even the best\nstrategy is useless unless supported by appropriate organizational\ncapabilities. It is a reckless leadership team that commits to a business\nstrategy without knowing whether they can achieve it. Traditionally,\nbusinesses competed on their ability to execute their planned strategies for\nmatching supply to demand as efficiently as possible. Many enterprises will\ncontinue to operate this way in future, but additional capabilities are\nincreasingly important: the strategic value of organizational capabilities\nsuch as agility (around the customer), connectivity (between complementary\nofferings), and innovativeness (to explore novel opportunities).\n\nConsider your own organizational capabilities: What do you need to be really\ngood at to successfully achieve your winning strategy? What are you capable of\norganizationally that your rivals are not? How do you become uniquely capable\nof fulfilling what markets and customers are demanding of you, now and in the\nfuture?\n\n**Resource architecture: What makes us good? (And how good are we?)\n**Strategically aligned enterprises are made capable by their organizational\nresources, including people, structures, cultures, and work processes, and by\nthe degree to which they are [configured to be strategically\nvaluable](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Design-Power-Organizational-\nArchitecture/dp/0195099176).  _People_ reflect the value of skills,\nexperience, and knowledge required to perform the enterprise\u2019s work;\n_structure_ reflects the value of formal and informal relationships, networks,\nand functional connections through which work is structured; _processes_\nreflect the value of planned and ad hoc work processes and routines through\nwhich work is performed, and in which valuable knowledge is retained\n[organizationally](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259373?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents);\nand  _culture_ reflects the values, beliefs, and attitudes [that guide\neveryday working\nbehavior](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118047052.html).\n\nConsider your own resources: What type of people are core to you being\nsuperior at the things you need to be good at to win? What type of culture\nmight support collaboration between complementary lines of business, if your\nbusiness strategy depends upon it? What types of work processes are critical\nto your ability for inventiveness? What type of structure will enable you to\nbe agile enough to compete for and win fickle customers repeatedly?\n\n**Management  systems: What delivers the winning performance we need?\n**Management systems include all aspects of management infrastructure,\noperations, and tactics, from information systems to employee performance\nmanagement. What management practices, systems, and technologies best fit your\nwinning strategy for fulfilling your enterprise\u2019s purpose? What are\nappropriate measures of success, both short and long term? Where is the focus\nof effort and attention managerially in your enterprise, and is it aligned to\nhow you plan to win?\n\n### **Four Reasons for Misaligned Enterprises**\n\nSo far, so straightforward. So why do many businesses go off the rails? Of\nmany factors, there are four main reasons for misaligned enterprises:\n\n  * **Enterprise leaders are unaware of the risks of misalignment.**  Many senior executives we talk to do not think of their enterprises as connected and coherent value chains. Their primary focus is all too often on their enterprise\u2019s structure as articulated by the org chart. The main operating units described there are seen as being the primary components of \u201cvalue.\u201d Alignment thinking requires _all_ decision makers to view their enterprise as a value chain, not merely a set of more or less valuable boxes and wires on an easy-to-forget, ever-changing chart. What are the typical alignment debates in your enterprise? How often you have them, and with whom, relates to our second reason for misaligned enterprise.\n  * **Nobody \u201cowns\u201d enterprise alignment.**  Generally, no individual or group is functionally responsible for overseeing the arrangement of the enterprise from end to end. Multiple individuals and groups are responsible for different components of the enterprise value chain, and usually they are not as joined up as they should be. All too often individual leaders seek to protect and optimize their own domains and components, rather than align and improve across the entire enterprise. Who is responsible for ensuring your enterprise is as strategically aligned as it should be? The answer cannot be \u201cnobody\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Neither can the answer be \u201cthe CEO\u201d (or equivalent). Modern enterprises are too complex for their design and management to be left to chance or to rely solely on the wisdom of one individual.\n  * **Complexity makes enterprise alignment that much harder.**  Achieving and sustaining high enterprise alignment is hard, especially in a rapidly changing operating environment. Complexity usually arises as the result of four primary factors: number of employees, variety of business lines, variety and expectations of differing customer groups, and geographical dispersal. Large, diversified, and geographically dispersed enterprises, in whichever sectors they compete, require the greatest amount of strategic effort by their leadership to be aligned. How complex is your enterprise, and how well-equipped is your leadership team to beat the alignment challenge?\n  * **Activity is mistaken for  progress.** The killer questions outlined in the previous section require sound judgment, courage, time, and energy to answer. The frantic activity of business as usual can get in the way of the in-depth discussions and tough choices that need to take place regularly to lead a strategically aligned enterprise (and maintain it). Ensuring that the whole of the enterprise is as aligned as possible  _should_ be business as usual for enterprise leaders. Without an idealized vision and understanding of their best selves, many enterprises lack the direction, scale of ambition, or impetus required to fulfill their potential.\n\nIn summary, strategically aligned enterprises have a much better chance of\nwinning in today\u2019s challenging business environment. To win, enterprise\nleaders must find their own distinctive approach to aligning their business\nstrategies, organizational capabilities, valuable resources, and management\nsystems to fulfill their enterprise\u2019s purpose. However, when confronted by the\nscale of their enterprise alignment challenge, we believe many leaders balk at\nthe opportunity for positive but difficult change because of the unrelenting\npressure for short-term results. The penalty is unsustainable performance and\nan uncertain future.\n\n* * *\n\n[Jonathan Trevor](/search?term=jonathan%20trevor&search_type=search-all) is\nAssociate Professor of Management Practice at Oxford University's Said\nBusiness School.\n\n* * *\n\n[Barry Varcoe](/search?term=barry%20varcoe&search_type=search-all) is an\nAssociate Fellow at Oxford University's Said Business School.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [STRATEGY](/topic/strategy)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

Thankfully, there are several tools available today that can help you\nget started.\n\n _Related Article:_[ From Zero to Five Stars: Online Reputation Management\n101](http://www.business.com/online-marketing/from-zero-to-five-stars-online-\nreputation-management-101/)\n\n##  _Defining Roles Through Organizational Charts_\n\nNo organization ever grows without leaders. This is, by a mile, the most\nimportant early decisions for a startup. The best way to accomplish this is to\nuse an organizational chart to plan visually and represent your management\nstructure. It is also ideal to work with interactive [organizational chart\nsoftware](http://creately.com/Draw-Organizational-Charts-Online) to quickly\nmake adjustments whenever necessary.\n\n![Creately Screenshot](/images/content/570/8b7203087b15a7c13e900/700-386-)\n\nA web-based tool such as Creately can help you architect your organizational\nstructure on the fly. You do not need to register for an account or download\nthe app. Instead, you can start editing immediately and take advantage of its\nstyling features to quickly identify positions.\n\nYou can use some different shapes and visual elements to develop the\norganization's hierarchy. This includes arrows, people shapes, balloons, and\nlines. You could also import your images for a more personalized chart. Just\nremember that you need to sign up if you want to save your chart, but you are\nstill free to access all the tool's features.\n\nOnce you have your organizational structure chart, you now have the bare bones\nof a reliable company that's built to stand the test of time. The next step is\nto focus on the more technical details \u2013 starting with your business\nprocedures.\n\n##  _Document Operating Procedures_\n\nA growing business must establish systemised processes to help employees\nbecome more productive with their time. Without this, it will be difficult to\nidentify critical tasks and monitor their completion, especially for a growing\ncompany with growing objectives. It also helps establish uniformity and a\nstandard when it comes to output quality.\n\nA startup can manually develop the documentation themselves. However, you need\na more scalable solution that covers your business for the long-term. You can\ntake advantage of a [documentation tool](http://www.sweetprocess.com/) such as\nSweetProcess, which can help you document repetitive tasks, establish a set\nprocedure, and share them within your organization.\n\n _Related Article:_[Break Free from Performance Management Shackles: Companies\nThat Are Paving the Way](http://www.business.com/management/performance-\nmanagement-companies-that-are-breaking-free/)\n\n![SweetProcess screenshot](/images/content/570/8b7543187b13b75ad94cc/700-346-)\n\nSystemizing operating procedures are also crucial for companies with an\nexpanding workforce. Through procedure documentation, you can significantly\nreduce the time it takes to train new employees since the processes are\nalready well-documented and refined.\n\nNow that you have an organisational chart and systemised operating procedures,\nit is time to establish the teams responsible for the essential business\nprocesses.\n\n##  _Distribute Work, Delegate Tasks_\n\nA startup often struggles when it comes to monitoring every single member,\nespecially with growing teams. A well-documented procedure is meaningless if\nyou cannot identify the most qualified people to get things going.\n\nThis is why you should establish a system for managing your teams, delegating\nindividual tasks, and monitoring the progress of every member.\n\nHowever, it is not always easy to manage a team, especially if there are\nremote workers involved. This is now a common problem since outsourcing\nfreelancers are slowly becoming the norm for digital startups.\n\nTo overcome this issue, you can leverage a comprehensive [project management\nplatform](https://www.wrike.com/) such as Wrike to distribute work and\ndelegate tasks more efficiently. This is extremely helpful if you are managing\nin-house employees, remote workers, or both.\n\n![Wrike screenshot](/images/content/570/8b7d23287b1ad7a3abc15/700-350-)\n\nA project management platform functions as a paperless workspace for a\ncompany. It facilitates collaboration, idea sharing, document sharing, and\ntask delegation across teams. A platform like Wrike also helps maintain the\nproductivity of your workforce with traditional management tools such as\ntimelines and Gantt charts. This is the catalyst that integrates productivity\nto your organisational structure.\n\nWith these three components checked (organisational chart, documentation, and\nproject/team management), your startup is off to an excellent start. You now\nhave all the pieces needed to start getting results. Now, you need to answer\none last question: can you keep growing?\n\n##  _Embrace Growth_\n\nAfter finally gaining traction and seeing progress, the final challenge\nstartups must overcome to keep up with the momentum and set bigger goals.

One box for the CEO,\nsome lines to all the CEOs' direct reports, more from each person to her\ndirect reports, and so on, until every person was duly\u2026 boxed.\n\nThe problem is, reality makes a mess of that. We did one of those leadership\nretreats at my old company (what were we retreating from, exactly?). We all\nstood on the floor where our org chart had been drawn out -- each in our box.\nThen, we each took a ball of yarn and threw it to a person upon whom we\ndepended to do our jobs, who then threw it to another person. By the end, it\nwas spaghetti.\n\nThe org chart, today, struggles to show how work actually gets done.\n\nTo solve that, we started inventing workarounds: status report meetings, task\nforces, dual reporting, matrix reporting (one person for this, another for\nthat) and all manner of pointy-haired boss sleight of hand. The org chart\nitself was, of course, in a constant state of change (despite our myth that\nthere are \u201cre-orgs\u201d that change it, it\u2019s more like the re-org is constant and\nstasis is the exception). We pretend the org chart is fixed -- it\u2019s the\nultimate insult to an agile organization.\n\nWhat if we turned it around . What if, instead of having an org chart to map\nthe work to the people, we made a \u201cwork chart\u201d to map the people to the work?\nThere could be clarity of responsibility over the different things a company\ndoes, because it would be easier to show people playing different roles on\ndifferent areas of work -- as they actually do. (When it comes to security\npolicy, the CISO often trumps the CEO.)\n\nEnter new forms of organization built this way, \u201cwork chart, not org chart\u201d --\nmost famously, Holacracy, now going live at Zappos, and Dev Bootcamp, in\nproduction at Medium and many other companies.\n\nAt [Bloomberg Beta](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftiny.cc%2Fmanual),\nwe invest in making business work better, so we figured we better get over\nchuckling every time we said \u201cHolacracy\u201d out loud and actually understand this\nthing. So we did a couple of days of official Holacracy training. It was worth\nit. We saw a system with deep insights (put the work first and leave the\n\u201creporting\u201d at the door!), busted myths (it is a deeply hierarchical system,\njust a different hierarchy, of work not of people) and learned inscrutable\nrules. (I dare you to read the [Holacracy\nConstitution](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holacracy.org%2Fconstitution),\nalready in version 4.1.)\n\nWith all its forced conventions for describing things, one way to see\nHolacracy is as a protocol for work. Our partner James described Holacracy as\n\u201cTCP/IP for organizations,\u201d and understood why it appeals to so many technical\nleaders. Our partner Karin wondered if it left a human element behind. To me,\nit felt like playing Dungeons & Dragons -- lots of painfully specific rules\n(now, roll a 20-sided die to figure out how charismatic you are!), but once\nyou grok them, you feel powerful enough to go monster hunting.\n\nThe light bulb went on at the end of training. You\u2019re holding all these\nhandbooks and rule guides in your hands (on nifty reminder cards, no less) and\nyou think, _How will I ever be able to remember all this, let alone use it?_\nThere\u2019s a simple answer: Software.\n\nHolacracy runs on (requires?) a project management tool called\n[GlassFrog](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglassfrog.holacracy.org%2Fpeople%2Fsign_in).\nSo much so, I wondered why have us learn all these new rules at all? Maybe\njust make us use GlassFrog, and then we\u2019ll just be in the new system.\n\nIf you want to implement a new organization, the carrier for the virus is --\nalmost always -- software.\n\nThen I realized that while most startups (surprisingly) do precious little\ninnovation on how they organize themselves (OKRs, a popular Silicon Valley\nframework for goal tracking, is the ultimate management tool for pyramidal\nhierarchies), they are almost always organizational innovators on one\nimportant dimension: Software. Almost every startup uses different software\nfrom a big company to manage its activities.\n\n> An org chart can only handle so much complexity -- every person gets\n> categorized in a single place, more or less. Software can handle lots more.\n\nThis kind of organization-by-software started one function at a time:\nCoordinating a company\u2019s sales to customers (conversations with different\ngroups, both on the seller side and the buyer side) was once intimidatingly\ndifficult to track. Enter CRM, which brought all that conversation to one\nplace. Sales conversations are so complex we need software to make sense of\nthem. (The same change is sweeping other functions -- data collaboration with\nsoftware like Alation, talent tracking with applicant tracking systems, etc.\nCRM set a mold for many other functions to follow.)\n\nAnd across an entire company, the software we use to _run_ startups --\n[GitHub, ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/github) [Slack,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiny-speck) Trello, etc. -- all carries\nwith it profound assumptions about how to organize. Have one person in charge\nof the master copy of something, and others propose changes (i.e., pull\nrequests) where each contribution gets tracked and conflicts get resolved.\n\nLet people who work for a company assign themselves to groups to communicate\non different projects (channels), chunk work up (into cards), reward one\nanother (see our portfolio company, Bonusly), outsource their work (Gigster,\nanother of ours) or talk about a project (Knotable, also a Beta company, in\nthe middle space between \u201cchat that disappears\u201d and \u201cfinished document that\nfeels like too much\u201d).\n\nAn org chart can only handle so much complexity -- every person gets\ncategorized in a single place, more or less. Software can handle lots more.\nInstead of boxing people, software\u2019s metaphor is tagging, where people can be\nassociated with many projects (and opt in and out of them easily).\n\nJames, who was once a software engineer himself, calls all this \u201ctaking the\nmetaphors of software development into the real world.\u201d Software eats the\nworld for breakfast to be sure, and the ideas that software has developed go\nshopping for the groceries beforehand. (Even HR, previously the domain of the\nmerely literate, has become a place for the numerate: you might need to\nunderstand metrics, and the analogies of software, to run a good org.)\n\nSo, while we all debate whether the idea of having managers is fashionable or\nunfashionable, and try to teach ourselves new ways to talk to one another,\nencourage one another, evaluate, monitor, assign, grow, describe, pay and boss\none another\u2019s work -- the software is doing the real work for us.\n\nMaybe, in some way, the new org chart is actually made of software.\n\n(NB: It\u2019s only a short step from here to having the software continue to do\nwork that people once did, as our work in [machine\nintelligence](https://medium.com/@shivon/the-current-state-of-machine-\nintelligence-f76c20db2fe1) suggests will happen more and more\u2026)\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Strategies for small manufacturers to manage underperforming employees - The Fabricator",

can be costly\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n  * ___By[Lisa Wertzbaugher](https://www.thefabricator.com/author/lisa-wertzbaugher)\n  * __November 1, 2019\n  * __[Article](/?filter=article \"Shop

underperforming\nemployees](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/strategies-for-separating-\nunderperforming-employees-1571810616.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/strategies-for-separating-underperforming-\nemployees-1571810616.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nEvery company has one or two; most managers don\u2019t know what to do about them.\nThey\u2019re underperformers, and their presence undermines everything you\u2019re\ntrying to do as a small business owner. _Getty Images_\n\n _ **Editor\u2019s Note:** From her days as a teenager making parts for her\nparents\u2019 fabrication company ([Superior Tube\nProducts](http://www.superiortubeproducts.com/), Davenport, Iowa) to her\nreturn to the business years later as a sales executive, columnist Lisa\nWertzbaugher has lived the life of a metal fabricator. Her position as a\ndirector of the [Tube & Pipe Association,\nInternational](https://www.fmanet.org/membership/affiliations/tube-pipe-\nassociation-international), and her new role as a consultant provide\nadditional insights concerning the operation of a small to medium-sized\nbusinesses._\n\nAs a consultant who deals with clients that vary in annual revenue from\n$300,000 to $500,000,000, I\u2019m usually hired to work on specific projects, each\nwith a unique focus. However, my role doesn\u2019t prevent me from taking in quite\na bit of additional information about my clients, and several trends have been\neasy to spot. One concerns underperforming employees. Many companies have\nunderperformers, and nearly all of them are reluctant to take action. The\nresult is a problem I call the talent drain.  \n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor estimates that a bad hire costs a company\napproximately 30 percent of the employee\u2019s annual salary. I think the costs\nare far higher when all of the factors are included\u2014the effect on culture, the\ndemotivation of high performers, and the negative influence on new hires\ncoming into the organization.  \n\nSo, why is it so hard to people let go? Several reasons come to mind, but here\nare the biggest: The employee is a friend or relative; the company doesn\u2019t\nhave a transition plan to manage the work load; the company is worried about\nfinancial and legal liability; and\u2014the most common one\u2014dealing with it is\nuncomfortable and managers don\u2019t want to do it. As far as the last one, I make\nno judgments\u2014I have been in those shoes myself.  \n\nYou probably have a plan for most contingencies, so why not develop a plan for\ndealing with underperforming employees?  \n\n## Opening the Door, Preparing the Exit  \n\nHere are some options for addressing this situation.  \n\nFrom the start, don\u2019t make the mistake of hiring friends and relatives. Owners\nof small and midsize businesses are typically focused on the day-to-day\noperations and growth. As the company increases in size, it\u2019s easy to start\ntaking shortcuts in hiring. Most owners I work with regret hiring family and\nfriends. If you have a personal relationship with a highly qualified\ncandidate, make sure you clearly define job responsibilities in a job\ndescription signed by the employee upon hire. Assign someone other than family\nor a friend to be their supervisor, and use an objective review form to\ncommunicate performance deficiencies.  \n\nYou need bench strength. Most owners intuitively know who their most reliable\nemployees are, but it\u2019s not enough that the owners know. Let everyone know!\nMaintain an updated organizational chart that identifies all positions\u2014full-\ntime, part-time, temporary, future positions, and future phaseouts. Define the\nposition of everyone in the business on the chart. This exercise defines how\nemployees move throughout the company, making it easy to fill roles that open.\nShare the organizational chart with the entire workforce, and train employees\nthat have the potential to move up in the organization.  \n\nDevelop a transition plan. I spent more than 10 years in medical device sales\nand helped cover open territories several times. Extra (temporary)\ncompensation was customary for this sort of situation, so why not adopt this\nstrategy for your shop? Identify one or two employees in each department who\ncould provide coverage when a position is vacated. Meet with the employees to\nreassign open job tasks and agree on priorities until a new hire is made.\nCommunicate how they will be compensated for the extra work. A side benefit is\nthat word will spread, likely motivating others to step up their game.  \n\nAs far as liability, how do you calculate it? Many would consider paying\nunemployment compensation, but before doing that, go back to the statistic\nfrom the DOL: Keeping a bad employee can cost 30 percent of the employee\u2019s\nannual salary, and that\u2019s year after year. From a dollars-and-cents\nstandpoint, do you really want to pay four years of wages for three years of\nproductivity?  \n\nWork with the human resources (HR) staff to review (or develop) a performance\nimprovement plan. Have an HR representative and the employee\u2019s supervisor go\nover the plan, detailing the areas that need improvement. A savvy employee\nknows that this is a good time to consider a job search. Meanwhile, go over\nseverance package options and vacation payout requirements. Be prepared to\nfollow through.  \n\nMany tools are available to help mitigate company liability when working on a\ntermination. If you don\u2019t have a full-time HR manager, talk to your insurance\ncompany; some offer HR support at no charge.  \n\nYou probably have a comprehensive hiring process that includes an application,\ntesting and screening, successive interviews, and a criminal background check.\nThis is as good a time as any to develop a comprehensive plan for terminating\na worker\u2019s employment. If you already have a strategy, this is a good time to\nbuild a team to review it, make any necessary changes, and train all\nmanagement personnel in how to use it.  \n\n## When One Door Closes, Another Opens  \n\nAn underperformer probably isn\u2019t happy with his situation. He might not be\nhappy anywhere he works, and you can\u2019t do anything about that. Then again,\nmaybe he just needs to find a job that is a better fit for his personality,\naptitudes, and skill set. Keep in mind what we all know: If he\u2019s not\nsucceeding where he is, this is just as detrimental to his long-term career\ngoals as it is to your company\u2019s long-term success.  \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable to deal with, but so are other parts of the job, and they\nget done, so underperforming employees need attention as well. Most owners\nknow they have employees that have received too many chances. It\u2019s always best\nto deliver bad news as soon as possible, so don\u2019t put off a conversation that\nneeds to happen now.  \n\nThe most important consideration when formulating an exit for an\nunderperformers is the effect on your high performers. Nothing is more\ndemotivating to a good employee than a bad employee. The cost of turnover in a\nhigh performer far exceeds the cost of keeping an underperformer on staff, so\nget started rebuilding your workforce today.  \n\n_Lisa Wertzbaugher, founder of Wertzbaugher Consulting, can be reached at\nwertzbaugherconsult@gmail.com_.\n\n##### About the Author\n\n### Lisa Wertzbaugher\n\nFounder\n\nWertzbaugher Consulting\n\n__\n\n[Email Lisa Wertzbaugher](mailto:wertzbaugherconsult@gmail.com \"Lisa\nWertzbaugher\")\n\n__\n\n[See More by Lisa Wertzbaugher](/author/lisa-wertzbaugher)\n\n##### About the Publication\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\napril-2020-1584633775.jpg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/logos/logo_the-\nfabricator.svg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[View the Digital Edition](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the digital\nedition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Subscribe to The FABRICATOR](/subscription/pub/fab \"Subscribe to The\nFABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thefabricator/\n\"Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabricating \"Find The\nFABRICATOR on Twitter\")\n\n##### You May Also Like\n\n[ ](/tubepipejournal/article/shopmanagement/growth-strategies-for-fabricators)\n\n#### [Growth strategies for\nfabricators](/tubepipejournal/article/shopmanagement/growth-strategies-for-\nfabricators)\n\n[ ](/tubepipejournal/article/shopmanagement/taking-big-strides-with-small-\ndiameter-tubing)\n\n#### [Taking big strides with small-diameter\ntubing](/tubepipejournal/article/shopmanagement/taking-big-strides-with-small-\ndiameter-tubing)\n\n[ ](/tubepipejournal/article/tubepipefabrication/a-little-fabricator-grows-up)\n\n#### [A little fabricator grows\nup](/tubepipejournal/article/tubepipefabrication/a-little-fabricator-grows-up)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/design-for-manufacturability-opens-\ndoors)\n\n#### [Design for manufacturability opens\ndoors](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/design-for-manufacturability-\nopens-doors)\n\n#### Get The FABRICATOR updates in your inbox\n\nSign up and be the first to know about the latest industry news, products, and\nevents!\n\nSubscribe\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n  * __\n  * Stay connected from anywhere\n\n  * The FABRICATOR\n  * The Welder\n  * The Tube and Pipe Journal\n  * STAMPING Journal\n  * The Additive Report\n\n[![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\napril-2020-1584633775.jpg)](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the Digital\nEdition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\nNow through June 1, we\u2019re providing full access to the digital edition of _The\nFABRICATOR_.

But the first modern-day organizational chart wasn\u2019t made to\nremind lower-level employees who they really work for. No, one of the first\ncompany-wide organizational charts was actually a 19th century invention of\nnecessity.\n\nBack in the mid-1800s, the Erie Railroad was a thriving but disorganized\ncompany responsible for transporting goods throughout the Northeast. The\nrailroad company had more than 500 miles of track, making it one of the\nlargest of its time. This was good for business, but bad for organization.\n\nToday we deal with inconceivably large amounts of data that is made\ncomprehensible only by modern technology. Back in the 19th century, big data\nmeant something entirely different, but managing it was as vital then as it is\ntoday.\n\nThe entire chart in all its complex glory.\n\n__Image: McKinsey & Company\n\n>This flowery chart was a way to efficiently deliver critical information to\nthe right person.\n\nAs the Erie Railway grew, so did the amount of data it had to wrangle: which\nsuperintendents were responsible for which set of tracks; schedule changes;\nwho the various conductors, laborers and brakemen worked under. As Caitlin\nRosenthal\n[writes](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/big_data_in_the_age_of_the_telegraph)\nover at McKinsey Quarterly, if any one data point was mismanaged it could\nbring dire results: \u201cOne delayed train, for example, could disrupt the\nprogress of many others. And the stakes were high: with engines pulling cars\nin both directions along a single set of rails, schedule changes risked the\ndeadly crashes that plagued 19th-century railroads.\u201d\n\nThis flowery organizational chart was created by Daniel McCallum, the\ncompany\u2019s general manager, to efficiently deliver critical information and\ndelegate tasks to the right person. Instead of a top-down structure, the chart\nflows from its roots like a tree. The power was centralized with the president\nand board of directors as its anchor, but much of the day-to-day\nresponsibility over the tracks was allocated to lower-level superintendents.\nThe reasoning for this, Rosenthal writes: \u201cThey possessed the best operating\ndata, were closer to the action, and thus were best placed to manage the\nline\u2019s persistent inefficiencies.\u201d\n\nYou can glean all sorts of managerial insights from the chart, many of which\nare the opposite of how big companies work today, but the real takeaway here\nis that even more than a century ago, design thinking was sometimes the best\nway to solve a tough problem. Of course, by today\u2019s aesthetic standards, this\nchart might breed more confusion than it eliminates, but it certainly is\npretty to look at.\n\n[hat tip: [Co.Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3026334/this-beautiful-19th-\ncentury-org-chart-puts-your-companys-to-shame?partner=rss)]\n\n  * [#Graphic Design](/tag/graphic-design/)\n\n#### Most Popular\n\n  * [Science\n\n##### The Asian Countries That Beat Covid-19 Have to Do It Again\n\nAuthor: Adam RogersAdam Rogers](https://www.wired.com/story/the-asian-\ncountries-that-beat-covid-19-have-to-do-it-\nagain#intcid=recommendations_default-\npopular_34c01df5-65aa-4e88-b458-91d5174f1537_popular4-1)\n\n  * [Science\n\n##### Why Does Covid-19 Make Some People So Sick?

needs of\ntheir workers, financial and productivity pressures, and regulatory agencies.\nThis requires the ability to listen as well as prioritize work and make sound\ndecisions.  \n\nAt its core, management is little more than getting things done through\nothers. If you want to make sure your management organization is efficient,\nyou\u2019ve first got to consider what it takes to be a good manager \u2014 leadership\nskills, communication skills and the ability to delegate tasks. Then you\u2019ve\ngot to figure out the best organizational structure so employees and managers\nare clear about who does what, can resolve workplace issues quickly, and get\nback to work.\n\nIn the world of construction management, you have have the additional\nchallenge of managing workers who are off site and sometimes in difficult\nconditions with safety hazards, unpredictable weather or complex tasks. You\nalso have agencies, like the OSHA, looking over your shoulder.  \n\nHere are some tips to increase efficiency throughout your construction\nmanagement organization.\n\n### Promote the right people\n\nDon\u2019t automatically assume your best worker will be your best manager.\nPromoting the wrong person is one of the biggest mistakes businesses make in\nlabor management. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, the most skilled\nworkers aren\u2019t always the best equipped to manage others. Both technical and\nleadership skills are important, of course, but being the best at a given job\ndoesn\u2019t make someone the best boss. In fact, it often reduces your\norganizations\u2019 efficiency.\n\nBy taking the most productive worker off the job and promoting them to\nmanager, you\u2019ve just lowered your team\u2019s productivity. In addition, the best\nworker may also be a person who expects others to do things the same way they\ndo. Or, they may have \u2018best practices\u2019 in their head but not the best\ncommunication skills. A skilled worker who is the best a doing their skilled\njob may not be best at leading others to do it.  \n\nHaving technical job skills is important, of course, but it\u2019s only one of the\nmany factors that makes a good manager or leader. So before you consider\npromoting someone to management, ask yourself what makes a good manager?\n\nLet\u2019s take communication for an example. If you put someone in a leadership\nrole who has poor communication skills, what happens? Employees become\ndisengaged and may not be as likely to do great work. The chart below shows\nthe kinds of communication issues that arise when a manager doesn\u2019t have great\ncommunication skills.\n\n![Screen Shot20180131At1 32\n44PM](https://cdn.forconstructionpros.com/files/base/acbm/fcp/image/2018/01/640w/Screen_Shot_2018_01_31_at_1.32.44_PM.5a721e38f0903.jpg)  \nSo how do you improve performance by choosing managers with the right skills?\nThe good news is that entire organizations are dedicated to determining the\nkinds of competencies or skills a good manager should have. With over 30 years\nof research data to support them, Lominger and Korn/Ferry have identified the\nfollowing eight leadership competencies as the most important.\n\n  * Dealing with ambiguity \u2014 managers who can manage change, such as job specs, adapt quickly to get their team on track and work done in spite of changes\n  * Creativity \u2014 managers who can see more than one way to solve a problem and allow their workers to be creative as well  \n\n  * Innovation management \u2014 managers who actively seek out new approaches to save money or improve effectiveness\n  * Strategic agility \u2014 managers with interpersonal skills that allow them to deal with customers, regulatory agencies, insurance company reps, and others who have influence on the work of their team  \n\n  * Planning \u2014 managers who have the insight to prioritize some work ahead of others and to prevent bottlenecks so that workers aren\u2019t idle\n  * Motivating others \u2014 managers who are able to share the big picture and encouraging words to employees, adapting their tone and approach to the individual  \n\n  * Building effective teams \u2014 managers get to know their employees as individuals and help employees understand and work with each other based on their skills and their unique personalities\n  * Managing vision and purpose \u2014 managers who translate the company values to their teams in a way that helps employees feel proud of the work they do and the company they work for\n\nYou\u2019ll notice technical expertise isn\u2019t even on the list! It\u2019s also not\nmentioned by business owners who have a personal management style that works\nfor them. Compare Lominger\u2019s list to that from the Harvard Business Review\nbelow, which also shows technical expertise is further down the list of\nleadership skills needed.  \n\n![Screen Shot20180131At1 32\n57PM](https://cdn.forconstructionpros.com/files/base/acbm/fcp/image/2018/01/640w/Screen_Shot_2018_01_31_at_1.32.57_PM.5a721e37632df.jpg)  \n\nWhat\u2019s at the top of the list are what leadership theorists call soft-skills \u2014\nthose interpersonal skills and abilities that help a person manage and lead.\n\nSo while it\u2019s possible that your best licensed pipefitter has all these\nskills, make sure you consider whether they\u2019ll be best to manage others before\nyou slot them into the next open supervisor position. If not, find someone\ninside or outside your organization who does possess these skills and has\nbasic technical skills, too. Hire or promote them instead if you want to see\nefficiency improve.\n\n### Provide the right tools\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily talking about hammer drills and ground penetrating\nradar. The right tools can make all the difference. Whether it\u2019s project\nmanagement software that helps your managers balance workers\u2019 workloads or\nperformance management tools that help identify which workers need training,\nworkplace tools abound. Choosing the right management tools to help your team\nbe more successful is critical if you want to improve individual performance\nand team efficiency. One way to do this is to ask three simple questions of\nyour management team:\n\n **What are our biggest management organizational headaches?** Is it getting\ntime inputted correctly from field workers, or is it scheduling to make sure\nthat you have a licensed contractor assigned to each jobsite? There are online\nscheduling and timekeeping tools to help streamline paperwork and help your\norganization manage the administrative aspect of labor management so workers\nstay productive.  \n\n **What catches us off guard?** Is it unforeseen circumstances, like customer\nchanges, funding issues, or lawsuits? Stay on top of issues by opening up\nemployee/management communication channels. Maybe all that\u2019s needed is a\nmobile app so that employees and managers can stay in touch throughout the day\nand not be blindsided by last minute issues that didn\u2019t get communicated. Or\nperhaps the tool you need is web-based video conferencing so that your daily\njobsite huddle can include insight from project engineers or safety reps?\n\n **What are our biggest time wasters?** Often productivity is impacted by time\nwasting activities, such as having managers fill out expense reports or having\nworkers hand write and send paper forms to the office to restock their service\nvans. Consider using electronic or web-based tools for everything from\ninventory management of your supplies, simplifying processes like credit card\nprocessing or expense report tracking. There are apps for that, and most can\nbe set up to work from employees\u2019 and managers\u2019 existing mobile phones.  \n\nOnce your management organization has shared their productivity and efficiency\nconcerns with you, consider some strategic investment in software and\ntechnology tools that help them and their teams be more efficient at\nconstruction management.\n\n### Create the right structure\n\nOften, business owners build an organization from the ground up without giving\nthought to the overall reporting structure and decision-making process. This\nslows the organization down in terms of who to contact if an issue arises. Or\nworse, brings it to a screeching halt if a manager doesn\u2019t feel empowered to\nmake a tough decision. Some considerations include:\n\n  * How many people can each manager supervise before they get overwhelmed? Five? Fifteen? Are they available at all times, onsite, or by phone or text during working hours? Who should employees call if managers are unavailable?\n  * How many jobsites can a manager visit in a day or week? Is there a skilled point of contact onsite at each job? Or does the manager need to visit each site each week?  \n\n  * What decisions can employees make on their own versus having to get a supervisor\u2019s approval? Can they buy parts, tools or supplies under $100? What vendors can they order from without a manager\u2019s authorization?\n  * What decision can each level of supervisor make on his own without getting in trouble? Are those decisions based on dollar amounts or policy guidelines?\n\nSimple workplace tools like a contact list, organizational chart and decision\ntree can improve productivity by making it clear who does what. An\norganizational chart would help a manager know who to escalate an issue to\nwhen their VP is out of the office. A contact list would help them reach the\nVP in case of emergency. A decision tree would tell them what kinds of\ndecisions and dollar amounts they can manage on their own. These basic tools\nalone improve productivity so that work isn\u2019t bottlenecked in bureaucracy and\nfinger pointing, causing labor costs to go up and efficiency to bottom out.\n\n### Document policies and practices clearly\n\nSimilarly, people who don\u2019t know what the rules, and/or haven\u2019t been trained\nare going to make mistakes so document, document, document. It doesn\u2019t have to\nbe a full-blown government-style policy manual (unless you\u2019re a government\ncontractor), but make sure you have simple job aids and how-to guides to\nsupport your workforce. Make it easy for managers to point to or reference\ncompany policies and procedures when they\u2019re providing training or delegating\ntasks to employees. That way they spend less time fixing on-the-job mistakes\nand more time coaching trained and informed employees to peak performance.\n\nConsider these work related examples of documentation:\n\n  * A list of when and what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn on each job as well as who to notify in case of an accident or incident\n  * Posted instructions on things like how to change and charge batteries, when and how to fuel vehicles, or how to start up and shut down important equipment  \n\n  * Quick online access to building codes or similar documents so they don\u2019t have to lug around outdated manuals or stand around waiting for answers\n  * Safety instructions for how to lock-out/tag-out each piece of equipment as well as electronic access to the MSDS on your company intranet, accessible by smartphone  \n\n  * Start of the day sign-in, check-in, clock-in instructions and end of the day sign-out, clock-out, lock-up instructions\n  * Guidelines for keeping jobsite safe, clean and clear\n\nSome companies go as far as to provide a \u201chow-to\u201d website or app to employees,\ncomplete with step-by-step work instructions and expert videos showing how to\ndo complex tasks. Consider having new employees learn from more experienced\nones by watching short video lessons on the company\u2019s YouTube channel. This\nprovides a foundation for new hires and allows managers to provide coaching\nand feedback to employees just-in-time, on-the job. Instead of wasting hours\nin a classroom, they can get to work. It allows employees to empower\nthemselves by looking for answers to common company questions, like which glue\ngoes with which type of PVC pipe?\n\n### Create a people friendly workplace\n\nTrust, empowerment and employee self-management are those warm-fuzzy topics\nthat traditional business leaders find difficult to quantify. They, therefore,\nmight not invest in these efficiency boosters. The buzzword to know is\nemployee engagement, which means employees who feel connected to their work,\ntheir bosses and their employers because they feel trusted, valued and\nempowered. Where else can your business get a [25% performance\nboost](https://dynamicsignal.com/2017/04/21/employee-productivity-statistics-\nevery-stat-need-know/)?\n\nSo if you want to improve individual productivity and overall efficiency, take\nsome time to consider how you can improve in these areas:\n\n **Trust**\n\nOrganizations build trust with their employees through two way dialog and\ntransparency. Remember the old, \u201cmy door is always open\u201d policy? Efficient\norganizations have that. They don\u2019t let problems fester and erode trust. They\ndeal with them openly and seek input from managers and employees at all levels\nwhenever policies or processes change. In addition, trust starts from the top\ndown, and employees will only feel trust if they have access to people who can\n(and do) provide answers to their questions. Of course, this only occurs if\nyou put the right type of managers in charge of employees in the first place.\nIf they\u2019re good two-way communicators who inspire trust and engage employees,\nyour company efficiency will improve.\n\n **Empowerment**\n\nIf the only person making decisions is the top tier executive owners or\nbusiness leaders, you\u2019re wasting 100% of the brain power of the rest of the\norganization. So once you have your decision tree in place and people know\nwhat their responsibilities are, don\u2019t second guess and micromanage. Let\nemployees and their managers do their jobs. And let them make mistakes. Then\nask what they\u2019ve learned and encourage them to communicate those mistakes for\nthe benefit of the entire organization.\n\n **Self-management**\n\nSome employers are moving in the direction of self-managed employees. They do\nthis not by managing the input or work effort of the employee but instead by\nmanaging the output or results of those efforts. They use metrics. This\nrequires a management organization that uses the right tools to manage\nperformance, makes critical knowledge and rules available to employees on the\njob, and rewards performance based on measurable results. Then they get out of\nthe employees way, using managers mostly only to support employee efforts.\nBoth employee engagement and worker productivity improve in employee-self-\nmanaged organizations. But they take a little thought to set up.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nThese five things \u2014 the right people as managers, the right tools, the right\nstructure, clear rules, and a people-friendly environment \u2014 are the best\noptions you have to improve organizational efficiency. And if you really want\nan efficient management organization that supports workplace growth and\nefficiency, we recommend that you do them all \u2014 starting with the right people\nthat will help you by providing their leadership insight to do the rest.\n\n _Gavin Graham is a staff writer at Fit Small Business, focusing on creating\nBuyer\u2019s Guides on a variety of small business topics.

Cloud-based project management\nservices enable organizations to create, plan, manage and report on projects,\nacross distributed teams and locations.\n\n## Cloud Project Management Features\n\nTypical features that are part of cloud project management software offerings\ninclude:\n\n  * **Collaboration.** The ability to communicate and share information with team members about a project is a foundational element of project management.\n\n  * **Task Management.** The primary capability of all project management tools is all about creating lists of tasks that are tracked and managed as part of a given project.\n\n  * **Time Tracking.** Keeping track of time allocated and used for project is an important project management capability.\n\n  * **Scheduling.** It's not enough to just assign tasks, project management is also about scheduling due dates and managing deliverables. Typically project management tools use Gantt charts to visually illustrate a project schedule.\n\n## How to Choose the Right Cloud Project Management Solution\n\nThere are a lot of different options for organizations to consider when it\ncomes to cloud-based project management tools. While one tool might be the\nideal fit for one company, it might not be for another. There are a number of\nkey considerations to evaluate as part of a decision on cloud project\nmanagement\n\n  * **Features.** The basics of project management, including scheduling, task creation and project tracking are part of all cloud-based project management tools. Beyond the basics, it's important to identify if there are other required features that are needed, whether it's directly integrated billing or a specific type of collaboration capability that is needed.\n\n  * **Integrations.** Every organization is already using all kinds of different tools to get things done, whether it's an existing collaboration, file sharing, customer relationship management or other tool. Identify the tools that matter to your organization and make sure that the project management service you're considering has integrations with them.\n\n  * **Cost.** Cloud-based tools are always driven by cost per user subscriptions. Consider the total cost to operate a given service as a key consideration when evaluating different options.\n\nhttps://o1.qnsr.com/log/p.gif?;n=203;c=204660771;s=9478;x=7936;f=201812281332180;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;a=20403946;e=i\n\nIn this _Datamation_ top companies list, we spotlight the vendors that offer\nthe top cloud-based project management tools.\n\n  * Zoho Projects\n  * Celoxis \n  * Clarizen\n  * LiquidPlanner \n  * Mavenlink \n  * Microsoft Project Online\n  * Monday.com \n  * ProWorkflow\n  * Scoro\n  * Wrike\n  * Vendor Comparison Chart\n\n## **Zoho Projects![zoho](/imagesvr_ce/2608/zoho-projects.png)**\n\n**Value proposition for potential buyers:**  Using Zoho projects might seem\nlike an obvious choice for those that are already using Zoho for CRM or Zoho\noffice software, but it can also benefit other organizations as a standalone\nchoice for project management.

Kopp](https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/53711/)\n\nUpdated Jun 25, 2019\n\n##  What Is a PERT Chart?\n\nA PERT chart is a [project\nmanagement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp) tool\nthat provides a graphical representation of a project's timeline. The Program\nEvaluation Review Technique (PERT) breaks down the individual tasks of a\nproject for analysis. PERT charts are considered preferable to [Gantt\ncharts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gantt-chart.asp) because they\nidentify task dependencies, but they're often more difficult to interpret.\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * PERT charts were first created by the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office in 1957 to guide the Polaris nuclear submarine project.\n  * A PERT chart uses circles or rectangles called nodes to represent project events or milestones. These nodes are linked by vectors, or lines, that represent various tasks.\n  * A PERT chart allows managers to evaluate the time and resources necessary to manage a project.\n\n##  How Do PERT Charts Work?\n\nA PERT chart uses circles or rectangles called nodes to represent project\nevents or milestones. These nodes are linked by vectors or lines that\nrepresent various tasks.\n\nDependent tasks are items that must be performed in a specific manner. For\nexample, if an arrow is drawn from Task No. 1 to Task No. 2 on a PERT chart,\nTask No. 1 must be completed before work on Task No. 2 begins.\n\nItems at the same stage of production but on different task lines within a\nproject are referred to as parallel tasks. They're independent of each other,\nbut they're planned to occur at the same time.\n\nA well-constructed PERT chart looks like this:\n\n![](//:0)\n\nSource: <http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/PERT-chart>\n\n##  Interpreting PERT Charts\n\nA PERT chart is a visual representation of a series of events that must occur\nwithin a project\u2019s lifetime. The direction of arrows indicates the flow and\nsequence of events required for project completion. Dotted activity lines\nrepresent dummy activities\u2014items that are located on another PERT path.\nNumbers and time allotments are assigned and shown inside each vector.\n\nThese charts have their distinct [definitions and\nterms](https://www.projectmanager.com/training/create-a-pert-chart), the most\nimportant of which anticipate how long it will take to finalize a project.\n\"Optimistic time\" refers to the shortest duration, and \"pessimistic time\" is\nlogically the longest it might take. The \"most likely time\" indicates a\nreasonable estimate of the best-case scenario, whereas \"expected time\"\naccounts for problems and obstacles.\n\n##  The Benefits of PERT Charts\n\nA PERT chart allows managers to evaluate the time and resources necessary to\nmanage a project. This evaluation includes the ability to track [required\nassets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/core-assets.asp) during any stage\nof production in the course of the entire project.\n\nPERT analysis incorporates data and information from multiple departments.\nThis combining of information encourages department responsibility, and it\nidentifies all responsible parties across the organization. It also improves\ncommunication during the project, and it allows an organization to commit to\nprojects that are relevant to its strategic positioning.\n\nFinally, PERT charts are useful for [what-if\nanalyses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sensitivityanalysis.asp).\nUnderstanding the possibilities concerning the flow of project resources and\nmilestones allows management to achieve the most efficient and useful project\npath.\n\n##  The Disadvantages of PERT Charts\n\nThe use of a PERT chart is highly subjective, and its success depends on the\nmanagement\u2019s experience. These charts can include unreliable data or\nunreasonable estimations for cost or time for this reason.\n\nPERT charts are deadline-focused, and they might not fully communicate the\n[financial\npositioning](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/063004.asp)\nof a project. Because a PERT chart is labor intensive, the establishment and\nmaintenance of the information require additional time and resources.\nContinual review of the information provided, as well as prospective\npositioning of the project, is required for a PERT chart to be valuable.\n\n##  A Real World Example of a PERT Chart\n\nAccording to the paper \"Application of a Technique for Research and\nDevelopment Program Evaluation\" published in [_Operations\nResearch_](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/opre.7.5.646), PERT\ncharts were first created by the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office in 1957\nto guide the Polaris nuclear submarine project. They've since been used all\nover the world and in numerous industries.\n\nCompare Accounts\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from

Or that hidden \"influencers\" in your company could be\nreliably identified and convinced to be key agents in change initiatives. In\nanother scenario, envision an ability to help pinpoint and reduce\ncommunication bottlenecks in your company, improving workforce productivity\nand engagement.\n\nThese objectives now are possible through use of organizational network\nanalysis (ONA), an emerging form of HR technology that captures data from\ne-mail, instant messages, feedback surveys and collaboration platforms to help\nidentify and understand how people communicate within an organization.\n\nONA software provides a structured way to visualize formal and informal\nrelationships in organizations by analyzing how communications, decisions and\ninformation flow internally, said David Mallon, head of research for Bersin by\nDeloitte, an HR research and consulting firm in New York City.\n\n\"Interest in using the methodology and toolsets related to ONA is growing,\"\nMallon said. \"Companies and HR leaders are using ONA to identify existing\ncommunication pathways and bottlenecks, to assess engagement levels and to\ndetermine if organizational structures need to change.\"\n\nDeloitte's 2017 _Global Human Capital Trends_ survey found that 48 percent of\nrespondents were experimenting with ONA tools. The survey included responses\nfrom 10,400 business and HR leaders across 140 countries. Cisco Systems, Cigna\nHealth Insurance and General Motors and other businesses are using ONA to help\nidentify productivity patterns, high-potential leaders and diversity issues,\naccording to a related Bersin by Deloitte report on HR technology trends.\n\nOne company in the Bersin report used ONA tools to analyze communication in\nits sales function and found that many experts in the group were being\noverlooked.  After creating a new team-centric structure, the sales function's\ntotal generated revenue rose by more than 12 percent.\n\nEstablished ONA vendors include companies like\n[Trustsphere](https://www.trustsphere.com/),\n[KeenCorp](http://www.keencorporation.com/) and [Microsoft\nDelve](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Office-\nDelve-1315665a-c6af-4409-a28d-49f8916878ca). Some of the vendors in this class\nalso have tools that identify the mood or tone of internal communications to\nassess where organizations might be under stress\u2014or to help uncover potential\nfraud. As ONA vendors grow in functionality and capability, experts expect\nmany providers will be incorporated into core talent management platforms.\n\nHow ONA Works\n\nMallon said there are informal \"go-to\" teams or individuals in every\norganization that serve as hidden influencers, those whose opinions hold sway\nwith peers and who know how to get things accomplished\u2014or know how to quickly\nfind the right people with the answers. ONA technology can help uncover these\nindividuals by analyzing \"nodes and ties\" of communication networks in\ncompanies.\n\nA \"central node\" in an ONA is an employee who is well-connected in a company,\nwho shares information readily and who is considered influential, according to\nMallon. \"Ties\" are the formal and informal relationships created between these\ncentral nodes and others. It's important to create strong ties between nodes\nand \"knowledge brokers\"\u2014individuals who create bridges between departments or\nteams\u2014to ensure information flows effectively throughout a company.\n\nONA helps identify problems with silos that aren't communicating, for example,\nand where stronger connections might be built. Formal organizational charts\ndon't always reflect the networks of people who get vital work done in\norganizations, Mallon said. \"These people can become key change agents during\nperiods of transformation or amid organization rollouts if approached and\ncommunicated with effectively.\"\n\nONA also can be valuable in creating new, more efficient organizational\nstructures that reflect changes in how work is being done. \"An ONA toolset can\nhelp you determine if an org structure should be redesigned to be flatter or\nmore team-oriented, for example,\" Mallon said.\n\nHR's Role in ONA\n\nAlthough ONA use among HR professionals is not yet formally tracked in Sierra-\nCedar's annual HR Systems Survey, it represents \"an emerging trend,\" said\nStacey Harris, vice president of research and analytics for the IT research\nand consulting firm in Alpharetta, Ga **.** \"The technology is in the new\nclass of productivity-enhancing software, at the intersection of tools\ndesigned to improve engagement, performance and productivity.\"\n\nHarris said there's potential to increase ONA's impact by integrating it with\nexisting technologies like workforce management platforms. \"If leaders can\nlook at which employees were scheduled over what time periods and pair it with\nONA data, for example, it can prove valuable in making better scheduling\ndecisions,\" she said. \"It provides more intelligence on who should be placed\non what projects or shifts, based on patterns of communication and influence\nidentified through the nodes, ties and connectors of ONA.\"\n\nHR leaders should play a prominent role in overseeing or implementing such\nworkforce productivity tools, said Holger Mueller, vice president and\nprincipal analyst for Constellation Research, a technology research firm in\nCupertino, Calif., and should partner with IT to ensure these new systems\ncomplement or integrate with their existing platforms.\n\n\"HR should be a shepherd and advocate for technologies like ONA,\" Mueller\nsaid. \"Any technology that provides a better understanding of how work really\ngets done inside organizations, improves work lives or makes people more\nproductive should be on the radar of HR.\"\n\n _Dave Zielinski is a freelance business writer in Minneapolis._\n\n>  _Was this article useful?

Introducing a new line of communication devices for the Asian\nmarket required reorienting its sales, marketing, and support functions.\nMigrating to cloud-based business applications called for changes to the IT\norganization. Altogether, it had reorganized six times in 10 years.\n\nSuddenly, however, the company found itself facing a different challenge.\nBecause of the new technologies that had entered its category, and a sea\nchange in customer expectations, the CEO decided to shift from a product-based\nbusiness model to a customer-centric one. That meant yet another\nreorganization, but this one would be different. It had to go beyond shifting\nthe lines and boxes in an org chart. It would have to change the company's\nmost fundamental building blocks: how people in the company made decisions,\nadopted new behaviors, rewarded performance, agreed on commitments, managed\ninformation, made sense of that information, allocated responsibility, and\nconnected with one another. Not only did the leadership team lack a full-\nfledged blueprint -- they didn't know where to begin.\n\nThis situation is becoming more typical. In the [18th annual PwC survey of\nchief executive officers](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/ceo-survey/index.html),\nconducted in 2014, many CEOs anticipated significant disruptions to their\nbusinesses during the next five years as a result of global trends. One such\ntrend, cited by 61 percent of the respondents, was heightened competition. The\nsame proportion of respondents foresaw changes in customer behavior creating\ndisruption. Fifty percent said they expected changes in distribution channels.\nAs CEOs look to stay ahead of these trends, they recognize the need to change\ntheir organization's design. But for that redesign to succeed, a company must\nmake its changes as effectively and painlessly as possible, in a way that\naligns with its strategy, invigorates employees, builds distinctive\ncapabilities, and makes it easier to attract customers.\n\nToday, the average tenure for the CEO of a global company is about five years.\nTherefore, a major re-organization is likely to happen only once during that\nleader's term. The chief executive has to get the reorg right the first time;\nhe or she won't get a second chance.\n\nThe chief executive has to get the reorg right the first time; he or she won't\nget a second chance.\n\nAlthough every company is different, and there is no set formula for\ndetermining the appropriate design for your organization, we have identified\n10 guiding principles that apply to every company. These have been developed\nthrough years of research and practice at PwC and Strategy&, using changes in\norganization design to improve performance in more than 400 companies across\nindustries and geographies. These fundamental principles point the way for\nleaders whose strategies require a different kind of organization than the one\nthey have today.\n\n**1\\. Declare amnesty for the past.** Organization design should start with\ncorporate self-reflection: What is your sense of purpose? How will you make a\ndifference for your clients, employees, and investors? What will set you apart\nfrom others, now and in the future? What differentiating capabilities will\nallow you to deliver your value proposition over the next two to five years?\n\nFor many business leaders, answering those questions means going beyond your\ncomfort zone. You have to set a bold direction, marshal the organization\ntoward that goal, and prioritize everything you do accordingly. Sustaining a\nforward-looking view is crucial.\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318ab.gif)\n\nWe've seen a fair number of organization design initiatives fail to make a\ndifference because senior executives got caught up in discussing the pros and\ncons of the old organization. Avoid this situation by declaring \"amnesty for\nthe past.\" Collectively, explicitly decide that you will neither blame nor try\nto justify the design in place today or any organization designs of the past.\nIt's time to move on. This type of pronouncement may sound simple, but it's\nsurprisingly effective for keeping the focus on the new strategy.\n\n**2\\. Design with \"DNA.\"** Organization design can seem unnecessarily complex;\nthe right framework, however, can help you decode and prioritize the necessary\nelements. We have identified [eight universal building\nblocks](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/10minutes/organizational-dna.jhtml) that are\nrelevant to any company, regardless of industry, geography, or business model.\nThese building blocks will be the elements you put together for your design (\n_see Exhibit 1_ ).\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318_ex1b.1.gif)\n\nThe blocks naturally fall into four complementary pairs, each made up of one\ntangible (or formal) and one intangible (or informal) element. Decisions are\npaired with norms (governing how people act), motivators with commitments\n(governing factors that affect people's feelings about their work),\ninformation with mind-sets (governing how they process knowledge and meaning),\nand structure with networks (governing how they connect). By using these\nelements and considering changes needed across each complementary pair, you\ncan create a design that will integrate your whole enterprise, instead of\npulling it apart.\n\nYou may be tempted to make changes with all eight building blocks\nsimultaneously. But too many interventions at once could interact in\nunexpected ways, leading to unfortunate side effects. Pick a small number of\nchanges -- five at most -- that you believe will deliver the greatest initial\nimpact. Even a few changes could involve many variations. For example, the\ndesign of motivators might need to vary from one function to the next. People\nin sales might be more heavily influenced by monetary rewards, whereas R&D\nstaffers might favor a career model with opportunities for self-directed\nprojects and external collaboration and education.\n\n**3\\. Fix the structure last, not first.** Company leaders know that their\ncurrent org chart doesn't necessarily capture the way things get done -- it's\nat best a vague approximation. Yet they still may fall into a common trap:\nthinking that changing their organization's structure will address their\nbusiness's problems.\n\nWe can't blame them -- after all, the org chart is seemingly the most powerful\ncommunications vehicle around. It also carries emotional weight, because it\ndefines reporting relationships that people might love or hate. But a company\nhierarchy, particularly when changes in the org chart are made in isolation\nfrom other changes, tends to revert to its earlier equilibrium. You can\nsignificantly remove management layers and temporarily reduce costs, but all\ntoo soon, the layers creep back in and the short-term gains disappear.\n\nIn an org redesign, you're not setting up a new form for the organization all\nat once. You're laying out a sequence of interventions that will lead the\ncompany from the past to the future. Structure should be the last thing you\nchange: the capstone, not the cornerstone, of that sequence. Otherwise, the\nchange won't sustain itself.\n\nWe saw the value of this approach recently with an industrial goods\nmanufacturer. In the past, it had undertaken reorganizations that focused\nalmost solely on structure, without ever achieving the execution improvement\nits leaders expected. Then the stakes grew higher: Fast-growing competitors\nemerged from Asia, technological advances compressed product cycles, and new\nbusiness models appeared that bypassed distributors. This time, instead of\nredrawing the lines and boxes, the company sought to understand the\norganizational factors that had slowed down its responses in the past. There\nwere problems in the way decisions were made and carried out, and in how\ninformation flowed. Therefore, the first changes in the sequence concerned\nthese building blocks: eliminating non-productive meetings (information),\nclarifying accountabilities in the matrix structure (decisions and norms), and\nchanging how people were rewarded (motivators). By the time the company was\nready to adjust the org chart, most of the problem factors had been addressed.\n\n**4\\. Make the most of top talent.** Talent is a critical but often overlooked\nfactor when it comes to org design. You might assume that the personalities\nand capabilities of existing executive team members won't affect the design\nmuch. But in reality, you need to design positions to make the most of the\nstrengths of the people who will occupy them. In other words, consider the\ntechnical skills and managerial acumen of key people, and make sure those\nleaders are equipped to foster the collaboration and empowerment needed from\npeople below them.\n\nYou must ensure that there is a connection between the capabilities you need\nand the leadership talent you have. For example, if you're organizing the\nbusiness on the basis of innovation and the ability to respond quickly to\nchanges in the market, the person chosen as chief marketing officer will need\na diverse background. Someone with a conventional marketing background whose\ncore skills center on low-cost pricing and extensive distribution might not be\ncomfortable in that role. You can sometimes compensate for a gap in\nproficiency through other team members. If the chief financial officer is an\nexcellent technician but has little leadership charisma, you may balance him\nor her with a chief operating officer who excels at the public-facing aspects\nof the role, such as speaking with analysts.\n\nAs you assemble the leadership team for your strategy, look for an optimal\nspan of control -- the number of direct reports -- for your senior executive\npositions. A Harvard Business School study conducted by [associate professor\nJulie\nWulf](https://securefiles.harvardbusiness.org/h-s/20130617/533337dce78f40c6)\nfound that CEOs have doubled their span of control over the past two decades.\nAlthough many executives have seven direct reports, there's no universal magic\nnumber. For CEOs, the optimal span of control depends on four factors: the\nCEO's tenure thus far, the degree of cross-collaboration among business units,\nthe level of CEO activity devoted to something other than working with direct\nreports, and whether the CEO is also chairman of the board. (We've created a\n[C-level span-of-control\ndiagnostic](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what_we_do/services/ocl/ocl_thought_leadership/structure_at_the_top/span-\nof-control-diagnostic) to help determine your target span.)\n\n**5\\. Focus on what you can control.** Make a list of the things that hold\nyour organization back: the scarcities (things you consistently find in short\nsupply) and constraints (things that consistently slow you down). Taking stock\nof real-world limitations helps ensure that you can execute and sustain the\nnew organization design.\n\nFor example, consider the impact you might face if 20 percent of the people\nwho had the most knowledge and expertise in making and marketing your core\nproducts -- your product launch talent -- were drawn away for three years on a\nregulatory project. How would that talent shortage affect your product launch\ncapability, especially if it involved identifying and acting on customer\ninsights? How might you compensate for this scarcity? Doubling down on\naddressing typical scarcities, or what is \"not good enough,\" helps prioritize\nthe changes to your organization model. For example, you may build a product\nlaunch center of excellence to address the typical scarcity of never having\nenough of the people who know how to execute effective launches.\n\nConstraints on your business -- such as regulations, supply shortages, and\nchanges in customer demand -- may be out of your control. But don't get bogged\ndown in trying to change something you can't change; instead, focus on\nchanging what you can. For example, if your company is a global consumer\npackaged goods manufacturer, you might first favor a single structure with\nclear decision rights on branding, policies, and usage guidelines because it\nis more efficient in global branding. But if consumer tastes for your product\nare different around the world, you might be better off with a structure that\ndelegates decision rights to the local business leader.\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318_ex2b.1.gif)\n\n**6\\. Promote accountability.** Design your organization so that it's easy for\npeople to be accountable for their part of the work without being\nmicromanaged. Make sure that decision rights are clear and that information\nflows rapidly and clearly from the executive committee to business units,\nfunctions, and departments. Our research underscores the importance of this\nfactor: We analyzed dozens of companies with strong execution and found that\namong the formal building blocks, information and decision rights had the\nstrongest effect on improving the execution of strategy. They are about twice\nas powerful as an organization's structure or its motivators ( _see Exhibit 2_\n).\n\nA global electronics manufacturer was struggling with slow execution and lack\nof accountability. To address these issues, it created a matrix that could\nidentify those who had made important decisions in the past few years. It then\nused the matrix to establish clear decision rights and motivators more in tune\nwith the company's desired goals. Sales directors were made accountable for\ndealers in their region and were evaluated in terms of the sales performance\nof those dealers. This encouraged ownership and high performance on both\nsides, and drew in critically important but previously isolated groups, like\nthe manufacturer's warranty function. The company operationalized these new\ndecision rights by establishing the necessary budget authorities, decision-\nmaking forums, and communications.\n\nWhen decision rights and motivators are established, accountability can take\nhold. Gradually, people get in the habit of following through on commitments\nwithout experiencing formal enforcement. Even after it becomes part of the\ncompany's culture, this new accountability must be continually nurtured and\npromoted. It won't endure if, for example, [new additions to the firm don't\nhonor commitments](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00267) or\nincentives change in a way that undermines the desired behavior.\n\n**7\\. Benchmark sparingly, if at all.** One common misstep is looking for best\npractices. In theory, it can be helpful to track what competitors are doing,\nif only to help you optimize your own design or uncover issues requiring\nattention. But in practice, this approach has a couple of problems.\n\nFirst, it ignores your organization's unique capabilities system -- the\nstrengths that only your organization has, which produces results that others\ncan't match. You and your competitor aren't likely to need the same\ndistinctive capabilities, even if you're in the same industry. For example,\ntwo banks might look similar on the surface; they might have branches next\ndoor to each other in several locales. But the first could be a national bank\ncatering to millennials, who are drawn to low costs and innovative online\nbanking features. The other could be regionally oriented, serving an older\ncustomer base and emphasizing community ties and personalized customer\nservice. Those different value propositions would require different\ncapabilities and translate into different organization designs. The national\nbank might be organized primarily by customer segment, making it easy to\ninvest in a single leading-edge technology that covers all regions and all\nmarkets. The regional bank might be organized primarily by geography, setting\nup managers to build better relationships with local leaders and enterprises.\nIf you benchmark the wrong example, the copied organizational model will only\nset you back.\n\nSecond, even if you share the same strategy as a competitor, who's to say that\nits organization is a good fit with its strategy? If your competitor has a\ndifferent value proposition or capabilities system than you do, using it as a\ncomparison for your own performance will be a mistake.\n\nIf you feel you must benchmark, focus on a few select elements, rather than\ntrying to be best in class in everything related to your industry. Your choice\nof companies to follow, and of the indicators to track and analyze, should\nline up exactly with the capabilities you prioritized in setting your future\ncourse. For example, if you are expanding into emerging markets, you might\nbenchmark the extent to which leading companies in that region give local\noffices decision rights on sourcing or distribution.\n\n**8\\. Let the \"lines and boxes\" fit your company's purpose.** For every\ncompany, there is an optimal pattern of hierarchical relationship -- a golden\nmean. It isn't the same for every company; it should reflect the strategy you\nhave chosen, and it should support the critical capabilities that distinguish\nyour company. That means that the right structure for one company will not be\nthe same as the right structure for another, even if they're in the same\nindustry.\n\nIn particular, think through your purpose when designing the spans of control\nand layers in your org chart. These should be fairly consistent across the\norganization.\n\nYou can often hasten the flow of information and create greater accountability\nby reducing layers. But if the structure gets too flat, your leaders have to\nsupervise an overwhelming number of people. You can free up management time by\nadding staff, but if the pyramid becomes too steep, it will be hard to get\nclear messages from the bottom to the top. So take the nature of your\nenterprise into account. Does the work at your company require close\nsupervision? What role does technology play? How much collaboration is\ninvolved? How far-flung are people geographically, and what is their preferred\nmanagement style?\n\nIn a call center, 15 or 20 people might report to a single manager because the\nwork is routine and heavily automated. An enterprise software implementation\nteam, made up of specialized knowledge workers, would require a narrower span\nof control, such as six to eight employees. If people regularly take on\nstretch assignments and broadly participate in decision making, you might have\na narrower hierarchy -- more managers directing only a few people each --\ninstead of setting up managers with a large number of direct reports.\n\n**9\\. Accentuate the informal.** Formal elements like structure and\ninformation are attractive to companies because they're tangible. They can be\neasily defined and measured. But they're only half the story. Many companies\nreassign decision rights, rework the org chart, or set up knowledge-sharing\nsystems -- yet don't see the results they expect.\n\nThat's because they've ignored the more informal, intangible building blocks.\nNorms, commitments, mind-sets, and networks are essential in getting things\ndone. They represent (and influence) the ways people think, feel, communicate,\nand behave. When these intangibles are not in sync with one another or the\nmore tangible building blocks, the organization falters.\n\nAt one technology company, it was common practice to have multiple \"meetings\nbefore the meeting\" and \"meetings after the meeting.\" In other words, the\nconstructive debate and planning took place outside the formal presentations\nthat were known as the \"official meetings.\" The company had long relied on its\ninformal networks because people needed workarounds to many official rules.\nNow, as part of the redesign, the leaders of the company embraced its informal\nnature, adopting new decision rights and norms that allowed the company to\nmove more fluidly, and abandoning official channels as much as possible.\n\n**10\\. Build on your strengths.** Overhauling the organization is one of the\nhardest things for a chief executive or division leader to do, especially if\nhe or she is charged with turning around a poorly performing company. But\nthere are always strengths to build on in existing practices and in the\nculture. Suppose, for example, that your company has a norm of customer-\noriented commitment. Employees are willing to go the extra mile for customers\nwhen called upon to do so. They deliver work out of scope or ahead of\nschedule, often because they empathize with the problems customers face. You\ncan draw attention to that behavior by setting up groups to talk about it, and\nreinforce the behavior by rewarding it with more formal incentives. That will\nhelp spread it throughout the company.\n\nPerhaps your company has well-defined decision rights, wherein each person has\na good idea of the decisions and actions for which he or she is responsible.\nYet in your current org design, they may not be focused on the right things.\nYou can use this strong accountability and redirect people to the right\ndecisions to support the new strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA [2014 Strategy&\nsurvey](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/press/displays/concerns-\nexecutives-strategy-execution-gap) found that 42 percent of executives felt\nthat their organization was not aligned with the strategy, and that parts of\nthe organization resisted it or didn't understand it. If that's a familiar\nproblem in your company, the principles in this article can help you develop\nan organization design that supports your most distinctive capabilities and\nsupports your strategy more effectively.\n\nRemaking your organization to align with your strategy is a project that only\nthe top executive of a company, division, or enterprise can lead. Although\nit's not practical for a CEO to manage the day-to-day details, the top leader\nof a company must be consistently present to work through the major issues and\nalternatives, focus the design team on the future, and be accountable for the\ntransition to the new organization. The chief executive will also set the tone\nfor future updates: Changes in technology, customer preferences, and other\ndisruptors will continually test your business model.\n\nThese 10 fundamental principles can serve as your guideposts for any\nreorganization, large or small. Armed with these collective lessons, you can\navoid common missteps and home in on the right blueprint for your business.\n![](/media/image/end_of_story.gif)\n\nReprint No. 00318\n\n## Author Profiles:\n\n  * **[Gary L.

The cycle unfolds again (and again) as the fallen\nwonder gets replaced by the \u201cnext big thing\u201d. In the process, a perfectly\nsensible practice that could work well for some organisations to solve some\nproblems may become unfashionable enough to be rejected by most organisations.\nThe baby is gone with the bathwater.\n\nWe fear that a similar fate awaits the latest panacea \u2013 the set of\norganisational practices that have come to be known as \u201cAgile\u201d. At this point,\nevery top management consulting company in the world has some version of a\n\u201csee how Agile you are\u201d diagnostic survey, as well as a \u201chere is how we can\nhelp you become Agile\u201d offering advertised on its website. The first premise,\noften stated explicitly, is that every company, whether an FMCG giant or a\nnational bank, needs to become Agile. Fair enough \u2013 who wants to be \u201cclumsy\u201d?\n\nThe second, not so explicit, is that the particular set of organisational\npractices being advertised, largely revolving around the use of cross-\nfunctional teams with self-organising elements, is _the_ path to get there.\nThe evidence for the second premise is simply non-existent at this point. In\nfact, everything we know from the study of organisation design suggests it is\nquite unlikely to be true.\n\nTo be clear, there is no disputing the appeal of organisations that are both\nefficient and innovative, which seems to be the promise of \u201cAgile\u201d. This is a\nproblem that organisational scientists have been studying for a very long time\nunder a variety of names (\u201c[ **ambidexterity**](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-\nambidextrous-organization)\u201d, \u201c **[exploration vs.\nexploitation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634940?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)**\n\u201d, \u201c[ **organic vs. mechanistic\nstructures**](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-management-of-\ninnovation-9780198288787?cc=us&lang=en&)\u201d to name but a few). We think we\nunderstand quite well why it is hard to accomplish both, as well as the\nnuances around the kinds of solutions that are possible under specific\nconditions.\n\nWe\u2019ll go further: We are fans of Agile practices as a solution to a distinct\nclass of problems in certain contexts, such as those involving a search, be it\nfor new designs, product features or even management policies. Agile practices\nuse rapid, parallel and inexpensive iterations to solve search problems. If\nthere are parts of your organisation that can benefit from this kind of\nproblem solving, then Agile design may be for you. Even then, not all search\nproblems may benefit from Agile practices. The relevance of Agile is murkier\nstill if the context is one of execution, e.g. when the firm seeks to attain\nhigh levels of reliability with well understood processes.\n\nWhat we want to caution against is the indiscriminate application of Agile\nbeyond search situations, in large part because the inevitable disillusionment\nmay then discourage even sensible adoption. Let\u2019s keep that poor baby from\ndisappearing with the bathwater.\n\n**Where Agile comes from**\n\nAgile practices grew out of a product development framework widely adopted by\nthe software industry. Also called \u201cscrum\u201d, its central principle is to set up\nhighly autonomous and independent teams, each working on a different aspect of\na larger, complex problem. Instead of marching in bureaucratic formation, they\nare given freedom to \u201csprint\u201d, i.e. rapidly advance in parallel towards a\nsolution with minimal top-down oversight. Interdependencies between the\nvarious teams are managed through frequent meetings and any rework is accepted\nas part of the iterative process. Upon completion of the immediate task, teams\neither dissolve or take on a new project. When it works well, it yields a\nheady mix of autonomy, immediate and measurable accomplishment, as well as a\nsense of team cohesion.\n\nThe logic behind extending Agile to entire organisations is that they\nincreasingly face conditions very similar to those of software organisations:\nthe pressure to excel at rapid search and to be egalitarian, in a bid to keep\nknowledge workers motivated. Therefore, the argument goes, we should do what\nthey (seem to) do successfully, which is Agile.\n\nAs we see it, there are three problems with this argument. First, the\nimportance of good old-fashioned execution relative to search varies a lot\nacross sectors. Not all are as search-intensive as software development.\nSecond, we are not sure these practices work as effectively outside software\ndevelopment, even for search problems. Third, even in the software industry,\nthe evidence that Agile practices can be scaled effectively is still thin.\n\nSpeeding through rapid parallel development is a chimera unless the pieces can\ntruly be worked on in parallel. Production technologies vary enormously in\nthis regard (a property known as \u201cdecomposability\u201d). All that parallel\nsprinting can end in a crash at the finish line unless the pieces fit\ntogether. There is no obvious reason to trust that the degree of\ndecomposability in, say, life sciences R&D or new product design in FMCG will\nbe the same as in software production. Software architects carefully plan for\nmodular work by specifying interfaces and design rules that allow for this\nparallelism. They also have the good fortune of dealing with a technology that\nallows this to be reasonably transparent. With code, what you see is what it\ndoes. The rest of us must tread carefully.\n\nIt is possible that a day will come when all execution-related activity can be\nautomated (either with robotics or AI), leaving humans free to focus on pure\nsearch. This in turn may involve heavy reliance on computer simulations rather\nthan expensive real-world prototyping. On that day, Agile practices might be\nthe norm for every part of every organisation. We just don\u2019t think that day is\ntomorrow.\n\n**Where Agile practices may work well**\n\nSo, does this mean Agile won\u2019t work for you? No, only that you should be\ncareful. We suggest a \u201cconcentric circles\u201d approach to applying Agile, with\nsoftware development activities at the core. Cautious extension to other\nsearch-intensive domains that have many software attributes (low cost of\nprototyping, parallelism) may come next. Product design, ideation, technical\nproblem solving are good candidates.\n\nBut you can do more than just guess whether Agile may work for you. One of the\nexercises we assign to our **[Org\n2.0](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/organisation-design-based-\non-science-not-superstition-6531)** students is to design a prototyping\nexperiment \u2013 with properly randomised treatment and control groups \u2013 to\ngenerate evidence that Agile practices can work in a particular organisational\ncontext. One low-cost way to run such an experiment is gamification. Think of\nan activity that could be run over a few hours or days (and potentially shares\ncritical similarities with your employees\u2019 usual work environment), randomly\ndivide your employees into \u201chierarchical\u201d and \u201cAgile\u201d teams, and analyse which\ngroup did better and why. Our colleague [**Maria\nGuadalupe**](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/maria-guadalupe)\nis soon launching a course on how to get Agile right, which should be very\nvaluable too.\n\n**The appeal of autonomy**\n\nWe speculate that the promise of autonomy and hierarchy-free organising (and\nresulting employee engagement) may also be an important driver of widespread\ninterest in Agile. We have [**written\nbefore**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/how-to-make-corporate-\nhierarchy-more-likable-7761) [**about\nthis**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/are-bosses-becoming-\nextinct-3357) and our basic viewpoint has not changed: As of today, we still\ndon\u2019t know of any robust, broadly applicable mechanism besides hierarchy for\nscaling collaboration among a diverse set of interdependent individuals. Yes,\nthere may be more delegation than before, **[better tools than the simple org\nchart to design hierarchies](https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-\norganisations/is-it-time-to-retire-the-org-chart-10151)** , and more attempts\nto mute the observable differences in status across layers, but the basic\nmulti-layered hierarchical framework is still the one that seems to work in\nthe broadest set of circumstances.\n\nA close examination of prominent exceptions (and there aren\u2019t so many) reveals\nthat they operate under some fairly exceptional circumstances. The idea that\nwe can take an existing set of employees and production technology and\nseamlessly reorganise them into a non-hierarchical structure has, at this\npoint, almost no evidence to support it. We fervently wish it weren\u2019t so,\nbeing egalitarians ourselves. And we should certainly keep trying to find a\nrobust and scalable alternative to hierarchy, because a preference for\nautonomy and a dislike of inequality are both important and widely held\nvalues. But Agile as it stands today is unlikely to be that solution.\n\n**_[Phanish Puranam](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/phanish-\npuranam)_** _is an INSEAD Professor of Strategy and the Roland Berger Chaired\nProfessor of Strategy and Organisation Design._\n\n_**[Julien Cl\u00e9ment](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-\nresearch/faculty/julien-clement)** is an Assistant Professor of Organisational\nBehaviour at the Stanford Graduate School of Business._\n\n_Follow INSEAD Knowledge on\n**[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/inseadknowledge) **and\n**[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Knowledge.insead)**._\n\nRelated articles\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2017/09/can_we_fix_hierarchy.jpg?itok=OdGsO6Eb)\n\n[Can We Fix Hierarchy?](/blog/insead-blog/can-we-fix-hierarchy-7176)\n\nSeptember 15, 2017\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2017/02/istock-182469157.jpg?itok=jbUc0su3)\n\n[Strategy as Hypothesis](/blog/insead-blog/strategy-as-hypothesis-5216)\n\nFebruary 16, 2017\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2017/02/istock-616902766.jpg?itok=Igt_Qo8P)\n\n[Innovating at the Intersections](/blog/insead-blog/innovating-at-the-\nintersections-5200)\n\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\nComments\n\nJeremy Renwick, 23.11.2018 at 06.11 pm\n\n[A broadly applicable alternative to the functional hierarchy ](/blog/insead-\nblog/why-agile-may-be-fragile-10201#comment-18631)\n\n\"As of today, we still don\u2019t know of any robust, broadly applicable mechanism\nbesides hierarchy for scaling collaboration among a diverse set of\ninterdependent individuals\"  \n  \nI suggest you take a look at the Adaptive Organisation\nhttps://agilesphere.eu/whitepaper/adaptive-organisation/  \n\n[](/comment/reply/10201/18631 \"Reply\")\n\nHartmut Goetze, 16.01.2019 at 10.54 am\n\n[How Fragile Develops and How to Avoid It](/blog/insead-blog/why-agile-may-be-\nfragile-10201#comment-19446)\n\nThank you, Phanish Puranam and Julien Cl\u00e9ment, for a perspective on the Agile\nhype.

Losing talent is a\ndisaster for digital-age organizations striving to attract and retain top\ntalent.  \n  \nHow come, something so simple to understand as the popular agile frameworks,\nunderpinned with inspiring and proven success stories, cannot be adopted by\nthe \u201crest of us\u201d?  \n  \nIn my practice as a transformation leader, I have seen a few Agile\ntransformation attempts. Here are some prominent peculiarities of some not so\nfortunate transformation initiatives:  \n  \n(MISTAKE 1) Simplistic promises such as \u201ccomplete twice the work in half the\ntime\u201d are taken literally. This creates the expectation that Agile is an\nefficiency booster that enables the workers to shoulder \u201cmore of the same\u201d.\nBut that is not the way how Agile creates value.  \n  \n(MISTAKE 2) Agile is perceived as a set of practices that can be rolled out\nacross an organization. That rarely works because the value of Agile does not\nemerge from pre-defined instructions, rules, organizational structures, roles\nand processes. Nevertheless, practices are a valuable constituent of Agile.\nMore on that below.  \n  \n(MISTAKE 3) The agile framework is not being properly adapted to the context\nto which it is applied. Considering, for example, the product, the\norganization or the market. Adaptation is hard without understanding the\ndeeper mechanics of the framework. In other words: The WHY behind the\nframework is not understood. The framework\u2019s prescriptions are followed\nreligiously in a \u201ccargo cult\u201d-manner hoping for the magic to happen.  \n  \n(MISTAKE 4) A new set of rules and processes is pushed down without having\nengaged the affected people beforehand. Real participation in decision making\ndidn\u2019t happen. There is little to no buy-in from the workforce. Therefore, the\nmost powerful impact-booster is absent. The general attitude is: \u201cLeadership\nonce again claims to know what is best for all of us\u201d. Which is why the\nworkforce is passively enduring just another change-initiative. Participation,\nhowever, is the heart of Agile. Not only in decision making, but also in\ncreating new solutions. In a broader sense, we can call this co-creation. Co-\ncreation thrives where classic decision processes get stuck. Co-creatively\ncrafted solutions can be realized with an impact that push-down change cannot\nachieve. You could call co-creation the most powerful high-performance tool\nthere is. Without engaged people, this tool cannot be applied. Unfortunately,\nthe popular agile frameworks provide no guidance whatsoever how such an\nengagement can be achieved. The popular change management approaches, by the\nway, also have no answer for this. And this is the main reason, why so many\nAgile transformations fail to get results.  \n  \n(MISTAKE 5) Agile is indiscriminately applied for all workstreams, regardless\nof the underlying problem class. That creates unnecessary overhead because\nproblems in the simple domain usually can be solved with established practices\nand with a predictive management style. Agile, however, thrives in complex\nproblem domains with high degrees of uncertainty. See the Stacey Matrix for\nexample, as a tool for classifying problems.  \n  \nLeaving the common mistakes aside, what do we see when we examine the\navailable success cases of agile transformations? We usually detect the\nemergence of new mindsets, a deeply engaged workforce and a raised level of\nself-management.  \n  \nPhanish Puranam\u2019s and Julien Cl\u00e9ment\u2019s define agile frameworks as a group of\nrapid, parallel search algorithms using cross-functional teams for product\ndevelopment in an egalitarian fashion. This definition, however, only partly\nexplains the often quantum-leap results of the available success cases.  \n  \nFurthermore, with Agile approaches, we can create more than just products and\nservices. Business models, organizational structures, processes and rules are\nbeing conceived. And implemented and optimized faster using Agile. Customers\nare being impressed by real business agility. Where flexibility and speed are\na core requirement, they are often willing to pay a premium price.  \n  \nSo how can we start a journey to real business agility?  \n  \nIt helps to clarify what we want to change in our organizations. How about\nthis: Let\u2019s improve the way decisions are being made. Let those people decide\nwho are best equipped for making the call. Of course, in co-creation with the\ntactical and strategic thinkers. What we get are decisions that are: (a)\nbetter and (b) executed with more impact.  \n  \nDecision making in traditional hierarchies suffers from well-known\nshortcomings such as: sub-optimal coordination across organizational silos,\ninflexibility / rigidity, single-point information-flow control causing\nbottlenecks and Chinese Whispers-effects and decision delays. Agile enhances\nthe capabilities of hierarchies in these regards. And without necessarily\ngetting rid of hierarchies altogether.  \n  \nAgile improves the value streams by focussing all contributors at value\ncreation. Not by poster messages such as \u201cwe are \u2026 focussed on customer value\n& take initiative\u201d, which as a mere lip-services achieves nothing. But by\ninstilling new ways of decision making. In the way of co-creation.  \n  \nHow do we do this in practice?  \n  \nOne effective, easy-to-start-with technique is called \u201cDelegation Poker\u201d. Find\ndetails in Jurgen Appelo\u2019s \u201cManagement 3.0\u201d (Addison-Wesley, 2010). Here is a\n5-minute video introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZF-G7MCSG4 A\nmanager \u201cnegotiates\u201d with her team who is authorized to make which decision.\nAnd how. This is not meant as a one-time event but is being continually\nadapted to the ever-changing realities.  \n  \nThe Delegation Poker method also demonstrates that Agile is not about getting\nrid of hierarchies. We still need leadership. For example, for providing rules\nabout how the organization (\u201cthe system\u201d) can grow and where the boundaries of\nself-management are. Some decisions should be delegated to lower levels of the\nhierarchy. Others shouldn\u2019t. Such clear rules and boundaries are required for\nresponsibility and engagement to grow.  \n  \nAnd what is more: Simply by engaging people in Delegation Poker, we showcase a\nliving example of a highly engaging way of collaboration. This evokes\nengagement, responsibility and courage. And all this happens in a very\ncontrolled manner.  \n  \nAnother nice side-effect: invisible electric fences, into which particularly\nthe motivated employees used to run into, disappear.  \n  \nDelegation Poker broadcasts an important message: \u201cWe do take the Agile\ntransformation seriously. Watch us transforming our management work.\u201d This\nsignal encourages the workforce to engage and consider deep change rather than\nsimply complying with leadership\u2019s demands.  \n  \nDespite its controlled nature, this approach alone already raises the level of\nautonomy of each single employee. And autonomy is one of the drivers of high\nperformance as described by Daniel H. Pink in \u201cDrive: The Surprising Truth\nAbout What Motivates Us\u201d (Riverhead Books, reprint edition 2011).  \n  \nTo make this very clear: The purpose of Agile is not to abolish hierarchy.\nAgility requires governance. Clear rules and well-managed boundaries of self-\nmanagement. The purpose of Agile is to better align decisions with the value\nstreams. Also, to execute faster and with more discipline.  \n  \nIn conclusion: While there is usually a decent understanding of the desired\nbenefits of Agile, it remains often unclear how to take an organization to the\nentirely new level of collaboration and co-creation. Before starting any\ntransformation initiative, we need to set up a proven way to engage the\nworkforce as the very basis of the high-performance we desire. Such engagement\ncannot be commanded, however. As a good starting point, a method called\nDelegation Poker can be used to arouse an initial rise of workforce\nengagement.  \n  \nThere are more holistic approaches available for conducting Agile\ntransformations with a very high success-rate, such as Daniel Mezick\u2019s Open\nSpace Agility. Further advantages are faster and more wide-spread growth of\nagility. See http://openspaceagility.com/at-a-glance/ We don\u2019t go into detail\nhere.  \n  \nIt remains to be said that Agile is nothing new. At all times organizations\nhave been working in Agile ways. What has changed is this: The rewards for\nbusiness agility have grown exponentially.  \n  \nThe often cited VUCA-argument, however, is not true for every industry, every\nmarket, and every stage of a product\u2019s lifecycle. To ensure that we really\nneed to fundamentally change our way of working, we need to analyse the class\nof problems and the dynamics of the underlying systems so that we don\u2019t apply\nexcellent tools in a wrong way, which can damage the tool as well as the hand\nholding it.  \n  \nResponsibility without passion leads to rigidity. Passion without\nresponsibility rarely gets much done. We need to grow both passion and\nresponsibility. Engaging the people is key here. Agile is more of an outcome\nthan a method of achieving this. Beware of Agile frameworks that claim that it\nis sufficient to follow its rules by the book to create a high-performing\norganization.  \n  \nFinally, best success to Maria Guadalupe with launching a course on how to get\nAgile right. I am excited to learn more about this.  \n  \nApologies for a comment that is longer than the underlying article. I hope\nsome of these thoughts can help the reader to start her journey to explore\nauthentic agility.  \n\n[](/comment/reply/10201/19446 \"Reply\")\n\nAdd a comment Already a member?

manage or\nperform an information security gap analysis to find potential security\nvulnerabilities and risks and to use the information to implement solutions to\nbridge the gaps. The goal: to continually improve and move closer to the\ndesired security position, and to transition security from its current state\nto its future improved state. Several critical steps in the process must\nalways be addressed when conducting a useful gap analysis. Let\u2019s look at them!\n\n## Why a gap analysis is important\n\n![gap\nanalysis](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22297%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nA gap analysis can be performed for various reasons. Generally, no matter the\nbackground, it is a tool used for improving the state of something \u2014 to raise\nthe performance level of the particular area in question. As a general tool,\nit can be used at different levels. Also, it can be centered on different\nperspectives, such as organizational, business process, business direction,\nand technology perspectives.\n\nAn information security gap analysis is an excellent way for an organization\nto understand where to focus its security efforts for maximum security\nimprovement. Additionally, it\u2019s often a compliance requirement, to obtain and\nmaintain compliance with a particular standard or regulation. However, this is\nnot the only reason for performing one. A primary purpose is to help\norganizations uncover risks and vulnerabilities and to improve their\ninformation security posture ultimately.\n\nFor every gap analysis, the process should include describing the **scope** or\nthe area to be analyzed, identifying the **improvement areas** , defining the\n**targets** , identifying the **current state** and devising a **plan of\naction** or steps to achieve the desired **future state.**\n\n### Step 1: Define the scope, choose a security standard or benchmark\n\n_**Scope**_\n\nThis essential step in the process is important for many reasons. Most\norganizations encompass a multitude of processes, departments, and functions.\nSo, it is crucial to define the **scope** or identify the area that needs\ninvestigation. This helps to maintain the focus of the investigation; it\nprovides clarity to keep everyone aligned and on track and ultimately helps to\nencourage an efficient gap analysis investigation.\n\nDepending on the organization, the available resources and its objective, the\nscope of the gap analysis can vary. One organization may choose to evaluate\nits entire security program from the get-go. Another may select a particular\narea to consider first. Or sometimes evaluating a particular segment\ninitially, is a way to save on resources, cost and time (smaller businesses\nmay consider this approach). By doing this, a section could be used to\nrepresent the overall security program, and the outcome of the gap analysis on\nthat particular segment could describe the likely outcome of the rest of the\nsecurity program in place. So, the result of this initial investigation will\naffect the investigations going forward. This is dependent on the\norganization, its processes, set up and the policies, frameworks and the\nsecurity that is already implemented.\n\n![security](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22606%22%20height%3D%22320%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nOnce the scope has been identified, you need to look a little deeper. The\n**key improvement areas** within the scope must be determined. Once the key\nareas have been identified, **targets** need to be set for each one to realize\nthe improvement that is required. Benchmarking, analysis, and investigations\nare essential to this.\n\nSo, the **targets** you set will depend on variables specific to your\norganization. Variables such as the resources and time available to dedicate\nto the process. The degree of preparation already done before the gap analysis\nis performed. If and to what degree the organization\u2019s (or area in question)\nexisting program **(current state)** is benchmarked to a particular standard\nor best practices. So, consideration needs to be made for what has already\nbeen achieved.\n\n_**Benchmarking**_\n\nThis is when **benchmarking** becomes important. It is necessary so that the\norganization can make better-informed decisions. Again, how you go about this\ndepends on the organization, the resources available and the objectives. If\nthe gap analysis is purely for internal reasons, for example, the organization\nwants to improve its security posture, or if it is a\n[compliance](http://techgenix.com/effective-compliance-plan/) or regulatory\nrequirement, the type of benchmarking will differ. Usually, to obtain or\nmaintain certification, performing a gap analysis against a particular\nsecurity standard is required.\n\nWhen comparing an organization\u2019s existing security program with industry\nsecurity best practices, [industry standards or security\nframeworks](http://techgenix.com/frameworks-and-standards/) help to do this.\nSo, a key step in the process may be to choose a security standard to work\nwith if you do not use one already.\n\nHowever, other benchmarking may include looking at actions that other\norganizations have taken or use industry best practices. Considering the\nexperience and knowledge of peers in the same space is also often used.\nCrowdsourcing experience and expertise are valuable and beneficial for smaller\nbusinesses, in particular, those with limited resources. By understanding how\nother businesses facing similar challenges control them, you accumulate data\nand knowledge that could be put to practice in your own business. With a broad\nview from multiple scenarios, the information gained can be assimilated and be\nvery useful to a smaller business when uncovering and managing risk.\nUltimately, the aim should be to benchmark the security program to key best\npractices or universally recognized security standards.\n\nStandards have been developed from years of research into the risks, threats,\nand adequate controls to help address these. These standards are very\nbeneficial to benchmark organization security controls against as they are\nproven effective if correctly implemented and followed.\n\n![gap\nanalysis](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22333%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nShutterstock\n\nGenerally, the ISO/IEC 27002:2013 standard provides a good benchmark. It gives\nguidelines for organizational information security standards and information\nsecurity management practices for selecting, implementing and managing\ncontrols while considering the information security risk environment of the\norganization. It\u2019s a good choice for organizations using ISO/IEC 27001\nInformation Security Management System or organizations implementing\nuniversally accepted information security controls or those organizations that\nwant to develop their own unique set of security management strategies. It\noffers this flexibility and covers the primary security areas that must be\naddressed as part of the process.\n\nThey work well together. The ISO 27000 family of standards encompasses\ninformation security best practices. [ISO\n27001](http://techgenix.com/iso-27001-certification/) is great for designing\nand planning an information security management system implementation\nframework. However, [ISO 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html)\noffers detailed advice on how to handle information security risks in line\nwith the controls already implemented and guides how to implement further\ncontrols, highlighted in ISO 27001, to combat risk. Universally recognized\nsecurity standards can provide a systematic approach to adopt best practice\ncontrols, quantify the risk and level that is acceptable and implement\neffective and appropriate measures to improve security.\n\nBenchmarking against a standard like this helps to compare the organization\u2019s\nprocesses, policies, and controls against others in a focused manner and helps\nto avoid overlooking essential aspects.\n\nWhichever benchmarking approach is decided upon, the methodology, resources,\nstandards, and best practices must be agreed before starting the investigation\nprocess.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the best resource for the job\n\nThis is a sticking point for some. Larger organizations tend to have security\nteams in-house, dedicated to all aspects of the business\u2019s security. In this\ncase, the resources are usually readily available for this type of task.\nHowever, smaller organizations typically have security as an add-on to a small\nIT team, no team dedicated to security. Some may not even have an IT team, but\nrather an IT person that does it all. Some may contract help when needed. No\nmatter the organization\u2019s size or circumstances, to improve security\nprospects, a gap analysis remains important.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes more difficult for smaller businesses with limited resources to\neffectively and continuously plan and strategize for the future because of\ntheir resource limitations. For smaller businesses getting outside help and\nadvice is probably best. Always ensure the resources enlisted are experienced\nand reputable.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22768%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nFor organizations that do have the resources, a gap analysis can be done using\ninternal people unless a regulatory requirement says otherwise. However, it\u2019s\nrecommended, and sometimes compulsory, to have an independent or unbiased\nresource conduct the gap analysis. A new and impartial set of eyes often sees\nthings that internal people (working with the processes and with the security\noperations daily) will miss.\n\nWhichever approach the organization chooses, results must be reported in a way\nto highlight risks, recommendations and compliance requirements in a neutral\nand all-encompassing way. Only then can a realistic view and understanding of\nthe risk exposure and security control inadequacies be uncovered most\naccurately.\n\nIt\u2019s important to get management\u2019s uptake. After all, the results of the\nanalysis will be used by execs and management to make vital decisions\nregarding the business and its security moving forward.\n\nThe quantity of your gap analyses is less important than the quality. Doing a\npoor job on a regular basis does not improve the outcome, but doing a thorough\njob less often (on an annual basis) will give you reliable results to work\nwith for the year ahead. So, get the support of leadership, use the best\npeople for the job, and make the effort count.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze, investigate, gather and collate\n\nPart of the process is to evaluate people, process, and technology as all of\nthese elements impact and effect information security within the organization.\nTo asses these elements various methods can be used, but all involve gathering\nintelligence and data. It\u2019s a learning exercise to determine the\norganization\u2019s **current security state** relevant to these aspects and its\nfunctional (or not) existing security practices.\n\n![Changing US Employee Workforce - What CIOs Need to\nKnow](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22768%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)  \nYou will need to investigate existing security policies, controls, and\nprocesses, organizational charts and functioning, application and data\ninventories and interview employees, etc. Consider the following: hardware and\nsoftware inventories, data classifications, access controls, system\nmaintenance logs, software settings and back up procedures.\n\nA lot of the time security risk involves people \u2014 human error. User behavior\nneeds to be investigated and appropriately addressed. This is why interviewing\nemployees is necessary. You need to gain an understanding of their knowledge\nand their effectiveness at securely following the processes in place. This\nneeds to be demonstrated. In this instance, the process is a security control\nrather than technology.\n\nExisting documentation needs to be reviewed. All of this evaluation is\nnecessary to gauge the most accurate risk profile of the organization.\n\nThrough investigation and data gathering, the goal is to understand better how\nthe existing security program functions. This gives you a clear view of the\nenvironment, the existing protection, and the effectiveness of the current\nsecurity. By comparing the existing controls to best practice controls or\nthose advised in the chosen standard, the gaps, weaknesses, and\nvulnerabilities become apparent. Also, missing security controls can be\nidentified as well as any that are immature or incomplete.\n\nStay informed based on data collected and facts, rather than speculation. Look\nat people, processes and technology and how they fit together, work together\nand impact one another to reduce or increase security risk. Consider how\ntechnology and services work. How processes work and what is expected of them.\nLook at how they fit into the security program. What their impact on security\nis. Are they working appropriately? Are they incurring risk? Leave no stone\nunturned!\n\nEvaluate and collate data. Prepare reports and documentation to demonstrate\nthe current controls in place and the level of maturity for each.\nAdditionally, show the potential impact if the improvement is not made. This\nstep helps an organization to visualize the security state and prioritize the\nissues to remediate first.\n\nUnderstand the **current state** of security. This is as important as\nunderstanding where you want to get to **(future state)**. You can\u2019t fully\nachieve the desired improved state without knowing the state you are starting\nat. To visualize progress and to design a realistic action plan, this is\nvital.\n\nWith a clear and concise view of the organization\u2019s current security profile\nand the strengths and weaknesses and areas where improvement is needed, a\nsuitable action plan can be developed.\n\n### Step 4: Devise the action plan\n\nThe plan of action you devise will be the steps necessary to close the gaps to\nrealize the improved **future state** of security. It\u2019s important to\nprioritize these and define a realistic time scale in which to achieve each.\nDepending on security maturity, this will be different for every organization\nand will take more or less time to fulfill.\n\nThere are various ways to approach it too, maybe prioritizing the most\ncritical gaps first or tackling the ones that are most simple to close first.\nAgain, this is unique to the organization and its circumstances and objectives\nfor the short and long term. Be careful to not rush the \u201cgap-closing\u201d process\neither. It may be that some gaps are connected and are easier to remediate\nwith a single control, but rushing the process could potentially put too much\npressure on the organization and gaps may be poorly closed or, worse, not\nclosed at all.\n\nPrioritizing by having targets and time-scales for each is very important.\nMake sure to follow the plan that you agree and devise \u2014 routinely come back\nto it to make sure you keep on track.\n\nThe action plan should include risks, resources (staff and budget), and\ntimeframes to achieve the targets to improve the security posture.\n\nGain acceptance and plan the way forward. This is why management uptake is so\nimportant. If you remember one of the first recommendations was to get\nmanagement support and commitment from the start. This is essential to the\nsuccess of any plan you decide upon.\n\n## Gap analysis: A strategic tool with multiple benefits\n\nAlthough gap analyses are common\n[assessments](http://techgenix.com/cybersecurity-assessments-and-audits/),\nlike everything else, they should be carried out correctly to realize the full\nbenefits and to obtain the best results. If performed successfully, this\nstrategic tool can provide organizations with value in many ways. It can show\nthe organization its current security state and reflects the key steps and\ndirection to focus security efforts on when devising an action plan to achieve\nan improved future security state.\n\n_Featured image: Shutterstock_\n\nPost Views:  298\n\n* ## Featured Links\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://www.ezoic.com/what-is-\nezoic/)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%2287%22%20height%3D%2218%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)report\nthis ad  \n\n##### Read Next\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n[Home](http://techgenix.com/) \u00bb [Security](http://techgenix.com/security/) \u00bb\nSecurity gap analysis: Four-step guide to find and fix vulnerabilities\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22200%22%20height%3D%22200%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nAuthor\n\n#### Monique Magalhaes\n\nMonique Magalhaes is a DP Executive and facilitator of data protection and\ninformation governance at Galaxkey, a company specialising in data protection\nand security solutions.

An organization chart [published by The\nInformation](https://www.theinformation.com/the-people-with-power-at-\namazon?eu=fwf56HXzFzOt_dQAlopS3A) (paywall) shows only four women reporting to\nthe executives who report to Bezos. That means women make up just five of the\n59 executives The Information identified at the highest levels of Amazon. The\nchart also identifies the 17 members of the senior team, or S-team, who serve\nas Bezos\u2019s core group of advisors. Galetti is the only woman in that group,\ntoo.\n\nNote: the chart is incomplete, as it doesn\u2019t show the direct reports to\nGaletti or David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s general counsel. It\u2019s likely that at least\nsome of their lieutenants are women. Meanwhile, The Information shows Bezos\nwith 10 direct reports but one, Diego Piacentini, [is on\nsabbatical](https://qz.com/797428/one-of-amazons-top-executives-is-going-to-\nwork-in-italys-public-sector-for-free/) while serving in a pro-bono government\npost in Italy.\n\nAmazon declined to comment when Quartz asked the company to explain why there\nare so few women in senior positions. But we can make educated guesses about\nsome of the possible reasons for its lopsided gender split:\n\n## The tech sector doesn\u2019t hire and promote enough women\n\nIn a tally of some of the biggest tech companies\u2019 2016 [annual diversity\nreports](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-\ntech/), none were at gender parity and among the top five\u2014Amazon, Apple,\nFacebook, Google and Microsoft\u2014women made up less than 40% of the workforce.\nAmong managers, there are even fewer women, and Amazon says [just 25% of its\nleaders](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=10080092011) are women. As a whole, the\nindustry has a woeful record of recruiting, hiring, and retaining women at all\nlevels.\n\n## There\u2019s a lack of turnover among Amazon\u2019s upper ranks\n\nThe average tenure among Bezos\u2019 senior team is 15 years. Given that the\ncompany is just 23 years old, it means many were hired when Amazon was still\nrelatively small, and Bezos was more likely to rely on personal acquaintances\nand connections. Entrepreneurs swear by referrals as a recruiting tool, but\nwhen founders hire the people they and their inner circle know, it [inevitably\nperpetuates](https://qz.com/67830/employee-referral-programs-are-making-the-\nworkplace-a-lot-whiter/) a lack of diversity in an organization.\n\n## Amazon culture\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Amazon\u2019s[ sharp-elbowed\nculture](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-\nwrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html) and punishing schedule,\nwhich historically include expectations of being available at all hours. While\nthe company has made efforts to improve [work-life\nbalance](https://qz.com/768937/amazon-known-for-its-soul-crushing-work-\nculture-is-testing-a-30-hour-workweek/) for its employees, those demands would\nbe felt most acutely by women with young families, making them more likely to\nleave the company in search of more flexibility. That means Amazon may have\nlost a generation of women who would now be in position to become senior\nleaders.\n\n _ **Update:** Amazon provided the following statement: \u201cWe have female VPs\nacross the company leading some of our most significant businesses \u2014 not\nincluding Beth Galetti, our SVP of HR. A few examples include Maria Renz,\nwho\u2019s overseeing our delivery experience (she was previously Jeff Bezos\u2019\ntechnical advisor). Shelley Reynolds, Amazon\u2019s Worldwide Controller. Stephenie\nLandry, who conceived of, launched and now leads Prime Now. Cynthia Williams,\nleader of Fulfillment by Amazon. Christine Beauchamp, Amazon\u2019s VP of Fashion.\nThis is just a handful of the many women in significant roles at Amazon.\u201d None\nsave Galetti are members of Bezos\u2019s senior team._\n\n[![The Memo from Quartz at Work](https://cms.qz.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/quartz-at-work/)\n\n[\n\n##### The Memo from Quartz at Work\n\n](/emails/quartz-at-work/)\n\n##### Did you get The Memo?

You\u2019ll find stark differences. But if you want to be\nunderwhelmed, try comparing a company\u2019s organizational structure chart from\nthe same two years. Chances are, those two charts look pretty similar.\n\nSure, there are organizational outliers, like online shoe-seller Zappos, which\nfamously adopted \u201cholacracy,\u201d [a structure of no job titles and no\nbureaucracy](https://hbr.org/2016/07/beyond-the-holacracy-hype), giving teams\nthe power to reorganize themselves at will. But with few exceptions,\norganizational structure has failed to keep up with other market-fueled\ntechnological innovation. As a result, a lot of companies are stuck in a\nstructure rut, and aren\u2019t operating as smoothly as they could be.\n\n[\n\n#### Gallery: 10 Powerful Ways To Empower Your Employees\n\n10 images  View gallery\n](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/5716950da7ea43722d7811a2/10-powerful-ways-\nto-empow/)\n\nToday In: [Leadership](https://www.forbes.com/leadership)\n\n  * [\n\n### 6 Ways To Conquer Procrastination\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancamillercole/2020/04/08/6-ways-to-conquer-\nprocrastination/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Telehealth In Response To Pandemic May Change Healthcare Forever\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2020/04/08/telehealth-in-response-\nto-pandemic-may-change-healthcare-forever/)\n\n  * [\n\n### The Key To Decisive Action At Defining Moments Like This One\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminkomlos/2020/04/08/the-key-to-decisive-\naction-at-defining-moments-like-this-one/)\n\n\u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve been in this cycle where an organization hires a\nconsulting firm to help design and execute a restructuring, and then, as soon\nas they\u2019re done, they start that process again,\u201d says Ethan Bernstein, an\nassistant professor in the Organizational Behavior unit at Harvard Business\nSchool, who spent five years as a management consultant at the Boston\nConsulting Group (BCG) before joining the HBS faculty. \u201cAnd so we have this\nsort of binge diet kind of process of restructuring organizations that really\nends up with no trend line.\u201d\n\nBernstein believes the key to breaking that cycle may lie in research\npartnerships that help organizations conduct more field experiments. Just as\nmany companies test out new products with \u201ca/b\u201d testing, they might also take\nan experimental approach to discovering the best organizational structure for\ntheir business.\n\n\u201cI think that most executives look at bold experiments like [CEO] Tony Hsieh\u2019s\nexperiment with holacracy at Zappos and think, wow, I\u2019d really like to\nexperiment with my organizational structure too, maybe not that radically, but\nwith the potential for a similarly large impact on how people work together\nproductively,\u201d Bernstein says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t know where to start, or, if\nthey do, all they see are roadblocks in the way.\u201d\n\nTo that end, he and several colleagues recently launched the [Harvard Business\nSchool Organizational Lab](https://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/the-o-\nlab/brief). A collaborative effort with the HBS Digital Initiative and the HBX\nLive virtual classroom, the o-Lab aims to help businesses solve their problems\nby changing the way their company is organized, and to make that change by\nintroducing a more theoretical and experimental approach to organizational\nrestructuring.\n\nAs things stand today, restructuring can feel like a \u201cjust because\u201d pursuit\namong companies, which often coincides with a change in C-suite leadership.\n\n\u201cIf you bring in an executive from the outside, it\u2019s very common that, as soon\nas they get into their chair, they want to reorganize,\u201d says Clayton\nChristensen, the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at HBS.\n\u201cThe fact that they keep doing it that way means that there\u2019s not a theory of\nthe organization. Nobody can say, \u2018In this situation, based on theory, this is\nthe way we should reorganize.\u2019 So there\u2019s a lot of waste that goes on, and\nopportunities that are not pursued.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the o-Lab is not out to question the value of business\nconsultants or CEOs. Rather, it aims to illustrate the value of the tools of\nbusiness research.\n\n\u201cIf we, the HBS faculty, are going to claim that we have theories about\norganizations that are practical and relevant for the parties who are running\nthose organizations, then we should try to see if we can break the cycle with\nsomething that lets an organization learn over time,\u201d Bernstein says. \u201cAnd\nthat would seem to be a more experimental approach than a planned approach.\u201d\n\n****\n\n**Crowdsourcing Research**\n\nEarlier this year, the o-Lab issued an open call for businesses to share\nchallenges that were difficult to overcome due to their current organizational\nstructures. Some 44 people submitted problems [via a platform that let\neveryone view everyone else\u2019s ideas\nonline](https://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/the-o-lab/challenges).\n\nOne submitter explained that her company was transitioning from producing\nboutique products for a few customers to more mainstream products for a wider\ncustomer base, and wondered how to reorganize her company\u2019s team structure\naccordingly. Another wanted to figure out how to maintain a culture of\nentrepreneurship among local offices as his company continued to grow\nglobally. Another, a seasoned lawyer, set out to evolve the organizational\nstructure of his firm.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of new technologies and the trend toward unbundling legal\nservices into their component parts means the structures traditionally used by\nlarge law firms are being increasingly challenged,\u201d says Robert Regan, a\npartner at Corrs Chambers Westgarth, a law firm in Sydney, Australia. \u201cTo\nrespond to this, and deal with falling margins, law firms need to find new\norganizing principles.\u201d\n\nIn March, Bernstein teamed up with Christensen to lead an online discussion,\nhosted by [HBX Live](http://hbx.hbs.edu/hbx-live), on how to design an\norganizational experiment. They started by making sure the participants\nunderstood the practical importance of theory. \u201cBehind every massive\nexperiment there\u2019s a theory,\u201d Bernstein says. (He notes that the majority of\ntoday\u2019s organizations are largely based on the theory of late nineteenth\ncentury economist Max Weber; it\u2019s called\n[bureaucracy](https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-\nsociology-textbook/social-groups-and-organization-6/bureaucracy-56/weber-s-\nmodel-for-bureaucracy-352-10202/).)\n\nAt the HBX Live event, Christensen explained why business practitioners should\ncare about theory in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe teach our students to be data-driven, fact-based, and analytical in their\ndecision-making processes,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cBut if data is only available\nabout the past, we\u2019re essentially teaching our students only to take action\nwhen the game is over. A better way to think about the problem is to be able\nto look into the future and predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future. And\nif there\u2019s no data, then the only way I can look into the future is if\nsomebody has given us a theory of causality. That allows us to say if we do\n_this_ , then _that_ will happen. So theory is of immense value to managers.\u201d\n\nFollowing the event, six participants submitted experiments for consideration,\nfour of which made it to the \u201crefinement\u201d stage, including Regan\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe hypothesis that we are testing is that if a complex legal brief is viewed\nfirstly as a bundle of tasks to be integrated to create a customer outcome,\nproductivity and collaboration will be improved,\u201d Regan says. \u201cIf this is\nestablished it could drive a reorganization of our existing organizational\nstructures.\u201d\n\nOther participants in the refinement stage include a health care professional,\nwho [proposed an experiment](https://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/the-o-\nlab/refinement/alliance-of-networked-teams-for-bundled-payments-in-health-\ncare) around the idea of \u201ccreating cross organizational teams that promote\ncollaboration and alignment in managing patient care,\u201d and an MIT lecturer,\nwho wants to test out expedient ways to [combine the best aspects of big data\nand crowdsourcing](https://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/the-o-\nlab/refinement/critical-decision-making-in-a-hostile-data-environment). They\nwill be reporting their progress for the next several weeks, inviting input\nfrom Bernstein, Christensen, HBS research associate Kathy Qu, and the rest of\nthe o-Lab community.\n\n**Problems And Potentials**\n\nNeither Bernstein nor Christensen is certain that the o-Lab will yield viable\nnew theories about organizational structure. Theories are statements of\ncausality, which help to predict the future outcomes of current actions. The\no-Lab experimenters may be more focused on immediate goals that are specific\nto an individual organization than on predictive outcomes that are\ngeneralizable to all organizations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of using field experiments for research\u2014it\u2019s never easy,\u201d\nBernstein says. \u201cIn research, field experiments fail at least as often as they\nsucceed. We\u2019re hoping our partners can help us do more of them _and_ make us\nbetter at them, all at the same time.\n\nThe challenge about this, to be frank, is that the theoretical reasons for\nconducting one experiment or another are going to be all over the map,\u201d\nBernstein says. \u201cPicking a goal target over a theoretical target always makes\nfor a more difficult synthesis. But that\u2019s the fun part too: taking a bunch of\ninteresting experiments and data and figuring out how to make it useful to us\nas a research institution and to us as organizational scholars.\u201d\n\nIn the process, Bernstein is convinced that business practitioners will\nbenefit from the mere idea of experimenting with organizational structure.\n\n\u201cToo many people assume their organization\u2019s structure is a given,\u201d he says,\nand then gestures to the heavy oak desk in his office. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the way I\nassume it\u2019s a given that I can\u2019t move this desk. So, I don\u2019t try. But if you\nwere to give me a desk made out of Legos, I might move the Legos around. I\u2019m\nkind of used to moving Legos around, because I have a three-and-a-half-year-\nold. So the o-Lab is about that: Gee, if we could break an assumption _and_\nprovide the tool kit _and_ get a community of support around it, maybe we\ncould get more experiments done, and we could make more progress as a result.\u201d\n\n**To Learn More About The o-Lab And The Creation Of Business Theories:**\n\n\u2022 [The Organization Lab (o-Lab): How might we create the next iteration of our\norganization?](https://medium.com/harvard-business-school-digital-\ninitiative/the-organization-lab-how-might-we-create-the-next-iteration-of-our-\norganizations-22a90695fea4#.57p97vao3) by Ethan Bernstein.\n\n\u2022 [What Is Disruptive Innovation?](https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-\ninnovation) By Clayton Christensen, Michael E.

Don\u2019t believe it.\nMaybe this will one day be the case, but it is not the case yet, and my\nexperience tells me that it won\u2019t be for at least another decade. Many\ncompanies\u2014including my own\u2014won\u2019t even look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or interview people who\ndon\u2019t include cover letters.\n\nThis is not to say that some hiring managers, jobs or professions rely less on\ncover letters than some others, but unless the job announcement specifically\nrequests that you leave the cover letter out, you really should take the time\nto include one whenever possible.\n\nThe cover letter is your opportunity to convert your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 into a story about\nhow you are uniquely positioned to address the organization\u2019s needs. It helps\nyou stand out from the crowd and promote the best of what you offer for a\nspecific position within a specific organization. It is also an opportunity to\nshow the prospective employer your writing skills, your ability to\npersuasively communicate a concise message and your professionalism and\nwillingness to put forth a little extra effort. If you want your cover letter\nto land you the interview and increase\u2014rather than reduce\u2014your perceived\nvalue, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the following guidelines.\n\n## **To whom should you address the cover letter?**\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nThis is not the time for laziness. Make a sincere effort to find the name of\nthe individual for whom the position reports, and use that name and title in\nthe letter. Sometimes, the person you should address the letter to is actually\nlisted directly in the job announcement, but often it isn\u2019t. When you can\u2019t\ndetermine the person from the job announcement, start digging. Start with the\ncompany\u2019s website, and check for the division, department or unit that the\nposition works. Maybe you can see a department head\u2019s name there. Also, check\nfor any organization charts to see if you can learn the name there. You could\neven call the organization directly to ask for the name of the hiring manager\nor supervisor for the position that has been posted.\n\nIf you still have no luck, locate the human resource executive or manager from\nthe HR section of the website, and address the letter to that person. If all\nelse fails, address your letter to the company\u2019s CEO. Though your position may\nnot directly report to this person, indirectly it will because everyone in an\norganization ultimately works for the CEO.\n\nThe key point here is to address your letter to a human being. Address it to a\nreal person who works in the organization, and the closer you can get to the\nposition, the better.\n\n## **How long should your cover letter be?**\n\nJust as with [an effective resignation\nletter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/09/08/how-to-write-a-\nsimple-and-effective-resignation-letter/#5a6a99424d10), your cover letter\nshould typically be one page or less so go in with the idea to draft the best\nnarrative you can in as few words as possible. You need to include the\nnarrative that best advances your message, and eliminate redundancies or\nduplicate content that can be found verbatim on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nThe cover letter should serve as an enhancer to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a supplemental\nmarketing or promotional tool. It shouldn\u2019t just restate everything on your\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n## **What should your cover letter include?**\n\nYou cover letter should include approximately three or four paragraphs. What\nworks for most job applicants is an introductory paragraph, the body of the\nletter and a closing paragraph.\n\n### The introductory paragraph:\n\nThis is where you indicate the position for which you are applying and how you\nlearned about it. If you were referred by a company employee or some notable\nfigure to the organization, go ahead and do a name drop in this first\nparagraph. [_The Muse_](https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-\ncover-letter-examples) provides some examples of attention-grabbing openers\nthat help your cover letter stand out from crowd and ensure it doesn\u2019t sound\ncookie cutter.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to include a sentence or two in this first paragraph to\ndescribe what aspect of the job matters most to you and how you\u2019d immediately\nfocus your attention to lighten the load or burdens of the team, the\nsupervisor or the organization. The goal here is to pique the reader\u2019s\ninterest and compel him or her to read more. These details send the message\nthat you have really done your homework. You want to show that you understand\nthe strategic aspects of the job and how your background and experience make\nyou uniquely qualified to deliver.\n\n### The body of the letter:\n\nYou will want about two paragraphs here or one paragraph and graphics, lists,\netc. Focus your message on the employer\u2019s needs (not your own). The cover\nletter should tell a compelling story for how you are best positioned to make\nimmediate contributions and address the employer\u2019s challenges and concerns.\nBased on the job announcement and other details you learn after conducting\nresearch about the company, figure out how you could stand out from the\ncompetition. Use your cover letter to tell the hiring manager about the value\nyou can bring to alleviate the organization\u2019s pain points, advance its\nstrategic priorities, increase performance outcomes and support a high-\nperformance culture.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to old rules that call for nothing but paragraphs. You\ncan include creative formatting whereby your letter presents information in\nparagraph form as well as column, table, bullets or boxes. It\u2019s okay to add\nsome eye candy that will draw the reader in on a special point or specific\npiece of information that you want to be sure he or she can\u2019t possibly miss.\nTo highlight your understanding of the organization\u2019s strategy, its current\nsuccesses and challenges, its operating model or organizational structure,\netc., you could get away from regular narrative and use promotional design\ntools like boxes, tables, charts, graphs or columns to make your point. These\ntools are also great for emphasizing quantifiable data or metrics to\ndemonstrate major successes.\n\n### The closing paragraph:\n\nThis is where you remind the reader that you are prepared to make immediate\ncontributions to the team in a specific area or two and then express that you\nwelcome a meeting to share more about your background and learn more about the\nposition. Finally, tell the reader that you appreciate his or her time, and\ngive the details for how you can be reached.\n\nClose it with something like \u201csincerely\u201d or \u201crespectfully\u201d and then put your\nname and the enclosure notation to indicate that you are including your r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nand any other material you will be attaching.\n\n## **What shouldn\u2019t be included in your cover letter?**\n\nHere are a few things you really should not include in the cover letter.\n\n  * Again, don\u2019t copy and paste sections of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You can highlight specific skills, but the cover letter is where you embrace and communicate the value that your talents, education and experience provide for the specific position you are seeking. Your cover letter\u2019s purpose is to weave a narrative your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn\u2019t so resist all temptation to just copy and paste the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on different paper.\n  * Don\u2019t include your home address in full. It\u2019s not necessary, and there is too much risk to doing so. People are stealing identities and violating the privacy of others. If you must include anything about your address, stick with your city and state only. You can provide your full address as you advance in the process as a candidate.\n  * Don\u2019t include any references within your cover letter, and don\u2019t bother adding the statement that says \u201creferences upon request.\u201d If you move along in the process as a candidate, you can give this information at a more appropriate time.\n  * Don\u2019t leave typos or grammatical errors in your cover letter. Check this again and again, and after you have proofread it three or four times, have someone else proof it for you if you can.\n\n## Yes, you really should include a cover letter.\n\nIn times where you don\u2019t have the ability or time to include a cover letter,\neither ask a friend or hire someone. Unless the job posting specifically\ndirects you to exclude a cover letter, you really should include it. Also,\nsome jobs or companies are more lenient about cover letters than others. If\nyou really have decided that you absolutely don\u2019t want to do the work to\ninclude a cover letter, and the job posting doesn\u2019t specifically say to leave\nit out, give the company a call and ask if they have a preference.\n\nMost people actually don\u2019t take the time to add a cover letter, and many\nothers don\u2019t take the time to ensure their letters add value to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and\nelevate them as candidates. It\u2019s up to you to use your best judgment to decide\nwhether to move forward without the cover letter.

Some days\nthe numbers look fine, and other days they just don't add up. Variation is a\nmanager's natural enemy, making it more difficult to sort out what's really\ngoing on, make valid predictions, and be in control. But few managers are\nequipped to deal properly with variation.\n\nTo fully understand what your data is telling you, you must sort out variation\nand what is causing it. You must acknowledge that variation is important and\ntake it into account. As you dive into the numbers, aim to understand the\nsources of variation. Then, consider these sources as you gain a feel for\nmeasurements of variation, including standard deviation and R-squared.\nUnderstanding variation is not that difficult, and it puts a powerful tool in\nyour data science quiver.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/08/Aug19_16_1069793558.jpg)\nDNY59/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/08/do-you-understand-the-variance-in-your-\ndata?language=es)\n\nIt is easy enough for managers to see that things in the business world vary.\nSome marketing campaigns produce great results; similar ones do not. There are\ntimes when the supply chain works effortlessly, and other times when every\nstep is snarled. Some days the numbers look fine, and other days they just\ndon\u2019t add up. Variation is a manager\u2019s natural enemy, making it more difficult\nto sort out what\u2019s really going on, make valid predictions, and be in control.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Sorting out variation provides needed context,\npoints to opportunity, and helps managers maintain their cool when something\ngoes wrong. Managers should learn how to measure variation, understand what it\ntells them about their business, decompose it, and, when necessary, reduce it.\n\nI advise managers to sort out variation and what is causing it. Doing so\nprovides needed context, points to opportunity, and helps them maintain their\ncool when something goes wrong. Consider the following example. The figure\nbelow depicts the error rates for the first three weeks of an invoicing\nprocess:\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_INVOICING1.png)\n\n\n\nAfter week two, the responsible manager was embarrassed \u2014 could her team\nreally be performing that poorly? After the third, she breathed a sigh of\nrelief. The error rate may be high, but at least the trend was in the right\ndirection! She had been extolling her people to \u201cwork harder to get the error\nrate down.\u201d Finally, they were listening!\n\nUnfortunately, her interpretation did not hold up. Here are the measurements\nfor the next seven weeks:\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_INVOICING2.png)\n\n\n\nThis manager\u2019s illusion was shattered the very next week, as the error rate\nwent even higher! Her mistake arose because she did not understand that all\nprocesses vary, often considerably!\n\nThis vignette underscores the first point, which is simply to **acknowledge\nthat variation is important and take it into account**. Specifically, you\nshould always ask, \u201cWhat is the \u2018plus/minus\u2019 around the number?\u201d and\nunderstand the implications. After the third week in this example, the\nplus/minus is fifty percent \u00b1 eight percent (42% to 58%). The \u201ceight percent\u201d\nis two standard deviations, a measure of variability explained further below.\nHad she taken it into account, this manager would not have been so fast to\ncredit her exhortations to the troops with an improvement that wasn\u2019t there.\nMore generally, you should assume that differences within the plus/minus are\ndue to randomness and resist the temptation to take credit or assign blame.\n\nAs you dive into the numbers, it\u2019s important to **understand the sources of\nvariation.** For instance, everyone knows that some full-grown adults are\ntaller than others, and it is easy enough to observe that men, on average, are\ntaller than women. So, in this instance, one component of variation is gender.\n[Similarly, people from the Netherlands are generally taller, and those from\nthe Philippines are generally\nshorter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_average_human_height_worldwide).\nNationality, then, is another source of variation. It is important to\nunderstand these sources of variability if you\u2019re in the clothing business,\nlest you send too many shorter pants to clothing stores in the Netherlands.\n\nThese sources become increasingly important as you **gain a feel for\nmeasurements of variation**. After all, you can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t\nmeasure! The two most important measures of variability are called the\naforementioned \u201cstandard deviation\u201d (\u03c3) and \u201cR-squared (R2) Don\u2019t be put off\nby the nonintuitive names. Instead, focus on interpretation.\n\nThink of the range from one standard deviation (1\u03c3) below the average to one\nstandard deviation above the average as embracing about two-thirds of an\noverall population. Thus, as the figure below depicts, about two-thirds of\nfull-grown U.S. women are between 5\u20191\u201d and 5\u20197\u201d tall. Think of the average\nplus/minus two standard deviations (2\u03c3) as embracing 95% of a population, as\nthe plot also depicts. For U.S. women, this means that only 5% are shorter\nthan 4\u201910\u201d or taller than 5\u20199\u201d. Similarly, the manager responsible for the\nbilling process should expect 95% of all measurements to fall between 42% and\n58% and underscores her misinterpretation of 46% in week three.\n\nFinally, think of the average plus/minus three standard deviations (3\u03c3) as\nembracing all but a fraction of a percent of a population.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_HEIGHTS1.png)\n\n\n\nInterpret R2 as the \u201cfraction of variation due to a particular source.\u201d The\nnext plot features the heights of both men and women. Note that men are about\nfive inches taller, on average, and their heights exhibit slightly higher\nvariation. When it comes to height, clearly men and women are different.\nFurther, the combined population of men and women varies even more. But how\nmuch variation does gender explain in this combined population? The answer is\nabout a third. Thus, gender is an important factor, but there is much more\ngoing on. (Note: Excel, Google sheets, and good statistical and analytic\npackages provide the needed calculations.)\n\nManagers should aim to identify as many important sources of variability as\nthey can. I\u2019ve already noted that gender and nationality are two sources. Age\nmay well be a third, and one can identify plenty of others as well. Each has\nits own R2 and, the larger the R2, the more important the source.  **Once you\nfind an important source of variation, turn your attention to creating\nbusiness advantage.**\n\nImportantly, R2 also applies to entire models. Thus, there is an R2 for even\nthe most complicated model for height. Again, the larger the R2, the better\nthe model.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_HEIGHTS2.png)\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s look back at the example with the team\u2019s error rate. Plus/minus\ncalculations are usually based on two standard deviations. The \u201ceight percent\u201d\nin the \u201cfifty percent \u00b1 eight percent\u201d above is 2\u03c3. The responsible manager of\nthat example should expect 95% of all measurements to fall between 42% and\n58%, and underscores her misinterpretation of 46% in week three.\n\nUnderstanding \u03c3 and R2 enables managers to make more powerful predictions,\nestablish control, and improve performance. The simplest predictions use 3\u03c3\nlimits for the plus/minus. In the next plot, I\u2019ve added these limits (called\nupper and lower control limits, and labeled \u201cucl\u201d and \u201clcl\u201d in the plot) five\nweeks into the future. The manager can now safely predict that unless they\ntake active steps to change it, the process will perform within these limits\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_PREDICTEDERROR.png)\n\n\n\nTo be clear, no manager should be satisfied with either this level of this\nperformance or the associated variation and this manager was not. She and her\nteam dug deeper, finding \u2014 then eliminating \u2014 two sources of variation. This\nwork took several weeks, leading to the chart below.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/07/W190709_REDMAN_ERRORRATES.png)\n\n\n\nImportantly, this manager\u2019s job was much easier starting at week 24. Her\nprocess performed better, and three-quarters of the variation was removed,\nmaking it easier to predict a brighter future.\n\nUnderstanding variation puts a powerful tool in your data science quiver. So\nfirst seek to appreciate, quantify, and identify the important sources of\nvariation. Then reduce those you can and take the others into account to gain\nbusiness advantage. Though they may not be explicit about it, all the best and\nmost popular techniques in data science aim to help you do just that.\nVariation need not be your enemy. Opportunity abounds.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2008/09/110-Tom_Redman2015.jpg)\n\n[Thomas C.

It found that among\nthe arts workers surveyed, some groups historically discriminated against \u2014\nincluding women (65 percent) and disabled people (8 percent) \u2014 were actually\noverrepresented. Gay, lesbian, bisexual or queer individuals constituted 15\npercent of the work force.\n\nBut when it came to race, the study found that people of color were\nsignificantly underrepresented, especially when looking at [upper-level\nleadership positions and board\nmembers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/arts/design/new-york-museums-\ndiversity-staff-boards.html?searchResultPosition=4).\n\nAfter years spent measuring and [analyzing the\nproblem](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/arts/citys-diversity-effort-gets-\nfinancial-backers.html?searchResultPosition=2), the city is now asking\norganizations to work on fixing it. In recent months, 33 cultural institutions\non city-owned property submitted plans to boost diversity and inclusion among\ntheir staff and visitors; if they failed to do so, the city warned, their\nfunding could be cut.\n\nThe plans were filled with organizational charts and multistep processes for\ndiversifying their employees and making people of all backgrounds feel\ncomfortable visiting their sites.\n\n\u201cThis is what our city looks like, and this is what we should look like,\u201d said\nShanta Thake, the senior director of artistic programs at the Public Theater,\nwhich set a goal for its full-time staff to be no more than 50 percent white\nby 2023. (It\u2019s currently 57 percent white.)\n\nBut the question of accountability remained: How far would the city go to hold\nthese groups to their plans?\n\nThe demographic survey, which was completed by Southern Methodist University\nand largely funded by a grant from Deutsche Bank, collected information from\nemployees and volunteers at the 33 institutions on city-owned property and 32\nothers that receive city money. But while the study showed, for example, that\n11 percent of arts workers surveyed are Hispanic, compared with 29 percent of\nNew York\u2019s population, and that 10 percent are black (compared with 22\npercent), the city does not know which organizations have the biggest\ndiversity problems. The study was based on employees\u2019 self-reporting, and the\ninstitutions themselves were not required to submit their comprehensive data\nto the city.\n\nTom Finkelpearl, the cultural affairs commissioner, said in an interview that\nthe goal was not to force organizations to divulge their own demographics but\nto get a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d out of the groups.\n\n\u201cWe are very careful about the idea that we are not encouraging quotas,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe are encouraging practices that are going to result in diverse\nworkforces.\u201d\n\nSo MoMA PS1, for example, said it had ended unpaid internships, which are\noften a barrier to low-income workers; Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts\nsaid it would analyze salary equity; the Wildlife Conservation Society, which\nruns four zoos and the New York Aquarium, said it planned to create a\nmentoring program for employees seeking to move up.\n\nThe plans, which run about 500 pages collectively, often use vague corporate\nterms like \u201cstrategic pillar\u201d and \u201crecruiting pipeline.\u201d Some groups took a\nmore analytical approach, drawing up specific numerical goals for diversity in\nthe coming years.\n\nThe Public Theater, which puts on Shakespeare in the Park, noted a racial\ndisparity at the top echelon. Currently, 23 percent of its trustees are people\nof color, the group reported. It set a goal of at least 35 percent by 2023.\n\nThe Brooklyn Children\u2019s Museum in Crown Heights was attuned to whether the\nleadership reflected a significant portion of its audience: families from\nCentral Brooklyn, who are predominantly people of color. Within six years, the\ngroup said, it wanted to ensure that more than half of the members of the\nmuseum\u2019s executive team are people of color and more than 75 percent of its\nbusiness contracts are with vendors based in Brooklyn.\n\nStephanie Wilchfort, the chief executive of the children\u2019s museum, said that\nfor many organizations, the challenge is that the managers at the top often\nhave trouble recognizing systemic flaws in their institutions and agreeing to\nshare power with others.\n\n\u201cWe have a hierarchical structure,\u201d Ms. Wilchfort said. \u201cThat structure has\nbeen in place, in our case, for 120 years. Some of these plans need to reflect\nthat power is more diffuse than it was.\u201d\n\nAt the American Museum of Natural History, 12 percent of board members were\npeople of color in 2014, before the city\u2019s diversity push. That number climbed\nas the museum focused on increasing that percentage, setting a goal of at\nleast 20 percent. (When asked what percentage of current board members are\npeople of color, the museum said it had actually surpassed its goal and\nreached 21 percent.)\n\nEllen Futter, the president of the museum, said that although the museum set\nan initial percentage goal, its leaders \u201cdon\u2019t think the numerical approach is\nkey here.\u201d Their plan invests in developing and supporting a pipeline of\ndiverse scientists, she said.\n\nPart of the museum\u2019s diversity problem has long been apparent in the content\nof its halls. In its plan, the museum admitted that many of its cultural\ndisplays include \u201cpresentations of non-Western cultures from colonialist or\nimperialist perspectives\u201d that \u201cdo not reflect the values\u201d of the museum. At\nthe same time that the museum is working to improve problematic exhibits \u2014\nlike [the Northwest Coast\nHall](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/northwest-coast), which\nopened in 1899 and has been criticized for failing to include context about\nhow its artifacts were taken from Indigenous people \u2014 Futter said it was\ncommitted to hiring people with diverse cultural identities. Those efforts\nnaturally align, she said.\n\nIn 2017, [Mr. de Blasio pledged to link future\nfunding](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/arts/design/new-york-cultural-\nplan-museums.html?module=inline) for museums and arts groups to the diversity\nof their employees and board members. None are facing a loss of funding right\nnow, but could in the future if they don\u2019t follow through on their plans, said\nMr. Finkelpearl, the cultural affairs commissioner.\n\nFor the groups with smaller staffs, there was some concern about a lack of\nresources to respond to the city\u2019s requests. Cathy Hung, the executive\ndirector of the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning in Queens, said the group\nhas nine full-time staff members and that producing a diversity plan of\nseveral pages was easier to achieve at a large organization with a budget many\ntimes its own.\n\nIf the government doesn\u2019t offer additional financial support, Ms. Hung said,\nthe diversity plan could be just another document required by a government\nagency rather than a tool for change.\n\nA spokesman for the cultural affairs department said that city officials\nrecognized that their demands were more of a burden on smaller organizations,\nand the city provided $130,000 to consortiums of groups based in Queens and\nStaten Island.\n\n\u201cMy feeling \u2014 and I\u2019ve been to many board meetings \u2014 is that this is being\nembraced,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said of the diversity push. \u201cEveryone has the right\nto have the expectation that the cultural life of New York City should be\nreflective of the communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * [\u00a9 2020 The New York Times

February 6, 2020._\n\nWhen Pete Buttigieg accepted a position at the management consultancy McKinsey\n& Company, he already had sterling credentials: high-school valedictorian, a\nbachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard, a Rhodes Scholarship. He could have taken any\nnumber of jobs and, moreover, had no obvious interest in business.\nNevertheless, he joined the firm.\n\nThis move was predictable, not eccentric: The top graduates of elite colleges\ntypically pass through McKinsey or a similar firm before settling into their\nadult career. But the conventional nature of the career path makes it more,\nnot less, worthy of examination. How did this come to pass? And what\nconsequences has the rise of management consulting had for the organization of\nAmerican business and the lives of American workers?\n\n[J](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/why-young-progressives-\nhate-pete-buttigieg/603619/)[ohn McWhorter: The woke attack on Pete\nButtigieg](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/attack-mayor-\npete/602755/)\n\nThe answers to these questions put management consultants at the epicenter of\neconomic inequality and the destruction of the American middle class. The\nanswers also explain why the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing is so suspicious of\nthe nice and obviously impressive young man who wishes to be president.\n\nManagement consultants advise managers on how to run companies; McKinsey alone\nserves management at [90 of the world\u2019s 100 largest\ncorporation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/mckinsey-hedge-\nfund.html)[s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/mckinsey-hedge-\nfund.html). Managers do not produce goods or deliver services. Instead, they\nplan what goods and services a company will provide, and they coordinate the\nproduction workers who make the output. Because complex goods and services\nrequire much planning and coordination, management (even though it is only\nindirectly productive) adds a great deal of value. And managers as a class\ncapture much of this value as pay. This makes the question of who gets to be a\nmanager extremely consequential.\n\nIn the middle of the last century, management saturated American corporations.\nEvery worker, from the CEO down to production personnel, served partly as a\nmanager, participating in planning and coordination along an unbroken\ncontinuum in which each job closely resembled its nearest neighbor.\nElaborately layered middle managers\u2014or \u201c[organization\nmen](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812218190)\u201d\u2014coordinated production\namong long-term employees. In turn, companies taught workers the skills they\nneeded to rise up the ranks. At IBM, for example, a 40-year worker might spend\nmore than four years, or 10 percent, of his work life in fully paid, IBM-\nprovided training.\n\nMid-century labor unions (which represented [a third of the private-sector\nworkforce](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/23/385843576/50-years-\nof-shrinking-union-membership-in-one-map)), organized the lower rungs of a\ncompany\u2019s hierarchy into an additional control center\u2014as part of what the\nUnited States Supreme Court, writing in 1960, called \u201c[industrial self-\ngovernment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/363/574)\u201d\u2014and in\nthis way also contributed to the management function. Even production workers\nbecame, on account of lifetime employment and workplace training, functionally\nthe lowest-level managers. They were charged with planning and coordinating\nthe development of their own skills to serve the long-run interests of their\nemployers.\n\nThe mid-century corporation\u2019s workplace training and many-layered hierarchy\nbuilt a pipeline through which the top jobs might be filled. The saying \u201cfrom\nthe mail room to the corner office\u201d captured something real, and even the most\nmenial jobs opened pathways to promotion. In 1939, for example, all save two\nof the grocery chain Safeway\u2019s division managers had started their careers\nbehind the checkout counter. At McDonald\u2019s, Ed Rensi worked his way up from\n[flipping burgers in the 1960s to become\nCEO](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-\nxpm-1997-07-10-9707100173-story.html). More broadly, a 1952 report by\n_Fortune_ magazine found that two-thirds of senior executives had more than 20\nyears\u2019 service at their current companies.\n\nMiddle managers, able to plan and coordinate production independently of\nelite-executive control, shared not just the responsibilities but also the\nincome and status gained from running their companies. Top executives enjoyed\ncommensurately less control and captured lower incomes. This democratic\napproach to management compressed the distribution of income and status. In\nfact, a mid-century study of General Motors published in the _Harvard Business\nReview_ \u2014completed, in a portent of what was to come, by McKinsey\u2019s Arch\nPatton\u2014found that from[ 1939 to 1950, hourly workers\u2019 wages rose roughly three\ntimes faster than elite executives\u2019\npay](https://business.time.com/2013/09/10/mass-layoffs-overpaid-ceos-blame-\nmckinsey/). The management function\u2019s wide diffusion throughout the workforce\nsubstantially built the mid-century middle class.\n\nAt the time of Patton\u2019s study, McKinsey and other management consultants still\nplayed a relatively minor role in how American companies were run. The\n[earliest consultants were\nengineers](https://books.google.com/books?id=Vb2cAQAAQBAJ&q=engineers#v=snippet&q=engineers&f=false)\nwho advised factory owners on measuring and improving efficiency at the\ncomplex factories required for industrial production. The then-leading firm,\nBooz Allen, did not achieve annual revenues of $2 million until after the\nSecond World War. McKinsey, which didn\u2019t hire [its first Harvard M.B.A. until\n1953](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mckinsey-hiring-policy-2013-9),\nretained a diffident and traditional ethos\u2014requiring its consultants to wear\nfedoras until President John F. Kennedy stopped wearing his.\n\nThings changed in the 1960s, with McKinsey leading the way. In 1965 and 1966,\nthe firm placed help-wanted ads in _The_ _New York Times_ and _Time_ magazine,\nwith the goal of generating applications that it could then reject, to\nestablish its own eliteness. McKinsey\u2019s competitors followed suit, as when the\nBoston Consulting Group\u2019s Bruce Henderson took out ads in the Harvard Business\nSchool student newspaper seeking to hire \u201cnot just the run-of-that-mill but,\ninstead, scholars\u2014Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Baker Scholars (the top\n5 percent of the class).\u201d\n\nA new ideal of shareholder primacy, powerfully championed by Milton Friedman\nin a 1970 _New York Times Magazine_ article entitled \u201c[The Social\nResponsibility of Business is to Increase its\nProfits](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/article-15-no-\ntitle.html),\u201d gave the newly ambitious management consultants a guiding\npurpose. According to this ideal, in language eventually adopted by the\n[Business Roundtable](http://www.ralphgomory.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/05/Business-Roundtable-1997.pdf), \u201cthe paramount duty of\nmanagement and of boards of directors is to the corporation\u2019s stockholders.\u201d\nDuring the 1970s, and accelerating into the \u201980s and \u201990s, the upgraded\nmanagement consultants pursued this duty by expressly and relentlessly taking\naim at the middle managers who had dominated mid-century firms, and whose\nwages weighed down the bottom line.\n\n[Daniel Markovits: How life became an endless, terrible\ncompetition](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-\nmiserable-winners/594760/)\n\nAs the business journalist Walter Kiechel put it in his book _Lords of\nStrategy_ , consultants openly sought to \u201cfoment a stratification within\ncompanies and society\u201d by concentrating the management function in elite\nexecutives, aided (of course) by advisers from consultants\u2019 own ranks.\nManagement-consulting firms deployed a panoply of branded processes against\nmiddle management. Another account of the industry, _The Witch Doctors_ ,\nexplains that the Computer Sciences Corporation\u2019s consulting arm, working with\nthe Sloan School of Management at MIT, developed corporate \u201creengineering\u201d to\n\u201cbreak an organization down into its components parts,\u201d eliminate the\nredundant ones, namely middle managers, and then put the remaining parts\n\u201ctogether again to create a new machine.\u201d GTE, Apple, and Pacific Bell would\nall cite reengineering as responsible for their downsizing. McKinsey framed\nits path to downsizing, which the firm called \u201c[overhead value\nanalysis](https://hbr.org/1975/05/make-overhead-cuts-that-last),\u201d as an answer\nto the mid-century corporation\u2019s excessive reliance on middle management. As\nMcKinsey\u2019s John Neuman admitted in an essay introducing the method, the\n\u201cprocess, though swift, is not painless. Since overhead expenses are typically\n70% to 85% people-related and most savings come from work-force reductions,\ncutting overhead does demand some wrenching decisions.\u201d\n\nManagement consultants thus implemented and rationalized a transformation in\nthe American corporation. Companies that had long affirmed express \u201cno layoff\u201d\npolicies now took aim at what the corporate raider Carl Icahn, writing in the\n[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/29/magazine/levereaged-\nbuyouts-america-pays-the-price-the-case-for-takeovers.html) in the late 1980s,\ncalled \u201ccorporate bureaucracies\u201d run by \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cinbred\u201d middle\nmanagers. They downsized in response not to particular business problems but\nrather to a new managerial ethos and methods; they downsized when profitable\nas well as when struggling, and during booms as well as busts. The downsizing\n[peaked](https://origins.osu.edu/history-news/downsizing-becomes-normal)\nduring the extraordinary economic boom of the 1990s. The culls, moreover, were\ndramatic. AT&T, for example, once aimed to cut the ratio of managers to\nnonmanagers in one of its units from 1:5 to 1:30. Overall, middle managers\nwere downsized at nearly twice the rate of nonmanagerial workers. Downsizing\nwas indeed wrenching. When IBM [abandoned lifetime employment in the\n1990s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/03/31/for-workers-\nsurplused-by-ibm-lives-forever-changed/1abb382f-1438-4fde-93f1-d625d43a4b49/),\nlocal officials [asked gun-shop owners around its headquarters to close their\nstores](https://prospect.org/labor/system-crash/) while employees absorbed the\nshock.\n\nProduction workers did not escape the whirlwind, as companies\u2014again with help\nfrom consultants\u2014 stripped them of their residual management functions and the\nbenefits that these sustained. Corporations broke their unions, and jobs that\nonce carried bright futures became gloomy. [United Parcel\nService](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1997-06-15/at-ups-part-time-\nwork-is-a-full-time-issue), long famous for its full-time workers and\npromoting from within, began emphasizing part-time work in 1993. Its union\u2014the\nTeamsters\u2014struck in 1997, under the slogan \u201cPart-time America won\u2019t work,\u201d but\nfailed to return the company to its past employment practices. UPS has since\nhired more than half a million part-time workers, with just 13,000 advancing\nwithin the company.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics\n\nOverall, [the share of private-sector workers belonging to a union\nfell](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/union-membership-\nrate-10-point-7-percent-in-2016.htm) from about one-third in 1960 to less than\none-sixteenth in 2016. In some cases, downsized employees have been hired back\nas subcontractors, with no long-term claim on the companies and no role in\nrunning them. When IBM laid off masses of workers in the 1990s, for example,\nit hired back one in five as\n[consultants](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/nyregion/life-on-the-other-\nside-of-ibm.html). Other corporations were built from scratch on a\nsubcontracting model. The clothing brand United Colors of Benetton has only\n1,500 employees but uses 25,000 workers through subcontractors.\n\nThe shift from permanent to precarious jobs continues apace. Buttigieg\u2019s work\nat McKinsey included an [engagement for Blue Cross Blue Shield of\nMichigan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-\nmckinsey-clients.html), during a period when it considered cutting up to 1,000\njobs (or 10 percent of its workforce). And the gig economy is just a high-tech\ngeneralization of the sub-contractor model. Uber is a more extreme Benetton;\nit deprives drivers of any role in planning and coordination, and it has\nliterally no corporate hierarchy through which drivers can rise up to join\nmanagement. As ever, consultants are at the forefront of change, aiming to\ndisrupt the management function. A new breed of management-consulting firms\n[now deploys algorithmic\nprocessing](https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35)\nto automate not the line workers\u2019 or sales associates\u2019 jobs, but the manager\u2019s\njob.\n\nIn effect, management consulting is a tool that allows corporations to replace\nlifetime employees with short-term, part-time, and even subcontracted workers,\nhired under ever more tightly controlled arrangements, who sell particular\nskills and even specified outputs, and who manage nothing at all.\n\n[R](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-\nshame/476415/)[ead: The 9.9 percent is the new American\naristocracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-\nof-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/)\n\nThe management function has not been rendered unnecessary, of course, or\ndisappeared. Instead, the managerial control stripped from middle managers and\nproduction workers has been concentrated in a narrow cadre of executives who\nmonopolize planning and coordination. Mid-century, democratic management\nempowered ordinary workers and disempowered elite executives, so that a bad\nCEO could do little to harm a company and a good one little to help it. Today,\ntop executives boast immense powers of command\u2014and, as a result, capture\nvirtually all of management\u2019s economic returns. Whereas at mid-century a\ntypical large-company CEO made 20 times a production worker\u2019s income, [today\u2019s\nCEOs make nearly 300 times as much](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-\ncompensation-2018/). In a recent year, the five highest-paid employees of the\nS&P 1500 (7,500 elite executives overall), obtained income equal to about [10\npercent of the total\nprofits](http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/bebchuk/pdfs/Bebchuk-\nGrinstein.Growth-of-Pay.pdf) of the entire S&P 1500.\n\nManagement consultants insist that meritocracy required the restructuring that\nthey encouraged\u2014that, as Kiechel [put it\ndryly](https://books.google.com/books?id=1e_JFkI3DPMC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=Walter+Kiechel+%22some+pigs+are+smarter%22&source=bl&ots=qIxSgcR8gw&sig=ACfU3U0J0jUQT_11yyLglPlugfHZS9e19w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-\np_LN3KbnAhUGlnIEHYOzBaEQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=Walter%20Kiechel%20%22some%20pigs%20are%20smarter%22&f=false),\n\u201cwe are _not_ all in this together; some pigs are smarter than other pigs and\ndeserve more money.\u201d Consultants seek, in this way, to legitimate both the job\ncuts and the explosion of elite pay. Properly understood, the corporate\nreorganizations were, then, not merely technocratic but ideological. Rather\nthan simply improving management, to make American corporations lean and fit,\nthey fostered hierarchy, making management, in David Gordon\u2019s memorable\nphrase, \u201cfat and mean.\u201d\n\nRunning a company on a concentrated model requires a cadre of managers who\npossess the capacity and taste to work with the intensity demanded of top\nexecutives today. At the same time, corporate reorganizations have deprived\ncompanies of an internal supply of managerial workers. When restructurings\neradicated workplace training and purged the middle rungs of the corporate\nladder, they also forced companies to look beyond their walls for managerial\ntalent\u2014to elite colleges, business schools, and (of course) to management-\nconsulting firms. That is to say: The administrative techniques that\nmanagement consultants invented created a huge demand for precisely the\nservices that the consultants supply.\n\nThis is where the recent history of American management intersects with Pete\nButtigieg\u2019s life story.\n\n[R](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/americas-hot-new-job-\nbeing-rich-persons-servant/595774/)[ead: The secret shame of middle-class\nAmericans](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-\nshame/476415/)\n\nWhereas a century ago, fewer than one in five of America\u2019s business leaders\nhad completed college, top executives today typically have elite\ndegrees\u2014M.B.A.s as well as bachelor\u2019s degrees\u2014and deep ties to management\nconsulting. Many executives have consulting backgrounds themselves. McKinsey\nalone counts [70 ](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/13/mckinseys-secret-influence-\non-american-\nbusiness.html)[_Fortune_](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/13/mckinseys-secret-\ninfluence-on-american-business.html)[ 500 CEOs among its\nalumni](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/13/mckinseys-secret-influence-on-\namerican-business.html), including the current CEOs or COOs at Google,\nFacebook, and Morgan Stanley. Indeed, a greater share of McKinsey employees\nbecome CEOs than [any other company\u2019s in the\nworld](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2008-01-08-ceo-\ncompanies_N.htm). Management consultants who stay with their firms also do\nvery well. The three most elite management consultancies\u2014McKinsey, Bain &\nCompany, and the Boston Consulting Group\u2014regularly boast double-digit revenue\ngrowth and today generate nearly $20 billion in revenues and employ nearly\n50,000 people.\n\nThese facts give management consulting a powerful charisma for students and\nrecent graduates of elite colleges and universities. Today, management\nconsulting sits beside finance as the most [popular first\njob](https://features.thecrimson.com/2017/senior-survey/after-harvard-\nnarrative/index.html) for graduates of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\n([Stanford graduates](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/files-\nfpp/23396/mba-employment-report-2019.pdf) choose among consulting, finance,\nand tech.) Harvard Business School, which sent zero graduates to McKinsey\nprior to 1953, now regularly [sends nearly a quarter of its graduating class\ninto consulting](https://www.hbs.edu/recruiting/data/Pages/at-a-glance.aspx),\nwhile Wharton graduates are 10 times [more\nlikely](https://statistics.mbacareers.wharton.upenn.edu/full-time/industry-\nchoices/#1510065951639-9c39725c-3aac) to work in consulting than in\nmanufacturing.\n\nThe incomes that management consultants secure renders these numbers\nunsurprising. [McKinsey pays B.A.s nearly\n$100,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2016/09/01/the-\nconsulting-firms-that-pay-new-college-grads-the-most-in-2016/#3850b4276920)\nand [newly minted M.B.A.s nearly\n$200,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/13-highest-paying-consulting-firms-\nfor-mbas-pwc-bain-mckinsey), and although the firm does not release\ninformation about profits, industry insiders believe that partners might\ncommand incomes in the millions. McKinsey\u2019s charisma, however, is not just\neconomic. The firm continues to perform its own eliteness, with the\napplication process involving famously rigorous analytic interviews\u2014which test\nformal problem-solving skills but no substantive knowledge (certainly not of\nany concrete industry or business)\u2014so that getting hired has in itself become\na mark of accomplishment at top colleges. McKinsey also continues aggressively\nto recruit the most elite graduates, treating Rhodes or Marshall Scholarships\nas equivalent to M.B.A.s for the purpose of rank and pay, and\n[boasting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/24/problem-with-\nbuttigiegs-work-mckinsey-isnt-his-clients-its-mckinsey/), \u201cWe are the largest\nemployers of Rhodes scholars and Marshall scholars on the planet, outside of\nthe United States government.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the firm expressly emphasizes its internal meritocracy. McKinsey\u2019s\nmission statement promises to \u201ccreate an unrivaled environment for exceptional\npeople\u201d and the firm boasts of its \u201c[university-like\ncapabilities](https://www.economist.com/business/2013/05/11/to-the-brainy-the-\nspoils),\u201d which give its consultants proprietary analytic powers that no other\nbusiness advisers can match. A [recent\nsurvey](https://poetsandquants.com/2016/06/17/mba-envy-not-know-hard-work/2/)\nof business-school graduates found that it demands longer hours than any\nemployer of M.B.A.s other than Goldman Sachs and Barclays. And it embraces an\n\u201cup or out\u201d promotion regime, under which people who stop advancing through\nthe firm are asked to leave.\n\nConsulting, like law school, is an all-purpose status giver\u2014\u201clow in risk and\nhigh in reward,\u201d according to the [_Harvard\nCrimson_](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-\nharvard-fm/). McKinsey also hopes that its meritocratic excellence will\nlegitimate its activities in the eyes of the broader world. Management\nconsulting, Kiechel observed, acquired its power and authority not from\n\u201csilver-haired industry experience but rather from the brilliance of its ideas\nand the obvious candlepower of the people explaining them, even if those\npeople were twenty-eight years old.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg fit the McKinsey profile perfectly. \u201cI went to work at McKinsey\nbecause I wanted to understand how the world worked,\u201d [he has\nsaid](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/pete-buttigieg-\nplans-win-democratic-presidential-nomination-defeat-trump), adding that \u201cthey\nwere willing to take a chance on me even though I didn\u2019t have an M.B.A.\u201d He\nbelieves that the lessons the firm teaches apply widely, not just across\nindustries but to government as well: [In an interview with\n](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/pete-buttigieg-\nmckinsey/603421/)[_The\nAtlantic_](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/pete-\nbuttigieg-\nmckinsey/603421/)[,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/pete-\nbuttigieg-mckinsey/603421/) he said that McKinsey was \u201ca place where I could\nlearn as much as I could by working on interesting problems and challenges in\nthe private sector, the public sector, in the nonprofit sector.\u201d Perhaps he\nwas right. He became\u2014without any prior governmental experience\u2014the youngest\nmayor in South Bend\u2019s history; and now he aspires to become\u2014without ever\nhaving held national or even statewide office\u2014the youngest president in\nAmerican history.\n\n[R](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/pete-buttigieg-\nmckinsey/603421/)[ead: The price of ascending America\u2019s class\nladder](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/09/parents-class-\njennifer-morton/598093/)\n\nYet Buttigieg\u2019s association with McKinsey also exacerbates the left\u2019s\nskepticism of his candidacy. The firm\u2019s clients\u2014which include\n[ICE](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html),\n[opioid manufacturers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/mckinsey-\njohnson-and-johnson-opioids.html), and\n[authoritarian](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/mckinsey-\nbcg-booz-allen-saudi-khashoggi.html)\n[regimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/world/asia/mckinsey-china-\nrussia.html)\u2014generated the first doubtful headlines, as people wanted to know\nwhether Buttigieg would disclose his McKinsey client list. Buttigieg\n[answered,](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/6/20998972/pete-\nbuttigieg-mckinsey-fundraisers-elizabeth-warren) \u201cI never worked on a project\ninconsistent with my values, and if asked to do so, I would have left the firm\nrather than participate.\u201d He probably wouldn\u2019t have had to leave, because\nMcKinsey allows its employees to refuse to work for particular clients that\nthey regard as unconscionable. It is therefore no surprise that when Buttigieg\neventually did disclose his clients, the companies were indeed benign.\n\nA deeper objection to Buttigieg\u2019s association with McKinsey concerns not\n_whom_ the firm represents but the central role the consulting revolution has\nplayed in fueling the enormous economic inequalities that now threaten to turn\nthe United States into a caste society.\n\nMeritocrats like Buttigieg changed not just corporate strategies but also\ncorporate values. Particular industries, and still more individual companies,\nmay be committed to distinctive, concrete goals and ideals. GM may aspire to\nbuild good cars; IBM, to make typewriters, computers, and other business\nmachines; and AT&T, to improve communications. Executives who rose up through\nthese companies, on the mid-century model, were embedded in their firms and\nembraced these values, so that they might even have come to view profits as a\nsalutary side effect of running their businesses well. When management\nconsulting untethered executives from particular industries or firms and tied\nthem instead to management in general, it also led them to embrace the one\nthing common to all corporations: making money for shareholders. Executives\nraised on the new, untethered model of management aim exclusively and directly\nat profit: their education, their career arc, and their professional role\nconspire to isolate them from other workers and train them single-mindedly on\nthe bottom line.\n\nButtigieg carries this worldview into his politics. Wendell Potter, at [_The\nIntercept_](https://theintercept.com/2019/12/18/capitalisms-consigliere-\nmckinseys-work-for-insurance-companies-ice-drug-manufacturers-and-despots/),\nobserves that \u201ca lot\u201d of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign language about health care,\nincluding \u201cspecific words\u201d is \u201cstraight out of the health-insurance industry\u2019s\nplaybook.\u201d The influence of management consulting, moreover, goes far beyond\nlanguage to the very rationale for Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy. What he offers\nAmerica is intellect and elite credentials\u2014a combination that McKinsey has\ntaught him and others like him to believe should more than compensate for an\nobvious deficit of directly relevant experience.\n\nThis is a dangerous belief. Technocratic management, no matter how brilliant,\ncannot unwind the structural inequalities that are dismantling the American\nmiddle class. To think that it can is to be insensible of the real harms that\ntechnocratic elites, at McKinsey and other management-consulting firms, have\ndone to America. Such obliviousness may not be malevolent; but it is clueless.\n\nAnd emphasizing private virtue or personal ethics\u2014including the ethics that\nwould have led Buttigieg to reject distasteful clients\u2014only protects\nstructural inequalities, by creating scapegoats to absorb moral scruples and\nredirect outrage away from systemic injustice. American democracy, the left\nbelieves, cannot be rejuvenated by persuading elites to deploy their excessive\npower somehow more benevolently. Instead, it requires breaking the\nstranglehold that elites have on our economics and politics, and reempowering\neveryone else.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

the strength of an organization\u2019s\nteams, which have the ability to power business success.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | July 19, 2019 \u2022 12 min read\n\nTopics: [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Piecing-Together-\nTalent-700x450.jpg)\n\nMarcus Buckingham believes the concept of \u201ccorporate culture\u201d may be a tad\nover-rated.\n\nIn fact, although culture is often touted as one of the most important factors\nin attracting and retaining talent, he believes there\u2019s a much more important\nelement that often gets overlooked: teams, and the people who lead them.\n\nIn Buckingham\u2019s latest book, _Nine Lies About Work: A Freethinking Leader\u2019s\nGuide to the Real World_ , the world-famous consultant, along with co-author\nAshley Goodall, writes that too many leaders (HR and otherwise) have bought\ninto certain notions about what motivates and inspires people. This has led to\nprocesses and structures that serve only to reinforce these stereotypes and\nultimately cause employees to become disengaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nLie No. 1, Buckingham and Goodall write, is that people care which company\nthey work for. While there may be a surfeit of \u201cbest places to work\u201d lists,\nand many HR leaders are desperate to get their organizations onto such lists\nto help them stand out in the war for talent, research shows that the quality\nof work you\u2019ll get from people once they do join depends very much on the\n_team_ they\u2019re on, not the company.\n\nEmployee engagement, productivity and retention (all vitally important to HR)\nare primarily influenced by the teams that people work for and the leaders of\nthose teams, Buckingham and Goodall write.\n\n\u201cTeams still matter, we\u2019ve just lost sight of them,\u201d says Buckingham, author\nof the bestselling _First, Break All the Rules_ and head of people and\nperformance research at the ADP Research Institute. As assembly lines started\nto play a dominant role in the workplace, the work done by teams became\nobscured by \u201cprocess,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, people are often interested in an organization\u2019s\nculture and perks. But once they join, says Goodall, \u201call of that stuff\nvanishes and the culture becomes much less important than the people around\nyou every day: Do they help you and support you? The product of work is the\nproduct of the team.\n\n\u201cThis is not a new thing; it\u2019s eternal, but somehow we\u2019ve missed it,\u201d adds\nGoodall, senior vice president of leadership and team intelligence at global\ntechnology firm Cisco.\n\nCisco itself routinely ranks as one of the best places to work, coming in at\nNo. 6 this year on [_Fortune_ \u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work\nFor](https://fortune.com/best-companies/2019). At the company, all work is\ndone by teams, says Goodall.\n\n\u201cWe want to do three things: create amazing tech, sell it and service that\ntech for our customers,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of those things is done by a team\nworking together.\u201d\n\nAdds Buckingham: \u201cCisco is a great example of what happens when you make teams\nyour source of insight and curiosity.\u201d\n\n## **What Makes a Great Team**\n\nTeams are becoming increasingly important throughout all industries, not just\nthe tech sector.\n\nAt Combined Insurance, a Chicago-based firm with 5,400 employees in North\nAmerica, project-based teams are playing a prominent role as the company\nadapts to changes in the insurance sector.\n\n\u201cWe have more advanced initiatives that require larger team-based projects,\u201d\nsays Assistant Vice President for Talent Acquisition Melanie Lundberg.\n\u201cProcess automation is big in insurance and requires a lot of stakeholders.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s dynamic process improvements, new-tech implementations or\nredesigning end-to-end processes, the need for more cross-collaboration among\ndifferent functions at Combined Insurance has never been greater, says\nLundberg. \u201cI think, because of the level of complexity and how agile we all\nneed to be now, it just requires more work with people from different\nfunctions collaborating together.\u201d\n\nAt Surgical Care Affiliates, which operates 215 outpatient surgical centers\nthroughout the U.S., having effective teams is critical to the company\u2019s\nmission of growing its business by offering high-quality surgeries at lower\ncosts than hospitals. So far, it\u2019s seen success, with 92% of patients\nindicating they\u2019d recommend the company\u2019s services to others. However, keeping\nthe momentum going requires highly engaged teams, says Vice President of HR\nWarren J. Cinnick.\n\nEach of SCA\u2019s centers is considered a team, comprising about 40 people led by\na CEO. The leaders are designated \u201cCEO\u201d instead of \u201cadministrator,\u201d as is\ncommon in the healthcare field, for a good reason, says Cinnick.\n\n\u201cThey interact with the physicians who are co-owners of the facility, they\ninteract with the community and with patients, and they own the [profit and\nloss] of each center,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result, we thought we\u2019d elevate their\nvision of themselves by calling them CEOs.\u201d\n\nThe job of team leader is a vital one, yet most companies have not prioritized\nit, says Goodall.\n\n\u201cFor anyone seeking to build great teams, it starts with great team leaders,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an add-on job, it is the thing. I think companies have\ngotten very careless of the fact that leading a team is a job and, arguably,\nthe most important job in any organization.\u201d\n\nThe best teams are often led by so-called \u201cconnector managers,\u201d says Sari\nWilde, managing vice president of Gartner\u2019s HR practice.\n\nWilde, who\u2019s conducted extensive research on leadership and is co-author of\nthe upcoming book _The Connector Manager: Why Some Leaders Build Exceptional\nTalent\u2014And Others Don\u2019t_ , says such leaders possess five core leadership\nqualities. Three of them are curiosity about people and ideas, an openness to\nlearning from different perspectives and demonstrating courage in challenging\nsituations.\n\n\u201cThese are leaders who are confident in their decisions and are not going to\nshy away from making difficult choices,\u201d she says.\n\nThe fourth area involves transparency and self-awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s the\nwillingness to show vulnerability, that you\u2019re aware of your own strengths and\nweaknesses,\u201d says Wilde. \u201cSo many managers want to be seen as the best at\neverything, but connectors are OK admitting they don\u2019t know something and\nencourage others to be transparent as well.\u201d\n\nThe fifth quality is judicious generosity. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just generous with the\ntime they spend coaching others, but with sharing credit for results and\nallocating power across the team,\u201d she says.\n\nAnita Williams Woolley, associate professor of organizational behavior and\ntheory at Carnegie-Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, has studied\nwhat makes teams successful.\n\nGreat teams have cognitive diversity and collaborative ability, she says. They\nalso tend to have more women.\n\n\u201cSocial perceptiveness is the ability to pick up on the subtle cues with the\npeople one is interacting with, and women tend to score higher on that than\nmen,\u201d says Woolley. \u201cSo, having more women tends to raise teams\u2019 ability on\nthat, and that fosters greater collaborative behaviors.\u201d\n\nEffective teams also have team leaders who not only understand and appreciate\nthe need for collaboration and cognitive diversity, she says, but ensure their\nteam has clear goals and the time and resources to be productive.\n\n\u201cTeams often get assembled with people who are already serving on other teams\nand who end up getting pulled in too many different directions,\u201d says Woolley.\n\u201cSetting a team up for success includes providing them clarity on what they\u2019re\nsupposed to accomplish and giving them the time to do it.\u201d\n\n## **Supporting Team Leaders**\n\nAt Cisco, which has nearly 75,000 employees spread around the world, the\ncompany has devoted extensive time and resources to ensuring its teams are\nwell led and have what they need, says Goodall.\n\nThe most important criterion for a team leader at Cisco is \u201cappetite,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cWe try to find people who are fascinated by the endless challenges of\nleading a team and are energized to learn how to do it.\u201d\n\nOne way the company does that is by offering learning programs targeted at\naspiring leaders so they can learn about the role of team leader and decide if\nit\u2019s for them. For existing team leaders who\u2019re hoping to move up in the\norganization, Cisco looks hard at whether they\u2019re meeting its minimum\nexpectations of team leadership\u2014by, for example, giving frequent strengths-\nbased attention to team members and engaging the entire team in discussions\nabout how they can be more like the company\u2019s best teams.\n\nIn 2016, the company selected a sample of 97 of its best teams by asking\nleaders across the organization to nominate the teams \u201cthey\u2019d like to clone,\u201d\nsays Goodall. It also selected a comparison group of several thousand team\nmembers. Each group then answered a dozen questions about their team\nexperience, drawn from prior research on team excellence.\n\n\u201cWe discovered that members of our best teams were disproportionately more\nlikely to report they were using their strengths every day, were supported by\ntheir teammates and felt that they shared a common understanding of excellence\nwith the people on their team,\u201d he says.\n\nThese and other findings were incorporated into a survey tool available to any\nteam leader at Cisco. They can use the tool to benchmark their own team\nagainst the best teams and use it to facilitate a discussion within the team\non what\u2019s working and what they\u2019d like to build on, says Goodall.\n\nCisco doesn\u2019t send its team leaders off-site for training. Instead, company-\ntrained facilitators work with teams on-site in order to ensure their workflow\nisn\u2019t interrupted, says Goodall.\n\n\u201cThe norm for any sort of training for teamwork is that you send someone off-\nsite for training and hope whatever they learn somehow translates back to the\nreal-world messiness of the daily work,\u201d he says. Given the sheer number of\nteams and team leaders at Cisco, this would be burdensomely expensive and\nimpractical, he adds. By working with teams and their leaders directly,\nfacilitators ensure the training can be applied immediately to their day-to-\nday work.\n\nAt Combined Insurance, the company\u2019s lean operating model has led Lundberg to\nrely mostly on internal resources to train teams and their leaders. She\nherself will oversee a course on project leadership later this year. She also\ntaps leaders within the company who\u2019ve been certified by the Project\nManagement Institute to assist with training.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways HR can develop other leaders is by using the leaders you\nhave to lead in-house development programs,\u201d she says. \u201cThey know the business\nand the people, and it gets you away from having to use the big, expensive\nconsultancies.\u201d\n\nAt SCA, team leaders receive coaching in in three fundamentals: hiring,\nonboarding and feedback.\n\n\u201cIf you hire people effectively, you\u2019ll end up with great people,\u201d says\nCinnick. \u201cIf you onboard them effectively, that\u2019s another part of having a\ngreat team. And then if you give them feedback that\u2019s kind, caring and upbeat,\nthat is essential.\u201d\n\nAll CEOs complete the company\u2019s CEO Development Program to learn those\nfundamentals.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to help them be awesome, to lead and engage these teams,\u201d\nsays Cinnick.\n\nThe CEOs are evaluated on the fundamentals by metrics such as first-year\nturnover for new hires, how fast new hires achieve productivity compared with\nSCA\u2019s other centers and whether a center\u2019s employees are receiving regular\nfeedback that helps them achieve their goals, says Cinnick.\n\nWith centers spread across 34 states, monitoring and sustaining team\nengagement levels isn\u2019t easy for SCA, Cinnick admits. CEOs are expected to\nhelp maintain engagement by keeping their teams focused on SCA\u2019s six values:\nclinical quality, integrity, service excellence, teamwork, accountability and\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are trained to have regular reviews of those values during\nmorning meetings,\u201d he says. A CEO will typically ask a team member to speak\nabout one of the values\u2014what it means to them, how it applies to the center\u2019s\npatients and physician-partners. \u201cThere\u2019s a thoughtful, intentional attempt\nacross all sites to do that.\u201d\n\nSCA\u2019s employee-engagement surveys, which are administered by Aon, have risen\nsteadily over the years and currently show an engagement score of 78, says\nCinnick. \u201cWhen we get to 80, that\u2019s considered best-in-class, and we hope to\nreach that this year.\u201d\n\n## **The Role of Tech**\n\nWhen it comes to helping HR identify and support workplace teams, the tech\nsector has been lacking, says Buckingham.\n\n\u201cMost of our HR systems are extensions of ERP systems,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think of\npeople as extensions of our budgetary processes\u2014how much they cost, and so\non\u2014and that\u2019s where we get our HCM systems.\u201d\n\nThe enterprise tools widely used today don\u2019t show teams, says Buckingham.\nTeams tend not to be reflected in organizational charts, even though the\nmajority of work today is accomplished via teams.\n\nHowever, newer tools, such as Slack and Webex Teams, are making it easier for\nmanagers to assemble and lead teams, he says.\n\n\u201cThese are collaboration tools and, when they\u2019re designed well, they hit team\nleaders in stride,\u201d says Buckingham. \u201cYou start putting tools like them in\nmanagers\u2019 hands and teams start emerging.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nVendors such as SAP SuccessFactors and Infor have also introduced new tools\ndesigned to help team leaders. Cultivate, an app that's available on SAP.iO,\nprovides team leaders with data on who they talk to the most and how much\nfeedback they give.\n\n\u201c[Cultivate] can lead managers to have very different conversations with their\nteams, get coaching in the moment so they can rectify things or have more\nupfront conversations that help build relationships and trust,\u201d says Brigette\nMcInnis-Day, chief operating officer at SAP SuccessFactors.\n\nInfor\u2019s Team Dynamics tool is designed to \u201clook at the degree of behavioral\nalignment on a team,\u201d says Jill Strange, the company\u2019s vice president of\ntalent applications. \u201cWe use our Talent Science Assessment to look at how\naligned or diverse a team is and suggest configurations for a team based on\nthe goal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Infor\u2019s Team Insights tool is designed to help team leaders\ndetermine where their team is most behaviorally aligned, whether it needs\ngreater diversity and what impact moving certain employees in and out of a\nteam might have, she says.\n\nLooking ahead, a focus of HR tech will be on helping organizations create,\ntrain and manage effective teams, says Buckingham.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, the challenge in learning is how do you take real-time data\nabout a team, the skills and strengths of the people within it\u2014and whether\nengagement is up or down\u2014and use that to trigger the delivery of relevant\npresentations to the team?\u201d he says.\n\nFor example, when a new person joins a team, the system would be triggered to\ngive that employee data on other members of the team. If a team leader sees\nengagement scores dip, the system would be able to deliver suggestions on what\nhe or she could do to re-energize the team. It could also deliver coaching\nthat\u2019s customized to who the person is as a team leader, says Buckingham.\n\n\u201cOver time, learning will become real-world, individualized coaching delivered\nthrough tech, in real time,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201d\n\nAndrew R.

Now, applications can\nbe denied by consular officers in instances where questions about the\napplicant\u2019s eligibility cannot be resolved quickly in the visa interview.\nImmigration attorneys told TOI that subjectivity could creep into the entire\nprocess of adjudication. There would be greater scrutiny, and higher denial\nrates.\n\n  \nL-1 visas enable an employer to quickly and effectively transfer their\nexecutives or managers from a foreign office (say in India) to the US office.\nIt also enables a company to send a manager across for the purpose of setting\nup an office in the US. An L-1A visa is granted to managers and executives,\nwhereas the L-1B visa is for professionals with specialised knowledge. Recent\nyears have seen increasing scrutiny of L-1 applications \u2014 the revised guidance\nis expected to exacerbate this trend. The approval rate for L-1 visas has been\non the decline (see graphic). In fiscal 2015 (12-month period ended September\n30, 2015), as many as 33,454 L-1 visas were approved with a success rate of\n84%. The approval rate declined to 72% in fiscal 2019 with only 29,335\napprovals being granted.  \n  \nUnder the \u2018blanket\u2019 application route, a single application can be filed by a\nlarge company having overseas operations, which eliminates the need to file a\nseparate L-1 application for each employee the company wishes to transfer to\nthe US office. After approval of the blanket application, the employee\nconcerned had to present a copy of the approval notice, with the required form\nand other evidence (such as of proof of employment) to a US consular officer\nfor obtaining the [L-1\nvisa](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/L-1-visa). In India, the US\nconsulate office in Chennai deals with L-1 petitions under the blanket\napproval route.  \n  \n\u201cThe \u2018blanket\u2019 application route has been a very useful tool for large\ncompanies \u2014 particularly in the IT sector \u2014 based in India, seeking to\ntransfer executives, managers and individuals having specialised knowledge to\nthe US,\u201d Neil A Weinrib, founder and managing attorney of a New York-based law\nfirm, told TOI. Commenting on the updated guidance, he said, \u201cIt is a radical\ndeparture and could certainly lead to unfair adjudications as consular\nofficers are typically vested with enormous discretion and very limited\noversight. Further, there is no real recourse to the applicant in the event of\na visa denial.\u201d  \n  \nAn in-house immigration expert attached to an IT company said, \u201cMedium and\nlarge Indian tech companies mainly rely on H-1B visas, and to a lesser extent\non L visas. Typically, L-1visas constitute 10-15% of the H-1B visas procured\nin a year. Yet, the revised guidance is a cause for concern.\u201d  \n  \nWeinrib summed up: \u201cI would strongly advise the applicants to be intimately\nfamiliar with the entire L-1 visa petition \u2014 as well as their specific title,\nrole and job description \u2014 in order to best withstand the potential queries.\u201d\n\n  \n\n  \nMitchell Wexler, California based partner at Fragomen, a global immigration\nlaw firm told TOI, \u201cSomewhat troubling is that the guidance underscores to\nconsular officers that if questions remain after the visa interview, the\nofficer should deny the application. To that end, we are emphasizing the\nimportance of providing specific, concrete details to consular officers.\u201d\n\n  \n\n  \n\u201cFor example, for L-1B applicants could explain how their specialized\nknowledge facilitates the development of new products and services for the\ncompany. For L-1A applicants who manage people, providing organizational\ncharts of subordinate professional employees is important. It may not be\nenough to say that the L-1A applicant manages ten resources; rather, it is\nimportant to show the consular officer the titles of the subordinate employees\nand the overall group hierarchy in a visually impactful chart,\u201d explains\nWexler. Immigration attorneys cite that going forward providing concrete\nevidence will play a more crucial role in obtaining these visas.\n\n  \n\n  \nMitchell Wexler, California based partner at Fragomen, a global immigration\nlaw firm told TOI, \u201cSomewhat troubling is that the guidance underscores to\nconsular officers that if questions remain after the visa interview, the\nofficer should deny the application.

People who work throughout the healthcare\nindustry get their energy from helping patients. And although the idea of\ndedication to patient health is nothing new, what it means to really serve\npatients in the best way possible is changing rapidly and dramatically.\n\nThe ideal healthcare model is now consumer focused and delivers efficiency,\naffordability, and convenience -- largely through technological advances.\nPeople are increasingly entering the healthcare system before they become ill,\nwhich actively delays, and even prevents, the need for acute care. Patients\nare more in charge of their own healthcare decisions, including decisions on\nwhich insurance plans to participate in, where to get care, and what type of\ncare they should get. The consumer is also being defined in broader terms than\njust the patient -- families and communities are becoming stakeholders in the\npatient journey. In response, payors and providers must increasingly engage\nwith consumers throughout the entire journey.\n\n## Related stories\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/More-than-a-feeling-How-do-you-measure-culture)\n\n### [More than a feeling: How do you measure culture?](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/blog/More-than-a-feeling-How-do-you-measure-culture)\n\nby Gretchen Anderson and Caroline Smit\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/You-cant-benchmark-culture)\n\n### [You can't benchmark culture](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/You-cant-benchmark-culture)\n\nby Jon Katzenbach and Alice Zhou\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/All-the-healthcare-you-can-afford)\n\n### [All the healthcare you can afford](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/All-the-healthcare-you-can-afford)\n\nby Theodore Kinni\n\nTraditionally, health-services companies haven't been known for consumer-\ncentricity. In the [2018 Global Culture Survey](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/Closing-the-Culture-Gap) conducted by PwC's Katzenbach\nCenter, less than half of health provider and health insurance respondents\nselected consumer-centricity as one of their top three strengths. It is then\nlittle wonder that consumer-focused disruptors such as Amazon, Apple, and\nothers are entering the healthcare landscape.\n\nIn response to these trends, traditional healthcare players are investing\nheavily in capabilities to enhance the consumer experience, be it with\nconsumer-friendly apps or population health analytics. Organizations are also\nrestructuring, participating in M&A, and partnering with nonhealthcare\ncompanies. But these efforts often prove insufficient because they neglect a\nkey piece of the puzzle: culture.\n\nAlthough formal structures and processes exist on paper, culture determines\nhow things \"really get done\" within organizations. Companies can rework the\norg chart, invest in technological capabilities, and trumpet a customer-\ncentric culture on HR posters, but if the culture doesn't support the efforts\nand drive them forward, they'll never take hold.\n\n### What is a consumer-centric culture?\n\nIt's useful to think of your company's culture as its personality, complete\nwith mutually exclusive personality traits. For example, a company can be\naccepting of risk or risk averse, or somewhere in between, but it can't\ninhabit both extremes. Each extreme comes with strengths and challenges.\nMoving toward the middle mitigates some of the challenges, but it also dilutes\nthe strengths. Although there is no such thing as a perfect set of traits,\nthere are traits that are more correlated with one business strategy than with\nanother.\n\nWorking with the results of the 2018 Global Culture Survey, as well as years\nof experience and research, we've identified key culture traits that correlate\nwith consumer-centricity across industries. Cultivating a new culture that\nsupports consumer-centricity requires a balancing act between traits that\nserve other core purposes and should be kept, and those that need to be\nevolved to better meet consumer demands. These key traits are discussed below.\n\n**Externally focused/customer focused (versus internally focused).** It may\nseem obvious that a customer-centric organization needs to be driven by\nexternal forces. But when it comes to health services, especially in provider\norganizations, internal demands dominate. Such organizations often have a\nsingle-minded focus on internal compliance, best-practice benchmarks, and\nmetrics that detracts from consumer-centricity. For example, doctors in group\npractices and hospitals are required to see many patients a day, fill out\nreams of paperwork, and achieve target profitability results. It's difficult\nto practice with empathy and fully engage with a patient when a consultation\nis limited to 15 minutes and the physician spends half of that time on\ndocumentation.\n\nIt's useful to think of your company's culture as its personality, complete\nwith mutually exclusive personality traits.\n\nSome health-services players are trying a different approach, identifying ways\nto be more customer focused without compromising core standards. At Flatiron\nHealth, an electronic health records startup specializing in oncology that has\n[been acquired](https://fortune.com/2018/02/16/roche-flatiron-health-deal-why-\nit-matters/) by Roche, every few months someone living with cancer comes to\nspeak and take questions to remind employees of their mission. These efforts\ntake time and energy, because consumer-centricity requires actively connecting\neveryday activities to the ultimate mission of the organization. Done right,\nhowever, they harness intrinsic sources of motivation among staff to keep the\nconsumer at the forefront of all activities.\n\n**Flat and egalitarian (versus hierarchical).** Consumer-facing employees need\nto be empowered to make quick decisions and to manage ambiguous situations in\norder to meet consumer needs. This means decision rights need to be pushed\ndown in the organization so those closest to the consumer can make the right\nchoices for them. Conversely, a hierarchical culture in which all decisions\nand actions that deviate from the script need to be escalated to management\nfor approval is one that can't be sufficiently responsive in dealing with\nambiguous consumer situations.\n\nTake the industry's approach to prior authorizations. Before patients can get\nan expensive procedure, they must get approval from their insurance company\n(or risk having to pay for the entire procedure out of pocket). Prior\nauthorizations can be acquired quickly in some cases, or be bypassed entirely.\nBut in more complicated cases, the request may be sent to payors' medical\ndirectors or third-party vendors for a review that can take days, or even\nweeks, to process. The more hierarchical the reviewing entity, the higher the\nlikelihood that a request will need to be further escalated, and the longer\nthe process takes. But at a place where people at lower levels of the\norganization are more empowered to make decisions -- such as an authorization\nreview nurse -- routine procedures may be able to be quickly approved.\n\n**Focused on broader performance measures (versus solely on financial\nmetrics).** Through our work with health-services clients, we've demonstrated\nrepeatedly that effective customer engagement is associated with clear\nfinancial value. One regional healthcare payor estimated it would save between\nUS$560 million and $800 million by improving its consumer engagement. But this\nvalue would be generated as an outcome of numerous interactions along the\nconsumer journey, making it difficult to isolate or attribute to any one\nfactor or initiative. Whereas increasing patient volume or the speed of claims\nprocessing directly affects financial metrics, the financial impact of\nconsumer engagement efforts is less immediately observable. This means that in\ncompanies that prioritize financial metrics over all other indicators of\nperformance, championing consumer-centricity becomes a challenge. The\ncomplexity of the health-services space and the high cost of healthcare mean\nthat all players face margin pressure. That makes it tempting to build a\nculture around financial metrics -- to encourage decision making that is based\non immediate bottom-line impact.\n\n## PwC insights\n\n  * ### [Transformation in healthcare](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/healthcare/publications/transformation-in-healthcare.html?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articlebox)\n\nBut companies that excel at consumer-centricity tend to do the opposite. Take\nUnited Services Automobile Association (USAA) as a cross-industry example.\nUSAA has a reputation within the financial-services industry for strong\nconsumer-centricity serving its target constituents. Unlike many other call\ncenters, USAA employees don't rush through calls with customers and are not\nevaluated on how fast they handle the inquiries. \"Member satisfaction trumps\nevery single [other] metric,\"\n[says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-02-18/usaas-battle-plan)\nBruce Temkin, managing partner of the Temkin Group, who is known as \"The\nGodfather of CX.\" USAA is also willing to invest in projects that may benefit\nits members even if they will not have a short-term financial payoff (e.g.,\nhelping members who live from paycheck to paycheck save more).\n\nEven with the margin pressure facing today's health-services players, it is\nnecessary to look beyond black and white financial metrics to factor in the\nvalue of broader performance metrics. Value-based accountable care\norganizations, for example, often don't turn a profit in their first few\nyears. But investors know that providing consistent quality care and engaging\nconsumers in their healthcare journey will benefit patients' health, decrease\nthe number of doctor visits and medical treatments, and increase consumer\nsatisfaction -- all of which will ultimately translate into financial success.\n\n**Improvisational and comfortable with risk (versus process focused).**\nAgility -- the ability to move quickly and be adaptable -- has become a\nbuzzword. In today's health-services industry, where the ways in which people\ninteract with data and make demands on organizations are rapidly changing,\nagility is needed to deliver both performance and strong consumer-centricity.\nThe ability to be agile, however, requires a willingness to improvise, which\nis challenging in the highly regulated health-services industry. Although\nevery organization needs rules and processes, true agility requires an\nability, at both the individual and organizational level, to look beyond\nprocesses to quickly find solutions, especially when it comes to ambiguous\ninteractions.\n\nA claims adjudicator at a payor may deny a claim because of a misspelling of a\npatient's name. This can happen even though the misspelling is obviously a\nmistake. The patient calls to clarify the error but is told that the claims\nadjudicator's hands are tied. The problem here is not the rule; a rule that\nsays the name on a claim must match that in the policy makes perfect sense.\nThe problem is a culture that allows no room for discretion -- i.e., a culture\nthat is not agile.\n\nOscar Health Insurance is trying to [do things\ndifferently](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/one-startup-built-better-health-\ninsurance-magic-data/). It has developed a network that aims to be\nfunctionally stable while constantly in flux. Doctor information is updated\ndaily, and member requests that fall outside Oscar's model (e.g., needing a\nwomen's health physical therapist) can be dealt with. Oscar's network-building\nteams are comfortable not knowing all the answers, improvising as they go\nalong.\n\nAgility and improvisation, however, cannot happen without a degree of risk\ntolerance. An employee may be willing to go off-script to help a consumer, but\nonly if he or she isn't afraid of being disciplined or even fired for it.\n\nTo be sure, the health-services industry is not a naturally consumer-centric\none. In attempting to build a more consumer-centric culture, we run up against\nthe fact that healthcare must fundamentally ensure patient safety and drive\nhigh-quality outcomes. Because of this, it may be easy to dismiss these\nfindings about the importance of being externally focused, encouraging\negalitarianism, accepting risk, and focusing on a broad set of performance\nmetrics.\n\nThe view that safety within health services is directly at odds with consumer-\ncentricity is an oversimplification. The industry is not one homogeneous\nblock, and not all health-services players or professionals have the same\ndirect connection to patient safety. A customer service rep who ventures off-\nscript in a conversation with a member presents a different level of risk than\na surgeon who skips a checklist before starting a procedure. Instead of\nthinking broadly about empowerment in health services, we need to think more\ngranularly. A nuanced understanding of where risks are and are not acceptable\nis needed, as is a thorough understanding of the consumer journey and where\nemployee empowerment is most needed. Deliberate choices need to be made about\nthe interactions that are most crucial in the consumer journey, and where it's\nmost necessary to get consumer-centricity right.\n\n### How it's done\n\nIt is important not to try to \"have it all.\" Just as a company's strategy\ncan't be to serve as a low-cost provider and premium provider, trade-offs are\ninvolved in becoming more consumer-centric. Prioritization and focus are\ncritical to consumer-centricity. Rather than launching large-scale change\nprograms that attempt to fundamentally reshape an organization, it's important\nto identify and execute on the basics -- to focus on a narrow set of\npriorities and to do that well.\n\nFrom a culture perspective, these changes usually start with identifying a\ncritical few behaviors that aid consumer-centricity, and then translating them\ninto specific action items for different parts of the organization. For\ninstance, many organizations struggle because their culture lacks employee\nempowerment and accountability. This could cause a patient with an atypical\nquestion to be bounced from department to department, or a technician who sees\nan error on a scrip to assume that it's not his or her place to question the\ndoctors. A critical behavior in this case should be related to taking\nownership over delivery of results rather than just completion of tasks. This\nbehavior encourages agility and improvisation, as well as external customer\nfocus. For customer service representatives, this could mean listening closely\nin order to fully understand a caller's situation and then proposing a novel\nsolution or anticipating a future need. For a head nurse, this could mean\ntalking during meetings about lives comforted and pain relieved rather than\nbed turnover times.\n\n\n\nGet the _strategy+business_ newsletter delivered to your inbox\n\n([sample](https://www.strategy-business.com/nl20180417))\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nA lack of communication and collaboration is another common pain point that\ninhibits consumer-centricity. To address this issue, a hospital that we worked\nwith chose as one of its critical behaviors \"take a moment to explain your\nrationale.\" Again, this applied differently to surgeons and to hospital\nadministrators. Surgeons would not pause in the middle of a tense operation to\nexplain what they were going to do next, but hospital administrators would be\nexpected to explain a staffing decision.\n\nSuccessful behavior evolution also requires an organizational ecosystem that\nis coherent. This means that formal enablers (e.g., decision rights, rewards,\nand incentives) and informal enablers (e.g., norms, informal relationships)\nneed to be aligned with the behavior traits the organization is trying to\ndrive. Thus, if your goal is to drive consumer-centricity but you evaluate\nyour call center reps solely on the number of calls they answer, you need to\nreevaluate these incentives.\n\nTechnology and digital tools can be an important enabler of the right critical\nbehaviors. For example, although we can conceptually talk about risk and the\nlevel of discretion/empowerment various players along the consumer journey\nshould have, technology can quantify this risk and help determine where the\nguardrails should be set. Similarly, utilizing data to quantify the value\nassociated with specific consumer experience levers enables an organization to\nadopt a broader set of performance measures beyond direct financial metrics.\nAll of this allows an organization to move closer to the ideal consumer-\ncentric culture. The important point here is that IT-related initiatives\nshould complement culture-related efforts. Coherence is key.\n\n### Room to evolve\n\nA hospital is not a retail store or hotel. Health services as an industry may\nnever achieve the kind of consumer-centricity that treats customer whims as\nsacred and immediate gratification as the holy grail -- and it shouldn't aim\nto. But there is room for health-services organizations to evolve their\nculture to support and accelerate efforts to be increasingly consumer-centric.\n\nIn a consumer-centric health-services ecosystem, senior doctors should still\ncite their experience and qualifications to push back on patient demands that\nwill compromise the quality of care (e.g., recommending a safer procedure\nversus a quicker one); a nurse doing her rounds should, however, feel\nempowered to share a healthy snack from the break room with a hungry patient.\n\nThe ideal organization is intuitively responsive to consumer needs, and is one\nin which employees navigate ambiguous situations and make the right, consumer-\ncentric choices most of the time.\n\n## Author Profiles:\n\n  * **[Jaime Estupi\u00f1an](mailto:jaime.estupinan@pwc.com)** is a New York-based principal with PwC US, where he advises health clients on market-driven strategies and agile organization transformations.

It can be an exhausting\nand disappointing experience for all involved.\n\nI have found that this yo-yo effect is most often experienced in organizations\nthat make the following four team development mistakes.\n\n**1.  **     **Team development is treated as an event instead of a process.**\n\nTeam development is too often reactionary, usually requested by well-\nintentioned leaders who want to address the issues dogging their team.\nUnfortunately, the one-and-done approach to improving team performance does\nnot work. A session once a year, with no process to support the behavioral\nchange necessary for real performance improvement, will not work.  For lasting\nchange in team effectiveness to be achieved, the following is essential:\n\n  * A process that enables continuous improvement and team development to occur during the team\u2019s daily work so that it becomes part of the culture.\n  * Clear and accurate understanding of the team\u2019s needs and current barriers to improved performance.\n  * Input from team members regarding the team\u2019s strengths and most critical opportunities for improvement. \n  * The right learning, tools, and approach that will support team members in addressing their specific challenges. \n  * A means to measure improvement in team effectiveness over time.\n  * Opportunities for the team to celebrate and recognize team achievements and strengths while continuing to identify, and act on, opportunities for improvement through constructive feedback.\n  * A commitment by the team and leader to an ongoing team development process where the team checks-in at least monthly on progress.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n **2.  **     **There is no consistent definition of what a High-Performance\nTeam looks like across the organization.**\n\n> When organizations make great teams their primary focus \u2013 including what\n> creates them and what can fracture them \u2013 we expect to see more significant\n> rises in Global Engagement.\n>\n> Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019\n\nWithout a clear definition, and understanding, of what a high performance team\nlooks like, teams and their OD and HR supports will waste time and energy\nfocusing on improving areas that will have little effect on the root causes\npreventing the team from working at their very best. In addition,\norganizations will miss out on the opportunity to communicate a consistent\nmessage to all teams regarding the [specific non-negotiable behaviors that\nmust show up for exceptional performance](https://teamfitnesstool.com/ebook/).\nClear and consistent expectations matter. When all of your teams and leaders\nknow exactly what they need to focus on to be even better together, and all of\nyour teams are pulling together in that same direction, you\u2019ll see not only an\nimprovement in team dynamics and performance, but an [improvement in\nengagement and results as well.](https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-\ninsights/articles/g/global-study-of-engagement-technical-report.aspx)\n\n**3.      Team development is done _to_ the team instead of _by_ the team.**\n\nThe ability to tap into the vital power of teams must be placed into the hands\nof the leader and their team, and not rest solely with OD and HR. As I shared\nin the article [The Results Are In And Current Employee Engagement Strategies\nAren\u2019t Working](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolebendaly/2019/09/07/the-\nresults-are-in-current-employee-engagement-strategies-arent-working-heres-\nwhat-does/#2c5d957f40f9), if you are relying solely on HR and OD to develop\ngreat teams, your organization will fall behind on improving both engagement\nand team performance. Organizations that thrive today are made up of nimble,\nhigh performing teams that use [real-time data about their team\u2019s\neffectiveness](https://teamfitnesstool.com/) to shift their actions and\nbehaviors in a direction that is most meaningful to the team and their\nresults.  For this to happen though, leaders and their teams must have a set\nof tools to measure and develop their team\u2019s effectiveness. Effective tools\ndefine what exceptional teamwork looks like and provide the team with the\nability to act, affect behavior change, and create the dialogue required to\nmove the team forward.\n\n**4.      A lack of understanding of the teams that need support. **\n\n> Organizations must be able to see, support, and measure teamwork.\n>\n> Hayes, Chumney, Wright & Buckingham, 2019\n\nOrganizations are no longer made up solely of teams that show up on an\norganizational chart. Teams are more fluid and dynamic than ever; work gets\ndone in cross-functional project teams and committees; and yet unfortunately\n[75% of cross-functional teams](https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-\nfunctional-teams-are-dysfunctional) are dysfunctional. To effectively improve\nteam performance across an organization, HR/OD must know where the work is\nactually happening and have a line of site into the myriad of teams that pop-\nup within the organization to get work done. This of course is easier said\nthan done, which brings me back to #3 above, ensuring leaders are armed with\nthe right tools to effectively measure and improve team performance, no matter\nthe type of team they are leading, or for how long the team will be together.  \n\nThe responsibility to improve and sustain team performance must lie with your\nleaders and teams, and not with OD/HR. The question I will leave you with then\nis: are you providing all of your teams and leaders with the right tools,\nprocesses and knowledge to address their specific needs and challenges in a\nmeaningful way?\n\n  \n\n_Gain specific tools to improve your team\u2019s performance with my upcoming_[\n_complimentary\nwebinar_](http://createsend.com/t/j-E8DB56DFC84B0B5A2540EF23F30FEDED) _.\nConnect with me on  _[ _Twitter_](https://www.twitter.com/nicolebendaly) _  or\n_[ _LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolebendaly/) _, let\u2019s start a\nconversation!_\n\n[![Nicole\nBendaly](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74490b421a5561dfa08fb6b5d96bc7e0?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolebendaly/\n\"Photo of Nicole Bendaly\")\n\n[Nicole Bendaly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolebendaly/)\n\nI\u2019ve spent more than 20 years helping teams and leaders tap into the very best\nof themselves.
