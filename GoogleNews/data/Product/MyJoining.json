Pradesh leader Jyotiraditya Scindia tendered his resignation\non March 10, speculations of other Congress leaders such as Shashi Tharoor\nstarted making the rounds.\n\nA Twitter user, Drunk Journalist, named two Congress leaders who he said will\nsoon jump ship. \"My next two bets who will be joining BJP soon 1) Milind Deora\n2) Shashi Tharoor,\" the user\u2019s tweet said.\n\n> My next

Sabha, hit back.\n\n\"If you were sober, @drunkjournalist, you wouldn\u2019t have my name on your list,\"\nTharoor\u2019s replied.\n\nHours later, a Malayalam news website carried a story speculating that Tharoor\nwould follow Scindia's suit. In another tweet, he quoted the report and said:\n\"Not amused by the silly speculation about my joining @BJP4India. I entered\npolitics not as a careerist but to advance principles I have articulated for\nnearly four decades. Check my paper trail! My record speaks for itself.

March 25, 2020 at 11:21\na.m.\n\nU.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Christian Miranda is serving at the\nInformation Warrior Training Command (IWTC) in San Diego.\n\nHe is an information systems technician responsible for training sailors on\nhow to use satellites on ships for communication purposes, according to a\npress release from the Navy.\n\n\u201cTraining students here helps me keep my skills on point,\u201d Miranda said in the\npress release. \u201cIf you don\u2019t use something often you lose it. Teaching\nstudents keeps my skills sharp.\u201d\n\nFor Miranda, serving in the Navy is a family tradition.\n\n\u201cMy father was in the Navy for 30 years,\u201d Miranda said in the press release.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s service played a huge factor in my joining. I always wanted to\nfollow in his footsteps and as a man.\u201d\n\nMiranda graduated in 2008 from Citrus Hills High School in Perris.\n\n_Have your own military accomplishment to share?

Last week, she succumbed to\ncancer at 65.\n\nby [ Miko Peled ](https://www.mintpressnews.com/author/miko-peled/)\n\nMarch 31st, 2020\n\nBy [ **Miko Peled** ](https://www.mintpressnews.com/author/miko-peled/)\n\nComments\n\n**A mman, Jordan -- **\u201cI didn\u2019t join the Palestinian resistance because I\nexperienced suffering, I joined out of a sense of patriotism,\u201d Theresa Halasa,\na revered veteran of the Palestinian resistance said this in an\n[interview](http://learnpalestine.politics.ox.ac.uk/cadres) in 2009. Halasa\ndied in Amman on March 28, 2020, after succumbing to cancer. She was 65 years\nold.\n\nIn 1972, Halasa was one of four Palestinians who hijacked a Belgian Sabena\nairliner en route to Tel-Aviv. The objective was to keep the passengers\nhostage until the Israeli government agreed to release Palestinians held in\nIsrael prisons. However, less than 24 hours after landing in Tel-Aviv, Israeli\ncommandos stormed the plane dressed as technicians. They immediately killed\ntwo of the hijackers and captured the other two, Halasaamong them. Two of the\ncommanders that led the raid were Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu was slightly injured in the arm by a bullet during the raid. Israel\nclaims it was from friendly fire, the Palestinians claim it was Halasa who\ncaused the injury. Either way, it was no more than a flesh wound.\n\n\n\n## A Palestinian Patriot\n\nTheresa Halasa was born in Palestine in 1954, not far from Akka in the\nbeautiful town of Al-Rameh in the Upper Galilee. She studied nursing in\nNazareth, and as a student, she joined Maki, the Israeli Communist Party which\nat that time was the political home to many activist Palestinian citizens of\nIsrael. \u201cI received my patriotism from my father,\u201d she says repeatedly. \u201cWe\ndid not suffer, suffering was not the cause for my joining the struggle, it\nwas the sense of patriotism I received from my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a romantic notion that I would find the resistance in the streets, but\nthat's not where it was. There was no resistance in the streets,\u201d Halasa says,\n\u201cI had to go to Lebanon,\u201d which at the time was the center of the Palestinian\nresistance. \u201cI made the decision to leave for Lebanon in January, 1971,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\n![Therese Halaseh](https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-\nload/images/1x1.trans.gif)![Therese Halaseh](https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/AP_7208140207_edited.jpg)\n\nTherese Halasa, right, and Rima Issa Tannous, left, hear the reading of their\nlife sentences at their trial on August 14, 1972. Castro | AP\n\nHalasa left home without telling her family. She proceeded north towards\nKiryat Shmona, an Israeli city near the Lebanese border, then to Matala, (the\nIsraeli colony of Metula) and from there she crossed the border into Lebanon.\n\u201cThe trip, which would normally take an hour and a half, took me three nights\nand two days.\u201d She arrived in Marj Ayun hungry and exhausted and from there\nshe was led to a Fateh camp where she was questioned for several days.\n\n\u201cI had a few months of training with weapons and explosives and then had to\nswallow the news that I was selected for an operation.\u201d The hijacking was\nplanned by Ali Hasan Salame who headed the Palestinian \u201cBlack September\u201d\ngroup.\n\n\n\n## Armed Resistance\n\nHalasa never regretted participating in the highjacking, even though it came\nat great cost to her and her comrades. Two Palestinians were killed and she\nwas injured. Furthermore, she and another female hijacker, Rima Tanous, were\ntried by an Israeli military court, convicted and sentenced to several\nlifetimes in prison. Both women would eventually be released in prisoner\nexchanges. Halasa ended up serving twelve years in an Israeli prison after\nwhich she was exiled to Jordan.\n\nIt is hard to say for sure what type of training she and the others received\nbefore embarking on this operation, but based on her testimony, it only lasted\na few months. One can assume they learned how to operate small arms, machine\nguns, and hand grenades, and how to make explosives. One thing of which we can\nbe sure is that the resources the Palestinian resistance had were not enough\nto prepare her and her comrades to face the Israeli army, much less an elite\ncommando unit.\n\nAn Israeli combat soldier will go through many months of grueling basic\ntraining, after which the real work of learning to be a professional soldier\nbegins. The resources Israel has are far superior and its soldiers are far\nbetter trained, equipped and even better fed than anything the Palestinian\nresistance could ever have hoped for. Consequently, when the Palestinian\nresistance fighters faced the Israeli commandos or even regular soldiers, the\nsaga always ended swiftly with the Palestinians paying the heavier price.\n\nIsrael made sure that its military was always superior to any other military\nin the region. Since Palestinians have never had more than armed guerrilla\nforces, which cannot compare to a regular army, Israel always had the upper\nhand.\n\n\n\n## Israeli Oppression\n\nIn an\n[interview](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/politics/2020/3/28/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A9)\nwith _Aljazeera_ , Halasa said she believed that Palestine will only be\nreturned to its people by the force of resistance, a claim that Israel has\nproven to be true over and over again. What this resistance will look like is,\nof course, another question. Israel has purposely made it impossible to\nresolve the Palestine question peaceably and without confrontation. As the\nyears go by, the oppression, the killing, and the dispossession of Palestinian\nhave become more entrenched.\n\n![Therese Halaseh funeral ](https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![Therese Halaseh funeral\n](https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/36a61583-85ba-4ea8-9bd6-ca3fb576f5e0-1_edited.jpg)\n\nTheresa Halasa is laid to rest in Amman, Jordan\n\nPalestinian efforts at armed resistance and at negotiating have cost the\nPalestinians dearly and yielded no positive results. The only option left is\nto pursue dedicated, uncompromising campaigns of boycotts, divestment and\nsanctions. Israel must be isolated, its ambassadors must be sent home and all\ncountries must call their ambassadors back from Tel-Aviv. The campaign must\nalso demand an end to Israeli participation in the Olympic Games, the World\nCup, all academic, cultural, sporting events must be closed to Israel.\n\nTheresa Halasa did not live to see her homeland liberated. She stepped up and\nwas willing to pay the price and indeed she paid a price for her patriotism,\nbut the ultimate goal was not achieved. One hopes that she will be remembered\nand that the lessons of her experience will be shared widely so that all of us\nwho are alive today will see her dream of a free Palestine become a reality.\n\nFeature photo | An Israeli grabs the arm of Theresa Halasa, her arm wounded\nwhen Israeli troops attacked the Sabena jet held captive by Palestinian\nguerrillas at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 9, 1972.\nPhoto | AP\n\n_**Miko Peled** is an author and human rights activist born in Jerusalem.

new series, \u201cGirls Room,\u201d following the\nrelease of the show\u2019s trailer last week. On Wednesday, Waithe took to twitter\nto respond, saying that she didn\u2019t rip the storyline from Atlanta screenwriter\n**Nina Lee**. \u201cPrior to my joining the project in 2017, a Dove partner came up\nwith the title and concept from which my scripts were based,\u201d Waithe said. \u201cI\nwas brought on to write the scripts and produce the content. I have never seen\nNina Lee\u2019s work nor would I ever steal another artist\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a creative myself, I can only imagine how she must be feeling and I look\nto #Dove to give us more clarity on the situation,\u201d Waithe added.\n\n**Sources:[Rollingstone.com](http://Rollingstone.com),\n[Twitter.com](http://Twitter.com), [Tylerperry.com](http://Tylerperry.com),\n[hotnewhiphop.com](http://hotnewhiphop.com)**\n\nYou must be logged in to react.  \nClick any reaction to login.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stlamerican.com%2Fentertainment%2Fhot_sheet%2Flena-waithe-denies-stealing-show-concept-looks-to-dove-brand-for-answers%2Farticle_509a7c84-5e92-11ea-85ed-7f6d7b123256.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Lena%20Waithe%20denies%20stealing%20show%20concept%2C%20looks%20to%20Dove%20brand%20for%20answers&via=stlouisamerican&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stlamerican.com%2Fentertainment%2Fhot_sheet%2Flena-waithe-denies-stealing-show-concept-looks-to-dove-brand-for-answers%2Farticle_509a7c84-5e92-11ea-85ed-7f6d7b123256.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Tweet\")\n  * [ __ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=http://www.stlamerican.com/entertainment/hot_sheet/lena-waithe-denies-stealing-show-concept-looks-to-dove-brand-for-answers/article_509a7c84-5e92-11ea-85ed-7f6d7b123256.html \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ __ SMS ](sms:?body=Check%20out%20this%20link:%20www.stlamerican.com/tncms/asset/editorial/509a7c84-5e92-11ea-85ed-7f6d7b123256 \"SMS\")\n  * [ __ Email ](mailto:?subject=%5BSt.%20Louis%20American%5D%20Lena%20Waithe%20denies%20stealing%20show%20concept%2C%20looks%20to%20Dove%20brand%20for%20answers&body=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stlamerican.com%2Fentertainment%2Fhot_sheet%2Flena-waithe-denies-stealing-show-concept-looks-to-dove-brand-for-answers%2Farticle_509a7c84-5e92-11ea-85ed-7f6d7b123256.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * [Lena Waithe](/search/?k=%22lena%20waithe%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Concept](/search/?k=%22concept%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Dove](/search/?k=%22dove%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Cinema](/search/?k=%22cinema%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Art](/search/?k=%22art%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Literature](/search/?k=%22literature%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Show](/search/?k=%22show%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Nina Lee](/search/?k=%22nina%20lee%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Stealing](/search/?k=%22stealing%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Producer](/search/?k=%22producer%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Writer](/search/?k=%22writer%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Post a comment as\n\nEmoticons\n\n  * [smile]\n  * [beam]\n  * [wink]\n  * [sad]\n  * [cool]\n  * [innocent]\n  * [rolleyes]\n  * [whistling]\n  * [lol]\n  * [huh]\n  * [tongue]\n  * [love]\n  * [sleeping]\n  * [yawn]\n  * [unsure]\n  * [angry]\n  * [blink]\n  * [crying]\n  * [ohmy]\n  * [scared]\n  * [sleep]\n  * [sneaky]\n  * [tongue_smile]\n  * [thumbdown]\n  * [thumbup]\n  * [censored]\n  * [happybirthday]\n  * [ban]\n  * [spam]\n  * [offtopic]\n  * [batman]\n  * [ninja]\n  * [pirate]\n  * [alien]\n\nComment Text\n\nCancel\n\nPost comment\n\n\u00d7\n\nYour comment has been submitted.\n\n__\n\n![]()\n\n****\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Report\n\nCancel\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\u00d7\n\nReported\n\n\u00d7\n\nThere was a problem reporting this.\n\n\u00d7\n\n####  Watch this discussion.

days\n\nBy Shama Bhagat\n\n  * Published 18.03.20, 5:50 PM\n  * Updated 18.03.20, 5:50 PM\n\n  * 2 mins read\n  * __\n\n__\n\n\n\n![Mahie Gill in a still

Source: The film\n\nAfter hard-hitting roles in _Gulaal_ , _Dev D_ , _Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster_ and\n_Posham Pa_ , actress Mahie Gill said she feels lucky to be in the right place\nat the right time.\n\nThe actress, who starred in Gagan Puri\u2019s light-hearted romantic film\n_Doordarshan_ last month, said: \u201cThis is the best time for Bollywood. I feel I\nam lucky and I am in the right place and I am getting powerful roles.\n_Doordarshan_ was a sweet light-hearted film and I was looking for something\nlike this for a long time. I was being offered the typical sensuous roles and\nI was tired of them. I wanted a change, and took this up.\n\n\u201cI also have an American film coming up titled _Orphan Train_ (by director\nTrisha Ray). I play an environment protection agent Helen Prost, who saves\nkidnapped immigrant children. It\u2019s a very interesting role. There\u2019s\n_Durgavati_ , a remake of the Telugu horror film _Bhaagamathie_ , starring\nBhumi Pednekar. I am enjoying doing different roles.\u201d\n\n![Mahie\nGill](https://static.telegraphindia.com/library/THE_TELEGRAPH/image/2020/3/dd31f38b-feb4-4dbf-8c9a-0b869833f14a.jpg)\n__ Mahie Gill (Fotocorp)\n\nHer strength, she said, in playing strong women roles comes from her mother.\n\n\u201cMy mother brought us up single-handedly. She had a doctorate in entomology\n(study of insects) and was a lecturer in college. She was a strong woman. I\nwas never attached to my father. He was a good man and he helped a lot of\npeople but he never helped his own family. He was against my joining theatre.\nHe was a deputy economic adviser and a popular man in our town but he died\nearly as he was an alcoholic. After his death I came to know that he would\nshow my pictures to his friends and praise my work a lot. But he never did\nthat in front of me. As children we never bonded with him.\u201d\n\nHer role in _Doordarshan_ , which released on February 28, took Mahie back to\nher school days.\n\n\u201cIt reminded me how I got punished when I was late. I had great respect for my\nteachers and I am still in touch with them. After school when I went to a\nhostel during college, I started watching a lot of films. I was crazy about\nmovies. I bagged gold in masters in theatres. I was a topper. I used to remain\nbusy with NCC and French classes and my mother made sure that I was busy all\nday, yet I made time for the movies. I don\u2019t remember much but my friends tell\nme that I danced very well.\u201d\n\nMahie said so far, she has had a very satisfying journey in Bollywood.\n\n\u201cThat does not mean I am giving up work. I want to do good roles, the kind\nMeryl Streep does in Hollywood. I have become choosy.\n\n\u201cAs a kid in Chandigarh I would drink warm milk and cuddle in my blanket and\nwatch the Filmfare awards. I never imagined that I would win that award some\nday. By being satisfied I meant that I have respect for the roles that I have\ndone. I am happy. There is no end to greed. The more you wish, the more you\nwant but I think God has given me more than what I expected. I have a good\nshelf life and I am proud of the films I have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to going home these days as my daughter is growing up. I love\nto listen to her chatter and play with her. She is naughty, intelligent and is\npicking up a lot of things. She keeps me busy and that\u2019s why I run home after\nmy shoots. Apart from that I am renovating my house and I am busy with that,\u201d\nshe added.\n\nTags\n\n  * [Chandigarh](/topic/chandigarh)\n  * [school](/topic/school)\n  * [Mahie Gill](/topic/mahie-gill)\n\n###### Download  \nTT App\n\n[ ![Download From App Store](/assets/images/ios_download.jpg)\n](https://apple.co/2WlmuBG)  \n[ ![Download From Google Play](/assets/images/and_download.jpg)\n](https://bit.ly/2XmCwYr)\n\nTrending\n\n  1.

Turner was 91.  \n  \nMr. Turner was born in Marshall in 1928. He graduated from Marshall High\nSchool in 1946 and earned a bachelor of science in education degree in 1951\nfrom Wilmington College. He received his master's in education from Ohio\nUniversity in 1958.  \n  \nMr. Turner served in the United States Army in the 101st Airborne and the\nEighth Army Medics.  \n  \nHe began his teaching career at New Petersburg in 1949. After a decade of\nteaching, he became an assistant elementary school principal in 1959. Later,\nhe was named the principal of Edward Lee McClain High School from 1966-79,\nfrom where retired after 30 years of service in education.  \n  \nOne of his former students, Pat Hays, owner of WVNU Radio, shared his thoughts\non Mr. Turner with The Highland County Press.  \n  \n\"I was so saddened to learn today of the passing of Harry Turner,\" Hays said.\n\"Mr. Turner certainly had an impact on thousands of young lives during his\ntenure at McClain High School, including me.  \n  \n\"His encouragement in my joining the Junior Projectionist Club and doing video\nand public address, was a boost to me in my eventual career in radio. His\nearly morning address to the students always started out every day with two\nthumps on the microphone, the pledge of allegiance and the recitation of the\nLord's prayer. A stern but fair man, he embodied the definition of a true\nteacher with his love for learning and the love of his students.  \n  \n\"Godspeed, Mr. Turner, and when we meet again, I may need a hall pass.\"  \n  \nAfter three decades in education, Mr. Turner continued to serve. He worked for\nthe Kenworthy Seed Company, sold real estate, and was the director of Adult\nEducation at the Laurel Oaks Vocational School. He also was the first\nexecutive director of the Highland County Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"Harry Turner made a huge impact on thousands of Great Oaks/Laurel Oaks\nstudents, their families and the communities they called home,\" said Harry\nSnyder, President & CEO of Great Oaks Career Campuses. \"Harry was involved in\nhis community of Greenfield through several clubs, committees and nonprofits.\nI believe Harry's involvement in the local Greenfield Rotary Club demonstrated\nhis life of 'service above self.'\"\n\n\"I am so sorry to hear of Harry's passing. He was one of the first people I\nmet when my family moved to Greenfield,\" former Highland County Prosecutor Jim\nGrandey said. \"I had the utmost respect for his opinions and always enjoyed\ntalking with him. He surely will be missed.\"  \n  \nFormer Greenfield City Manager Ron Coffey shared similar thoughts.  \n  \n\"Our community has lost a friend who championed education and always worked\nfor the greater good,\" Coffey said. \"Among Mr. Turner's many activities was\nhis service in the Greenfield Rotary Club since 1972, which made him the\nsenior member of our club. Mr. Turner embodied the ideals of Rotary and put\nservice above self. He will be greatly missed.\"  \n  \n\"I knew Mr. Turner many years ago when The Press Gazette was publishing its\n175th anniversary edition,\" Highland County Press publisher Rory Ryan said.\n\"Harry and Betty were dressed in period costume from 1818 and posed for the\nfront-page artwork. Former publisher Phil Roberts coordinated the effort along\nwith Don McCullough and Liz Johnson. Harry was also very involved with local\neconomic development in a countywide effort.\"  \n  \nMr. Turner's community involvement also included being a Greenfield Rotarian\nalmost 50 years. He was a member of the Greenfield Church of Christ for 60\nyears and a member of the Greenfield Historical Society; past member of the\nHighland County Historical Society; and a volunteer at the Paint Creek Pioneer\nFarm for five years.\n\n\"Mr. Turner had an outstanding career as an educator in the McClain school\nsystem,\" former Greenfield Mayor and Ohio Senator David Daniels told _The\nHighland County Press._ \"He was respected by the students and faculty alike.\nIt wasn't until I had the opportunity to work with him as an adult with the\nHighland County Chamber of Commerce that I fully appreciated his kind nature\nand sense of humor. He was a true public servant and community leader. An\nentire generation of McClain graduates will mourn his passing.\"  \n  \nMr. Turner is survived by his wife, Betty, and their four children: Sally\n(Dana) Kennedy of Mentor, Ohio, Jenny of Bradley, Ill., Jerry of Greenfield\nand Larry (Lynn) of Denver, Colo. Harry and Betty have one grandson, Andy\nKennedy of Mentor.  \n  \nMr. Turner's funeral service will be webcast through the funeral home's\nwebsite, www.ebrightfuneralhome.com, at 11 a.m. Friday, March 27. Memorial\ncontributions may be made to the Greenfield Church of Christ, 955 W. Jefferson\nStreet, Greenfield 45123.\n\nSubmit a comment\n\n* indicates a required field\n\nPlease fill out the form below to submit a comment.\n\nComment *\n\nYour Name\n\nEmail\n\nPhone\n\nArticle comments are not posted immediately to the Web site.

State and local officials are urging people to request an\nabsentee ballot so that polling locations are visited by as few people as\npossible.\n\nThe deadline to request an absentee ballot be sent by mail is today. Voters\ncan request a ballot online through [MyVote\nWisconsin](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/) or by mailing, emailing or faxing\ntheir municipal clerk\u2019s office. These requests must be accompanied by a copy\nof your photo ID. That ballot must be received by your clerk\u2019s office or at\nyour regular polling place by 8 p.m. April 7.\n\n###  **Bill Schlei**\n\n **Age:** 62\n\n **Current employment:** Account executive at WOMT\n\n **Political experience:** Former aide to governor, on Citizen Action\ncommittees in two states from 1993 to 2017 (Illinois and Wisconsin)\n\n **Years resided in Manitowoc County:** 25\n\n **Why are you running for this office?** To be a more progressive voice on\nthe council.\n\n **What sets you apart from your opponent?** While canvasing the district, I\nhave found that many of the constituents don\u2019t even know who their alderperson\nis. I have been reaching out in person, online and on social media to let\npeople know who I am and what I believe. If you aren\u2019t communicating with the\nconstituents, how can you say you are representing their interests?\n\n **How do you plan to interact with your constituents?** I have spent a lot of\ntime walking the district and knocking on doors to talk to folks. I also have\na Facebook page (Bill Schlei for Alderperson District 8) and an email address\n(friendsofbillschlei.com) that allow me to communicate with folks and they, in\nturn, can easily talk back about whatever they like.\n\n **What would you like to see change in the Common Council?** I think there\nneeds to be some tough decisions made about infrastructure, specifically\nstreet repair. Also, the program designed to remove blighted buildings needs\nto be reviewed to see if we can either accelerate these demolitions or provide\nincentives for local contractors to take these sites and make them livable,\nsaleable and then taxable again.\n\n **What was the Common Council\u2019s worst decision in the past year and why?** I\ncan\u2019t really single out one decision. But it was brought to my attention that\nthe city can approve any expenditure under $25,000 pretty much carte blanche.\nIf that is the case, there may have been a number of not-so-great decisions.\nThat\u2019s something I plan to look into.\n\n **What was the Common Council\u2019s best decision in the past year and why?**\nPurchasing the property adjacent to Hecker Road and Viebahn Street, without\nquestion. I think in the next couple of years that will pay huge dividends.\n\n###  **Michael Williams**\n\n **Current employment:** I am retired to the extent that I no longer work for\nwages, but I volunteer extensively in the community. I bring a positive\nmessage to school children, nonprofit organizations and displaced workers who\nfell victim to local companies seeking greener pastures elsewhere.\n\n **Political experience:** I was an instructor at LTC and have subbed at area\nschools. I am an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. I was\nelected to two terms as mayor of my hometown of Ripon. I served on various\nboards and commissions in Ripon and Fond du Lac while living there. I moved to\nManitowoc in 1986 and have adopted her as my second \"hometown.\" I have served\non the board of MARCO, Inc. That was a special honor for a grateful recovering\nalcoholic.\n\n **Years resided in Manitowoc County:** Since 1986\n\n **Why are you running for this office?** I enjoy the interaction with people\nwho sometimes need a liaison to interact with city officials or to provide an\ninterested listener when they have opinions to express about what's happening\nin the city. I am a good listener, and I believe a good problem-solver.\n\n **What sets you apart from your opponent?** I don't know anything about my\nopponent except I'm glad I didn't have to pay for his yard signs.\n\n **What would you like to see change in the Common Council?** I hope the more\nrecent alders, myself included, will use their common sense and input from\nconstituents to make decisions and not feel intimidated or disregarded by\nthose who have made the council their own. I believe we are elected because of\nwhat we bring to the council and not because we go along to get along.\n\n **What was the Common Council\u2019s worst decision in the past year and why?**\nPurchasing the CN Peninsula was initiated prior to my joining the council. I\nwonder if it will end up being a wise choice for us to have spent $800,000\njust to purchase this land and an unknown amount more to make it usable. I was\nthe only vote against this purchase.\n\n **What was the Common Council\u2019s best decision in the past year and why?** I\nbelieve the best move made by the city was recognizing that we needed to have\nmore land to sustain additional growth beyond our rapidly filling industrial\npark. The land being purchased now in our existing park was purchased by the\ncity decades ago. We made a good move anticipating the need for additional\nland in the future.\n\n _Contact Alisa Schafer at 920-686-2105 or aschafer@gannett.com.

It is asserted\nthat people would prefer being told the truth of their predicament, not to be\nshielded from it. \"It is now time to tell the whole truth, including the good,\nthe bad and the ugly of the ramifications of COVID-19 on the silent heroes who\nwill keep us supplied and alive in this unprecedented global crisis,\" says\nHammond.\n\n**Editorial by David Hammond, CEO of Human Rights at Sea**\n\nReporting for seven years without fear or favor, Human Rights at Sea continues\nto independently highlight the detailed plight of seafarers and fishers\nworking at the front-end keeping our global supply chains open with food on\nour tables, goods delivered and raw materials for manufacturing industries\nflowing.\n\nRightly alongside our respective State emergency services, armed forces and\nfrontline critical care workers, seafarers are our savors for those of us\nfortunate enough to receive goods delivered by sea during this COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nMeantime, globally, there will be thousands of humans who will not be so lucky\nto receive such support. Let us not ignore them just because it may be a\ndifficult consideration or far away from one's own reality.\n\nThe high-levels of eventual casualties of COVID-19, besides those reported\nthroughout Europe and China, will most likely be reflected in those living in\nthe developing world, those trapped in immigration and asylum centers, those\nin need of UN feeding programs, those moving on global migratory routes\nfleeing wars, oppression, sexual servitude, slavery and trafficking and\nunaccompanied minors.\n\nIn better times, such casualties of circumstance may well have been the focus\nof corporate social responsibility programs enhancing commercial image and the\n\"ticking of the social welfare box.\"\n\nFor the maritime sector, such casualties may include crew (and passengers) who\nare asymptomatic with no reported symptoms but are still contagious, are\nunlucky enough to become ill ashore, or become ill in an enclosed vessel which\nis then prevented either temporarily or permanently from gaining port entry,\nor from obtaining timely-resupply of essential medical supplies and therefore\nessential succor.\n\nArguably, it is not going to be too long before yellow flags are flown on\ncommercial vessels denoting the ship is under quarantine; but who will report\nthis publicly preventing it being hidden behind corporate or flag State veils?\nWho will track the consequences for those it affects?\n\n**The Current Narrative**\n\nWhat we are currently seeing portrayed through established media and social\nmedia outlets is an unbalanced advancing of the corporate \"seafarers will not\nleave their posts\" stoic narrative. But this is not balanced, nor is it\nentirely correct. Much is going on that is yet unreported.\n\nMeantime, the current public narrative fails to address, in any detail, the\nvery real hardships of the many seafarers who underpin commercial maritime\ndevelopment and its profit. This most probably relates to the inconvenient and\nuncomfortable truth of the current situation.\n\nThat said, not everyone in the industry is towing the party line.\n\nOn March 25, The New York Times issued a telling article \"Trapped at Sea by\nCovid-19 Lockdowns, Crew Members Plead for Help\" which was contributed to by\nnumerous leading maritime industry figures, including Frank Coles, CEO of Hong\nKong based Wallem Group, who previously has systematically challenged the\nmaritime industry dystopian structures, as well as myself who was separately\nasked to provide evidence and access to seafarers suffering at the present\ntime. At that time our NGO had been deluged with pleas for help, despite it\nnot being a welfare organization.\n\n**Evidence and Transparency**\n\nBy way of evidence of \"bad examples,\" below are some of the statements and\ninformation sent by seafarers who have contacted Human Rights at Sea, some in\nfear of their jobs and black-listing should they speak out. It should be noted\nthat welfare organizations and unions must be in receipt of the same, though\nmany times more.\n\n\u2022 \"I cannot disclose the company or ship name. I don't know what action will\nbe taken against me\u2026they could have arranged sign off but they did not. Now\nthere is no way to go home.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Sir. Many of us completed our tenure but can't go home due to lock down\nsituation worldwide and in [our]home country. Moreover we are being sent for\n[to] highly affected EU countries. Panic is there onboard as well as at home.\nIn this severe situation we would like to be with our families to support\nthem. Company appreciated us for keeping up supply chain worldwide but who is\ngoing to take care of us and our family??\"\n\n\u2022 \"I am stranded in Hotel since 4th March on Tunisia and you aware I came to\njoin ship. I don't know whether I will be able to join ship or come back to\nIndia which is ban till 14th April. How long will I pay hotel bills. I have to\npay loan EMi and feed family. Company has not supported in this crisis as my\ncontract is valid from day I  join the ship. Tunisia is ban till 4th April and\nmay delay further. I don't understand how long will seafarer will stay without\nsalary and support families if no income.\"\n\n\u2022 \"It's not much fun being on a ship right now. There's a serious lack of, one\nmight say 'essence' among the crew. Lot of frightened people. Lot of people\nvery worried about family, most of the offices are closed so logistic comes\nare a clusterfuck. This is a chance for the DPAs to shine. But so far nothing.\nI'd say 70% of the world's fleet is approaching skeleton crew. Sure, it's a\nglobal nightmare but it's not what a lot of these signed for. Lots of folk\nexpected their companies to look after them. Seems the demands on the fleet is\ngetting greater with less logistic support less crew on board and less\naggressive support. Having said that I can't gripe my gang are all OK. Home\nand aboard, we've got some good banter going. Those guys in the article though\nthat's happened a lot and still happening. Really shitty.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Internet connections shipboard. There's usually a system for crew to have\naccess to a messaging service through Wi-Fi evergreen use Whats app I think we\nuse messenger or Viber I'm not sure. You are given or buy a data allowance.\nAnd can message whenever you like providing connection is good.  If that\nconnection goes down the crew have little or no contact with family at home\nbecause if you read the WHO special requirements for ports it's becoming more\nand more difficult to get local SIM cards.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Sign off cancelled as travel restrictions imposed. Now crew change is\nimpossible as no government will lift travel restrictions due to impact of\ncoronavirus.\"\n\n\u2022 \"This is really bad by the companies\u2026we have not signed contract for this\u2026we\nshould have the say.\"\n\n\u2022 \"I have a 3 months contract now I am already over 4 months on board, with\nmost of the counties shutting down borders it looks [like we] Would be on\nboard for a few months at least and even if can get off from the vessel might\nget stuck in some airport. Though the flights are shut but the ships are still\ngoing to corona infected areas like Spain and Italy, with insufficient\ndisinfectants sanitisers and medical equipment.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Only fear is in case someone gets corona on board it's a closed environment\nwould get transmitted to all on board. And in such a case for sure no country\nwill allow the vessel in its ports. For now we are just checking daily\ntemperature of all crew and people coming on board.\"\n\n\u2022 \"As of now there is no communication from the office regarding my salary not\nbeing paid. What do we do?\"\n\n\u2022 \"Because of heavy [expensive] port charges they won't take us to [an] Indian\nport. But we are very worried about family because they need us bad.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Sir, is there any possibility on policy changes for seafarers to get back\nto their family? It is very concerning.\"\n\n\u2022 \"I had a new born baby after my joining here. I have to see him.\"\n\n**News Suppression?**\n\nLet us be in no doubt that this pandemic is deadly.\n\nIt is a threat to our way of living and our humanity. It will change the way\nwe think, the way we act and how we engage with those around us. The greatest\nirony being that a virus, which ranges in size from about 20 to 400 nanometres\nin diameter, is now starting to re-establish a new working order in our\nglobalized world.\n\nWe are rightly hearing the positive and often stoic narratives of those\nseafarers who are staying onboard, keeping calm and carrying on, maintaining\nglobal supply lines and remaining at sea for the global common good.

I feel quite settled here at the job. The coal\nplant owners are very nice, they pay me overtime for every extra hour I spend\nat the factory beyond my designated 18hrs. It is nice here, the roads are\nsmooth, we are supplying electricity to all the people of our country and as\nCSR, we have also opened a mask factory. And you know what? I got one for\nfree. I wear it regularly now, because of all the pollution in the air. I will\nsend you guys some too. They say, the bad air will reach you guys soon too.\nBut don't you worry, I will send our masks!\n\nBy the way, after news of my joining broke out, the factory has been receiving\nmore and more visitors. Many of the human children have never seen a dolphin\nbefore! Can you imagine, ma?\n\nAnyway, I wait for you guys to write back soon. The factory guys will probably\nplan a visit to your area soon, might even take me along. I am quite the\nattraction, you know!\n\nIf that happens, I will try and visit.\n\nWith love,  \n  \nBaby Dolphin.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo,\n\nBaby Dolphin,  \n  \nMain Aquarium,  \n  \nBampal Powerplant.\n\nDear,  \n  \nWe miss you everyday here. The group is getting smaller and smaller but we are\nnot starved for entertainment. Just last Friday, a huge launch came really\ndeep inside the forest. They were playing music, some new indie folk stuff --\nyour younger brother Brodude mentioned. Brodude is planning to go to either\nBihar or Nijhum Dwip. He says there are marine protected areas there and\nscientific research on dolphins is going on where he wants to take part. Let's\nsee, we are still discussing the matter.\n\nBy the way, you do not have to send masks. The kids from the launch were kind\nenough to give us a few before they left.\n\nWaves and loves,\n\nDolphin ma\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Ma Dolphin and Baba dolphin,  \n  \nI am getting a little worried. Sent you all at least five letters and I have\nreceived no reply yet. Meanwhile, you know I keep getting bad news. It seems\nthese days, dolphin murders are on the rise. Just last week, the powerplant\naquarium was abuzz with news of two dolphins who washed ashore after they were\ncaught in fishing nets. Will you guys send out news and check how our\nrelatives are doing there? I worry. Please write back soon.\n\nLoves,\n\nBaby Dolphin.\n\n### Stay updated on the go with [The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net)\nAndroid & iOS [News App](https://www.thedailystar.net/apps-\nupgrade/index.html).

been in a love-hate relationship for a long time. I\u2019ve tried to take a\nstep back, but it\u2019s been tough. I\u2019m aware of how much it\u2019s affected how I've\nbehaved around other people in the past, how I\u2019ve been distracted and removed\nfrom conversations with my friends. It\u2019s caused me to dislike myself and feel\ndetached. Now though, everything's changed. What once made me feel\ndisconnected has given me connections I didn\u2019t even know I was missing. I'm\npart of a community supporting one another through a time of crisis. I've\nfallen in love with social media again.\n\n> I\u2019ve worked in television for 10 years, most recently as the host of dating\n> show _Love Island,_ so as a relatively public figure, I\u2019ve experienced highs\n> but also the particularly vicious side of how some humans behave within the\n> confines of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve been subject to a pretty intense volume of negativity. I\nlearned to grow a thick skin, but after a while it grated. People discuss my\nweight\u2014I\u2019m too thin, I\u2019m too fat\u2014they don\u2019t like my Irish accent. They say\nI\u2019ve had too much \u201cwork\u201d done. That my \u201cnose job\u201d is bad.\n\nInside I\u2019d be screaming, \u201cThis is how look. I was born like this. Fuck off.\u201d\nOf course, I'd never respond like that online (my mother follows me!), but my\nlove affair with social media, which had begun with no pressure, was suddenly\ncausing daily anxiety. When should I post? What will people say? Anything you\ndon\u2019t like about yourself is magnified a thousand times.\n\n> As in any relationship, we had good days and bad days. The good days on my\n> phone were great: Putting up an Instagram photo of myself on set, or after a\n> big interview, or about a new shiny job I landed gave my ego a boost, the\n> \"Likes\" rolling in, the pings not unlike a winning Vegas slot machine. But\n> the bad days were shit. (See nose job comments, above.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a long time I did nothing. It wasn\u2019t like I was alone. I\u2019d watch hundreds\nof other people in the public eye get torn apart and think, Well, everyone\ngets it, so it\u2019s just normal and it must be OK. But it\u2019s not OK.\n\nWhen British television presenter Caroline Flack took her own life in February\nthis year, I remember thinking about what she had to put up with. All the\ncomments I had seen online and savage headlines sprawled across the newspaper,\nday in, day out. Caroline always seemed like nothing had bothered her. She was\nfeisty and strong-willed. I'd been jealous that she was able to not let it all\nget to her, whereas I knew, in a similar situation, I would have crumbled.\nWhatever happened in her personal life or bad decisions she may have made, she\ndidn\u2019t deserve the attention she had to deal with daily. It was not the\nbusiness or duty of the keyboard warriors to publicly shame her.\n\nWhen I was asked to host _Love Island,_ although I _love_ the show, a part of\nme questioned whether I wanted to put myself in such a position that would\ninvite public scrutiny. I wanted to get away from the whole \u201cblond girl gets\ndressed up on the telly\u201d identity that had been attached to me. But I\u2019m good\nat my job, and I love live TV. So I made my decision based on my own opinion,\nrather than worry or anticipate the thoughts of the social media army.\n\nAnd to protect my own mental health, I removed anything personal from Twitter\nand Instagram and used them solely as a space to publicize my work. I was\nangry and fed up with this culture I had seen manifest itself around me and\nbecome acceptable\u2014the new normal. It felt good to take back control over\nsomething that had been controlling me.\n\nThen something none of us expected happened. The outside world was taken away\nfrom us. The eating out at restaurants, the bread rolls, all on lockdown.\nSuddenly self-isolating in our homes was not the wild plot of some B-movie but\nour daily life. The only way we can now communicate is by using our\nsmartphones. The outside world _is_ social media. _Fuck_.\n\n> But as our real world got scarier, the internet got, well, a little bit\n> nicer. I\u2019ve seen some shaming on Twitter for people who have been going out\n> even in the lockdown. But in the large part, this space we have created\n> feels safe, feels inclusive. We are checking in and we are talking _to_ each\n> other. I feel part of a community that brings us together, not divides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI live in London, and my mother lives in my hometown of Bray, outside Dublin.\nI\u2019ve been trying to get her to join FaceTime for years, and this week she\nfinally did. Our first attempt was a conversation with her perfectly groomed\neyebrows (thankfully, done just in time for lockdown), but now I see her\nsmiley face every day, just for a check-in before she does the gardening or I\nbinge the next box set.\n\nSince I\u2019ve lived in London, I\u2019ve never even really laid eyes on my neighbors,\nlet alone known their names. But now our neighborhood \u201cNextdoor\u201d app chat is\nthriving, and we\u2019re helping one another. I\u2019ve joined every platform out there\nto stay connected with people: Zoom, Houseparty, TikTok. I am on them all.\n\nI\u2019ve fallen in love with online all over again, and it feels so good. We\u2019ve\nboth grown up. Although my joining TikTok reminds me of when my mother got\nInstagram. I\u2019m a millennial trying to be part of Gen Z, and I don\u2019t care! It\u2019s\nsilly, it\u2019s fun, and it makes me laugh.\n\n![how to share your story with\nGlamour](https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e7cfc5fa929010008a7cd6d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/embdedd.jpg)\n\nWe want you to share YOUR love and relationship stories from COVID-19 with us.\nHere's how...\n\nLast weekend I got tipsy on the Houseparty app from the comfort of my kitchen\u2026\npopping into different \u201crooms\u201d and spending time with friends I hadn\u2019t spoken\nto in years and living in all corners of the world. We had a sing-along, we\ntalked about real-life issues, and we played virtual board games. I\u2019ve been\nphysically in contact only with my boyfriend, but I\u2019ve talked to more people\nthan ever. I am more alone than ever, but I don\u2019t feel lonely, as there is a\nwhole community out there that I\u2019m part of. That I _want_ to be part of.\n\nLife works in mysterious ways. The one thing that made me feel disconnected\nfor so long has connected me more than I ever knew it could. I really hope out\nof this dark time we\u2019ll see a real catalyst for permanent change, to be nicer\nto each other. I would, still, however like to wake up and see my boyfriend\u2019s\nface in front of me instead of his phone. And if we can be nicer to each other\nonline, anything can happen.\n\n _If you want to share YOUR COVID-19 relationship story with us, write to us\nor record a voice memo and email it to love@glamour.com.

I felt I can\u2019t do justice to the role in Mani sir\u2019s\nPonniyin Selvan. I felt it\u2019s better to not do a role that doesn\u2019t suit me and\nface unnecessary criticism later. I hope that I\u2019ll get another opportunity to\nact in Mani sir\u2019s film in the future\u201d. The reports suggest that Karthi plays\nVallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan and Ravi portrays the character of Arulmozhi Varman\nin this venture. Talking about the film, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan earlier told\nus, \"I\u2019ve just read the very detailed script and I\u2019m curious too because when\nyou read it, it\u2019s a movie in your head. Now, I want to discover what\u2019s the\nmovie in his head. At this point, we are discussing it. My joining the team\nwill be in the end of December or January. So, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\"\nAlso Read - [Week That was South: Master song Polakatum Para Para out, Amala\nPaul rejects Mani Ratnam's Ponniyin\nSelvan](https://www.bollywoodlife.com/south-gossip/week-that-was-south-master-\nsong-polakatum-para-para-out-amala-paul-rejects-mani-ratnams-ponniyin-\nselvan-1598997/)\n\nReportedly, [Aishwarya Rai\nBachchan](https://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/aishwarya-rai-bachchan/) will\nportray Nandini\u2014wife of Chola Kingdom's Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini's\nmother\u2014Mandakini Devi's part, who was a mute queen.

Debbarma, who was elected the MLA from Ramchandraghat\nassembly constituency in 2008, has not won an election since.\n\nSpeaking to the media on the merger, he said, \u201cI was a part of INPT and have\nreturned to it but this is not about my joining. NCT is joining rank and file\nin INPT and the combined party will henceforth be known as INPT (United)\u201d.\n\nDebbarma reasoned that in spite of floating his party 13 years ago, he held\nscattered movements for long and suffered severe setbacks in dissipated\nagitations. \u201cWe held scattered movements for long. The result is that we are\nabout to be finished. We have learnt that united we stand, divided we fall.\nSince charity begins at home, I have started by joining INPT. I believe others\nwill join a similar initiative soon,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen questioned about his reason for his departure from the party followed by\nhis return, he said, \u201cI went away from INPT due to some problems. I don't want\nto dig them out and I don\u2019t think those problems will repeat because most of\nthem (referring to those who had problems with him) are not here.\u201d\n\nINPT supremo and former rebel Bijoy Hrangkhawl said he was hopeful the merger\nwould be advantageous to achieve tribal rights. \u201cIt is a new political\nhistory. I believe the merger will have a positive influence, especially in\nhilly terrains and indigenous villages. We have an ongoing plan and programme\nto bring different regional indigenous parties together. They are thinking\nabout a common platform as well,\u201d Hrangkhawl said.\n\nOn March 2, two other tribal parties \u2014 Tipraland State Party (TSP) and\nIndigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT)\u2019s Tipraha faction \u2014 teamed up in an\nalliance and said they share similar priorities on opposing the [Citizenship\n(Amendment) Act](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-how-to-\nbe-a-citizen-of-india-earlier-now-6165960/) (CAA) and the introduction of the\n[National Register of Citizens](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/)\n([NRC](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/)). The joint forum said they would\ncontest the Tripura tribal council elections together.\n\nWhile the election schedule for TTAADC polls have not been announced, the\nincumbent council is scheduled to expire its term in May. The elections are\nlikely to be held in April or May.\n\n**\ud83d\udce3 _The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

of\ncorona](https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2020/03/24/956837-coronaa.jpg)\nHighlights\n\n## One upshot of the Covid\u201319 scare has been the self-imposed exile it has\ncaused, particularly in the elderly to which category this columnist most...\n\nOne upshot of the Covid\u201319 scare has been the self-imposed exile it has\ncaused, particularly in the elderly to which category this columnist most\ndecidedly belongs to.\n\nWhile being moderately inactive has been the natural state of things over the\npast decade or so after superannuation, the extent of immobility demanded by\nthe present situation is somewhat difficult cope up with.\n\nAs Ghalib once said, \"Subah Hoti Hai Sham Hoti hai Umar yun hi tamaam hoti\nhai\". Morning comes, then evening. All life is like that. Ennui, in other\nwords.\n\nIn such circumstances, it is natural for the mind to cast its roving eye over\nevents of bygone days and to recollect them. From among the most eligible\ncandidates of those memories, this columnist has chosen a few that offer the\nmost promising fare by way of entertainment in these difficult times.\n\nAs my training days were drawing to a close, and my posting as a Sub-Collector\nwas round the corner, my mother persuaded me to consult an astrologer about\nthe possible place of my posting. The production put out was that I would be\nposted to a place on the banks of a major river.\n\nNaturally, I started dreaming about the nice bungalow in which I had seen the\nSub-Collector live in Rajahmundry; and the pretty house that was the Sub-\nCollector's residence in Vijayawada. And when the news actually came, it was\nto Ongole that I was posted. It was only after some enquiry that I learnt that\nthere was, after all, a river close by, namely the Gundlakamma!\n\nThe late B R K Sastry was easily one of the sharpest, quickest and most\nefficient civil servants I came across in my career. It was his habit to leave\nthe office on the dot, at the closing hour. One day, to annoy him, a\nsubordinate sent a thick and complicated file just as he was about to leave.\nSastry gave it a long look.\n\nThe file contained many flags to facilitate reference to the documents it\ncontained. He pulled out a flag marked 'K', threw it away, wrote in the file\n\"where is flag K\"? Sent the file back and left for the day!\n\nAfter completion of my training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of\nAdministration in Mussoorie, I was posted to Krishna district in Andhra\nPradesh as an Assistant Collector under training.\n\nOne of the initial tasks entrusted to me was the preparation of the Village\nEconomic Report of the village to which I was posted for training as a village\nofficer.\n\nThe village was Pamarru which was also the village in which my predecessor R V\nV Vaidyanatha Iyer had also been trained. Though sorely tempted to plagiarise\nhis brilliant report, I resolved to do an original job and, in the event, put\nout a passable effort.\n\nThe highlight of the one month stay in Pamarru was the companionship I\ndeveloped with the 'karanam' of the village Sanjeeva Rao, who had only passed\nthe intermediate examination, but could have given today's professors of\nEnglish a run for their money.\n\nPamarru village lay on the highway connecting Machilipatnam to Vijayawada. My\nwife Usha had also joined me for my one month's stay. A bit of a climb down,\nas a matter of fact, compared to Switzerland where we had originally hoped to\nspend our honeymoon!\n\nIn November 1969 a serious cyclonic storm hit the coast of Andhra Pradesh\nState. Krishna district was one of the worst sufferers. Severe gales and heavy\nrains came with the cyclone. When we woke up one morning, we found that our\nbed was floating on water!\n\nHaving cautiously waded our way out of the room, we found that the guest house\nwas slightly below the level of the canal across the road and was totally\nsubmerged. The canal had breached its bund overnight and overflowed across the\nroad. My car, which was parked on the verandah of the guest house, was\nliterally floating on water up to its hood.\n\nWe somehow managed to get into the car and drive through the sheet of water\nall around us. In fact, as I turned into the road from the gate of the guest\nhouse, all I could see ahead of me was just water and was impossible to tell\nwhere the road margin ended, and the canal bund began. With a sigh of relief,\nwe drove back to Machilipatnam.\n\nThe adventure should have ended there under normal circumstances. But not for\nyours faithfully! Diwali was round the corner and Ramachandrapuram, where my\nin-laws stayed, was just a few hours' drive away.\n\nSo, the inclement weather notwithstanding, my sister-in-law, the ever-faithful\nRavi, our helper Usha and I set off to Ramachandrapuram. No sooner had we\ntravelled a few miles away from Machilipatnam than we found that the cyclone\nhad, indeed, wrought a great deal of havoc.\n\nUprooted trees lay across the roads, electric poles were twisted into weird\nshapes by the fierce winds and the roads had breached in several places. One\nmore reason why we ought to have turned back promptly and return to\nMachilipatnam.\n\nPartly sheer foolhardiness, partly the lure of the in-laws place, or simply\nthe reluctance to beat a retreat, we pressed on. Very soon we reached a place\nwhere river called now Naguleru crossed the road.\n\nThe bridge across the river was completely submerged and one had only the\nribbon of the road to indicate where the sides of the bridge were. Once again,\nignoring the peril of the swelling and swift waters, I persuaded the fragile\nStandard Herald car, with the glasses rolled up, to brave it across the\ninvisible bridge.\n\nFinally, and with a little assistance from extremely helpful local villagers,\nwe made it to the other side. That all of us had a great time celebrating\nDiwali at the other end was the compensation for all the excitement and\nfright.\n\nI have chronicled elsewhere that the primary reason for my joining the civil\nservices was my father's keenness upon my taking up that profession. After I\nhad concluded giving the interview at the UPSC, he flew to Delhi the next day,\nanxious to ascertain how I had fared.\n\nA full debriefing followed, at the end of which he exclaimed, \"How was I to\nknow that there was so much you did not know!\" A realisation more or less on\nthe lines on which my brother had earlier assessed me, when he stated that all\nmy knowledge could have been written in bold letters behind a postage stamp!\nOr, for that matter, my ignorance in small letters all the way from Hyderabad\nto New Delhi!\n\n_(The writer is former Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh)_\n\nShow Full Article[Email Article](javascript: void\\(0\\); \"Share by\nEmail\")[Print Article](javascript: void\\(0\\); \"Share by Email\")More On\n\n  * [COVID 19 ](https://www.thehansindia.com/tags/COVID-19)\n  * [Coronavirus ](https://www.thehansindia.com/tags/Coronavirus)\n\nDownload The Hans India [Android\nApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readwhere.whitelabel.hansindia&h1=en)\nor [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hans-india/id982905791?mt=8) for\nthe Latest update on your phone.

I was thinking this week about the different stages of FX growth.\nI remembered back to when I first entered the world of FX and I wanted to give\na brief outline of the different stages of a trader drawing on my own\nexperience. Very few people talk about their development as a trader, and yet\neveryone has to learn.Starting from the 'birth' of a trader through to\n'adulthood' and beyond this two part series will elaborate the five stages of\ngrowth I have identified for an aspiring FX trader. Let's start with the birth\nstage. It's rarely pretty...\n\n**Birth : The horrible world of the rookie**\n\n![Every market is a stage and it exposes every\nplayer](//az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20191214/alex-hockett-\ngip2h_skh7e-unsplash.jpg)\n\nBeing an FX rookie anywhere is hard. Being a retail FX rookie is nearly\nimpossible. Certainly breaking through the stage is. Approximately 90% of\nretail FX traders give up. You enter the world of FX keen and enthused. You\nmay have seen a video, demoed a MT4 platform or known a friend who 'made a lot\ntrading' and you decide to take the plunge. You can do this, you say. For me,\nback around 2002-03, I was working for a charity for the time and my wages\nwere very low. In fact at the charity we worked at we were grateful that we\nreceived any wages. Prior to my joining, a salary was not a standard thing\neach month. Hard to believe, perhaps, but true! Well, one day our charity had\na conferences and one of the conference speakers was a pensions adviser. I had\na wife and thought 'ok, I had better sort out a pension'. So, off I went to\nthe advisor's seminar.\n\n  \n\nHowever there was a problem! The advisor was recommending that I saved what to\nme was a ridiculously high amount of money. So, being a creative thinker, I\nthought there must be a way of doing this more efficiently. Then it occurred\nto me. So, I said to the advisor, 'If I save my money in GBP's but exchange it\ninto USD's when the exchange rate is in my favour and then do the opposite\nwhen the exchange rate changes again, I can make my pot grow faster'. It was\nwhat the pensions adviser said to me next that led me to FX. He just said,\n'then you will be doing what I am doing'.\n\n  \n\nYou quickly realise when you are learning FX that you have a lot to learn. FX\nrobots, Technicals or Fundamentals, google is awash with trading gurus ! There\nare so many ways to go wrong. That is not to mention the internet forums. They\nare full of people who are frankly quite odd. You would have some so called\n'expert' hammering a guy for being an 'idiot' and a 'trading loser'. Then huge\nego-driven arguments. Not an easy learning environment. So, if you are there\nright now at this place, what should you do?\n\n  \n\n**What to do as a rookie**\n\nFocus on learning the basics. Check out a good site like\n[babypips.com](http://babypips.com). Work through it. Trading takes time. The\njargon, the concepts. You don't need to know it all, of course, but put time\nin to learn. Don't get a FX mentor at this stage, spend time learning the\nbasics on your own.\n\n  \n\nRealise that you need to use fundamentals to decide your instrument to trade\nand then technicals to time your entry and exits. Work on understanding what\nthat last sentence means.\n\n  \n\n**Toddler: Finding your feet**\n\n  \n\n![How to trade FX](//az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20191214/jelleke-\nvanooteghem-8sophl6tmlm-unsplash.jpg)  \n\nYou are now trading and getting mixed results. You have worked out that some\nnews events have a big impact on price and you are ready for it. You know\nabout key support and resistance levels and you can see that some places are\ntechnically great for entries. You may have backtested a system or a dozen and\nyou are confident and ready.You are not a beginner anymore, but you have gaps\nin your knowledge. You may not understand the role of the bond and equity\nmarket in FX and options and central bank language is still a but of a\nmystery. You know what a 'spike in cable' means, but you don't understand what\nis moving the currency pairs.\n\n  \n\nWhen I was learning to trade at this stage I discovered the beauty of a 'sell\non stop' in combination with a market maker broker. It was a beautiful time.\nThe market maker brokers I was with got caught with their trousers down when\nI'd sell on stop out of a big market event. Because the market maker has an\nartificial market the fills I got tended to be quite good (this will depend on\ndifferent brokers obviously). They honouedr the trade on the hope that next\ntime I would mess it up, over leverage and hand all my money over to them.\nHowever, what bugged me during this time was yes, I was making money, but I\ndidn't know why or which direction the market was going in. I had constant\ninsecurity in my mind. It was horrible as I only understood the technicals of\ntrading. This stage ended for me when I got an e-mail closing my account I\nonly worked out many months later why they had shut my account because I was\nexposing their market making model.This made me assess where I was at and\ndecide that I wanted to not just trade the markets, but have an understanding\nof them. If you are here, wanting to understand the markets and why it moves\nthen here is what you need to do:\n\n  \n\n**What to do**\n\nGet a mentor. Pay for training from a professional. _You will save years of\nfrustration_. I mean imagine trying to learn any skill without guidance.Yes,\nyou can do it, but it doesn't mean you should do it. Only the most persistent\nand able will persevere through the incredible frustration in self teaching a\nprofession\n\n  \n\n**What to avoid**\n\n![What to do](//az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20191214/nicolas-cool-cd2qniku6dk-\nunsplash.jpg)  \n\nDo not use high leverage at this stage. There is a phase that gets bandied\naround that '90% of new traders lose 90% of their capital in the first 90\ndays'. I personally recommend that during this stage you do two things:\n\n  1. Don't use leverage. If you have invested 1000 units of currency only trade 0.01 micro lot. This is trading without leverage. If you leverage up, lose your account then you will create mental barriers to your success further down the line. Trust me and follow this advice.\n  2. If and when you lose 10% of your account, stop trading, Something is wrong and you need to re-evaluate. Demo trade until profitable and then get back on the bike.\n\n  \n\nBy following this advice you will almost certainly learn to trade before\nblowing out your account. You will also avoid losing a painful amount of money\nthat you most probably need. Oh, and by the way, learn to trade with as little\nmoney as possible. You may very well lose it at first, so whatever you do\ndon't invest a lot. Finally, if you do lose a lot. Don't worry. You can\nrebuild and re-start. Just don't do it twice.\n\nThe next article will be on the 'Adolescent and Adult 'stage of trading. I\nhope that this has helped some people out there and please share it around to\nanyone you think might benefit from it. Remember trading takes a long time to\nlearn, despite what you may have been told. However, most of the ability to\nsucceed just comes from not quitting, so it is a skill that you can master.\n\n[ForexLive](https://www.forexlive.com)\n\n![](/Content/Newsletter/newsletter-icon.svg)\n\nGet the Forexlive newsletter\n\nSelect additional content\n\nEducation\n\nTrading offers from relevant providers\n\nBy subscribing I agree to Finance Magnates' [Terms, Cookies and Privacy\nNotice](https://www.financemagnates.com/terms-of-use/) This field is required\n\nSIGN UP\n\n![](/Content/Newsletter/success-message-icon.svg)\n\nSubscription Confirmed!\n\nThank you for subscribing\n\n##  Trade with Top Brokers\n\n##  [Must Read](/)\n\n  * ####  [Global crisis: Now and before](https://www.forexlive.com/!/global-crisis-now-and-before-20200330)\n\n  * ####  [Why OPEC+ will cut even without US participation](https://www.forexlive.com/!/why-opec-might-cut-even-without-us-participation-20200406)\n\n  * ####  [Oil: Free for all](https://www.forexlive.com/!/oil-free-for-all-20200331)\n\n[Market Data](https://www.tradingview.com) by TradingView\n\n##  [Technical Analysis](/technical-analysis \"Open the Forex Technical\nAnalysis Hub for more articles like this\")\n\n  * ####  [USD/JPY continues its identity struggle so far this week](https://www.forexlive.com/!/usdjpy-continues-its-identity-struggle-so-far-this-week-20200408)\n\n  * ####  [AUD/USD keeps lower as dollar continues to hold firm so far on the session](https://www.forexlive.com/!/audusd-keeps-lower-as-dollar-continues-to-hold-firm-so-far-on-the-session-20200408)\n\n  * ####  [Euro, risk stumbles as EU finance ministers fail to agree on coordinated virus response](https://www.forexlive.com/!/euro-risk-stumbles-as-eu-finance-ministers-fail-to-agree-on-coordinated-response-20200408)\n\n  * ####  [The NASDAQ index is the 1st to go negative](https://www.forexlive.com/!/the-nasdaq-index-is-the-1st-to-go-negative-20200407)\n\n  * ####  [New lows for the USDCHF.

An ex-boss of mine at The\nTimes of India Group, Reddy had gone on to co-found seed fund Blume Ventures,\nwhich had evolved into a much-loved and well-regarded player in the Indian\nstartup ecosystem. These messages were markedly different from our usual\ndiscussions; they were about him thinking aloud about a potential role for me\nat Blume, and would in turn spur a meeting between us, leading to my joining\nthe firm a year later.\n\nThis is a part narrative of my journey and experience, and partly a reflection\non the Indian venture capital (VC) industry. I wanted to give readers a sense\nof what it is that I see from my vantage point in Blume\u2019s investment team.\n\n## It\u2019s not just about investing\n\nMy initial conversations with Blume, especially as 2018 got underway, took\nplace against the backdrop of the company\u2019s partners working to raise its\nthird series fund. This was to be its largest fund at $80 million (Rs573\ncrore) and they were trying to onboard a bunch of newer and larger limited\npartners (LPs), the folks who give us money to invest.\n\nI was involved with a few of those LP conversations, where I was introduced to\nthem as a prospective hire. I don\u2019t think I was as worried about meeting the\nBlume partners as I was about the LP meetings given any carry over of a poor\nperformance from me to their Blume discussions.\n\nIndustry commentators and aspirants portraying the VC\u2019s role as a cushy \u201cbuy-\nside\u201d one\u2014listening to pitches, dispensing cash to select founders, and\nrejecting others\u2014please note that before VCs can distribute cash, there is a\nlot of selling to be done to LPs to raise those funds.\n\nBefore VCs can distribute cash, there is a lot of selling to be done to LPs.\n\nWhen founders complain about fundraising, we empathise, for we know how\nstressful it is and also understand its implications. If we can\u2019t raise the\nnext fund, then we can\u2019t fund startups and are locked out of the ecosystem.\nGiven that 2% of the fund size counts towards fees, from which salaries and\nexpenses are met, inability to raise funds can also cripple a firm\nfinancially.\n\nIn Blume\u2019s case, just as with all homegrown venture funds such as India\nQuotient, Pi Ventures, and Stellaris, the partners who invest are the ones\nhustling to raise cash as well. This is unlike some of the larger MNC funds in\nIndia who typically get a carve-out of the money raised, with a partner who\nfocuses on fundraising sitting at the headquarters. Given that Blume is\nfundraising while also investing simultaneously\u2014the founders don\u2019t know about\nyour fundraising cycles or don\u2019t care\u2014and also has an existing portfolio to\nworry about, this means a lot more emails, hustle, and travel.\n\nThe partners bear the brunt of all this, but it spills over to the rest of the\nteam as well. Accentuating this is the huge volume of inbound early stage\ninvestment opportunities (including idea stage pitches), a holdover from our\nmicro-VC days, which calls for a fair share of the organisation\u2019s time. Let us\nunderstand this in detail.\n\nWe typically get around 3,500 pitches a year. Up to a sixth of those are\nreferrals. The cold pitches get anywhere from a minute to five minutes (very\nrarely, a bit more) while the referrals get at least 15-20 minutes and a mail\nback. Often the referrals lead to a meeting. Sometimes two.\n\nThen there are calls from journalists, hiring interviews (everyone wants to\nexplore a role in the industry; often the introductions come from senior\nfolks/LPs, which mean at least a 30-minute call) and often mentoring\ndiscussions that don\u2019t have a pipeline or portfolio outcome. Add to this,\nportfolio catchups, and you can quickly lose control of your schedule. A day\nspent in meetings is at least 60-70 mails piled up. I don\u2019t think I have\nworked under 60 hours in any week since I joined Blume.\n\nThis tweet on the VC business by Leo Polovets, a VC with Susa Ventures, was\nparticularly interesting (the second observation I thought was on point):\n\n## Battling ageism\n\nAmongst the most dramatic differences between VC and traditional industries is\nthe time you spend with 20-somethings.\n\nI can go days without meeting anyone in their 40s. Yes, we do get pitches from\nolder founders, but the vast majority of startup founders are in their late\n20s or early 30s. This is especially true of business-to-customer startups.\n\nIt has been hugely energising to meet these fearless young founders, out to\nchange the world. You can feed off their excitement, energy, and passion.\n\nEven so, I wonder if we celebrate youth a bit too much. It isn\u2019t the\ncelebration of youth that is worrying as is the creeping subtle discrimination\nagainst older founders, especially those in their 40s.\n\nI, in my 40s, may discriminate against someone in my age group.\n\nFaced with a pitch from an older founder, I sometimes had to check myself to\nnot judge it unfavourably. There is a real reason for this, especially if the\nfounder has had a successful corporate career before starting up. The\nassumption being the person has enough money and taste for creature comforts\nto not struggle for too long.\n\nIt is actually bizarre that I, in my 40s, can end up discriminating against\nsomeone in my age group.\n\nTrue [ageism, as seen in the\nValley](http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2019/aug/24/silicon-valley-\ntechies-as-afraid-of-ageing-as-bikini-models-2023584.html), isn\u2019t here in\nIndia yet, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised when it arrives soon.\n\n## Role reversal\n\nI spoke earlier about how VCs sell to LPs in the context of Blume and other\nhomegrown funds. However, it is not just LPs to whom VCs have to sell. We also\nsell to founders. A hot space with hot founders can see VCs lining up to pitch\nto them, instead of the other way.\n\nThis is especially true of successful founders starting out a second time.\nThere aren\u2019t too many of these, and when you hear of a founder planning to\nstartup again, there can be a VC rush resembling a feeding frenzy.\n\nRecently, I heard that a successful Indian fintech founder was approached by\nthree different VCs on the day the news of his exit from his present company\nleaked.\n\nEffectively the demand-supply gap in favour of VCs (versus founders), inverts\nin favour of founders as we reach the top of the founder pyramid. There simply\nare more VCs chasing high quality founders than the other way around. In this\ncontext then, as Reddy mentioned in a podcast, \u201cthe trick of the trade is\nactually not about you saying \u2018I know how to pick well.\u2019 It is whether the\nbest entrepreneurs want to pick you.\u201d\n\nOnce you and the entrepreneurs pick each other, the relationship quickly\nchanges. Investing is only the beginning. It is all of the working together\nover the next few years, and supporting and adding value to the founder\u2019s life\nthrough mentoring, sparring on strategy, support on hiring and fundraising,\nthat really helps set the startup for growth and greatness. As this tweet puts\nit well, the VC business is as much \u201ccustomer service\u201d as finance, and that is\njust as good a lens to see this business through.\n\n## The shifting sands\n\nMy entry in to VC came at a time when the industry was going through two\ninteresting trends:\n\n  * easy access to capital and its impact on higher valuations, delayed IPOs\n  * entry of later-stage VCs into seed-stage investing such as the Surge programme\n\nThe first trend, manifested in easy access to capital, is due to greater LP\n(and international) interest in the Indian market. This is an outcome of not\njust the performance of the Indian market\u2014exits such as Flipkart and other\nupround-creating unicorns certainly\u2014but also its inevitability. After all,\nthere is no other large market that can grow anywhere close to the rates the\nChinese economy grew at.\n\nA fund manager for Tiger or Coatue sitting in New York or San Francisco, or\neven an LP, sees the world in terms of different IRRs (internal rates of\nreturn, the metric used to determine attractiveness of an investment). With\nthe recent success stories, the Indian market\u2019s IRR is attractive enough for\nLPs to participate. This manifests in greater allocation by LPs to Indian\nfunds, which means more money chasing founders and rising valuations.\n\nThe attractiveness is also seen in more direct investments by the likes of\nSteadview or Softbank in Indian companies, bumping up valuations and often\ndelaying imminent IPOs, in an attempt to extract as much of the value before\nthe startup goes public.\n\nA related explanation is the emergence of second-time founders in India over\nthe past couple of years, thanks to exits and the maturation of the Indian\nstartup ecosystem. VC funds find investing in these second-time founders a\nless \u201criskier\u201d opportunity given their track record.\n\nAccel recently launched Rebound, a programme targeting second-time founders.\nOther VC funds, too, have such schemes. The result of such competition has\nbeen valuation inflation for second-time founders, justifiably or not.\n\nThis is also a good segue into the second interesting trend underway:\n[Traditionally, later-stage investors doing seed\ninvestments](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/vcs-\nready-tools-to-plant-seeds-in-startup-ground/70866748).\n\nSurge is the strongest outward manifestation of this, but there is also\nLightspeed\u2019s Extreme Entrepreneurship Program, and other under-the-\nradar/opportunistic optionality plays from other funds.\n\nThe implications of these trends are waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe primary reason for this, in my view, is the availability of second-time\nfounder bets. The other is also the increasing availability of highly\npedigreed first-time founders or emergence of strong signaling mechanisms\n(super angels on cap table, YC selection etc.) as the Indian ecosystem\nmatures.\n\nThe implications of these trends, and what it means for the Indian VC market,\nare waiting to be discovered. For now, it is creating a vibrant, or as some\nsay frothy private market, standing out sharply from the lackluster public\n(stock) market. In fact, [this\ncontrast](https://miten.co/2019/08/17/indiacaptialcycleaug2019/) between\nprivate boom, reflected in supersized startup funding announcements, and\npublic gloom, manifesting in dropping auto and consumer goods sales, is\nparticular striking.\n\nThe mood in startup land is optimistic, but there is a sense that, if the\npublic market and the larger economy doesn\u2019t pick, we may be in for some mild\nturbulence soon.\n\nThe Indian startup ecosystem is a particularly exciting place to be, and I am\ngrateful for the vantage point I occupy in the investment team at Blume.\nThrough this piece I wanted to give the reader a sense of what it is I see and\nexperience. I hope it has been useful, and if you do wish to reach out and ask\nme questions, I would be happy to help.\n\n _We welcome your comments at[ideas.india@qz.com](mailto:ideas.india@qz.com)._\n\n[![Quartz Daily Brief](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/QZ-DB-\navatar-1.png?w=40&h=40&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75)](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n[\n\n##### Quartz Daily Brief\n\n](/emails/daily-brief/)\n\n##### Subscribe to the Daily Brief, our morning email with news and insights\nyou need to understand our changing world.\n\nSign me up\n\n[China](/re/china/), [\u202aIndia\u202c](/re/%e2%80%aaindia%e2%80%ac/),\n[Japan](/re/japan/), [new york](/re/new-york/), [bengaluru](/re/bengaluru/)\n\n[\ud83d\udcac\\+ Add your insights](/co/2681864/)\n\n[](mailto:?subject=Quartz%20India%3A%20A%20newly-\nminted%20Indian%20VC%20takes%20an%20honest%2C%20hard-\nnosed%20look%20at%20his%20industry&body=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1703692%2Fa-\nnewly-minted-indian-vc-takes-an-honest-look-at-his-\nindustry%2F%0A%0AThe%20mood%20in%20startup%20land%20is%20optimistic%2C%20but%20it%20may%20be%20in%20for%20turbulence%20soon.\n\"Share via\nemail\")[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1703692%2Fa-\nnewly-minted-indian-vc-takes-an-honest-look-at-his-\nindustry%2F&caption=qz.com%20%7C%20By%20Sajith%20Pai \"Share via\nfacebook\")[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Findia%2F1703692%2F&text=A%20newly-\nminted%20Indian%20VC%20takes%20an%20honest%2C%20hard-\nnosed%20look%20at%20his%20industry&via=qzindia \"Share via twitter\")\n\n[](/)\n\nNews for the next era, not the next hour\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\nDiscover\n\n  * [Membership](/become-a-member/)\n  * [Emails](/emails/)\n  * [Latest](/latest/)\n  * [Popular](/popular/)\n  * [Featured](/featured/)\n  * [Obsessions](/obsessions/)\n\nTopics\n\n  * [Emerging industries](/topic/emerging-industries/)\n  * [Economics](/topic/finance-and-economics/)\n  * [Lifestyle](/topic/lifestyle/)\n  * [Politics](/topic/politics-and-policy/)\n  * [Science](/topic/science-and-human-behavior/)\n  * [Tech](/topic/tech-and-communications/)\n  * [Work](/topic/work-and-management/)\n\nMore\n\n  * [Search](/search/)\n  * [Careers](/careers/)\n  * [About us](/about/)\n  * [Contact us](/about/#contact)\n  * [Help center](https://help.qz.com/en/)\n  * [Send us tips](/tips/)\n\n[Become a member](/become-a-member/)\n\n[Download our app](/app/?pid=socialshare&af_dp=zebroid%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ffooter)\n\n  * [Site map](/sitemap/)\n  * [Terms & conditions](/about/terms-conditions/)\n  * [Privacy policy](/about/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Do not sell my info](/about/do-not-sell/)\n  * [Ethics and advertising agreements](/about/ethicsandadvertisingguidelines/)\n  * [Community agreements](/about/community-agreements/)\n\nQuartz is owned by [Uzabase](https://www.uzabase.com/en/), the business\nintelligence and media company. \u00a9 2020 Quartz Media, Inc.

strategist as president\n\nBy [DANIEL STRAUSS](https://www.politico.com/staff/daniel-strauss)\n\n08/26/2019 08:01 AM EDT\n\n[****Share

the data and analytics firm that start out serving Republican\ncandidates and causes and has shifted in a bipartisan direction, is bringing\non a seasoned Democratic operative as its new president.\n\nJoe Shafer, who will run the firm's political and advocacy division, spent\nyears working as a top operative on Democratic gubernatorial races. He most\nrecently ran the Democratic Governors Association's independent expenditure\narm and managed Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's 2014 campaign as well as former\nWest Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's 2011 and 2012 campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApplecart was founded by Matt Kalmans and Sacha Samotin in 2013 and has grown\nto almost 50 people. In 2016, the firm helped a super PAC backing then-Ohio\nGov. John Kasich's presidential campaign.\n\nIn an interview, Shafer said that joining the campaign was consistent with the\nfirm's direction since then.\n\n\"It's been pragmatic and solutions oriented candidates. They're known for the\nKasich work but they're also worked with Conor Lamb's huge special election\nvictory,\" Shafer said. \"So I think that kind of pragmatic approach is\nsomething that's refreshing and needed quite frankly.\"\n\n\"The types of Republicans that Applecart has worked with are people that are\nvocal opponents of Trump and I think that coupled with my joining,\" Shafer\ncontinued. \"I think it sends a signal of the type of company and the type of\npeople we want to work with going forward.\"\n\n[****Share on\nFacebook](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/2zkdnmD&pubid=politico.com)\n[****Share on\nTwitter](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/2zkdnmD&pubid=politico.com&text=Kasich+2016+analytics+firm+hires+veteran+Democratic+strategist+as+president+)\n\n###### This article tagged under:\n\n  * [Data](https://www.politico.com/tag/data)\n  * [Data Analytics](https://www.politico.com/news/data-analytics)\n  * [Elections](https://www.politico.com/news/elections)\n  * [Republican](https://www.politico.com/news/republican)\n\nMissing out on the latest scoops?

and let them see the big picture when they're caught up in the day to day. \n  * [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet)\n\nI was recently having coffee with a mentor known for asking tough questions. A\nfew minutes into our meeting she asked, \"What are you struggling with in your\nbusiness right now? What's hard that you didn't expect?\"\n\nI didn't presume to have an immediate answer (there are so many hard things I\ngrapple with on a weekly basis), but I did. Without thinking, I said, \"I'm\nlonely. I spend a lot of time by myself, which often can be great, but I miss\nhaving colleagues.\" And it was true. Much of my creativity in the past had\ncome from collaboration with peers. I knew that I thrived in group\nbrainstorming sessions, and I couldn't remember the last time I had done that.\nSometimes being alone served to stifle new ideas for me, and my doubts about\nmy work tended to amplify.\n\nI was grateful for this mentor's question because it forced me to vocalize and\ncome to terms with a hard truth about my business: _I can 't do this alone._\nAnd, I've heard from many other entrepreneurs (particularly solopreneurs) that\nthey've experienced similar feelings of loneliness at one time or another.\n\nFor me, the solution to my problem was the equivalent of a business support\ngroup, also called a \"mastermind group.\"\n\nMy mastermind group is comprised of three individuals. And here's what I\nbelieve makes it so successful: _We 're all solopreneurs at similar stages of\nbusiness growth, but we each have very different businesses_. Christina Noel\nis the founder of [Noel & Co](https://noelandco.io), a marketing and strategy\nconsultancy. Emily Crookston is the founder of [The Pocket\nPhD](https://www.thepocketphd.com/), a ghostwriting agency. And I am the\nfounder of [The Authenticity Guide](http://www.theauthenticityguide.com), an\nexecutive and career coaching firm.\n\nWe have some overlapping business areas (like public speaking), but core\nrevenue sources are different for each of us. Christina and I had known each\nother through our work in the local social impact community, and Christina met\nEmily while they were both doing contract gigs for the same digital agency.\nThe three of us ran into each other at a WomenEmpowerX conference in Raleigh\nand bonded about the woes of solopreneurship. It was then that Christina\npitched the idea of a mastermind group for the three of us - our chemistry as\na group was undeniable - and we got to work.\n\nHere's how our mastermind works: We meet biweekly over the phone and once per\nquarter in person (meeting in person is easy since we all live within a 30\nmile radius). Each person gets a certain amount of time to speak and get\nfeedback from the others in the group. Not only is this an amazing way to get\nfree business advice from people you like and respect, but it's phenomenal for\naccountability as well. We do things like set 90-day vision plans, create\ngoals, talk about what's hard and seek advice, and - most importantly - we\nalso celebrate what's going well. Recently, the group helped me narrow down my\n2020 revenue target areas from 10 disparate ideas to three targeted\napproaches. I now have a clear, well thought-out direction for the year ahead.\n\n[Dorie Clark](https://dorieclark.com/), marketing strategist and professor at\n[ Duke University's Fuqua School of\nBusiness](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-into-duke-university-\nfuqua-school-of-business-mba-program), runs regular mastermind groups for\nsuccessful entrepreneurs in New York. According to Clark, \"It's easy for\nbusiness owners to fall into perpetual 'execution mode,' where they stay busy\nand work hard - but as circumstances change and their business evolves, they\nmay find themselves working hard on the wrong things. I've run mastermind\ngroups for successful entrepreneurs for the past three years, and I've seen\nthe incredible value of forcing yourself to take periodic short breaks from\nyour business to consider the bigger picture. It's very powerful to have a\nsupportive group of fellow professionals ask incisive questions that can spark\nnew ideas and ensure you're working on the initiatives that will really move\nthe needle.\"\n\nAnd mastermind groups are not just for entrepreneurs. They can be great\nsources of collaboration and inspiration for employees of larger firms,\nparticularly when groups are comprised of individuals across diverse, non-\ncompeting firms.\n\nYou can join a pre-existing mastermind group or pay a reputable facilitator to\nplace you in one. Facebook and LinkedIn can be useful places to start\nresearching which group to join, or ask the executive coaches you know if they\nfacilitate mastermind groups. But I prefer the a la carte approach to ensure\nit fits your business and personal needs.\n\nHere are some preliminary steps if you're thinking about starting your own\nmastermind:\n\n  * Think about individuals who you both like and respect and whose business _maturity_ mirrors yours, but whose business _offerings_ differ from yours. You can start by making a list of people you already know and whittling it down from there, or you can ask people you trust in your network for introductions to other entrepreneurs whose businesses are in a similar growth stage to yours. \n  * Schedule time to talk to those individuals to see if you connect with them - and if a mastermind group would be of interest. Ask them what their goals might be from such a group to see if you're aligned. \n  * Cap your mastermind group size at four to five individuals. Though larger groups can be effective, I advise keeping the group intimate so that each person gets ample time to share. \n  * Schedule a regular time to meet that works for everyone and get started! \n\nMy mastermind group has solved my loneliness and creativity problems and has\ncreated some much-needed accountability for me. Give it a try in the new year\nand see how it goes.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Business](/tag/business/)\n  * [contributor 2019](/tag/contributor-2019/)\n  * [Entrepreneurship](/tag/entrepreneurship/)\n  * [mastermind group](/tag/mastermind-group/)\n  * [original contributor](/tag/original-contributor/)\n  * [solo entrepreneur](/tag/solo-entrepreneur/)\n  * [support network](/tag/support-network/)\n\n[Julia Wuench, [Business Insider\nUS](http://www.businessinsider.com/?IR=T)](https://www.businessinsider.my/author/businessinsider)\n\n#### Popular Articles\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.my/sites/3/wordpress-popular-posts/3058769-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.my/how-long-can-coronavirus-live-on-surfaces-how-to-disinfect-2020-3 \"The coronavirus can live on a surgical mask for 7 days, cloth for 2 days, and paper for 3 hours.

Below she describes her IR journey so far\n\nI joined Century Pacific Food in 2014, while it was in the middle of executing\nan IPO. At that time, I had minimal work experience having just graduated from\nuniversity two years prior.\n\nOut of necessity, however, I was quickly thrust into a leadership role \u2013\noverseeing the deal process that was previously being handled by the CEO and\nCFO.\n\nSeveral sleepless nights later, Century Pacific successfully listed on the\nPhilippine Stock Exchange, putting the onus on me to now create an IR program\nfrom scratch.\n\nThis involved not only developing our communication strategies, but also\nlaying out the pipework that would get out financial and business information\nlike clockwork.\n\nTo do that, I had to first shape and explain my function internally, proving\nthat an IR officer could still create value even after the listing of the\ncompany.\n\nI worked up support internally, encouraging colleagues to embrace life being\npublicly listed with both excitement and openness.\n\nDue to my inexperience, I also consciously sought mentors among the IR, sell-\nside and buy-side communities, all of whom endured my endless questions and\nrequests for feedback.\n\nFinally, and probably most importantly, I worked to win the trust of our\nprincipal owners. Together, we made long-term thinking our guide. This meant\nbeing open and honest, not only about the business\u2019 opportunities, but its\nvarious challenges as well.\n\nIn this regard, I\u2019ve taken a view that, in an IR role, you can only be as good\nas the company\u2019s principals allow you to be. It is a job where you speak _for_\nthem __ and _on_ their behalf. Without their trust, no strategy or technique\nwill help you do the best possible job.\n\n**The circumstances of my joining Century Pacific were also a first taste of\nwhat I\u2019ve now coined \u2018end-to-end IR\u2019** \u2013 where the IR function is involved in\nall stages of both raising _and_ utilizing capital.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve officially expanded my role to include not only IR, but\ntreasury and corporate finance as well. While planning and directing investor\nrelations, I also analyze and execute various investment and M&A opportunities\nfor the group.\n\nForemost of these, since Century Pacific\u2019s IPO, was the acquisition of\nShakey's Pizza Asia Ventures in 2016.\n\nMonths after closing that deal, we listed Shakey's as well \u2013 a repeat for me\nin terms of the many efforts that went into setting up Century Pacific for its\nown listing a few years ago.\n\n**Today I find myself in a unique position, differentiated from the more\nconventional IR function** : I oversee the execution of capital raising\nactivities for both equity and debt, get involved in the investing and\nutilization of the funds, and work on maintaining our companies\u2019 credibility\nin the financial markets so we can easily access capital again in the future \u2013\na virtuous cycle of end-to-end IR.\n\nThis is an expansion of what the function means on paper. But in reality, IR\nis a function that should be the responsibility of everyone in the company.\nAll should feel the pressure of being listed as it is everyone\u2019s role to\ncreate shareholder value. IR is simply the public face for it.\n\n[Click here to find out more about the IR Magazine Awards \u2013 South East\nAsia.](https://events.irmagazine.com/southeastasia/)\n\nSign up to get stories direct to your inbox\n\nEmail:\n\nSign Up\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/share?text=End-to-end investor relations: The IR journey of rising star Giovanna Vera - &amp;url=https://www.irmagazine.com/small-cap/end-end-investor-relations-ir-journey-rising-star-giovanna-vera)\n  * [](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.irmagazine.com/small-cap/end-end-investor-relations-ir-journey-rising-star-giovanna-vera&title=End-to-end investor relations: The IR journey of rising star Giovanna Vera&source=End-to-end investor relations: The IR journey of rising star Giovanna Vera)\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.irmagazine.com/small-cap/end-end-investor-relations-ir-journey-rising-star-giovanna-vera)\n\n## Sponsored whitepaper\n\n  * [![What does it take to have a winning IR strategy?](https://d2gw7wlacudg7o.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/IRM002_OTC_White_paper_Nov2019_05_cover_0.jpg?itok=GR0US0cg)](/whitepapers/what-does-it-take-have-winning-ir-strategy)\n\nOTC Markets\n\n## [What does it take to have a winning IR strategy?](/whitepapers/what-does-\nit-take-have-winning-ir-strategy)\n\n[Download](/node/31464 )\n\nThe newest white paper from OTC Markets Group, reflects on the recent IR\nMagazine Awards \u2013 Small Cap.

It reads:\n\n\"There has been an accusation floating around that I want to address. In 2019,\nI partnered with @Dove for their project #GirlsRoom. Prior to my joining the\nproject, in 2017 a @Dove partner came up with the title and the concept from\nwhich my scripts were based. I was brought on to write the scripts and produce\nthe content. I have never seen Nina Lee's work nor would I ever steal another\nartist's work. As a fellow creator myself, I can only imagine how she must be\nfeeling and I look to #Dove to give us more clarity on the situation. Now that\nI'm aware of Nina Lee, I look forward to seeing her art.\"\n\n>\n> [#GirlsRoom](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GirlsRoom?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [pic.twitter.com/KYmOUH36Bc](https://t.co/KYmOUH36Bc)\n>\n> -- Lena Waithe (@LenaWaithe) [February 26,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe/status/1232687706930479109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n\n**Original story:**\n\nWriter, producer and actress [**Lena Waithe**](https://newsone.com/tag/lena-\nwaithe/) has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry with shows\nlike \"The Chi\", movies like \"Queen and Slim\" and an Emmy-winning episode of\n\"Master of None\". Despite the successes, the 35-year-old creator has also had\nher [fair share of controversies](https://newsone.com/playlist/lena-waithe-\nsorkin-queen-slim-comment/), and recently she's being accused of taking the\nidea of a lesser known filmmaker.\n\nOn Friday, the video platform ATTN: tweeted a trailer for a new show created\nby Waithe called \"Girls Room\". The show was announced back in May 2019 and\nit's described as an anthology-style series that \"will explore the pain and\npower of female adolescence as told through the eyes of an inter-connected\ngroup of girls,\" according to [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2019/05/lena-\nwaithe-attn-scripted-series-girls-room-dove-self-esteem-project-1202613655/).\n\nWaithe is listed as the writer and creator for the show, and she also serves\nas a producer via her Hillman Grad Productions alongside ATTN:. Dove's Self-\nEsteem Project for young women also serves as a partner. The show is apart of\na line of upcoming scripted series produced by ATTN:, which is mostly known\nfor its documentary-style short and mid-form content.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve admired Dove and its mission to educate young women through their Self-\nEsteem Project for a long time,\u201d said Waithe in a statement. \u201cCrafting a story\nthat\u2019s purposeful and relevant to our shared values was exciting to me on a\ndeeply personal level. I want girls to watch this show and feel like they\u2019re\nnot alone.\u201d\n\n> Get to know Melba, Minnie, Thelma, Gloria, and Carlotta in Girls Room, a new\n> show created by\n> [@LenaWaithe](https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about a\n> group of high school friends dealing with bullies, social media, body\n> insecurities, and so much more.\n> [pic.twitter.com/sbzjHVeIKi](https://t.co/sbzjHVeIKi)\n>\n> -- ATTN: (@attn) [February 21,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/attn/status/1230945535890092032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n\nWhen the trailer was posted on Friday, a Twitter user listed as screenwriter\n**Nina Lee**\n[tweeted](https://twitter.com/NinaSerafina/status/1231378728271392771), \"this\nlooks awful, yes I\u2019m hating,\" then went on to explain how she had a show\ncalled \"The Girls Room\" that's eerily similar to Waithe's project.\n\n\"This show was definitely a learning experience, thanks to everyone involved\nand to those who still believes in me,\" she wrote in a\n[tweet](https://twitter.com/NinaSerafina/status/1231391771978014720) along\nwith a poster of her version of \"Girls Room.\"\n\n> This show was definitely a learning experience, thanks to everyone involved\n> and to those who still believes in me!\n> [pic.twitter.com/zMyGLEFcep](https://t.co/zMyGLEFcep)\n>\n> -- Nina Lee (@NinaSerafina) [February 23,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/NinaSerafina/status/1231391771978014720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n\nShe further explained:\n\n\"I made a lot of mistakes when it came to this show. Mistakes I can still\nfeel. And I wish I knew then what I know now. We were young and didn\u2019t know\nwhat we had on our hands. But thanks everyone involved! I\u2019ve written 4 shows\nsince then so if you\u2019re an investor holla at me. And I have 2 short films and\nthree 125 page feature films. I have content for days \u2014 I\u2019m upset but I\u2019m not\nworried (I\u2019m a little worried haha) but my day is going to come.\"\n\nLee went on to say, \"Even the way her show is colored is oddly similar, I have\nto laugh. Ours was fun as hell though cuz it was about the great drunk girls\nyou meet the girls restroom. And it extended out to their lives and how tough\nand rewarding navigating through life in your 20s can be.\"\n\n> Even the way her show is colored is oddly similar, I have to laugh.

But she claims to be for the community,\" one\n[Twitter user wrote.\n](https://twitter.com/SUPERI0RTEEZ/status/1231739185779761152)\n\nSome folks even noticed that the lead characters in Waithe's show were named\nafter the [**Little Rock Nine**](https://newsone.com/3749349/little-rock-nine-\nanniversary-photos-video-quotes-central-high-desegregation/) \u2014 the group of\nBlack teenagers who first integrated a racially segregated Little Rock Central\nHigh in 1957. Folks were confused as to why the show would reference real-life\ntrailblazers that seem to have nothing to do with the story.\n\n\"Lena Waithe\u2019s work is literally a product of the afterlife of BLM,\" one\nTwitter [user\nwrote](https://twitter.com/ZalUIbaorimi/status/1231628441713303552). \"Like you\nnamed those characters after the Little Rock 9? Everything she creates is\nliterally 'tweet worthy'. It\u2019s all so intentional that it\u2019s scary.

We lost most of our footage.\nWe tried crowdfunding but it was unsuccessful, other things happened and the\nshow we thought was going to change our lives, a show I wrote/created \u2014 became\nsomething painful for me to even talk about.

[ ](/my/account/emailthispage/) __\n5 comments __\n\nThe myth of the trigger-happy traffic warden was shown by my joining the\npatrol to be just that - a myth.\n\nAt least if Lukasz Pepel is anything to go by.\n\nLukasz has been a traffic warden - more accurately a civil enforcement officer\n- with power to issue fines on things like littering as well as bad parking,\nfor a few months.\n\nAnd during the 80 minutes I spent with him and the team he issued just the one\nfixed penalty notice.\n\nAnd that was only after he'd given the driver 30 minutes grace. He had noticed\na workman's van parked on double yellow lines in Regent Circus at the start of\nour walk around the centre.\n\nAfter 30 minutes we had returned back to the same place, and the van was still\nthere. So a ticket was issued.\n\nElsewhere, particularly on Commercial Road, he had plenty of opportunity to\nslap a fine on cars parked illegally, on yellow lines, or even fully on the\npavement.\n\nBut if the driver was present then he would have a quick word and politely ask\nthem to move, if they weren't, he'd note the time and watch for a while.\nNoticing him prompted one woman to hurry out of a shop and drive her SUV away.\n\nLukasz said: \"I always try to be co-operative and non confrontational. And\nmost people are co-operative back. If I tell them they can't park or worth\nsomewhere they're happy to go.\n\n\"Sometimes people aren't so friendly, and they start on the swearing\nimmediately, but I still try and persuade them to move instead of just issuing\na ticket.\"\n\n[

By the time, he had completed 50 years in the banking industry,\nwithin India and abroad. He was one of the youngest CEOs of Citibank. He was\ninstrumental in building Bajaj's financial services businesses, which is\nvalued at Rs 4.4 lakh crore in the stock market, along with Sanjiv Bajaj\n(younger son of Rahul Bajaj) and Rajeev Jain, who is the managing director of\nBajaj Finance.\n\nHe returned from London in 1967 after having studied from London School of\nEconomics (LSE). Getting a job in Mumbai for Pamnani was not difficult at that\npoint of time. He gave interviews for the job in National and Grindlays Bank,\nUnilever and Tata Administrative Service (TAS). Everybody wanted him to join,\nbut the process was lengthy. Meanwhile, Citibank came up with an offer and the\nbank was swift in onboarding him.\n\n\"Citibank's first interview was at 9 o'clock. The person who interviewed\nsecond asked me what I was doing for lunch. I said I was going home. He said\nif I were free for lunch, he wanted one of his colleagues to meet me for\nlunch. That was the third interview. I had two more interviews on that day.\nThe fifth person, who was the head of western region, was based out of Mumbai.\nThree out of five interviewers were Americans. They sent the offer letter the\nnext day,\" Pamnani said.\n\nPamnani was 22 years old when he joined Citi. The normal rotation and training\nlasted 18 months in Citi at that time. But his training got over in six\nmonths. \"They straight away gave me 35 per cent increase in compensation. My\njoining salary was Rs 1,200. I was part of operations division of the bank at\nthat time,\" Pamnani told BT.\n\nAfter 18 months, he shifted to Calcutta office and later moved to corporate\nbanking as junior relationship manager. He cut his teeth there in building\nrelations with business houses in north-east such as Bangurs and Goenkas. He\ncame back to Mumbai after four years as the operations head of the country's\nlargest region for the bank Western region, replacing a senior executive, who\nwas retiring. Then he became country's second risk officer, and later deputy\nCFO. He became the South India corporate bank head at the age of 31 and it\nhelped him build relations with MA Chidambaram, AC Muthiah and Murugappas.\n\nLater he was brought to Mumbai and appointed as the head of India operations,\nwhich was headed by an American. Three years later, at the age of 37, Pamnani\nbecame the CEO of Citibank India, when Victor Menezes, another young and\nvibrant banker who turned CEO, was moving to Hong Kong.\n\n\"At Citibank, we were always in the managing committee of Indian Banks\nAssociation. The managing directors of most of the banks in the country were\ndirectors in the association. I was the youngest in the managing committee\namong all the mid-fifties MDs of public sector banks. They always looked at me\nlike who was this young punk,\" Pamnani remembered.  \n\nAfter five years, Pamnani moved to Philippines, which was running into\nproblems. It was tough job of five years. He had to negotiate the whole\nsovereign debt with the ministry of finance, which they couldn't pay. The\nrestructuring process alone took two years, he says. \"During that time in\nPhilippines, the country was going through political turmoil. Ferdinand Marcos\nwas under pressure and finally he had to leave. Corazon Aquino succeeded him\nto the post of President. She was weak to handle the issues. I had four\nsecurity guards since I was representing American bank. The left wing people\nwere against the Americans,\" he said.\n\nHe moved to Singapore after that as the Asia Pacific head of private banking.\nIn 1995, he shifted to London to head operations of emerging countries. His\nmother fell ill and she was in coma at that time. So he and his wife came back\nin September 1997. He was the India CEO until his retirement in 2004. During\nthis period, he set up the global services centre, a captive BPO, based out of\nIndia. Because of this, the cost of the bank has come down by one third. This\nbusiness was sold to TCS in 2008.\n\nPamnani had to work for two years after retirement on China strategy. He chose\nto work out of Singapore and came back at the age 62.\n\nThree months before he came back, Rahul Bajaj, who is his wife's sister's\nhusband, called him. \"He knew I was coming back. He was demerging Bajaj Auto\ninto auto and financial services businesses and Sanjiv was going to handle\nfinancial services. He wanted me to help Sanjiv. I was planning to relax and\ntravel around the world after retirement. But I agreed to help Sanjiv because\nthey are from my wife's family,\" he said.\n\nSanjiv and Pamnani sat down to strategise Bajaj Finance. \"We started mainly\nwith some products which were commonly done like consumer durables financing.\nWhich is why that has become central pillar for us,\" he said. Bajaj finance is\nvalued at Rs 2.9 lakh crore in the stock market, while its holding company\nBajaj Finserv is valued at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The journey started from zero.\n\nPamnani picked up the present managing director Rajeev Jain for heading the\noperations. \"Since we had to build from scratch, we went out to hire and we\nwere lucky to get Rajeev Jain. He turned out to be brilliant. He is smart\nbusiness person with great execution skills. His ability to think broadly is\noutstanding,\" he said.\n\nInitially, the trio had different views on the growth plans, but their ideas\nconverged over the years. \"We are so aligned that we don't need to debate on\nanything nowadays. Because the minute someone puts an idea on the table, the\nother two will be on the same page,\" he added and said jokingly that it was\nfrightening that we worked together for over a dozen years. Pamnani became the\nchairman of the holding company Bajaj Finserv last year, after Rahul Bajaj\ntook up the ceremonial post of chairman emeritus.\n\nHe had a good rapport with the former Citibank colleague Aditya Puri, who is\nthe managing director of HDFC bank. Former managing director of Bank of Baroda\nP.S. Jayakumar was his junior. \"Aditya is a no nonsense person. He will take\nhard decision on every loan the bank gives. That is why HDFC Bank is the\nbiggest of the best.\"\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ozzcjJsD0Q1DglEytSZrQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\"You Tube\")\n\n  *

drug-addicts\u2019\nkin](https://cms.tribuneindia.com/gallary_content/2020/3/Desk/2020_3$largeimg_41682066.jpg)\n\n****\n\nParvesh Sharma\n\nTribune News Service\n\nBarnala, March 8\n\nSandeep Goel, who joined as the Barnala SSP last month, has decided to conduct\npersonal meetings with the relatives of drugs addicts to take direct feedback\nabout smugglers and about the working of police officers concerned. He has\nalso asked the local residents to share all information with him directly\nabout illegal activities in their respective areas.\n\n\u201cSince my joining, I, along with my senior officers, have been working hard to\nbreak the supply chain of drugs. I have started getting information and we\nhave been taking quick action also on all information. Besides, we are also\nworking to remove traffic bottlenecks and accelerate the pace of investigation\nof all cases,\u201d the SSP Goel told The Tribune.\n\nIn the seizure of a big cache of drugs on March 6, the Barnala police busted a\nmajor racket allegedly involved in illegal trade of psychotropic drugs and\narrested four persons. The police seized 40,01,040 intoxicating tablets,\ncapsules and injections worth Rs 4-5 crore. Besides, 3 lakh tablets were also\nseized from Dhanauala and three to four more persons were also arrested.\n\n\u201cThe intoxicating tablets worth Rs 4-5 crore were not a big thing for\nsmugglers. But we must understand the social ramifications of such a huge drug\nconsignment. Had we not busted it, the tablets would have destroyed the lives\nof thousands of youngsters,\u201d said the SSP.\n\nAbout his plans to conduct direct meetings with area residents, he said he had\ndecided to launch his campaign in the beginning of this month, but after an\nadvisory of the Health Department to avoid public meetings due to coronavirus,\nhe has postponed his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf any cop is found helping smugglers and involved in illegal activity, the\nguilty would face strict punishment while hard working would get\nappreciation,\u201d said the SSP.\n\nSome sarpanches of various villages, requesting anonymity, told The Tribune\nthat after the SSP decided to take direct feedback from them, they had been\ngetting ready to share all information with them.\n\n\u201cWe would share all detailed information with the SSP about the working of\ncops and officers of other departments to help police in containing drug\nsmuggling in our area,\u201d said a sarpanch.\n\nSHARE ARTICLE\n\n  * [\n\nA -\n\n](javascript:down\\(\\))\n\n  * [\n\nA +\n\n](javascript:up\\(\\))\n\n**What do you think?** (Share your feedback)\n\n__Like\n\n__Dislike\n\nMost

Kalappa](https://www.newindianexpress.com/author/Bansy-\nKalappa/19765)\n\nExpress News Service\n\nBENGALURU: As Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa strives hard to convince the BJP\ncentral leadership to allot ministerial berths for the 'rebel winners', it's\nthe rebel losers who find themselves in a Catch-22 situation.\n\nThey are the great gamblers who lost the game of dice, and they know it.\nFormer sitting minister MTB Nagaraj and then JDS party president Adagur H\nVishwanath, who risked their all in the high-stakes political game, could just\nfade into insignificance.\n\nThey propped up the Yediyurappa government, yet the chief minister hasn't\nindicated that he will do anything about inducting the losers into his\ncabinet. Nagaraj gave up his position as a cabinet minister in the coalition\ngovernment, and Vishwanath his post of JDS party president.\n\nVishwanath's desire was to be a minister when he gave up his position and\nresigned as MLA. But in the following months, the Kuruba leader was reduced to\nan insignificant player in the state's political drama. A leader with over 44\nyears of political experience, the man who became MLA before Siddaramaiah and\nYediyurappa, resisted the idea of a career fade out.\n\nHe told TNIE, \"It was because of my joining them that the rebellion of the 17\nMLAs to break away from the coalition assumed legitimacy.'\" Vishwanath sounds\npained when recalling that the switchover of the 17 MLAs was spoken of as\n'Marata sale' and not 'Horata struggle'. \"It was our sacrifice that brought\ndown the government,\" he said.\n\n**ALSO READ |  [Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa gets high command nod, will expand\ncabinet by next\nweek](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2020/jan/31/karnataka-\ncm-bs-yediyurappa-gets-high-command-nod-will-expand-cabinet-by-next-\nweek-2096952.html)**\n\nJust as Chamarajanagar MP Srinivasa Prasad had said earlier, Ramesh Jarkiholi\nmaintained that all 17 MLAs, including Vishwanath and Nagaraj, have to be\naccommodated and there was no going back on it.\n\nAsked if he feared that Yediyurappa had betrayed them, Vishwanath said, \"In\npolitics, everything is not out in the open, there are some issues which are\nhidden  (antharanga) and are not visible to the outside world.\"\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, Vishwanath and Nagaraj will be given positions as\nMLCs in June, and accommodated in the ministry.\n\nWhile some are saying that the 17 rebels cannot be trusted to be completely\nloyal to the BJP, and would return to their parent parties after the term of\nthis government, Vishwanath shot back, \"We have gone to Keshava Krupa and\njoined the BJP. Why will we go back?''\n\n**If Savadi can become DCM, I can become minister:  AH Vishwanath\u200b**\n\nMYSURU: \"Chief minister BS Yediyurappa should answer why he is denying me a\nministerial berth,\" said former minister AH Vishwanath, further urging the CM\nto remember that it is because of the BJP came to power in the state.\n\n\"If Laxman Savadi, who lost the 2018 assembly elections can be made deputy\nchief minister, then why are others denied cabinet post based on whether they\nwon or lost election,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, former union minister and BJP MP V Srinivasa Prasad said that CM\nshould immediately consider expansion as the 17 MLAs who left Congress and JDS\nare losing their patience as CM himself promised them cabinet seats.\n\nStay up to date on all the latest\n[Karnataka](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka) news with The\nNew Indian Express App. [ Download\nnow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newindianexpress.news)\n\nTAGS\n\n[BS Yediyurappa](https://www.newindianexpress.com/topic/BS_Yediyurappa)[\nKarnataka ministerial\nberths](https://www.newindianexpress.com/topic/Karnataka_ministerial_berths)[\nAdagur H\nVishwanath](https://www.newindianexpress.com/topic/Adagur_H_Vishwanath)[ MTB\nNagaraj ](https://www.newindianexpress.com/topic/MTB_Nagaraj)[ Karnataka\ncabinet\nexpansion](https://www.newindianexpress.com/topic/Karnataka_cabinet_expansion)\n\n[__](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2020/jan/31/former-\nkarnataka-ministers-during-jds-congress-coalition-lose-vip-\nsecurity-2096980.html \"Former Karnataka ministers, during JDS-Congress\ncoalition,\u00a0lose VIP security\")\n[__](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2020/jan/31/where-\nthere-is-pain-there-is-gain-former-karnataka-minister-dk-\nshivakumar-2096984.html \"Where there is pain, there is gain: Former\u00a0Karnataka\nminister DK Shivakumar\")\n\nO  \nP  \nE  \nN\n\n![](https://d7.zedo.com/img/bh.gif?n=791&g=20&a=87&s=1&l=1&t=r&f=1)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Coronavirus](\n\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/coronavirus)\n\n[![](https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X300.jpg)](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-kerala-sets-up-indias-first-walk-in-kiosk-wisk-\nfor-sample-collection-108308.html)\n\n[Kerala sets up India\u2019s first walk-in kiosk for sample collection\n](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-kerala-sets-up-indias-first-walk-in-kiosk-wisk-\nfor-sample-collection-108308.html)\n\n[![](https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X300.jpg)](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-outbreak-bhilwaras-quartet-leads-the-hotspot-\non-path-to-recovery-108307.html)\n\n[Bhilwara\u2019s quartet leads the corona hotspot on path to recovery\n](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-outbreak-bhilwaras-quartet-leads-the-hotspot-\non-path-to-recovery-108307.html)\n\n[![](https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X300.jpg)](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/zooming-through-hyderabads-streets-heres-a-corona-\ncar-108306.html)\n\n[Zooming through Hyderabad's streets: Here's a corona\ncar!](https://www.newindianexpress.com/videos/videos-\nnation/2020/apr/07/zooming-through-hyderabads-streets-heres-a-corona-\ncar-108306.html)\n\n[![People wearing masks, walk across a street in Hong Kong, Monday, Feb. 24,\n2020.

\u00a31,412 with their Christmas fair\nin the Airedale Shopping Centre.\n\nThey will also receive money raised through a Memory Tree placed in the\nentrance lobby of Keighley Market in memory of a stallholder's late mother.\n\nStaff and volunteers from Dementia Friendly Keighley (DFK) left their busy\nChristmas fair to nip across the market to thank Yvonne Bryant for her\nefforts.\n\nYvonne runs the market's Just4Paws stall and created the Memory Tree in\ntribute to parents Barry and Catherine Bryant. Catherine died this year.\n\nAnyone who wants to remember a loved one this Christmas can make a donation in\nexchange for adding their own dedication card to the tree.\n\nYvonne is also the managing director of Bryant Plastics, and has made it one\nof the firm's charities for the festive season alongside Manorlands hospice.\n\nAs well as the Memory Tree, Yvonne has set up a tree, decorated with colourful\nlights and dozens of moving miniature models of buildings and funfairs, to\nattract people as they enter the main market.\n\nAdditional seasonal attractions, all with donation buckets for DFK and\nManorlands, include a winter wonderland in a vacant stall with Father\nChristmas in attendance, and a wood cabin winter scene.\n\nYvonne said: \"Every year I try and do something for local charities but I was\nespecially motivated to set up the Memory Tree display this Christmas as I'm\nfeeling the loss of my Mum, particularly at this festive time.\n\n\"This seemed a very appropriate way to remember her and my Dad, and raise some\nfunds for two local charities\".\n\nDFK chairman Jan Smithies set every penny donated will be put to very good\nuse.\n\n\"My mum Nell died this year, and her struggle with dementia was one of the\nmotivating factors in my joining the Board of DFK. I can relate to Yvonne's\nMemory Tree and will be hanging my own memory of my mum and making a donation.\n\n\"Yvonne has done a great job in making a very welcoming, colourful display\nacross several parts of the market and I would encourage people to look at\nwhat's on offer at the stalls as well as visiting the festive attractions and\nmaking a donation.\"\n\nHelen Charters, DFK's Drop-In Manager, said the \u00a31,412 raised the Christmas\nfair was an increase of \u00a3600 on the charity''s previous Airedale Centre\nfundraiser.\n\nShe said: \"We had some fantastic quality donations from local people and\nbusinesses to ensure we got lots of customers at the various stalls. We had\nover a dozen volunteers helping us to get ready the week before and staffing\nthe stalls on the day as well as many volunteer bakers.\"\n\n[\n](whatsapp://send?text=Memory%20tree%20raises%20money%20for%20Dementia%20Friendly%20Keighley%0A%0Ahttps://www.keighleynews.co.uk%2Fnews%2F18098025.memory-\ntree-raises-money-dementia-friendly-keighley%2F%3fref%3Dwa) [ ](fb-\nmessenger://share/?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keighleynews.co.uk/news/18098025.memory-\ntree-raises-money-dementia-friendly-\nkeighley/%3fref%3Dfbm&app_id=194363240588264) [ ](/my/account/emailthispage/)\n__ 0 comment __\n\n  * Most read\n  * Commented\n\nLoading...\n\n  1. ![]()\n\n  2. \n\nRead more __\n\n  1. ![]()\n\n__\n\nGet involved with the news in your community\n\n[Send your stories and photos now](/send-us-your-news)\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n  * \n  [\n\n###\n\n]()\n\n![]()\n\nBy []() [ ]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[![]()]()\n\n[Continue reading __]()\n\n[ ](/news/18365736.oxenhope-hospice-manorlands-faces-closure-funding-crisis-\nhits-sue-ryder-charity/)\n\n[\n\n## Oxenhope hospice Manorlands faces closure as funding crisis hits Sue Ryder\ncharity\n\n](/news/18365736.oxenhope-hospice-manorlands-faces-closure-funding-crisis-\nhits-sue-ryder-charity/)\n\n[ ](/news/18365730.coronavirus-play-workers-help-deliver-food-parcels-\nkeighley-folk/)\n\n[\n\n## CORONAVIRUS: Play workers help deliver food parcels to Keighley folk\n\n](/news/18365730.coronavirus-play-workers-help-deliver-food-parcels-keighley-\nfolk/)\n\n[ ](/news/18366426.keighley-author-draws-bangladeshi-heritage-debut-novel/)\n\n[\n\n## Keighley author draws on Bangladeshi heritage for debut novel\n\n](/news/18366426.keighley-author-draws-bangladeshi-heritage-debut-novel/)\n\n[ ](/news/18365981.mr-jangles-helping-youngsters-read/)\n\n[\n\n## Mr Jangles helping youngsters to read\n\n](/news/18365981.mr-jangles-helping-youngsters-read/)\n\n[ ](/news/18365734.spicy-sausage-dish-ideal-lockdown-living/)\n\n[\n\n## Spicy sausage dish ideal for lockdown living\n\n](/news/18365734.spicy-sausage-dish-ideal-lockdown-living/)\n\n[ ](/news/18363190.coronavirus-airedale-hospital-patients-can-now-receive-\nspecial-parcels-messages-loved-ones/)\n\n[\n\n## CORONAVIRUS: Airedale Hospital patients can now receive special parcels and\nmessages from loved ones\n\n](/news/18363190.coronavirus-airedale-hospital-patients-can-now-receive-\nspecial-parcels-messages-loved-ones/)\n\n[__1](/news/18363190.coronavirus-airedale-hospital-patients-can-now-receive-\nspecial-parcels-messages-loved-ones/#comments-anchor \"Read comments\")\n\n[ ](/news/18363974.keighley-yoga-teacher-wins-inspirational-woman-award/)\n\n[\n\n## Keighley yoga teacher wins Inspirational Woman award\n\n](/news/18363974.keighley-yoga-teacher-wins-inspirational-woman-award/)\n\n[ ](/news/18363254.winter-time-jealousy/)\n\n[\n\n## Jealousy and hate as A Winter's Tale comes to Bradford\n\n](/news/18363254.winter-time-jealousy/)\n\n[ ](/news/18363164.opera-north-delivers-productions-fans-homes-lockdown/)\n\n[\n\n## Opera North delivers productions to fans\u2019 homes during the lockdown\n\n](/news/18363164.opera-north-delivers-productions-fans-homes-lockdown/)\n\n  * Most popular\n  * Commented\n\nLoading...\n\n  1. \n\nRead more __\n\n  1. \n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact/)\n  * [Newsletters](/emailbulletins/)\n  * [Photo Sales](http://www.keighleynews.co.uk//photosales/)\n  * [Newsquest Printing](http://www.newsquestprinting.co.uk/)\n  * [Advertise](/advertising/)\n  * [Archive](/archive/)\n  * [Site Map](/misc/sitemap/)\n  * [Announcements](/announcements/)\n  * [Leap](http://leap.keighleynews.co.uk)\n  * [Exchange and Mart](https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/terms-conditions/)\n  * [Privacy Policy](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Cookie Policy](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/cookie-policy/)\n  * [Manage Consent](/gdpr/)\n  * [Terms of Advertising](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/terms-of-advertising/)\n  * [Contributor Terms](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/contributor-terms/)\n  * [Diversity Statement](http://www.newsquest.co.uk/diversity-statement/)\n\nIpsoregulated\n\nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

On the brink of defeat, Hitler\ncommissioned 10,000 V2s\u2013ballistic rockets that carried a one-ton warhead at\nthree times the speed of sound, which he believed would win the war.\n\n\"Dr Rudi Graf, who, along with his friend Werner von Braun, had once dreamt of\nsending a rocket to the moon, now finds himself in November 1944 in a bleak\nseaside town in Occupied Holland, launching V2s against London. No one\nunderstands the volatile, deadly machine better than Graf, but his\ndisillusionment with the war leads to him being investigated for sabotage,\"\nreads the synopsis. \"Kay Caton-Walsh, an officer in the WAAF, has experienced\nfirst-hand the horror of a V2 strike. When 160 Londoners, mostly women and\nchildren, are killed by a single missile, the government decides to send a\nteam of WAAFs to newly liberated Belgium in the hope of discovering the\nlocation of the launch sites. But not all the Germans have left and Kay finds\nherself in mortal danger. As the war reaches its desperate end, their twin\nstories play out, interlocked and separate, until their destinies are finally\nforced together.\"\n\nHarris said: \"This year marks the 30th anniversary of my joining Hutchinson,\nand this will be the sixth of my novels to be edited by Jocasta. I am very\nlucky to have such brilliant publishers, who have always encouraged me to keep\nwriting about different things, from ancient Roman to artificial intelligence.\n_V2_ is a return to my original fascination with the moral dilemmas of working\nunder the Nazis.\"\n\nHamilton added: \"Tense, shocking and absolutely gripping, _V2_ , like _Munich_\n, enables the reader to view the Second World War from an entirely new\nperspective. We\u2019re absolutely delighted to be continuing Hutchinson\u2019s long-\nstanding, bestselling relationship with Robert.\"\n\n_V2_ is Harris' 14th novel. Through the Nielsen BookScan TCM in the UK he has\nsold 4.37 million books for \u00a333.5m, with 2008's  _The Ghost_ (Arrow) his\nbestseller at 350,819 copies sold in paperback.\n\n  *

](/my/account/emailthispage/) __\n0 comment __\n\n_By Alfie Thomas_\n\nEASTHAMPSTEAD Rotary Club turned the Coppid Beech Hotel purple on October 24\nto mark World Polio Day.\n\nThis came on the same day the eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) was\ndeclared; as a part of the Rotary Club's End Polio Now campaign.\n\nSuzie Mcroy, who has personal experience of Polio and who is the first\nEasthampstead Rotarian, said: \"This achievement means that two of the three\nwild Polio strains have now been wiped out, an important milestone in the\nfight to rid the world of Polio.\n\n[**READ MORE: Bookkeepers covered up drug smuggling\nevidence**](https://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/news/18003755.bracknell-forest-\ncouncil-auditors-ey-covered-drug-smuggling-evidence/)\n\n\"I have always supported the fight against Polio and it was one of the main\nfactors in my joining Easthampstead Rotary Club.\n\n\"I am so pleased to see The Coppid Beech Hotel lit up in purple for the week\naround World Polio Day.\"\n\nReportedly, the virus is only the third infectious disease pathogen to be\nwiped out in human history, after Smallpox and Polio Type 2.\n\n![Bracknell News: ](/resources/images/10612877.jpg?type=article-full)\n\nVaccination is the only solution for staying safe against the virus and it is\nadministered in five doses during a person's childhood and is usually free on\nthe NHS.\n\nSome 40 years ago, Polio was widespread and could cause rare symptoms that\ncould be life-threatening.\n\nIt was being diagnosed in 350,000 children across 125 countries four decades\nago.\n\nBut those cases fell in the UK after routine vaccinations were introduced, and\nthis led to the elimination of the disease in the UK by the 1990s.\n\nAfter international efforts, the international number of cases dropped to 74\nin 2015, and 33 in 2018.\n\n![Bracknell News: ](/resources/images/10612876.jpg?type=article-full)\n\nCoppid Beech Hotel had posters and information displays put up in their hotel\nlobby, informing guests and visitors about the End Polio Now campaign and the\npurple facade.\n\nThe colour was chosen as it represents a temporary purple mark put on a\nvaccinated person's finger.\n\n[**NOW READ: Here's how much your child's school lost in funding in the last\nfive years**](https://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/news/18003542.bracknell-forest-\nschools-funding-cuts-since-2015/)\n\nEasthampstead Rotary Club has also completed other actions to keep the\ncampaign in local consciousness, including film showings, donation sands, and\nplanting purple crocus bulbs, leaving a legacy for next spring.\n\n[\n](whatsapp://send?text=This%20is%20why%20Coppid%20Beech%20Hotel%20turned%20purple%20last%20week%0A%0Ahttps://www.bracknellnews.co.uk%2Fnews%2F18006004.coppid-\nbeech-hotel-turned-purple-polio-last-week%2F%3fref%3Dwa)

He describes his career\nprogression for the [Dezeen Jobs careers\nguide](https://www.dezeenjobs.com/2019/09/10/careers-guide-ece-architecture-\narchitectural-visualiser-tom-dutfield/).\n\nDutfield creates imagery for a range of interior and architectural projects at\nECE Architecture, producing visual output and modelling schemes using\nrendering [software](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/software/) including Revit and\nSketchUp.\n\nHis long-term responsibilities include providing insight on how to improve the\nquality of work, both through research and development, and through the use of\nemerging technologies.\n\nDutfield's interest in 3D graphics was sparked while he was studying creative\ndigital media for his undergraduate degree. He credits the subject range for\ngiving him \"a chance to explore many different subject matters, from\ncontextual studies and fine art, to computer programming and game design\".\n\nIt was after completing his dissertation, which comprised a flythrough of a\nhouse created using 3D-modelling and animation, that he realised architectural\nvisualisation was his calling.\n\n\"The whole process was extremely exciting and seeing the end-product had me\nsold on a career in architectural visualisation,\" he said. \"There was no\nlooking back from that point.\"\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2019/06/foster-\npartners-art-director-narinder-sagoo-dezeen-jobs-careers-guide-sq-191x191.jpg)\n\n# Related story\n\n## Careers guide: Narinder Sagoo explains how he came to oversee the visual\noutput of Foster + Partners\n\n](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/26/careers-guide-foster-partners-narinder-\nsagoo/)\n\nHe began his career freelancing for architectural illustration firm Retina\nImages, after which he continued to work at companies that specialised in CGI\nand rendering.\n\nHaving mastered his visualisation skills, Dutfield wanted to embark on a new\nchallenge, which led him to explore working at an architecture firm, rather\nthan a visualisation studio.\n\n\"For the large part of my career I've spent creating an end-product, mostly\nfor marketing, which means working from a finished design,\" he explained.\n\"With ECE, I often have the chance to work on various stages of the design.\"\n\nThe opportunity to be involved in the design process ultimately led to\nDutfield becoming part of the firm.\n\n\"Prior to my joining, ECE had not had an in-house visualiser before, so it was\na chance to put my mark on what I was doing,\" he said.\n\nDutfield has since worked on a number of architectural projects, including the\nSussex County Cricket masterplan, which comprises residential, commercial and\nleisure spaces.\n\n\"It's been great to illustrate the design and see it evolve, and be a part of\nthe process at different stages,\" he said.\n\nDutfield described the \"quest for inspiration\" as what has helped him stay\nmotivated throughout his career: \"You know it's going to come eventually, but\nit's the excitement and anticipation of not knowing where or when.\"\n\n[Read the interview on Dezeen Jobs\n\u203a](https://www.dezeenjobs.com/2019/09/10/careers-guide-ece-architecture-\narchitectural-visualiser-tom-dutfield/)\n\nRead more:\n\n  * [Dezeen Jobs](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dezeen-architecture-design-jobs/)\n  * [Careers guide](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/careers-guide/)\n\n## Subscribe to our newsletters\n\nDezeen Daily  Dezeen Weekly\n\n**Dezeen Daily** is sent every day and contains all the latest stories from\nDezeen.\n\n **Dezeen Weekly** is a curated newsletter that is sent every Thursday,\ncontaining highlights from Dezeen.

But Lalu\u2019s old acolyte is unwilling to\ngive any respite to his erstwhile party.\n\nI will not go back to RJD. I have made up my mind, Mohammed Ali Ashraf Fatmi\ntold India Today. Fatmi also remained non-committal when asked if he would\nback Congress rebel and former Union minister Shakeel Ahmed from this seat. My\nwell-wishers and friends suggested that my presence in the contest might help\nthe BJP in this election and hence I decided to withdraw from the contest.\nNow, I will consult my supporters and act accordingly, Fatmi said.\n\nThough Fatmi had formally joined the BSP for contesting the seat, he is not\ngoing to continue in Mayawati\u2019s party too. I am a free bird now. My joining\nBSP was just a formality. It was a one-day affair. I am out of the party the\nmoment I withdrew my candidature, he said.\n\nA section of JDU leaders believes that the ex-RJD man will finally switch his\nallegiance to Nitish Kumar\u2019s party after the Lok Sabha elections are over.\nFatmi\u2019s recent attack against Sharad Yadav, a former JDU president-turned-RJD\nman, is seen as an indicator of things to happen.\n\nThe RJD-led grand alliance in Bihar has five parties on board. While RJD is\ncontesting 19, having given one seat from its quota to CPIML, the Congress has\n9 seats and Upendra Kushwaha\u2019s RLSP five seats. Jitan Ram Manjhi\u2019s HAM and\nMukesh Sahni\u2019s VIP party have been given three seats each to contest.\n\nFatmi had quit the RJD after he was denied a party ticket from Madhubani. He\nsubsequently filed his nomination papers as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)\ncandidate. The voting for the Madhubani seat is scheduled in the fifth phase\non May 6. The VIP has fielded Badri Kumar Purbey from the seat. He is pitted\nagainst BJP\u2019s candidate Ashok Yadav, son of outgoing Madhubani MP Hukmdev\nNarayan Yadav, from the seat.\n\nThe RJD rebel may have withdrawn, but the Congress rebel and former Union\nminister Shakeel Ahmed has thrown his hat in the ring, calling VIP party\ncandidate as a weak contestant. Earlier, Fatmi too had put forward the same\nargument to file his nomination papers.\n\n **READ |[Campaign ends for five Lok Sabha seats

So my fascination for arts has been since childhood. But I decided to\nforay into films after winning a reality show in 2012. My parents, who were\ninitially against my joining films, started supporting me after my win.\"\nrecalls Rahasya.\n\nBorn and raised in Hyderabad, Rahasya has apparently worked in a couple of\nshort films. \"So I wasn't camera shy and was game to start shooting for the\nfilm,\" she reveals.\n\nTalking about Raja Varu Rani Garu, the actress says it's a rustic romantic\ndrama that deals with the fear of rejection. \"The lead pair falls is in love\nbut they don't express their feelings fearing that they can't take pain if\nthey are rejected,\" explains Rahasya, who plays the role of a village belle.\n\n\"I enjoyed the filmmaking experience. Additionally, I have an insight into how\nvarious crafts work,\" says the actress who will soon debut in Tamil with the\nfilm Sarbat with Kathir.\n\n...\n\nTags: [rahasya gorak](/content/tags/rahasya-gorak), [kiran\nabbavaram](/content/tags/kiran-abbavaram), [raja varu rani\ngaru](/content/tags/raja-varu-rani-garu)\n\n  \n  \n\n## Latest From Entertainment\n\n[ ![Paul Walker with daughter Meadow \\(Instagram\\)](/images/blank_dc.png)\n\n### Paul Walker's daughter shares adorable throwback video of her late father\n\n](/entertainment/hollywood/080420/paul-walkers-daughter-shares-adorable-\nthrowback-video-of-her-late-\nfat.html?utm_source=latestPromotion&utm_medium=end&utm_campaign=latest)\n\n[ ![Actor Indrans \\(Twitter\\)](/images/blank_dc.png)\n\n### Malayalam comedian now making masks for covid19\n\n](/entertainment/mollywood/080420/malayalam-comedian-now-making-masks-for-\ncovid19.html?utm_source=latestPromotion&utm_medium=end&utm_campaign=latest)\n\n[ ![Actor Purab Kohli \\(Twitter\\)](/images/blank_dc.png)\n\n### 'Rock On' actor Purab Kohli says he and family just recovered from\nCOVID-19\n\n](/entertainment/bollywood/080420/rock-on-actor-purab-kohli-says-he-and-\nfamily-just-recovered-from-\ncov.html?utm_source=latestPromotion&utm_medium=end&utm_campaign=latest)\n\n[ ![First look of Allu Arjun starrer 'Pushpa'](/images/blank_dc.png)\n\n### First look of Allu Arjun starrer 'Pushpa' released on his birthday\n\n](/entertainment/tollywood/080420/first-look-of-allu-arjun-starrer-pushpa-\nreleased-on-his-\nbirthday.html?utm_source=latestPromotion&utm_medium=end&utm_campaign=latest)\n\n  \n  \n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## [MOST POPULAR](/most-popular)\n\n[  \n\n### You may be stuck at home but now Tinder lets you connect to users across\nborders\n\n![ \u201cNow more than ever, having someone to talk to makes a world of a\ndifference,\u201d says the tagline for Passport on the Go Tinder\nblog](/images/blank_dc.png) ](/technology/in-other-news/050420/you-may-be-\nstuck-at-home-but-now-tinder-lets-you-connect-to-users-acro.html)\n\n[  \n\n### Aakar Patel: What will the new economy look like post Covid-19 crash?\n\n![People thrown out of livelihoods sit down for a meal at a soup kitchen set\nup by the Delhi government at a temporary shelter in the Nizamuddin area. \\(DC\nPhoto: Pritam Bandyopadhyay\\)](/images/blank_dc.png)\n](/opinion/columnists/050420/aakar-patel-what-will-the-new-economy-look-like-\npost-covid-19-crash.html)\n\n[  \n\n### Waqyanavis: So cops looked the other way 'coz Tablighi Jamaat sends them\nfree food?\n\n![Health workers sanitize the area near the Nizamuddin mosque after people who\nattended a religious congregation organised by the Tablighi Jamaat where\nCovid-19 positive persons spread the virus to other participants. \\(DC Photo:\nPritam Bandyopadhyay\\)](/images/blank_dc.png)\n](/opinion/columnists/050420/waqyanavis-so-cops-looked-the-other-way-coz-\ntablighi-jamaat-sends-th.html)\n\n[  \n\n### These COVID-19 trackers map the spread of infection by country, state and\ndistrict\n\n![A screenshot of covindia.netlify.com shows a timelapse map of infections\nspreading through districts.](/images/blank_dc.png) ](/technology/in-other-\nnews/260320/these-covid-19-trackers-map-the-spread-of-infection-by-country-\nstate.html)\n\n[  \n\n### Buying ventilators?

That is the Local government with the highest voting\nstrength. Definitely, that Local government is for APC. I come from Nembe LG\nand by my joining APC, Nembe has fallen into the hands of APC.\n\n>  **ALSO READ:[Public outcry over N5.5bn SUV purchase insulting \u2015\n> Senate](https://tribuneonlineng.com/public-outcry-over-n5-5bn-suv-purchase-\n> insulting-%e2%80%95-senate/)**\n\n\"Brass is where Timipre Sylva comes from and Brass normally is for APC. And I\nalso assisted APC in winning my own Senatorial district in the last election.\nI also assisted APC in winning House of Representatives seat during February\nelection. So, those three LGs are gone and we can give Kolokuma/Opokuma, the\nsmallest local government to PDP because their candidate is from there. \"Then,\nthe Sagbama Local Government Area where the present governor comes from, will\nbe donated to the present governor because his running mate is from Sagbama\nLG.\n\n\"Where the governor comes from, is where he picks running mate to PDP\ncandidate. The question is, what will other LGs do? We can still donate that\nto him, so, we are taking three, they are taking two. The remaining LGs is\n50/50.\"\n\nAccusing the incumbent governor, Seriake Dickson of muzzling other chieftains\nof the party, Senator Amange said it would be a miracle if the PDP won the\nforthcoming governorship election.\n\n\"When I was in PDP, we were enslaved by only one man who regarded himself as\nemperor. There was no political activities there even if you want to be a\nCouncillor. The 105 councillors were nominated by him. The eight chairmen were\nnominated by him, so, I cannot be a party to what is going on in PDP.\n\n\"I was one of the founding fathers of PDP in Bayelsa State. I did not join the\nPDP. I took part on the formation of PDP here in August 1998 and I have been\nthere since. But I have never seen this kind of authoritarian rule. So, I have\ndecided to pitch my tent with a party that can uproot this bottom from the\nground, so that, Bayelsans will be freed, and I promise you, Bayelsans will be\nfreed come November 16, 2019.\"\n\n__[APC](https://tribuneonlineng.com/tag/apc/)[Bayelsa](https://tribuneonlineng.com/tag/bayelsa/)[PDP](https://tribuneonlineng.com/tag/pdp/)\n\n__**Share**\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftribuneonlineng.com%2Fbayelsa-2019-aggrieved-\npdp-aspirant-joins-apc%2F)[\n__Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?text=Bayelsa+2019%3A+Aggrieved+PDP+aspirant+joins+APC\n@nigeriantribune&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftribuneonlineng.com%2Fbayelsa-2019-aggrieved-\npdp-aspirant-joins-apc%2F)[\n__Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftribuneonlineng.com%2Fbayelsa-2019-aggrieved-\npdp-aspirant-joins-apc%2F)[\n__ReddIt](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftribuneonlineng.com%2Fbayelsa-2019-aggrieved-\npdp-aspirant-joins-\napc%2F&title=Bayelsa+2019%3A+Aggrieved+PDP+aspirant+joins+APC)[\n__WhatsApp](whatsapp://send?text=Bayelsa+2019%3A+Aggrieved+PDP+aspirant+joins+APC\n%0A%0A

FRANCISCO, October 06, (THEWILL) - Nigeria\u2019s Israel Adesanya, aka\nStylebender, has become the undisputed UFC middleweight champion after\ndethroning Robert Whittaker in the main event of UFC 234 in Melbourne.\n\nAdesanya arrived in the match-up as the interim champion but left no doubt as\nto who the best middleweight is by knocking out Whittaker with a right hook-\nleft hook combination at 3 minutes, 33 seconds of the second round in front of\nalmost 60,000 fans at the marvel stadium.\n\nAdesanya dropped Whittaker right at the first-round bell and the crowd erupted\nat the sequence, and no one could hear the bell that ended the round but\nreferee Marc Goddard was on top of the action and stopped it before Adesanya\ncould follow up.\n\nThe 30-year-old Nigerian has won all seven of his fights in the UFC and is\nunbeaten in 18 MMA bouts with 14 coming by knockout or TKO.\n\nBefore leaving the octagon, Adesanya called out his likely next opponent,\nPaulo costa and both proceeded to exchange words with Adesanya referring to\nthe Brazilian as an \u201coverly inflated balloon animal in his post-fight\ninterview.\n\n[Follow

\"email\")\n\n### Senators 5, Canucks 2\n\nTears of joy. Tears of thanks. Tears of victory.\n\nBobby Ryan didn't even pretend to hide the emotion of it all after delivering\nthe comeback of all comebacks Thursday.\n\nPlaying his first game at Canadian Tire Centre since Nov. 15 -- and only his\nsecond overall -- since leaving the NHL's substance abuse program after\nwinning his battle with alcohol, Ryan scored a hat trick in the Ottawa\nSenators' 5-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks. Ryan added a first-period fight\nfor good measure.\n\nBefore Thursday's outburst, Ryan hadn't scored since the season opener on Oct.\n2. The hat trick was his first since Dec. 29, 2014. Ryan was greeted with\nchants of \"Bob-bee, Bob-bee\" throughout the contest.\n\n![](https://postmediaottawasun.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hockey-nhl-ott-\nvan-.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640)\n\nBobby Ryan celebrates with the team after scoring his first of three goals\nagainst the Vancouver Canucks at the Canadian Tire Centre. Marc DesRosiers /\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\n\"I knew Ottawa, being the community that it is, that the reception would be\ngood,\" said Ryan. \"It just got harder to keep the emotions down throughout the\ngame. It was incredible how they supported me. And I guess to contribute. I\nmean, you can't write that, the way that went. It was just an incredible\nevening. So thank you to all of them.\"\n\nConnor Brown opened the scoring for the Senators at the 7:13 mark and Ryan\nfollowed up with his first goal only 31 seconds later, resulting in the first\n\"Bob-bee, Bob-bee\" chant of the night. The first period ended with Ryan\nfighting the Canucks' Christopher Tanev, taking issue with a slash across the\nlegs.\n\n![](https://postmediaottawasun.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hockey-nhl-ott-\nvan-1-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640)\n\nOttawa Senators goalie Marcus Hogberg makes a save on a shot from Vancouver\nCanucks left wing Antoine Roussel in the first period at the Canadian Tire\nCentre. Marc DesRosiers / USA TODAY Sports\n\nJ. T. Miller scored for the Canucks with 16 seconds left in the second period\nand Rudolfs Balcers restored the two-goal Senators lead only 14 seconds into\nthe third period. After Tyler Toffoli made it 3-2 at the 8:16 mark of the\nthird period, the Canucks were in position to tie the game.\n\nBut then came the remarkable finish, with Ryan scoring the Senators' fourth\nand fifth goals, only 19 seconds apart, to put the game out of reach.\n\n![](https://postmediaottawasun.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hockey-nhl-ott-\nvan-1-9.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640)\n\nBobby Ryan is congratulated by teammates after completing the hat trick. Marc\nDesRosiers / USA TODAY Sports\n\nRyan paid tribute to his wife, Danielle, for her help in getting him through\nhis off-ice battle with booze. She was in the building, taking it all in,\nalong with the other 12,165 fans.\n\n\"Everything,\" Ryan said when asked about what her presence meant. \"This is \u2026\nwe've talked about our first game back and the emotions, and I'm glad I got\nthe first one out of the way (a 3-2 loss to Nashville on Tuesday). To come\nhome and know she was going to be there. To have her support, not just as a\nhockey player, but as a husband and everything, means a ton.\"\n\n> Congrats Bobby Ryan. The league is better when you\u2019re in it.\n> [#NHL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#OttawaSenators](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OttawaSenators?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> <https://t.co/A260sbbbdH>\n>\n> -- Phil Evans (@philevanshfx) [February 28,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/philevanshfx/status/1233236562672005122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nRyan, who played on a line with Brady Tkachuk and Belleville call-up Josh\nNorris, says his goal for the remainder of the season is to do what he can to\nhelp in the big-picture rebuilding effort.\n\n\"I just want to finish the season as strong as I can and contribute and help\nthese guys close it out the right way,\" he said. \"They gave me a chance to\nplay with two very, very good young players that are going to be the future of\nthis club. So, I took that as a show of faith from D.J. (Smith, Senators\ncoach) that I was good last game and our line did well, and I got on the board\na few times and I look forward to playing with those guys again.\"\n\n![](https://postmediaottawasun.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hockey-nhl-ott-\nvan-1-10.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640)\n\nBobby Ryan is congratulated by centre Josh Norris, who looked up to him as a\nkid, after scoring his third goal of the night. Marc DesRosiers / USA TODAY\nSports\n\nTold that Norris, a fellow American, looked up to Ryan when he was a\nyoungster, Ryan broke out in tears yet again.\n\nRyan's teammates were ecstatic at his success.\n\n> For context: Bobby Ryan returned to the ottawa senators lineup back home,\n> scored 3 goals (a hat trick) after coming back from a rehab alcoholism\n> program and being sober for 100 days.

Marc DesRosiers / USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor what remains of the 2019-20 season, the Senators are going to be in tough\nmost nights. With Jean-Gabriel Pageau gone to the New York Islanders, Tyler\nEnnis to Edmonton, Vladislav Namestnikov to Colorado and Anthony Duclair out\nwith a lower-body injury, the Senators faced the Canucks with a lineup that\nhad scored a grand total of 75 goals this season. Over on the other side, the\nfour-pack of Elias Pettersson, Miller, Toffoli and Bo Horvat had a combined\ntotal of 90 goals alone.\n\nThe challenge for Smith and company is to maintain the work ethic, to keep\npushing to improve. Norris is only up on a temporary basis, playing his second\nNHL game Thursday while replacing the injured Duclair and Colin White, but he\nreceived an opportunity Thursday to go head-to-head against the Canucks' best.\nNorris looked at home in his 17:38 of ice time, finishing his night with a\ncouple of shots on goal and a 10-4 record in the faceoff circle.\n\n![](https://postmediaottawasun.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hockey-nhl-ott-\nvan-1-7.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640)\n\nVancouver Canucks defenceman Quinn Hughes skates with the puck in front of\nOttawa Senator Connor Brown in the second period at the Canadian Tire Centre.\nMarc DesRosiers / USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"You have to continue to work hard and get better,\" Smith said of the\nchallenge during the final 16 games. \"There are a lot of guys in that room\nthat are trying out for this team next year. It's probably more valuable how\nthey play down the stretch than, say, a shortened training camp where you\nmight only get three exhibition games.\n\n\"How you play, how you train, what you are as a teammate \u2026 that's going to\ntell us a lot about guys if they want to be here next year or not.\"\n\nFor all that, Ryan provided a bonus against the Canucks, a taste of yesterday.\n\n[kwarren@postmedia.com](mailto:kwarren@postmedia.com)\n\nTwitter.com/Citizenkwarren\n\n **ALSO IN SPORTS**\n\n[WARRENSPIECE: More big minutes for Chabot, Norris relishes taste of the NHL,\nPeca picks up fan support and Borowiecki could be here to the\nend](https://ottawasun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/ottawa-senators/warrenspiece-\nmore-big-minutes-for-chabot-norris-relishes-taste-of-the-nhl-peca-picks-up-\nfan-support-and-borowiecki-could-be-here-to-the-end) **[  \n](https://ottawasun.com/author/citizenkwarren)**\n\n[After 17-year gap, 62-year-old Bryan Cochrane ready to rock again at\nBrier](https://ottawasun.com/sports/curling/after-17-year-gap-62-year-old-\nbryan-cochrane-ready-to-rock-again-at-brier)\n\n[SNAPSHOTS: The Ottawa Senators are determined to compete until the final\nbuzzer](https://ottawasun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/ottawa-senators/snapshots-the-\nottawa-senators-are-determined-to-compete-until-the-final-buzzer)\n\n**Comments** Share your thoughts\n\n  * [Bobby Ryan ](https://ottawasun.com/tag/bobby-ryan)\n  * [Thomas Chabot ](https://ottawasun.com/tag/thomas-chabot)\n\nnhl\n\nThu, Mar 26  \n---  \n| | Postponed| 1| 2| 3| Tot  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[Ottawa](http://scores.ottawasun.com/nhl/teamstats.asp?teamno=14&type=stats)|\n| | |  \n[Boston](http://scores.ottawasun.com/nhl/teamstats.asp?teamno=01&type=stats)|\n| | |  \n  \n  \n[![](https://static-\nhosted.stats.com/config/stats_logo.gif)](https://www.stats.com/)\n\n(C) STATS - 2020\n\n### Results updated hourly.

Alers is Dentons\u2019 CEO for Latin America and the Caribbean since 2014,\nhelping to position Dentons for presence, client service, and growth in the\nregion. In this interview, Jorge Alers tells us how Dentons expanded in Latin\nAmerica and the Carribean so rapidly and successfully as well as the firm's\nfuture expansions in these regions.\n\n  \n\n **In South America, you decided to open first in Mexico & Colombia in 2015,\nthen in Peru in 2017, later in Chile in 2019. Recently you announced,\ncombinations with an Argentinian firm, Rattagan Macchiavello Arocena and\nUruguay-based Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, Viana & Brause. What was the rationale\nbehind expanding in this particular order? Was it done according to the\nopportunities Dentons identified in these markets? **\n\n**Jorge Alers:** We started about three years ago both in Mexico and Colombia\nand then we continued to expand in Central America. We then started moving\nfurther into South America and the Caribbean. In all of these cases, our\nstrategy has been dictated, not because we were driven by a particular client\nbut by the opportunities presented with different local law firms. We are\nalways looking for law firms of the highest quality but also firms that share\nour values and our vision. What we have found is that the countries that are\nbest integrated into the global economy are the ones that offer the best\nopportunities for local law firms to take advantage of our platform. Our reach\ninto so many countries allows our offices throughout Latin America and the\nCaribbean to tap into opportunities around the world. So, if the local economy\nis integrated into the global economy, it just naturally follows that it\u2019ll\npresent the greatest opportunity for our offices and also for our client\u2019s\nbusinesses. Accordingly, our strategy was largely dictated by identifying the\nright firms for us. So far, we have offices in Mexico, Central America,\nColombia, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and across the Caribbean. As you\nmentioned, most recently we have announced two new whole-firm combinations in\nArgentina and Uruguay.\n\nI\u2019d also like to highlight what we have elected to do in Venezuela, where we\nwere able to identify the right fit for us. We combined with Despacho de\nAbogados miembros de Dentons. It may not seem like an obvious choice to enter\nthe Venezuelan legal market at this time, but our new colleagues share our\npassion and vision. That\u2019s why this combination was such a great fit \u2013 both\nfor them and for us. Venezuela is not going through the best times right now\nbut for us, it was important to have the most talented lawyers as part of our\nfirm.\n\n**Dentons is now present in almost every country in the Latin American and the\nCaribbean region with the exception of Paraguay, Ecuador, the Dominican\nRepublic, and Bolivia. Are these countries next on Dentons\u2019 radar for\nexpansion or are these markets too small for the firm?**\n\nNo market is too small for Dentons. We are driven to build a presence in\njurisdictions where our international clients are eager for us to have a\nphysical presence or where clients in those jurisdictions can take advantage\nof our global platform.\n\n**Are there ongoing discussions with local law firms in these markets?**\n\nWe are always looking for opportunities and actively engage in conversations\nwith local law firms in these jurisdictions. It is very important for us that\nwe follow our process. While combining with a firm, we need to make sure the\nfirm shares our values and vision. We look for a firm that wants to integrate\ninto and collaboratively work with their colleagues throughout Latin America\nand around the world at Dentons.\n\nUltimately, this process requires extensive discussions with these firms; they\nhave to get to know us and we have to get to know them. This process takes\nsome time and it\u2019s not like an M&A transaction where you identify the target,\nagree on a price, and move forward. Our focus is on building true\npartnerships.\n\nWe are looking to grow in both new and existing markets. In Brazil, for\nexample, there are lots of growth opportunities.\n\n**Some international law firms prefer to have a single LatAm headquarters or\nhave a best-friend relationship with local firms. Why is it important for\nDentons to have offices all over the continent?**\n\nWe are very proud of our polycentric model based on the notion that to offer\nthe highest quality legal service, you have to able to count on the talented\nlawyers that have \u201cin and of the community\u201d connections and knowledge to\nensure that you are not merely trying to do things in the ways they are done\nin other jurisdictions, like in New York or London. You want to make sure that\nyou are considering the nuances of each jurisdiction. Having an office in Peru\nto cover Argentina or Brazil doesn\u2019t make sense. Peruvian lawyers in Lima\nwould not have the in-depth \u201cin and out of the community\u201d knowledge and\nexperience that lawyers in Brazil or Argentina would have. Since we value and\nrespect the legal requirements and traditions of each market in which we have\nan office, we will not have any headquarters in Latin America or the\nCaribbean, just as we don\u2019t have headquarters for the global firm.\n\n**You decided to combine with Argentinian and Uruguayan firms just before\npresidential elections in those countries, which is inevitably a time of\ninstability. What was the thinking here?**\n\nOur objective is not to take advantage of the short-term opportunities in a\nparticular market, but rather to invest time in finding the most talented\nlawyers who share our vision and values. We decided to move forward with these\ncombinations, even though the immediate environment may seem less stable. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t recognize the tremendous potential in both\nArgentina and Uruguay. In Argentina and Uruguay, our conversations got to the\npoint where both sides were comfortable with each other. We were sure this was\na combination that would be successful in the longer term. We have the right\npeople in both countries, but we also recognize that in the long term the\nmarkets themselves are going to provide many opportunities to grow and provide\nthe level of service our clients require in those jurisdictions.\n\n**What was most difficult about expanding in Latin America?**\n\nClearly, in Venezuela, because of the US sanctions, we had to very carefully\nwork through a variety of issues.\n\nThat said, when we first started our project, Dentons was a relatively new law\nfirm in Latin America and the Caribbean, having established only a year and a\nhalf prior to my joining. The market understandably did not know about our\npolycentric model or our commitment to combining with firms with the most\ntalented lawyers in the respective market. So, it was something that the\nmarket had to come to understand. The market has understood that now, so it\u2019s\nbecome less difficult to interest firms in exploring a possible combination\nwith Dentons. When I travel to different jurisdictions in Latin America and\nthe Caribbean, people are interested, they want to know about Dentons and they\napproach me. This was not the case five years ago.\n\n**What is the firm\u2019s expansion vision in Brazil, given the restrictions by\nlaws governing the legal profession?**\n\nWe have a strategic alliance with Vella Pugliese Buosi e Guidoni Advogados\n(VPBG) in Brazil. Thanks to this alliance, today our clients have access to\noffices in S\u00e3o Paulo and Bras\u00edlia. In the long term for a country of the size\nand importance of Brazil, we are actively hoping to continue to grow in Brazil\n\u2013 through Vella Pugliese Buosi e Guidoni Advogados as it is also the largest\neconomy in Latin America. Strategically, it\u2019s a very important market. Our\npartners in Brazil share and are fully aligned with this vision to grow,\nconquer and prosper within Brazil.\n\nHowever, there have been challenges due to restrictions on the presence of\ninternational law firms in the Brazilian legal market. Foreign law firms are\nmostly established as international consultancies. They are intended to\nprovide non-Brazilian legal services that are modeled on those in New York and\nLondon. For us, it's essential to recognize the value and talent and allow the\nBrazilian lawyers to take advantage of the Dentons platform and then provide\nindependent support under Brazilian law that both local and international\nDentons clients are looking for.\n\nOur polycentric model is in tune with the requirements and restrictions in\nBrazil. We recognize and respect the independence of the VPBG partners in\nBrazil contrary to many other firms that are not polycentric in nature. In\nthat regard, we are uniquely positioned in the Brazilian market to provide the\nhighest-level possible service to our clients.\n\n\\- Sneha Ashtikar\n\n## Headline News\n\n[ Elegis Strengthens

FIR\nregistered\n\n[Anuja Jaiswal](/toireporter/author-Anuja-Jaiswal-479167193.cms)| TNN |\nUpdated: Sep 24, 2019, 15:37 IST\n\n![Aligarh Muslim University \\(File\nPhoto\\)](/thumb/msid-71275474,imgsize-217710,width-400,resizemode-4/71275474.jpg)Aligarh\nMuslim University (File Photo)\n\nALIGARH: Aligarh police on Monday registered a case against an [Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aligarh-Muslim-\nUniversity) ([AMU](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/aligarh-muslim-\nuniversity)) student, who allegedly abused and slapped his classmate - an\ninternational student from Jordan.  \n  \nAn FIR was registered after the varsity\u2019s proctor forwarded a complaint about\nthe incident that took place a couple of days ago.\n\n  \nAligarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Akash Kulhary said a case has\nbeen registered against three persons, Mohd Nabeel Ansari, a student of MA\n(Linguistics), his father and brother under sections 323 (voluntarily causing\nhurt), 147 (rioting), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of\nthe peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC on the basis of a complaint\nfiled by the victim, Abdel Hameed Mohd Salman.  \n  \nKulhary said that they would soon call Nabeel for questioning and further\naction will be taken after hearing his side of story.  \n  \nThe victim has also approached the Jordanian embassy and the HRD ministry in\nthis regard. In his complaint, Abdul Hameed has written that if no action is\ntaken against the accused, who had allegedly tried to kidnap him as well, his\nembassy will take up the matter with the state and the Union governments.  \n\n  \nThe complaint filed by the victim stated, \u201cMy classmate Nabeel has been\ndisturbing me since my joining the class, but I had ignored his misbehaviour\ninitially. One day, I gathered courage and asked him the reason for his\nhostile behaviour.\u201d He further stated that Nabeel asked him to come out of the\nclass and then allegedly abused and slapped him in front of the other\nstudents. \u201cI ran away from there, as I got scared and I could not sleep the\nentire night. When I told my family members about the incident, they advised\nme to go to the class and forget about the incident,\u201d the complaint added.\n\n  \n\n  \nHe said when he went for his class, the next day, Nabeel and his family\nmembers were waiting for him. He alleged that they tried to kidnap him but\nfailed. He also alleged that Nabeel threatened to kill him.\n\n  \n\n  \nChairman of linguistics department, Prof S Imtiaz Hasnain, told TOI that Abdel\nHameed had neither approached him nor filed any complaint before the\ndepartment\u2019s grievance committee. He said, \u201cNabeel came to me four days ago\nand told me that Abdel had allegedly attacked him.\u201d He said he advised him to\nfile a complaint in this regard but he refused to do so, as he did not seem\nserious about the matter. He admitted that Nabeel had sustained some injuries\non his neck during the scuffle.\n\n  \n\n  \nHe further said that Abdel has been studying in AMU for more than four years\nand is a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d student. On the other hand, he described Nabeel as\nvery quiet student. Hasnain added that he has called both students in his\noffice to inquire into the matter in detail.\n\n  \n  \n\n  * ###### Download\n\nThe Times of India [**News App**](http://get.timesofindia.com) for Latest\n[**City News**](http://get.timesofindia.com)\n\n  * ###### Subscribe\n\nStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

Police graduation tomorrow\n\n**Wednesday, 18 December 2019, 12:22 pm**  \n**Press Release:[New Zealand\nPolice](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Police)**\n\n**Sporting success to Police parade \u2013 Police graduation tomorrow**\n\nSixty new cops have completed their training for the frontline and will\ngraduate on Thursday at the Royal New Zealand Police College.\n\nConstable Dan Snee is used to lining up in front of an audience as a rugby\nplayer who has played over 30 tests for Spain; the last one was in March 2018.\n\nHis rugby skills have taken him around the world, but he\u2019ll soon be back home\nin Eastern District where he\u2019s keen to put his new policing skills to work.\n\nDan is the nephew of slain police officer Senior Constable Len Snee, who lost\nhis life 10 years ago during the Napier Siege.\n\nBoth Len and Dan played for the Hawke\u2019s Bay Magpies in the midfield; now Dan\nis wearing the blue uniform like his uncle before him because he wants to make\nhis community a safer place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I love working in team environments, and I\u2019m looking forward\nto the work/life balance that the job will bring.\u201d\n\nDan will receive the Leadership Award at the graduation ceremony.\n\nConstable Wheturangi Campbell started seriously thinking about a police career\nin 2014 when her mother, former Secretary for Justice Belinda Clark, was\npatron of a recruit wing.\n\nWheturangi has been an event planner for the past seven years, which she\ndescribes as \u201ca high intensity role with lots of quick thinking and problem\nsolving required\u201d \u2013 a good grounding for her new career.\n\nWheturangi represents Wellington in cricket, playing for the Wellington Blaze,\nand has also achieved success in football, basketball and athletics for\nWellington, so it\u2019s no surprise she will be serving the community in\nWellington District.\n\nShe says she joined Police to make a difference.\n\n\u201cI want to help those who are unable to help themselves and be part of\nsomething bigger than myself \u2013 and part of a team in doing so.\n\nI think another part of my joining the Police is due to my mum\u2019s various roles\nwhile I grew up, being exposed to the judicial system and public sector very\nearly on.\n\nThis always inspired me to get into law but I realised becoming a lawyer\nwasn\u2019t exactly for me.\n\n\u201cAs a teenager I saw a lot of lost rangatahi and knew that one day I would\nlike to be the one to help them find their own way.\n\nEven though their hate for the police was so strong I knew it wasn\u2019t warranted\nand that it had been passed down to them.\n\nI want to help change that negative perception of police and challenge those\nmisconceptions out there.\u201d\n\nFormer Silver Fern, Commonwealth Games Silver Medallist and now a police\nofficer, Constable Ellen Halpenny is finding better work stories.\n\nEllen played in the Silver Ferns Commonwealth Games squad in 2014 and has\nplayed in netball teams across the country, retiring from the Northern Stars\nearlier this year after playing in the 2019 season grand final.\n\nShe says she\u2019s joined Police because it\u2019s an organisation that works as a team\nto complete a common goal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I love doing,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn so many aspects of policing you need your colleagues on your left and\nright.\n\nPolice so far has allowed me to work with a diverse team, all while tactically\nworking together and in pressure situations.\n\n\u201cThe reward and feeling you get when achieving the common goal makes all the\nhard work worth it.\u201d\n\nEllen is posted to Bay of Plenty District.\n\nEight of the new constables have worked for police in other roles, from\nCommunications Centres to File Management Centres, which have been a great way\nto step into a constabulary career.\n\nConstable Leo Stanic, for example, was born in Croatia and moved to New\nZealand as a 4-year-old.\n\nHe gained a degree in international business and marketing, and worked as a\nfile management support officer until he was called up to train at the Police\nCollege.\n\n\u201cThis is my ideal job,\u201d says Leo, who can\u2019t wait to be out and about helping\nhis community in Wellington District.\n\nConstable Moyra van Rooyen has taken out the top prize in the wing, the\nMinister\u2019s Award.\n\nMoyra was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand with her family when\nshe was 6 years old.\n\nA family tragedy during her early years in New Zealand brought her first\nexperience of New Zealand Police.\n\nThe police officers, she says, were very supportive to her family.\n\nLater she completed a degree majoring in criminology and psychology in the\nhope of pursuing a police career, knowing it was something she wanted to be a\npart of.\n\nMoyra is posted to Northland District.\n\nCommissioner Mike Bush, other members of the Police Executive and Police\nMinister Hon Stuart Nash will also be present at the graduation ceremony on\nThursday 19 December.\n\n **Awards**\n\nMinister\u2019s Award recognising top student \u2013 Constable Moyra van Rooyen,\nNorthland District\n\nAward for second top student \u2013 Constable Joss Powell, Wellington District\n\nCommissioner\u2019s Award for Leadership \u2013 Constable Daniel Snee, Eastern District\n\nPhysical Training and Defensive Tactics Award \u2013 Constable Tyler Hemi, Tasman\nDistrict\n\nDriver Training and Road Policing Practice Award \u2013 Constable Kane Ritchie,\nCentral District\n\nFirearms Award \u2013 Constable Jimmy Lim, Wellington District\n\n **Deployment information**\n\nThe new constables will have a one-week break before starting duties in their\ndistricts.\n\nThe wing is being dispersed as follows:\n\nNorthland \u2013 2\n\nWaikato \u2013 7\n\nBay of Plenty \u2013 2\n\nEastern \u2013 6\n\nCentral \u2013 13\n\nWellington \u2013

Rationing still appears to be limiting\nthe ability of nurses and other frontline workers to access and routinely wear\nthe PPE gear they need to do their job safely. Initially at least, we were\nalso rationing the public\u2019s access to Covid-19 testing. We also continue to\npick and choose among the scientific evidence to justify advising the public\nagainst the need for them to wear masks\u2026. If it hasn\u2019t done so already, this\ntrend will end up eroding public confidence in the Ministry of Heath\nassurances that hey don\u2019t worry people, we have enough PPE gear, testing kits\nand masks to go around.

He participated in\nthe protest but was not issued a summons._\n\nActor Sam Waterston was among hundreds who protested at Yale Bowl Saturday in\na climate change action for fossil fuel divestment that drew hundreds onto the\nfield and disrupted the Yale-Harvard football game.\n\nWaterston was among a group of about 150 students and alumni from Yale and\nHarvard who planned to storm the field at halftime after the bands played.\nHundreds more joined as the protest unfolded, leading to a 40-minute delay in\nthe start of the second half.\n\nThe Academy Award-nominated actor, star of Law & Order, is a member of the\nYale class of 1962. He was arrested Oct. 18 in a climate change protest\noutside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. along with Jane Fonda, his co-\nstar in Grace and Frankie.\n\n\"We reached out to him ahead of time because he had been involved in the Green\nNew Deal protests,\" Nora Heaphy, a Yale junior and an organizer of Saturday's\nprotest, told Hearst Connecticut Media.\n\nWaterston's participation was not announced separately by the organizing\ngroups.\n\nThe actor issued a statement, which the group Fossil Free Yale, part of the\ncoalition of groups that organized the event, posted on its Facebook page.\n\n\"I'm here because I hope the students' determination, and maybe my joining in,\nwill give some heart to the great majority of us who know we are in the middle\nof a climate emergency, but are paralyzed by the size of the challenge, so\nthat we will take courage from these young people to speak up ourselves; that,\nseeing them, we'll feel a new confidence in our numbers and strength, and in\nour power to move even a mountain of inertia and resistance as big as this\none.\"\n\nHe added, \"You don't get to have the facts, the truth, and the right on your\nside every day. This is one of those days.\"\n\nHe included the\n[#NobodyWins](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nobodywins?epa=HASHTAG) hashtag\nwith his statement.\n\nHeaphy, who is from New Haven and was among those arrested, said Waterston,\n79, was eager to join the students and alumni in the core group, about two-\nthirds Yale and one-third Harvard. Waterston is believed to be the oldest\nperson arrested; all were charged with misdemeanors.\n\nThe groups, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard and the Yale Endowment Justice\nCoalition, brought five banners out onto the field with their demands: That\nYale and Harvard, with combined endowments of about $70 billion, immediately\nagree to divest their investments in companies producing and selling fossil\nfuels; and that the universities cancel the obligations underlying debt they\nhold for Puerto Rico, which remains in financial crisis.\n\nOn fossil fuel stocks, they are demanding the universities sell their\nholdings. On Puerto Rico, their demand is for the universities not to sell the\nbonds but to cancel them, thereby losing the investment. Information about the\namount of specific holdings in Yale's $29 billion endowment is not available\npublicly and Yale has not released it. The university issued a statement in\nwhich it agreed with a statement by the Ivy League, reinforcing the groups'\nright to expression but criticizing the venue as disruptive.\n\n\"We extend empathy to the people in the stands and the football team and the\nband because we know they are our allies...\" Heaphy said in response to the\nuniversity's statement. \"But when we see something like that from the people\nwho actually have power to do something, we see it as pretty negligent of them\nin ignoring what's really at stake here and not actually that reflective of\nhow people at the game really felt about the protest.\"\n\nShe added, \"It's also a time in which Yale and Harvard's sort of elite\nprivilege and power\u2026 is really, really visible, and I think in many ways that\ndeserves to be confronted.\"\n\nYale won the game in a 50-43 comeback, in double-overtime -- a momentous event\nin the annals of one of the oldest rivalries in all of sports. It ended in\nnear darkness in part because of the protest delay.\n\nThe organizers -- without hierarchy or titles -- divided about 150 students\nand alumni into nine groups of 15 to 20 people each, the better to move around\nthe stadium before the protest and watch out for one another, Heaphy said.\nThey purposely waited for the bands to complete their halftime shows, so as\nnot to mar the musicians' place in the limelight.\n\n\"We were committed and prepared to remain on the field until either Yale and\nHarvard met our demands or they arrested us.\" she said. \"Instead we were\njoined by many many people from the stands and it took much longer than\nanticipated.\"\n\nOrganizers from the two universities worked together in a series of late-night\nvideo calls, Heaphy said. \"The rivalry between Harvard and Yale reaches its\nhighest point at the game,\" she said, \"and one of the main messages of this\naction was of the Harvard and Yale students coming together to say here's what\nwe agree on, our universities cannot be complicit in the climate crisis.\"\n\nHer court date: Dec. 6. \"It's the day of the next climate strike,\" she said.\n\n[\n\n## LISTEN: Exit 43 Podcast\n\n](/podcasts)\n\n  * [ ![](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/37/35/19265358/11/core_promo.jpg) ](/local/article/Tragedies-amid-the-data-Podcast-examines-the-15182544.php)\n\n####  [PODCAST: Balancing humanity and science in a\npandemic](/local/article/Tragedies-amid-the-data-Podcast-examines-\nthe-15182544.php)\n\n[ View Comments\n](https://www.middletownpress.com/middletown/articleComments/Law-Order-s-Sam-\nWaterston-arrested-at-14859139.php)\n\n(C) 2020 Hearst Communications, Inc. ![print footer logo](/img/print-footer-\nlogo.png)\n\nLogo Return to Top\n\n### About\n\n  * [Privacy Notice](/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Your California Privacy Rights](/privacy-policy/#additionalinformationforcaliforniaresidents)\n  * [Interest Based Ads](/privacy-policy/#interestbasedads)\n  * [Terms of Use](/tos/)\n  * [Careers](http://www.hearst.com/careers)\n  * [Advertising](http://hearstmediact.com)\n\n### Contact\n\n  * [Customer Service](/feedback/)\n  * [Contact Us](/contact/)\n\n### Connect\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/middletownpress)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Middletownpress)\n  * [RSS](/rss)\n\nHearst Newspapers [\u00a9 Copyright  Hearst Media Services Connecticut,\nLLC](/copyright-notice/)\n\n"}, {"item": "Ahmed Ali Butt lands his first lead role in Nabeel Qureshi's film about body shaming -

I still remember my first day when an employee asked\n> me if I were going to work in a similar fashion as my dad. I remember\n> thinking to myself that I am not here to wear my father's shoes, but to\n> carve my own path. The high is that you have your own company and when it\n> does well, you feel proud,\" she says.\n\n##  **Being accepted as a leader**\n\nDespite the burden of expectations, Jyotsna took over the national offline\nchannel sales of Syska Mobile Accessories, which has seen a jump in growth in\nless than two years to 54 percent and a its SKU lineup increase from 16 models\nto 52 running models.\n\n  \n\n> She handles a team of 1,800 people and also manages 600 channel partners of\n> its distribution channel. The number of retailers across the country has\n> also grown exponentially from 7,000 to over 27,000, seeing tremendous\n> growth.\n\n  \n\nJyotsna's biggest challenge was to be accepted as a leader. \"The Accessories\nteam consists of 1,800 people who have been around since we started the family\nbusiness 20 years ago. My joining directly as a boss, and not to forget a\nfemale boss, had mixed responses. However, over time I gained their trust and\nestablished my own credibility.\"\n\n  \n\nShe also realised that if she had to bring in changes that she wanted to in\nthe company, she needed to meet them halfway, get out and visit the market,\nmeet channel partners, and understand the business from every angle. Over\ntime, her team realised it and the support became mutual.\n\n##  **Ushering in change**\n\nFrom an organisational point of view, and as a millennial Jyotsna wished she\ncould change many things. She began by changing the work timings of her team.\n\n  \n\n\"There are days when we still work late nights when required. However, on\nregular days my team has a strict 10am-7pm regime. I regularly conduct\nmentorship and teambuilding activities. My team is now assigned tasks to\nmentor one another and have quick bi-weekly meetings to discuss what they did\ndifferently. We also rotate roles and responsibilities in my team at our head\noffice. I have also brought in interns from colleges who are part-time\nemployees and follow a 2pm-7pm shift that helps them gain both work experience\nalongside education,\" she says.\n\n  \n\n> Being a tech-savvy person and a big fan of the cloud and artificial\n> intelligence, Jyotsna is currently working on incorporating Power BI and\n> Azure tools for MIS, sales forecasting and procurement to gain better\n> insights on data for better ROI.\n\n  \n\nBut if there is one major change Jyotsna would like to bring to the Syska\nGroup is to make it a five-day working company. \"Currently, we work on\nSaturdays and sometimes on Sundays too when it is peak or festive season. But\nthe plan is to be a Monday-to-Friday working organisation,\" she says.\n\n  \n\nOn future plans, Jyotsna quips, \"As of now, I am completely focused on this\nbaby. We want to be present everywhere and in the hands of every customer. It\nis not only about sales and growth in numbers for me, but it's always been\nabout making an impact and making a difference.\"\n\n  \n\n  \n\n ** _(Edited by Evelyn Ratnakumar)_**\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/4/8e7cc4102d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/Untitleddesign881576650334176png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)\nAlso Read\n\n### Meet the woman entrepreneur whose love for fashion made her start up in\nher 50s\n\n](https://yourstory.com/herstory/2019/12/woman-entrepreneur-fifties-fashion)\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/4/8e7cc4102d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/Untitleddesign681574845285854png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### This woman entrepreneur started up at the age of 25 with Rs 5k, clocks Rs\n1 Cr turnover in 2 years\n\n](https://yourstory.com/herstory/2019/11/woman-entrepreneur-mumbai-events-dj-\nafrojack)\n\n**How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

 * [ __Print](/article/print/936531)\n\nOne morning in October 2017, I returned from my CrossFit workout to see a\nseries of WhatsApp messages from Karthik Reddy. An ex-boss of mine at The\nTimes of India Group, Reddy had gone on to co-found seed fund Blume Ventures,\nwhich had evolved into a much-loved and well-regarded player in the Indian\nstartup ecosystem. These messages were markedly different from our usual\ndiscussions; they were about him thinking aloud about a potential role for me\nat Blume, and would, in turn, spur a meeting between us, leading to my joining\nthe firm a year later.\n\nThis is a partial narrative of my journey and experience, and partly a\nreflection on the Indian venture capital industry. I wanted to give readers a\nsense of what it is that I see from my vantage point in Blume\u2019s investment\nteam.\n\n## Not just investing\n\nMy initial conversations with Blume, especially as 2018 got underway, took\nplace against the backdrop of the company\u2019s partners working to raise its\nthird series fund. This was to be its largest fund at Rs 573 crore and they\nwere trying to onboard a bunch of newer and larger limited partners, the folks\nwho give us money to invest.\n\nI was involved with a few of those limited partners conversations, where I was\nintroduced to them as a prospective hire. I don\u2019t think I was as worried about\nmeeting the Blume partners as I was about the limited partners\u2019 meetings given\nany carryover of a poor performance from me to their Blume discussions.\n\nIndustry commentators and aspirants portraying the venture capitalist\u2019s role\nas a cushy buy-side one \u2013 listening to pitches, dispensing cash to select\nfounders and rejecting others \u2013 please note that before venture capitalists\ncan distribute cash, there is a lot of selling to be done to limited partners\nto raise those funds.\n\nWhen founders complain about fundraising, we empathise, for we know how\nstressful it is and also understand its implications. If we can\u2019t raise the\nnext fund, then we can\u2019t fund startups and are locked out of the ecosystem.\nGiven that 2% of the fund size counts towards fees, from which salaries and\nexpenses are met, the inability to raise funds can also cripple a firm\nfinancially.\n\nIn Blume\u2019s case, just as with all homegrown venture funds such as India\nQuotient, Pi Ventures, and Stellaris, the partners who invest are the ones\nhustling to raise cash as well. This is unlike some of the larger MNC funds in\nIndia who typically get a carve-out of the money raised, with a partner who\nfocuses on fundraising sitting at the headquarters. Given that Blume is\nfundraising while also investing simultaneously \u2013 the founders don\u2019t know\nabout your fundraising cycles or don\u2019t care \u2013 and also has an existing\nportfolio to worry about, this means a lot more emails, hustle and travel.\n\nThe partners bear the brunt of all this, but it spills over to the rest of the\nteam as well. Accentuating this is the huge volume of inbound early-stage\ninvestment opportunities, including idea stage pitches, a holdover from our\nmicro-venture capitalism days, which calls for a fair share of the\norganisation\u2019s time. Let us understand this in detail.\n\nWe typically get around 3,500 pitches a year. Up to a sixth of those are\nreferrals. The cold pitches get anywhere from a minute to five minutes \u2013 very\nrarely, a bit more \u2013 while the referrals get at least 15 minutes-20 minutes\nand a mail-back. Often the referrals lead to a meeting. Sometimes two.\n\nThen there are calls from journalists, hiring interviews \u2013 everyone wants to\nexplore a role in the industry; often the introductions come from senior\nfolks/limited partners, which mean at least a 30-minute call \u2013 and often\nmentoring discussions that don\u2019t have a pipeline or portfolio outcome. Add to\nthis, portfolio catchups, and you can quickly lose control of your schedule. A\nday spent in meetings is at least 60 emails-70 emails piled up. I don\u2019t think\nI have worked under 60 hours in any week since I joined Blume.\n\nThis tweet on the venture capital business by Leo Polovets, a venture\ncapitalist with Susa Ventures, was particularly interesting. The second\nobservation, I thought, was on point:\n\n> Things I didn't anticipate about VC:  \n> *feedback loops are VERY long  \n> *every meeting is energizing, but the aggregate of all meetings is draining  \n> *many experienced VCs are as clueless as newbies  \n> *rules of thumb are often incorrect overgeneralizations from small samples.  \n> cc [@mamoonha](https://twitter.com/mamoonha?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> <https://t.co/YZKQcJ1u6O>\n>\n> -- Leo Polovets (@lpolovets) [May 14,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1128435333412995072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Battling ageism\n\nAmongst the most dramatic differences between venture capital and traditional\nindustries is the time you spend with 20-somethings.\n\nI can go days without meeting anyone in their 40s. Yes, we do get pitches from\nolder founders, but the vast majority of startup founders are in their late\n20s or early 30s. This is especially true of business-to-customer startups.\n\nIt has been hugely energising to meet these fearless young founders, out to\nchange the world. You can feed off their excitement, energy, and passion.\n\nEven so, I wonder if we celebrate youth a bit too much. It isn\u2019t the\ncelebration of youth that is worrying as is the creeping subtle discrimination\nagainst older founders, especially those in their 40s.\n\nI, in my 40s, may discriminate against someone in my age group.\n\nFaced with a pitch from an older founder, I sometimes had to check myself to\nnot judge it unfavourably. There is a real reason for this, especially if the\nfounder has had a successful corporate career before starting up. The\nassumption being the person has enough money and taste for creature comforts\nto not struggle for too long.\n\nIt is actually bizarre that I, in my 40s, can end up discriminating against\nsomeone in my age group.\n\nTrue [ageism, as seen in the\nValley](http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2019/aug/24/silicon-valley-\ntechies-as-afraid-of-ageing-as-bikini-models-2023584.html), isn\u2019t here in\nIndia yet, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised when it arrives soon.\n\n## Role reversal\n\nI spoke earlier about how venture capitalists sell to limited partners in the\ncontext of Blume and other homegrown funds. However, it is not just limited\npartners to whom venture capitalists have to sell. We also sell to founders. A\nhot space with hot founders can see venture capitalists lining up to pitch to\nthem, instead of the other way.\n\nThis is especially true of successful founders starting out a second time.\nThere aren\u2019t too many of these and when you hear of a founder planning to\nstart up again, there can be a venture capitalist rush resembling a feeding\nfrenzy.\n\nRecently, I heard that a successful Indian fintech founder was approached by\nthree different venture capitalists on the day the news of his exit from his\npresent company leaked.\n\nEffectively the demand-supply gap in favour of venture capitalists versus\nfounders inverts in favour of founders as we reach the top of the founder\npyramid. There simply are more venture capitalists chasing high-quality\nfounders than the other way around. In this context then, as Reddy mentioned\nin a podcast, \u201cthe trick of the trade is actually not about you saying \u2018I know\nhow to pick well.\u2019 It is whether the best entrepreneurs want to pick you.\u201d\n\nOnce you and the entrepreneurs pick each other, the relationship quickly\nchanges. Investing is only the beginning. It is all of the working together\nover the next few years and supporting and adding value to the founder\u2019s life\nthrough mentoring, sparring on strategy, support on hiring and fundraising,\nthat really helps set the startup for growth and greatness. As this tweet puts\nit well, the venture capital business is as much customer service as finance,\nand that is just as good a lens to see this business through.\n\n> I\u2019ve been meeting a lot of MBA\u2019s lately who believe venture capital is a\n> glamorous job. I\u2019m afraid they would be disappointed if they shadowed me for\n> a day. It\u2019s a customer service job with a lot of email and you really have\n> to love working with founders!\n>\n> -- Jennifer Carolan (@jencarolan) [May 14,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/jencarolan/status/1128109168471068672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## The shifting sands\n\nMy entry into venture capitalism came at a time when the industry was going\nthrough two interesting trends:\n\n  * easy access to capital and its impact on higher valuations delayed IPOs.\n  * the entry of later-stage venture capitalists into seed-stage investing such as the Surge programme.  \n\nThe first trend, manifested in easy access to capital, is due to greater\nlimited partner and international interest in the Indian market. This is an\noutcome of not just the performance of the Indian market \u2013 exits such as\nFlipkart and other upround-creating unicorns certainly \u2013 but also its\ninevitability. After all, there is no other large market that can grow\nanywhere close to the rates the Chinese economy grew at.\n\nA fund manager for Tiger or Coatue sitting in New York or San Francisco, or\neven a limited partner, sees the world in terms of different IRRs \u2013 internal\nrates of return, the metric used to determine the attractiveness of an\ninvestment. With the recent success stories, the Indian market\u2019s IRR is\nattractive enough for limited partners to participate. This manifests in\ngreater allocation by limited partners to Indian funds, which means more money\nchasing founders and rising valuations.\n\nThe attractiveness is also seen in more direct investments by the likes of\nSteadview or Softbank in Indian companies, bumping up valuations and often\ndelaying imminent IPOs, in an attempt to extract as much of the value before\nthe startup goes public.\n\nA related explanation is the emergence of second-time founders in India over\nthe past couple of years, thanks to exits and the maturation of the Indian\nstartup ecosystem. Venture capital funds find investing in these second-time\nfounders a less risky opportunity given their track record.\n\nAccel recently launched Rebound, a programme targeting second-time founders.\nOther venture capital funds, too, have such schemes. The result of such\ncompetition has been valuation inflation for second-time founders, justifiably\nor not.\n\nThis is also a good segue into the second interesting trend underway:\n[Traditionally, later-stage investors doing seed\ninvestments](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/vcs-\nready-tools-to-plant-seeds-in-startup-ground/70866748).\n\nSurge is the strongest outward manifestation of this, but there is also\nLightspeed\u2019s Extreme Entrepreneurship Program, and other under-the-\nradar/opportunistic optionality plays from other funds.\n\nThe implications of these trends are waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe primary reason for this, in my view, is the availability of second-time\nfounder bets. The other is also the increasing availability of highly\npedigreed first-time founders or the emergence of strong signalling mechanisms\n\u2013 such as super angels on cap table and YC selections \u2013 as the Indian\necosystem matures.\n\nThe implications of these trends, and what it means for the Indian venture\ncapitalist market, are waiting to be discovered. For now, it is creating a\nvibrant, or as some say frothy private market, standing out sharply from the\nlacklustre public stock market. In fact, [this\ncontrast](https://miten.co/2019/08/17/indiacaptialcycleaug2019/) between\nprivate boom reflected in supersized startup funding announcements, and public\ngloom, manifesting in dropping auto and consumer goods sales, is particularly\nstriking.\n\nThe mood in startup land is optimistic, but there is a sense that, if the\npublic market and the larger economy doesn\u2019t pick, we may be in for some mild\nturbulence soon.\n\nThe Indian startup ecosystem is a particularly exciting place to be, and I am\ngrateful for the vantage point I occupy in the investment team at Blume.\nThrough this piece, I wanted to give the reader a sense of what it is I see\nand experience. I hope it has been useful, and if you do wish to reach out and\nask me questions, I would be happy to help.\n\n _[Sajith Pai](https://qz.com/author/sajithpai/) is Director, Blume Ventures.\n_\n\n_This article first appeared on[Quartz](https://qz.com/india/1703692/a-newly-\nminted-indian-vc-takes-an-honest-look-at-his-industry/)._\n\n_Support our journalism by[subscribing to\nScroll+](https://scroll.in/subscribe?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=scroll_article&utm_campaign=article_footer).\nWe welcome your comments at\n[letters@scroll.in](mailto:?Subject=A%20new%20Indian%20venture%20capitalist%20lifts%20the%20curtain%20on%20his%20industry&to=letters@scroll.in).\n_\n\n  * [ startup ecosystem ](//scroll.in/tag/startup-ecosystem)\n  * [ Blume Ventures ](//scroll.in/tag/Blume-Ventures)\n  * [ venture capitalist ](//scroll.in/tag/venture-capitalist)\n\n  * [ __](whatsapp://send?text=A%20new%20Indian%20venture%20capitalist%20lifts%20the%20curtain%20on%20his%20industry%0A%0Ahttps://scroll.in/article/936531/a-new-indian-venture-capitalist-lifts-the-curtain-on-his-industry)\n  * [ __](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://scroll.in/article/936531/a-new-indian-venture-capitalist-lifts-the-curtain-on-his-industry)\n  * [ __](https://twitter.com/share?text=A%20new%20Indian%20venture%20capitalist%20lifts%20the%20curtain%20on%20his%20industry&url=https%3A//scroll.in/article/936531/a-new-indian-venture-capitalist-lifts-the-curtain-on-his-industry&via=scroll_in)\n  * [ __](mailto:?Subject=A%20new%20Indian%20venture%20capitalist%20lifts%20the%20curtain%20on%20his%20industry&body=https://scroll.in/article/936531/a-new-indian-venture-capitalist-lifts-the-curtain-on-his-industry)\n  * [ __](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://scroll.in/article/936531/a-new-indian-venture-capitalist-lifts-the-curtain-on-his-industry&title=A%20new%20Indian%20venture%20capitalist%20lifts%20the%20curtain%20on%20his%20industry)\n  * [ __Print](/article/print/936531)\n\n### Trending\n\n  1.

All sales are 50% tax deductible.\n\nThe sale is being hosted by the Vassar Haiti Project. Sales directly support\nthe livelihoods of hundreds of local artists, and proceeds further benefit\nnumerous programs in Chermaitre, a mountain village in northwestern Haiti.\n\nFounded in by Andrew Meade and Lila Meade, VHP is a student-run organization\nthat has raised over $1,500,000 since 2001. Based at Vassar College in\nPoughkeepsie, New York, VHP is a unique, award-winning experiential education\nin the theory and practice of global citizenship. Student and community\nvolunteers have the opportunity to travel to Haiti, where the organization\nsponsors a school and a medical clinic in addition to its support of artists\nand artisans.\n\nSam O'Keefe, Vassar class of 2020 reflects: \"As a senior in college reflecting\non my formative experiences to date, I remark striking parallels between the\nvalues I absorbed as a member of the First Parish youth group and those that\nmy training in global citizenship with the Vassar Haiti Project have helped me\nput into practice. The immediate warmth and sense of family that my joining\nthe youth at First Parish in high school provided saw me integrate into a\ncommunity that nurtures a deep commitment to compassionate service and equity,\nelements that are at the core of VHP's eforts to foster sustainable change in\nrural Haiti.\"\n\nO'Keefe continues: \"I am grateful for the extent to which my personal and\nprofessional aspirations have been shaped by these intertwined philosophies;\nconsequently I am so excited for the prospects of VHP students and the First\nParish youth to join forces and recognize how much their groups' messages\nresonate with each other, and for the potential for the students to cultivate\nrelations that extend beyond the November art sale.\"\n\nThe organization counts on the success of its art sales and private donations\nto fund numerous life-sustaining projects, including:\n\n\u2022 Medical clinic: A three-room medical clinic has been fully operational since\nApril 2014 and is overseen by a full-time nurse and a physician, who are both\nHaitian. The clinic sees 3,000 patients a year and provides health care to the\nresidents of 40 villages.\n\n\u2022 Women's cooperative: The 35-member cooperative was formed by village women\nlooking to further support their families and the village. The women learn how\nto sew fabrics and make jewelry, both of which will be for sale. The co-op\nalso harvests, roasts, grinds, and bags of coffee that will be available.\n\n\u2022 Education: Chermaitre's primary school serves 250 children in kindergarten\nthrough sixth grade. VHP also supports a scholarship program that makes\nsecondary school education possible for around eight outstanding students a\nyear. Currently there are an additional seven students who are needing\nsponsors for a year of financial support of $80 per month or $1,000 per year.\n\n\u2022 Reforestation: Over 36,000 trees have been planted in a successful\ncommunity-based reforestation program. The program rewards participating\nfamilies with seeds for quickly growing cash and food crops such as beans and\nyams in exchange for the families agreeing to look after trees planted on\ntheir property.\n\n\u2022 Water access and purification: Thanks to a $55,000 Rotary Global Foundation\ngrant to improve water access and purification in Chermaitre, centrally\npurified water is available to the people of these mountains for the first\ntime. Fountains for water access now align the mountainous path up the trails\nto provide clean water for 500 families.\n\nThe art sale will run from Friday, Nov. 1, through Saturday, Nov. 2, in the\nchurch Vestry, located at 630 Mass. Ave., Arlington. Friday hours are 6 to 9\np.m., and Saturday hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nThe student experiences are reported through the Vassar Haiti Project blog at\nhttp://blogs.vassar.edu/haitiproject.

graduating\nuniversity. Nova Contemporary\n\nCommunity spirit, the strength of the Indonesian art scene, played an active\nrole in the success of the recent Art Jakarta 2019, Indonesia's biggest art\nfair.\n\nThe 11th edition, which featured 70 Indonesian and international art\ngalleries, concluded early this month with robust sales and high visitor\nvolume from within the region and afar. Among the guests were international\nand local collectors, art enthusiasts and art world professionals.\n\nThe wealth of talent showcased at the Jakarta Convention Center Senayan was\nmind blowing, with each exhibit a reminder of the artist's ability to express\nthemselves and challenge painting conventions. A wide array of art forms was\npresented, everything from paintings and sculptures to architecture,\nphotography and films plus the latest technology used in installations.\n\nThe Art Jakarta scene continues to go from strength to strength, with its goal\nto offer space that represents artists and their initiatives via amazingly\ndynamic artwork still the cornerstone. The event also served as a dialogue for\nglobal art scene developments that offered varied perspectives by veteran art\ncollectors, prominent artists, curators and critics from not just Indonesia\nbut the Southeast Asian region.\n\nA Thai representative at Art Jakarta, Nova Contemporary's Sutima Junko\nSucharitkul, said Jakarta is one of the strongest art markets in Asia.\n\n\"There are a lot of art collectors based in Indonesia who really have a strong\nconnection to Southeast Asia, so I thought by having Thai artists participate\nin this event it would help promote Thai artwork in this region and beyond.\n\n![](https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2019/10/02/3351274.jpg)\n\nArt Jakarta exhibition; photos from some of the prolific artists in Asia.\nYVONNE BOHWONGPRASERT\n\n\"In fact my aim is to not just promote Thai artist's work overseas but also\nbring the artwork of international artists to Thailand.\n\n\"As Jakarta has a strong, serious-minded group of art collectors, I believe\nthat by my joining this art fair, they get to experience the progress art has\nmade in Thailand. Despite the geographical proximity between Thailand and\nIndonesia, I feel there is still a lot both countries don't know about each\nother's artists. I hope to bridge that gap at art festivals such as this, by\nbringing our artwork here.\"\n\nSutima decided to bring artwork from both emerging and established Thai\nartists to showcase the current and contemporary art scene in Thailand. She\nreached this decision primarily because a quick background research on\nIndonesian art collectors made her find out about their preference for\ncolourful yet not too conceptual art.\n\nPassionate about seeing Thai artists progress, Sutima is devoted to supporting\nthem by leaving no stone unturned in the process.\n\n![](https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2019/10/02/3351279.jpg)\n\nPieces on show at the 11th edition of Art Jakarta. ART JAKARTA EXHIBITION\n\n\"I am here to support Thai artists and the Thai art scene because I feel we\nhave a lot of great artists, but their talent is very undervalued and not\nproperly promoted. That is why four year ago I started Nova. We are trying\nvery hard to promote our artists internationally by arranging residency\nprogrammes and a joint biennale. It is important for them to be offered that\nopportunity.\n\n\"I also support female artists because the art world is largely male\ndominated. I believe there is huge potential in our female artists that is yet\nto be tapped into.\"\n\nTwo Thai female artists making their debut in Jakarta were Aracha Cholitgul\nand Prae Pupityastaporn. Both artists believe the exposure received from\nparticipating in Jakarta Art will help them receive international exposure and\nbroaden their audience base.\n\n\"In such events you get one chance to impress, so I have brought artwork that\nhas great significance for me,\" said Aracha, 31. \"Work I completed right after\nI graduated from Chula university. It was a time in my life where I was\nuncertain how to go about becoming an artist. I was also on an emotional\nroller coaster ride because I found myself struggling to reach family\nexpectations of following in the footsteps of my parents and younger siblings\nwho are all in the medical profession.\n\n![](https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2019/10/02/3351284.jpg)\n\n\"The hurdles I found myself facing made it all the worse as I was seriously\ncontemplating running away to Mexico. Don't ask me why I chose Mexico, but\nback than I just felt I needed to get away from the drama unfolding in my\nlife. It was during this desperation that I created this artwork which holds a\nlot of meaning to me.\"\n\nPrae, 38, had it slightly easier as her parents did support her decision to\nbecome a painter even though they were not totally sold on whether she would\nbe able to make it a career.\n\n\"I picked my artwork titled Twin Peaks because to me it has perfect visuals\nand theme. It is my favourite work. I am inspired largely by my surroundings,\nbooks and sometimes even phrases I hear.\n\n\"My desire is for my artwork to come out as natural as possible. I prefer to\ncreate work that is open to interpretation,\" said Prae, who has an art degree\nfrom Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nPrae said the greatest challenge was obviously to make an attempt to create\npeaks that are as identical to each other as possible. \"Of course, the end\nresult is that no mater how hard you try, you just can't get it to look\nidentical.\"\n\n![](https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2019/10/02/3351289.jpg)\n\nBeing a part of Art Jakarta helped both women to grow as artists, said Aracha.\n\n\"The whole experience was interesting for me because this was the first time I\nattended an art fair and showcased my work. It was definitely a learning\ncurve. I really liked observing how the galleries installed and managed\nartworks and all the behind-the-scenes stuff. But the nicest experience was to\nmeet collectors from other countries and hearing what they had to say about my\nartwork.\"\n\nPrae added: \"Art Jakarta turned out to be a really special experience for me\nbecause I was debuting my artwork. In the past I frequented art fairs and was\nthe audience to other artists' work, but this time I was showcasing my work.\nThis helped me to observe the reaction and comments from spectators. It was\npretty nice to have the opportunity to speak with some of them.

In March, JEC World was as\nactive as ever, and immediately upon my return to the U.S. from Paris I headed\nto Detroit for the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) Annual Technical\nConference (ANTEC). In late May, I traveled to Charlotte, N.C., for the annual\nSAMPE conference and exhibition. While each event gave me the opportunity to\ncontinue my own education about composites, so much of the value of attending\nis in catching up with industry acquaintances and numerous former colleagues,\nas well as meeting new folks heretofore unknown to me. The discussions help me\nkeep up with the vibe of the industry, be that technical or commercial.\n\nSPE and the Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering  \n(\ufeffSAMPE), organizers of two of the above events, are among the oldest\nprofessional societies serving the plastics and composites industries. In\nfact, SPE celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2017, and SAMPE its 75th this\nyear in Charlotte. SPE represents a broad spectrum of plastics, and readers of\nthis magazine are probably more familiar with its Automotive Composites\nConference and Exhibition (ACCE) held in Detroit each September. This is\norganized by the Composites and Automotive Divisions of SPE. I have been on\nthe organizing committee since 2005 and served as general chair of the\nconference four times. I have also been chair of the Thermosets and Composites\nDivisions during my many years of membership, which started back in 1992 when\nI attended my first SPE event, a Thermoset Division conference in Raleigh,\nN.C. My involvement with SAMPE goes back even earlier, with my joining the\nsociety shortly after I arrived in Detroit in 1984. Believe it or not, SAMPE\nwas doing \"automotive things\" way back then! Over the years, I have been a\nsession chair several times and have presented multiple papers at SAMPE\nconferences.\n\n### Featured Content\n\n[\n![](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2020-CW/cw032020aitarch.jpeg;maxWidth=214;height=178;mode=crop)\n](/blog/post/building-bridges-with-composites) [ Building bridges with\ncomposites ](/blog/post/building-bridges-with-composites)\n\n[ ![](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2020-CW/cw-19-news-\nboeing-737-suspension.jpg;maxWidth=214;height=178;mode=crop)\n](/blog/post/beware-the-black-swan) [ The black swan events hitting the\ncomposites industry ](/blog/post/beware-the-black-swan)\n\n[ ![](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2019-CW/cw-\nblog-082619-elgrecycledcf-2-v2.jpeg;maxWidth=214;height=178;mode=crop)\n](/blog/post/sustainability-matters-now-not-just-in-the-future) [\nSustainability matters: Now, not just in the future\n](/blog/post/sustainability-matters-now-not-just-in-the-future)\n\nAs it turns out, I am not alone in SPE or SAMPE longevity or engagement. Both\nsocieties are loaded with us \"old timers,\" so it is not unusual to run into\neach other at conferences. So many of the conversations we have include\nquestions like \"Where are you working these days?\" and sentences starting with\n\"Remember back when we\u2026\". On that note, my September 2016 _CW_ column was\ntitled [\"The power of personal\nconnections.\"](https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/the-power-of-personal-\nconnections-) In it, I discussed the decline in membership in professional\nsocieties like SPE and SAMPE, and with that decline, the face-to-face\nnetworking that has enabled my success and that of my peers. This is not\nunique to our industry -- it has been happening in all fields, as younger\nengineers and scientists rely increasingly on social media and apparently do\nnot see the same value proposition in belonging to professional societies as I\ndid when I joined. At the time, I noted that this shift was not lost on the\nleadership of SPE and SAMPE, and initiatives had been put in place to attract\nthe next generation of members -- and leaders.\n\nYou know what? Those initiatives seem to be working, at least in my\nobservations. While both SPE and SAMPE have been very active in supporting\nstudents through poster sessions, bridge-building competitions and\nscholarships, getting these student members to continue as professional\nmembers has been difficult. Several years ago, SPE created the Next Generation\nAdvisory Board, which brainstorms and implements ideas intended to engage\ngraduate students and young professionals (up to age 35). A few of these\ninitiatives have included targeted social events associated with ANTEC, and\npairing students, young professionals and \"seasoned\" professionals on teams to\nconduct plastics or composites \"quiz races,\" engaging exhibitors on the show\nfloor. SPE also offers a free membership to new young professional members for\nup to two years. Similarly, SAMPE offered a targeted Leadership Development\nSeries for young professionals in Charlotte and has recently created the Young\nProfessionals Emerging Leadership Awards. SAMPE also offers a monthly payment\nplan for membership dues.\n\nAt both ANTEC and SAMPE, there were numerous presentations by young\nresearchers and engineers. Some of the most salient questions in the technical\nsessions were coming from the younger generations, asked from a base of\nfundamental understanding of composites. They are eager learners and are\nenthusiastically engaged. These young professionals are not \"encumbered by\nexperience.\" They think in green terms like sustainability and resilience and,\nas consumers, are willing to pay a premium to achieve these objectives.\nEnabling technologies like automation, simulation, digitization and big data\nare not things they have to \"get their arms around,\" having been accustomed to\nthese from the start.\n\nI'm encouraged by what I see with these rising stars. As long as we keep them\nengaged and foster their development as leaders, the future of composites is\nin good hands.\n\n  \n\n###  Resources\n\n[ ![computer](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/whitebar.png)\n![computer](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2019-CW/gettyimages-865728066.jpg;maxWidth=214)\n](/articles/find-the-latest-composites-industry-news \"computer\")\n\n[\n\n#### Find the latest composites industry news\n\n](/articles/find-the-latest-composites-industry-news)\n\n[ ![CompositesWorld\nMagazine](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/whitebar.png)\n![CompositesWorld\nMagazine](https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2019-CW/cwstack.jpg;maxWidth=214)\n](/articles/subscribe-to-compositesworld-magazine \"CompositesWorld Magazine\")\n\n[\n\n#### Subscribe to CompositesWorld Magazine\n\n](/articles/subscribe-to-compositesworld-magazine)\n\n[ ![CW Talks -

But who cares, right?\n\nFor a prime minister that desperately needs some wins, and for one that\npromised to fight, if not end, child poverty, a free hot meal a day goes a\nlong way towards that goal.\n\nFill a tummy with good healthy kai and all roads lead to Damascus. Well, not\nquite, but the roads in Dargaville, Dunedin and Dannemora will be better. That\nis if Ardern rolls this out past Rotorua and Hawke's Bay. Why wouldn't you,\nJacinda?\n\nYou need a big win, you need a project that resonates with families, and this\nis surely it. It fits the bill, you can add schools to it year on year.\nCorporates can climb aboard.\n\n**READ MORE:  \n* [Ardern announces free lunches for school kids](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115375000/free-lunches-for-school-kids-government-announces)  \n* [Let's look to Finland for universal free lunches](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/101305452/lets-look-to-finland-and-adopt-universal-free-school-lunches)  \n* [Businessman invests $450,000 in free lunches](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/112375374/auckland-businessman-invests-450000-in-free-lunches-for-taita-college-students)**\n\nThis could be your legacy. The year of the delivery could have just taken a\nsharp turn. You could name it \"KiwiLunch\". Like it?\n\nDecent healthy food makes it easier to learn, to concentrate and to be\nhealthy, therefore more of our children will succeed. And naturally we should\nsee a reduction in truancy, obesity, and more success in school leavers\npassing exams and being prepared for the outside world.\n\nOf course, I make huge leaps of judgment and even bigger leaps of faith in my\njoining of the dots, but Treasury and all other economists get away with such\nwild predictions every day.\n\nI've seen this work in America, in schools and in corporate life where lunch\nis provided. One size fits all, it's part of their culture, no-one moans, it's\nstandard and it's uniform. And the Yanks hoe it down. Yet here we angst. And\nfor good reason.\n\nI grew up being told and seeing first-hand that Mum made us lunch every day.\nThe Chesdale cheese triangles were my favourite, litebread\u200b and alfalfa\nsprouts were my pet hates, yet they continued for some time to sneak into my\nlunch box.\n\nMONIQUE FORD/STUFF\n\nTaita College, in Lower Hutt, already receives free nutritional meals every\nday.\n\nBut that was then, this is now. Thirty years ago New Zealand didn't appear to\nhave an industry of hungry kids. I can't recall it. Even the poorer kids had\nmoney for fish and chips on the top field. We thought they were flash, but\nonly in recent years did I realise they came from the state house block over\nthe school fence and were largely left to their own devices by their parents.\n\nThere was certainly no private charity like KidsCan\u200b, and no welfare state\nfeeding us lunch daily.\n\nThere was no children's commissioner, and little high-level advocacy for kids.\nIt was mum and dad and the $6-a-week per child benefit and, of course, dad had\nthe full-time job.\n\nYet fast forward 30 years and what on earth happened? We've gone nuts. We're\ncutting our own throats with how we have shaped our own communities. Those\nresponsible please stand up.\n\nYes, we've got climate change and social media and any number of apps and\ndevices that are screwing us anyway. But now we have parents who no longer\nwork, care or who are so absent due to work, life, addictions \u2013 you name it \u2013\nbut suddenly we have more than 100,000 kids every day who don't get lunch,\nbreakfast, shoes, warmth, a bed and love.\n\nSupplied\n\nDuncan Garner: \"I worked it out, and $3m would feed all the kids in those 100\npre-schools. Who would pay? The banks. All of the big banks could give\n$500,000 each from their $1 billion annual profits.\"\n\nBut is the Government the right body to be rolling this out?  I'd say KidsCan\nboss Julie Chapman is your woman for this, and way more qualified than any\ngovernment to roll this out, yet something tells me this Government treats her\nwith suspicion.\n\nChapman's KidsCan is in more than 700 schools. That's not success. That's poor\nparenting, bad choices, low wages and a cost of living that can no longer be\njustified and is out of control.\n\nAdd to all of that that 100 pre-schools are sadly on her waiting list too, and\nwe have got a problem at home. It's time for a serious chat.\n\nI worked it out, and $3 million would feed all the kids in those 100 pre-\nschools. Who would pay? The banks. All of the big banks could  give $500,000\neach from their $1 billion annual profits. How hard? Exactly.\n\nLet's go further. Feed all preschool kids and the cost is $30m. It's nothing\nreally. The price of the Pike River re-entry. Let's save a generation and feed\nthem now. Bugger it, do secondary schools too.\n\nYes, I know it's the job of parents, but some can't be saved from themselves\nso let's bite the bullet now. Ardern can call it KiwiLunch and hope it has no\nresemblance to KiwiBuild.\n\nHell, if we fork out for prisoners to have three meals a day, then surely we\ncan do it for our kids too. Ardern may have just stumbled on a brilliant\npolicy that all of us can understand.\n\nNever mind that her idea started 14 years ago with Julie Chapman and a few\nschools. Who knew that successive Labour and National governments were taking\nus to hell in a handbasket, aided and abetted by the worst parents in the\nland.\n\nI don't agree with it, but I say do it. We can't afford for our kids to fail.\nThey are already surrounded by enough of that.\n\n*** Comments are now closed on this article**\n\nStuff\n\n  * [Facebook](javascript:void 0)\n  * [Twitter](javascript:void 0)\n  * [Whats App](javascript:void 0)\n  * [Reddit](javascript:void 0)\n  * [Email](mailto:?subject=Eat%20that%20-%20there%20is%20such%20a%20thing%20as%20a%20free%20lunch%20after%20all&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuff.co.nz%2Fnational%2Feducation%2F115427917%2Feat-that--there-is-such-a-thing-as-a-free-lunch-after-all)\n\n## most popular\n\n  * [Recap: Coronavirus updates - lowest case rise, education package](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120899975)\n  * [Coronavirus: Another 50 Covid-19 cases counted, New Zealand now has 1210 cases](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120899362)\n  * [Coronavirus: German pilot's tribute flyover to thank Christchurch during Covid-19 lockdown](https://i.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/120896849)\n  * [Coronavirus: New Zealand isn't just flattening the curve.

Demystify governance and provide\nstakeholders with an in-road to understand what it is that we do, \" she said.\n\n\"Also, you look to ensure full compliance on regulations and third-party\ncontractors that may not have been complying with regulations or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\"So we have been enforcing that. For example, the audit; we inherited a full\nbacklog of audited financial statements, and we within the three years, have\nbeen able to clear up the entire backlog. We have our current audit for 2018\ncurrently being done, and I would say, this is the first time that the\nNigerian Port Authority is catching up on its audit.\n\n\"In other areas, I would speak to our contributions to the Consolidated\nRevenue Funds (CRF). When we inherited it, we had a contribution of about N18\nbillion, but we remitted N30 billion in 2017, N30 billion in 2018.\n\n\"These are clear differentials since my joining Nigerian ports. If you look at\nan N18-billion contribution to CRF, and then a N30-billion contribution, you\ncan see that there is a huge difference.\"\n\nSpeaking on the authority's row with BUA Ports and Terminal in Rivers state,\nUsman dismissed the allegation that the organisation was being targeted by the\nauthority.\n\nShe said the NPA would not be intimidated by anyone trying \"to create a sense\nof victimisation\".\n\n\"BUA is twisting the facts that our action is something deliberately targeted\nat them or trying to frustrate their business,\" she said.\n\n\"So if you have been a responsible business entity that was required to\nreconstruct a berth in 90 days and you didn\u2019t do it in 10 years, where does\nthe issue of being targeted come in?\n\n\"I find the idea of taking your non-compliance to the media domain, to\ndistract people from the fact that you\u2019re not complying, and to attribute\npersonal issues to your noncompliance sad and pathetic. And it\u2019s a desperate\nattempt by BUA to cover up their non-compliance to contractual obligations. I\nalways want to state here that, I would not be intimidated or bullied by\nanybody that thinks he can go and buy 10 pages of an advertorial in every\nnewspaper.\n\n\"And I say, if BUA wants to sustain that, they can keep doing it until the end\nof the year or forever, because the NPA would not be intimidated or bullied by\nanyone because he feels he has the capacity to mobilize media and create a\nsense of victimization, trying to make it look like you are the victim when we\nall know you are not a victim.\"\n\n### RECEIVE ALERTS FROM THECABLE\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/whatsappicon.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\nWHATSAPP [08113975334](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\nTWITTER [@thecableng](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\n_Copyright 2020 TheCable.

excluded from the updated NRC\nin Assam was found missing from the website resulting in panic among many\napplicants.\n\nAccording to officials, the data was made offline as the contract for cloud\nstorage of the NRC data with IT company WIPRO ended on October 19 last year\nand it was not renewed by Prateek Hajela, who served as the NRC state co-\nordinator till November 12. The data was found missing from December 15.\n\nReacting to the incident, MHA clarified that it was due to a technical glitch\nand the data would be restored in a few days.\n\nThe complete detail of exclusion and inclusion of bonafide Indian citizens in\nthe Assam NRC was uploaded on its official website\n''[www.nrcassam.nic.in](http://www.nrcassam.nic.in/)'' after the final list\nwas published on August 31 last year.\n\nOut of the total of 3,30,27,661 applicants, who submitted their applications\nalong with pre-March 24, 1971 documents as proof of Indian citizenship,\n3,11,21,004 persons figured in the final list. Over 19.06 lakh people were\nfound missing from the list.\n\nAfter Hajela was transferred to Madhya Pradesh as per an order of the Supreme\nCourt, the Assam government appointed Hitesh Deb Sarma in October. But Sharma\njoined the office on December 24.\n\n\"WIPRO is responsible for the cloud service which enables the public to see\nNRC on the internet. The cloud service was discontinued before my joining. I\nhave asked them to continue it again. Hopefully, it will be resumed within a\nfew days,\" Sarma said.\n\nLeader of the Opposition and Congress leader Debabrata Saikia wrote a letter\nto Register General of India calling it a mystery. \"It is a mystery as to why\nthe online data should vanish all of a sudden, especially as the appeals\nprocess has not even started due to the go-slow attitude adopted by the NRC\nauthority. There is, therefore, ample scope to suspect that the disappearance\nof online data is a mala fide act. Indeed, the deletion of data from the NRC\nwebsite at a time when the appeals process is yet is starting, is prima facie\na deliberate violation of the directive issued by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court.\nThis act also violates the rules pertaining to the NRC, which stipulates\nvarious processes post-publication of the NRC,\" Saikia said.\n\nThe disappearance of the NRC data left many applicants worried. \"I am really\nscared as the government is making flip flop regarding the NRC. As the\ngovernment is claiming that many people submitted fake documents to get into\nthe final list, it may now remove names of those, whom it considered as\nineligible,\" said an applicant.\n\n[**Deccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to\nsubscribe**](https://t.me/DeccanHeraldNews)\n\n![](/sites/dh/files/article_images/article-optin-new-icon.png) DH Newsletter\n[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) Get top news in your inbox daily\n\nGET IT ![](/sites/dh/files/article_images/newsletter-arrow-new.png)\n\n[Assam](/tag/assam)\n\n[NRC](/tag/nrc)\n\n[Madhya Pradesh](/tag/madhya-pradesh)\n\n[Supreme Court](/tag/supreme-court)\n\n0 Comments (+)\n\n###  Related stories\n\n[ ![FIR against MP Cong MLA Kushwaha for violating\nlockdown](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/siddharth-1586339176.jpg?itok=lgKI19ey)\n\n####  FIR against MP Cong MLA Kushwaha for violating lockdown...\n\n](/national/north-and-central/fir-against-mp-cong-mla-kushwaha-for-violating-\nlockdown-822830.html)\n\n[ ![SC asks Govt to consider free COVID-19 test at pvt\nlabs](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/SC-1582412402-1586340303.jpg?itok=Bwb6kuMl)\n\n####  SC asks Govt to consider free COVID-19 test at...\n\n](/national/supreme-court-asks-govt-to-consider-free-test-for-coronavirus-at-\nprivate-labs-822823.html)\n\n[ ![Hidden Tablighi event attendees will face action: MP\nCM](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/file79whet9ge3scvg937rv-1586337767.jpg?itok=k8Uz6fsC)\n\n####  Hidden Tablighi event attendees will face action: MP CM...\n\n](/national/north-and-central/tablighi-event-attendees-who-are-hiding-will-\nface-action-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-822822.html)\n\n[ ![Docs, health workers have to be protected: SC to\ngovt](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/ahmedabad%20docs-1586337445.jpg?itok=kqTu-\nDZU)\n\n####  Docs, health workers have to be protected: SC to...\n\n](/national/doctors-healthcare-workers-are-warriors-have-to-be-protected-sc-\ntells-centre-822819.html)\n\n[ ![Bhima Koregaon: Activists seek time to\nsurrender](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/Sc-1586337218.jpg?itok=3rMWshZc)\n\n####  Bhima Koregaon: Activists seek time to surrender\n\n](/national/bhima-koregaon-activists-seek-time-from-sc-to-surrender-for-jail-\nterm-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-822817.html)\n\n[ !['Going to prison amidst COVID-19 like death\nsentence'](/sites/dh/files/styles/smallvertical/public/article_images/2020/04/08/Supreme%20Court-1586336621.jpg?itok=DA03k5Jn)\n\n####  'Going to prison amidst COVID-19 like death sentence'...\n\n](/national/north-and-central/going-to-prison-in-time-of-covid-19-like-death-\nsentence-activists-tells-supreme-court-822811.html)\n\n###  What's Brewing\n\n[\n\nCoronavirus prevents play at Motera cricket stadium\n\n](/sports/cricket/yet-to-see-ball-bowled-as-covid-19-prevents-play-at-donald-\ntrump-opened-worlds-biggest-cricket-stadium-822735.html) [\n\nMumbai set to extend coronavirus lockdown: Sources\n\n](/national/west/indias-financial-hub-mumbai-set-to-extend-coronavirus-\nlockdown-sources-822810.html) [\n\nReliance launches COVID-19 protection insurance cover\n\n](/business/business-news/reliance-general-insurance-launches-\ncovid-19-protection-insurance-cover-822816.html) [\n\nSC asks Govt to consider free COVID-19 test at pvt labs\n\n](/national/supreme-court-asks-govt-to-consider-free-test-for-coronavirus-at-\nprivate-labs-822823.html)\n\n\n\n### DH Picks\n\n  * [\n\n####  COVID-19: Indian Railways FY20 earnings dip Rs 2,129cr...\n\n](/business/covid-19-effect-indian-railways-misses-freight-loading-target-\nby-15-million-tonnes-earnings-dip-by-rs-2129-crore-822849.html)\n\n  * [\n\n####  Coronavirus news live updates: The situation in the country is...

This niche segment is the primary aspect of business tourism and\nis associated with business travellers which has witnessed a positive growth\nin the last two decades. This can be attributed mainly to the boom of the\ncorporate industry in the country and Bangalore, being the multinational IT\nhub, has abundant potential to prosper in this field. Being a completely\nbusiness driven market and Whitefield as a subset of this market has its own\ndynamics, which is quite flexible at the moment. With a robust inflow of both\ntourists and business travellers to the city, we expect Sheraton Grand\nBengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention Centre to be a game changer within the\nexisting hospitality market.\n\nAs a MICE hotel, this segment witnesses exponential growth and contributes\nsignificantly to our hospitality portfolio. I believe, the combination of a\n5-star hotel adjacent to the large convention center makes us the colossal and\nideal MICE space in the city, be it large corporate events, elaborate weddings\nor exuberant parties. We have observed that a majority segment of our guests\nare from the corporate and IT industry, driven by the growth of corporate\nsector. While being proactive to the needs of MICE travelers, the property is\nalso agile and flexible in both services and facilities. We constantly add and\nupdate our curated event packages depending on the guest\u2019s requirements. We\nhave everything planned out for a flawless execution with a touch of the\nsignature Sheraton style hospitality. In the recent past we have had the\nprivilege of hosting multiple events and conferences on a large scale such as\nthe Heart for the City, the Automation Anywhere, SAP FKOM SKOM Conference,\nSEMRUSH event and many more.\n\nSheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention Centre, located amidst\na corporate market, is the only hotel in South India which includes a hi-tech\nstate of the art convention center which can seat up to 2200+ people. This\nmakes it the largest hotel in terms of offering a combined meeting space of\nmore than 65,000 sq ft. We are also well-equipped with comprehensive audio-\nvisual technology, an in-built stage, custom catering and a team of expert\nevent planners to support the latest MICE requirements and demands. These\nfacilities have enabled us to organize several events on a large-scale that\nwould not have otherwise been possible in the city. Situated in the vicinity\nof some of the corporate giants, makes us an apt choice for guests travelling\nto Bangalore for work purposes.\n\nIn addition, we are constantly in the process of enhancing our facilities and\nensuring that they match global standards, which gives us an edge over our\ncompetitors. The hotel is equipped with an inventory of 360 rooms and 5 food\nand beverage outlet to accommodate a large number of guests who come to attend\nmeetings and conferences that are usually spread over 2-3 days. The Lobby\nLounge offers an effortless environment for interesting conversations over\nbite-size sandwiches, desserts, coffees and more.We also have 12 break-out\nvenues that can accommodate large conferences and at the same time host\nsmaller seminars with specific requirements. The drive way access, providing\nseparate parking spaces for guests attending the event and exhibitions and\nairport assistance to escort guests during arrival - departure are few ways in\nwhich we try to enhance the experiences of our MICE travelers.\n\nThus, the property in its almost 2 years of operations has contributed to\nposition Bangalore on the global MICE map for its excellent service and\nexecution. Our hotel has been recognized globally in various prestigious\nplatforms for which I am extremely proud of many of our achievements. I\nconsider bringing the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention\nCenter to the second rank on Trip Advisor, as one of my greatest achievements\nfor the property so far. We have also won other esteemed awards, including the\n\u2018Best Convention Center Hotel of the Year\u2019 by Food Food Awards 2019, \u2018Best\nWedding and MICE Hotel\u2019 by India Travel Awards South 2019 and \u2018Best 5 Star\nConvention Hotel of the Year\u2019 by Stars of the Industry Award.\n\nMy journey with the property since my joining in 2016, has been nothing short\nbut amazing.\n\n

I was\nlying in bed pondering why I felt so very peaceful and calm, when the\nlightbulb moment struck. I have to confess that in view of what is going on in\nthe world I, like many others I guess, have been feeling pretty stressed\nrecently. Climate change, knife crime, terrorism, stories of gloom and doom\nregularly making headline news means that anxiety and confusion often fill my\nmind. So, what had happened the previous day to make me see things\ndifferently?\n\nI\u2019d been at the Extinction Rebellion protest in London and had met up with a\nhuge crowd of energetic, inspiring, caring people who are prepared to give\ntime and risk arrest for a cause in which they deeply believe.\n\nA round up of the essential Positive News stories in your inbox each week\n[Sign up for our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/c-1Dcz)\n\nMy joining my local group of rebels came about because I believe that climate\nchange is a real threat not only to the distant future but to life on Earth in\nthe here and now. And because I believe financial interests are stopping the\ngovernment from taking the action which we so desperately need.\n\nBefore my trip to Oxford Circus I was invited to a workshop where I was given\nlots of helpful information about our legal rights, how we should behave (non-\nviolently) and what would happen if we got arrested. Most helpful were the\nphone numbers of solicitors who specialise in protest law. Role play helped us\nto prepare for how to deal with angry people \u2013 motorists and those angry that\nthey had been stopped from getting to work or going shopping.\n\nMy day with XR in London turned out to be everything I expected: well-informed\npeople spreading the word and encouraging each other. People handing out free\nfood and drinks and passing around sun lotion. There was lots of singing and\nclapping. Yoga and first aid tents. Inspirational speakers. Chatting with\nstrangers who I immediately \u2018clicked\u2019 with. The chanting of \u201cWe love you\u201d and\nthe shouting support when an arrest was made. The day was fun, orderly and\ninspirational. Emma Thompson described it as an \u201cisland of sanity\u201d and how\nright she was.\n\nThe organisers have made it clear that this is just the beginning. We are now\nwaiting for the government to respond to our\n[demands](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/demands/) and if the demands are\nnot met, there are lots more very carefully organised and orchestrated non-\nviolent disruptive events in the pipeline.\n\n![](https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Eileen-\nJuly-2018-A-1500x0-c-default.jpg)\n\nPositive News reader Eileen Peck took part in the recent Extinction Rebellion\nprotests in London. Image: Eileen Peck\n\nSo, why did my day with the \u2018rebels\u2019 bring me such cheer? Why did my middle of\nthe night flash of insight feel potentially life-changing? Life-enhancing?\n\nI\u2019ve come to see our regular exposure to bad news as a way of dampening down\nour joie de vivre. It produces fear, which can make us feel powerless, so we\nperhaps feel inclined to pull up the drawbridge and look after number one.\n\nIn my days as a sociology student, I was introduced to the idea of \u2018hegemony\u2019\nwhich describes the largely unquestioned world view taken in by a population.\nThe British sociologist Anthony Giddens described ideological hegemony as\n\u201cshared ideas or beliefs which serve to justify the interests of dominant\ngroups\u201d.\n\nThe term hegemony is thought to have been coined by the Italian Marxist\nAntonio Gramsci in the 1920s. He used the term to describe how, in a\ndemocracy, the domination of one group over others can be achieved by\npolitical power, which depends on the population taking on certain values and\nideas. His message was that what comes to pass does so, not so much because a\nfew people want it to happen, but because the mass of citizens abdicate their\nresponsibility and let things be.\n\nI\u2019ve come to see our regular exposure to bad news as a way of dampening down\nour joie de vivre. It produces fear, which can make us feel powerless\n\nI\u2019ve come to see that by focusing almost exclusively on the bad news, our\nmainstream media drip feeds us daily the idea that the world is a terrible,\ndangerous, place and that central to 21st century-life are competition,\nexcessive material consumption and each man for himself.\n\nBut this obscures the fact that:\n\n  * Plenty of people are working hard to help others\n  * Co-operation is on the rise, with local shops, pubs and even failing companies being taken over by local people\n  * The idea of a \u2018good life\u2019 of depending on excessive material consumption is being challenged\n  * Random acts of kindness and selflessness are on the increase\n  * And so much more\n\nMy lightbulb moment showed me that \u2013 as the ancient Greek Stoics said 2,000\nyears ago \u2013 I need to \u2018guard my thoughts\u2019 and look for the good stuff in the\nworld. The climate change protestors are a highly visible, wonderful, example\nof people rebelling. But, each time Positive News magazine pops through my\nletterbox I\u2019m helped to see that, all over the world, people in their everyday\nlives are rebelling and finding peace and happiness in a way of life which\nnurtures both the planet and each other.\n\nMy lightbulb moment showed me that I need to \u2018guard my thoughts\u2019 and look for\nthe good stuff in the world\n\nI take great comfort from the words of the US historian and activist Howard\nZinn who said: \u201cRevolutionary change does not come as one cataclysmic moment\n(beware such moments!) but as an endless succession of surprises, moving\nzigzag towards a more decent society.\u2019\u201d\n\n## \u2018The planet's fire alarm\u2019: Extinction Rebellion in photos\n\n[

Murray: \u2018You have got to think about people who aren\u2019t voting Labour\nthat voted leave.\u2019 Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\nLabour must avoid taking sides in the Brexit \u201cculture war\u201d if [Jeremy\nCorbyn](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn) is to win the\nupcoming general election, one of his key advisers has warned.\n\nAndrew Murray is the chief of staff of the Unite union and worked closely with\nCorbyn in the Stop the War coalition. He has been seconded to the Labour\nleader\u2019s office part-time and is closely involved in conversations about a\nseries of issues, including [Brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-\nreferendum).\n\nIn a rare interview, with [a general election looming after\n](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/downing-street-signals-\ncompromise-on-potential-general-election-date)[Corbyn declared on Tuesday that\nLabour\u2019s conditions for an early vote had been\nmet](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/downing-street-signals-\ncompromise-on-potential-general-election-date), he warned that the campaign to\nstop Brexit had increasingly become a form of identity politics, with\nremainers and leavers pitted against each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s had aspects of it from the beginning, and now the culture war aspect of\nit is very, very powerful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf [Labour](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour) becomes one side of\nthe culture war \u2013 the side that is, stereotyping, the liberal side \u2013 that\nwould be very damaging to the present project, and would have no basis in\nsocial justice.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit policy has shifted over the past 12 months. The party now\nadvocates negotiating a softer deal within three months of coming to power \u2013\nand then putting it to the public in a referendum.\n\n[Many Labour members and\nMPs](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/nick-brown-joins-senior-\nlabour-figures-vowing-back-remain), not least the shadow Brexit secretary,\nKeir Starmer, and shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, would like their\nparty to go further, and embrace an all-out remain position. But Murray\ninsisted that that would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cMost of the Labour party membership is remain, with varying degrees of\nintensity. About two-thirds of the 2017 Labour vote was remain. But that vote,\nas I keep reminding people, isn\u2019t big enough. The Labour vote as it stands\nneeds to be larger \u2013 you have got to think about people who aren\u2019t voting\nLabour that voted leave.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTo go from speculation to fact, we actually lost six seats at the\nlast general election. Only six, but had we held them, Theresa May\u2019s deal with\nthe DUP may not have stacked up. And they were all the leave-voting areas.\u201d\n\nThose six lost seats included Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East\nCleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South, while in many remain seats, such as\nNorwich South and Bristol West, Labour MPs saw their majorities increase\nsignificantly in 2017.\n\nMurray voted leave himself, he admits \u2013 and was disappointed that progressive\nvoices were absent from the Brexit campaign.\n\n\u201cI personally voted leave, but the leave campaign unfortunately gives no\nwarrant for a\n[Lexit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/06/labour-left-\nlexit-dead-members-leftwing-brexit) position, because it was dominated by this\nalliance of xenophobic nationalists and Thatcherite utopians. And they set the\ntone.\u201d\n\nTogether with his old friend the senior Corbyn aide Seumas Milne, the recently\nsidelined chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the\n[Unite](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/unite) general secretary, Len\nMcCluskey, Murray is part of a group branded the \u201cfour Ms\u201d, regarded by remain\ncampaigners as a block on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a referendum.\n\nAsked if he thinks of himself as part of a shadowy cabal manipulating the\nLabour leader, Murray said: \u201cI think \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m not maligning him \u2013 that\nwas an invention of Alastair Campbell, because he\u2019s still got the old magic.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t take that seriously. For one thing, none of the four Ms\nare elected politicians, and in the end it\u2019s elected politicians who are going\nto decide these things. And Jeremy has advisers who don\u2019t begin with M who\nhave as much influence as those that do.\u201d\n\nBut he is unrepentant about the influence of his union. \u201cUnite has influence,\nand it should have influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate, and\nit has been rock solid in supporting JC from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nMurray has just published a book, The Fall and Rise of the British Left,\nplacing Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour in a historic context.\n\nHis influence alarms many centrist Labour MPs. Murray \u2013 a longtime member of\nthe Communist party, who has in the past expressed [solidarity with North\nKorea](https://web.archive.org/web/20031210230502/http:/www.communist-\nparty.org.uk/articles/2003/march/10-03-03.shtml) and praised aspects of\nStalin\u2019s legacy \u2013 only joined Labour in 2016.\n\nSome also balk at the juxtaposition between his comfortable background (his\ngrandfather was the governor of Madras, and he attended a minor public school)\nand the class struggle he espouses.\n\nBut he insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour in a general election \u2013 never voted\nanything else. My joining Labour was largely motivated by the wishes of my\nunion: that as its chief of staff I be in a place to help advance its\npolitical strategy, which requires being a member of the Labour party. And\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s election removed any remaining doubts.\u201d\n\nHe has some reservations, however, about some of the radical policies bubbling\nup from Labour\u2019s grassroots. Plans passed at the party\u2019s conference last month\nincluded \u201cintegrating\u201d public schools into the state system ([under the slogan\n#AbolishEton](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-\nlabour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges)), and\nimplementing eye-wateringly ambitious [carbon reduction\ntargets](https://www.labourgnd.uk/agreed-conference-motion).\n\nMurray sees little need for policy to \u201crush far ahead\u201d of the 2017 manifesto.\n\nEven once passed by the party\u2019s conference, policy motions are only included\nin the manifesto if agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes members of\nthe national executive committee, the shadow cabinet and representatives of\nthe trade unions.\n\n\u201cI think the 2017 manifesto \u2013 which I had no direct part in writing \u2013 was\nextremely well-judged and successful. And I\u2019d imagine when the clause V\nmeeting convenes, that politicians and others there would want to look at good\nreasons why you would be doing something very different,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Labour\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which Murray missed, because he was recovering\nfrom heart surgery \u2013 the chat in the bars and cafes was about who could\nreplace Corbyn if, as even some of his staunchest supporters fear, Labour\nloses another general election.\n\nBut he is convinced that such an outcome would not mean a return to the\npolitics of New Labour. \u201cCorbynism\u2019s critics haven\u2019t really articulated an\nattractive alternative. And I think politics as usual \u2013 or politics as was\nusual from the mid-1980s until 2008, or maybe a bit later, because politics\ntakes a while to catch up with economics \u2013 is not coming back anywhere in the\nworld that I can see. And the main question is whether it\u2019s going to be a\nnasty authoritarian right wing that benefits, or radical progressive movements\nlike the Labour party has become.\u201d\n\nTopics\n\n  * [

Our\nscoring has been pretty consistent and when we disagree, we disagree \u2013 but we\nall really get along.\"\n\n![dancing_on_ice_perri](https://keyassets-p2.timeincuk.net/wp/prod/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/42/2016/05/wotv-placeholder.png)\n\nDiversity dancer Perri has been wowing us with his skills on the ice\u2026\n\n### How would you rate the standard of the performances this series?\n\n\"The skating this series has been incredible. Who knew that someone like Perri\nKiely from Diversity was just going to skyrocket after the very first show?\nAlso, magician Ben Hanlin, who was OK at the beginning, but was then pretty\nmuch right up there with Perri with his skating and tricks. Joe Swash\nsurprised us every week and let\u2019s not forget Libby Clegg. Chris and Jayne\nloved her lines, loved her power and we must remember she\u2019s blind!\"\n\n  * \n\n![dancing_on_ice_libby](https://keyassets-p2.timeincuk.net/wp/prod/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/42/2016/05/wotv-placeholder.png)\n\nJohn has been blown away by what Paralympian Libby has achieved in the\ncompetition\u2026\n\n### What have been your most memorable moments?\n\n\"One of the funniest things was Ben doing Morris dancing on the ice. That poor\nguy. No disrespect to Morris dancers but, if that were me, I would have put up\na fight and said: \u2018No way!\u2019 Also, H and Matt\u2019s first skate was very emotional\nbecause it was something we\u2019d never seen on TV before. Dancing on Ice took the\nleap in having a same-sex partnership and I'm sure, with every series from now\non, they\u2019ll want to represent the people at home watching. It was amazing.\"\n\n### So, what are your expectations for the final?\n\n\"I want all the skaters to just go out there and be fearless. I want them to\nexecute everything they've learned and show us content, personality,\ncharacterisation and musicality. We also want them to surprise us. We'll give\nour opinions on the performances but, ultimately, it's the viewers who\u2019ll make\nthe decision. The winner is gonna have to do something jaw-dropping!\"\n\n![Joe Swash Dancing on Ice](https://keyassets-p2.timeincuk.net/wp/prod/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/42/2016/05/wotv-placeholder.png)\n\nCheeky Joe has bought the fun factor to this series of Dancing on Ice\u2026\n\n### You competed on Dancing on Ice in 2006.

Blais (from left), John Fraser, Lucille Collard and Amanda Simard, all\narea Liberal MPPs, celebrate the election wins of Blais and Collard at the\nCrate & Crust Restaurant on Olgilvie Road as by-elections were held in Ottawa-\nVanier and Ottawa-Orl\u00e9ans. Wayne Cuddington / Postmedia\n\n## Lucille Collard and Stephen Blais cruised to victory in the neighbouring\nridings on Thursday.\n\nThe Ontario Liberals received two electoral shots in the arm on Thursday as\nStephen Blais and Lucille Collard easily won byelections to retain long-held\nseats for the party in the neighbouring Ottawa-Orleans and Ottawa-Vanier\nridings.\n\nThose victories increased the Liberals' allotment of seats in the Legislature\nto eight among 124 overall.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative government of Premier Doug Ford still holds a\nsolid majority with 73 seats. The NDP, led by Andrea Horwath, has official\nOpposition status with 40. There are also one Green MPP, party leader Mike\nSchreiner in Guelph riding, and two independents.\n\n\"There's a lot of work ahead, of course. We've got the convention to elect a\nnew leader, so that will be important work,\" Collard said. \"After that, we'll\nbe continuing the construction of our party. We need to bring in more people,\nwe need to have many, many, many more conversations with all the residents of\nOntario. We're going to rebuild the party that's going to be very strong, that\npeople can identify with, so I'm very confident that the Liberal party is in\nno way at its end, that it's regaining momentum.\"\n\nMomentum was on the two Liberals' side almost as soon as the polls officially\nclosed on Thursday night. Within 20 minutes and with just a half-dozen polls\nreporting, both Collard and Blais had substantial leads over their closest\ncompetitors: Myriam Djilane of the NDP and Natalie Montgomery of the\nConservatives, respectively.\n\n\"I think you have to talk to some families in Orleans to decide or to\nunderstand what motivated their vote,\" said Blais, who has served as city\ncouncillor in Cumberland ward for the past decade and before that as a school\nboard trustee.\n\n\"We worked very hard for six months, talking to residents about what was\nimportant to them, and obviously I've been working very hard for 15 years,\ndelivering real results for residents in Orleans, from education to\ninfrastructure and services. I think it's a combination of our positive\nmessage both as a party and locally in Orleans.\"\n\nThe vacancies being filled Thursday resulted from the resignations of\nincumbent Liberals Natalie Des Rosiers in Ottawa-Vanier and Marie-France\nLalonde in Ottawa-Orleans. Des Rosiers became the principal of Massey College\nin Toronto, while Lalonde won election to the House of Commons in Orleans\nriding in the 2019 federal election.\n\nOttawa-Vanier had been solidly Liberal for more than half a century, the only\nbreak in that streak being a 12-vote victory by Conservative Jules Morin over\nLiberal Horace Racine in 1967 in what was then called Ottawa East.\n\nThursday's balloting was the third in a span of four years for voters in the\nriding. Des Rosiers first claimed her seat in the Legislature in a 2016\nbyelection resulting from the retirement of former MPP Madeleine Meilleur, and\nshe held the riding in the 2018 general election by a margin of more than\n6,000 votes over the NDP's Lyra Evans.\n\n\"Look at the last election. How many of our colleagues were in 'safe' seats\nthat aren't there now? So winning elections is about earning people's trust\nand then working hard all the way through election day, like today, on a day\nlike today,\" interim Liberal leader John Fraser said.\n\n\"Take a look at the results. The results are some of our strongest in the\nridings. I think it's fair to say the message to Doug Ford is, 'Your\npriorities are not the priorities of Ontario's families. They don't want\nlarger class sizes, they don't want new licence plates, they don't want less\nsupport for vulnerable elders, they don't want buck-a-beer. They just want\ngood schools, good hospitals, a plan for the environment, a plan for jobs so\nthey can have a job and their kids can have jobs.\"\n\nWith all but a couple of polls reporting, Collard had more than 10,000 votes\non her side, in excess of 50 per cent of those ballots cast. Djilane had about\n5,000 votes, or 25 per cent, while PC candidate Patrick Mayangi trailed well\nbehind in third place with 2,300 votes, or about 11 per cent of the total.\n\nAlso running in Ottawa-Vanier in this byelection were: Benjamin Koczwarski,\nGreen party; Ken Lewis, Libertarian; J. Justin O'Donnell, Alliance: Above\nZnoneofthe (formerly Sheldon Bergson), None of the Above Direct Democracy\nparty; and independent Julie Fiala.\n\nThe win by Blais was the fifth in a row for the Liberals in Ottawa-Orleans,\nbut the margin of of victory was up substantial. In 2018, Lalonde prevailed\nwith 39 per cent of the votes to 35 for PC Cameron Montgomery.\n\nThis time Blais collected more than 14,000 votes (55 per cent), with Natalie\nMontgomery a distant second at 5,800 (23 per cent).\n\nManon Parrot finished third for the NDP with 15 per cent, followed by the\nGreens' Andrew West. Also running were Libertarian Jean-Serge Brisson,\nAlliance's Gerrie Huenemoerder, Pauper Party's John Turmel and Keegan Bennett\nfor None of the Above Direct Democracy Party.\n\nTurnout for a byelection is generally lower than it is for a general election,\nand both ridings stuck to that trend Thursday, when snowy, sloppy weather\nconditions might have been a factor: Ottawa-Orleans at 23 per cent of\nregistered voters and Ottawa-Vanier at 20.\n\nIn Ottawa-Orleans, the turnout was 62.77 per cent in the 2018 Ontario\nelection, and it was in the 60 per cent range for five of six previous\nelections since 1999.\n\nIn Ottawa-Vanier, 51.47 per cent of registered voters cast ballots in 2018,\nand the turnout was 37.37 per cent the 2016 byelection that took Des Rosiers\nto the Legislature for the first time.\n\n[gholder@postmedia.com](mailto:gholder@postmedia.com)\n\n[Twitter.com/HolderGord](https://twitter.com/HolderGord)\n\n\n\n **ALSO IN THE NEWS**\n\n[\u2018We are in an information-deprived environment,\u2019 prof on coronavirus panel\nsays](https://ottawacitizen.com/health/coronavirus-social-media-and-human-\nrights)\n\n[Snowmageddon or slushocalypse?

19, 2019, 1:43 pm IST\n\nIt has been 12 days since he landed in Varanasi to take charge of his duties,\nbut has not taken a single class yet.\n\n![Khan is distraught by protests, yet is hopeful that

is hopeful that the situation would\nchange and his students would come around soon. (Photo: Facebook)\n\n**Varanasi** : Firoze Khan, 28, who is from Jaipur district in Rajasthan, was\nexcited to take up his new job as an assistant Sanskrit professor at Uttar\nPradesh\u2019s Banaras Hindu University.\n\nIt has been 12 days since he landed in Varanasi on November 7 to take charge\nof his duties as a professor, but has not taken a single class yet.\n\n\"All my life, I learnt Sanskrit and I was never made to realise I am a Muslim,\nbut now when I am trying to teach, suddenly it has become the only subject.\"\nFiroze Khan told _The Indian Express_.\n\nKhan is a doctorate in Sanskrit and was welcomed to his new workplace amid\nprotests and anti-appointment chants.\n\n\u201cI remember the students had gathered when I arrived at BHU on November 7 for\nmy joining, but they did not say anything to me,\u201d Khan, who invited glares\nfrom protesting students, was quoted as saying to _The Quint_.\n\nA section of the BHU's students has been protesting to Khan's appointment, for\nthe only reason that he is a Muslim.\n\nAccording to the students, Khan's appointment goes against the inscription on\na foundation stone laid down by the BHU founder Madan Mohan Malviya in the\ndepartment, which read that Hindus and followers of Jainism, Buddhism and the\nArya Samaj, were only allowed entry into it, _The Hindu_ reported.\n\nThe protests were led by the RSS students' wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi\nParishad (ABVP).\n\nOn Monday, a 'hawan kund' was set up and around 20 Sanskrit Vidya Dharma\nVijnan (SVDV), a faculty of BHU, students staged a sit-in outside the BHU vice\nchancellor's office to protest his appointment.\n\nKhan is distraught by protests, yet is hopeful that the situation would change\nand his students would come around soon.\n\n\u201cI started learning Sanskrit since Class 2, but no one ever pointed this out\neven though my mohalla in Bagru (30 km from Jaipur) had 30 per cent Muslims.\nNeither the local maulavi nor society. In fact, I don\u2019t know as much Quran as\nI know Sanskrit literature. Prominent Hindus in my area praised me for my\nknowledge of Sanskrit and its literature despite being a Muslim,\u201d Khan told\n_The Indian Express._\n\nHe completed his Shastri (Bachelor degree), Shiksha Shastri (B.Ed), Acharya\n(post-graduate) and received his Ph.D in 2018 from Rashtriya Sanskrit\nSansthan, a deemed university, in Jaipur. Khan has also cleared NET and JRF.\nHis father Ramzan Khan too is a graduate in Sanskrit.\n\nKrishna Kumar, a research student at SVDV, who is one of the prime protester\nsaid: \u201cIf a person is not connected with our feelings and culture, how will he\nbe able to understand us and our dharma''.\n\nThe BHU administration on Friday backed the appointment of a Muslim professor,\nsaying it is committed to provide equal opportunities to everyone irrespective\nof religion, caste, community or gender. However, it seems that\nadministrations' words were not strong enough to compel students to accept the\nMuslim professor.\n\nKhan, however, has been undertaking efforts to explain to students that\nteaching has nothing to do with religion.\n\n\u201cTo students who are protesting with an argument that how can I teach Hinduism\nwhen I am a Muslim, I want to say that in Sahitya department, we have to study\nabout the technicalities of Sanskrit literature and famous dramas like\nAbhigyan Shakuntalam, Uttar Ramcharitam or Mahakavya like Raghuvansh Mahakavya\nor Harshcharitam and all this has nothing to do with religion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point I can agree that if I have to teach Vedas, Dharam Shastra or\nJyotish then its better I am a Hindu but teaching Sanskrit Sahitya has nothing\nto do with it. All I have to teach what is written over there,\u201d he added.\n\nStudents from some other departments and other faculty members find the\nprotests meaningless and demanded arrest of the students who are disrupting\nthe tranquility of the campus.\n\nMahesh Prasad Ahirwar, Professor of Ancient History, Culture and Archaeology\nbacked Khan's credentials and said the university had nothing to do with caste\nand religion.\n\n\u201cThose who were oppressed earlier are now coming and showing their ability.\nThis is the changing India: whoever is capable has the right to teach in BHU.\nI feel that those who oppose this should be punished as per law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vice-chancellor and other senior officials had on Thursday held\ndiscussions with representatives of the protesters for over two hours.\n\nThe vice-chancellor assured the students that the administration is committed\nto achieving the objectives of the university in providing equal educational\nand teaching opportunities to everyone irrespective of religion, caste,\ncommunity or gender.\n\nWhen arrived at Varanasi, Khan was the excitement of being selected as a\nfaculty at BHU, one of India\u2019s most prestigious universities apart, however,\nnow it has plummeted to nervousness.\n\nNow, he don't know what to do. When asked if he will fight to be here and\nteach the students, he answered by saying that it totally depended on the\nenvironment that follows. If it is one of inclusiveness, questions like this\nwon\u2019t arise. \u201cWhatever they have in their heart, I hope I can change that,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nend-of\n\n##### Tags: [firoze khan](/content/tags/firoze-khan),\n[bhu](/content/tags/bhu), [muslim professor](/content/tags/muslim-professor)\n\n##### Location: [India](/location/india), [Uttar\nPradesh](/location/india/uttar-pradesh), [Varanasi\n(Benares)](/location/india/uttar-pradesh/varanasi-benares)\n\n## Latest From India\n\n[![ Doctors wearing protective suits examine a woman in a bid to detect\nCOVID-19 positive cases, at a camp at Sewri slums during the nationwide\nlockdown, in Mumbai.

He had\nbeen saving up his money for the trip but with the damage the hurricane\ncaused, he decided that the money would best be spent elsewhere.\n\nFor the last week we\u2019ve been hearing about the **[damage Hurricane Dorian has\ncaused](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/hurricane-dorian-us-\nflorida/index.html)**. From the devastation in the Bahamas, to mandatory\nevacuations in Florida and state of emergencies in Georgia, everyone is\npreparing the best way they know how. And little Jermaine Bell is just one of\nmany trying to do their part.\n\nFor the last couple of days, Bell has also been giving out free hot dogs and\nsnacks along a highway in Allendale, South Carolina to those evacuating the\narea.\n\n\u201cThe people that are traveling to go to other places, I wanted them to have\nsome food to eat, so they can enjoy the ride to the place that they're going\nto stay at,\u201d Jermaine told Fox news.\n\nJermaine\u2019s grandmother said that he is an inspiration and a blessing to the\nevacuees.

As far back as I can\nremember it\u2019s been important to be on the right side of things\u2014further even:\nIn my baby book under \u201cbaby dislikes\u201d my dad wrote \u201cnuclear proliferation\u201d and\n\u201ccaviar.\u201d In middle school I started going to anti-war rallies and spending my\ntime arguing dress code constitutional law with the principal. My high school\nclass voted me \u201cmost outspoken,\u201d which was a nice way of saying that I\nwouldn\u2019t shut the fuck up about politics, no matter the subject. There are a\nlot more people who complain about \u201cPC\u201d than people who actually conform to\nthe stereotypes, but I more or less do.\n\nWhen I was a culturally engaged kid (roughly \u201996-\u201906), political correctness\nwas politically incorrect. In the Bay Area where I grew up we could assume\nmost people were liberals, Democrats, and more specifically anti-Bush\u2014if not\nnecessarily anti-war. But this was the heyday of the [_Man\nShow_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202741/) and [_South\nPark_](https://southpark.cc.com/)and [_Crank\nYankers_](http://www.cc.com/shows/crank-yankers) and, especially as a boy, the\nlast thing you were supposed to be was offended. By that time conservatives\nhad already been bellyaching for years on the covers of national magazines\nabout the \u201cPC\u201d menace, gleefully comparing college students to the Red Guards\nand, yes, Nazi stormtroopers. The script hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\n_[This essay is an excerpt from_[Shit is Fucked Up and Bullshit\u200b: History\nSince the End of History](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/shit-is-fucked-up-\nand-bullshit/) _, published by Melville House.]_\n\nPolitical correctness connotes not just the inability to let go and enjoy\nyourself (e.g. I have never seen a Will Ferrell comedy), but a weak character.\nAmerican history and humanities curricula still draw heavily on Cold War\nliberal ideas about the individual, and to be politically correct, we learn,\nis to surrender rather than cultivate your judgment. _Fahrenheit 451, 1984,\nLord of the Flies_ , _The Scarlet Letter_ , _The Crucible_ , _Animal Farm_ ,\n_Brave New World_ , _To Kill A Mockingbird_ : When Americans learn about\npolitics what we learn is that critical thinking means thinking \u201cfor\nyourself.\u201d Groupthink is part and parcel of tyranny, and attempts to get\neveryone to think the same way\u2014or make everyone act as if they\u2019re thinking the\nsame way\u2014are tyrannical. What is the crime of calling a classmate\u2019s shoes\n\u201cgay\u201d compared to the crime of telling other people what they\u2019re allowed to\nsay? It is, we are told, a slippery slope to Hitler.\n\nThe object of political correctness is rarely politics itself, at least not\nthe formal kind. The \u201cpolitics\u201d cancels itself out\u2014a secret ballot can\u2019t be\npolitically correct. The object is instead cultural, discursive, aesthetic.\nPolitical correctness is when you bring politics into spheres where it doesn\u2019t\nbelong, where it edges out judgment (or non-judgmental taste and tradition).\nPolitics is about picking between options and letting yourself be counted on\none side or the other, while judgment and taste are where and how we define\nourselves as individuals. And only as judging, tasting individuals are we\ncapable of delegating our judgment by vote. Political correctness, then,\npoisons our culture and the democracy that depends on it.\n\nUnder capitalism there\u2019s no movie set that\u2019s not a workplace, no marriage\nthat\u2019s not a workplace, no classroom that\u2019s not a workplace.\n\nThat is, as I understand it, the strongest version of the argument against\npolitical correctness. It is fundamentally a liberal argument in the classical\nsense, which helps explain why some of the strongest and most consistent\nreactions against PC come from one-tick-left-or-right-of-center pundits like\n[Jonathan Chait](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/01/not-a-very-pc-thing-\nto-say.html) and [David\nBrooks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/politics-race-white-\ntribalism.html). The issue among progressives and conservatives is where the\nlines of separation between spheres should be, which helps explain why the\nstory of a gay wedding cake\u2014a private baked good linked to a traditional\nreligious rite that is also now a civil right\u2014has acquired outlandishly large\nsignificance. _Discrimination_ is a synonym for both _judgment_ and _taste_ ,\nand the long conservative fight for the right to discriminate against is about\nmore than organizing oppression, it\u2019s about preserving that capacity.\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting that any moderately close reading of American history shows\nthat elected progressives do not fight to extend the realm of the political so\nmuch as manage demands from elements in the public to do so. As I write it\u2019s\nbeen less than 10 years since we marched in Washington, DC, for gay marriage,\nand Democratic lawmakers were not running out to join us.)\n\nConservatives can be politically correct, too, as liberals like to remind\nthem. When they defended the criminalization of homosexuality, for example,\nthey extended the realm of politics into the bedroom. The fight to ban\nabortion is likewise an intrusion of the political into the medical. Strict\nlibertarians of the _Reason_ magazine type consistently oppose political\ncorrectness of both kinds, defending the right to our taste in both cake\ncustomers and sex acts. But though the unrealistically fair-minded see the\npolitical spectrum as a horseshoe, when we\u2019re talking political correctness,\nwe\u2019re talking about the left.\n\nWhere libertarians want to shrink the realm of the political as small as\npossible, for the PC, \u201ceverything is political.\u201d This was a repeated complaint\nin John Taylor\u2019s 1991 _New York_ cover story [\u201cAre You Politically\nCorrect?\u201d](https://literaryreview.co.uk/are-you-politically-correct) The noted\nacademic taste-and-judgment fanatic [Stanley\nFish](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/yet-once-more-\npolitical-correctness-on-campus/) is overly fond of the \u201cIs everything\npolitical?\u201d phrase, using it in op-eds year after year to argue against\npolitics in the classroom. The lament \u201ceverything is political now\u201d turns up\n1,180 results on Google, including the _Chicago Tribune_ headline gem:\n[\u201cEverything is political these days, even the moon\nlanding.\u201d](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-dfr-blaser-moon-landing-\ntl-0913-story.html) But who are the people who really do believe that\neverything is political?\n\nCommunists.\n\n\u2605\n\n_Hitherto philosophers have had the solution of all riddles lying in their\nwriting-desks, and the stupid, exoteric world had only to open its mouth for\nthe roast pigeons of absolute knowledge to fly into it. Now philosophy has\nbecome mundane, and the most striking proof of this is that philosophical\nconsciousness itself has been drawn into the torment of the struggle, not only\nexternally but also internally. But, if constructing the future and settling\neverything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we\nhave to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless criticism of all\nthat exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it\narrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with\nthe powers that be.\u2014_ Karl Marx,\n[letter](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_09.htm)\nto Arnold Ruge (1843)\n\n  \nIf you ask the average conservative, they\u2019ll probably tell you political\ncorrectness starts with Soviet Russia, more specifically Josef Stalin. On one\nlevel this story is simply wrong. But on a deeper, more important level, it\u2019s\ncomplicatedly wrong. Marching the political into \u201call that exists\u201d truly is\npart of the Marxist plot, from the factory to the family (\u201cDo you charge us\nwith wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents?\u201d says the\nManifesto, \u201cTo this crime we plead guilty.\u201d) Succeeding waves of Marxists have\npaid him the highest tribute by occasionally finding Marx himself politically\nincorrect, extending his analysis even further into society in accordance with\nthe method.\n\n\u201cCultural Marxism\u201d has no particular meaning within the tradition of Marxist\nthought, whereas it does have a noted history as a code phrase on the\nantisemitic right. Lately it\u2019s become a sort of harder-core synonym for\npolitical correctness, one that evinces a familiarity with far-right politics\nrather than garden-variety annoyance at college students. And yet, I admit,\nthere\u2019s some validity to the idea. The complaint\u2014similar to the one about\npolitical correctness\u2014is that Marxists want to subject every facet of society\nto politics, including the cultural sphere, which liberals (from right to\nleft) believe is properly a realm of individuality.\n\nHere\u2019s how we might imagine they understand the cultural Marxist slippery\nslope: Instead of judging a comedian based on how funny they are, cultural\nMarxists want to judge adherence to a political line, which isn\u2019t really\njudgment at all, it\u2019s verification. At that point we\u2019re no longer audience\nmembers or consumers or even people, we become bureaucrats, always looking for\na condemnatory box to check. Slowly and then quickly cultural producers are\nincentivized and forced to conform, and we\u2019re left in a desert of art so\nsycophantic it barely deserves the title.\n\nWith the development of social media and the contentification of everyday\npeople\u2019s regular speech we have a greater awareness of the role we all play in\nforming culture. What separated earlier generations of professional artists\nand critics from the amateurs was plausible reach, but now anyone online could\ngo viral. This is occasionally thrilling for everyone involved (see: [Lil Nas\nX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qovpFAGrQ)), but it also makes more of us\nsubject to expectations and pressures of political correctness that used to be\nreserved for public speakers. And if we\u2019re deprived of a space beyond politics\nwe can\u2019t develop the courage or ability to exercise judgment, and we become\nthe most dangerous kinds of citizens: all political allegiance, no critical\nthought.\n\nPolitical correctness is politically incorrect under liberalism because it\nasks that we think of ourselves as members of a class before we think of\nourselves as individuals.\n\nThis vision of life without thought is a caricature of socialism that\nAmericans learn in school, along with social-contract theory, which is taught\nas fact. Politics is where we surrender our freedom to the state in return for\na vote, yes, but also a retained freedom in the spheres of judgment and taste,\nwhich is where individuality and creativity thrive. The trade is between each\nindividual and society as embodied in the nation: There are laws, but\notherwise no one can tell you anything. On the other hand, Marxists, we\u2019re\ntold, don\u2019t believe in the individual at all. Everything must be sacrificed to\nthe collective.\n\nDespite what you may have heard, Marxists recognize that people exist. But\nunlike liberals (in both red and blue flavors), we don\u2019t understand the world\nvia the existential individual\u2019s relationship to society. Recorded human\nhistory is the history of class conflict, and every child is born into a\nspecific historical moment and into a specific position within that specific\nmoment. Societies, we Marxists believe, have their characters determined by\ntheir relations of production, sometimes called society\u2019s \u201cbase.\u201d Feudal\nsociety was feudal, and capitalist society\u2014under the first truly global mode\nof production\u2014is capitalist. That means, in the simplest version, that the\nconflict between workers and owners is what structures the rest. \u201cIt is as\nthough light of a particular hue were cast upon everything,\u201d Marx\n[writes](https://books.google.com/books?id=BnF9BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=%E2%80%9CIt+is+as+though+light+of+a+particular+hue+were+cast+upon+everything,%E2%80%9D+marx&source=bl&ots=Q-CFVibzsG&sig=ACfU3U1SI-0qbwtuv1DxXCVUJq70rV7AMQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHppe07e_nAhXVo54KHQSEBpAQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CIt%20is%20as%20though%20light%20of%20a%20particular%20hue%20were%20cast%20upon%20everything%2C%E2%80%9D%20marx&f=false),\n\u201ctingeing all other colors and modifying their specific features.\u201d Upon\n_everything_.\n\nUnder capitalism there\u2019s no movie set that\u2019s not a workplace, no marriage\nthat\u2019s not a workplace, no classroom that\u2019s not a workplace. All is bathed in\nthe light of that particular hue. If that sounds unfortunate or monotonous, it\nshould. As Americans we\u2019re taught to see that rosy light as an eternal sunset,\nhistory and struggle being put to bed, liberal democracy, the foundation for\nfree taste and judgment. Marxists see a red dawn, a storm rising on a new day.\nAny mode of production based on exploitation is unstable and rife with\nconflict. (In order to use Marxist analysis without drawing attention to it,\nsociologists often say \u201cconflict theory\u201d instead.) Owners try to get the most\nout of their workers and workers try to get the most out of life, goals that\nare fundamentally at odds. The sparks from these grinding gears light the\nwhole world.\n\n\u2605\n\nIf everything is properly understood as political\u2014that is to say, engaged one\nway or another in the all-consuming struggle that defines society\u2014how do we\ntell what\u2019s on the right side? We\u2019re taught to see political correctness as a\nshortcut around thought, where all that\u2019s necessary is to verify adherence to\nthe latest in PC phraseology. With a socialist party it\u2019s even easier: agree\nwith the Party. But Marxism is about constant criticism, and the most vibrant\ncontemporary schools of thought emerge in part out of criticisms of the Soviet\nsystem. And not, like say Camus or Orwell, from within the liberal tradition.\n\nThe visual arts are a frequent subject of anti-PC complaint, with\nconservatives fearmongering about the bland uniformity of socialist painting.\nMaking politically correct art is easy, they say, so if we judge art according\nto its political correctness, we surrender the lens of quality. [John\nBerger](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Berger) confounds this view.\nBerger is one of the few great critics who is also universally acclaimed as a\ngreat artist. With novels like\n[_G._](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/19/john-berger-g-classics-\nbooker), [_To The\nWedding_](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_the_Wedding.html?id=XIWLDQAAQBAJ),\nand the[ _Into Their Labors_\ntrilogy](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45399-6_4),\nBerger proved himself skilled beyond doubt, and his [_Ways of\nSeeing_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/324430/ways-of-seeing-by-\njohn-berger/)(and its BBC adaptation) is perhaps the single most influential\nwork of English-language art criticism. And yet, Berger was resolutely\npolitically correct, to a degree that sometimes shocked his liberal peers. In\na debate with British art historian Benedict Nicolson over the work of Italian\nsocialist painter Renato Guttuso, Berger is rigid:\n\n> Berger: A work of art is moving in direct ratio to the degree to which it\n> extends our experience of significant, objective facts.\n>\n> Nicolson: Come now! \u2026 It would be foolish to argue that Van Gogh was less\n> significant as an artist when expressing intensely personal emotions than\n> when gearing his sensations to some social ideal.\n>\n> Berger: I completely disagree. The most moving Van Goghs are precisely those\n> in which his intense emotions are are applied to objective reality. It was\n> because his own over-personal sensations finally smothered his vision that\n> he killed himself. One day his work will be reassessed in the light of this\n> fact.\n\nHarsh!\n\nNicolson finds it hard to believe Berger is actually saying what he\u2019s saying.\nHow can an artist of Berger\u2019s capacity\u2014never mind an art _critic_ of his\nability\u2014talk about a universal standard for judging quality? How can someone\nwho crafts fictions at the highest level talk of \u201cobjective reality\u201d that way?\nTo Nicolson\u2019s complaint that Guttuso would \u201cnever depict corruption among the\nworkers\u201d because to do so would be contrary to the painter\u2019s politics, Berger\nanswers it would be contrary to the _truth_ :\n\n> Arbitrarily isolated facts can only lead to triviality in art\u2026Of course,\n> there are individual corrupt workers. Of course, there are decent\n> bourgeoisie. But the fact remains that it is the peasants in Italy who\n> remain undernourished, the working class who, in the struggle for their\n> rights, get shot, and the bourgeoisie who connive.\n\nNot individuals but classes. This is what Berger means by \u201cobjective\u201d: more\nthan the accurate story of something that happened, it\u2019s about grasping the\nclass struggles that structure the world. The best an artist who\nmisunderstands the objective truth of their society can hope for, as Berger\nwrites about Jackson Pollock, is that \u201chis talent will reveal how it itself\nhas been wasted.\u201d It\u2019s a difference in task akin to that between \u201cblowing\nsmoke rings and struggling like a wainwright to fashion a wheel that will\nturn.\u201d Content to blow smoke rings, Pollock\u2019s drip paintings are politically\nincorrect because he fails to develop the significance of his subject. Berger\nnever joined the Communist Party and he maintained a deep contempt for state\nbureaucracy. His PC model was not passed down from above. Rather it came from\nhis rigorous application of the Marxist method to the interpretation of\nculture. It\u2019s not quite as easy as it sounds.\n\n\u2605\n\nIn 1972, the 24 year old Chilean artist, poet, and activist [Cecilia\nVicu\u00f1a](http://www.ceciliavicuna.com/) began work on a series of four\npaintings called [_H\u00e9roes de la\nRevoluci\u00f3n_](https://www.manifestajournal.org/online-residencies/miguel-\nlopez/heroes-revolution-0). The democratic socialist government of Salvador\nAllende was in power, and Vicu\u00f1a, like our stereotype of a good PC painter,\nproduced portraits of socialist icons: Marx, Lenin, Fidel Castro meeting\nAllende, and left-wing Chilean folklorist Violeta Parra. But these aren\u2019t the\nkitschy realist works we\u2019ve come to expect. Her Marx stands outsized on an\naqua-green hill, the trees behind him purple. He is dignified, besuited with\nhis hair in a white mane, a steady look toward the horizon. Above his head\nfloats a banner with his name in cursive, flanked by seven colored roses:\npink, yellow, and baby blue. Behind Marx to his left, in the background, two\nthick-thighed naked women make out. \u201cIn order to exalt Marx, I wanted to\nassociate him with ideas that dogmaticians consider way removed from him, such\nas eroticism, poetics, blues, jazz and rock, female and homosexual liberation\nand that I consider intrinsic to the revolution,\u201d Vicu\u00f1a wrote at the time.\n\n![](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/20200226_marx_warhol_2000_more.jpg?w=642)![](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/20200226_marx_warhol_2000_more.jpg?w=642)Mother Jones\nillustration; Wikipedia\n\nEven though she was an active member of the government\u2019s party, Vicu\u00f1a ran\ninto some problems. She told the journal _Manifesta_ that the painting of\nCastro and Allende was set to be shown at the National Fine Arts Museum but at\nthe last minute they asked her to censor it. The painting shows the two\nleaders in profile, large heads tapering to small feet. Their right hands are\nclasped, with his left Fidel points to a butterfly balanced on Allende\u2019s\noutstretched palm. Below them is a garland of flowers and in the same cursive,\n\u201cFidel\u201d and \u201cAllende,\u201d like a journal doodling from a socialist historical\nslash fic. Their heads are leaned out and their hips tilt toward each other.\nAllende\u2019s background arm is naked, and in the original (a black-and-white\npicture of which is memorialized in the artist\u2019s book _Sabor a Mi_ ) so was\nFidel\u2019s foreground leg. The museum\u2019s director told her that the right-wing\nattacked left-wing leaders as queers and the painting risked being\nmisinterpreted as mocking its subjects. Vicu\u00f1a covered Castro to the ankle.\n\nVicu\u00f1a\u2019s paintings wouldn\u2019t hang long in the National Museum. On September 11,\n1973 Augusto Pinochet seized power in a coup, beginning his brutal reign of\nterror in Chile. Vicu\u00f1a and the museum director both went into exile, her\nstaying London, him fleeing to Catalonia. Allende, after a live farewell\naddress via radio and right before the presidential palace was taken, shot\nhimself in the head. He\u2019s said to have used an AK-47 he had received as a\ngift, bearing the engraving: \"To my good friend Salvador from Fidel, who by\ndifferent means tries to achieve the same goals.\" Vicu\u00f1a didn\u2019t paint any more\n_Heroes_.Who\u2019s the politically correct one in the story? Liberals would\nprobably say the censorious museum director, but don\u2019t forget the artist was\ndoing a portrait series called _Heroes of the Revolution_ honoring\u2014and she was\nhonoring\u2014Marx, Lenin, and her socialist president. (It\u2019s not an anomalous\nsituation either, plenty of left-wing artists have clashed with left-wing\nauthorities.) Almost 50 years later, I think Vicu\u00f1a got the politics right the\nfirst time. My favorite of the series is Marx, in large part because of the\ncolor palette. With the brown sky and blue-green hill it has a frolicking\nalmost psychedelic vibe, and lording over it like a calm tuxedoed godzilla is\nKarl. The world is transformed: down come the walls between seriousness and\nfrivolity, between masculine and feminine, between thought and being. A\nsocialism that\u2019s afraid of a naked leg or lesbian sex is a brittle thing. And,\nas we learned from the 20th century, a moral disaster waiting to happen.\n\n\u2605\n\nOne of the more politically correct movies I\u2019ve ever seen is John Singleton\u2019s\n2005 action drama _Four Brothers_. On its face it seems like a strange choice\nbecause much of the movie consists of racist dickhead Mark Wahlberg joyfully\nplaying a racist dickhead. Along with his three brothers\u2014all four of them\nadopted as children by the same do-gooder\u2014Wahlberg\u2019s character seeks vengeance\nwhen their mom is murdered. They trace the hit to local gangster Victor Sweet\n(Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nThe turning point isn\u2019t when Wahlberg\u2019s character beats up Sweet and throws\nhim into an ice-fishing hole, it\u2019s before, when his brother Jeremiah (Andr\u00e9\nBenjamin) reveals that he\u2019s made a deal with Sweet\u2019s henchmen, offering them\nmoney that had been promised to Sweet to turn on their boss. Up until then the\nfact that Jeremiah had been \u201cin the union\u201d with Sweet\u2019s guy Evan (Jernard\nBurks) was exposition, post-industrial Detroit worldbuilding. In his political\ncorrectness Singleton brings it to the fore at the crucial moment. And in a\nmovie full to the brim with starpower, it\u2019s Burks, a Black actor whose credits\nare listed mostly by occupation rather than character name, who delivers the\nkiller line to his gangster boss: \u201cThe one thing you forgot about me is this:\nl was in the union for a long time. l ain't never missed no meetings.\u201d\n\nTo be politically correct is not to be self-satisfied or to rest on your\nlaurels of compliance, it is to constantly hammer at your own work.\n\nThere\u2019s always some surprise twist in an action drama like _Four Brothers_ ;\nhow else would the underdogs win in the end? But of all the double-crosses and\nshocking reveals Singleton and the writers David Elliot and Paul Lovett could\nhave picked, they choose the one that extends our experience of significant,\nobjective facts. It seems to come out of nowhere, but that couldn\u2019t be further\nfrom the truth. The conflict that structures society is not about gangs of\nindividuals haphazardly tossed into battle with each other, as we\u2019re often led\nto believe by action flicks, it\u2019s between classes of oppressors and oppressed.\nVictor Sweet forgets it as well, treating his employees with the vicious\ndisrespect that\u2019s characteristic of villains, and Jeremiah is able to save the\nday by maintaining his fidelity to the organized labor movement.\n\nWas John Singleton a PC hack? Everyone likes _Boyz n the Hood_.\n\n\u2605\n\nNothing undermines the standard complaints about politically correct art more\nthan the overrepresentation of committed Marxists in the various artistic\ncanons.\n\n> _The only way that poets and painters can fight against the bourgeois\n> economy is to give their works precisely that content which challenges the\n> bourgeois ideological values propping up the bourgeois economy_.\u2014[Rene\n> Magritte](https://books.google.com/books?id=sCl0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&lpg=PT184&dq=%E2%80%9CThe+only+way+that+poets+and+painters+can+fight+against+the+bourgeois+economy+is+to+give+their+works+precisely+that+content+which+challenges+the+bourgeois+ideological+values+propping+up+the+bourgeois+economy.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Rene+Magritte&source=bl&ots=UZsBmZpLeo&sig=ACfU3U0sU7GQJGdoq1kAjmspYP28kBUkHQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjU_7Xo6-_nAhWSK30KHdIoAecQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20only%20way%20that%20poets%20and%20painters%20can%20fight%20against%20the%20bourgeois%20economy%20is%20to%20give%20their%20works%20precisely%20that%20content%20which%20challenges%20the%20bourgeois%20ideological%20values%20propping%20up%20the%20bourgeois%20economy.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Rene%20Magritte&f=false)\n>\n> _My joining the Communist Party is a logical step in my life, my work and\n> gives them their meaning.

These artists\u2014there are too many to list, including\nwhole movements, such as the Harlem Renaissance, that American pedagogy has\nstripped of their communist politics\u2014held themselves and each other to the\nstandard of political correctness, applying it (as Kahlo does in the quote\nabove) critically. To be politically correct is not to be self-satisfied or to\nrest on your laurels of compliance; it is to constantly hammer at your own\nwork, your own self, and the world around you, so that it might become\n\u201csomething useful\u201d politically. It means engagement and protest and weighing\ncompromise and sometimes fleeing for your life. Far from staid or\nconservative, it\u2019s a risky, experimental way to live.\n\n\u2605\n\nPolitical correctness (as shorthand for \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d) is politically\n_incorrect_ under liberalism because it asks that we think of ourselves as\nmembers of a class before we think of ourselves as individuals. Since classes\nare constituted by relations of exploitation, we think of ourselves first as\nworkers or bosses in conflict, and women and men in conflict, and colonizers\nand colonized in conflict. (Looking at class relations beyond worker/boss is\nno violation of Marxist orthodoxy.) We shape our judgment and taste with our\npolitics rather than the other way around. This is anathema to liberals, for\nwhom individuals must think and act primarily as individuals, lest conformity\noverflow judgment, capsize meritocracy, and drown democracy.\n\nThey think we want to destroy the whole world as their eyes have adjusted to\nit. And they\u2019re right.\n\nLiberals find the idea that anything is more important than the individual,\nwell, offensive. But does the world treat us as individuals? Is that what you\ntell a boss who has just laid you off? \u201cI\u2019m sorry the stockholders took a hit,\nbut I need this job, and as you know nothing is more important than the\nindividual.\u201d Do we each wander a lonely path, advancing next to but separate\nfrom the people around us according to a mix of skill and luck, like a board\ngame token? Does the world conform to our judgments, or is truer to say we\nmostly get what we get? Is it all-against-all or class-against-class? If the\nanswer is the latter\u2014and it is\u2014then whose side you\u2019re on precedes your\nindividuality in importance. The individual only comes out when the\nauthorities are looking for a distraction, a scapegoat, or an excuse.\n\nThe significant objective fact is that we live in a class society, and until\nwe don\u2019t anymore, that will continue to be the significant objective fact. To\nbe PC is to acknowledge that truth as found, to recognize that we don\u2019t each\nof us need to go rummaging through the bargain basement of ideas to understand\nsociety. The task for communists is to work with constancy and rigor in our\nthought and action toward a revolutionary break with class society. It\u2019s only\nthere, on an earth where people are not grouped for exploitation, where we can\nspeak meaningfully about the individual. We\u2019re looking forward to it.\n\nCapitalism\u2019s \u201cparticular hue\u201d colors everything on the planet and even some\nstuff beyond; capitalists have wasted countless lives to make it so. If\npolitical correctness means Marxism which means the abolition of class society\nwhich means everything changes, then by the transitive property of equality,\nPC means the end of the world. When people object to political correctness\nthat\u2019s the real root of what they\u2019re talking about: They think we want to\ndestroy the whole world as their eyes have adjusted to it. And they\u2019re right.\nBut would that be so bad? To smash that ugly fluorescent overhead light would\nchange everything, it\u2019s true, but we needn\u2019t fear being left in the dark.

FOLKERTS\n\nFLORENCE, Wis. -- A Green Bay, Wis., man arrested after a high-speed chase\nthat ended with a crash near Burma Road pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Florence\nCounty Circuit Court.\n\nPierce Folkerts, 31, is charged with fleeing and eluding an officer resulting\nin bodily harm and concealing stolen property, both felonies punishable by up\nto six years in prison.\n\nFolkerts also is charged with reckless driving causing injury, a misdemeanor\nwith a one-year penalty; and obstructing an officer, a nine-month misdemeanor.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Florence County deputies were alerted\nSept. 8 to an attempt to locate a stolen vehicle by the Brown County Sheriff's\nOffice.\n\nBrown County dispatch advised Florence deputies Folkerts was in the vehicle\nand had been involved in four vehicle thefts and three pursuits the previous\nweek, the complaint states. Dispatch also advised Folkerts had been traveling\nwith a female passenger who had a relative in Homestead, Wis.\n\nThe relative called authorities to report the stolen vehicle on their\nproperty. They believed the occupants were sleeping but later stated they saw\nmovement, the complaint stated.\n\nFlorence County deputies located and approached the vehicle with weapons and\nelectronic control devices drawn, though body cameras were not activated,\naccording to the complaint.\n\nThe deputies reportedly announced their presence and knocked on the rear\ndriver's side window of the vehicle when they observed Folkerts and the female\npassenger in the backseat.\n\nFolkerts ignored instructions to show his hands and moved into the front seat\nof the vehicle, according to the complaint. Folkerts then started the vehicle\nand maneuvered around the deputy squad car.\n\nAn earlier release from Florence County Sheriff Dan Miller stated deputies\npursued Folkerts for about 5 miles until he hit a tire deflation device. The\nvehicle went off the road and into a stand of trees near the intersection of\nBurma and Sand Lake roads, according to the complaint.\n\nFolkerts fled on foot and was later caught with assistance of a K-9 unit from\nthe Green Bay Police Department. He and the female passenger in the vehicle\nwere transported to a hospital for treatment.\n\nA pre-trial conference is scheduled for Nov. 19. Bond is set at $10,000 cash.\n\n# Newsletter\n\nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox\n\n**I'm interested in (please check all that apply)**\n\n  * Daily Newsletter\n  * Breaking News\n\n# COMMENTS\n\n[\n\n# Local News\n\n](https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/local-news/) [\n\n# Michigan lawmakers extend emergency declaration in pandemic\n\n](https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/local-news/2020/04/michigan-\nlawmakers-extend-emergency-declaration-in-pandemic/)\n\nLANSING, Mich.

As you\u2019ve no doubt heard by\nnow if you\u2019re a reader of this site, there are some major changes on the way\nfor Halos Heaven and around SBN more broadly in the next couple of weeks.\nNamely that most of the people who write for it and run it, like Jessica and\nJeff, will be cast out and replaced by someone else. Most likely a soccer fan\nwho lives in Sacramento and who will spend about as much time making HH happen\nas they will wishing they could afford to live in San Francisco with all the\ncool gig economy tech people. If only they could write better scripts to write\narticles for them...\n\n...not that I know that\u2019s gonna be the case, but probably. I guess we just\ncan\u2019t have nice things in America anymore.\n\nIn light of all this and the fact that the overall sentiment in the\nannouncement threads about the AB5/Vox-Are-Basically-Sith threads was in favor\nof leaving HH for another site where the community could continue to thrive\nand operate under its own merit, I decided it would be fun to go on a\nhistorical journey from my perspective on this site before all that happens.\n\nA younger Commander_Nate joined HH just over 10 years ago after the\n[Angels](https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/los-angeles-angels)\u2019 last\nnoteworthy postseason run, so I like to think I\u2019ve had a pretty good vantage\npoint to serve as an informal village oracle in addition to being one of\nseveral resident degens around here (reformed somewhat now, thank you very\nmuch). I don\u2019t remember the exact nature of my joining, but it had something\nto do with the [MLB.com](http://MLB.com) forum sucking, wanting to argue\npassionately about [Juan\nRivera](https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/1102/juan-rivera), and generally\nfinding Rev and Wi and the rest of the old guard\u2019s DGAF, refined punk rock\nvibe right up my alley. Things sort of spiraled from there over the next few\nyears, when I was probably more productive on HH than I was at my dead-end job\nat the time (and so were a lot of you, admit it).\n\nAfter some painstaking research (seriously, the search function on this\nsite...mother of God), I\u2019ve compiled the below list of some of my personal\nfavorite moments on HH. Hopefully you\u2019ll remember them all as fondly as I do,\nand hopefully you\u2019ll share your personal faves in the comments, because that\u2019s\nwhat this place is really about: you, me, and all the rest of us.\n\n### 5 - [Gary Matthews Jr.](https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/710/gary-\nmatthews-jr), The Trading Away Of\n\nYep, Gary Matthews Jr. Bet you haven\u2019t thought of that name in a while, huh?\nRemember when this team **only** wasted $50 or so million on overrated\noutfielders it didn\u2019t need? Those were the days, and we had the\n[Mets](https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-mets) to thank for ending\nwhat at the time we thought would be our last fiasco of this sort. After\ngetting inspired by some pretty funny writing about [Brian\nStokes](https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/680/brian-stokes), whom we\nreceived in return for GMJ, I wrote [this\npiece](https://www.halosheaven.com/2010/1/27/1272517/a-day-in-the-life-of-\ngary-matthews), which to this day remains one of my favorite contributions to\nthe site. Taking a look at all those names again led by Vlad makes me a little\nbummed that group never got a ring, but hey, they were fun to watch and at\nleast Howie\u2019s got one now.\n\n### 4 - WiHaloFan\u2019s Comic Series\n\nDepending when you joined HH, you should remember these as they were a staple\non the front page for some time. And they were always good, especially when\nthey focused on HH itself and included site members as characters, [like this\none](https://www.halosheaven.com/2011/2/4/1975453/we-all-flew-over-the-\ncuckoos-nest#58519421). There are many more and you\u2019ve probably got your own\nfavorites if you remember them. Unfortunately the search function wasn\u2019t as\nhelpful here as I hoped it would be.\n\n### 3 - Rabble Rousing Against the Front Office and their Jeter Tribute Plan\n\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory, but it\u2019s still pretty cool that [one post\n](https://www.halosheaven.com/2011/8/3/2342167/say-no-to-dj3k)turned into a PR\nnightmare for the team and actually got one of us on the phone direct to Tim\nMead. Internet fueled fandom at its finest. Well done again, folks. More\nappropriate to remember this one now given the HoF news too.\n\n### 2 - The Pujols and Ohtani Signings\n\nAgain, these are both pretty self-explanatory, but the sheer joy and\ncamaraderie that came with them is something I\u2019ll always remember about this\nplace and these moments in the team\u2019s history. Being around for these was\nhonestly a bit like being in the stadium at full capacity, but better because\nyou could actually talk to each other and not just the drunk person next to\nyou (which was also still an option, obviously). From the lava-shitting-\ninfinite-navel-drinking debauchery of the [Pujols signing\nthread](https://www.halosheaven.com/2011/12/8/2620535/angels-sign-albert-\npujols) to the euphoria at the history we were about to watch when [Ohtani\nsigned](https://www.halosheaven.com/2017/12/8/16752828/mlb-trade-rumors-\nshohei-ohtani-is-signing-with-the-los-angeles-angels) and the possibilities of\nhim paired with Trout, these were moments that being a fan and a member of HH\nare all about.\n\nOhtani in particular was a dream come true for me because of the obsession I\u2019d\nacquired for Japanese and Korean baseball thanks to the [World Baseball\nClassic](http://www.sbnation.com/world-baseball-classic). Finally, all that\nwriting about Darvish, Tanaka, Ryu, and others I annoyed you all with had paid\noff. One of the best days in my fandom ever.\n\n### 1 - PhiSlamma vs Halowood\n\nThis was relatively early in my tenure here, but if you were around for this\nbattle, there\u2019s no way you can forget it. Its songs echoed across fanshot and\nfanpost alike for years. Tales of the deeds done on the field in those days\nwere never more than a comment away every time the FO was about to do\nsomething foolish, or a new troll came along. A new troll, who, no matter how\nshitty their posts, how faulty their logic, or how prolonged in their\npreaching, could never fully equal the one true Dark Lord.\n\nAfter much searching, I finally found the moment the forces of light won their\nfinal victory over the darkness at the tip of PhiSlamma\u2019s spear. The heroic\n[words in the post](https://www.halosheaven.com/2010/11/23/1832689/three-left-\nfield-trade-options#52894811) are etched in time for all eternity as you can\nsee, but unfortunately the original pics are lost to us. Thankfully, I have a\ncopy of the first pic in the attack that we\u2019ve all come to know and love so\nmuch. Those of you who were around no doubt remember how hard you laughed at\nyour desk on this day, and I hope revisiting the incident nearly a decade\nlater still brings a grin to your face.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/pHL3ZPFKtMzwUr3pJxmhQpo5ngA=/0x0:455x455/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:455x455\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19619292/6a00d83451c29169e200e55_medium.jpg)\nThe counter-trolling counterstrike meme we all know and love.\n\nOur resident panda, Phi, seems to have disappeared, but that was just one of\nmany of his platinum-level contributions to this community that helped draw me\nand many others in. I don\u2019t know what happened to him; maybe he finally found\nthe bottom of that Bacardi bottle in his profile pic, and I hope wherever he\u2019s\nposting now it\u2019s as a happy bear.  \n  \nI\u2019d also be remiss for not mentioning several others of the old guard who\nreally made this place what it was when I first came on board: Quad Fin Rider,\nSuboptimal, cath619, Wi, Stirrups, Turks Teeth, 2pints, 5thStarter, red_floyd,\nRev, Josh, and so many more up to Jessica and the current crew that will be\nclosing this place down. Thanks for a decade-plus of good times and making the\nwork day suck a lot less. And thanks for teaching me so much more about the\nAngels and baseball than I ever knew in a fun environment. I\u2019m seriously a\nbetter fan and probably a funnier person for it, and also a better writer on\naccount of having to keep up with you all.\n\nHere\u2019s looking forward to the future of this community in a new home, which\nthere may be more details to follow shortly. Halos Heaven is dead, long live\nHalos Heaven!\n\nCommander_Nate, signing off.\n\n##  More From Halos Heaven\n\n  * [MLB: No plan yet to resume games](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/7/21212265/mlb-statement-coronavirus-arizona-schedule)\n  * [Trout daily: A 5-hit game at Yankee Stadium](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/7/21209214/mike-trout-home-run-5-hits-yankee-stadium-angels-2018)\n  * [Re-watch Tim Salmon hitting a homer off Mike Mussina](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/7/21210194/angels-news-cal-ripken-jr-streak-tim-salmon-shohei-ohtani)\n  * [Mike Trout leads PSA for staying home](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/6/21209940/mike-trout-psa-staying-home-los-angeles)\n  * [Mike Trout daily: Returning the arrow to Fernando Rodney](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/6/21206058/mike-trout-home-run-mariners-fernando-rodney-2014)\n  * [Andrelton Simmons knows greatness when he sees it](https://www.halosheaven.com/2020/4/6/21209088/angels-news-andrelton-simmons-backyard-baseball)\n\n###  Most Read\n\n  1.

[+] the Celtics had toppled the Los Angeles Lakers in\nthe 2008 NBA Finals, passed away from cancer five years ago. But his legacy\nlives on with ESPN and the V Foundation. (Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cBoo-Yah\u201d was a signature catchphrase of the late Stuart Scott, ESPN\u2019s\ntrailblazing sports broadcaster, who passed away from cancer five years ago.\nIt also may be an apt reaction to today\u2019s news that\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/ \"https://www.espn.com/\") has helped raise over\n$8.8 million during [the V Week for Cancer\nResearch](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2019/11/209779/\n\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2019/11/209779/\"), which ran from\nDecember 3 to December 14, 2019, for the [V Foundation for Cancer\nResearch](https://www.v.org/ \"https://www.v.org/\").\n\nWhen Scott used \u201cboo-yah,\u201d he probably wasn\u2019t referring to booyah, a thick\nstew with a meat bone broth. That would have been odd on a sports show.\nInstead, he was likely using the other definition of the term: \u201cto express\ntriumph or exuberance,\u201d [in the words of the  _Merriam Webster_\ndictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/booyah\n\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/booyah\"). And exuberance and\ntriumph may be feeling with the revelation that the 2019 V Week fundraising\nefforts surpassed the previous record of $8.3 million from the 2018 V Week by\nabout 6%. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to see more resources go into fighting\ncancer? Cancer is the second leading cause of death around the world, claiming\n9.6 million lives in 2018, [according to the World Health Organization\n(WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer\n\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer\").\n\nBrent Colborne, Director of Programming and Acquisitions at ESPN, explained\nthat \u201cthe vision of the V Foundation is something that is in our blood and DNA\nat ESPN. Our employees and colleagues care a lot about the cause and have been\nvery dedicated to helping raise funds.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/healthcare)\n\n  * [\n\n### Hydroxychloroquine For COVID-19: Cure-All Or Flim-Flam?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anitabartholomew/2020/04/08/hydroxychloroquine-\nfor-covid-19-cure-all-or-flim-flam/)\n\n  * [\n\n### To Develop A Vaccine Against Coronavirus, Scientists Are Recruiting Other\nViruses To Fight The War\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/04/08/to-develop-a-vaccine-\nagainst-coronavirus-scientists-are-recruiting-other-viruses-to-fight-the-war/)\n\n  * [\n\n### The COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease May Be Twice As Contagious As We Thought\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/04/07/the-covid19-coronavirus-\ndisease-may-be-twice-as-contagious-as-we-thought/)\n\n![Sage Steele](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e38f7e7a854780006b06345/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nSage Steele, co-host of ESPN's SportsCenter, recently joined the V Foundation\nfor Cancer Research ... [+] Board. (Photo: Courtesy of ESPN)\n\n2017, ESPN Inc.\n\nThe V Foundation for Cancer Research has been around since ESPN and the late\nJim Valvano founded the organization in 1993. If you\u2019ve never heard of\nValvano, just Google \u201cNorth Carolina State coach running around looking for\nsomeone to hug\u201d and you\u2019ll find videos of him doing just that after his\nWolfpack team had won the 1983 NCAA basketball championships. That win remains\none of the greatest upsets in college basketball history as NC State toppled a\nformidable University of Houston team that had Clyde Drexler and Hakeem\nOlajuwon and called themselves Phi Slamma Jamma in honor of their high DQ,\ndunking quotients. Valvano scampering around the court was the first of many\nexuberant moments for the frequently exuberant head coach who eventually\nbecame an equally exuberant analyst for ESPN. At ESPN, he periodically took\nexuberance to an exuberantly high level, when he paired up with the\nexuberantly exuberant Dick Vitale, resulting in a virtual buffet of\nexuberance.\n\nUnfortunately, in 1992, Valvano received a dire cancer diagnosis. The next\nyear, in 1993, Valvano passed away, but not before he made the following\nmemorable speech at the 1993 ESPY Awards:\n\nAs you can see, in that speech, Coach V uttered the words, \"don't give up,\ndon't ever give up,\" which became the motto for the then newly-formed V\nFoundation. Fast forward to 2020 and the Foundation has already provided over\n$250 million in grants for cancer research with ESPN helping raise $116\nmillion of this. Indeed, ESPN and the V Foundation certainly didn\u2019t give up on\nfundraising.\n\nScott certainly uttered his share of memorable phrases as well. In fact, he\nand his legendary catchphrases were a key reason why ESPN was able to reach\nwhole new segments of audiences in 1990\u2019s: bringing in younger and more\ndiverse audiences that other networks and sports programming at the time\nweren\u2019t quite reaching.\n\nSoon after he joined ESPN in 1993, Scott became a fixture as an anchor for\nESPN\u2019s flagship program\n__[_Sportscenter_](http://www.espn.com/video/sportscenter\n\"http://www.espn.com/video/sportscenter\"). And it quickly became apparent that\nScott was \u201ccool as the other side of the pillow,\u201d in the words of another of\nhis catchphrases. Scott became one of the first racial minorities to hold such\na prominent sports broadcasting role. He also made broadcasts more fun and\nrelate-able to younger generations and a broader audience. How could you not\nenjoy punny phrases such as \"he must be the bus driver cuz he was takin' him\nto school,\" and \"just call him butter 'cause he's on a roll.\" Of course, while\ngood puns are like eggs in a reinforced safe, nothing can really beat them,\nScott did also weave expert and insightful analysis into his broadcasts in\nways that really connected with audiences.\n\nThat\u2019s why Scott\u2019s battle with cancer and eventual passing in 2015 shook ESPN\nand the sports world and left him linked to the V Foundation efforts. Colborne\nsaid that two new Scott-related initiatives helped ESPN and the V Foundation\nsurpass its previous high-water mark for fundraising. One of them was Stuart\nScott Day on December 4, which raised $333,000 for the [Stuart Scott Memorial\nCancer Research Fund](https://www.jimmyv.org/research/stuart-scott-memorial-\ncancer-research-fund/ \"https://www.jimmyv.org/research/stuart-scott-memorial-\ncancer-research-fund/\"). This fund supports research into why minority\npopulations continue to face higher rates of getting and dying from various\ncancers. Over a $100,000 came from sales of a special, limited edition Stuart\nScott \u201cBoo-Yah\u201d t-shirt. Who knows? In the future, maybe there will be a \u201ccool\nas the other side of the pillow\u201d Stuart Scott pillowcase.\n\nAnother new Scott-related initiative was the inception of a partnership with\nthe UFC ([Ultimate Fighting Championship](https://www.ufc.com/\n\"https://www.ufc.com/\")). According to Colborne, Scott was a \u201cbig MMA [mixed\nmartial arts] fan. The UFC includes those have undergone and dealt with cancer\nbattles themselves. The partnership connects a new demographic and audience to\nthe V Foundation efforts and funding cancer research.\u201d As the following video\nshows, one product of this partnership has been the \u201c[UFC Fight Like Hell\nNight](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/28153329/ufc-\nfight-hell-night-celebrates-stuart-scott \"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-\nbasketball/story/_/id/28153329/ufc-fight-hell-night-celebrates-stuart-scott\")\u201d\nin memory of Scott:\n\nThe video provides a brief window into some of what ESPN brings to the ring in\nthe fight against cancer. As Colburne related, \u201cESPN is one of the best in the\nbusiness when it comes to storytelling. Story telling helps humanize everyone\nand communicates important messages about how everyone is somehow affected by\ncancer.\u201d Case in point, the video shows some of the toughest MMA fighters in\nthe world appearing quite vulnerable when talking about the impact of cancer.\n\nThis is just the latest example of ESPN\u2019s ability to link new segments of\npeople, new demographics to the fight against cancer. Even though cancer\neventually touches everyone because it so common and often so deadly, those\nwho are young and healthy may not yet fully realize the horrendous impact of\ncancer. With cancer being such a difficult foe, involving all segments of\nsociety in the fight is important. Reaching new demographics does require\ndifferent and often innovative approaches, as Colborne explained, such as\nworking with multi-platinum selling pop artist Andy Grammer. Grammer, who lost\nhis mother to cancer, lent his song \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up on Me\u201d to a [V Week public\nservice\nannouncement](https://vimeo.com/user18060468/review/375684552/1afcb3d573\n\"https://vimeo.com/user18060468/review/375684552/1afcb3d573\").\n\n![CNN Heroes - Show](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1192953926/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nAndy Grammer contributed a song to ESPN's cancer research fundraising efforts.\n(Photo by Mike ... [+] Coppola/Getty Images for WarnerMedia)\n\nGetty Images for WarnerMedia\n\nESPN\u2019s unique reach throughout the sports world allows them to readily do\nthings like the \u201c[Kicks to Beat\nCancer](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28189958/kicks-beat-cancer-back-v-\nweek \"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28189958/kicks-beat-cancer-back-v-\nweek\")\u201d initiative. This initiative, in its second year, has had athletes\ndonate game-worn and signed sneakers to help raise funds. According to\nColborne, \u201cathletes who donated include Damian Lillard, Magic Johnson, Alex\nMorgan, Carli Lloyd, and Lindsey Vonn.\u201d While this initiative may not be the\nbiggest fundraiser for the V Foundation, it does raise cancer awareness among\nsports fans by connecting household names (and ski household names) with the\ncause.\n\nSpeaking of household names, two of ESPN\u2019s prominent personalities recently\njoined the [V Foundation\u2019s Board of\nDirectors](https://www.v.org/about/leadership/\n\"https://www.v.org/about/leadership/\"). One is [Sage\nSteele](https://espnpressroom.com/us/bios/steele_sage/\n\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/bios/steele_sage/\"), co-host of _ESPN\u2019s\nSportscenter_. \u201cWhen I tell people about my joining the Board, people's eyes\nget big,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to explain what the V Foundation\nmeans. They go back to the speech by Jimmy V. Go to Stuart Scott. Go to [Robin\nRoberts](https://www.biography.com/personality/robin-roberts\n\"https://www.biography.com/personality/robin-roberts\").\u201d Roberts is the former\nESPN sportscaster and current _Good Morning America_ anchor who has survived\ncancer.\n\nSteele also indicated that her involvement is deeply personal: \u201cMy father has\nbeen battling two kinds of cancers.\u201d\n\n![Jay Bilas](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e38f77ea854780006b06337/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nJay Bilas, seen here on ESPN's College GameDay, joined Steele as new members\nof the V Foundation ... [+] Board. (Photo: Courtesy of ESPN)\n\n2020, ESPN Inc.\n\nThe other new Board member from ESPN is [Jay\nBilas](https://espnpressroom.com/us/bios/bilas_jay/\n\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/bios/bilas_jay/\"), a longtime ESPN basketball\nanalyst and a starter for the Duke Blue Devils basketball team that made it to\nthe NCAA Championship in 1986. Bilas\u2019s voice has become so synonymous with\ncollege basketball that when he is talking about something else besides\nbasketball, you half expect a game to suddenly begin. Bilas said that the work\nof ESPN and V Foundation shows how \u201cthe world of sports goes well beyond\ncompetition. It can be an engine for social change.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cit is an honor and privileged to be involved with the V\nFoundation as a Board Member, because of how personal cancer is to so many\npeople. I recall attending a cancer fundraiser during which they said \u2018all\nthose who are currently fighting cancer, please stand.\u2019 Then they proceeded to\nask everyone who had a direct family member and then a friend who was fighting\ncancer to stand. It only took maybe three or four questions until the entire\nroom was standing.\u201d\n\nBoth Bilas and Steele were colleagues of Scott. \u201cStuart (Scott) was a very\nclose personal friend, a mentor as well,\u201d Steele reminisced. \u201cHe was one the\npeople who had my back.\u201d\n\nSteele pointed out that Scott, \u201cwas never defined by his diagnosis. That\u2019s why\nhe never got a prognosis from his doctors. He never allowed anyone to tell him\nhow months he had to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you die from cancer doesn\u2019t mean that you lost the fight,\u201d Bilas\nemphasized. \u201cThe ultimate outcome doesn't characterize the fight. Just because\nyou passed away doesn't mean that cancer won.\u201d\n\nSteele recalled, \u201cThe last time I saw [Scott], he was suffering so much but\nstill had a positive attitude. I asked him, \u2018how do you keep smiling?\u2019 He\nresponded that \u2018happiness is a choice.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith this new V Week fundraising record, Steele felt that \u201c[Scott] would\nprobably be smiling and enjoying all the attention.\u201d And maybe, just maybe,\nhe\u2019d also utter a \u201cboo-yah.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bruce_y_lee) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruce-y-lee-68a6834/).
