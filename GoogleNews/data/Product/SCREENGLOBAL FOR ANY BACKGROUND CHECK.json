forces with JP Morgan AM to expand its sustainable ETF\nproducts\n\n![](https://expertinvestoreurope.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/5/2019/10/governmentbond-553x311.jpg)\n\n![](https://expertinvestoreurope.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/5/2019/10/governmentbond.jpg)\n\n__\n\nUBS Asset Management (UBS AM) has added an exchange traded fund (ETF) to its\nrange, which it claims is the first to screen global sovereign issuers on\nsustainability criteria.\n\nClemens Reuter, head of global UBS passive and ETF investments specialists,\nsaid: \u201cUBS ETFs is the first mover in launching this new product that fills an\nimportant gap in the global government bond universe with a dedicated\nsustainability-focused ETF.\u201d\n\nThe UBS ETF (LU) JP Morgan Global Government ESG Liquid Bond Ucits ETF tracks\nthe JP Morgan Global Government ESG Liquid Bond Index (Total Return), which is\nexposed to liquid global government bonds based on market capitalisation, and\nscreens sovereigns that do not score adequately on ESG rating criteria.\n\nThe parent of the total return bond index is the JP Morgan GBI Aggregate\nDiversified Index.\n\n###  **Best to worst**\n\nAndrew Walsh, head of passive and ETF specialist sales for UK and Ireland at\nUBS AM, told _Expert Investor_ : \u201cThe screening process takes a mix of\nqualitative and quantitative factors according to Sustainalytics and RepRisk\nmethodologies [into account].\n\n\"For the developed market, countries\u2019 ESG rankings are scored in 10 bands:\nfrom one (best) to 10 (worst).\n\n\"All countries in the lower half are removed. For the emerging markets,\nsmaller countries, with an overall weight of less than 0.25%, are removed.\nThen, all countries with an ESG score of six to 10 are removed from the\nindex.\u201d\n\nThe underlying exposure is diversified across more than 20 sovereign issuers,\na spokesperson said in the statement.\n\n###  **Background**\n\nFrom the period August 2014 to August 2019, the JP Morgan Global Government\nESG Liquid Bond Index showed a tracking error of 0.35%, a tracking difference\nof 9 basis points, and a 0.998 daily return correlation compared to the\nstandard non-ESG index, UBS said.\n\nUBS AM, with $858bn (\u20ac774bn) invested assets, offers about a third of all ETFs\nin the European market as of end-September 2019, it said.\n\nThe ETF is available on European exchanges, including the German stock\nexchange platform Xetra, Italy\u2019s stock exchange Borsa Italiana and Six Swiss\nExchange.\n\n\n\n![](http://ei.cms-lastwordmedia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/5/2019/10/UBSETF_pic.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexpertinvestoreurope.com%2Fubs-\nunveils-government-bond-sustainable-\netf%2F&linkname=UBS%20unveils%20government%20bond%20sustainable%20ETF\n\"Email\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexpertinvestoreurope.com%2Fubs-\nunveils-government-bond-sustainable-\netf%2F&linkname=UBS%20unveils%20government%20bond%20sustainable%20ETF\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexpertinvestoreurope.com%2Fubs-\nunveils-government-bond-sustainable-\netf%2F&linkname=UBS%20unveils%20government%20bond%20sustainable%20ETF\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fexpertinvestoreurope.com%2Fubs-\nunveils-government-bond-sustainable-\netf%2F&linkname=UBS%20unveils%20government%20bond%20sustainable%20ETF\n\"Twitter\")\n\n[\n](mailto:?subject=Share:%20UBS%20unveils%20government%20bond%20sustainable%20ETF&body=The%20firm%20has%20joined%20forces%20with%20JP%20Morgan%20AM%20to%20expand%20its%20sustainable%20ETF%20products%0D%0A%0D%0AShared%20from%20https://expertinvestoreurope.com/ubs-\nunveils-government-bond-sustainable-etf/%0D%0A)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n###

The Chinese period epic\nstars Matt Damon as a mercenary who must lead soldiers guarding the Great Wall\nof China against a horde of fantastical monsters. It\u2019s the most high-profile\nattempt to date of a Chinese-financed film trying to break through the\nAmerican box office. Plenty of Hollywood blockbusters do crazy amounts of\nbusiness in what is now the [second-biggest movie marketplace in the\nworld](https://www.inverse.com/article/11515-china-s-movie-market-just-set-\nthe-one-week-box-office-record). But the opposite rarely happens.\n\nSo to ease you into the big-screen global spectacle, here are a handful of\nChinese epics to watch before _The Great Wall_.\n\n![](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/1/17/8a40da51-497d-472d-a6a5-70aae3d08a37-divider-1.svg?w=349&h=44.74358974358974&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&fit=max&crop=faces)\n\n## 7\\. _A Touch of Zen_\n\nThe grandfather of all big-budget contemporary Chinese cinema, King Hu\u2019s _A\nTouch of Zen_ is a throwback wuxia dream. The epic spiritual quest focuses on\nYang (Hsu Feng) a fugitive noblewoman who goes into exile in a small village\nbut whose identity is uncovered by a rogue swordsman. Cue: Yang and a few\nfellow travelers fending off hordes of sword-wielding bad guys.\n\nWhile the movie preceded the scale of historical dramas that came after it, _A\nTouch of Zen_ is also kind of bittersweet. The Hollywood influence on Chinese\ncinema guarantees they won\u2019t make them like this anymore.\n\n## 6\\. _Curse of the Golden Flower_\n\nZhang Yimou is right at home telling melodramatic stories about emperors,\nprincesses, and hundreds of thousand of loyal troops willing to do their\nbidding. The operative word here is \u201cextravagance,\u201d and for the most part,\nZhang knows what to do with it.\n\nSet during the Tang Dynasty in 928 A.D., the movie luxuriates in the\nShakespearean machinations of a brutish ruler (Chow Yun-Fat) attempting to\nundermine his taciturn yet cunning wife (Gong Li). The backstabbing would be\nsoap opera-worthy if it weren\u2019t for the assured scope of Zhang\u2019s excess.\n\n## 5\\. _Red Cliff_\n\nFollowing a series of Hollywood films in the mid- to late-1990s like\n_Face/Off_ and _Mission: Impossible II_ , John Woo returned to his homeland to\ndirect this historical drama. Starring Hong Kong idol Tony Leung, it was Woo\u2019s\nfirst Chinese-language film since bona fide action classic _Hard Boiled_ in\n1992 (also starring Leung).\n\nThe movie essentially uses the crumbling of the third-century Han Dynasty as a\nbackdrop for Woo\u2019s signature brand of visceral, spectacular choreography. With\na nearly five-hour runtime, Woo revels in the simple premise of an outnumbered\ngroup of good guys stopping at nothing to defeat a drastically larger force of\nbad guys. Whether he\u2019s filming a cop shooting a gun or an ancient warrior\nswinging a sword, Woo\u2019s work remains unrivaled but highly influential.\n\n## 4\\. _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_\n\nNo film better represents the contemporary bridge between the Chinese and\nAmerican entertainment industries than Ang Lee\u2019s 2000 kung fu drama. As one of\nthe most influential foreign language films ever made, the international\nsuccess of _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ had a long-term effect on\nHollywood.\n\nIt boosted the popularity of a handful of aspects of Chinese cinema, like how\nthe little known [wuxia genre](https://www.inverse.com/article/12758-the-\nphysics-of-martial-arts-in-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-explained) became a\nsudden action touchstone. It also opened the door for Chinese and Asian actors\nto appear in more Hollywood projects in general.\n\n## 3\\. _Monster Hunt_\n\n[Raman Hui\u2019s 2016 fable](https://www.inverse.com/article/10699-how-the-\ndirector-of-monster-hunt-brought-china-s-biggest-hit-to-america) about a lowly\npeasant befriending a benevolent vegetable monster in a fictional ancient\nChina became the highest grossing film in the country\u2019s history at the time.\n\nThe peasant\u2019s martial arts-riddled, musical quest to protect the little veggie\nsprout became popular by mixing adult humor and cuddly animated designs. The\nabsurd premise made for expensive four-quadrant filmmaking at its most\nfantastic, but it didn\u2019t really break through stateside. It did, however,\nprovide a perfect example of what Chinese filmmakers adopting American\nblockbuster techniques in their own context would be like.\n\n## 2\\. _Dragon Blade_\n\nYou won\u2019t hear [_Dragon Blade_](https://www.inverse.com/article/4165-does-\ndragon-blade-really-look-that-bad) bandied about as one of the best Chinese\nepics ever made, but it\u2019s a prime example of China\u2019s attempt to push into the\nHollywood market. If anything, it satisfies the very niche urge to see what a\nJohn Cusack, Adrien Brody, and Jackie Chan sword fight would be like.\n\nChan plays Huo An, a military captain in 50 B.C. who attempts to maintain\npeace between 36 nations that use the legendary Silk Road as a key trade\nroute. Cusack and Brody play sniveling Roman villains who want it for\nthemselves. The movie does feature elaborate production design, large-scale\nbattle sequences, and a great stylistic blend of Hollywood and East Asian\ncinema. But it\u2019s also cheesy as hell.\n\n## 1\\. _Hero_\n\nYou won\u2019t find any monsters in _Hero_ , but you will find the most distilled\nversion of Zhang Yimou\u2019s epic wuxia aesthetic before _The Great Wall_. The\nmartial arts extravaganza centers on a folkloric framework told from several\ndifferent points of view. A nameless warrior actually called Nameless (Jet Li)\ncomes to the court of a beleaguered king who is trying to unify his land.\nThree notorious assassins \u2014 Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie\nCheung), and Long Sky (Donnie Yen) \u2014 vow to kill him. But Nameless recounts to\nthe king how he has killed all three and hopes to collect a reward.\n\nThe scope of the film is enormous. _Hero_ is the most expensive film in\nChinese history, and it shows. The best place for Zhang to go from there in\nthis kind of epic framework was global. He conquered the Chinese box office\nwith a handful of the most high-profile Chinese movie stars, and over a decade\nlater, he\u2019s now attempting to break through with Hollywood stars too.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [Movies](/topic/movies)\n\nShare:\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inverse.com%2Farticle%2F27959-the-\ngreat-wall-matt-damon-chinese-cinema-wuxia-monsters-zhang-yimou-john-woo-ang-\nlee%3Futm_term%3Dshare\n\"Share\")[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inverse.com%2Farticle%2F27959-the-\ngreat-wall-matt-damon-chinese-cinema-wuxia-monsters-zhang-yimou-john-woo-ang-\nlee&via=inversedotcom \"Tweet\")[](https://www.inverse.com/article/27959-the-\ngreat-wall-matt-damon-chinese-cinema-wuxia-monsters-zhang-yimou-john-woo-ang-\nlee)[](mailto:?to=&subject=Check%20out%20this%20cool%20story%20on%20Inverse!&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inverse.com%2Farticle%2F27959-the-\ngreat-wall-matt-damon-chinese-cinema-wuxia-monsters-zhang-yimou-john-woo-ang-\nlee \"Send via email\")\n\n### More like this\n\n[Entertainment3.28.2020 6:00\nPM![](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/3/27/63e189ce-b0c9-40a9-922d-da4abd0873b8-screen-\nshot-2020-03-27-at-34823-pm.png?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70)\n\n## What's the correct 'Fast & Furious' watch order?
