* *\n\nTraditional analytics have been helping businesses by informing them about the\nlatest trends, which they use to take measures to develop strategies for\ngrowth. But in reality, what these organizations are doing is not developing\nanalytics solutions. Instead, they are just governing it. Today data-driven\nanalytics is all about asking the right questions and getting the relevant\nanswers - all while exploring the potential of data.\n\n### What Is Autonomous Analytics?\n\nThe words autonomous analytics do not merely mean a combination of artificial\nintelligence (AI) and automation. Autonomous analytics is the application of\nmachine learning (ML) to enhance and make human judgements. This gives\nbusinesses many opportunities to improve their decision making and predictive\nabilities as the data becomes more complicated.\n\nIt is a fact that ML is the key to autonomous analytics. Still, it does not\ninvolve writing millions of lines of code with several business rules\nhardcoded in them to make it more complicated and expensive to maintain. What\nautonomous analytics brings to the table is the ability to self-learn\nalgorithms that get better with the growing volume of data. What is more,\nthese algorithms modify themselves as more data comes in along with more\nevaluated actions.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n![W3Schools](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n](http://www.jigsawacademy.com/lpinsta/IPBA_2019?utm_source=AIM&utm_medium=in_article_banner&utm_campaign=Banner)\n\n* * *\n\n### How Is Autonomous Analytics Helping?\n\nAutonomous analytics is adaptive as well. The main thing for a system is to\nunderstand the context of the business - what it is, where it is, and what it\nneeds to know. Usually, the business analytics value chain starts with the\ndiscovery of data, and then moves on to preparing and augmenting it. The next\nsteps involve analysis, modelling and finally, prediction. Autonomous\nanalytics becomes adaptive and autonomous by applying ML to this value chain.\n\nAlso Read  India\u2019s Tryst With Mobility Revolution & Urban Planning Using\nAI](https://analyticsindiamag.com/indias-tryst-with-mobility-revolution-urban-\nplanning-using-artificial-intelligence/)\n\nWhen it comes to discovering data and preparation stages, autonomous analytics\ninvolves finding useful datasets across many sources. This involves\nunderstanding which datasets can be accessed and what their quality is. It\nalso includes receiving automated recommendations for data standardization,\ncleansing, and enrichment.\n\nWhen it comes to visualization, autonomous analytics helps automatically\ngenerate insights. Rather than starting on a blank canvas, one can have\nautomatically generated insights which are based on correlations and patterns\nin the data that the systems identify. This speeds up analysis and delivers\nquick real-time insights.\n\nAlong with helping the business analytics value chain, autonomous analytics\nsystems help in answering the most critical questions when it comes to\nbusiness intelligence and analytics: 'What happened', 'Why it happened', and\n'What will happen.' Human workers who drive today's business visual tools tell\norganizations' what happened' but not 'why it happened and 'what could happen\nnext'. The current need for data science and analytics is to ask and know the\nanswers to all three questions.\n\nAutonomous analytics uses 'Active Seek' bots as a solution. These bots will\nseek answers to the questions the organizations need, along with evolving and\ngaining the ability to perform and answer all three questions. They use\nsomething called attribution analysis to answer questions about 'why things\nhappened' and use predictive analysis to know 'what will happen next'. Getting\npredictions about 'what will happen' is critical. It helps businesses\nunderstand performance and also take measures as they operationalize the\npredictions.\n\n### Outlook\n\nWhat the current generation of businesses need is the ability to generate\nbusiness insights at high speed. Generating these high-speed insights not only\nreduces the load on humans and accelerates the value chain, but also helps\nlower costs, reduce risks and get high-end predictive insights. Autonomous\nanalytics promises all those things. Services like [Oracle Autonomous\nAnalytics](https://blogs.oracle.com/analyticscloud/experience-oracle-\nautonomous-analytics-cloud) are already aiming for that. Autonomous analytics\nprovides insights on every decision wherever it matters, at the right time and\nin context. It is then, safe to say that it may be the key to the future of\nanalytics.\n\nAlso Read  Moving Deep Learning From Test To Production With New\nTechniques](https://analyticsindiamag.com/moving-deep-learning-test-\nproduction-new-techniques/)\n\n* * *\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://t.me/joinchat/NJLxnhZB7GkX3CPvjs9QGQ)\n\n### Provide your comments below\n\ncomments\n\nTags [Autonomous analytics](https://analyticsindiamag.com/tag/autonomous-\nanalytics/)\n\n[![Sameer Balaganur](https://mk0analyticsindf35n9.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/authors/sameer.balaganur@analyticsindiamag.com-261.jpg)](https://analyticsindiamag.com/author/sameer-\nbalaganuranalyticsindiamag-com/)\n\n##### [Sameer Balaganur](https://analyticsindiamag.com/author/sameer-\nbalaganuranalyticsindiamag-com/)\n\nSameer is an aspiring Content Writer.

(KOLD News 13) - OH Predictive Insights\n[asked](//dropbox.com/s/29rnfjb01143k1h/Coronavirus%20Topline%20with%20sample%20summary.pdf?dl=0)\none thousand people from the general population about their opinion regarding\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe survey was conducted on March 26th through March 31st, 2020.\n\n###  _**Concern Perspectives**_\n\nWhen asked about their concern of the coronavirus issue, 2 in 3 respondents\nsay the situation will become worse in the next 30 days. The concern level\nsplit in generation, ethnicity and household income.\n\nNearly 3 in 4 Boomers and generation X believe the situation will become\nsomewhat worse or even much worse in the next 30 days, while the Millennial,\nnon-whites and the lower income groups are more optimistic than others.\n\nThe top three perspectives that Arizonans are most concerned about the\nCoronavirus impact are:\n\n1\\. Economic perspective (87%)\n\n2\\. Health perspective (79%)\n\n3\\. Public safety perspective (78%).\n\n###  _**Behavioral Changes**_\n\nOver 90 percent of Arizonans surveyed said they are avoiding public\ngatherings, avoiding restaurants and are using hand sanitizer or washing their\nhands more often as a result of the Coronavirus. No matter whether people\nthink the situation will become better, worse or remain the same, over 90\npercent of them are using hand sanitizer or washing their hands more often.\n\nAlso, 81 percent of respondents said they cancelled their vacation travel due\nto the pandemic, which means still 1 in 5 Arizonans decided to still follow\ntheir travel plans in spite of the pandemic. While Boomers and whites say they\navoid public gatherings most (95%), they cancelled their vacation travel the\nleast (78%) which was surprising. In contrast, millennials and generation Z\nare avoiding public gatherings the least (86%) but they cancelled their\nvacation plans most (84%).\n\n###  _**Government/Politician Confidence**_\n\n**National:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has the highest\nconfidence from Arizonans with 69% of total confident and 13% of total non-\nconfident. While President Donald Trump has 41% total confident and 45% total\nnon-confident and the United States Congress has 31% total confident and 39%\ntotal non-confident.\n\n**State-wise:** Arizona Department of Health Services (AZ-DHS) has the highest\nconfidence from Arizonans with 57% of total confident and 15% of total non-\nconfident. 44% of Arizonans have confidence in Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and\n38% of Arizonans have confidence in the Arizona State Legislature. About 1 in\n3 respondents have a neutral opinion of Ducey and the State Legislature. Ducey\nhas a net-confidence of positive 18-points and the State Legislature has a\nnet-confidence of positive 8-points.\n\nThe total confidence drops as the age decreases in all of the asked questions.\n\n###  _**Purchase Plan**_\n\nTop 5 item that Arizonans intend to purchase in the next 30 days:\n\n1\\. Food (91%)\n\n2\\. Household supplies (70%)\n\n3\\. Beauty/Personal care (36%)\n\n4\\. Medical/Healthcare (28%)\n\n5\\. Streaming entertainment/Home improvement supplies (19%)\n\n\u201cThe health messages to combat the spread of COVID-19 have clearly been\nresonating among Arizonans based on the results of the behavioral questions\nasked in our survey,\u201d said Mike Noble, Chief of Research and Managing Partner\nof Phoenix-based market research and public opinion polling company OH\nPredictive Insights. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of this pandemic and currently\nthe public remains confident in Arizona\u2019s leadership even though a majority\nbelieve things will get worse before they get better in the next month.\u201d\n\n_Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13.

U.S. health and tech leaders\nin The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy want qualified data\nscientists to mine terabytes of available research data on\n[COVID-19](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-pandemic-\ncovid-19-latest-news-2020-04-07/).\n\n###  Featured stories\n\n  * [What data tells us about first responders dealing with COVID-19 cases](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-data-tells-us-about-first-responders-dealing-with-covid-19-cases/)\n  * [iPad Pro 2020 hands-on: Faster, more powerful, and the trackpad changes everything](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-pro-2020-12-9-inch/)\n  * [Upskill: ZDNet Academy offers training bundle deals for IT pros, developers, and more](https://www.zdnet.com/article/upskill-zdnet-academy-offers-training-bundle-deals-for-it-pros-developers-and-more/)\n  * [Here's how you can still get a free Windows 10 upgrade](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/)\n\nTo give scientists easy access to the research, a database has been uploaded\nto a centralized hub named [The COVID-19 Open Research\nDataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research).\n\nIt's an opportunity for service for data scientists, a way to help healthcare\nworkers and policymakers understand a growing dataset that holds the key to\nmaking informed decisions. At the moment, we lack the most basic knowledge\nabout COVID-19, including an answer to the most fundamental question: how many\npeople have been infected? Health experts agree that reliable data answering\nthis question and other fundamental questions are needed to guide difficult\ndecisions ahead.\n\n **What role do data scientists have to play in the response to the\npandemic?**\n\nTo answer that question I reached out to Gordon McDonald, CEO of\n[Capice](https://capice.ai/), a Florida-based team of AI experts whose tools\nand deep learning network are used by corporate clients to quickly train their\nmodels and generate predictive insights into things like customer buying\nhabits, product pricing, and employee attrition. After the White House call,\nMcDonald decided to temporarily divert his company's expertise and resources\nto helping with the COVID-19 data.\n\n\"The good news is we have lots of data,\" says McDonald. \"The bad news is the\norganization and accessibility of that data is very spread out or difficult to\naccess.\"\n\nGiven the difficulties with the dataset, McDonald points to [AI deep\nlearning](https://www.cnet.com/tags/artificial-intelligence/) as a necessary\ntool.\n\n\"[Deep Learning](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-deep-learning-\neverything-you-need-to-know/) is not a typical algorithm. A user literally\n\"teaches\" the platform with hundreds of examples of the various\nclassifications or predictions. Once taught, then future classifications and\npredictions are in the hands of the deep learning platform.\"\n\nThis can be applied to health data in general, which is a growing trend in\ndata-driven medicine.\n\n\"Does this CAT scan report any issues in any scan frame?\" McDonald asks by way\nof example. \"Listen to audio and find instances of sleep apnea. Predict the\npatients quality of life as good, medium, issues after they have an upcoming\nsurgery.\"\n\n **What progress, if any, has been made so far? How might the effort evolve in\nthe next weeks or months?**\n\n\"There is at least one company, [engine.is](http://engine.is/), attempting to\nlink data science researchers with data with technology,\" says McDonald. \"I\nhave offered my company's full services to that effort. But all Deep Learning\nstarts with data and data is what we need. I am aware of [one COVID-19 data\nset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) that has been\npublished for others to use.\"\n\nMore coordination is necessary, McDonald points out. Out of this pandemic,\nit's possible there will emerge a new framework out of which to deploy data\nscientists as first-responders to meet urgent and developing problems like\npandemics. Until then, the ad hoc response is the best we have.\n\n###  Coronavirus Updates\n\n  * [Latest News from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n  * [Critical IT policies and tools (TechRepublic)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/snake-oil-salesmen-warning-doj-ftc-crack-down-on-fake-coronavirus-products/)\n  * [Data scientists, your country needs you know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/data-scientists-white-house-issues-a-call-to-arms/)\n  * [What data tells us about first responders](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-data-tells-us-about-first-responders-dealing-with-covid-19-cases/)\n  * [Windows 10 PowerShell script lets you securely fight coronavirus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-this-windows-10-powershell-script-lets-you-securely-fight-coronavirus-with-foldinghome/)\n  * [AI confronts a big data problem in COVID-19 diagnosis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-runs-smack-up-against-a-big-data-problem-in-covid-19-diagnosis/)\n  * [Roundup: Cyber-security during the pandemic](https://www.zdnet.com/article/roundup-the-coronavirus-pandemic-delivers-an-array-of-cyber-security-challenges/)\n  * [Vicious COVID-19 malware destroys your PC for sport, not profit](https://www.zdnet.com/article/theres-now-covid-19-malware-that-will-wipe-your-pc-and-rewrite-your-mbr/)\n  * [India's chance to become manufacturing alternative to China](https://www.zdnet.com/article/covid-19-spells-chance-for-india-to-become-manufacturing-alternative-to-china/)\n  * [South Korea mulls electronic wristband to enforce quarantine](https://www.zdnet.com/article/south-korea-considers-electronic-wristband-to-enforce-covid-19-quarantine/)\n  * [Apple and Tesla reveal new products to fight COVID-19](https://www.zdnet.com/article/coronavirus-apple-and-tesla-reveal-the-new-products-theyre-making-in-covid-19-fight/)\n  * [WhatsApp tries to slow coronavirus misinformation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/whatsapp-makes-it-harder-for-you-to-forward-some-messages-as-it-tries-to-slow-coronavirus-misinformation/)\n  * [COVID-19 mapped: Azure-powered tool IDs most vulnerable populations](https://www.zdnet.com/article/azure-powered-covid-vulnerability-map/)\n  * [Dashboard delivers real-time view of virus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-track-the-coronavirus-dashboard-delivers-real-time-view-of-the-deadly-virus/)\n  * [It's the end of tech events as we know them](https://www.zdnet.com/article/coronavirus-will-end-tech-conferences-and-events-as-we-know-them/)\n  * [Recovering our tech economy after COVID-19](https://www.zdnet.com/article/states-of-shock-part-2-recovering-our-tech-economy-after-covid-19/)\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ Artificial Intelligence ](/topic/artificial-intelligence/) [ Digital\nTransformation ](/topic/digital-transformation/) [ Robotics\n](/topic/robotics/) [ Internet of Things ](/topic/internet-of-things/) [\nInnovation ](/topic/innovation/) [ Enterprise Software ](/topic/enterprise-\nsoftware/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Greg\nNichols](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/12/0b8d1515-8d76-4352-97c3-f9ea4171b48d/thumbnail/40x40/d833f0fd205f6623a11fc8b84ccc4fd6/greg.jpg)\n](/meet-the-team/us/me51/)\n\nBy [ Greg Nichols ](/meet-the-team/us/me51/) | April 7, 2020 -- 11:00 GMT\n(19:00 GMT+08:00) | Topic: [Coronavirus: Business and technology in a\npandemic](/topic/coronavirus-business-and-technology-in-a-pandemic/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

Personalized product recommendations help companies to\nincrease average order value. Thus, to meet the evolving needs of customers\nfor updated products, companies are investing heavily in new technologies to\noffer best product recommendations. AutoML solutions find patterns in customer\nbehavior from clickstream data, prior purchases, demographics, browsing\nhistory, and previous product searches, and create 1:1 personalized product\nrecommendation list that matches consumer needs and preferences.\n\nThe rising importance of effective product assortment in retail store network\nis expected to generate immense opportunities in the automated machine\nlearning market. Choosing the right mix of products in a retail store is very\nimportant for retailers in order to meet the needs of customers and retain\ncustomer base. AutoML solutions can be ideal for retailers for effective\nproduct assortment. The solution can look at various factors, such as\nlocation, customer segments, weather patterns, store display space, and past\nsales records, to find out which products would be the best fit for a given\nstore location.\n\nTogether, North America and Europe are expected to hold over 65% share\ncumulatively in the automated machine learning market in 2030. All the major\ninvestments are being recorded in the U.S., Canada, Germany, U.K., and France.\nFurther, technological advancement, developed IT infrastructure, and\nincreasing adoption of emerging technologies are some of the key factors\ndriving the growth of the market in the regions.\n\nAPAC is expected to register fastest growth in the market during the forecast\nperiod. This can be attributed to the rising economic growth, increasing\ninvestment in IT infrastructure, significant adoption of emerging\ntechnologies, and increasing government initiatives toward the development of\nartificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\n **Companies Mentioned**\n\n  * DataRobot Inc.\n  * H2O.ai Inc.\n  * dotData Inc.\n  * EdgeVerve Systems Limited\n  * Amazon Web Services Inc.\n  * Squark\n  * Big Squid Inc.\n  * SAS Institute Inc.\n  * Microsoft Corporation\n  * Determined AI\n\n **Key Topics Covered:**\n\n **1\\.

patent-pending, machine learning technology will help digital teams\nmake big product bets faster**_\n\n[Amplitude](http://amplitude.com), the leader in product intelligence,\nannounced that it has acquired ClearBrain, a predictive analytics startup.\n\nThis is Amplitude\u2019s first acquisition, and with it, customers will be able to\ninstantly predict which features, campaigns and product bets are most likely\nto drive revenue growth without extensive A/B testing. In addition to\nintegrating ClearBrain\u2019s technology, Amplitude will be adding ClearBrain\u2019s\nworld-class product and engineering team to its machine learning division,\nwhich will be led by ClearBrain CEO [Bilal\nMahmood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbmahmood/). Terms of the deal are not\nbeing disclosed.\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [Kount Named to Fast Company\u2019s Annual List of\nthe World\u2019s Most Innovative\nCompanies](https://martechseries.com/analytics/data-management-\nplatforms/privacy-and-regulations/kount-named-fast-companys-annual-list-\nworlds-innovative-companies/)\n\n\u201cAmplitude works with leading digital teams which know that in today\u2019s\ncompetitive marketplace, the best product experience wins. Our customers use\nproduct intelligence to iterate quickly on big bets, and they need instant\nclarity on what features their users are coming back to use and which\ncampaigns drive the most engagement \u2014 that\u2019s why predictive analytics\nmatters,\u201d Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates said. \u201cMost predictive analytics\nsolutions offered to companies today, however, are misleading and dangerous to\nrely on because they present correlation as causation. What the ClearBrain\nteam has developed is years ahead of the market. They have built a self-serve,\nmachine learning platform that provides predictive insights with clear\ncausation out of the box.\u201d\n\nThe ability to differentiate between causation and correlation has been the\nholy grail of analytics for product managers for decades and has traditionally\nonly been possible through time-intensive A/B tests. The ClearBrain team\nexperienced this firsthand as the founding engineers at Optimizely and Google\nAds, and it inspired them to build a machine learning platform that could\nsimulate thousands of these tests in parallel. As SVP of Engineering Shadi\nRostami said in the Amplitude blog post announcing the acquisition,\nintegrating this patent-pending technology into Amplitude will enable\ncustomers to forecast any product action and differentiate causal versus\ncorrelated conversion drivers in seconds.\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [DisruptOps Raises $9 Million Series A to\nScale Cloud Security Operations](https://martechseries.com/analytics/data-\nmanagement-platforms/privacy-and-regulations/disruptops-raises-9-million-\nseries-scale-cloud-security-operations/)\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to bring predictive analytics to thousands of Amplitude\u2019s\ncustomers is an amazing proposition for us,\u201d ClearBrain CEO and Founder [Bilal\nMahmood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbmahmood/) said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly rare to\nfind such strong alignment in culture and vision as we have with Amplitude.\u201d\n\nAmplitude has continued to grow its business rapidly with a strong start in\n2020. In the past few weeks, the company has\n\n  * added over 2.5 trillion new user actions to its proprietary behavioral database, Nova, from thousands of products around the world.\n  * continued to grow its customer portfolio with market leaders in SaaS, consumer marketplaces, and others as well as landed a global Fortune 100 financial service business.\n  * released over 12 new features and improvements to the Amplitude platform including a bi-directional integration with leading customer messaging platform Intercom, a data ingestion solution for marketing cloud customers, conversion drivers and enhanced privacy controls.\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [IAB Names David

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Innovation](/innovation)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nSuzanne Taylor\n\nSuzanne Taylor, Ph.D., is CTO of Emerging Technology at\n[Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/).\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nThings move quickly in business today. And organizations are increasingly\nusing data to move their businesses forward. IT systems are generating a\ngrowing variety, velocity and volume of data. This both creates challenges and\nopens up new opportunities.\n\nTaking advantage of data to reach business goals requires the ability to scale\nIT operations quickly. AI-led operations (AIOps) helps businesses scale by\nusing artificial intelligence to provide automated, data-driven insights and\nvisibility into operations.\n\n[Gartner says](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3971186), \"The use of\nAIOps platforms to augment IT functions such as event correlation and\nanalysis, anomaly detection, root cause analysis and natural language\nprocessing is growing rapidly.\" It estimates the size of this market at\nbetween $300 million and $500 million annually.\n\nFor AIOps efforts to meet their potential, businesses need to define the value\nthey\u2019re seeking. They must put in place the infrastructure, people and\nprocesses to ensure AIOps success. And they should implement AIOps in a phased\nand programmatic approach.\n\nWhile there are many ways to implement AIOps, including out-of-the-box\nsolutions, an organization\u2019s implementation must match its business needs. A\nbad implementation is often worse than no implementation at all.\n\n**Shifting To A Proactive Stance**\n\nAIOps can serve to reduce the time it takes to solve IT issues. It also lowers\nthe noise that IT operational staff faces in addressing tickets and incidents.\n\nMore importantly, AIOps shifts IT operations\u2019 posture from reactive to\nproactive.\n\nAI can provide insights into the data much more quickly than humans can and\nbecomes an even more powerful tool when the insights are connected to\nautomation. With these tools, organizations can free up IT resources from\nsimply keeping the lights on to a position of innovation.\n\n**Leading With Clear Objectives**\n\nMap your AI effort to specific business objectives and outcomes and clearly\ndefined key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nYou may want to reach a certain mean time to resolution. Perhaps you want to\nreduce your ticket expenses by 20% or lower costs by rightsizing capacity. Or\nmaybe you want to free up level-one engineers to do higher-order work.\n\n**Feeding AIOps With Data**\n\nTo put AI-led operations into practice, you need to have operational data \u2014\nthe more, the better. Data comes from many sources: service/incident tickets,\nhelp desk tickets, application, server logs as well as metrics and cloud\nprovider logs \u2014 all rich sources of information rife for learning.\n\nIt also makes sense to bring data from upfront investments like service\ncontracts into the mix. That might include the fact that your organization has\nprocured a contract to buy 20,000 virtual machines. Now you can see that\nsomebody spent a lot of money on the data center. You can then use that\nfinancial data as a benchmark against which to model savings. Understanding\nbusiness goals has to be taken into account at every step of the process.\n\n**Gathering The Necessary Talent**\n\nCloud providers are investing billions to make it easier to launch AI and\nmachine learning initiatives. Now, you don\u2019t need as many people, thanks to\nall the cognitive services and automations of these cloud providers. Just make\nsure to leverage cloud and cloud-native infrastructure capabilities.\n\nHowever, you will need both technical talent and subject matter experts. Data\nscientists develop and test the machine learning models. But data scientists\nare hard to get. If an organization is looking to fill a data scientist\nposition, it might consider launching an AIOps challenge through Google\u2019s\n[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) community. If you want to launch a Kaggle-\ntype effort, announce your challenge, and let the talent identify themselves\nas experts through their work product.\n\nOr you can go to a very specialized partner, like a large multisourcing\nservice integration firm. Make sure your partner has a machine learning\npractice. If they don\u2019t, chances are that they won\u2019t be able to help you. You\nneed practitioners that have experience in this area.\n\nYou will also need data operations. The data operations team knows how to\nmanage the life cycle of the data, including processing and preparing the data\nfor widespread use, and is responsible for the supporting tools and the data\ngovernance in production.\n\nData scientists have strong mathematical, statistical backgrounds, but they\nwill not know much about IT infrastructure. Typically, your own IT operations\nperson or team can help with that. Your IT operations team can also provide\nsubject matter expertise and insights into where intelligence and automation\ncan make the most impact. Finally, you need somebody on the team who can\nautomate processes and connect them to your ticket and incident systems.\n\n**Letting IT Fly**\n\nNow it\u2019s time to get started. Put a pilot in place. Identify some use cases.\nDevelop the models. Run some metrics.\n\nProve out the business value and KPIs. Test model accuracy, and make\nadjustments based on the pilot learnings before going to wide-scale production\n\nThe insights you gain during the AIOps pilot and production stages could\nrelate to infrastructure capacity. Or they could provide you with a greater\nability to understand the security posture of infrastructure.\n\nFor example, you can forecast how and when capacity is likely to run out. Or\nyou can predict where the infrastructure is going to have underutilized\ncapacity. That way, you can shift or rightsize to get more bang for your buck.\n\nAIOps also means you can now go and spot anomalies in your infrastructure. You\ncan even detect potential security issue evidence points. Then you can contain\nyour security blast radius.\n\n**Using Predictions To Take Action**\n\nIt\u2019s very important that all these predictive insights lead to an attended or\nunattended action.\n\nThat means making a recommendation to an engineer or automatically launching a\nbot to resolve. That way, before something becomes an issue, you can detect\nit. You can then map it to a certain process and enforce a policy by taking\naction.\n\n**AI Is Here**\n\nThe current approach to IT operations is not scalable or sustainable. It\u2019s\nbetter for your reputation and more affordable for you to resolve issues\nbefore they result in outages.\n\nThe time for AIOps is now.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Suzanne Taylor, Ph.D.](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2020/02/suzannetaylor1_avatar_1580851793.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/suzannetaylor1/\n\"Photo of Suzanne Taylor, Ph.D.\")\n\n[Suzanne Taylor,\nPh.D.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/suzannetaylor1/)\n\nSuzanne Taylor, Ph.D., is CTO of Emerging Technology at\n[Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/).

**Provided at no cost to researchers, the COVID-19 Playbook, built on top of\nthe Signals Analytics platform, helps surface critical market intelligence and\ntrends with off-the-shelf taxonomies and visualization tools**\n\nNEW YORK, March 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- [Signals\nAnalytics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2760166-1&h=1622174351&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.signals-\nanalytics.com%2F&a=Signals+Analytics), the next-generation advanced analytics\nplatform that leverages external data to uncover trends and predictive\ninsights, today unveils its COVID-19 Playbook, providing access to critical\nmarket intelligence and trends surrounding potential treatments for the novel\ncoronavirus. As part of their dedication to fighting the virus, Signals\nAnalytics is offering the COVID-19 Playbook at no cost to researchers looking\nto monitor vaccines that are in development for COVID-19 and other strains of\ncoronavirus; monitor trending drugs that are being tested for COVID-19; and\nassess which drugs are being repurposed to help treat infected people.\n\n[![\\(PRNewsfoto/Signals\nAnalytics\\)](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![\\(PRNewsfoto/Signals\nAnalytics\\)](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I.Y_EAztLumTTCpobPPo.A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/3deec94536f6e578da4b40fae40c9fc7)(PRNewsfoto/Signals\nAnalytics)More](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1043164/signals_analytics_logo_1200x400px_ID_c964ee8eb363_Logo.html)\n\nThe COVID-19 Playbook is a front-end user interface of the Signals Analytics\nplatform, powered by advanced analytics, patented Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) techniques and taxonomies developed by domain experts with years of\nacademic and pharmaceutical industry experience. It connects data from a wide\nrange of sources including clinical trials, research papers, business events,\nannouncements, media coverage, drug developments and more. Context is\nextracted from the various data types and visualizations and actionable\ninsights are generated.\n\nLike Signals Analytics' other playbooks, the COVID-19 Playbook is aimed at\nheads of research, development, and innovation as well as leaders responsible\nfor growth, business development, mergers and acquisitions, looking for ways\nto speed up the vaccine and drug discovery process. The aggregated dashboards\naddress many important business questions such as: what are the leading and\nemerging targets being analyzed for COVID-19, which are the leading and\nemerging drugs and vaccines that are being researched and tested, which drugs\nare being repurposed to treat COVID-19, and which entities are leading and\nemerging for COVID-19 testing and treatment.\n\n\"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, a deluge of data is being generated\nevery day and it is impossible for researchers to keep up,\" said Gil Sadeh,\nCEO of Signals Analytics. \"Most other platforms provide insights based on\nlimited data sets or simple reference listings that require the user to input\nspecific search parameters. The Signals Analytics platform on the other hand\nis designed to surface trends and actionable insights across a wide range of\ndata sets to alleviate the burden researchers and analysts face as they look\nfor clues that will speed up vaccine development and identify effective\ntreatments. In the middle of this pandemic, every minute counts. We are proud\nto offer our COVID-19 Playbook to industry leaders, non-profits and government\nagencies to turn a very labor-intensive process filled with risk and\nuncertainty into something actionable and relevant that will speed up the end\nto this scourge.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 Playbook includes dashboards such Drug Pipeline Overview, a\nCOVID-19 Target and Modality Landscape, and Research Paper Assessment. In\naddition, users can set manual alerts through the Findings section to receive\nupdates once per week.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the early findings from the new COVID-19 Playbook includes a\nsignificant increase in research around a target molecule called CYP34A,\ncoming from academia, pharmaceutical companies and other research\ninstitutions, suggesting this is an area for pursuit for vaccines and\ntreatment drugs. Linking to the actual publications provides the detail for an\norganization to determine whether they should devote resources in this area.\n\nOn March 30, Signals Analytics will be sponsoring FiercePharma's webinar\ncalled, \"The Race to Develop a Vaccine\" where the company will feature some\nearly findings from its own analysis on the COVID-19 Playbook.

multi-industry digital transformation\n\nBy **William Smith** **.** Mar 09, 2020, 12:30PM\n\n![Enterprise AI software provider C3.ai is a specialist in assisting companies\nwith digital\ntransformation.\u00a0](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/sites/default/files/styles/slider_detail/public/topic/image/2020-03-02%20%281%29_0.jpg?itok=yAnipWNI)\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsYxFzq94w)\n\n**Enterprise AI software provider[C3.ai](https://c3.ai/) is a specialist in\nassisting companies with digital transformation. **\n\nIts C3 AI Suite allows for the construction of AI applications specifically\nbuilt for enterprise. In-built AI applications include the likes of predictive\nmaintenance, fraud detection, sensor network health, supply network\noptimisation, energy management, anti-money laundering and customer\nengagement, all of which are applicable across multiple industries.\n\nSuch industries include manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, banking,\naerospace and defence, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities\nand transportation.\n\n[Manufacturing](https://c3.ai/industries/manufacturing/)\n\nC3.ai brings its expertise to bear on the manufacturing industry via data\nintegration from enterprise systems, sensor networks and other external\nsources.

Such applications can be applied to use cases such as the\noptimisation of supply networks, yields, prices and warranties.\n\n[Supply Chain](https://c3.ai/industries/transportation/)\n\nSupply chains are notoriously complex beasts. Wrangling them is made easier\nwith the application of AI, with the company\u2019s solution having a\ntransportation focus to improve fleet management.

**\n\nAI and machine learning are dependent on high-value data, which means IT\ndepartments need to have the proper visibility into what is happening on their\nnetworks.\n\n**\n\nAchieving IT automation continues to be a major goal for many enterprises. As\nCIOs contend with shrinking staffs and increasingly complex IT needs, being\nable to redeploy resources away from the help desk and troubleshooting needs\nand onto more strategic challenges is a must. But reaching that goal requires\norganizations to embrace AI to solve the massive data and decision-making\nchallenges needed to automate a large enterprise at scale.\n\n**See also:** [Energy Sector Realizes Untapped Potential for Real-Time\nAnalytics](https://www.rtinsights.com/energy-sector-realizes-untapped-\npotential-real-time-analytics/)\n\nMachine learning and AI are crucial tools in providing secure and predictive\nanalytics in the data center and beyond. The focus there is on the predictive\n\u2013 by being able to understand and benchmark data center and network operations\nover time, AI will be able to thwart problems before they arise, streamlining\noperations and reducing unplanned downtime in the network.\n\nBy marrying AI with real-time analytics, enterprises are equipped with\nunprecedented visibility into the user experience. This information allows IT\nworkers to be proactive in a way that they\u2019ve never been before. It is\ntransforming the support experience, moving away from the incumbent legacy\nworld of reacting, and leaning towards proactively alerting through the power\nof data, data science, and AI so that they can resolve most problems well\nbefore end users even know there is an issue to report.\n\nAI provides a number of benefits, all of which increase accuracy and\nefficiency while reducing individual time investment and costs. They include:\n\n  * **AI can improve accuracy and save employees time:** By reducing the time needed for tasks such as collecting data and double-checking work, AI can save employees time and increase overall accuracy to empower enterprises to make faster and smarter business decisions\n  *  **AI can help enterprises save money:** AI is a long-term investment: implementing AI may be cost-heavy at the beginning, but over time, the increased efficiency will result in a more profitable process overall that is well worth the initial investment\n  *  **AI allows enterprises to predict problems before they occur:** AI gives IT workers the power to be proactive: in addition to less worry about human errors, workflows can be self-corrected and/or optimized in real-time, allowing for peace of mind so that employees can focus on more important tasks\n\nThere are a number of ways that businesses can adopt AI technologies and\nimplement them into real-time analytics. Some include improving established\nprocesses, such as data management. Others include introducing technology that\nis new for the enterprise, such as the proliferation of virtual assistants.\n\n**Virtual assistants**\n\n  * Businesses can take analytics to the next level with tools such as the ability to have an AI virtual assistant that can proactively tell you how you should spend your time, measure your activities, learn from them and solve problems proactively in the future\n  * Virtual assistants can also help users troubleshoot and extract insights from the network while applying data science and AI to analyze and correlate data\n\n**Data management**\n\n  * AI can make the data management process more robust; AI can utilize machine learning-based optimization to help businesses predict and shape outcomes via smart, data-based decisions\n  * Creating a robust data set that characterizes network, client and application behavior can create a strong foundation for AI processes to build upon \n\nDespite all of the benefits that AI can bring, companies do need to understand\nthe challenges. AI and machine learning are dependent on high-value data,\nwhich means IT departments need to have the proper visibility into what is\nhappening on their networks. Perhaps an even greater challenge is preparing\nemployees for the realities of AI. Often feared as the job-killer, smart IT\nleaders need to get ahead of that issue by offering programs on how to work\nwith AI technologies and ensuring their teams understand that AI is not a\nreplacement for individuals, but instead another tool that will make their job\nsimpler and more productive.\n\nTagged\n\n  * [data management](https://www.rtinsights.com/tag/data-management/)\n  *

Read this post by Shane to\ndiscover four predictive AI tools that can help you grow your business by\nproviding valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.**_\n\nWe are all aware of the technological advances in the field of AI and how they\nare disrupting the business landscape. From AI chatbots providing human-like\ninteractions to AI-based tools that help you optimize your marketing, there\nare numerous applications of AI for your business.\n\nBut, what if we tell you that you can now not only get insights from past data\nbut also predict future trends and customer behavior? You\u2019d be surprised and\namazed at the same time, right?\n\nWell, predictive AI is no longer just a theory. It has become a reality.\n\nThere are tools that are able to successfully use predictive algorithms to\nhelp your business grow. Here are four of the best such tools for you.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Getting Customer Experience Right with a Hybrid\nApproach**](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/customer-\nexperience-2/getting-customer-experience-right-with-a-hybrid-approach/\n\"Getting Customer Experience Right with a Hybrid Approach\")\n\n## 1\\. Xineoh\n\n## **![](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\nThis is the most disruptive tool of all the [AI-based\nsolutions](https://shanebarker.com/blog/best-ai-chatbot/) out there. And, it\nis the one that has come the closest to actually predicting [consumer\nbehavior](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/data-management/consumer-\nbehavior-matters-more-than-sales-trends/) using artificial intelligence.\n\nIn fact, they are so confident in their product that the company\u2019s CEO claims\nthat it will surprise you with insights from your own data within two weeks.\nAnd, this is much cheaper than using a team of data scientists to do this for\nyou.\n\n### So what exactly is Xineoh?  \n\nWell, it is a mathematical modeling and machine learning platform that\npredicts customer behavior and recommends products and solutions to them. The\ncompany has used this technology to develop several products and solutions for\nits customers.\n\nHere are some of the solutions that they have developed:\n\n### Media Recommender  \n\nThis uses predictive AI to recommend the right media and content to users.\nThis solution is especially good for media or video streaming companies to\nrecommend movies and other content to their customers.\n\n### Product Recommender  \n\nThis is a powerful recommendation engine that suggests the most relevant\nproducts to your customers based on their likes and preferences. It predicts,\nwith good accuracy, what a particular customer might be interested in.\n\n### Pricer\n\nThis AI-based solution helps you keep smart prices for your products and\nservices. You can also use it to determine what offers to run and how much\ndiscount to give. You can also implement dynamic pricing for your store and\nuse scientific pricing methods to get maximum conversions.\n\n### Demand Predictor  \n\nXineoh\u2019s demand predictor can accurately predict consumer demand trends for\nyour products or services. This helps you optimize your inventory management\nand reduce wastage, while also ensuring that consumer demands are met.\n\n### Inventory Optimizer  \n\nThis is an inventory optimization tool that provides accurate predictions\nsuited to your specific business needs. Using this, you can significantly\nreduce costs and improve efficiency. This is especially useful for product-\nbased businesses and [ecommerce\nplatforms](https://www.adamenfroy.com/ecommerce-platforms).\n\n### Segmenter\n\n\u200b\u200bThis is a customer targeting and segmenting solution that categorizes\ncustomers based on their online behavior instead of demographics. It analyzes\neach customer\u2019s past interactions with your business and segments them based\non that behavior. This is a much more efficient and effective way of targeting\ncustomers.\n\n### Anti-Churn  \n\nThis is another area where predictive AI helps businesses. You can use this\ntool to successfully predict if and when a customer is going to leave. This\ndata helps you prepare for it and target them with incentives and offers to\nstay. Ultimately, this reduces your customer churn and improves customer\nretention.\n\n## 2\\. Black Swan Data\n\n**![](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\nThis is another great tool that predicts consumer trends based on insights\ngathered using AI. Their expertise lies in analyzing social data and\nextracting valuable insights from it.\n\nThe platform tracks millions of social media conversations and uses Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) to make sense of it. They then categorize this data\nand try to identify emerging topics and trends.\n\nThe next step is weighing each trend and determining its importance. They do\nthat by assessing each trend on different factors like sentiment, growth rate,\nvolume, etc. over a period of time. This then provides insights on the future\ngrowth potential of each trend and they even provide a score for each.\n\nBrands can access this data and directly find out the latest consumer trends,\ntheir likes and preferences, and how it is all changing over time. This can\nhelp them design products and offer solutions that solve customer problems and\nimprove customer experience.\n\nThey provide two solutions or products through which brands can access these\ninsights, these are:\n\n### Trendscope\n\nThis is the platform that provides you insights into consumer trends that can\nfuel your future business innovations. Apart from the trends, you also\nunderstand the consumer factors that are driving the trend. These insights are\nvery useful for any company trying to develop new products and solutions for\nits customers.\n\n## Horizon\n\nThis solution provides an in-depth report about industry trends and what\u2019s\nhappening in your niche.

There is a lot of uncertainty as the world\ndecides how to cope with the disruption of life as we know it. There is no\nshortage of problems to solve from keeping our global economy afloat, to\ninnovating new medical remedies, to managing healthcare staff and hospital\ncapacity, to disseminating reliable information, to supporting emergency\nresponders. At the core of all these challenges is human interaction, human\nperception and human ingenuity.\n\nAs we practice social distancing and new restrictions are placed on travel,\nsocial venues, workplaces and schools, we are forced to rethink how we\ninteract with each other. Luckily, we live in a time where technology enables\nus to remain connected even when physically disconnected. We have instant\naccess to new government orders and advisement from health organizations, we\ncan maintain face-to-face contact via video calls, we can leverage\nneighborhood apps to identify who in our community needs help, and the list\ngoes on. The same can be said for organizations as technology is a key enabler\nfor creating connectivity across the workforce, maintaining business\ncontinuity, evolving physical meetings and events to virtual spaces, and\noffering channels for instant communication.\n\nBut, when making decisions for employees, for customers and partners, for\nlocal and global economies, the stakes are higher and there is heightened\nresponsibility to address distance bias, manage transparent and timely\ncommunications, and maintain morale. In a time of social and financial\ndistress, we can\u2019t afford to be slow, wrong or ill-informed\u2014enter analytics.\n\n**Analytics as a Stabilizer**\n\nToday In: [AI](https://www.forbes.com/ai)\n\n  * [\n\n### Gaming Notebooks Get A Boost From AMD, Intel And Nvidia\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2020/04/07/gaming-notebooks-get-\na-boost-from-amd-intel-and-nvidia/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Smart Home Versus Connected Home: The Later Is Happening Today And\nArtificial Intelligence Can Help Manage The Complexity\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidteich/2020/04/07/smart-home-versus-\nconnected-home-the-later-is-happening-today-and-artificial-intelligence-can-\nhelp-manage-the-complexity/)\n\n  * [\n\n### AutoML 2.0: Is The Data Scientist Obsolete?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/04/07/automl-20-is-the-\ndata-scientist-obsolete/)\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) opened the floodgates to a surplus of information (or\nmisinformation), noise and unsupported claims that our society is challenged\nto decipher as we aim to make the best decisions for our families, communities\nand global society. This is analogous for the dizzying amount of data\norganizations are faced with when trying to make the best decisions for growth\nand performance. In the context of a global pandemic, the rules of the game\nchange and businesses are suddenly asked to produce the same output with\nbroken operations, limited resources and less clarity on what our world will\nlook like in the next week, let alone the next month, quarter or year. In\nturbulent times, good information, good data and the capacity to derive good\ndecisions with analytics are more critical than ever.\n\nAnalytics can serve as a stabilizer. Whether you\u2019re a data worker in\nhealthcare tasked with optimizing hospital capacity, in transportation tasked\nwith reevaluating flight schedules or in manufacturing tasked with determining\nsupplier capacity, analytics can serve as both a trusted advisor and your most\npowerful defense when making a decision that has significant consequences.\nData analytics, like many scientific practices, is often associated with fact,\nlogic and precision, rather than emotion; and yet, it informs human decisions\nthat impact personal outcomes\u2014which patient gets admitted, whose flight home\ngets cancelled or who gets laid off when their company can\u2019t meet production\nschedules.\n\n**React with Resilience**\n\nIn any crisis, we often look to address the now without much thought about\nwhat comes next. Crisis or not, businesses always need to think about putting\nthe right people, processes and technologies in place to [future-\nproof](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deanstoecker/2020/02/25/the-fourth-\nrevolution-the-age-of-digital-enlightenment/#77d901f760e5\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/deanstoecker/2020/02/25/the-fourth-revolution-\nthe-age-of-digital-enlightenment/#77d901f760e5\") their organizations. People\nare essential in assigning situational context and logic to data when\nnavigating uncharted territory; process is critical to optimizing workforce\nefficiency; nimble technology is required to respond rapidly to the unknown\nand to mitigate potential risks.\n\nAt the first sign of recovery, organizations will shift focus and face a new\nset of challenges they should\u2019ve prepared for\u2014perhaps most critically, supply\nchain. Disruption to supply chain has worldwide implications and one factory\nclosure can create a long-term domino effect, impacting a company\u2019s ability to\ndeliver. In parallel to reacting to short-term business implications, leaders\nneed to implement a robust analytic strategy and leverage predictive insights\nto identify and prepare for future vulnerabilities.\n\n![Global supply chain distribution](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1153448444/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=6000&cropY1=0&cropY2=3376)\n\nGlobal supply chain distribution\n\nGetty\n\n**Be Part of the Solution**\n\nMachines are the enabler, but [humans solve\nproblems](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deanstoecker/2019/09/05/the-\nintelligence-enigma-balancing-the-power-between-humans-and-\nmachines/#2934d65a1415\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/deanstoecker/2019/09/05/the-intelligence-enigma-\nbalancing-the-power-between-humans-and-machines/#2934d65a1415\").\n\nThe power of analytics extends far beyond one organization\u2019s ability to\nweather the storm but can serve as a critical driver in reaching a global\nsolution. As Buckminster Fuller once stated, \u201cHumanity is acquiring all the\nright technology for all the wrong reasons.\u201d We are all responsible for\nprotecting our global economy and our societal functions. In a time where\nconnection is limited, sharing is more important than ever. Share resources,\nshare knowledge, share solutions.

Their\nmission is to make data science effortless by enabling anyone to run complex\ndata predictions and analytics, simply by asking questions in natural language\nwith no code, no special training and all in less than minute.\n\nThe tech startup has closed its funding round with Arka Venture Labs leading\nit.\n\n### **How Obviously.AI Works**\n\nObviously AI uses state-of-the-art natural language processing to break apart\na question, interpret it and find the right data. Then to make predictions, it\nruns hundreds of machine learning algorithms in parallel and finds the right\nalgorithm for your dataset. Finally, it identifies top attributes that impact\nthe outcome you are trying to predict and delivers highly-accurate reports in\nunder a minute.\n\nHere are the sorts of straight-forward, yet vitally important predictive and\nanalytical questions Obviously AI can address:\n\n  * \"Which users are most likely to buy again?\"\n  * \"Age and location of user paying more than $500?\"\n  * \"Which customers are likely to cancel their subscription?\"\n  * \"Will Tim Smith upgrade his plan?\"\n\nThe platform is ideal for a range of small and medium businesses or small\ndepartments of larger companies.\n\nFor example, in retail the software can optimize assortments, predict\ninventory burn or forecast staffing. For healthcare companies it can assist\nadministrators to predict and prevent hospital readmissions, predict which\npatients are less likely to adhere to prescribed drug regimen and create the\nright intervention plan to increase medication adherence as well as help\npredict appointment no-shows.\n\nOther appropriate use cases include insurance, marketing, banking, gaming and\nSaaS. The platform is available in free, Pro and Pro Plus versions.\n\nWe realized that business users often cared about getting decision making\ninsights about their customers, products and its usage. But often had to wait\nfor weeks on a data engineer to get a single question answered.\u201d said Nirman\nDave, Co-founder and CEO, Obviously AI. \u201cWe have been on a mission to make\ndata science effortless just by asking questions. It\u2019s amazing what marketers,\nsalespeople and other non-technical business users can learn when they use our\nplatform.\u201d quoted Tapojit Debnath, Co founder and CTO.\n\n**About Arka Ventures**\n\nRELATED READING  Data Science Startup Gyana raises $3.9 Mn Funding from\nTwitter Co-founder Biz Stone,\nothers](https://www.indianweb2.com/2020/03/05/data-science-startup-gyana-\nraises-3-9-mn-funding-from-twitter-co-founder-biz-stone-others/)\n\nArka Venture Labs is the first of its kind India-US cross-border accelerator\nfund that has been launched with three VC firms coming in as Anchor LPs.

Invest In Ed is throwing a rally for the kickoff of collecting\nsignatures for its ballot initiative. (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic)\n\nHere is the latest sign that Republicans could have a tough time hanging onto\ntheir ironclad control of the Arizona Legislature this year.\n\nThe No. 1 issue in the state is \u2026\n\nNot immigration.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s education, according to [a new poll from OH Predictive\nInsights](https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-the-state-\nmar2020/).\n\nCue the shivers from Republicans who have long run the Legislature \u2013 the ones\nwho now maintain control of the state House by a thinnest of margins.\n\nThe ones who just might lose the House this year for the first time since\n1966.\n\n## Immigration is down, education is up\n\n\u201cEducation now is the top issue, which hasn\u2019t happened since October of 2018\nwhen we were polling,\u201d Mike Noble of OH Predictive Insights told me. \u201cI think\neducation is going to be playing a pretty dominant role in the elections in\nArizona compared to immigration.\u201d\n\nImmigration rocketed to the top of Arizonans\u2019 minds in the weeks leading up to\nthe November 2018 election as the first migrant caravan was working its way to\nthe U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n**Looking for the other side of the story?[Subscribe today for access to even\nmore opinions](https://cm.azcentral.com/specialoffer?gps-\nsource=CPNEWS&utm_medium=onsite&utm_source=TAGLINE&utm_campaign=NEWSROOM&utm_content=OPINION).\n**\n\nBy May 2019, 38% of Arizonans listed immigration as their top priority,\ncompared with 25% most concerned about education. Since then, however, the\nimmigration numbers have been dropping in OH Predictive Insights' quarterly\npolling while education has been rising.\n\nBy December, immigration still led education as the top issue in Arizona, 31%\nto 26%.\n\nThose numbers flipped in March, with 30% now listing education as the top\nconcern and 26% immigration. I\n\nEducation was the top issue among both Democrats and independents while\nRepublicans continue to see immigration as the most important issue facing the\nstate. (The poll of 600 likely voters was conducted March 3-4 and has a margin\nof error of 4%.)\n\n![A new poll shows education is on top of voters' minds, surpassing\nimmigration for the first time since late 2018.](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/presto/2020/03/09/PPHX/6b3603f6-6473-4be3-a726-c00771357129-aztopissuesaZPOP32020-9900000000079e3c.png?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp)\n\nA new poll shows education is on top of voters' minds, surpassing immigration\nfor the first time since late 2018. (Photo: OH Predictive Insights)\n\n## Democrats can win with a few seats\n\nGiven that immigration is the Republicans\u2019 wheelhouse while education \u2026 isn\u2019t\n\u2026, I\u2019m guessing alarms are sounding in state GOP headquarters.\n\nIf you are Rep. Jay Lawrence, R-Scottsdale, you\u2019re probably breathing into a\npaper bag about now. Ditto for GOP legislators in Glendale, Chandler and other\nplaces where Democrats are hoping to pick up seats (read: Flagstaff).\n\n\"They (Democrats) could take the House with the makeup of one seat or two\nseats that they could pick up,\" Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin, of\nHighGround Public Affairs, told me. \"And they'll come close in the Senate.\"\n\nDemocrats gained four House seats in 2018 \u2013 the year Red for Ed teachers took\nto the streets to protest a decade's worth of neglect to public schools \u2013\nleaving Republicans with a tenuous 31-29 hold on the chamber.

It can be five to 25 times [more expensive to acquire a new\ncustomer](https://www.huify.com/blog/acquisition-vs-retention-customer-\nlifetime-value) than to retain an existing one.\n\nMore importantly, [improving your customer\nretention](http://www2.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf) by\njust 5 percent can increase profits by 25-95 percent, depending on your\nindustry and company size. Needless to say, companies cannot afford to neglect\ntheir customer churn.\n\nToday, many companies are intrigued by the idea of turning to artificial\nintelligence for help in the sales process. However, most do not know where or\nhow to get started. The best way to tap into the power of AI and machine\nlearning is by building an intelligent experience.\n\nThe intelligent experience is all about leveraging AI and ML to derive\npredictive insights that can be embedded into the workflow of a CRM. Companies\nseeking a competitive advantage must find ways to make their business\noperations more intelligent.\n\n##  Shifting the Focus\n\nHow can the intelligent experience help improve customer retention? It starts\nwith a shift in focus. Typically, businesses are addressing the problem by\nhoming in on churn. They invest time in figuring out how to prevent churn.\nHowever, the focus needs to shift from customer churn alone to an overall look\nat customer success.\n\nFocusing on churn exclusively is a very reactive tactic. Oftentimes, companies\nare late to the party with churn. They will identify customers likely to churn\nwhen it's too late. This is because there is a major difference between a\nleading indicator and a lagging indicator.\n\nFor example, many businesses want to look at order cadence as a sign of churn.\nHowever, it tends to be a lagging indicator of a problem that manifested\nearlier. In order to make an impact, businesses must look at the leading\nindicators.\n\nOften the best indicators for churn are further back in the customer\nlifecycle, during acquisition and onboarding. Sometimes high customer\nattrition is not due to poor customer service but to poor customer acquisition\nefforts.\n\nThink back to what was happening in your business when a new customer started.\nWere you launching a new product? Were there changes in your manufacturing\nprocess? How long did it take the customer to start utilizing your service\nonce the deal was executed?\n\nIt is crucial to assess the landscape of the acquisition time period. This\noften is where perceptions of the relationship start to form. Customers are\ngoing to be comparing their initial experience to the expectations you set\nduring the sales process. As the age-old adage tells us, first impressions are\nhard to shake.\n\n##  Examining the Cost\n\nHave you ever determined the true cost of customer churn for your business?\nBefore you take any steps to improve customer retention, you must quantify the\ncost of churn. There are three major variables to consider.\n\nFirst is obviously the loss of recurring revenue. Whatever that customer is\npaying is money lost.\n\nSecond, with any existing customer, there is an opportunity to upsell and\nexpand revenue. So you have to take into consideration the loss of that\npotential revenue.\n\nFinally, factor in all your customer acquisition costs.\n\nBy combining these factors, you can get a better understanding of the true\ncost of customer churn.\n\nOnce you have determined the true cost of customer churn, you can begin\nassessing the quality of churn. Not all customer attrition is regrettable. You\nshould be able to determine what an acceptable level of churn is and set an\nestablished benchmark using basic analytics.\n\nFor example, it might be OK for a customer to leave if the cost-to-serve is\nhigh and the margins are low. That assumes you are acquiring net-new customers\nat an appropriate velocity and volume to compensate for lost business. AI is\ncertainly exciting, but you cannot jump into it without first laying the\nfoundation with basic analytics.\n\n##  Getting Smarter About Customer Success\n\nAfter you shift your focus from purely churn to overall customer success,\ndetermine the true cost of customer churn, and establish foundational\nanalytics, you then can begin using analytics and AI to drive customer success\nand reduce attrition.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the real value is in creating an intelligent\nexperience. When implementing AI into a business, gathering insights is great,\nbut that is not enough. You must be able to leverage the insights that can be\nuncovered from data to identify next steps.\n\nYour AI project cannot be simply about getting a score of how likely a\ncustomer is to churn. You need to set your team up for action by weaving\ninsights into the business process. This allows the focus to move from churn\nto customer success.\n\nHere is how it actually works. To predict the probability of a customer to\nchurn, you need a logistic regression model that is trained on historical\ndata. It is looking for examples of customers who have churned and ones who\nhave not. It will learn from these situations and develop a probability score\nfor each customer. Then various actions can be taken to influence that\nprobability in hopes of changing the outcome.\n\nNatural language processing models can be used to discern a customer's\nsentiment. These models can be fed large amounts of unstructured data -- such\nas call recordings and Web chats -- to find themes. Then customers can be\nclassified by how they feel: good, bad or indifferent. These classifications\nthen are put into a logistic regression-based churn model.\n\nYou are starting to chain together multiple models to help isolate customers\nwho are likely to churn. The key is to figure out how to intervene before\nsomething actually happens. This is the power of predictive analytics. It\nallows you to be more proactive in improving customer retention rather than\nreactive to customer churn.\n\nHere is an example of how to pair insight with action: George, an inside sales\nrep, is working the retention desk, which is a specialized team tasked with\nreaching out to customers who have a high likelihood of churning. He enters\nthe office in the morning and logs into his CRM. He sees a call list generated\nby an AI model that surfaces and ranks customers likely to churn. It tells\nGeorge why the customer is likely to churn and provides a relevant sales play\nto take action.\n\nThere is even more value in what AI and ML can do after George makes the call\nand takes the recommended action. Once he inputs his call notes and updates\nthe CRM, the customer can be re-scored in real time. This system allows you to\ncontinue ensuring you are taking the next best steps to retain the customer.\n\nAI is the future of business operations. When contemplating an investment in\nAI, be sure you have a setup that will allow you to embed insights into the\ndaily workflow of your organization. Through the power of AI, you can start\nblurring the lines between sales, service and marketing.\n\nRemember, the best time to have a selling conversation is right after you've\nsolved a problem. AI can be used to improve customer retention in a variety of\nindustries. Consider how implementing AI can help change your sales operations\nand ultimately drive customer success. ![](//www.ectnews.com/images/end-\nenn.gif)\n\n* * *\n\n![](/images/rws969499/Nicholas Christ.jpg) **Nicholas Christ** is account\ndirector at [Atrium](http://atrium.ai/).

Even in a state Trump won in\n2016, Arizona, he is in serious trouble if Biden is his opponent.\n\nThe OH Predictive Insights Arizona poll shows \u201cBiden leading President Donald\nTrump in a head-to-head matchup by 6 points. However, the same poll shows\nTrump beating Sen. Bernie Sanders by 7 points.\u201d Here is the critical point: \u201c\n**The reason for this performance gap between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden is\nthat less than three-quarters of the respondents who said they would vote for\nBiden in a head to head match up with Donald Trump also said they would vote\nfor Sanders if he were to be the nominee**.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n[Election 2020 live\nupdates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/13/campaign-live-\nupdates/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_4&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_4)\n\nLikewise, the [Univision/Arizona State\nUniversity](https://st1.uvnimg.com/07/2e/d0d9a91c4000996d8bcc95b85319/univisionpolling-\nmarch-arizona.pdf)[\n](https://st1.uvnimg.com/07/2e/d0d9a91c4000996d8bcc95b85319/univisionpolling-\nmarch-arizona.pdf)poll shows Biden\u2019s favorable/unfavorable rating (48 percent\nto 41 percent) far rosier than Trump\u2019s (46 percent to 54 percent). Biden beats\nTrump by eight percentage points in a head-to-head match-up, while Sanders\nleads by five points. By a 63 percent to 16 percent margin, voters are less\nlikely to vote for someone identified as a socialist. (56 percent to 24\npercent if a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d). Against Sanders, Biden leads by a huge\nmargin of 51 percent to 34 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s problem certainly is his stance on immigration. In Arizona 73\npercent of voters favor a path to citizenship for the \u201cdreamers,\u201d while 55\npercent oppose a wall on the southern border. By a 52 percent to 48 percent\nmargin, voters in Arizona think Trump should have been impeached _and_\nremoved. Some 59 percent say Trump\u2019s policies have not benefited them\npersonally at all or only a little bit. Noteworthy: 52 percent say they will\nnot vote for Trump under any circumstances.\n\nThese figures undermine the notion that the only way to beat Trump is through\ncapturing or recapturing white male voters in the Upper Midwest. With numbers\nlike these from Arizona, a road through the Sun Belt or South (e.g., Texas,\nFlorida, Georgia) could very well put Biden over 270 electoral votes.\n\nBiden\u2019s strength in Arizona among Hispanics (61 percent would choose him over\nTrump) and with women (52 percent to 38 percent) also suggests that he might\nmaximize his already strong position with these two groups of voters by\nputting someone from the region on the ticket, perhaps a prominent Latina such\nas New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham or Sen. Catherine Masto Cortez\n(D-Nev.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is a Senate race this year in Arizona as well, which provides more bad\nnews for Republicans. Democrat Mark Kelly leads appointed incumbent Republican\nMartha McSally by a 48 percent to 36 percent\n[margin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/13/arizona-no-wonder-\ntrump-doesnt-want-face-\nbiden/?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13).\n\nFinally, a word about young voters is in order. In the primary, Sanders\ncertainly does better than Biden with these voters. However, in a general\nelection, these voters passionately line up behind a generic (64 percent to 29\npercent) Democrat or behind Biden (62 percent to 28 percent) specifically.\nBiden certainly would want these voters to turn out in strong numbers, but the\neventual nominee will have a big asset in luring all parts of the Democratic\ncoalition: Trump will be on the ballot.\n\n[ ![](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-\nwashpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NQWPUG543FEKTEYOGAJHDM2B4Y.jpg)\n](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/post-opinions-\nsimulator/index.html#/races/)\n\nOpinion\n\n## [Who could win the Democratic\nprimary?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/post-opinions-\nsimulator/index.html#/races/)\n\nUse the Post Opinions Simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in\nupcoming primaries and caucuses.\n\n**Read more:**\n\n[Jennifer Rubin: What\u2019s the moral justification for Bernie Sanders\u2019s fruitless\ncampaign?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/13/whats-moral-\njustification-sanders-fruitless-\ncampaign/?tid=lk_inline_manual_17&itid=lk_inline_manual_17)\n\n[Jennifer Rubin: What to do about a president who says he won\u2019t be tested for\nthe coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/13/what-do-\nabout-president-who-says-he-wont-be-tested-\ncoronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_18&itid=lk_inline_manual_18)\n\n### Joe Biden: More opinions on the 2020 candidate\n\nUpdated March 18, 2020\n\n **Read Post op-eds** by Biden:\n\n  * [Trump won\u2019t destroy me, and he won\u2019t destroy my family](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-biden-trump-wont-destroy-me-and-he-wont-destroy-my-family/2019/10/05/9544b9a4-e7cc-11e9-a6e8-8759c5c7f608_story.html)\n  * [The border won\u2019t be secure until Central America is ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-border-wont-be-secure-until-central-america-is/2018/06/25/5e891566-78a8-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html)\n\n**Explore recent columns** from Post opinion writers and guests:\n\n  * [Jennifer Rubin: It\u2019s over.

Bernie Sanders during a press conference on March 11, 2020, in\nBurlington, Vermont.\n\nSalwan Georges / The Washington Post / Getty Images\n\nOver the course of the Democratic primary, Latinos have been a crucial part of\nSen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s base. His campaign has made a [concerted\neffort](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/california-is-the-first-big-test-\nof-sanderss-voter-turnout-machine/) to [win their\nsupport](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sanders-has-an-edge-among-\nlatino-voters-in-nevada-will-it-hold/), with resounding success thus far:\nAccording to entrance and exit polls, he won 50 percent of Latinos in\n[Nevada](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada), 50 percent in\n[California](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/california) and 39\npercent in [Texas](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/texas). And three\nof the states that vote on Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida, and Illinois -- have\nlarge Latino or Hispanic populations, which could be good news for Sanders.\n\nBut there are signs that he may lose strength with this group in the next\nround of primaries -- [and at least part of the racial\ndivide](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-democratic-primary-\nremain-split-along-racial-lines/) that\u2019s emerged in the contests so far may\nshift. As the newly dominant [national front-\nrunner](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-\nprimary-d/national/), former Vice President Joe Biden may have new openings to\nwin over Latinos in Arizona and Illinois -- in particular, older Latinos.\nAdditionally, Sanders is especially weak among Hispanic voters in Florida,\nwhere his support for socialism and [praise of\naspects](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/24/bernie-sanders-cuban-\nrevolution-117279) of the communist revolution in Cuba may have hurt him.\n\n\u201cSanders is continuing to perform well among Latino voters in states like\nWashington, but it\u2019s not like Latino voters overwhelmingly dislike Biden,\u201d\nsaid [Matt Barreto](http://mattbarreto.com/), a professor of political science\nat the University of California, Los Angeles, and the co-founder of Latino\nDecisions. \u201cThe question is whether Latino voters start seeing Biden as the\ntrue front-runner in this next round of states and start to shift toward him,\nor if they are staying with Sanders.\u201d\n\n## **Sanders still has a good shot among Latinos in Illinois and Arizona**\n\nIt might not be enough to help Sanders win Illinois or Arizona -- according to\nour model, Biden has a 49 in 50 (98 percent) chance of winning\n[Illinois](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-\nforecast/illinois/), and a 29 in 30 (97 percent) chance of winning\n[Arizona](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/arizona/)\n-- but Sanders still seems likely to outperform Biden among Latinos in both\nstates. In Illinois, a new [Emerson\nCollege](https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/illinois-2020-biden-\nleads-sanders-in-the-prairie-state) poll showed Sanders leading Biden 56\npercent to 42 percent among Hispanic or Latino likely voters, despite Biden\u2019s\n20-point lead in the state overall; [Gravis\nMarketing](http://3wyh0y392y42oz41z1bbzx5w-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Illinois-Dems-March-11-2020.pdf) found a similar\nsplit. And two recent polls of Arizona -- one sponsored by\n[Telemundo](https://media.telemundoarizona.com/2019/09/Encuesta-exclusiva-\nTelemundo-primarias-2020-Arizona-.pdf) and the other by [Univision/Arizona\nState\nUniversity](https://st1.uvnimg.com/07/2e/d0d9a91c4000996d8bcc95b85319/univisionpolling-\nmarch-arizona.pdf) -- each gave Sanders a single-digit lead among Hispanic or\nLatino Democrats there. A third Arizona poll, by local firm [OH Predictive\nInsights](https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/2020-arziona-democratic-\nprimary/), did give Biden a big lead among both Hispanic or Latino Democrats\nand Democrats overall, but it was conducted almost entirely before former New\nYork City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the\nrace.\n\nAnother good sign for Sanders: The Latino populations in these two states skew\nyoung compared with a state like Florida, more similar to other heavily Latino\nstates where Sanders has already performed well, such as California and\nNevada. That\u2019s helpful for Sanders because he is [extremely popular among\nyoung voters](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-defines-the-sanders-\ncoalition/), including Latinos -- he won 71 percent of Latinos under the age\nof 30 in California, [according to the exit\npolls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/exit-polls-\ncalifornia-primary.html). And it will likely be difficult to convince many of\nthose younger supporters to switch their allegiance to Biden, according to\nVincent Casillas, a Democratic strategist who lives in Chicago and worked on\nHispanic communications on Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n* * *\n\n## Biden And Sanders Debate Amid Pandemic\n\n* * *\n\nCasillas pointed out that Sanders has the support of several progressive\nLatino politicians from Illinois -- most prominently, [Rep. Chuy\nGarcia](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/2/20/21137639/bernie-\nsanders-jesus-chuy-garcia-endorses-democratic-presidential-nomination) -- who\nare popular among younger voters. And although Casillas is a Biden supporter,\nhe admitted that Sanders has a big edge when it comes to voter outreach among\nLatinos in Illinois. \u201cThe age divide is going to be a big problem for Biden\nhere -- there\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it,\u201d Casillas said. \u201cSanders has done a\ngreat job of organizing and energizing young Latinos here in Illinois. He\u2019s\nway ahead of Biden in terms of outreach to this group.\u201d\n\nBut Biden has at least one advantage in Illinois that plays less of a role in\nother states -- his affiliation with Obama, who lived in Chicago for years and\nis still very popular with the Latino community there, according to Casillas\nand others. \u201cObama is still number-one in Illinois and so I think you may see\nsome Latinos, maybe older Latinos in particular, just naturally migrate toward\nBiden\u2019s campaign because of his affiliation with Obama and the fact that he\u2019s\nwinning other states.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona, meanwhile, an eagerness to support the candidate who can beat\nTrump may nudge some Latinos into Biden\u2019s column. [Eduardo\nSainz](https://www.mifamiliavota.org/people/eduardo-sainz/), the Arizona state\ndirector for Mi Familiar Vota, a Latino civic engagement organization, said\nthat Latino Democrats in Arizona, like Democrats across the country, are eager\nto support a candidate who can win a general election against Trump, because\nso many Latinos are first or second-generation immigrants. \u201cMany people are\nfeeling a lot of fear under this administration, so I\u2019ve seen that defeating\nTrump is a top priority for many Latinos in Arizona,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd voting for Biden is likely no big stretch for Latino Democrats. Even if\nhe\u2019s not quite as beloved as Sanders, most Latino Democrats in Arizona like\nthe former vice president just fine. In a December poll by [Equis\nLabs](https://www.equislabs.us), 50 percent of them had a favorable opinion of\nSanders, while just 14 percent had an unfavorable one; Biden was viewed\nfavorably by 44 percent and unfavorably by 27 percent.\n\nBut Sainz has also observed an age divide among volunteers for his\norganization that leads him to believe that many young Latinos will continue\nto support Sanders. \u201cFrom our older volunteers, I am increasingly hearing that\nthey want to make sure that we beat Trump and based on what they\u2019re hearing\nthey think Biden has a better and better chance, so their vote is going to\nBiden,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the younger demographic are pretty much either undecided\nor voting for Sanders.\u201d\n\nEven if Sanders wins Latinos in Arizona and Illinois, though, his victories\nmight be less decisive than in states like California. \u201cNow that Biden has\ngained front-runner status, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see as many dramatic wins for\nSanders among Latinos,\u201d Barreto said. And perhaps most importantly, Biden is\nstill forecasted to win both states in spite of Sanders\u2019s strength with\nLatinos.\n\n## **But Sanders seems likely to lose Hispanic voters in Florida**\n\nOn the other hand, Hispanic voters are likely to contribute to a massive Biden\nwin in Florida. Biden is leading Sanders there by an [average of more than 40\npercentage points](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-\nprimary-d/florida/) and has a >99 percent chance of winning there according to\nthe [FiveThirtyEight\nforecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-\nforecast/florida/). And according to most recent polls, Biden is leading among\nHispanic or Latino Floridians by large margins (if not quite as large as\nstatewide) \u2014 in stark contrast to other states.\n\n##### Biden leads among Hispanic voters in Florida\n\nTop Democratic candidates\u2019 support among poll respondents who identified as\nHispanic or Latino (depending on the poll) in seven recent Florida polls\n\nPollster | Dates | Biden | Sanders  \n---|---|---|---  \nMason-Dixon/Telemundo | March 4-7 | 48% | 37%  \nFlorida Atlantic University | March 5-7 | 45 | 25  \nSt. Pete Polls/Florida Politics | March 6-8 | 68 | 17  \nUniversity of North Florida | March 5-10 | 65 | 28  \nGravis Marketing | March 10-12 | 49 | 46  \nEmerson College | March 11-12 | 64 | 28  \nPoint Blank Political | March 11-13 | 45 | 41  \n  \nIncludes the most recent poll by each pollster that has surveyed the race\nsince Super Tuesday.\n\nSource: Polls\n\nIt\u2019s a good reminder that Hispanic or Latino voters nationwide aren\u2019t a\nmonolith. Like other voters, their political views often vary along other\ndemographic dimensions, such as age and ethnic origin. For instance, the\nHispanic population in Florida skews older \u2014 35 percent are older than 44,\ncompared with 24 percent in each of Arizona and Illinois \u2014 putting Sanders at\na natural disadvantage.\n\nAnd in Arizona and Illinois \u2014 as well as California, Nevada and Texas \u2014 the\nLatino population is overwhelmingly Mexican American. But Florida is far more\ndiverse. A plurality (29 percent) of the Hispanic population there identifies\nas Cuban American, and there are hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan Americans\nand Nicaraguan Americans as well. Sanders\u2019s brand of democratic socialism is\ndistinct from the policies of former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but he\ndid [support Nicaragua\u2019s communist\ngovernment](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/bernie-sanders-burlington-\nmayor.html) in the 1980s. And according to Barreto, some of the Hispanic\npopulation in Florida may be \u201cvery uncomfortable with the socialism that has\nbeen practiced in their countries in Latin America,\u201d and could be wary of\nsupporting a self-identified democratic socialist like Sanders.\n\nSanders certainly did himself no favors among Cuban Americans when he [told 60\nMinutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-60-minutes-interview-\nhighlights-2020-02-25/) recently that \u201cit\u2019s unfair to simply say everything\n[former Cuban President Fidel Castro did] is bad,\u201d citing Castro\u2019s literacy\nprogram. The remarks led to a [swift\nbacklash](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-\nflorida.html), especially in Florida. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, one of two\nHispanic Democrats who represent Florida in Congress,\n[tweeted](https://twitter.com/DebbieforFL/status/1231922208433459200?s=20), \u201cI\nfind Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 comments on Castro\u2019s Cuba absolutely\nunacceptable.\u201d Two weeks later, she [endorsed\nBiden](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/article241035676.html).\n\nOverall, Sanders now looks [extremely\nunlikely](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/) to win\nthe Democratic nomination for president, and cracks have emerged in his\npreviously solid base of Latino support, but whether Latino voters move\ndecisively into Biden\u2019s column on Tuesday remains to be seen.

By enabling a company to achieve full control of\nthe supply chain system, digital twins confer benefits beyond the end-to-end\nvisibility provided by control towers and the predictive insights generated by\nplanning models like demand forecasting. Supply Chain Digital takes a closer\nlook at [Boston Consulting Group\u2019s](https://www.bcg.com/) article [\u201cConquering\nComplexity in Supply Chains with Digital\nTwins.\u201d](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/operations/conquering-complexity-\nsupply-chains-digital-twins.aspx)\n\n**What is a digital twin?**\n\nIt\u2019s a virtual supply chain replica that consists of hundreds of assets,\nwarehouses, logistics and material flows, and inventory positions. Through\nadvanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), the digital twin emulates\nthe supply chain\u2019s performance, which includes the same level of complexity\nthat drives value loss and risks.\n\n**What are the challenges of managing complexity?**\n\nComplex supply chains are more common in process industries, like chemicals,\nsteel and mining, and in industries with interconnected production and\ndistribution networks. In industries such as this, a single company\u2019s supply\nchain consists of over 1,000 assets, warehouses and logistics flows. This\ncomplexity often leads to compromises and lost value, such as excess inventory\nand lost production time at critical assets. But, what causes these\nchallenges?\n\n  * Residual uncertainty and variability of demand despite advanced demand forecasting.\n\n  * The unpredictability and volatility of supply.\n\n  * Excessively long lead times for receiving materials from global suppliers or for shipping goods to customers, due to the geographic span of the modern supply chain.\n\n  * Interconnected constraints such as warehousing and logistics limitations, stock positions and product portfolio requirements.\n\n**How do digital twins help companies?**\n\nDigital twins can enable companies to apply the insights to augment decision-\nmaking across several multiple planning horizons.\n\n**SEE ALSO:**\n\n  * [Top 10 Consulting Firms: McKinsey & Company](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/supply-chain-management/top-10-consulting-firms-mckinsey-company)\n\n  * [Capgemini: creating sustainable resilience in supply chain](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/supply-chain-management/capgemini-creating-sustainable-resilience-supply-chain)\n\n  * [Healthcare's supply chain in midst of digital transformation](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/technology/healthcares-supply-chain-midst-digital-transformation)\n\n  * [Read the latest issue of Supply Chain Digital here!](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/magazine/supply-chain-digital/march-2020)\n\n**Short-term planning and execution** \\- Digital twins can identify risks\nearly, which allows organisations clarity before a crisis appears. This\nenables companies to reduce the time of bottleneck assets and to improve\ninventory positions.\n\n**Sales and operations planning** \\- By simulating the execution of a specific\nplan, the digital twin can optimise sales and operations planning. This will\nenable the company to reduce and minimise losses that arise from misalignment\nof plans and system constraints.\n\n**Longer-term planning** \\- A company can improve the overall efficiency of\ncapex and optimise the setup of the entire supply chain system through\nunderstanding where the most significant bottlenecks exist.\n\n**For more information on how to conquer complexity in supply

Kluwer arms coronavirus efforts with the launch of a global\nCOVID-19 Search Intensity Monitoring Map using UpToDate that shows how often\nCOVID-19 topics are searched by doctors, nurses and other clinicians globally.\n**\n\n- **Cross-disciplinary teams at Wolters Kluwer developed the interactive map by analyzing how often specific questions related to COVID-19 are searched by doctors, nurses and other clinicians globally. This leverages global search activity in UpToDate, a trusted resource used by more than 1.9 million clinicians for clinical decision support in direct patient care.**\n\n* * *\n\n[Wolters Kluwer, Health](https://wolterskluwer.com/products-services/our-\nportfolio/health.html?utm_source=press-\nrelease&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=interactive-map-pr) is supporting\nclinicians on the front lines fighting the COVID-19 pandemic with additional\nevidence-based resources in\n[UpToDate](http://www.uptodate.com/home?utm_source=press-\nrelease&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=interactive-map-pr)\u00ae and a new\n[interactive COVID-19 search intensity\nmap](http://covid19map.uptodate.com/?utm_source=press-\nrelease&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=interactive-map-pr). The map helps\nclinicians and public health agencies track the virus and may support\nclinicians in gaining predictive insights on reported cases based on clinical\nsearch activity from 1.9 million clinicians at the point of care.\n\n**Interactive COVID-19 Search Intensity Map & Methodology**  \nTo help epidemiologists and public health agencies turn the tide on the\ncoronavirus pandemic, Wolters Kluwer has developed a [global interactive\nbubble map](https://covid19map.uptodate.com/) that highlights areas of high\nclinical search intensity in UpToDate, which may support clinicians in gaining\nhelpful insight to anticipate regional increases of reported\n[COVID-19](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/) cases.\n\nCross-disciplinary teams at Wolters Kluwer developed the interactive map by\nanalyzing how often specific questions related to COVID-19 are searched by\ndoctors, nurses and other clinicians globally. This leverages global search\nactivity in UpToDate, a trusted resource used by more than 1.9 million\nclinicians for clinical decision support in direct patient care.\n\nData scientists calculated and displayed what is called \u201csearch intensity\u201d and\nalso factored into this bubble map cases of COVID-19 reported by [Johns\nHopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). In previous studies\n(looking at MERS and influenza),1,2 an increase in search intensity correlated\nwith documented outbreaks.\n\nThe map illustrates how search intensity increases over time in regions around\nthe world and where it is diminishing. It currently includes country-level\ndata around the world as well as state-level data in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWith a legacy of nearly 30 years, UpToDate has been there to support and\npromote the best patient care around the world; we will never waver in that\ncommitment. In these most difficult times, we want to support clinicians in\nany way we can,\u201d said Denise Basow, MD, CEO, Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters\nKluwer, Health. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have provided open access to our COVID-19\nclinical and patient topics in UpToDate.\u201d\n\nView the live map now:\n[https://covid19map.uptodate.com](https://covid19map.uptodate.com/?utm_source=press-\nrelease&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=interactive-map-pr)\n\nRELATED:   GetWellNetwork, Cerner Deploy Free COVID-19 Solutions to All\nClients](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/03/26/getwellnetwork-cerner-\ncovid-19-solutions/)\n\nTagged With: [Clinical Decision\nSupport](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/clinical-decision-support/),\n[Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/),\n[decision support](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/decision-support/),\n[MD](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/md/), [Patient\nCare](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/patient-care/), [point of\ncare](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/point-of-care/), [Public\nHealth](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/public-health/), [Wolters\nKluwer](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/wolters-kluwer/)\n\n[ultimatesocial networks=\"facebook,twitter,google,linkedin,mail\" url=\"\"\ncustom_class=\"us-posts-bottom\" align=\"left\" count=\"false\"]\n\nGet in-depth healthcare technology analysis and commentary delivered straight\nto your email weekly\n\n[\u00ab GetWellNetwork, Cerner Deploy Free COVID-19 Solutions to All\nClients](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/03/26/getwellnetwork-cerner-\ncovid-19-solutions/)\n\n[COVID-19 Spikes Deaconess Health Adoption of Remote Medical Exams\n\u00bb](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/03/26/covid-19-spikes-deaconess-health-\nadoption-of-remote-medical-exams/)\n\n#### Subscribe to HIT Consultant\n\nLatest insightful articles delivered straight to your inbox weekly.\n\n[Submit a Tip or Pitch](mailto:submissions@hitconsultant.net?subject=Tip or\nPitch Submission)\n\n#### Recent Articles\n\n  * ![COVID-19 Spikes Deaconess Health Adoption of Remote Medical Exams](https://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tytocare-1-290x275.png)![COVID-19 Spikes Deaconess Health Adoption of Remote Medical Exams](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2085%2081%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n### [Tyto Care Lands $50M for Telehealth Platform for On-Demand, Remote\nMedical Examinations](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/04/07/tyto-care-lfunding-\ntelehealth-platform-on-demand-remote-medical-examinations/)\n\n...

From those\nwho post on social media, 10 random names will be drawn and they will receive\na $100 gift certificate to the business that was tagged in their post. You can\npost as many times with as many different businesses that you want.

Working restrictions have\nmeant that not all maintenance tasks can be completed as crews need to be\nseparated and isolated. The consequence is that many non-essential tasks are\nbeing deferred. Hence asset owners and operators are increasingly concerned\nabout the long-term impact that a lack of planned maintenance will have on\nfuture turbine performance.\n\nWith regard to components, many wind industry suppliers are located in those\ncountries hardest hit by C19. Factory shutdowns in places like China and Spain\nhave constrained the supply of parts.\n\nThese two factors are further compounded by the forecast turbine parts, labour\nand supply chain service peak in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 \u2013 which will see demand\novertake supply and may risk bringing critical energy infrastructure offline.\n\nTo avoid this anticipated wind turbine parts, labour and supply chain crunch \u2013\nand to reduce the anticipated supply chain hold-ups \u2013 Onyx InSight is calling\non independent operations and maintenance teams, asset managers and\nengineering departments to openly discuss pressures on purchasing and\nprocurement programmes early in order to better predict and negate future\nmaintenance bottlenecks across the industry.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever we believe it\u2019s critical for asset owners and operators to\ncome together, share experiences and collaborate, in order to maintain\noperational performance for critical energy infrastructure\u201d said Bruce Hall,\nChief Executive Officer, Onyx InSight. \u201cWe all have to step up at this time.\nDuring these unprecedented times, we understand and recognise the importance\nof being able to monitor and track, and then proactively plan and execute,\nwind turbine maintenance campaigns and complex engineering schedules. We also\nrecognise that six-month planned operations and maintenance campaigns have\neffectively been side-lined, as we as an industry work together to combat\nCovid-19.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that asset owners and operators from all around the world come\ntogether to share their experience of how to maintain peak turbine performance\nand tackle the looming global parts, labour and supply chain challenge, Onyx\nInSight has conducted a global survey of O&M leaders across the wind industry\nto evaluate how they are navigating the C19 crisis. These results will be\npresented at its invitation-only virtual roundtable and webinar on 7th and 8th\nApril 2020.\n\nBruce Hall added that following a series of direct discussions with owners and\noperators all around the world, and having collated feedback and thinking from\nmany key industry executives over the course of the past two weeks, the\ncompany will share some of their key insights and observations, to enable\nowner operators to more effectively plan and reset 2020 operations and\nmaintenance strategy. In short, it is not just about how projects are\nperforming now, but how they will continue to perform in the coming weeks and\nmonths.\n\nThe current exceptional situation playing out across the world can only be\ncombated through collaboration and a wider understanding. As the renewable\nenergy industry works hard to solve immediate challenges in the form of a\nsignificant reduction in planned maintenance, the market must also look to\nmitigate future power shortfall risks, as a result of unforeseen turbine\ndowntime.\n\nFor additional information:\n\n[Onyx InSight](https://onyxinsight.com/)\n\n[Add a

Compliance via Software Platforms\n\n## The future of quality lies in data intelligence, and reliable software\nplatforms can help companies be ready.\n\n![data driven\nquality](//www.qualitymag.com/ext/resources/Issues/2020/March/Software/QM0320-FT-\nSoftwareA-p1FT.jpg?1583853282)\n\nMarch 10, 2020\n\n[Bryant Headley](/authors/3229-bryant-headley)\n\nKEYWORDS [compliance](/keywords/7367-compliance) / [data-driven quality\nimprovement](/keywords/3842-data-driven-quality-improvement) /\n[regulations](/keywords/5974-regulations) / [software\ntrends](/keywords/4943-software-trends)\n\n[ Order Reprints ](http://www.bnpmedia.com/reprints)\n\nOne Comment\n\nA fundamental shift is taking place in the way companies are approaching\nregulatory compliance. A lack of structured data is proving to be a\nsubstantial liability--as ill-prepared companies are learning the hard way--\nwhich is leading more organizations to move away from conventional document-\ncentric methodologies and toward a data-centered model of compliance.\n\nThis trend is particularly pronounced in the life sciences where companies\nhave traditionally been mired in mountains of documentation because they tend\nto base their analyses and reporting activities on historical data. But as Big\nData continues to get bigger and harder to manage, more companies are finding\ntheir compliance information trapped in documents that are siloed in disparate\nsystems or inaccessible when needed most.\n\nTo offset the dilemma of disconnected documents, companies are adopting a new\ndata-centered compliance mindset. Realizing that maintaining compliance by\nfocusing primarily on documentation is insufficient, forward-thinking\norganizations are now directing their efforts toward improving access to\nactionable, accurate data and enhancing their ability to analyze that data. As\nthe Deloitte Centre for Health Solutions noted of the new trend, \"Applying\nadvanced data analytics techniques could enable companies to identify and\nquantify--proactively--new and/or emerging risks.\"1\n\nThe new data-centric approach to compliance, while necessary, does come at a\ncost, however. Not only does an intensified focus on data compel a company to\nrethink and redesign its overall processes, it also requires a modernization\nof its infrastructure, software and processes for quality management. But the\ncost of investing in modernization is far outweighed by the cost of\nnoncompliance that will inevitably be caused by unstructured quality data.\n\nRobust digital solutions are leading the charge in the shift to data-driven\ncompliance by enabling life sciences companies to take control of their\nquality data and providing it with a reliable structure. Modern quality\nmanagement systems (QMS) are specifically designed to digitally connect data\nacross the enterprise and drastically simplify any restructuring of quality\nactivities that a company needs to undertake as it strives to make its\ncompliance processes more data driven.\n\n### **Connecting the Life Cycle With Future-Focused Platforms  **\n\nThe current focus on data is bringing software platforms to the fore.\nPlatforms are playing an increasingly larger role in compliance--especially in\nthe life sciences--because they provide greater visibility into and control\nover data. Rather than piecing together disparate applications to coordinate\nmultiple processes and data streams, a platform offers the reassurance of\nnative connectivity and unifies all applications and processes within a common\narchitecture and programming code base.\n\nRunning a variety of applications within a natively integrated operating\nsystem allows a company to take a product life cycle approach to compliance\nand achieve greater governance over its quality management processes. By\ndesign, platforms enable multiple interrelated processes to operate and\nsynchronize within the same digitized framework, which is the primary reason\nplatforms are proving to be the most effective mechanism for mapping data and\nprocess connections across product life cycles.\n\nPlatforms also continue to facilitate innovation and enable organizations to\ntake the concept of \"creating a culture of quality\" to the next level by\ntightly correlating data and processes. They're the ideal means of\nestablishing compliance as a speed-to-market accelerator by enabling companies\nto achieve predictive insights and real-time quality intelligence.\n\nPerhaps more importantly for companies that are poising themselves for growth,\nplatforms facilitate adaptability and expansion when the need to evolve or\npivot becomes warranted. Much like Apple's iTunes platform transformed to\nbecome something far greater than a technology for purchasing and playing\nmusic and Amazon's platform enabled it to become much more than an online\nbookstore, a robust platform for connecting business processes can provide a\nfoundation for appreciable growth. As business processes change or new\nprocesses need to be added, platforms provide the consistency of a baseline\ntechnical framework that can be expanded upon and leveraged to spur\ninnovation.\n\n### **The Future of Compliance Software Platforms**\n\nAs technology continues to transform what is considered to be the modern\napproach to compliance, those companies that were formerly perceived as being\non the cutting edge for shifting from a reactive to a proactive posture are\nbecoming commonplace. The inevitable next step in effective and comprehensive\ncompliance management is the ability to move from a proactive state of\nreadiness toward truly predictive competencies. The digital revolution is\ntaking compliance management to the next level as QMS providers race to\ndevelop data-driven software offerings that feature predictive solutions that\nprovide meaningful quality and compliance intelligence.\n\nGartner Inc.'s latest research outlines several key QMS platform capabilities\nthat will be highly sought after by the industry leaders attempting to\nestablish a pragmatic and data-centered approach to compliance. They include:\n\n  * Functionality that ensures and enforces compliance.\n  * A user interface/user experience (UI/UX) that supports rather than hinders user adoption.\n  * The ability to promote transparency across the enterprise.\n  * Licensing and hosting options.\n  * Capabilities that are favorable toward being inclusive of new technologies without compromising core quality management functionalities.2\n\nLooking down the road, the pioneering companies seeking to differentiate\nthemselves and get products to market ahead of competitors will demand\nsoftware platforms that can provide, at minimum, proficiencies such as:\n\n**Enhanced access to data:** The availability, structure and accessibility of\ndata are becoming increasingly more important. In fact, over half (54%) of\nquality leaders surveyed by the CEB Quality Leadership Council indicated that\nattainability and usefulness are their top priorities in using data to improve\nquality. Critical decision-making is streamlined when the people who need\ntimely quality and compliance data can access it quickly.\n\n**High-value uses for innovative tech:** Finding a way to convert compliance\nand product quality data into real-time intelligence and predictive insights\nwas once just a fantasy. Thanks to the relentless advancement of technology,\nit is the new reality. No-longer-nascent technologies like natural language\nprocessing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are now gaining\nmaturity and expanding companies' options for leveraging their data. Solution\nproviders are continually developing new uses for programs that extract text,\ncontextualize unstructured documents, and other applications that continue to\nopen new avenues for streamlining quality and compliance processes.\n\n**Scalability and adaptability:** In the ever-evolving world of regulatory\ncompliance, there is no such thing as a set-it-and-forget-it system.\nRegulatory and business priorities are always changing, and companies need\nflexible solutions that enable them to keep up with changing circumstances.\nThis concept of compliance solutions needing to be ready for both the present\nand the future was summarized in a recent Deloitte Centre for Health Solutions\nresearch report that stated: \"Compliance systems have to be effective,\nefficient and future-proofed to support existing compliance requirements and\nmitigate new and emerging compliance risks.\"\u2074\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAs the quality world shifts to a data-centric model, no company can afford to\nput compliance and quality processes at risk by relying on outdated methods or\nunproven software. The future of quality lies in data intelligence, and\nreliable software platforms can help companies be ready for a future where\ndata is king.\n\nImplementing a platform with a proven track record can provide the efficiency,\nconnectivity and ease of use that a company needs to conduct and manage\nquality and compliance operations through a single integrated solution. What's\nmore, a robust, future-ready platform can empower companies with the\nadaptability they will need to cope with unrelenting technological\nadvancements and an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\n* * *\n\n_\" The challenge of compliance in life sciences,\" Deloitte Centre for Health\nSolutions, 2015. _\n\n_\" Market Guide for Quality Management System Software,\" Gartner, Inc. 9 Sept.\n2019.

Data analytics has already started to show fruitful\nresults by predicting the impact of coronavirus. To devise an appropriate\npredictive analytics model for analyzing the outbreak, mining medical data\nisn't sufficient, but you also need to get faster and smarter at it. By\nleveraging Quantzig's advanced data analytics solutions that leverage data\nmining and text analytics you will be able to convert bigger datasets into\nactionable insights in a much smaller span of time. We must take note of this\nfact that the healthcare industry doesn't revolve around just physicians and\npatients but also third parties like insurance companies. Secured and\norganized data is a good opportunity for organizations to save money. All they\nneed is to represent their facilities in an accurate way by leveraging\nadvanced data warehousing and data mining solutions.\n\n**_To know why leading Fortune 500 healthcare and pharma companies rely on\nQuantzig when it comes to data warehousing and data mining,_** **_[speak to\nour analytics\nexperts](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quantzig.com%2Fcontact-\nus%3Futm_source%3DBGV2.0W15%26utm_medium%3DBWQ2BGV2.0%26utm_campaign%3DQ2BGV2.0%26utm_term%3Ddata%2520warehousing%2520and%2520data%2520mining%26utm_content%3DDATA%2520WAREHOUSING%2520AND%2520DATA%2520MINING%253A%2520APPLICATIONS%2520AND%2520EMERGING%2520TRENDS%2520YOU%2520NEED%2520TO%2520KNOW&esheet=52200120&newsitemid=20200407005583&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=speak+to+our+analytics+experts&index=3&md5=b9251237468aac72e2e013533fddfa0c)\ntoday._**\n\n**_According to Quantzig's data analysts,_** _\"Despite the opportunities like\nuniversal accessibility and digitalization, the global healthcare system is\nfacing several obstacles due to changes in healthcare requirements.\"_\n\n**_Healthcare data warehousing and data mining might remain an unexplored\nfield and most of the health organizations and researchers are still unaware\nof its benefits.

From the[\ndeclining](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/stock-market-plunge-\ncoronavirus-131812) stock market to remote work mandates and more, business\nleaders everywhere are being forced to rethink how they operate. To stay\nafloat during this time of uncertainty, organizations must recognize which\ndepartment can make the greatest impact. The answer?\n[Sales](https://martechseries.com/?s=Sales). Now more than ever before,\nmeeting Sales quotas is of the utmost importance, and - for businesses to\nemerge from this unprecedented situation in a positive light - Sales\norganizations must throw aside age-old approaches and embrace Virtual Sales\nstrategies.\n\n### **When Face to Face Goes Remote**\n\nThe challenges amid the COVID-19 crisis are two-fold: not only are Sales teams\nfacing heightened pressures to hit quota and produce outbound leads, but - as\nremote work is now a public health necessity - productivity can be a\nchallenge.\n\nSales organizations are historically run primarily from an office, in a face-\nto-face environment. While the process of pursuing outbound leads, managing\ninbound interest and conducting the general [Sales\nprocess](https://martechseries.com/?s=Sales%20process) _can_ be accomplished\nin any environment with a computer available, accountability is an entirely\ndifferent story.\n\n_**Read more:**_[Big Data: The Role of Predictive Analytics in Sales Growth\n](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/sales-intelligence/the-role-of-\npredictive-analytics-in-sales-growth/)\n\nDuring my decades of experience leading [Sales and\nMarketing](https://martechseries.com/?s=Sales%20and%20Marketing) teams, I\u2019ve\nlearned these three methods to promote productivity and help motivate teams to\nproduce optimal results while working in remote settings:\n\n#### **1\\. Take Advantage of Technology**\n\nToday, a number of tools are available at our disposal to track and motivate\nSales reps. My team uses [SalesLoft](https://martechseries.com/?s=SalesLoft),\na [Sales Enablement](https://martechseries.com/?s=Sales%20Enablement) platform\nto drive engagement, and [Ambition](https://ambition.com/), a [Sales\nManagement ](https://martechseries.com/?s=Sales%20Management)platform, to\ngamify the Sales process. [Xactly](https://martechseries.com/?s=Xactly), the\nSales Performance Management (SPM) solution where I am Vice President of\nMarketing, can assess effectiveness by analyzing activity measurements such as\nlogging calls and sending emails. On top of this, using [Zoom\n](https://martechseries.com/?s=Zoom)to conduct virtual daily standups and\n[Slack ](https://martechseries.com/?s=Slack)to continually communicate with\none another helps keep sales representatives engaged and focused.\n\n#### **2\\. Understand the Value of Virtual Leads**\n\nAs social distancing has taken hold, major industry events are being canceled\nleft and right. This begs the question: how important are events? In the Sales\nindustry, events have traditionally been looked to as a necessity, an\nimportant aspect of the job that helps close deals and promotes [lead\ngeneration](https://martechseries.com/?s=lead%20generation).\n\nVirtual interactions are just, if not more valuable than face-to-face\nconversations. With this in mind, Sales organizations, in the long run, may\nwant to reconsider allocating budget toward in-person events and instead\nprioritize virtual events and meetings - which in many cases yield stronger\nresults.\n\nBy removing the physical barriers, we can open meetings and events to anyone,\nanywhere, at any time, and that is the future. Our Xactly Unleashed Virtual\nSummit will be held on June 17, 2020.\n\n#### **3\\. Focus on the Little Things**\n\nAs someone who has worked remotely for 10+ years, I know a thing or two about\nstaying productive in an untraditional atmosphere. It\u2019s important to stick to\na strict schedule and approach each day as if you are heading to an office.\nStart the day by showering, putting on professional attire (no pajamas!) and\nmaking your bed. If possible, have a designated area or desk where you can\nwork every day. Also, consider trying out the[ Pomodoro\nTechnique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-\ntechnique-1598992730). It\u2019s a time-management method that breaks down your\nworkday into intervals separated by short breaks to help minimize distractions\nand optimize productivity.\n\nSales teams are the lifeblood of an organization, and I believe that they can\nhelp lead companies through these trying times. If anything good comes from\nthis situation, it\u2019s this: working from home has forced us to re-evaluate how\nbusinesses operate.

 * [](mailto:?subject=Rise of the Machines: How Big Data is Changing More Than Just Portfolio Management&body=From Nasdaq.com%0D%0A%0D%0AFor years now, the SEC has quietly advanced its data analytics so that the staff is better equipped to examine registrants and identifier outliers. %0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rise-of-the-machines%3A-how-big-data-is-changing-more-than-just-portfolio-management-2020-04)\n\nFor years now, the SEC has quietly advanced its data analytics so that the\nstaff is better equipped to examine registrants and identifier outliers. For\nexample, the Office of Risk Assessment analyzes data in documents such as\nForms ADV and PF. Information from this analysis is used to direct risk-based\nexaminations of registrants, including investment advisers. The Office of\nCompliance Inspections and Examinations also uses data-rich tools such as the\nNational Exam Analytics Tool (NEAT) to improve its review of areas such as\ntrading.\n\nFor policy-making efforts, the various SEC divisions rely on the Office of\nData Science and the Division of Economic Research and Analysis, which\ncollectively maintain the Quantitative Research Analytical Data Support\n(QRADS) program. The rule-making divisions can use the data to direct\nrulemaking or enhance analysis to make rules more effective (and litigation\nproof).\n\nEnforcement also uses data analytics to monitor huge amounts of trading data\nin search of insider trading or market manipulation; it has also used\nartificial intelligence to identify insider trading networks. It all sounds\nvery Orwellian, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what Amazon, Facebook, and Google\ndo to consumers every day.\n\nThe Division of Investment Management uses an internal tool called \u201cMonitoring\nand Analytics GUI for Investment Companies\u201d or MAGIC to pull together data\nsets from registrants and other sources. The staff can use the output of these\ntools to test portfolio compliance against disclosure so that it can identify\noutliers, and provide that information to OCIE or Enforcement. New forms of\ninformation, such as Form N-PORT and N-CEN, will no doubt give the staff the\nability to monitor other aspects of fund portfolios, such as liquidity. And if\nthis is what the U.S. Government can do with data, imagine what today\u2019s\ncutting-edge companies are doing with it.\n\n**The impact of technology on compliance**\n\nTechnology allows compliance officers to quickly access the data they need to\ntest the various policies and procedures in place. For firms that don\u2019t have\nrobust databases, testing is highly manual and, therefore, slower and more\nexpensive. Additionally, poor data management results in less organization\ntransparency, which can harm internal reporting and oversight.\n\nIn today\u2019s compliance environment, transparency and data are directly related\nand essential to managing risks. Better data means better transparency and\nclear visibility into risks, trends, and other insights that allow compliance\nofficers to manage risks. Easily accessible data results in improved\nmonitoring, which in turn allows for quicker identification of issues. By\ndetecting issues earlier, compliance officers can react before the issue\ncreates a reportable event. Additionally, better data allows compliance\nofficers to cut through the noise and evaluate helpful information.\n\nTechnology not only helps with performance, but it also acts as a cost\nreducer. As a firm grows, they generate more activity and data. If your data\nentry and oversight processes are manual, then growth requires more people to\nmanage these processes, and costs increase. With scalable technology, the\nadviser\u2019s current systems can manage the increases in activity and data and\nstill provide the overseers with valuable reporting; in other words, the\nscalable technology makes the overseers more scalable. Together, the people\nand their machines can do more without adding substantial costs to the firm\u2019s\noperating structure.\n\nTechnology can also reduce turnover rates among staff. Generally speaking, no\none enjoys data entry and manual testing. People are more interested in\nanalyzing trends and other developments so they can use their powerful\ncognitive skills to create solutions. They are also freed to do other work\nthat can both enhance their satisfaction and add more value to the business.\nFor example, they can participate in client relations, product development,\nand marketing in a more effective way.\n\n**How compliance officers are deploying machines**\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA) is well established in today\u2019s technology.\nWhether it\u2019s chatbots, smart inboxes, or other software that create virtual\nfill-in-the-blank, RPA is already impacting today\u2019s asset managers. Marketing\nand CRM tools increasingly use these processes, as do social media, which is\nincreasingly important to growth.\n\nMachine learning is the current frontier of compliance. Many Fintech firms,\nJoot included, are looking for ways to leverage the large data sets that their\nclients produce so that rules-based algorithms can be further leveraged to\nimprove compliance oversight and risk management.\n\nWithout getting into too much technical detail, techniques such as machine\nlearning or deep learning can train a computer to identify trends that may be\ntoo complex for the human mind to track. Additionally, it can eliminate\ncertain low-level tasks, such as image identification and text recognition.\nInstead of a compliance officer who needs to review every piece of\nadvertising, an algorithm could be used to identify potential issues and\nnotify a compliance officer that further investigation is needed. Similarly,\npredictive analytics can be used to forecast activity in ways that are\ndifficult for people to do with their current tools. Compliance could apply\nthese techniques to processes such as risk assessments and annual reviews.\n\nBoth machine learning and predictive analytics require huge data sets to\nprovide helpful results, and that\u2019s where the biggest issues lie for many\nasset managers. Most of the industry is comprised of small to middle-sized\nmanagers that do not produce enough data to develop a better process. Firms\nlike Joot seek to eliminate this barrier by aggregating data from many small\nfirms.\n\nThere are a few questions that you should consider when evaluating technology\nfor your firm.\n\n  1. Who on your team is needed to evaluate and onboard the technology?\n  2. If it\u2019s a cross-functional team, is everyone committed to the project?\n  3. What are some of the issues that could derail the integration?\n  4. Who owns the technology, you, or the vendor?\n  5. Who at your firm is responsible for the technology, even if its ownership resides with a vendor?\n  6. Who will lead the vendor due diligence at the outset and on an ongoing basis?\n  7. How easy is the integration? Will it take days, weeks, or months?\n  8. How much training is needed to get your staff used to the tool and its functions?\n  9. What data formats, systems, and sources does the technology rely upon?\n  10. How are those various points connected, and what securities protocols are in place at each node?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf I could leave you with one thought, it is this: The asset management\nindustry is being permanently changed by data analytics, and small and middle-\nsized firms need to figure out how they are going to keep up with the\naccelerating use of these tools. These firms need to realize that building\ninternal systems is not adequate because the data sets are too weak and the\nsystems too expensive to build on a small scale. Big data is just that, big!\nFurther, it\u2019s just the first phase of the data revolution occurring in our\nindustry.\n\nThe next phase will increasingly leverage artificial intelligence that layers\nonto machine learning and predictive analytics. This advanced layer will bring\nthe machines closer to human intelligence but with the huge advantages of\nlongevity and scale. More importantly, these tools will be freed from well-\nstructured data sets. Instead, artificial intelligence will, as people, be\nable to take unstructured information and glean insights. These insights will\nimprove the previously developed tools like robotic process automation and\nmachine learning. Phase one is like a student reading a library of books to\nlearn about a subject. Phase two is like the student finding a master\ninstructor to accelerate their learning and understanding of all the\ninformation on that subject.

As data generation has\nbeen continuously experiencing an upward trend, power utility companies are\ncombining big data with billions of more rows of additional IoT and smart\nsensor data. The data gathered from smart meters can provide a better\nunderstanding of customer behaviour, and hence, facilitate customer\nsegmentation.  \n  \n **Key Highlights**  \n\n  * Growing investment in smart grid projects drives the market. According to the IEA (International Energy Agency), the world electricity demand is anticipated to increase by nearly 80% between 2012 and 2040. Expansion, modernization, and decentralization of the electricity infrastructure for improved resiliency are the planned investments from organizations. The power grid infrastructure is progressively becoming more digitized and connected, thereby, ensuring the reliable and secure flow of critical digital communications. Moreover, various projects have begun to take place across the Indian subcontinent, aimed at removing issues faced by the population regarding electricity.\n  * Enormous influx of data drives the market growth. According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to enable being smart, a massive amount of data is exchanged between grid components and the enterprise systems that manage these components. Based on the application, information exchanged helps economically optimized bidirectional power flow between a utility and its customers.\n  * Also, according to a survey published by Bridge Energy in 2019, 93% of utility vendors are expecting the availability of solutions to analyze and process data within their company. Furthermore, smart grids collect much more data than the manual energy meter reading system. This permits the use of data analysis techniques and the preparation of highly realistic consumption forecast, as many more variables are taken into account. Therefore, the opportunities for smart grid analytics are expanding because there is an exponential increase in the amount of data available, in order to develop analytical models.\n  * High costs of smart grid systems and lack of skilled professionals restraints the growth of the market. The most prominent limitation in smart metering is the availability of capital funding. Smart systems are comparatively expensive than the regular metering equipment that is employed by most of the service providers and users. Further, different smart meters are designed with various parameters, based on the operational requirements and consumer requirements, which inhibits as a complicated equipment that needs skilled labor for handling and installation.\n\n**Major Market Trends**  \n  \n ** _Metering Solution Expected to Hold Significant Market Growth_**\n\n  * The increasing smart grid investments and the surge in the rate of integration of renewable sources of power generation to the existing grids, along with increasing R&D refurbishment activities in developed economies, are expected to support the growth of the global smart metering analytics market.\n  * The continually evolving government framework and policies are increasing the rate of installations in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Countries, such as China and the United States have witnessed a high-scale deployment of smart meters, mainly due to the continuous support from the respective governments. The aforementioned factors are expected to drive the demand for analytic solutions to handle the vast data from these smart meters.\n  * The Private US-based utility companies, such as ConEd and Duke, are witnessing significant growth in smart meter deployments. This is evident by the fact that smart meters deployed by utilities in the United States reached about 98 million at the end of 2019 and will reach 107 million by the end of 2020 (Edison Foundation Institute for Electric Innovation Estimates).\n  * Furthermore, in 2019, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd, the energy services company under the Union Ministry of Power, replaced about 50,000 conventional electricity meters with smart meters in the New Delhi Municipal Council area, India. This will result in the generation of more data per year. The Chinese State Grid Corporation also planned to install 380 million smart meters in the country by 2020. Owing to these factors, the market studied is expected to witness growth during the forecast period.\n\n**_Asia-Pacific to Witness the Fastest Growth_**\n\n  * The Asia-Pacific region is being dominated by two highly populated country i.e. India and China. The rising population in countries like China, Japan, and India has stimulated the demand for residential infrastructure and electricity consumption, therefore accelerating the demand for electricity in the nations are backing the usage of smart grids which in return will create a market for smart grid data analytics.\n  * The emergence of smart cities is expected to add to the region's competencies in the market. South Korea decided to invest USD 350 million in 300 companies to help develop an IoT ecosystem within the country. A pilot is being launched in a town southeast of Seoul, in partnership with Samsung Electronics and SK Telecom, to setup IoT-based infrastructure for renewable energy.\n  * Further, one of Thailand's major utilities is planning to use data from smart grids and smart meters to track and predict electricity outages in the future. This will help improve the distribution of power to customers\n  * Moreover, in July 2019, a Switzerland-based smart grid company, DEPsys, opened its second subsidiary, DEPsys Ptd Ltd, in Singapore. This subsidiary is expected to meet the needs of distribution system operators (DSOs) in Asia-Pacific by contributing to the digitization of grids.\n  * Also, in August 2019, Itron partnered with the government-owned utility, Western Power, in Australia to connect around 240,000 electricity meters. This partnership will help the utility provider gain visibility into the operation of its electricity distribution network, enabling automated data collection, new remote services, and the ability to proactively monitor faults and outages.\n  * Therefore, all the above factors combined will fuel the smart grid market which in return will boost the smart grid data analytics market in the Asia-Pacific region during the forecasted period.\n\n**Competitive Landscape**  \n  \nThe smart grid data analytics market is fragmented and highly competitive in\nnature. Owing to the emergence of new startups offering a broad range of\ninnovative solutions catering to diverse industry requirements, the market is\nwitnessing intensifying competitive rivalry. Also as the major players are\nconsidered to be synonymous with good performance, they are expected to have a\ncompetitive edge. Key players are Siemens, Itron, IBM Corporation, etc.  \n  \n **Some recent developments in this market are:**\n\n  * Oct 2019 - Uptake partnered with Symboticware to provide mining companies with an end-to-end, integrated AI, and data science solution to increase the productivity of mobile mining equipment. The joint solution combines Symboticware's SymBot device, which provides comprehensive data capture from mining fleets, and Uptake's Asset Performance Management (APM) software, Asset IO, which applies AI to surface predictive insights from the data.\n  * Jan 2020 - Itron, Inc. signed a contract with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to improve grid awareness and reduce operating costs. Through this partnership, LADWP will deploy Itron's Industrial IoT network and Distribution Automation (DA) solution with the aim of modernizing its grid.\n\n**Key Topics Covered**  \n  \n**1 INTRODUCTION**  \n1.1 Study Assumptions  \n1.2 Scope of the Study  \n  \n **2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**  \n  \n **3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  \n  \n **4 MARKET DYNAMICS**  \n4.1 Market Overview  \n4.2 Market Drivers  \n4.2.1 Growing Investments in Smart Grid Projects  \n4.2.2 Enormous Influx of Data  \n4.3 Market Challenges  \n4.3.1 High Costs of Smart Grid Systems and Lack of Skilled Professionals  \n4.4 Industry Value Chain Analysis  \n4.5 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis  \n4.5.1 Threat of New Entrants  \n4.5.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers  \n4.5.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers  \n4.5.4 Threat of Substitute Products  \n4.5.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry  \n  \n**5 MARKET SEGMENTATION**  \n5.1 By Deployment  \n5.1.1 Cloud-Based  \n5.1.2 On-premise  \n5.2 By Solution  \n5.2.1 Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Network  \n5.2.2 Metering  \n5.2.3 Customer Analytics  \n5.3 By Application  \n5.3.1 Advanced Metering Infrastructure Analysis  \n5.3.2 Demand Response Analysis  \n5.3.3 Grid Optimization Analysis  \n5.4 By End-user Vertical  \n5.4.1 Private Sector (SMEs and Large Enterprises)  \n5.4.2 Public Sector  \n5.5 Geography  \n5.5.1 North America  \n5.5.2 Europe  \n5.5.3 Asia-Pacific  \n5.5.4 Latin America  \n5.5.5 Middle-East and Africa  \n  \n **6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**  \n6.1 Company Profiles  \n6.1.1 Siemens AG  \n6.1.2 Itron Inc.  \n6.1.3 AutoGrid Systems Inc.  \n6.1.4 General Electric Company  \n6.1.5 IBM Corporation  \n6.1.6 SAP SE  \n6.1.7 Tantalus System Corporation  \n6.1.8 SAS Institute Inc.  \n6.1.9 Hitachi Ltd.  \n6.1.10 Uplight Inc.  \n6.1.11 Landis & Gyr Group AG  \n6.1.12 Uptake Technologies Inc.  \n6.1.13 Schneider Electric SE  \n6.1.14 Oracle Corporation  \n6.1.15 Amdocs Corporation  \n6.1.16 Sensus USA Inc.

** _Predictive Workflow Platform Provides Coronavirus Alerts, Clinical\nVisibility, and Reduces Time in the EHR and Physician Burnout_**\n\n[Wellsheet\nInc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsheet.com&esheet=52200158&newsitemid=20200407005423&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Wellsheet+Inc.&index=1&md5=3b74303e5f1224d7b7bd2099c31cb1ab), the\ncompany transforming the Electronic Health Record (EHR) experience, announced\ntoday that their predictive clinical workflow platform is supporting\nphysicians at Concord Hospital in New Hampshire during the Coronavirus\npandemic. Wellsheet provides real-time diagnostic result alerts; visibility of\nall patients being tested or confirmed with COVID-19 by location, by attending\nphysician, and by associated isolation status; and reduced exposure through\nshared workspaces. Concord Hospital is tracking every potential Coronavirus\npatient from admissions through discharge with Wellsheet, which reduces the\naverage time physicians must spend in the EHR chart. This is especially\ncritical as exhausted clinicians are being pushed to the limits providing care\nto patients with long hours and limited supplies and equipment.\n\n\"Wellsheet is integrated with our EHR and is being used by the physicians on\nthe front line at Concord Hospital battling COVID-19. It provides our\nclinicians with a real-time snapshot, like an \"air-traffic controller,\" of the\nkey data they need on every potential Coronavirus patient, and has enabled us\nto better allocate resources. With Wellsheet, doctors have the data they need\nin one place, enabling them to quickly make the right clinical decisions,\"\nsaid Dr. Paul Clark, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer (CMIO) at Concord\nHospital. \"Wellsheet on our iPads, phones and computers has been invaluable to\nour physicians during this outbreak providing our patients quicker response\ntimes and clinical decisions based on the best data available.\"\n\n\"The health workers at Concord Hospital are truly heroes in this global\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and Wellsheet is humbled that we are part of Concord\u2019s\narsenal today as they fight for their patients and the well-being of their\nclinicians,\" said [Craig Limoli, CEO\n](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fcraig-\nlimoli%2F&esheet=52200158&newsitemid=20200407005423&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Craig+Limoli%2C+CEO&index=2&md5=6efefbc14f8bc7425492e0224bd00aee)and\nfounder of Wellsheet. \"We are grateful to visionaries like Dr. Clark and an\ninnovative organization like Concord Hospital, who recognize at the highest\nlevel, and are addressing, the importance of clinician well-being and\n[reducing physician\nburnout.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsheet.com%2Fdr-\ncassel-on-physician-wellness&esheet=52200158&newsitemid=20200407005423&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=reducing+physician+burnout.&index=3&md5=9daf43a20fa5ba72fb46f3281d302647)\"\n\nWellsheet\u2019s [predictive clinical workflow\nplatform](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsheet.com%2Fproduct&esheet=52200158&newsitemid=20200407005423&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=predictive+clinical+workflow+platform&index=4&md5=a73b6cfb9eea9942d26e943cbb1886e0)\npulls data from the EHR, prioritizes clinical content through specialized\nmachine learning algorithms, and optimizes the provider workflow. Wellsheet\nassembles pertinent information in a meaningful way, anticipating the needs of\nthe doctor to help facilitate a more effortless episode of care. It assembles\nthe right information in an intuitive workflow that allows doctors and nurses\nto arrive at the right clinical insights. Having this layer on top of the EHR\ngives clinicians the ability to understand what needs to be done for the\npatient right in front of them without having to compromise the provider-\npatient interaction.\n\n **Ease of implementation**\n\nTraditional implementation timelines to integrate new technology with the EHR\nare usually prolonged, cumbersome and costly affairs. Wellsheet uses the Fast\nHealthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming\ninterfaces (APIs), and can pull and prioritize key patient data from multiple\ndata sources for an accelerated implementation and deployment timeline.

with Nick Elprin, co-founder and CEO of [Domino\nData Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/), which was recently named to Wing\nVenture Capital\u2019s [Enterprise Tech 30](https://www.nasdaq.com/Enterprise-\nTech-30) list.\n\n**What prompted you to start Domino, and what opportunity did you see?**\n\nMy co-founders and I spent many years building software to help quants inside\na large hedge fund accelerate their research and collaborate better. We saw\nhow big of an impact data science had when it was used to drive the heart of a\nbusiness, and when researchers were enabled and empowered with great\ntechnology. As we talked to other companies scaling their data science teams,\nwe saw how much time and energy they were wasting (dealing with dev ops,\nreinventing the wheel, reproducing past work), and we wanted to give them a\nplatform to unleash their full potential. ****\n\n**How quickly are Fortune 500 companies adopting data science and machine\nlearning?**\n\nVery rapidly. One of the striking trends we\u2019re seeing is rapid adoption in\nindustries that aren\u2019t typically considered early adopters. For example, while\nwe\u2019ve seen data science and ML for years in finance and life sciences, we\u2019re\nnow seeing more urgent adoption in manufacturing, telecommunications, retail\nand transportation. We are working with one of the large automakers who\ndescribed their \u201cpent up demand for data science across the business\u201d: they\nsee so many opportunities for data science to impact their business that they\ncan\u2019t grow their data science team fast enough to keep up.\n\nOf course, with that urgent need to scale a data science organization,\ncompanies run into another set of problems. What we see across the enterprises\nwe work with is that when you reach scale, the biggest challenges aren\u2019t about\nfinding a faster algorithm \u2014 rather, the big challenge is about how to help\nlarge teams collaborate and work together more effectively, to ensure\nincreasing returns on investment as the team scales.\n\n**How are people using Domino to help in the fight against COVID-19?**\n\nTwo ways:\n\nFirst, with data science teams across the country now working from home, every\nteam is a distributed team. As difficult of a shift as that is, we are very\nproud of the fact that Domino makes remote collaboration so much easier.\nHaving data science work in a central collaboration platform facilitates\ndistributed work and has made the work-from-home transition easier for all our\ncustomers.\n\nSecond, many of our customers are in the life sciences space, and several of\nthem are using Domino to research COVID-19 treatments; other customers of ours\nin the finance space are using Domino to build models to predict spread and\ngrowth.\n\nWe know it\u2019s a small fraction of the impact that health care workers on the\nfront lines of the pandemic are having, but we\u2019re proud to be contributing, in\nsome small way, to helping our customers through this crisis. We also recently\nannounced that we\u2019re offering complimentary access to organizations that are\nadvancing the collective understanding of the COVID-19 virus, its spread, and\napproaches to lessening its destructive effects across the population. Doing\nwhat we can to assist health and life science organizations during this\noutbreak means a lot to us.\n\n**What role can data science play in helping to keep people informed?**\n\nData scientists have a skillset that integrates statistical methods,\nprogramming, and data visualization \u2014 that gives them a unique ability to tell\nstories in visually compelling ways, that help people understand complex and\nsubtle topics.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing this first hand with the COVID-19 pandemic. Exponential growth is\nan un-intuitive concept for most people. And for those of us who aren\u2019t on the\nfrontlines of the pandemic, it can be hard to appreciate the sense of scale\nand urgency we\u2019re facing.\n\nData scientists and data journalists have stepped up to create valuable\nvisualizations and analysis to give the broader population and more visceral\nunderstanding of the crises. Some of my favorite examples of the work from\nJohn Burn-Murdoch at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-\nlatest) and the [interactive\ndashboards](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\nthat the team at Johns Hopkins has built. The NYTimes also has a wealth of\ninnovative and insightful data visualizations.\n\n**What does it mean to your company to be listed on the Enterprise Tech 30?**\n\nIt\u2019s a validation of our focus on enabling enterprise data science\norganizations, and it reminds me of how proud I am of how Domino fuels the\nprogressive change that our customers are making in the world through their\ninnovative research. Enterprises have a huge set of use cases and applications\nthat benefit from the predictive learning efficiencies of data science, many\nof which have real impact on people\u2019s daily lives. Examples include managing\nthe supply chain to meet demand, automation to improve customer experience,\nhelping reduce insurance rates, or developing new medicine (several of our\ncustomers use Domino to research COVID-19, in fact). I am incredibly\noptimistic and excited about the impact that data science will have on the\nworld over the coming years.\n\n![Enterprise Tech 30 Domino Data\nLab](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n### Popular Insights\n\n[ AT&T Inc.

While the medical response is only now\nplaying out in the U.S., the ramifications will likely add urgency to the\nnetwork of sensors required to enhance hospital automation and remote patient\nmonitoring.\n\n According to Kagan's latest forecast, medical IoT revenue in U.S. hospitals\nis poised to grow at a CAGR of 18.6%, from $136 million in 2019 to $319.3\nmillion in 2024. Price pressure from governments, insurance companies and\npatients is driving the growth of IoT revenue in U.S. hospitals that will\nbetter keep expensive machines running, automate the communication of patient\nvital signs, and track hospital equipment and personnel.\n\nMedical IoT refers to sensors, electronics and communications technologies\nthat enable network connectivity in the device, and IoT revenue refers only to\nthe revenue generated by this technology, not the value of the underlying\ndevices. While this results in revenue numbers that are not particularly\nlarge, the capability of the device itself is significantly changed. Medical\nIoT is key to the future of healthcare delivery in the hospital, where it\nmight assist with uploading the heart rate from a patient awaiting surgery,\ntracking the need for maintenance in a CT scanner, or notifying staff of the\nlocation of wheelchairs within a ward via radio tags. Note that, due to\nmedical security issues such as the dangers of hacked equipment and the need\nto maintain patient privacy, medical IoT does not necessarily mean\ntransmission of data to the cloud. However, it does require at least\nautomating and tracking certain hospital functions via the use of an internal\nhospital network.\n\nThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is affecting every aspect of the\nhealth care system and should accelerate the adoption of medical IoT in\nhospitals. Medical IoT will help by automating the recording of patient vital\nsigns, such as pulse, respiration and blood pressure, allowing closer, more\nfrequent monitoring of this data than is possible manually by hospital staffs.\nThis will help better track patients in distress, as well as allowing hospital\npersonnel to spend more time on those patients.\n\n\n\n![](/marketintelligence/en/news-\ninsights/blog/easset_upload_file84820_1443859_e.png)\n\nThe market for IoT in the hospital includes the following three segments:\n\n**Predictive maintenance**\n\nThe first market for hospital-based IoT is the use of predictive maintenance\nto avoid downtime on major medical equipment, such as magnetic resonance\nimagers (MRI), CAT scanners, x-ray machines and other types of high-end\nimaging devices. The cost of these machines can range from several thousand to\nmillions of dollars, and keeping them running is key to the efficient\nperformance of the hospital. And because of their cost, guaranteeing uptime\nvia IoT can save hospitals significant money by reducing the need to outsource\nscans or even the need to purchase additional machines to cover for out-of-\nservice units.\n\nThrough IoT, these high-end imagers are monitored via the cloud using the same\npredictive maintenance principles that are utilized for industrial equipment.\nThe machine can be equipped with sensors, electronics and communications\ntechnology to monitor out-of-spec performance in terms of machine vibration,\ntemperature, voltage, current or other parameters. If the performance is out\nof specification in a key way, the hospital and manufacturer can be notified,\nand a technician can be called to initiate repairs before the machine is taken\nout of commission.\n\nFor example, Philips Healthcare's e-Alert system actively monitors the\ncompany's advanced imaging systems. It employs IoT sensors to monitor MRI\nmachine parameters, which are checked remotely by Philips Healthcare\npersonnel, allowing service technicians to be notified to make repairs in\nperson, or remotely via software, before the problem becomes more serious. In\naddition, the sensor data generated by one machine's problem can be shared\nwith technicians of all machines of that type anywhere in the world, helping\nto guarantee uptime for other devices.\n\n**Vital Sign Monitoring**\n\nVital sign monitors encompass many of the most common tech devices in a\nhospital. Basic devices measure body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate\nand blood pressure. More advanced devices might measure oxygen or other gas\nlevels, heart and brain activity, or the quantity of fluids entering a\npatient. __ Typically, a nurse must record a patient's basic vital signs\nmultiple times per day. There is a move toward integrating network capability\ninto devices, through options such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to\nautomatically record these measurements. This information then is uploaded to\nthe patient's electronic medical record in the hospital network.\n\nDuring shift changes, it is very important that vital sign data be recorded\nand passed to the next nurse on duty. If the information or documents are\nmisinterpreted, the patient might be endangered by issues such as medication\ndosage errors. Because of this, vital sign monitoring based on IoT can both\nreduce the nurse's workload and improve patient interactions by avoiding\ncommunication errors.\n\nThis transition to automated vital sign monitoring via IoT may be accelerated\nby the recent COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. IoT offers several advantages in\nhospital care. First, vital signs can be read more frequently, allowing\npatients to be monitored more closely than by hospital staff checking them on\ntheir rounds. It also limits routine interactions between staff and sick\npatients, limiting the potential for staff to become ill. And by limiting the\nroutine duties of hospital staff, it allows them to focus more on patient\ncare.\n\nForm factors of vital sign monitors are evolving. Some vital signs monitors\nare becoming portable, and attached to the patient's hand or wrist, making for\nmore of a wearable device. These devices by necessity must have some type of\nwireless technology to transmit this information. Another example is wireless,\ndisposable sensors on the patient's body to measure heart rate, respiration,\nand other vital signs. In addition, sensors in the bed can track patient's\nbasic vital signs, such as heart and respiration, as well as tracking the\nlevel of patient movement in bed.\n\n**Asset Tracking**\n\nAsset tracking refers to the use of RFID tags and readers to track people and\nequipment within a hospital. Though originally designed for tracking goods\nwithin a supply chain in an industrial environment, it has emerged over the\npast 10 - 15 years as a primary method of asset and human tracking within the\nhospital. A system of RF tags can be attached to patient wristbands, staff\nname tags and many types of hospital equipment. These tags connect to readers\ninstalled on walls and ceilings around the hospital, allowing for tracking of\npeople and goods throughout the hospital. Tags can be attached to large\ndevices, including portable medical equipment and beds, as well as patient\nsamples that are sent for testing. RFID can save money and time by tracking\nthe movements of goods, patients and staff throughout the hospital in real\ntime, allowing staff more time to focus on patient care.\n\nIn addition to higher-cost items, supplies that require periodic replenishment\ncan also be monitored so that the hospital does not run out of supplies.\nTracking offers the additional bonus of allowing the hospital to lower its\ninventory levels on supplies, thus lowering overall costs. For example,\nsupplies such as chemicals and gases can be monitored through the use of tags\nand sensors. In addition, more low-cost, disposable items, such as syringes,\ngloves, and masks can be monitored.\n\n**Forecast**\n\nThe revenue forecast for IoT in all three segments can be seen in the chart\nbelow. Predictive maintenance is promising, increasing at a CAGR of 15.0% from\n2019 to 2024. The primary limiting factor in this segment is the relatively\nsmall number of devices compared to other medical IoT segments. Predictive\nmaintenance is necessarily limited to the high-cost machines that benefit from\nclosely monitoring internal performance via sensors and electronics to track\nthe machine's condition.\n\nIoT revenue for vital signs monitoring is expected to increase at a CAGR of\n13.7%, with the assumption that the COVID-19 virus pandemic will help drive\nIoT adoption in the segment. Adding IoT to these devices can be a significant\nportion of overall device cost, so the need must be justified. The ability to\ntransmit this data regularly via network can reduce hospital workload while\nalso increasing patient safety, by instantly informing hospital staff when\npatients' vital signs are abnormal. Taking some routine work from nurses\nallows them to focus more on patient care.\n\nThe revenue forecast for IoT in asset tracking in hospitals is quite\npromising, at just over 26% annually from 2019 to 2024.  This revenue growth\nexceeds that for the two other primary hospital IoT segments due to the total\navailable market size. RFID tags can potentially be used on every single\nindividual, piece of equipment, sample and box of supplies in an entire\nhospital, making the potential market enormous. And asset tracking can save\nmoney and increase efficiency in several ways. By better tracking equipment,\nlosses can be reduced. And by tracking employees and patients, hospital\npersonnel can be directed to where they are needed, increasing staff\nefficiency.\n\n![](/marketintelligence/en/news-\ninsights/blog/easset_upload_file71703_1443859_e.png)\n\n###### Learn more about Market Intelligence\n\nRequest Demo\n\n    *     *   * Author\n  * [Brian O\u2019Rourke](/marketintelligence/contributors/1195031/brian-o-rourke)\n  * Theme\n  * [Technology, Media & Telecom](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Technology%2c+Media+%26+Telecom&fn=custom_ss_theme)\n  * Segment\n  * [Corporations](/marketintelligence/en/client-segments/corporations)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n#\n\n  * ### \n\n#\n\n  * [About Us](/marketintelligence/en/about/index)\n  * [ Quality Program](/marketintelligence/en/campaigns/quality-program)\n  * [Contact Us](/marketintelligence/en/contact-us/index)\n  * [Email Subscription Center](https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/SPGMI-Email-Subscription-Center.html)\n  * [Press Releases](/marketintelligence/en/media-center/index)\n\n  * [Careers]()\n  * [Corporate Responsibility]()\n  * [Our History](/en/who-we-are/our-history)\n  * [Investor Relations](http://investor.spglobal.com/)\n  * [Leadership](https://www.spglobal.com/en/who-we-are/our-people/our-leadership#sp-global-market-intelligence)\n\n  * [__](https://twitter.com/SPGMarketIntel)\n  * [__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/162892/)\n  * [__](https://www.facebook.com/sandpglobal/)\n  * [__](https://www.youtube.com/user/SPCapitalIQ)\n\n  * (C) 2020 S&P;

Johnson](https://venturebeat.com/author/kjohnson/ \"Posts by Khari\nJohnson\")[@kharijohnson](https://www.twitter.com/kharijohnson) April 2, 2020\n9:47 AM\n\n![Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI coronavirus conference held April\n1, 2020](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stanford-hai-\ncoronavirus.png?fit=800%2C400&strip=all)\n\nStanford Institute for Human-Centered AI coronavirus conference held April 1,\n2020\n\nThe Stanford Institute of Human-Centered AI (HAI) hosted a conference to\ndiscuss applications of AI that governments, technologists, and public health\nofficials are using to save human lives during the global coronavirus\npandemic. Based on current mitigation efforts, the U.S. \u2014 which has more cases\nthan any other country on Earth \u2014 could see 100,000 to 240,000 deaths over the\ncoming months, according to a White House estimate released earlier this week.\n\nAlso prevalent on the minds of experts throughout the day-long digital event\nWednesday was the level of surveillance that\u2019s necessary, or tolerable, for\ntracking people with confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI think on the technology side we can have pre-thought, emergency assignments\nthat enable the administration in any pandemic situation; when the legislature\nagrees, they can have infrastructures such as those at tech companies at their\ndisposal, because if a governor is allowed to [legally command Sheraton to\nshare its hotel beds as\nhospitals](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-12/california-\ngovernor-gavin-newsom-hotels-medical-facilities-patients-meeting-\nrequirements), I believe the governor should be allowed to command a tech\ncompany to share their tracking infrastructure for public health for a limited\nperiod of time,\u201d said Dr. Nigam Shah, whose work at Stanford focuses on\nmachine learning models that predict things like available hospital beds.\n\nStanford University professor and Center for Innovation in Global Health\ndirector Dr. Michele Barry gave a snapshot of how countries around the world\nhave responded to COVID-19, sometimes in ways that may be considered invasive\nin the United States.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re all worried about in some of the more authoritarian\ncountries \u2026 is that it\u2019s often hard to unroll strict laws that are made in the\ntime of public health emergencies. It\u2019s very easy to roll them out, but we\u2019re\nall looking with bated breath about what\u2019s going to happen in the future,\u201d\nBarry said.\n\nTopics on the agenda at the conference ranged from AI\u2019s role in the hunt for a\nvaccine to misinformation to bioweapons to applying AI to millions of tweets\nto understand the psychological toll of social distancing and rampant\nunemployment in the past month. Currently, the majority of U.S. citizens, and\nmore than one in five people around the world, are practicing social\ndistancing.\n\nPublic health and government officials are actively considering surveillance,\nquick tech builds, and ways to accelerate research or gain predictive\ninsights. Last week, WHO executive director Dr. Michael Ryan said surveillance\nis part of what\u2019s required for life to return to normal in a world without a\nvaccine. [Countries hit hard by coronavirus in the past few months have\nadopted smartphone apps](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/24/dont-like-\ndystopian-surveillance-flatten-the-coronavirus-curve/) or other means of\ntracking the movement of people diagnosed with COVID-19, such as wearable\nwristbands.\n\nStanford HAI codirector Dr. Fei-Fei Li described one solution for tracking.\nIt\u2019s an AI-powered, in-home COVID-19 monitoring and tracking system designed\nfor seniors who live alone, and for the people who care for them but who have\nto minimize contact to reduce the risk of infection. The system is built with\ncameras and smart sensors that track biometric information like temperature,\ntelltale body movements, and sleep patterns. It sends the data to a secure\ncentral server, where AI models search for clinically relevant patterns. Then,\nthe system would alert caregivers to any pertinent results \u2014 perhaps via an\napp.\n\nTina White, a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, said oppressive\nsurveillance she read about in February concerning China\u2019s coronavirus app\ninspired her to action. The [COVID Watch app for iOS and Android\nsmartphones](https://covid-watch.org/) uses the Bluetooth protocol for\nmeasuring close contact between individuals. Privacy advocates prefer\nBluetooth because it\u2019s a decentralized way to share information locally on\nsmartphone devices and could be more effective than GPS at tracking movement\nindoors, where people are more likely to transmit the virus. When a person\nreceives a positive test, they share their contact number in the app, and\nanyone they came in close proximity to receives a notification.\n\nThe COVID Watch app open-sources its code to give people in other countries\nthe choice to make their own version. Researchers from eight European\ncountries also recently [open-sourced PEPP-PT](https://www.pepp-pt.org/), the\nPan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, which also uses Bluetooth.\n\n\u201cOur approach was designed so you don\u2019t have to collect identifying\ninformation about an individual in order to use it. So our data set is kind of\nspecial because there\u2019s no actual identifying information, it\u2019s just these\nanonymous contact event numbers which are then deleted after a couple weeks\nand are only interpretable by the individual phones,\u201d White said. \u201cSo it\u2019s\nonly an intervention and not something that generates a data set, which is\nkind of what we were aiming for \u2014 something that\u2019s so private that we can\u2019t\neven interpret it ourselves. It\u2019s only interpretable by the phones that were\nlocally involved in the contact events.\u201d\n\nThe COVID Watch team is working with the makers of TraceTogether, who on March\n20 in Singapore launched the first national app for using Bluetooth to track\nproximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases. The team is also working with creators\nof MIT\u2019s PrivateKit: Safe Paths and Community Epidemiology in Action (CoEpi).\n\nStanford professor and Center for Policy, Outcomes and Prevention director\nJason Wang held up Taiwan as proof that you can track COVID-19 cases without\nautocracy. He said the key to some of the lowest mortality and infection rates\nin the world is low-tech solutions like preparedness and understanding when\nevidence on the ground demands quick, decisive action. Officials in Taiwan are\nusing heavy fines and [phone tracking](https://qz.com/1825997/taiwan-phone-\ntracking-system-monitors-55000-under-coronavirus-quarantine/), as well as the\nCommunicable Disease Controls Act, a law approved by lawmakers in 2003 after\nthe breakout of SARS. In Taiwan, people can use maps supplied by government\nofficials to see the local face mask supply. Infrared scanners in buildings,\nand text messages sent to people in the vicinity of confirmed cases, are also\nin use.\n\n## Repurposing research\n\nEfforts by academics and researchers scrambling to redesign or repurpose\nexisting solutions to fight COVID-19 was also a major topic of discussion.\n\nRyan Tibshirani leads the [Delphi Group](https://delphi.midas.cs.cmu.edu/) at\nCarnegie Mellon University, which is one of two CDC centers for excellence in\nthe U.S. that create models for tracking the flu. Tibshirani said his group\nproduced some of the most accurate flu prediction models in previous CDC Flu\nsimulation competitions, but he added that this year, the group is adapting.\nDelphi Group plans to make coronavirus-tracking models at the county level in\nthe United States available in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThere are models that take things like [influenza-like illness] ([ILI)\nprevalence](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm) that can then predict\nhospitalizations, predict critical hospitalizations, predict deaths, and these\nmodels are very well established for influenza. The question is, if we can\ntrain them fast enough \u2026 by \u2018fast\u2019 I mean, do we have enough training data to\nmake useful forecasts for coronavirus?\u201d he said.\n\nSymptom surveys or screeners are not the same thing as a positive\nconfirmation, but Tibshirani said symptom tracking can still be very useful.\nDetermining whether a person has an ILI is important information right now\nsince the majority of people with coronavirus show signs of fever, sore\nthroat, and cough.\n\nMore surveillance that gathers ILI data, he said, could help fight the\npandemic.\n\n\u201cA national or international surveillance system at this point which is\ncapturing that would be extremely useful,\u201d he said. \u201cData privacy is of course\none of the foremost issues people discuss today, and this is an unfortunate\ntime for this to have been such a big issue, because there are real issues of\nprivacy surrounding sharing of medical data. That being said, what we\u2019ve seen\nin our group \u2014 and I think this is true across, probably, anybody who\u2019s\nworking on COVID modeling and forecasting \u2014 is that there\u2019s been more movement\nand more accomplished in the last two weeks than I\u2019ve seen in years in terms\nof data sharing.\u201d\n\n## Big tech\n\nFollowing a series of presentations on apps for tracking COVID-19, a moderator\nsaid a common question among participants was why data from big tech companies\nwasn\u2019t being used to power more solutions.\n\nThe White House has had conversations with tech companies like Facebook and\nGoogle about data sharing, according to the _Washington Post_.\n\nThe Harvard University and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital epidemiologist John\nBrownstein described numerous projects for real-time COVID-19 mapping that\nrange from conversational bots that ask questions about COVID-19 symptoms to\nsocial media data mining. Research [published in\n_Science_](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/25/science.abb4218)\nlast month used location and movement data from Baidu to prove the\neffectiveness of social distancing. Boston Children\u2019s Hospital is working with\nthe CDC to understand the impact of social distancing and areas. There\u2019s also\n[Covid Near You](https://covidnearyou.org/), an adaptation of Flu Near You\nthat asks people how they\u2019re feeling every day to map people exhibiting\nCOVID-19 symptoms. Since its launch last week, COVID Near You has been used\nmore than 250,000 times, and was built with engineering time donated by\nGoogle, Facebook, and Airbnb.\n\nCooperation from tech companies is \u201cgreat as I\u2019ve ever seen at any point in\ntime,\u201d Brownstein said, but he added that they remain under the same privacy\nand data pressure they\u2019ve faced in the past several years.\n\nBrownstein called the idea of a national surveillance tracking app unlikely\nwithout federal government action.\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to do some of the same types of app-based approaches that we\nsaw in [South] Korea, Israel, and other places without really major federal\nsupport, and I think that\u2019s where there\u2019s potentially a little bit of a\ndisconnect between what\u2019s happening at the federal government level and what\nthey\u2019re trying to push in terms of an app-based contact tracing approach,\u201d\nBrownstein said.\n\nTibshirani said he\u2019s also working with Google on an ILI survey that\u2019s\ncollected about a million responses in the past week or so from people about\nhow they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cI think it requires a giant like Google or another kind of really big tech\ncompany, and I think there are many others of these in the works to adopt one\nsurvey or mode of surveillance and just make it available to everybody. I\nthink that would be really beneficial to the entire community and so we\u2019re\nworking on making that happen,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers focused on epidemiological models described a sense of urgency to\ntweak and adapt models before communities in the southern hemisphere see a\nrise in cases as they enter fall and winter seasons. Scholars with opinions on\nall sides of the surveillance spectrum also described some optimism about\ncooperation happening between academic journals, businesses, and researchers\nin response to COVID-19.\n\n### Top Stories from VentureBeat\n\n[\n\n#### {{title}}\n\n]({{permalink}})\n\n[{{author}}]({{authorLink}})\n\n{{date}}\n\n  * [ VentureBeat Homepage ](/)\n  * [ Follow us on Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/venturebeat/)\n  * [ Follow us on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/venturebeat)\n  * [ Follow us on Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/venturebeat/)\n  * [ Follow us on LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/venturebeat)\n  * [ Follow us on Flipboard ](https://flipboard.com/@venturebeat)\n  * [ Follow us on RSS ](https://feeds.feedburner.com/venturebeat/SZYF)\n\n  * [About](/about/)\n  * [Contact](/contact/)\n  * [Careers](/careers/)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise/)\n  * (C) 2020 [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/).

One where having almost instantaneous access to data\nand the ability to communicate from anywhere has never been more business\ncritical.\n\nLast week, Australia's major telecommunication service providers were granted\nauthorisation by the ACCC to collaborate to keep critical services operating\neffectively during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A welcomed move, as\nAustralia continues its transition to the 'new normal', while also taking\nnecessary steps to mitigate economic impacts.  \n\nWithin New Zealand, major telco operators have made similar moves, covering\neverything from heightened network monitoring through to setting up non-\ncontact retail collection points to keep access to essential products\navailable.  \n\nIn fact, almost overnight, companies throughout Australia and New Zealand are\nhaving to rethink the way they operate every aspect of their business. From\nhow to effectively manage teams of people working in self isolation, to\nrelooking at the way they go to market to maintain delivery of products and\nservices. However, irrespective of the business we are in, our reliance on\ntelecommunications, digital technology platforms and infrastructure has never\nbeen greater.  \n\nThe risk of customer churn is heightened for those whose service delivery\nfalls below expectations. With network optimisation critical, telcos are using\nadvanced data analytics and machine learning to monitor and manage network\ncapacity, build predictive capacity models, identify bottlenecks, and\nprioritise and plan network expansion decisions. They're also using advanced\nanalytics to predict network capacity, mitigate business disruption and 'keep\nthe lights on'.\n\nCompanies like Cloudera are supporting telco customers to reduce degradation\nrisks through data analysis and ensuring current platforms are stable and\noperating. We're also seeing growing demand for billing dynamic capacity\nmodels which predict potential network failure based on real-time components.\n\nIn Europe, one telecommunications provider is leveraging analysis of its CRM\nto GPS data to help manage health and safety protocols in addition to\nimproving customer service during outage callouts. This includes identifying\nwhich customers have issues that require in person visits and the most\nefficient way to service them in person. They're also using their data to best\nprotect the wellbeing of staff and make informed business decisions to best\nsupport their customers. They call it 'COVID-19 Geofence'.\n\nLocally, telco providers are leveraging customer experience analytics to build\na 360-degree view of their customer journey across all channels and lines of\nbusiness. From this, they're building prediction models to identify a customer\nbase for personalised offers, even during this uncertain time.\n\nWell before this current global business disruption set in, telcos were some\nof the largest aggregators of data on the planet with access to an\nunprecedented number of data sources including customer profiles, customer\nusage patterns, apps downloaded and sensor data. And that volume is continuing\nto grow. Telcos need to ask themselves how they can leverage this treasure\ntrove of information and turn it into something meaningful for our post\nCOVID-19 world. Ultimately, it comes down to customer retention and growth,\nthey're the drivers.\n\nWith cutting-edge analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,\ntelcos can analyse large amounts of real-time data to drive significant\nbusiness impacts.\n\nThe main ways forward-thinking telecommunications operators are using data and\nanalytics include:\n\n1.    Customer Experience Analytics: leveraging deeper customer analytics to build a 360-degree view of the customer journey across all channels and lines of business has never been more relevant. From this, Telcos can build prediction models to identify and anticipate personalised offers and recommendations.\n\n2.    Network Optimisation: advanced analytics and machine learning are increasingly mission critical to monitor and manage network capacity, build predictive capacity models, identify bottlenecks, and prioritise and plan network expansion decisions. Using advanced analytics, Telcos can also predict network capacity.   \n\n3.    Operational Analytics: For providers seeking to ensure peak operational performance, key day-to-day operational data offers insights for revenue assurance, fraud, cybersecurity, financial forecasting, and equipment maintenance.\n\n4.    IoT and Digital Services: CSPs can offer more than a connectivity point of the Internet of Things (IoT), it also provides analytics and verticalised solutions for specific industry domains.\n\n5.    Connected Ecosystems: CSPs can effectively perform their role as a crucial enabler of interconnected technologies - such as smart cars, homes and cities.\n\nWith the IoT ecosystem expected to reach 25 billion connected devices by 2025,\nit presents a unique area of opportunity for Australian and New Zealand telco\noperators to diversify their offerings and embrace new transformational\nbusiness opportunities.  \n\nA sophisticated and thoughtful use of data will prove a critical business\ndifferentiator in this new environment. Likewise, the opportunities for growth\nand transformation as we look towards the post-COVID recovery phase are\nextensive.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n[ __Trustworthy and reliable: why making data privacy

For the duration of this pandemic and far\n> beyond, WellSky is dedicated to removing barriers to care and delivering the\n> right solutions when, where, and how our clients need them.\u201d\n\nEach of these efforts is part of WellSky\u2019s ongoing commitment to serving care\nproviders who are on the front lines of this formidable public health crisis.\nClients who are interested in learning more about these initiatives should\nemail WellSky at\n[covid19response@wellsky.com](mailto:covid19response@wellsky.com).\n\n  * **Virtual visit technology:** Given the well-documented shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), WellSky has partnered with Synzi to offer a free trial with access to a range of powerful virtual care capabilities. Providers can leverage cutting-edge video visit technology that empowers real-time visits between clinical staff and patients or case managers and their clients without the risk of contact with COVID-19 or other infections. Using secure messaging and remote symptom screening tools, patients can easily share their symptom status with their healthcare provider **** and provide regular updates on symptom progression or changes. Case managers can also use Synzi\u2019s tools to check in on clients at a high risk of isolation or to conduct remote assessments. As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, WellSky\u2019s partnership with Synzi will ensure post-acute and community providers are able to continue delivering safe, uninterrupted patient care.   \n  \n\n  * **On-demand patient record retrieval services:** As health systems refer more patients to post-acute and community care settings, WellSky is working with interoperability leader Kno2 to help organizations leverage technology for faster, easier information sharing \u2014 rather than using time-consuming methods like phone calls and faxes. Through Kno2\u2019s data exchange technology, care providers can search for historical patient records from participating hospitals, health systems, and clinics \u2014 saving valuable time and energy that could otherwise be devoted to patient care. This is available to WellSky\u2019s post-acute and community clients at no charge during current state and national emergency declarations.

The state was\namong three Rust Belt states, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that\nTrump carried in 2016 and that Democrats see as vital to winning back the\nWhite House this year.  \n  \nThe victory on Tuesday could allow Biden to claim a mandate from voters in the\nWolverine State and may bolster his campaign throughout the Midwest, including\nin Ohio, which holds its primary next week.  \n  \nIt\u2019s also likely to raise questions about Sanders\u2019s future in the primary\nrace. Biden is expected to widen his delegate lead on Tuesday and appears\npoised to continue his winning streak in the coming weeks.\n\nIn Florida, which holds its primary next Tuesday, recent polls show Biden\nleading Sanders by double digits. And in Arizona, another state that holds its\nprimary next week, Biden was holding a 28-point advantage over Sanders,\naccording to a survey released on Monday by the Phoenix-based firm OH\nPredictive Insights.  \n  \nThe last 10 days also represent a stark turnaround for Sanders, who emerged as\nthe primary race\u2019s early front-runner after top finishes in Iowa, New\nHampshire and Nevada, where the first three nominating contests were held.  \n  \nSouth Carolina, however, posed an insurmountable challenge for the Vermont\nsenator, as black voters and moderates came out in force for Biden in the\nprimary.\n\nThose same struggles manifested once again last week as Biden captured wins in\nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Alabama and seven other Super Tuesday states.\n\nBlack voters, often seen as the backbone of the Democratic Party, also helped\ndeliver Biden a big victory in Mississippi on Tuesday.\n\n _Updated: March 13 at 1:28 a.m._\n\nTags [Michael Bloomberg](/person/michael-bloomberg \"Michael Bloomberg\")\n[Hillary Clinton](/person/hillary-clinton \"Hillary Clinton\") [Bernie\nSanders](/person/bernie-sanders \"Bernie Sanders\") [Pete\nButtigieg](/person/pete-buttigieg \"Pete Buttigieg\") [Amy\nKlobuchar](/person/amy-klobuchar \"Amy Klobuchar\") [Donald\nTrump](/person/donald-trump \"Donald Trump\") [Joe Biden](/person/joe-biden \"Joe\nBiden\")\n\n[\n](mailto:?subject=TheHill.com%3A%20Biden%20takes%20command%20of%20Democratic%20race&body=From%20TheHill.com%3A%20%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttps%3A//thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486947-biden-\ntakes-command-of-democratic-race)\n\n[View the discussion\nthread.](http://thehill-v4.disqus.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F486947-biden-\ntakes-command-of-democratic-race)\n\n## Most Popular\n\n## Video\n\n[![](https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/stittkevin_110618.jpg?itok=OLEvS8Xa)](/hilltv/rising/491385-oklahoma-\nnonprofit-organizer-mayors-forced-to-step-up-in-states-with-less)\n\n[Oklahoma nonprofit organizer: Mayors forced to step up in states with less\nstringent social-distancing orders](/hilltv/rising/491385-oklahoma-nonprofit-\norganizer-mayors-forced-to-step-up-in-states-with-less)\n\nRising\n\n[![](https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/ca_washing_hands_corona_istock.jpg?itok=eHdE26PP)](/changing-\namerica/well-being/prevention-cures/487373-how-to-wash-your-hands-to-avoid-\ncoronavirus)\n\n[How to wash your hands to prevent coronavirus \u2014 because you're probably doing\nit wrong](/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/487373-how-to-wash-\nyour-hands-to-avoid-coronavirus)\n\nChanging America\n\n[![](https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/coronavirus_death_nyc_033120upi_lead.jpg?itok=FFPh93cu)](/hilltv/rising/491382-5000-firefighters-\nunder-quarantine-nationally-says-union-official)\n\n[Union official: 5,000 firefighters under quarantine\nnationally](/hilltv/rising/491382-5000-firefighters-under-quarantine-\nnationally-says-union-official)\n\nRising\n\n## More From The Web\n\nDon't miss a brief.

 \n**MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- **Two University of Minnesota research centers have\nlaunched the first website to better understand state-by-state hospitalization\ndata due to COVID-19.\n\nAs thousands of COVID-19 patients seek hospital care across the United States,\nthe site captures and tracks daily data on the number of COVID-19\nhospitalizations -- as reported by states' Departments of Health -- along with\neach states' hospital bed and intensive care unit capacity.\n\n[![](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/15909630/2020/04/u-of-m-hospitalization-\nproject.png?w=300)](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/mili-misrc-covid19-tracking-\nproject)\n\n(credit: University of Minnesota)\n\nThe COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project currently reports data from 37\nstates and can be found on their [website.\n](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/mili-misrc-covid19-tracking-project)The unique\nfeature of the site is users' ability to visualize and compare hospitalization\nactivity between states.\n\n\"Whereas each state collects its own data, we wanted to make it easy to share\nand analyze data across states,\" said Pinar Karaca-Mandic, associate professor\nat the Carlson School of Management and academic director of the Medical\nIndustry Leadership Institute. \"This wasn't possible until we launched this\nproject, and this is the first time that a comprehensive national view of the\ndata is available.\"\n\nThe hospital utilization data is adjusted for each state's population to allow\nfor valid comparison. \"The data can be used by public health officials for\npredictive analytics and hospital capacity planning to guide their decision-\nmaking,\" said Soumya Sen, associate professor at the Carlson School of\nManagement and research director of the Management Information Systems\nResearch Center.\n\nAs the U.S. anticipates a surging demand for hospital beds, ICU capacity and\nventilators, it's critical to have credible, real-time information at this\ntime, according to the U of M researchers. The project began seeking data on\nMarch 26, and in less than two weeks it already offers new and valuable\ninsights.\n\nThere are two categories in which users can see hospitalizations on the site:\ncumulatively, meaning total number of people admitted to the hospital since\nthe state began tracking for COVID-19 patients, and currently, meaning the\ntotal number of COVID-19 patients currently in hospitals in a state.\n\nAs of April 3, the project has found in the 23 states reporting cumulative\nhospitalizations, the average hospitalization rate is 7.76 admissions per\n100,000 adults, and 5.81 admissions per 100,000 people. Also, in the 13 states\nreporting current hospitalizations, the average hospitalization rate is 11.49\nadmissions per 100,000 adults.\n\n\"More analyses and insights would be possible with consistent data collection\nand reporting across all 50 states,\" said Karaca-Mandic. \"Therefore, we urge\nall states' Departments of Health to begin and/or continue providing\nconsistent standardized public reporting on four key metrics: cumulative\nCOVID-19 hospitalizations, cumulative COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU,\ncurrent COVID-19 patients hospitalized and current COVID-19 patients in the\nICU.\"\n\nAs of April 5, 13 states and the District of Columbia are not providing\nhospitalization data. These include: Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,\nMichigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Texas, Washington\nand West Virginia.\n\nComments\n\nYou must [log in](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fminnesota.cbslocal.com%2F2020%2F04%2F07%2Funiversity-\nof-minnesota-researchers-launch-u-s-covid-19-hospitalization-tracking-\nproject%2F%23respond) to post a comment.\n\n### Follow Us\n\n[**facebook_url**](http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota \"facebook_url\")[\n**twitter_url**](http://twitter.com/wcco \"twitter_url\")[\n**youtube_url**](http://youtube.com/wcco \"youtube_url\")[\n**instagram_url**](http://instagram.com/wcco \"instagram_url\")[\n**reddit_url**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cbsminnesota \"reddit_url\")[\n**linkedin_url**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wcco-tv/ \"linkedin_url\")\n\n### Our | Newsletter\n\n### Most  Viewed\n\n  * [ ![Coronavirus Updates: The Latest COVID-19 Headlines From April 7, 2020](https://i2.wp.com/minnesota.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909630/2020/04/1920x1080_COVID-19_HEADLINES.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1) ](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/04/07/coronavirus-updates-the-latest-covid-19-headlines-from-april-7-2020/ \"Coronavirus Updates: The Latest COVID-19 Headlines From April 7, 2020\")\n\n[Coronavirus Updates: The Latest COVID-19 Headlines From April 7,\n2020](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/04/07/coronavirus-updates-the-\nlatest-covid-19-headlines-from-april-7-2020/ \"Coronavirus Updates: The Latest\nCOVID-19 Headlines From April 7, 2020\")\n\n  * [ ![Coronavirus In Minnesota: 4 More Deaths Reported As Number Of COVID-19 Cases Breaches 1,000](https://i1.wp.com/minnesota.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909630/2020/04/GettyImages-1206290366.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1) ](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/04/07/coronavirus-in-minnesota-4-more-deaths-reported-as-number-of-covid-19-cases-breaches-1000/ \"Coronavirus In Minnesota: 4 More Deaths Reported As Number Of COVID-19 Cases Breaches 1,000\")\n\n[Coronavirus In Minnesota: 4 More Deaths Reported As Number Of COVID-19 Cases\nBreaches 1,000](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/04/07/coronavirus-in-\nminnesota-4-more-deaths-reported-as-number-of-covid-19-cases-breaches-1000/\n\"Coronavirus In Minnesota: 4 More Deaths Reported As Number Of COVID-19 Cases\nBreaches 1,000\")\n\n  * [ !['I Won't Forgive Glen...

Opinion poll found.\n\nWith six confirmed cases in Arizona, most voters expressed little concern\nabout a potential pandemic.\n\n\u201cDespite a barrage of news about sickened cruise ship passengers and\nquarantines, Arizonans appear less concerned about an outbreak here,\u201d said\nMike Noble, Chief of Research and Managing Partner of Phoenix-based public\nopinion and market research company OH Predictive Insights. \u201cThe fear gripping\nthe stock market and other countries hasn\u2019t caught on here.\u201d\n\nThe poll found 44 percent of likely voters in the state are either \u201cExtremely\u201d\nor \u201cModerately\u201d concerned about the spread of the coronavirus in the United\nStates, while just 35 percent said the same about the illness spreading in\nArizona -- one of the first states to have a confirmed case of the disease in\nthe United States.\n\nThe Arizona Statewide survey was conducted on March 3 and March 4, 2020, with\na sample of 600 respondents identified as likely voters. The medium utilized\nwas a blended phone survey with a Margin of Error of +/-4%.\n\nPresident Trump is earning low marks from Arizona voters regarding his\nhandling of the epidemic. Only 46 percent of Arizona voters approve of his\nactions regarding the coronavirus, while 54 percent disapprove. Among voters\nwho have an opinion of the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, approval\nwas split largely along party lines. 86 percent of Republicans approve of\nTrump\u2019s handling of the situation, 89 percent of Democrats disapprove, and\nIndependents split 35 percent approve, 65 percent disapprove.\n\n![Corona Virus\nHandling](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nThough most Arizonans disapprove of the actions that the president has taken\nto combat the coronavirus, there is broad approval among voters regarding how\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is handling the\nsituation.\n\nOH Predictive Insights\n\nThough most Arizonans disapprove of the actions that the president has taken\nto combat the coronavirus, there is broad approval among voters regarding how\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is handling the\nsituation. Three-quarters of Arizona likely voters approve of the measures the\nCDC has taken against the coronavirus, compared to only 14 percent of people\nwho disapprove. There is consensus among voters across the political spectrum\nthat the CDC is doing a good job, as well. 90 percent of Republicans, 82\npercent of Independents, and 80 percent of Democrats who had an opinion on the\nmatters approve of the CDC\u2019s actions.\n\n####\n\nMethodology: This blended phone poll was conducted via cell and landline. The\nsurvey was completed by OH Predictive Insights between March 3rd, 2020 and\nMarch 4th, 2020, from an Arizona likely 2020 General Election voter sample.\nThe sample demographics accurately reflected party affiliation, gender,\nregion, and age. The sample size was 600 completed surveys, with a MoE of \u00b1\n4.0%. Numbers may not total 100%, due to rounding.\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajnews.com%2Flifestyle%2Fhealth_wellness%2Fcoronavirus-fears-not-yet-gripping-arizona-voters%2Farticle_49c3846e-630b-11ea-bf32-a765d500b3d7.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Coronavirus%20Fears%20Not%20Yet%20Gripping%20Arizona%20Voters&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajnews.com%2Flifestyle%2Fhealth_wellness%2Fcoronavirus-fears-not-yet-gripping-arizona-voters%2Farticle_49c3846e-630b-11ea-bf32-a765d500b3d7.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Tweet\")\n  * [ __ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://www.ajnews.com/lifestyle/health_wellness/coronavirus-fears-not-yet-gripping-arizona-voters/article_49c3846e-630b-11ea-bf32-a765d500b3d7.html \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ __ SMS ](sms:?body=Check%20out%20this%20link:%20www.ajnews.com/tncms/asset/editorial/49c3846e-630b-11ea-bf32-a765d500b3d7 \"SMS\")\n  * [ __ Email ](mailto:?subject=%5BThe%20Apache%20Junction%20%26%20Gold%20Canyon%20News%5D%20Coronavirus%20Fears%20Not%20Yet%20Gripping%20Arizona%20Voters&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajnews.com%2Flifestyle%2Fhealth_wellness%2Fcoronavirus-fears-not-yet-gripping-arizona-voters%2Farticle_49c3846e-630b-11ea-bf32-a765d500b3d7.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * [Corona Virus](/search/?k=%22corona%20virus%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Survey](/search/?k=%22survey%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Opinion Poll](/search/?k=%22opinion%20poll%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Trump](/search/?k=%22trump%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Cdc](/search/?k=%22cdc%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Centers For Disease Control](/search/?k=%22centers%20for%20disease%20control%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n\n#### Locations\n\n  * [Arizona](/search/?g=arizona)\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Post a comment as Guest\n\nEmoticons\n\n  * [smile]\n  * [beam]\n  * [wink]\n  * [sad]\n  * [cool]\n  * [innocent]\n  * [rolleyes]\n  * [whistling]\n  * [lol]\n  * [huh]\n  * [tongue]\n  * [love]\n  * [sleeping]\n  * [yawn]\n  * [unsure]\n  * [angry]\n  * [blink]\n  * [crying]\n  * [ohmy]\n  * [scared]\n  * [sleep]\n  * [sneaky]\n  * [tongue_smile]\n  * [thumbdown]\n  * [thumbup]\n  * [censored]\n  * [happybirthday]\n  * [ban]\n  * [spam]\n  * [offtopic]\n  * [batman]\n  * [ninja]\n  * [pirate]\n  * [alien]\n\nComment Text\n\nCancel\n\nPost comment\n\n\u00d7\n\nYour comment has been submitted.\n\n__\n\n![]()\n\n**Guest**\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Report\n\nCancel\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\u00d7\n\nReported\n\n\u00d7\n\nThere was a problem reporting this.\n\n\u00d7\n\n####  Watch this discussion.

This requires spending\nless time on traditional - and often manual - reporting, planning, and closing\nprocesses, and much more time on deep analysis to distill, uncover, and share\nstrategic insights that help drive key business decisions in a much more\ntimely manner.\n\nUnderpinning this new remit is the need for real-time data. However, financial\ndata is growing in both volume and complexity, and is increasingly spread\nacross a range of point solutions, where it isn't connected and therefore\nloses invaluable business context.\n\nIt is this data challenge - and the rise of business intelligence (BI)\nsoftware across other enterprise departments - that has created a real\nheadache for finance teams.\n\n**The Rise of Business Intelligence**\n\nBI tools have become an enterprise software staple, and it's easy to see why:\nThe ability to explore, visualize, and share business data has made BI\nsolutions a bedrock upon which faster, better decisions can be made.\n\nIn fact, market [research](https://www.openpr.com/news/1918493/global-\nbusiness-intelligence-market-business-and-investment) expects the global BI\nmarket to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 10%, more than\ndoubling from $20 billion in 2018 to $43 billion in 2026. In large part, this\ngrowth can be attributed to enterprises increasingly moving more applications\nand data to cloud services, as well as their increasing demand for data-driven\nanalysis and business decisions.\n\nAs organizations move to the cloud, BI software provides a powerful and\nintuitive graphical analysis tool that serves sales, marketing, operations,\nand most other departments well.\n\nHowever, there is an exception: financial reporting.\n\nSimply put, the reporting needs of finance teams are highly specialized and\noften intertwined with the complex and customized data structures of ERP\nsystems that have reporting requirements well beyond what BI tools can deliver\ntoday.\n\nUnfortunately for many finance teams, they learn this too late: usually in the\naftermath of a BI implementation, since the selection of the reporting tools\nand technologies are often out of their direct control and reside with the IT\nteam.  \n\nAt this point, finance begins the arduous process of trying to close this \"BI\ngap.\" Typically the starting point is the new BI tool, but eventually finance\nteams revert to dumping static data from their ERP system into Excel for\nmanual manipulation out of sheer frustration.\n\n**Financial Intelligence is Now a Priority**\n\nAs CFOs and finance teams are increasingly asked by boards and executive teams\nto provide more timely data and analysis to power strategic decisions, there\nis a growing understanding of the need to increase financial intelligence\nthrough access to real-time data and the ability to aggregate, analyze, model,\nreport, forecast, plan, and close based on it.\n\nIn this approach, financial intelligence isn't software; it's how best-in-\nclass finance teams operate based on data-driven, higher-order thinking that\nis elevated out of the overwhelming number of data sources across an\nenterprise. More specifically it means finance teams are:\n\n  * Connected with immediate, real-time access to data instead of the time lag introduced by traditional \"Extract-Transform-Load-like\" activities\n  * Proactive with real-time and predictive insights over basic historical reporting\n  * Empowered with insights that create and enable value and provide transparency to aid compliance, rather than just reporting on business performance\n\nAnd CFOs are clearly feeling the pain. In its [2020 State of the\nCFO](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/assets/pdf/wp-brainyard-state-of-the-cfo-\nrole-in-2019.pdf) report, NetSuite surveyed more than 160 CFOs across 23\ndifferent industries and noted some important trends around data and\nreporting. When asked to name their biggest challenges as CFO, 29% said \"lack\nof access to accurate real-time information,\" while 25% said it was \"producing\ntimely reports,\" the third and sixth biggest challenges respectively.\n\nWhen asked in the same survey about their top five priorities over the next\ntwo years, the CFOs said:\n\n  * 55% - Better and faster reporting\n  * 50% - Revenue growth\n  * 41% - Increased data visibility\n  * 39% - Implementing new financial software\n  * 20% - Mergers & acquisitions\n\nBased on their stated challenges and priorities, CFOs and their teams are\nclearly caught in this gap. They're still looking to take more direct control\nover their reporting and data visibility to increase financial intelligence.\n\n**The Unique Reporting Needs of Finance**\n\nTo understand the challenge caused by the \"BI gap\" and how to avoid it, let's\nelaborate on why the reporting needs of finance are so different than other\ndepartments. Here are just a few common scenarios for these users:\n\n  * When trying to reconcile accounts or identify variances, finance must be able to drill into the data at a granular level to examine balance sheets, general ledgers, and subledgers. In addition, when they post an adjustment, they need to see it reflected immediately in their reports.\n  * They need to run comparative reports across different time periods, over budgets and actuals, and must be able to analyze and investigate variances.\n  * They need to conduct complex searches on multiple entities. For example, they need to identify discounts associated with paying accounts on time, and conversely, where it makes sense to focus collections efforts for account receivables.\n\nThis is just a small sampling in a vast range of financial use cases. But they\nreveal why a high degree of flexibility--as well as formatting control--over\nreporting is needed.\n\n**Finance 's \"Holy Grail\": Real-Time Data**\n\nWhile modern BI solutions have certainly moved the needle with self-service\nfeatures that allow users to create their own reports, even these tools are\nunable to handle the \"messy structure\" of financial data, especially in ERP\nsystems.\n\nSo, what's next? Typically the initial suggestion is for IT teams to try\nimporting data into a data warehouse with a structure that is optimized for\nfinancial reporting. However, this breaks the link to underlying transactions,\nlosing one of the most critical aspects of financial reporting: access to\nreal-time data.\n\nThis is crucial since it now means there is a time lag between data being\nentered into the ERP system and that same data flowing into the data warehouse\nand reports. At period end, when finance relies on the most current data to\nhandle reconciliations and consolidations and produce financial statements,\ndelays like this are unacceptable.\n\nBI tools also struggle to handle changes to financial reporting structures.\nEven the slightest change to a chart of accounts will require reworking--often\nby IT--which again creates a major time, resource, and data relevance drain.\n\nSo, we're back to square one. This is where finance teams take things into\ntheir own hands and start manually dumping data from their ERP system into\nExcel. However, there are lots of pitfalls to this approach, too.\n\nFirst, there's the lengthy data download process. Second, all of this data\nmust be manually manipulated into the required reporting structures, which has\nto be started from scratch each time. This is onerous and time-consuming, but\neven more concerning, it introduces the risk of mis-keying errors.\n\nThis leads to yet another problem: Because the data has been manually\nmanipulated, errors will be extremely difficult (sometimes impossible) to\ntrack and will require a complete redo of the report.\n\nThe issue looming over this entire approach is that it relies on static data,\nwhich means by the time finance teams create the reports in their desired\nformats, executives and other stakeholders are viewing numbers that are days,\nif not weeks, out of date.\n\n**Four Questions to Help You Close the \"BI Gap\"**\n\nCompanies that have mastered financial reporting have learned that financial\nintelligence is not the same as business intelligence. One of the keys to\nunlocking greater financial intelligence is having the right tools available\nto support finance's unique reporting needs.\n\nAsking these four questions when choosing BI tools and third-party reporting\nsolutions--or when working with IT teams to select them--can go a long way\ntoward helping CFOs close the \"BI gap\" or avoid it altogether:\n\n  1. _Do you have access to real-time data?_\n\nAs discussed, this is a \"holy grail\" in financial reporting, which is why it's\ncritical that any third-party reporting solution provides a direct connection\nto the ERP system that enables users to work with live data. Without it,\nfinance is not only working with a static, error-prone process, they are\nreporting on stale data instead of delivering the most up-to-date financial\ninformation and analysis for decision-making.\n\n  2. _Is reporting automated_?\n\nReporting tools optimized for finance should simplify complex reporting tasks\nand allow a wide range of reports to be generated instantly, including\nfinancial statements, period-on-period analysis, and variance analysis. This\nfrees finance teams from a dependence on developers and IT and lets them\noperate at the speed business demands.\n\n  3. _Can you combine data from multiple sources?_\n\nAccess to live data and automated reporting from the ERP system is crucial,\nbut these advantages quickly lose their luster if you can't integrate data\nfrom other business-critical systems (such as other ERPs, CRM, HRM, etc.).\nCobbling together data and reports from more than one source in Excel only\ncompounds the problem that already exists with manual reporting. Ensuring a\nreporting tool has the ability to combine real-time information and automate\nreporting from multiple, disparate sources should be a priority.\n\n  4. _Can you run complex reports yourself?_\n\nSelf-service reporting isn't new, but as discussed, native capabilities aren't\nan option for the intricate needs of finance. Instead, financial reporting\ntools should have a deep understanding of the ERP system and its data\nstructures so the finance team can create its own custom reports and ad hoc\ninquiries instantly, without detailed ERP schema knowledge or a reliance on\nIT.\n\nWhile BI platforms are a strategic business asset, the reality is that finance\nteams have distinct reporting needs that are not met by most native BI\ncapabilities. As more CFOs aim to make the leap from the legacy role of\nbookkeeper to strategic analyst and business partner to the CEO and other\nstakeholders, empowering them to connect to and make sense of their data, add\ncontext, and build confidence in their numbers to deliver more proactive,\nefficient, and timely insights are all key to driving greater financial\nintelligence across organizations.\n\n_**Wes Gillette is vice president of products for insightsoftware.**_\n\n### More On Technology\n\n#### [How to Choose the Right AP Automation Solution: A 2020 Buyer\u2019s\nGuide](/FEI-Daily/April-2020/How-to-Choose-the-Right-AP-Automation-\nSolution-A.aspx)\n\nSponsored by Yooz | 04/6/2020\n\n#### [Magecart Primer: 5 Things Every CFO Should Know](/FEI-\nDaily/March-2020/Magecart-Primer-5-Things-Every-CFO-Should-Know.aspx)\n\nOphir Ashkenazi | 03/9/2020\n\n#### [Data Governance: The New Frontier for the Board](/FEI-\nDaily/February-2020/Data-Governance-The-New-Frontier-for-the-Board.aspx)\n\n[Olivia Berkman](https://www.financialexecutives.org/FEI-\nDaily/Author.aspx?authorid=136) | 02/13/2020\n\n### Join Today\n\nAccess networking, education, and career development opportunities.\n\n[Become a Member](https://www.financialexecutives.org/Become-a-Member.aspx)\n\n### Email Newsletter\n\nGet industry trends and policy breakdowns delivered each day.\n\n[Sign Up](http://feinsight.us7.list-\nmanage.com/subscribe?u=d51979bd0cc426a110a933f75&id=2349ffa285)\n\n### About FEI Daily\n\nYour go-to source for financial news and insightful analysis.\n\n[Learn More](/FEI-Daily/About-Us.aspx)\n\n[ __](/)\n\nFinancial Executives International\n\nAdvancing success through information, community and advocacy since 1931.\n\nFinancial Executives International connects senior-level financial executives\nby defining the profession, exchanging ideas about best practices, educating\nmembers and others and working with the government to improve the general\neconomy.\n\n![](https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=40054&fmt=gif)\n\n  * [Network](/Network.aspx)\n  * [Events](/Events.aspx)\n  * [Research](/Research.aspx)\n  * [Influence](/Influence.aspx)\n  * [Learn](/Learn.aspx)\n  * [Profession](/Profession.aspx)\n  * [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://www.financialexecutives.org/Topics/CrisisManagement.aspx)\n\n  * [About FEI](https://www.financialexecutives.org/About-FEI.aspx)\n  * [Member Directory](http://connect.financialexecutives.org/network)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.financialexecutives.org/About-FEI/Contact-Us.aspx)\n  * []()\n  * [CPE Center](https://www.financialexecutives.org/CPE-Center.aspx)\n  * [FEI Daily](https://www.financialexecutives.org/FEI-Daily.aspx)\n  * [FEIconnect](https://connect.financialexecutives.org/)\n  * [Topics](https://www.financialexecutives.org/Topics.aspx)\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:webmaster@financialexecutives.org?Subject=Website%20Feedback)\n\n(C) 2020 Financial Executives International\n\n1250 Headquarters Plaza | West Tower, 7th Floor  \nMorristown, NJ 07960\n\nPhone: 973.765.1000 | Fax: 973.765.1018\n\n[Follow on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-executives-\ninternational) | [Like on\nFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/FinancialExecutivesInternational/)  \n[Follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/feinews) | [Follow on\nInstagram](https://www.instagram.com/financialexecs.intl/)\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for:\n\n__\n\n## Sponsor\n\nVisit Website\n\n__\n\n## Sign In\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nKeep me signed in [Forgot Login](../../Account/Login-Help.aspx)  \n[Create account](../../Account/Create-\nAccount.aspx?ReturnURL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.financialexecutives.org%2fFEI-\nDaily%2fMarch-2020%2fERP-Financial-Reporting-Mind-the-BI-\nGap%e2%80%9d.aspx%3faliaspath=/FEI-Daily/March-2020/ERP-Financial-Reporting-\nMind-the-BI-Gap\u201d)  \n  \n---  \n  \n__\n\n"}, {"item": "LimeLight CRM Rebrands as sticky.io, Extends Ecommerce Order Management and Recurring Billing Solution to Address Growing Industry Demand -

The change is effective immediately, and will be reflected in the\ncompany\u2019s identity, product, services and mission.\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [Ricoh Spins out Vecnos to Focus on Consumer\n360-Degree Camera Segment](https://martechseries.com/video/ricoh-spins-vecnos-\nfocus-consumer-360-degree-camera-segment/)\n\n\u201cOver the past three years, we have invested significantly in building a\nunique and industry-leading ecommerce platform that enables merchants and\npartners to support the growing online consumer demand. With ease of\ndeployment and use, flexibility in billing and sophisticated real-time data\nand analytics, we allow our clients to optimize revenues and profitability,\u201d\nsaid Brian Bogosian, president and CEO of sticky.io. \u201cSupporting our clients\u2019\nsuccess has allowed us to grow revenue 5x year-over-year, over the last 4\nyears, while remaining profitable from day one. We will continue to innovate\nand lead the market to support direct-to-consumer brands \u2014 both incumbent\nbrands as well as disruptive digitally native vertical brands \u2014 that require a\nbroad and sophisticated platform to execute their online commerce aspirations\nand business goals.\u201d\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [EnergyBot Raises Series B\nFunding](https://martechseries.com/technology/energybot-raises-series-b-\nfunding/)\n\nsticky.io offers unique value that helps brands take more control and improve\ncustomer experiences so they can focus their time and resources on product\ninnovation and accelerating business outcomes. Replacing disparate back-end\ntechnical tools with a seamless, enterprise-grade commerce technology helps\nmerchants get up and running in weeks versus months. These differentiators set\nsticky.io apart:\n\n  * Single ecommerce order management platform with broad native capabilities replaces the need for costly and cumbersome multiple plugin products\n  * Storefront-agnostic APIs enable integration with sticky.io for customer reporting and analytics, order management, subscription management and flexible billing: sticky.io seamlessly integrates with all the leading storefront and funnel front-end solutions\n  * Unified view of customer data spans system profiles, touchpoints and purchase history\n  * Robust analytics provide real-time and predictive insights into customer behavior and how to proactively influence and optimize future engagement\n  * Flexibility to sell both digital and physical goods, as well as subscription and straight sales through mixed-cart capabilities\n  * Enterprise-grade solution built for speed, scale, flexibility, reliability and security\n  * PCI Level 1, CCPA and GDPR compliant\n  * Developer-friendly toolkit facilitates rapid integration with third-party solutions\n\nAs direct-to-consumer brands shift to take a more relationship-centric\napproach, [sticky.io](http://sticky.io)

Data gathered by Learnbonds.com\nindicates that the companies have offered at least $1.4 billion towards\nmitigating the virus. Top on the list is California based [Google\n](https://martechseries.com//?s=Google)that has donated about $800 million\nthat will be used to support businesses, organizations and healthcare workers\nas part of its coronavirus response that also includes free\n[advertising](https://martechseries.com//?s=advertising) on its various\nplatforms. [Cisco](https://martechseries.com//?s=Cisco) has also pledged about\n$225 million towards the course. On the other hand, social networking giant\n[Facebook ](https://martechseries.com//?s=Facebook)has donated $120 million\nwhile the [Dell Foundation](http://www.msdf.org/) has pledged $100 million.\nStreaming service provider [Netflix](https://martechseries.com//?s=Netflix)\nhas set aside $115 million for the creative community as a coronavirus relief\nfund. Other notable donations to fight the COVID-19 pandemic have come from\n[Amazon ](https://martechseries.com//?s=Amazon)($32 million), [Samsung\n](https://martechseries.com//?s=Samsung)($29 million), [Apple\n](https://martechseries.com//?s=Apple)($15 million), [Microsoft\n](https://martechseries.com//?s=Microsoft)($1 Million) and [Twitter\n](https://martechseries.com//?s=Twitter)($1 million).\n\n### **The Need for Donations**\n\nThe pandemic has put a strain on the healthcare system and the economy and\nmost donations are focused on addressing these areas. Generally, the donations\nby the tech companies will go to causes like buying equipment, supporting the\nvulnerable, sensitization of the masses among others.\n\nSince the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic, most\ncompanies and philanthropists came on board and made donations towards\nfighting the crisis.\n\nBy press time, the Coronavirus cases stood at 1,349,956 with 74,822 deaths and\n286,887 recoveries. The United States is the most hit country with 367,650\ncases. Notably, the majority of tech companies that have donated towards\nfighting the pandemic are American based.\n\nThe pandemic has crippled the global economy, something evident with the\ncrushing stock market. It is not clear when the economy will be back to normal\nconsidering that it is still uncertain when the pandemic will end. However,\nthe travel and tourism industry is the most hit following the grounding of\nmany planes and countries being placed on lockdown as a measure to curb the\nspread of the virus.\n\nFor example, the EU banned travelers from outside the block for 30 days in a\nmove aimed to close its borders. In the US, the government banned travelers\nfrom European airports from entering the country. Additionally, most people\nseized from flying and airlines tried luring clients by cheap flights, a\nstrategy that did not work in the long term.\n\n_**Read more:**_[Big Data: The Role of Predictive Analytics in Sales Growth\n](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/sales-intelligence/the-role-of-\npredictive-analytics-in-sales-growth/)\n\n### **Travel and Tourism Industry Revenue to Slump by 40% in 2020**\n\nAn overview of the leading travel and tourism industries shows that in 2020\nand it is projected that China will be the biggest loser. According to the\nprojection, the industry will drop from $117.8 billion in 2019 to about $70.5\nbillion in 2020. China was the first country to be impacted by the virus and\nas a result, more airlines suspended flights to the country.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States travel and tourism sector will be the\nsecond most impacted by losing about $15.6 billion in revenue. Last year the\nUS revenue stood at $156.27 billion while 2020\u2019s projections stand at $140.64\nbillion. In Europe, Italy will lose about $4.8 billion in revenue. Last year,\nthe country\u2019s tourism sector revenue was $20.26 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, Germany will lose $3.18 billion, after recording a revenue\nof $31.82 billion. By projection, the four countries alone will lose $70.88\nbillion due to the pandemic in 2020.\n\nNotably, Italy and Germany are among the most hit countries hit with the\npandemic in Europe. Italy has at least 132,000 cases with about 16,500 deaths.\nOn the other hand, Germany has recorded at least 103,000 cases with about 1800\ndeaths.\n\nWhile other businesses are finding means of helping combat the pandemic, the\ntravel, and tourism industry will be searching for a way out into recovery\nonce the crisis is over.\n\nGenerally, there are fears that the spread of Coronavirus will fully cripple\neconomies and most jurisdictions have come up with measures to contain the\nsituation. In response, central banks in many countries have slashed interest\nrates while rolling out stimulus packages to aid citizens and small businesses\nin the course of the crisis.\n\n_**Read more:**_[Understanding Your Customers and Prospect During Uncertain\nTimes](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/understanding-\ncustomers-prospect-uncertain-times/)\n\n__[Cisco](https://martechseries.com/tag/cisco/)[coronavirus](https://martechseries.com/tag/coronavirus/)[Donation](https://martechseries.com/tag/donation/)[Facebook](https://martechseries.com/tag/facebook/)[google](https://martechseries.com/tag/google/)[healthcare\nsystem](https://martechseries.com/tag/healthcare-system/)[leading tech\ncompanies](https://martechseries.com/tag/leading-tech-\ncompanies/)[Netflix](https://martechseries.com/tag/netflix/)[Samsung](https://martechseries.com/tag/samsung/)[Travel\nand Tourism](https://martechseries.com/tag/travel-and-tourism/)\n\n[__**0**](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/10-tech-\ncompanies-donates-1-4bn-fight-coronavirus/#respond \"Leave a comment on: \u201c10\nTech Companies Donates Over $1.4bn to Fight Coronavirus\u201d\") __**88**\n\n__**Share**\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F10-tech-companies-donates-1-4bn-fight-\ncoronavirus%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/share?text=10+Tech+Companies+Donates+Over+%241.4bn+to+Fight+Coronavirus&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F10-tech-companies-donates-1-4bn-fight-\ncoronavirus%2F)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F10-tech-companies-donates-1-4bn-fight-\ncoronavirus%2F&title=10+Tech+Companies+Donates+Over+%241.4bn+to+Fight+Coronavirus)\n\n[ ](https://martechseries.com/author/justinas-baltrusaitris/ \"Browse Author\nArticles\")\n\n[Justinas Baltrusaitris](https://martechseries.com/author/justinas-\nbaltrusaitris/)\n\nJustin is an editor, writer, and a downhill fan.

posting\n7% gains on Monday. The positivity comes as Wall Street appears pleased with\nsigns that social distancing is working in the U.S. and elsewhere to help\nflatten the coronavirus\ncurve.%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cheap-stocks-\nunder-%2410-to-buy-as-market-climbs-on-coronavirus-optimism-2020-04-07)\n\nThe Dow, the S&P 500, and Nasdaq all jumped again Tuesday, after posting 7%\ngains on Monday. The positivity comes as Wall Street appears pleased with\nsigns that social distancing is working in the U.S. and elsewhere to help\nflatten the coronavirus curve.\n\nThe recent climb is part of a larger two week run that has seen the S&P 500\njump roughly 20% from its March 23 lows, with the Dow making a similar move.\nThis helps show that pulling out of the market completely during downturns and\nvolatility likely prevents you from grabbing some big bounces.\n\nThat said, volatility could remain because no one really knows when the\neconomy will start to return anywhere close to _normal_ even though health\nofficials and the White House have said that models suggest that the number of\ncoronavirus cases is likely to reach a peak sometime soon.\n\nNonetheless, investors interested in \u201ccheap stocks\u201d might want to be on the\nhunt now for stocks to buy, or at least add to their watchlists because the\nmarket is a forward-looking entity and the last two Weeks help demonstrate\nthat Wall Street is starting to look to better days.\n\nToday, we dive into three cheap stocks trading under $10 a share. We also\ntried to focus on stocks from more recession-resilient industries\u2026\n\n**Amcor plc[AMCR](/market-activity/stocks/amcr)**\n\nPrior Close: $8.22 USD\n\nAmcor completed its purchase of Bemis in June 2019 to create a massive global\npackaging powerhouse that services a variety of industries, from food and\nbeverage to pharmaceuticals and personal care. The company\u2019s offerings include\nflexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and more. Amcor has also\nstarted to focus on making what it calls \u201cincreasingly light-weighted,\nrecyclable and reusable\u201d products that are made \u201cusing a rising amount of\nrecycled content.\u201d\n\nAmcor\u2019s push toward greater sustainability could prove key amid growing\nbacklash to plastic and waste. Yet, plastic and paper packaging of all types\nremain vital around the globe and likely will for years to come. Looking\nahead, our Zacks estimates call for Amcor\u2019s fiscal 2020 revenue to jump over\n34% to reach $12.71 billion, driven by its Bemis deal. Meanwhile, its positive\nearnings revisions activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now,\nalongside its \u201cB\u201d grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.\n\nAmcor also grabs a \u201cB\u201d grade for Value, and it is trading at a discount\nagainst its industry, the S&P 500, and its own three-year median at 12.8X\nforward 12-month Zacks earnings estimates. Perhaps most importantly, AMCR\u2019s\ndividend yield rests at 5.63% right now, which crushes its industry\u2019s average\nof 3.25% and the S&P\u2019s 2.13%. Amcor shares have also soared over 40% since\nMarch 16 and they still have room to run before they reach their 52-week\nhighs.\n\n**Sandstorm Gold Ltd[SAND](/market-activity/stocks/sand)**\n\nPrior Close: $5.72 USD\n\nSandstorm is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold\nmining companies. The firm then receives the right to a percentage of the gold\nproduced for the lifetime of that mine. SAND posted record fiscal year revenue\nin February, with sales up over 22% to $89.4 million. This top-line expansion\nwas driven by record attributable gold equivalent ounces sold of 63,829\nounces, up from 57,646 ounces in 2018.\n\nSandstorm's fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump another 27%, with its\nadjusted earnings expected to climb 44%. SAND sports an \u201cA\u201d grade for Growth\nin our Style Scores system and its longer-term earnings revisions activity\nremains elevated to help it hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors should also\nnote that Sandstorm is part of our Mining \u2013 Gold industry that rests in the\ntop 8% of our more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nShares of Sandstorm have jumped along with the broader market over the last\ntwo weeks, up roughly 18%. Yet, SAND stock still has nearly 30% more room to\nrun before it touches its 52-week highs. Sandstorm did withdraw its 2020\nproduction guidance for the year in March due to possible coronavirus impacts.\nBut the Vancouver-based firm said that it \u201chas not received any direct\nnotification of closures at any partner mine sites.\u201d\n\n**Tesco PLC[TSCDY](/market-activity/stocks/tscdy)**\n\nPrior Close: $8.38 USD\n\nTesco is a UK multinational grocery powerhouse that seems ready to withstand\nthe coronavirus social distancing push that has hurt non-essential retailers.\nBritain's market-leading supermarket chain has announced that it will ramp up\nhiring to help deal with increased coronavirus-based demand, alongside Amazon\n[AMZN](/market-activity/stocks/amzn), Walmart [WMT](/market-\nactivity/stocks/wmt), and others. In March, Tesco said that it reached a deal\nworth more than $10 billion to sell its Asian businesses to Thai billionaire\nDhanin Chearavanont.\n\nThe company also [plans to return](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesco-m-\na-thailand/tesco-to-return-6-6-billion-to-shareholders-after-sale-of-thai-\nmalaysia-assets-idUSKBN20W0OO) roughly $6.6 billion to shareholders after\nagreeing to the massive deal. Shares of Tesco have jumped over 13% in the last\ntwo weeks and have climbed 18% in the last three years, which slightly\noutpaces its industry\u2019s average. Meanwhile, TSCDY\u2019s 2.38% dividend yield tops\nKroger\u2019s [KR](/market-activity/stocks/kr) 1.96% and the S&P 500\u2019s average.\n\nTSCDY is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) within an industry that sits in the\ntop 35% of our more than 250 Zacks industries. The stock also sports \u201cB\u201d\ngrades for both Growth and Momentum and an \u201cA\u201d for Value in our Style Scores\nsystem. Tesco\u2019s adjusted fiscal year earnings are projected to climb nearly\n22% on the back of roughly 13% stronger sales. Peeking further ahead, its\nbottom-line is expected to jump another 12% next year.\n\n**Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?**  \n  \nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment\nopportunities of legal marijuana.  \n  \nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast\nfrom an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors\nstand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where\nto look.  \n  \n **[See the pot trades we're\ntargeting>>](https://www.zacks.com/registration/ultimatetrader/welcome/eoffer/381b?adid=ZCOM_ZU_MarijuanaReport_B_STOCKSINTHENEWS_MARIJ2_040720&icid=EOAC-\nSTOCKSINTHENEWS-tx-ZU040720)**\n\n  \n[Click to get this free\nreport](http://www.zacks.com/registration/pfp/?ALERT=RPT_7BST_LP194&ADID=NASDAQ_CONTENT_ZER_ARTCAT_STOCKS_IN_THE_NEWS_305&cid=CS-\nNASDAQ-FT-stocks_in_the_news%7Cinvestment_ideas-859424)  \n  \n[Amazon.com, Inc.

These topics, and easy-to-read\npatient education resources, are updated continuously. In addition, the\nUpToDate editorial team has expanded free access to topics in Infectious\nDiseases, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, providing information related\nto diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and its complications.  \n  \nTo support clinicians with patients heading home after hospitalization for\nCOVID-19, discharge instructions and patient-facing information is now also\navailable for free. The downloadable PDF includes information about\nrecommended care at home, follow-up care, medications, what physical activity\nwill be limited and more.  \n  \nTo help epidemiologists and public health agencies turn the tide on the\ncoronavirus pandemic, Wolters Kluwer has developed a global interactive bubble\nmap that highlights areas of high clinical search intensity in UpToDate, which\nmay support clinicians in gaining helpful insight to anticipate regional\nincreases of reported COVID-19 cases.  \n  \nCross-disciplinary teams at Wolters Kluwer developed the interactive map by\nanalyzing how often specific questions related to COVID-19 are searched by\ndoctors, nurses and other clinicians globally. This leverages global search\nactivity in UpToDate, a trusted resource used by more than 1.9 million\nclinicians for clinical decision support in direct patient care.  \n  \nData scientists calculated and displayed what is called 'search intensity' and\nalso factored into this bubble map cases of COVID-19 reported by Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. In previous studies (looking at MERS and influenza),1,2 an\nincrease in search intensity correlated with documented outbreaks.  \n  \nThe map illustrates how search intensity increases over time in regions around\nthe world and where it is diminishing.  \n  \n'For almost 30 years, UpToDate has supported clinicians around the world and\npromoted the best patient care.' said Alaa Darwish, Country Manager Middle\nEast, Turkey and Africa - Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters Kluwer, Health.\n'We want to support healthcare providers across the region in any way we can\nin the fight against COVID-19.'  \n  \nView the live map now: https://covid19map.uptodate.com?utm_source=press-\nrelease&utm;_medium=website&utm;_campaign=interactive-map-pr  \n  \nRead more  \nWolters Kluwer will continue to make resources available for clinicians\nbattling COVID-19 around the world.
