Artificial intelligence\n(AI) may seem impersonal but it is speeding up the hiring process amid a\nmanpower crunch - and attempting to make subconscious biases a thing of the\npast.\n\nDespite recent setbacks with e-commerce giant Amazon ditching its AI\nrecruiting tool - [it turned out that it favoured men for technical\njobs](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/amazon-scraps-ai-\nrecruiting-tool-showing-bias-against-women) \\- more companies here have been\nworking to automate parts of their recruitment process.\n\nStart-up Impress.AI, which launched in January last year, has already worked\nwith 20 Singapore firms, including telco Singtel and DBS Bank, and government\nagencies to design virtual recruiters.\n\nDBS has been using a new virtual recruiter to hire employees since April. The\nsystem has screened about 1,000 candidates and helped hire almost 300 new\nemployees.\n\n\"There was a business need to hire 40 per cent more wealth planning managers\nthis year, and the previous hiring model would not have been able to\nefficiently support our growth plans,\" said DBS head of talent acquisition\nJames Loo.\n\nDBS will expand its use of the system to hire wealth planning managers and\nrelationship managers in markets such as Hong Kong and China. The tool will\nalso screen its 2019 batch of management associates - a process where 7,000 or\nso candidates vie for 20 positions.\n\n![The three-month AI for Industry \\(AI4I\\) course is on developing basic AI\nand data applications, while the three-hour AI for Everyone \\(AI4E\\) workshop\naims to help people appreciate the practical use of\nAI.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2018/08/30/ictablet300818.jpg?itok=fXKOzok5)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [12,000 to benefit over next three years from two new AI training\ninitiatives](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/12000-to-benefit-over-\nnext-three-years-from-two-new-ai-initiatives)\n\n  * ### 300\n\n  * Number of new employees DBS Bank has hired since it began using a new virtual recruiter to hire employees in April. The system has screened about 1,000 candidates.\n\nRecruiters spend up to 20 per cent of their time collecting information and\nresponding to e-mails before meeting shortlisted candidates, so DBS' new\nsystem saves staff up to three months worth of work in a year, said Mr Loo.\n\nSingtel uses its bot to assess if candidates have qualities like leadership.\n\nImpress.AI is not the only firm whose software is being used by firms here. In\nJanuary, tech firm AnyMind Group launched a machine-learning system that can\nanalyse resumes and jobseekers' social media accounts using semantic analysis\nand by processing natural language, to help match them with businesses looking\nto hire. About 30 Singapore clients have signed up to use the software, said\nMr Sho Kondo, head of AnyMind's AI-driven recruiting platform TalentMind. It\nhas about 180 subscribers worldwide.\n\nIn October last year, European software giant SAP launched an analyser - that\nscans job postings for language reflecting gender bias - which it plans to\nexpand to Singapore.\n\n  * ### How Impress.AI's chatbot system works\n\n  * \u2022 Once a candidate clicks \"apply now\", the chatbot pops up to give an overview of the position.\n\n\u2022 When applicants are ready, the bot then takes them through steps that\ntypically include an eligibility check, looking into issues like visa status\nand salary expectations, followed by a background-check section on degrees and\ncertificates.\n\n\u2022 It also has a customisable scenario-based section testing candidates'\ncompetencies. This can involve coding or personality tests.\n\n\u2022 At each point, candidates can ask the bot questions about the company or its\navailable jobs. They can also leave the application and come back to continue\nwhere they left off.\n\n\u2022 Besides presenting candidates' responses to the recruiter, the software also\nassesses answers, including open-ended text responses to situational judgment\nquestions, performance on coding and so on.\n\n**Seow Bei Yi**\n\n\"The system will scan the words used, give a masculine versus feminine score\nand suggest how recruiters can make their wording more gender-neutral,\" said\nMr Khor Chern Chuen, SAP's managing director for Singapore. He added that it\ncan also make salary recommendations based on historical data and potentially,\nexternal sources, so as to prevent recruiters' inherent biases from affecting\noffers made.\n\nWhile Amazon, which had been building programs since 2014 to review resumes\nand automate the search for talent, suffered a setback when its system failed\nto rate candidates in a gender-neutral way, Impress.AI co-founder Sudhanshu\nAhuja remains optimistic about using AI in recruitment.\n\nHis firm's software does not base recruitment decisions on a client's past\nhiring patterns, he said, adding: \"We have built a unique rating system that\nallows the recruiter to rate answers for a competency or question without\nseeing any biasing information about the candidate, such as gender and race.\"\n\nBut ManpowerGroup Singapore country manager Linda Teo warned that even as\ntechnology reduces time and costs in hiring and improves accuracy in\nidentifying candidates for a job, recruitment still needs a human touch.\n\nManpowerGroup has a tracking system that can sift through applications and\nbuild a database for future needs. Jobseekers may try to game the system by\npredicting keywords recruiters look for, such as \"search engine optimisation\"\nfor a marketing role, even if they have no related experience, said Ms Teo.\n\nBut she said \"employers have to use AI responsibly and use only information\nthat jobseekers have explicitly provided for their job applications, and not\ninformation from their personal social media accounts\".\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non December 12, 2018, with the headline 'Virtual recruiters keeping an AI out\nfor talent'.

a deluge of applications, some of the world\u2019s largest organisations are\nincreasingly turning to AI and chatbots to help in the recruitment process.\n\n[![Future of Work Week graphic.](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/fow-\nweek.png)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-of-work-week)\n\nWhile the technology used when applying for a job has changed dramatically in\nthe internet age, the interview process is still largely as familiar an\nexperience as it would be to someone a few decades ago.\n\nFor recruiters, this means sifting through reams of email print-outs and\ntrying to come up with the easiest way to get through thousands of\napplications. In addition to the strain this would put on any human having to\ndo such a task, there\u2019s also the issue of bias that too commonly crops up in\nthe hiring process.\n\nThis issue has led some to suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) and\nmachine learning can at least be the first port of call to make a recruiter\u2019s\nlife a bit easier. During a recent visit to Singapore, I caught up with one\nstart-up that has already caught the attention of multinational organisations\nwith the promise of \u201cmaking hiring fairer\u201d.\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore \u2013 but with offices in India and the US \u2013\n[Impress](https://impress.ai) is a start-up co-founded and led by Sudhanshu\nAhuja, which has developed a recruiter chatbot designed for the preliminary\nstages of the interview process.\n\nWhen an employer selects a list of competencies required for a job, the\nchatbot is published along with the job posting and can then respond to\napplicants. If a candidate meets all the criteria, then the recruiter can\nstart reaching out to them for the next round.\n\nSo far, the concept seems to have ticked some boxes for a number of\norganisations, with Impress\u2019s chatbot involved in hiring in its native\nSingapore with the banking giant DBS and Singtel, but also internationally\nwith Accenture and Panasonic.\n\nDBS has reported results for the JIM (Jobs Intelligence Maestro) chatbot,\nclaiming an 81pc reduction in candidate qualification time with 400 people\nrecruited annually using the tool. [Last\nSeptember](https://www.techinasia.com/raised-12m-built-chatbot-dbs-singtel-\nntuc-income-recruiters), Impress raised $1.2m and plans to raise more this\nyear.\n\nWorking with the Singapore government makes up half of the company\u2019s revenues,\naccording to Ahuja, but he is now using this as a basis for expansion into\nwork with the US government, or at least as part of preliminary discussions.\n\n## The bias problem\n\nBut regarding the technology, there is an obvious question that you might be\nwondering: could a biased AI chatbot unfairly eliminate a human candidate just\nas much \u2013 or more than \u2013 a human recruiter?\n\nBias in AI is [not a new\nconcept](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/biased-ai-identify-objects-\npoor-households), with many researchers pointing out various flaws in\nalgorithms when it comes to making important life decisions, or especially\nwhen related to [facial\nrecognition](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/amazon-rekognition-ai-\ncctv-civil-rights-groups).\n\n## Hiring Now\n\n  * [ ![Life at Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JLR_Logo_Lockup_Horiz_720mm_CMYK-3.jpg)\n\nReinvent what tomorrow looks like today\n\n](http://www.jaguarlandrovercareers.com/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Genomics Medicine Ireland](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Genomics_Medicine_Ireland_logo.png)\n\nImproving lives through genomics\n\n](https://genomicsmed.ie/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Workhuman](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/WH-Logo_charcoal-gold_RGB_1101px.png)\n\nMake work more human\n\n](https://www.workhuman.com/company/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Mastercard](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MC-330x255.jpg)\n\nJoin a culture that offers a world of possibilities\n\n](https://www.mastercard.ie/en-ie/about-mastercard/careers.html)\n\nBut Ahuja said that he and the rest of the Impress team developed the\ntechnology fully aware of the perils of \u2018black box AI\u2019 \u2013 an artificial\nintelligence system where decisions cannot be explained.\n\n\u201cWe started from the mindset of making hiring fairer. We know the bad things\nthat can happen from the wrong uses of technology, we stayed away from deep\nneural nets,\u201d Ahuja said.\n\n\u201cOur tech isn\u2019t a black box, it breaks it down into competencies. The machine\nlearning happens within these competencies \u2013 you break down the black box\nproblem into smaller pieces and then you make sure you\u2019re following the best\npractices in each of them.\u201d\n\n## AI interviewing AI?\n\nIn fact, Impress took a stance that almost all of the content in a person\u2019s CV\nwould remain outside the hiring process.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t rate the CVs at all,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of the bias\ncomes from. Even when companies ask us to do that, we say: \u2018Sorry but that\u2019s a\ndangerous territory and that goes against certain principles\u2019.\u201d\n\n> The team at <https://t.co/CCEV29J7tt> shared the Future of Work for the\n> Asian Development Bank \u2013 ADB during Digital Week.\n> [@ADB_HQ](https://twitter.com/ADB_HQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \u2013 thank you for\n> hosting us at your headquarters in Manila, Philippines and for the\n> exposure![#futureofwork](https://twitter.com/hashtag/futureofwork?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#AI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#HRTech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRTech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#impressai](https://twitter.com/hashtag/impressai?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [pic.twitter.com/Y14lOFiArW](https://t.co/Y14lOFiArW)\n>\n> \u2014 impress.ai \u2013 AI Chatbot Software for Recruiters (@impressAI) [September 5,\n> 2019](https://twitter.com/impressAI/status/1169488130186940417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nExperience written in the CV is anonymised, he added, with approximately 80pc\nof the decision to hire the candidate based on the answers given to the\nchatbot. While the Impress team seem to be happy with where the technology is\nat right now, Ahuja said that the future of HR chatbots lies beyond just\npreliminary interviews, particularly during the onboarding process.\n\nHe described the combination of competency for a role and a person\u2019s\nperformance as a \u201choly grail\u201d, providing employers with decisions that deliver\nthe highest financial returns.\n\nIn that same vein, I asked whether \u2013 somewhat ironically \u2013 does Impress fear\nthe rise of automation with an increasingly AI workforce threatening its\nbusiness, or if AI will inevitably interview AI?\n\n\u201cWe have thought about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s about five or more\nyears away. But you\u2019re going to have companies that are going to be looking\nfor AI-plus-human combinations in the future for many jobs.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even if the economy goes bad, businesses need to decrease cost,\nwhich is what we do. Both ways the scenarios are positive for us, we just\nprobably have to adjust according to where the market is.\u201d\n\n_Disclosure: The journalist\u2019s trip to Singapore was provided by the Infocomm\nMedia Development Authority_\n\n[__Tweet](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fcareers%2Fimpress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-work&text=Could+your+next+first-\nround+interview+be+with+a+chatbot%3F&via=siliconrepublic)\n[__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-\nwork)[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=287597001601476&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fcareers%2Fimpress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-\nwork&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fcareers%2Fimpress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-work) [__Email](mailto:?subject=Could your next\nfirst-round interview be with a\nchatbot?&body=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-ai-chatbot-\nrecruitment-future-work)\n[__Share](whatsapp://send?text=Could%20your%20next%20first-\nround%20interview%20be%20with%20a%20chatbot%3F%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fcareers%2Fimpress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-work) [More]()\n\n[__Share](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-work) [__Pin\nThis](javascript:void\\(\\(function\\(\\)%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement\\('script'\\);e.setAttribute\\('type','text/javascript'\\);e.setAttribute\\('charset','UTF-8'\\);e.setAttribute\\('src','//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r='+Math.random\\(\\)*99999999\\);document.body.appendChild\\(e\\)%7D\\)\\(\\)\\);)\n[__Reddit](http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-\nai-chatbot-recruitment-future-work&title=Could your next first-round interview\nbe with a chatbot?)\n\nIn-Depth: [Future of Work Week](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-\nof-work-week)\n\nRelated: [Singapore](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/singapore),\n[HR](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/hr), [future of\nwork](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/future-of-work),\n[AI](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/ai),\n[entrepreneurs](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/entrepreneurs),\n[recruitment](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/recruitment)\n\n[![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/colm-\ngorey.jpg)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/author/colmgorey)\n\nBy Colm Gorey\n\nAs an award-winning editor for Consumer Magazine of the Year 2013, Colm joined\nSiliconrepublic.com in January 2014 as a journalist covering AI, IoT, science\nand anything that will get us to Mars quicker.

The move is expected to bring greater certainty,\nsecurity and growth to blockchain-related projects in the country, with\nBOSAGORA perfectly poised to take advantage.\n\n _ **Recommended AI News:**_[ _Cryptocurrency Volatility \u2013 A Friend Or A\nFoe_](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/cryptocurrency-volatility-a-\nfriend-or-a-foe/)\n\nFirst created in 2017, the BOSAGORA project produced an updated whitepaper in\n2019 to clarify its core concepts and to set the foundation for its future\nsuccess. This provided the catalyst to its rapid development and growth\ntowards the end of 2019.\n\nThe BOSAGORA vision is of a project-enabling blockchain, supported by the\nrobust functionality of its Trust Contracts, and galvanized by the adaptive\nand equitable nature of its democratic governance. These elements combine to\ncreate a forward-thinking, fair and dependable blockchain focused on securing\nongoing success. Through these systems, as well as a series of other\nmechanisms, BOSAGORA creates the first smart contract blockchain powered by\nthe collective intelligence of its users.\n\n _ **Recommended AI News:**_[ _Concentra Launches TrueCue, Its Combined\nAnalytics Products & Services\nBrand_](https://www.aithority.com/technology/analytics/concentra-launches-\ntruecue-its-combined-analytics-products-services-brand/)\n\nThe project is further bolstered by its scalability, as it plays host to an\nin-built second layer solution called the **Flash Layer**. In some ways\nsimilar in concept to Bitcoin's Lightning Network, BOA's Flash Layer allows\nfor the near-instantaneous confirmation of transactions without adding\nadditional strain to the blockchain, or settlement layer.\n\nIn bringing together a fair and inclusive approach, a combination of\ninnovative technological dimensions and a team consisting of some of the most\nrespected experts in the field of blockchain, BOSAGORA looks set to become one\nof the most talked-about and used blockchains of 2020 with the potential to\ndrastically change the face of the cryptosphere as we know it today.\n\n ** _Recommended AI News:_**[ _Skills to Master Before your First Data Science\nInterview_](https://www.aithority.com/technology/big-data/skills-to-master-\nbefore-your-first-data-science-interview/ \"Skills to Master Before your First\nData Science Interview\")\n\n[Adaptive](https://www.aithority.com/tag/adaptive/)\n[BOA](https://www.aithority.com/tag/boa/)\n[BOSAGORA](https://www.aithority.com/tag/bosagora/) [digital\ncurrency](https://www.aithority.com/tag/digital-currency/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/) 2020-03-12\n\n**[AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/ \"Posts by\nAIT News Desk\") **\n\nTags [Adaptive](https://www.aithority.com/tag/adaptive/)\n[BOA](https://www.aithority.com/tag/boa/)\n[BOSAGORA](https://www.aithority.com/tag/bosagora/) [digital\ncurrency](https://www.aithority.com/tag/digital-currency/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/)\n\n[__\nTwitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=https://www.aithority.com/technology/blockchain/bosagora-\ncontinues-to-impress-as-digital-currency-boa-lists-on-bithumb/\n\"BOSAGORA+Continues+to+Impress+as+Digital+Currency+BOA+Lists+on+Bithumb\") [__\nFacebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.aithority.com/technology/blockchain/bosagora-\ncontinues-to-impress-as-digital-currency-boa-lists-on-bithumb/) [__ Google\n+](https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=https://www.aithority.com/technology/blockchain/bosagora-\ncontinues-to-impress-as-digital-currency-boa-lists-on-bithumb/) [__\nlinkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.aithority.com/technology/blockchain/bosagora-\ncontinues-to-impress-as-digital-currency-boa-lists-on-bithumb/ \"BOSAGORA\nContinues to Impress as Digital Currency BOA Lists on Bithumb\") More\n\n###  Authors\n\n![AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Newsdesk-180-x-180-150x150.jpg)\n\nPosted by : [AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/\n\"Posts by AIT News Desk\")\n\nAIT News Desk is a trained group of web journalists and reporters who collect\nnews from all over the technology landscape.

has opened door for 75 firms to $430m worth of deals in\npast 5 years\n\n[Lester Wong](/authors/lester-wong)\n\n[lesterw@sph.com.sg](mailto:lesterw@sph.com.sg \"lesterw@sph.com.sg\")\n\nAn initiative to help tech start-ups secure government tenders has opened the\ndoor for 75 firms to more than $430 million worth of deals in the past five\nyears that they might otherwise have missed out on.\n\nThe Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) initiative has two strands -\nAccreditation @ SGD caters to more established companies, while Spark focuses\non firms at an earlier stage of development.\n\nCompanies are evaluated on the technical, financial and operational aspects of\ntheir business. Those that receive the stamp of approval get first\nconsideration for government projects and benefit from a streamlined\nprocurement process that shortens the amount of time needed to close a deal.\n\nThe IMDA also actively showcases accredited companies to potential government\nand enterprise customers to raise their profile.\n\nMore than 1,000 projects have been awarded to companies under the two\nprogrammes.\n\nAccreditation @ SGD started in 2014 in response to the challenges faced by\nlocal technology companies in securing new customers quickly because of their\nunproven track records.\n\n\"Getting business from government agencies is always very hard. Before they\nbuy from you, the agencies usually need real examples and justification, often\nfrom other agencies. It's a chicken-and-egg situation,\" said Mr Daryl Neo, co-\nfounder and chief executive of fintech start-up DC Frontiers, which developed\nan artificial intelligence-powered business intelligence database called\nHandshakes.\n\nThe firm, formed in 2011, grew its number of government clients from one to 20\nwithin two years of being accredited in October 2016.\n\nSpark was launched in November last year after IMDA realised that\nAccreditation @ SGD's rigorous criteria would disqualify an increasing number\nof promising tech start-ups at an early stage of development that it wanted to\nsupport, said IMDA director of enterprise growth acceleration Edwin Low.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Start-ups leveraging growth opportunities at innovation\nhub](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/engine-room-for-start-ups-in-spore-\ngets-a-makeover)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [A LaunchPad that gives start-ups flexibility to\ngrow](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/a-launchpad-that-gives-start-ups-\nflexibility-to-grow)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Biopolis to expand as part of moves to better support biotech start-\nups](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/biopolis-to-\nexpand-as-part-of-moves-to-better-support-biotech-start-ups)\n\n\"At the same time, we saw an opportunity to assist a broader group of\ncompanies, including those in IT services, hardware and consumer tech products\nand services,\" he added.\n\nLocal artificial intelligence (AI) start-up impress.AI was one of the\ncompanies that would otherwise have fallen through the gap.\n\nIts product is an AI recruiting tool that helps companies automate parts of\ntheir hiring processes.\n\nChief executive Sudhanshu Ahuja said joining Spark helped it increase its\ngovernment client base from one to 10 and greatly shortened the tender process\nto about three months - around a third of the time it took previously. \"IMDA\nhas shown a deep understanding of what start-ups need, such as closing deals\nquickly,\" he added.\n\n* * *\n\n**This article has been edited for clarity.**\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non December 30, 2019, with the headline 'Helping tech start-ups secure govt\nprojects'.

As President Xi Jinping toured the [coronavirus-stricken\ncity of Wuhan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-very-\nhomesick-wuhan-residents-trickle-back-to-stricken-city) this week, setting the\ntone for an official narrative that China will win a \"People's War\", numerous\nsocial media users went to extraordinary lengths to make an alternative voice\nheard.\n\nThe [effort to get around China's\ncensors](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinas-internet-users-\nget-creative-skirting-censors-over-coronavirus-whistleblower) and publish the\nwords of Wuhan doctor Ai Fen, the first to sound the alarm over the virus, was\namong the most elaborate in an outpouring of dissent against the government\nnarrative as the outbreak exacts a devastating human and economic toll.\n\nIn a bid to fool censors' AI software, netizens translated an interview with\nDr Ai, head of the emergency room at Wuhan Central Hospital, into at least\nfive languages and reformatted it in at least 22 ways.\n\nThe text was rendered backwards, into emojis, Braille, oracle bone script,\nMorse code, song sheets and even the Elvish language from Lord of the Rings.\n\n\"The scale and intensity of the pushback against propaganda during this virus\noutbreak is unprecedented,\" said Professor Zhan Jiang from Beijing Foreign\nStudies University.\n\n\"To some extent, the '404 system' has collapsed temporarily,\" he told Reuters,\nreferring to the error message that appears when content has been moved or\ndeleted. \"It will bounce back into this seesaw game with the netizens.\"\n\nUnder Mr Xi, censorship has steadily tightened. Associate Professor Alfred Wu\nat the National University of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy\nexpects that to continue after the virus outbreak.\n\n\"Aware that many are unhappy, it is in the nature of the party to adopt the\nstrategy of offence as defence,\" he said, referring to the ruling Communist\nParty.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's Internet regulator, did\nnot reply to a request for comment.\n\nMr Xi acknowledged the suffering of those infected or forced to stay at home\nwhen he visited Wuhan.\n\n\"People under lengthy quarantine have some frustrations to vent\", which should\nbe understood and tolerated, state television cited him as saying.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus microsite: Get latest updates, videos and graphics\n](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/wuhan-virus-follow-our-coverage)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so\nfar](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-cases-in-singapore-\nwhat-we-know-so-far)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: Mainland China reports 8 new confirmed\ncases](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-mainland-china-\nreports-8-new-confirmed-cases)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [How China turned the tide on the\ncoronavirus](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/how-china-turned-the-\ntide-on-the-coronavirus)\n\nIn the article that was repeatedly deleted and reposted, Dr Ai recounted how\ninstead of taking early precautions after she warned others about the virus,\nthe hospital chastised her for spreading rumours and causing panic - part of\nthe suppression of early information that exacerbated the spread of Sars-\nCoV-2.\n\n\"Had I known how things would turn out, I wouldn't care if I got criticised. I\nwould've told the whole world,\" Dr Ai, who has lost patients and colleagues to\nthe coronavirus, said in the interview with Chinese magazine People, giving a\ngrim account of deaths and the strain on medical staff.\n\nNeither Dr Ai nor a hospital representative could immediately be reached for\ncomment.\n\n#### 'DECISIVE BATTLE'\n\nMr Xi, who was conspicuously absent from state media coverage in the\noutbreak's early days, has become the face of the virus fight. [After his\nWuhan visit](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinas-xi-jinping-\npays-first-visit-to-coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan), state news outlet Xinhua\nposted a video, \"The People's Leader commanding the decisive battle.\"\n\nThere is little sign that Mr Xi has been politically weakened by the outbreak.\nIndeed, the worsening global pandemic makes China's response look effective,\nstrengthening Beijing's official narrative.\n\nAfter Mr Xi visited a Wuhan hospital and stood in front of a red banner that\nsaid, \"Resolutely winning the people's war\", Ms Fang Fang, a Wuhan novelist\nwho has gained a following by posting diary entries about life in a city under\nlockdown, wrote: \"Remember, there is no win, only an end.\"\n\nMs Fang's postings are often scrubbed from social media, but her blog is\nintact on Caixin, an independent media outlet, where each entry gets tens of\nthousands of reads.\n\nThe death from coronavirus last month of Dr Li Wenliang, a doctor from the\nsame Wuhan hospital and one of the eight given a police warning for\ncirculating Dr Ai's message about the disease, triggered a rare outpouring of\noutrage against the authorities. The government ended up honouring Dr Li among\nmore than 500 \"model healthcare workers\".\n\n\"A healthy society should have more than one voice,\" Dr Li said in a Caixin\ninterview before his death from the virus, in what became a rallying cry for\nfree speech among Chinese netizens.\n\nLast week, a rare view of public anger involving a top central official went\nviral: a video clip showed residents of a Wuhan apartment complex accusing\nemployees of staging the delivery of groceries to impress a high-level\ninspection tour, jeering, \"It's fake!\".\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Luxe

Zhonglin's launch of a \"gratitude\neducation\" campaign asking residents to be thankful to Mr Xi and the party\ntriggered backlash.\n\n\"Anyone with a conscience would not demand the people of Wuhan, still reeling\nfrom shock, to be grateful,\" commentator Chu Zhaoxin said in a WeChat article\nthat went viral.\n\nThe official newspaper article announcing Mr Wang's campaign was later\nremoved.\n\n#### Related Stories:\n\n![The Ace Building along Paya Lebar Road, where The Life Church and Missions\nSingapore

The company has demonstrated a[new\nfeature](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-can-filter-out-the-sound-of-you-\neating-potato-chips-on-a-conference-call/) for its Teams video conferencing\ntool that will use artificial intelligence to identify sounds that aren't your\nvoice and filter them out. So yes, that means you'll be safe to snack away.\n\nMicrosoft's \"real-time noise suppression\" will be available later this year.\nIt's just one of several new features for distraction-less video chatting.\nMicrosoft has also shown off a feature to [blur out the\nbackground](https://www.cnet.com/news/skype-can-now-blur-the-background-to-\nhide-your-messy-house/) of a video chat and add [live\ncaptioning](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-adds-live-captions-to-skype-\nand-powerpoint/), a la YouTube.\n\nIn the meantime, here are more smart, simple tips for holding better video\nconferences until we're all able to go back to the office.\n\n**1\\. Set up a stable and secure internet connection.**\n\nThe last thing you want during a video conference is a laggy connection that\ndisrupts your audio and visuals, creating a pixelated mess. To set up a stable\nconnection every time, use an Ethernet cable. If you have a newer laptop,\nthere's a pretty good chance you don't have a native Ethernet port, but you\ncan purchase a dongle on Amazon that will adapt your Ethernet cable to the\nports you do have.\n\n[ USB-C to Ethernet Adapter Anker amazon.com $19.99  Buy Now\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZZ6NW5E?linkCode=ogi)\n\n**2\\. Turn off applications and stop downloads.**\n\nEven if you have a great internet connection, running a bunch of programs that\nheavily draw on your Central Processing Unit (CPU) can break up the quality of\nyour call. Turn off downloads and close out of as many applications as you\ncan.\n\n **3\\. Consider upgrading your equipment.**\n\nYour laptop's built-in webcam, mic, and speakers probably perform just fine\n(be sure to test them before your big call), but if you want to impress,\nconsider investing in an external microphone or webcam for better quality.\n\n[ Webcam with Mic Hrayzan amazon.com $43.99  Buy Now\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3S1TCG?linkCode=ogi)\n\n**4\\. Step up your lighting.**\n\nWithout the right lighting, your audience could be left in the dark-literally.\nNatural light is best, but if your home's windows aren't conducive to that\nkind of setup, you can use artificial lighting. [Fluorescent\nlights](https://www.information-age.com/top-10-tips-effective-video-\nconferencing-123466657/) are best, but be sure not to use any overpowering\nbulbs. If the lighting is too bright, try backing away from the source a bit\n(but watch out for shadows).\n\nRelated Stories\n\n[\n![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/16/39/1474919664-temporalis-1474919633245.gif?crop=1xw:0.8895833333333333xh;center,top&resize=300:*)\nUse Your Webcam To Make Gorgeously Glitchy GIFs\n](/technology/design/a23050/temporalis-will-turn-your-webcam-into-gifs/) [\n![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-\nshot-2019-08-20-at-3-36-04-pm-1566329812.png?crop=0.997xw:0.667xh;0.00160xw,0.333xh&resize=300:*)\nThe World's Longest Running Webcam Will Go Offline\n](/technology/a28762872/fogcam-goes-offline/) [\n![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/16/42/768x384/landscape-1477083540-getty.jpg?resize=300:*)\nHow Hackers Wrecked the Internet Using Webcams\n](/technology/infrastructure/a23504/mirai-botnet-internet-of-things-ddos-\nattack/)\n\n**5\\.

Retail investors with at least S$1,000 to invest will be able to\ntap DBS's wealth management expertise to buy a portfolio of exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs) by the end of this month.\n\nThe [r](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dbs-launches-robo-investor-to-\nencourage-more-singaporeans-to-invest)[obo-investment platform,\ndigiPortfolio](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dbs-launches-robo-\ninvestor-to-encourage-more-singaporeans-to-invest), combines investment\nstrategies from the bank's wealth management team, which are traditionally\nlimited to private banking customers, with computer algorithms to help\nautomate the investment process.\n\nThis sets the Singapore bank apart from the other nine digital advisory\nservices in the market, which provide portfolio advice with no direct human\ninvolvement.\n\nThe use of technology has helped the bank avail some of the services to all\ncustomers that in the past was \"almost impossible to do so\", said Mr Jeremy\nSoo, DBS' Singapore head of consumer banking group at a media briefing on\nMonday (Sept 2).\n\n\"Either you bring a lot of money to join a wealth management platform, (or\nelse) all these things are not available to you,\" he noted.\n\nFor a start, the bank is offering retail investors with two portfolio options\non its online banking platform.\n\nThe Asia Portfolio, which requires a minimum investment sum of S$1,000,\ncomprises Singapore Exchange (SGX)-listed ETFs that provides investors with\nexposure to the Singapore, China and India equities markets, as well as the\nSingapore bond markets. This portfolio can be purchased by customers with no\nprior investment experience.\n\nFor those who are looking for global diversification, they can choose the\nGlobal Portfolio with UK-listed ETFs starting wiith US$1,000.\n\n![Impress.AI chief executive officer and co-founder Sudhanshu Ahuja \\(second\nfrom left\\) with DBS staff, including Mr Bidyut Dumra \\(second from right\\),\nthe bank\u2019s head of Innovation.

Investors are also not subject to a lock-in period.\n\nA team of portfolio managers led by Mr Christophe Marciano, head of\ndiscretionary portfolio management, will review the portfolios on a quarterly\nbasis to ensure that they remain resilient to market volatility, provide\noptimal returns, and remain aligned to DBS Chief Investment Office's views.\n\n\"But there are no constraints to do so more frequently,\" said Mr Marciano,\nwhen rebalancing is deemed necessary.\n\nThis hybrid human-robo investment platform was first made available in March\nto DBS Treasures customers, who have at least S$350,000 in assets under the\nbank's management.\n\nBy opening up access to this service, the lender aims to lower the barriers to\npersonal investing for all retail investors.\n\nEventually it hopes to allow investors to use their Supplementary Retirement\nScheme and Central Provident Fund accounts to invest in these portfolios.\n\nThe early access sign-up for the service is now open and will close on Sept 30\nand the bank will inform those who have signed up once they are allowed\naccess.\n\nThe service will eventually be fully opened after this introductory phase.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS](/tags/banks-and-financial-institutions)\n  * [DBS](/tags/dbs)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=09/02/2019&title=DBS to\noffer hybrid human-robo investment solution to retail investors)\n\nPermalink: http://str.sg/JZFd Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=09/02/2019&title=DBS to\noffer hybrid human-robo investment solution to retail investors)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=09/02/2019&title=DBS\nto offer hybrid human-robo investment solution to retail investors)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=dbs-to-roll-out-exchange-traded-funds-for-retail-\ninvestors-by-end-of-third-quarter)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

They were\ninefficient; they took too long to get back to customers; they spent too many\nresources on not delivering good quality products.\n\n\"We were able to significantly help them. We reduced the time they needed to\nget back to customers from an average of five days, to getting back to 80% of\ncustomers on the same day.\"\n\n##  'Godfathers never change'\n\nBuoyed by this initial success, Rinke approached Hasso Platner, the founder of\nenterprise software giant SAP.\n\n\"He was giving a speech very close to where I grew up - I grew up in Berlin,\"\nsaid Rinke. \"I heard about this speech and went there.\n\n\"He disappeared after the speech to the VIP area and stayed there for three\nhours or so.\n\n\"I waited there until he got out, and said to him: 'You've got to hear about\nCelonis; you're missing out.' I showed him some screenshots of our work and he\nlooked at them and loved it.\"\n\nPlatner gave the young trio an intro to SAP, something that would contribute\nto the firm's success.\n\n\"When you come with a recommendation from the founder, you have a much better\nshot at being taken seriously,\" said Rinke.\n\nIn 2016, Celonis [ announced a reseller agreement with\nSAP](https://www.celonis.com/press/celonis-announces-global-reseller-\nagreement-with-sap) that gave existing SAP customers direct access to its\ntechnology.\n\nIn November, it [ raised $290 million in a Series C funding\nround](https://www.businessinsider.com/german-business-process-outfit-celonis-\nraises-funds-at-25-billion-valuation-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T) led by Arena\nHoldings and investors including Ryan Smith, the founder of customer\nexperience specialist Qualtrics that was bought by SAP for $8 billion a year\nago. The firm is valued at $2.5 billion.\n\n![Rinke pitched Hasso Plattner in 3 minutes, after standing outside a\nconference VIP area for 3 hours just to get the chance to pitch\nhim.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2020/03/03/56d5bbb92e5265ba008ba713.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Rinke pitched Hasso Plattner in 3 minutes, after standing outside a conference VIP area for 3 hours just to get the chance to pitch him.\nsource\n\n    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nBack in those early, bootstrapped days, large customers, let alone large\nbusiness partners, were a distant dream. Rinke and his cofounders knew\nCelonis's tools would best fit large firms - and yet, as is the law of the\nbusiness jungle, large firms are the hardest to impress.\n\nAs such, they had to think hard about how to attract big firms' attention. The\nmethod they settled on was startlingly low-tech: they sent out 1,500\nhandwritten letters to every C-suite big shot under the sun.\n\n\"We thought, 'Each of them has an office and assistants, so we won't really\nget far by calling them',\" Rinke said.\n\n\"So, the idea was that if we hand wrote letters, we would actually get to the\nsenior executives, because if they receive a handwritten letter, it could be\ntheir grandmother; it could be somebody really important or a personal\nemergency or whatever.\n\n\"And it worked - people really did open the letters. I mean, you send out\n1,500 letters and you win maybe two or three Fortune 500 clients. It's not a\nhuge number percentage-wise, but it's pretty meaningful.\"\n\nSoon enough, these left-field marketing tactics became something of a\nspecialty.\n\n##  'Harley Davidsons aren't that expensive - they're just really, really\ncool'\n\nIn one instance, the company offered up a Harley Davidson bike, which starts\nat about \u00a37,000, just to attract potential customers.\n\n\"We did that [sort of thing] more often, actually, and it was quite funny,\"\nRinke continued. \"We had the smallest booth at a massive conference - it was\nmaybe 22,000 or 23,000 people - and people were literally queueing up in front\nof this tiny booth because they could win a Harley Davidson.\n\n\"When you think about it, Harley Davidsons aren't that expensive - they're\njust really, really cool. We got permission from the conference to bring it\nin, which I didn't expect at all, but once we had permission, it was just so\ncool.\"\n\nCelonis soon took off with the speed of a motorbike. Its customers today [\ninclude Uber, Vodafone, and Cisco, as well as numerous firms from outside tech\nlike\nL'Oreal](https://www.celonis.com/customers/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=Search_BRAND).\n\n\"I think our set of competitors will evolve,\" Rinke said. \"But, right now, our\nbiggest rival is the status quo. What I mean by that is people doing things\nmanually or just trying to throw RPA (robotic process automation) at processes\nthey don't even understand and haven't analyzed.\"\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Alex Rinke](/tag/alex-rinke/)\n  * [Celonis](/tag/celonis/)\n  * [Hasso Plattner](/tag/hasso-plattner/)\n  * [process mining](/tag/process-mining/)\n  * [SAP](/tag/sap/)\n\n[[Charlie Wood](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/charlie-wood/?IR=T),\n[Business Insider\nUS](http://www.businessinsider.com/?IR=T)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/author/businessinsider)\n\n#### Popular Articles\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3369975-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\") [[100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 -- here's a list of all the classes open for free enrollment](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\")](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses)\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3223732-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/how-long-can-coronavirus-live-on-surfaces-how-to-disinfect-2020-3 \"The coronavirus can live on a surgical mask for 7 days, cloth for 2 days, and paper for 3 hours.

The U.S. and Europe can learn from how China's\ndigital savvy consumers have been working with the digitally enabled supply\nchains managed by China's big tech companies to guarantee essential supplies\nto people and communities in quarantine.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_17_1147051068.jpg) Jorg\nGreuel/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/delivery-technology-is-keeping-chinese-cities-\nafloat-through-coronavirus?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.\n\nFor the last month, China\u2019s cities, with their empty streets and deserted\nshopping malls, have looked like the set of a post-apocalypse TV series.  It\nmay be a glimpse of the future for Europe and North America, where lockdowns\nare quickly expanding.\n\nPublic discourse in Europe and the U.S. is predictably focused on how bad\nthings will get and the practicalities of life under lockdown: How will people\nget food supplies? Can the medical services cope? Will people get paid?\n\nBut even at this stage in the lifecycle of the Covid-19 pandemic, some lessons\nare already emerging from China about how we can cope with the social and\ncommercial disruption of this kind. A key driver, it turns out, is digital\ntechnology.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at China, where the most recent signs suggest that the\nepidemic has now stabilized. In Wuhan \u2014 a city of 11 million people \u2014 the\nlockdown posed a serious problem. Because it was the first city affected, its\ncitizens were unprepared for what they faced. Initially, [the lockdown imposed\nby the Chinese authorities triggered panic\nbuying](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-\nanger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown) of food and other essential\nitems, emptying supermarket shelves.\n\nYet in a matter of days, supplies began to flow into Wuhan. Although fears and\nconcerns about the disease ran high, residents fairly quickly came to terms\nwith the lockdown and have leveraged digital technology to organize and\ncollaborate with suppliers, thereby ensuring that supplies have reached the\npeople who need them the most.  Two factors have contributed to this\nremarkable show of resilience:\n\n  * **Digitally Enabled Delivery Systems:  **In China\u2019s major cities, groceries and other items purchased online can be delivered to the home within as little as 20 minutes following a purchase.  This is largely down to the deployment of digital technology.  Alibaba\u2019s [Cainiao network](https://www.alizila.com/cainiao-network/), for example, supports the supply chains of the merchants it serves via an AI-enabled digital inventory system that links the online and offline shopping worlds, in which merchants\u2019 physical stores serve an extended distribution network.  As a result, almost as soon as the lockdown was declared in Wuhan, Alibaba was shipping medical and food supplies into the province.\n  * **Consumer Comfort with the Online World:  **In the past five years, Alibaba Group, JD.com, MTDP (Meituan Dianping) and many other companies have transformed the purchasing behavior of Chinese consumers, moving them away from bricks-and-mortar shopping into online spaces, often consolidated through a so-called \u201c[super app](https://www.forbes.com/sites/betsyatkins/2019/09/03/are-super-apps-the-future/#a95a78c6fd54).\u201d  As of 2019, China\u2019s e-commerce penetration had, [by one estimate](https://en.cifnews.com/emarketer-the-top-global-e-commerce-market-will-be-china/), reached 36.6% of retail sales, [with 71% of Chinese consumers transacting online](https://www.dragonsocial.net/blog/top-china-shopping-apps-china-ecommerce/) at some point, mostly via smartphone apps (80% of e-commerce transactions).\n\nThe combination of consumer digital maturity and digitally supported supply\nchains has enabled local residents to organize home delivery of essential\nsupplies to people in self-quarantine.  In the gated communities and\nneighborhoods that characterize Beijing, for example, residents have organized\nsmall groups of volunteers via group chat apps to receive supplies at the gate\nfor the whole community, box them for each household, and deliver them to\npeople\u2019s doorsteps.\n\nIn the U.S. and Europe, however, the digital landscape seems rather less\nfavorable for this kind of response than in China.\n\nAlthough U.S. consumers are more than ready to shop on Amazon and other\ne-commerce platforms, [only 16% of total sales in\n2019](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/) were on\ne-commerce platforms \u2014 a number achieved in China four years earlier.\n\nMoreover, groceries and ready-to-eat food remain challenging categories in the\ndigital world, despite efforts to experiment with home delivery of foodstuffs\non the part of Walmart.com and Amazon, which recently purchased Whole Foods.\nU.S. consumers have been much slower to shift to the digital marketplace in\nthese categories than the Chinese, while last-mile logistics for the grocery\ncategory have yet to reach the standards seen in China\u2019s major cities. Even in\nthe restaurant business, the likes of Uber Eats and others lag far behind\nChina\u2019s MTDP, Ele.me, and many other similar services in China.\n\nEurope, unfortunately, is even further behind. Although large retailers such\nas Ooshop.com of Carrefour and start-ups like Deliveroo are building last-mile\nlogistical capacities, consumer demand and readiness are low, while old city\ninfrastructures and labor regulations make the rapid construction of an\nefficient delivery system an extremely challenging proposition.\n\nJust last fall, while Alibaba and Amazon celebrated their achievements during\nthe [Singles\u2019 Day](/2019/12/for-alibaba-singles-day-is-about-more-than-huge-\nsales) and Thanksgiving sales respectively, large merchants in Europe ran into\nserious difficulties in handling their logistics for \u201cBlack Friday\u201d sales. I\npersonally received apologetic letters and cancelation messages from a major\nFrench electronic retailer, which admitted, \u201cWe had unforeseeable difficulties\nin handling the large amount of transactions during the Black Friday period.\u201d\nThat is forgivable if all that happened was that one failed to impress a\nfriend with a new gadget. When feeding their children is the issue, consumers\nwill be less indulgent.\n\nOf course, the pandemic will subside \u2013 and Americans and Europeans will find\nways to cope with its effects; the Chinese do not have a monopoly on\ncreativity and solidarity.  But as the U.S. and Europe emerge from the\ncoronavirus epidemic, their governments, cities, and businesses should look at\nhow China\u2019s digital advantages have helped it respond to the logistic\nchallenges presented by the crisis. Covid 19 is a wakeup call for European and\nthe U.S., which both need to accelerate the digital transformation of their\neconomies \u2014 ahead of the next pandemic.\n\n* * *\n\n[Chengyi Lin](/search?term=chengyi%20lin&search_type=search-all) is an\naffiliate professor in strategy at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [TECHNOLOGY](/topic/technology)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Supply chain](/topic/supply-chain)\n  * [Mobile](/topic/mobile)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

I trust that I\nwill impress the judges.\"\n\nTurns out, her bold move paid off -- apart from Katy, she made an impression\non _AI_ judges **[Lionel\nRichie](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a31911981/american-\nidol-2020-judge-lionel-richie-arthur-gunn-reaction/)** and **[Luke\nBryan](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a26859353/luke-\nbryan-wife-caroline-boyer/) **as well and ultimately made it through to the\nnext round.\n\n\"Last night, you walked on that stage, and you were the definition of\nelegance,\" [Katy told Just Sam following her\nperformance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfavP8QgGNY). Lionel added, \"I\ncouldn't have been more proud if you were my own child.\" At the end, Luke\nrevealed that whenever she \"walks in,\" the judges immediately \"start smiling.\"\n\nFans couldn't have agreed more with the judges and their positive feedback.\nViewers immediately began sharing their love and support all over social\nmedia.\n\n\"I WAS SO SURPRISED OMG I LOVED IT,\" [one person\ntweeted](https://twitter.com/KatycatTeagan/status/1244438574860288000). \"AND A\nSELENA SONG MY HEART DROPPED I LOVE HER SO MUCH,\" [another\nadded](https://twitter.com/Marispiva/status/1244438627544940544). \"She looked\nstunning and just popped out a Selena song?? So good,\" [a different fan wrote\non YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfavP8QgGNY). \"SHE NEEDS TO WIN\nTHIS WHOLE THING! \ud83d\udc97,\" [another commented on\nInstagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YT035JRIf/).\n\nConfirming what she talked to Bobby about earlier, the subway singer later\ntold the judges that although her last name is Diaz, she [doesn't know\nSpanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfavP8QgGNY) -- something\n[Selena](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a30860047/netflix-\nselena-the-series-start-date-cast-spoilers/) would have related to. As her\nfans know, Selena transcended language barriers, in part because she sang in\nSpanish but [wasn't actually\nfluent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgWBKflgnyo). Now, twenty-five years\nafter her tragic death on March 31, 1995, Selena continues to be one of the\nmost beloved artists of all time.\n\nIt's fair to say that Just Sam did justice to the memory of the iconic\n\"Mexican Madonna.\"\n\nRelated Story\n\n[ ![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/american-\nidol-2020-judge-lionel-richie-arthur-gunn-\nreaction-1585069866.jpg?crop=0.835xw:1.00xh;0.0913xw,0&resize=300:*) Lionel\nRichie Was Left In Tears By Arthur Gunn\n](/life/entertainment/a31911981/american-idol-2020-judge-lionel-richie-arthur-\ngunn-reaction/)\n\n[ Selena Barrientos ](/author/221589/Selena-Barrientos/) Editorial Assistant\nSelena Barrientos is the editorial assistant at GoodHousekeeping.com covering\nentertainment news and social content.\n\n[](/life/entertainment/a31349090/who-is-astronaut-on-the-masked-singer/)\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMore From [Entertainment](/life/entertainment/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nWhy Matt Roloff Says Amy's Book Is \"Disingenuous\"\n](/life/entertainment/a32068283/matt-amy-roloff-divorce-book-reaction/)\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\nWho Is Banana on \u2018The Masked Singer\u2019?

Snapchat's users loved how\nStories gave them a carefree way to post (in contrast with Facebook, where\nyour posts would go to everyone and stick around forever) and the app's usage\nexploded. Spiegel, who once spurned a $3 billion acquisition offer from\nZuckerberg, was now hitting him where it hurt. In the zero-sum game of social\nmedia, where time spent on one platform is time not spent on another, Spiegel\nhad the energy, the sharing, and was driving his company toward a hot IPO.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs Snapchat took off, an 18-year-old developer named Michael Sayman joined\nFacebook. Sayman had built a game that caught Zuckerberg's eye, and the\ncompany hired him as a full-time engineer in 2015. Sitting through\norientation, Sayman heard speeches about how Facebook's leaders would listen\nto anyone's ideas, and took the message to heart. \"I believed it,\" he told me.\nBefore orientation was over, he spun up a presentation about how teens,\nalready drifting to Snapchat, were using technology, and how Facebook might\nwant to build for them.\n\nStill barely old enough to buy a lottery ticket, Sayman started presenting his\nideas to Facebook's executives and soon found himself in front of Zuckerberg.\nHis presentation didn't initially impress. But Chris Cox, then Facebook's head\nof product, convinced Zuckerberg to give him a small team to experiment.\n\"There was no blueprint,\" Sayman told me. \"I had a few ideas, people thought\nthat they should let me be creative, they gave me the headcount to be\ncreative, and there was no problem.\"\n\nAs time went on, Sayman watched his fellow teens sharing less on Facebook's\nfamily of apps, and more on Snapchat. He turned his focus to Snapchat Stories,\nwhich he believed Facebook should build into its products. \"I wanted the\ncompany to feel like Snapchat was an existential threat,\" he said. \"I wanted\nFacebook to panic.\"\n\n **Alex Kantrowitz** [Photo: courtesy of David Fitzgerald/Web Summit via\nSportsfile]Sayman brought his concerns to Zuckerberg, who had heard from\nothers who came to similar conclusions. As a teenager, Sayman was invaluable.\nHe could help Zuckerberg learn Snapchat's culture. \"He would point us to --\nHere's the media that I follow, or here are the people I think are\ninfluential, who are cool,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I'd go follow those people, or\ntalk to them, have them come in. That ends up being the iterative process of\nlearning what matters.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he followed these tastemakers on Instagram, but confirmed he's\na Snapchat user too. \"I try to use all the stuff,\" he told me. \"If you want to\nlearn, there are so many lessons out there where people will tell you about\nthings you're not doing as well as you could. People tell you so much if you\njust care about understanding what they're looking for.\"\n\nThis sort of experimentation has led Zuckerberg to some unexpected places.\n\"When we were originally thinking about formally building a dating service for\nFacebook, I signed up for all the dating services.\" he told me. \"I was showing\nPriscilla (his wife) one of the apps. It was an app where you got matched with\none person a day. I was like, 'Here's this app.' And she said, 'Hey, I'm\nhaving dinner with her tomorrow night!'\" He matched with his wife's friend. No\nword on how that dinner went.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSayman confirmed Zuckerberg was a willing Snapchat student. \"He'd send snaps\nwith me and I would critique him on his snaps,\" Sayman said. \"I'd be like 'No,\nMark. That's not how this works!'\"\n\nEventually, the groundswell of support for Stories inside Facebook --\ngenerated by Sayman and others -- got through to Zuckerberg. And in August\n2016, Facebook's executives called reporters into their offices to reveal a\nnew product they called Instagram Stories. The product was a carbon copy of\nSnapchat Stories, lifting everything including the name.\"They deserve all the\ncredit,\" then-Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom told TechCrunch, nodding to Spiegel\nand his team.\n\n _Always Day One_ by **Alex Kantrowitz**\n\nCopying Stories was ruthless. It slowed Snapchat's growth considerably, and\nlikely destroyed billions of dollars of value in its parent company, Snap\nInc., which is trading below its IPO price as of this writing. Snap,\nfrustrated and weakened, is now speaking with FTC's antitrust investigators\nabout Facebook's anti-competitive tactics, relying on a dossier it's built up\ncalled \"Project Voldemort,\" a reference to the villain in Harry Potter.\n\nEvil villain or not, Facebook would've been in serious trouble without\nStories, which has helped it recapture the friends and family sharing it was\nlosing a few years ago, and restore the vibrancy to its app. Facebook is still\nlosing teen users in the US by about 3% each year, according to eMarketer. But\nwithout Stories, and a renewed focus on messaging (another form of intimate\nsharing), it could've been in a much worse position. Copying was a move of\nself-preservation.\n\nSayman credited Facebook's ability to stay relevant with an internal awareness\nof its place in is the world. \"Facebook is just an internet app. Especially in\n2015 and 2016, it was just an internet app. Any other app could come about and\nbeat it,\" he said. \"Mark was like, What do people want? Let's just give it to\nthem. He was a bit more cautious. He was more vigilant. He was definitely not\nthinking his product was eternal.\"\n\nIn China, where copying and iterating on products has long been the norm,\nFacebook is known as \"the most Chinese company in Silicon Valley,\" according\nto Chinese venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, who wrote about this in his book, AI\nSuperpowers. I sat down with Lee on one of his periodic visits to the Bay\nArea, and asked him to share his feelings about Zuckerberg. \"Why do we\nstigmatize copying?\" Lee said. \"Don't we learn everything from copying first?\nDon't we learn music by copying Mozart and Beethoven? Don't we learn art by\ncopying whichever style that is taught? Through copying, you understand the\nessence of what you're building, then you can innovate and build. It would\nseem copying is a reasonable way to get started.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Facebook copied Stories, it's iterated on it and improved it.\nAnd now, its version is widely considered better than Snapchat's. Some of\nFacebook's improvements have been so good that Snapchat has even copied them\nback.\n\nThe graveyard of dead social networks is littered with the corpses of\ncompanies that were once unstoppable but were ultimately done in by pride or\nan inability to invent. MySpace, Livejournal, Foursquare, Friendster, and\nTumblr are among them. Facebook, meanwhile, has reinvented repeatedly and\nremains on top, in large part due to its feedback culture.\n\n\"Obviously, we'd rather be genius and invent first,\" Lee told me. \"But if you\ncan't, then copy first and then iterate.\"\n\n _Excerpted from_ Always Day One: How the Tech Titans Plan to Stay on Top\nForever _._  \n_Copyright (C) 2019 by Alex Kantrowitz, courtesy of Portfolio/Penguin._\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n **Technology Newsletter**\n\nSign Up\n\nReceive special Fast Company offers.\n\n[See All Newsletters](//www.fastcompany.com/newsletters)\n\n## [Video](//fastcompany.com/videos)\n\n### [Impact](/impact)\n\n[Impact\n\n## Immigrant social network Homeis is providing COVID-19 help to communities\nwith nowhere else to turn\n\n](/90486432/immigrant-social-network-homeis-is-providing-covid-19-help-to-\ncommunities-with-nowhere-else-to-turn \"Immigrant social network Homeis is\nproviding COVID-19 help to communities with nowhere else to turn\")[Impact\n\n## These pop-up hospital rooms are designed to help increase the capacity to\ntreat coronavirus patients\n\n](/90486733/these-pop-up-hospital-rooms-are-designed-to-help-increase-the-\ncapacity-to-treat-coronavirus-patients \"These pop-up hospital rooms are\ndesigned to help increase the capacity to treat coronavirus patients\")[Impact\n\n## What\u2019s the most ethical way to get grocery delivery?\n\n](/90486800/whats-the-most-ethical-way-to-get-grocery-delivery \"What\u2019s the\nmost ethical way to get grocery delivery?\")\n\n### [Creativity](/creativity)\n\n[Creativity\n\n## How Steak-Umm\u2014yes, that Steak-Umm\u2014became a voice of reason in the pandemic\n\n](/90487288/how-steak-umm-yes-that-steak-umm-became-a-voice-of-reason-in-the-\npandemic \"How Steak-Umm\u2014yes, that Steak-Umm\u2014became a voice of reason in the\npandemic\")[Creativity\n\n## These clever movie posters imagine Hollywood\u2019s A-list as your favorite\nbrand mascots\n\n](/90487302/these-clever-movie-posters-imagine-hollywoods-a-list-as-your-\nfavorite-brand-mascots \"These clever movie posters imagine Hollywood\u2019s A-list\nas your favorite brand mascots\")[Creativity\n\n## This travel videographer found a creative way to go skiing while\nquarantined\n\n](/90487341/this-travel-videographer-found-a-creative-way-to-go-skiing-while-\nquarantined \"This travel videographer found a creative way to go skiing while\nquarantined\")\n\n### [Co.Design](/co-design)\n\n[Co.Design\n\n## Will your cotton mask prevent coronavirus spread?

intelligence, genuine results: Technology in recruitment\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### _Technology has fast become a buzzword for HR, posing challenges yet\ncreating opportunities._ Priya Sunil _speaks to recruitment leaders across a\nrange of organisations to uncover real-time cases of how AI, machine learning\nand other tech platforms are disrupting talent acquisition._\n\nJust over a decade ago, recruiters spent hours on end flipping through stacks\nof resumes, paid hundreds of dollars to post a print ad in the local\nnewspaper, and even had to squeeze in multiple interview sessions with tens of\ncandidates to find suitable hires.\n\nFast-forward to today, and (almost) gone are the stacks of papers \u2013 recruiters\nare virtually flipping through resumes online instead. They no longer have to\nfight for ad space in the papers because they are posting job openings online\nand reaching a wider mass.\n\nEmployers are also tapping on artificial intelligence, online job portals and\nsocial media to facilitate a shorter and smarter recruitment process.\n\nIn this feature, we speak to recruitment leaders across Singapore and Malaysia\n\u2013 DBS, PwC Malaysia, Tele-centre Services, Credit Suisse, and Global HR\nConsultant Cordero Davis \u2013 on how they have harnessed technology in talent\nacquisition, the bumps and learning along the way, and their outlook for 2019.\n\n### How companies are leveraging technology: The game changer\n\nIn June 2018, Asia-born financial services group DBS became a Southeast Asian\npioneer by introducing a virtual bank recruiter called Jobs Intelligence\nMaestro, JIM for short.  \nThe brainchild of Singapore start-up Impress.AI and DBS\u2019 talent acquisition\nteam, JIM, powered by AI, was built with a view to increase the efficiency of\nhiring wealth planning managers.\n\nAccording to **James Loo, Head of Talent Acquisition Group, Group Human\nResources at DBS Bank** , pre-screening processes such as reviewing resumes,\ncollecting applicants\u2019 responses and conducting psychometric assessments are\nnow automated thanks to JIM.\n\nAside from JIM, DBS also leverages data analytics to hire high performers and\nreduce attrition rates, a concept agreed upon by **Global HR Consultant\nCordero Davis**. For Davis, it is important to track accurate data and\nleverage analytics to create the best internal and external recruitment\nexperiences.\n\n\u201cAI allows me to successfully influence positive recruitment changes with data\nand create effective interviewer training to successfully hire the best talent\nfor each role,\u201d he says.\n\nAcross the straits, professional services provider PwC Malaysia has developed\nonline applications for candidates that allow its recruiters, based in Kuala\nLumpur, to recruit remotely. In fact, for a new team of trainee associates,\nthere was only one trip required, when its recruiters were physically present\non-site to conduct the interview session. The consulting firm backs this up by\nharnessing the power of social media (Facebook ads, Twitter, LinkedIn), online\ncollaborative tools, online forms and e-newsletters.\n\n> ##### AI allows me to successfully influence positive recruitment changes\n> with data and create effective interviewer training to successfully hire the\n> best talent for each role.\n\n###### _- Cordero Davis, Global HR Consultant_\n\nSimilarly, **Aldrina Thirunagaran, Vice President, Human Resources, Virtual\nRecruitment Lead APAC** at financial services firm Credit Suisse, champions\nnew channels, technology platforms and partnerships as integral components of\nthe firm\u2019s virtual recruitment strategy to expand its reach to interns and\ngraduates globally.\n\nMeanwhile, a fuss-free and straightforward process is employed by **Madhavan\nCharles, Talent Acquisition Manager at customer service provider Tele-centre\nServices** , wherein the firm posts ads on several job portals such as Jobs\nBank and JobStreet, as well as on social platforms such as Facebook and\nLinkedIn.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [The top 3 hiring trends for HR professionals in\n2019](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-top-3-hiring-trends-for-hr-\nprofessionals-in-2019/)\n\n### The benefits: Increased efficiency\n\nThere is no doubt technology can take the weight off the shoulders of\nrecruiters. For example, a [2018 CareerBuilder\nsurvey](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-08-09-More-\nThan-Half-of-Employers-Have-Found-Content-on-Social-Media-That-Caused-Them-\nNOT-to-Hire-a-Candidate-According-to-Recent-CareerBuilder-\nSurvey&sa=D&ust=1550463791746000&usg=AFQjCNHaIqFtvBVF25-dX530Hv9C8ilqSA)\nrevealed 37% of employers who used social networks to source candidates found\nuseful information that supported their qualifications for the job, thus\nleading to better hires.\n\nAmong our interviewees, PwC Malaysia has been able to reap multiple benefits\nfrom virtual recruiting \u2013 primarily, recruiters being able to work and access\nthe information they need from anywhere and at anytime. This not only gives\nthem flexibility in a job that traditionally had them bound to a desk all day\nand shifting through hard-copy applications, but also allows them to integrate\nwork and life seamlessly, especially for those raising families.\n\n\u201cOne of our recruiters even had a flexible work arrangement where she came for\nhalf a day, four times a week. Despite her reduced office hours, she was still\nable to fulfil her responsibilities,\u201d says **Nor Sherriza, Lead, Employer\nBranding & Talent Acquisition at PwC Malaysia**.\n\nAdditionally, going virtual helps the firm track the high volume of\napplications, while maintaining the digital history/ footprint for each\napplicant. \u201cEven if the recruiter has changed over time, the database remains\nand the current recruiter is able to view the applicant\u2019s history and make an\ninformed decision,\u201d she says.\n\nOver at DBS, JIM\u2019s ability to automate aspects of the process has saved the\nteam around 40 man-hours a month, enabling recruiters to spend more time\nfocusing on talent advisory and upskilling themselves. Loo adds: \u201cAt the same\ntime, candidates benefit from having access to a virtual recruiter 24/7 and a\nfaster and more streamlined process.\u201d\n\nWhile talking numbers, Davis says with the help of automation and chatbots\nsuch as Mya, technology has benefited companies by increasing hiring\nproductivity by 75%. \u201cThis allows recruiters to focus the rest of their time\non building impactful candidate relationships, align with hiring managers, and\nattractive employer branding,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd on Credit Suisse\u2019s side, Thirunagaran says: \u201cUsing content and digital\nmarketing to further strengthen our employer brand and value proposition\nensures we are able to find the right candidates for the opportunities\navailable.\u201d\n\nCharles adds, in terms of being able to find the right candidates through\ntechnology: \u201cThough our hiring policy is strictly to consider Singaporeans as\nour first priority, but with Skype, the company is opened up to opportunities\nto interview foreign talent in the case the local pool lacks certain skill\nsets required for the role.\u201d\n\n**ALSO READ:** [The recruiter\u2019s guide: Executing a digital content\nstrategy](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-recruiters-guide-executing-\na-digital-content-strategy/)\n\n### Overcoming the challenges: A friend or foe?\n\nAs efficient as technology has been in recruiting, it has brought along its\nown set of challenges \u2013 the first of which is the missing link to a human\nelement, a point agreed upon by three of our interviewees.\n\nFor example, when DBS first tested JIM with a small group of candidates, the\nbot\u2019s persona was deemed \u201ctoo static and cold\u201d. However, as Loo aptly puts it:\n\u201cChallenges can be viewed as opportunities, and with each roadblock, we viewed\nthis as a chance to improve our product.\u201d\n\nFollowing the test feedback, his team was able to quickly change the persona\nto one that was more professional and warm. He adds: \u201cOur biggest learning\nwith JIM is to always get feedback and to iterate quickly.\u201d Sherriza and Davis\nalso mention the point around the human touch. From Sherriza\u2019s point of view,\nthis is \u201coften seen as cold, mechanical, and to some point, heartless.\u201d\n\nTo overcome this, her team makes it a point to call shortlisted applicants for\na chat. She adds: \u201cThis helps us make a sincere human connection while giving\nus the opportunity to understand each individual and brief them about the role\nand recruitment process.\u201d\n\nOn Davis\u2019 end, he says: \u201cWhen sending a test or a challenge to technical\ncandidates, there is no way a recruiter can tell if the candidate actually\ntook the test themselves. In some cases, recruiters may have to spend extra\ntime to have a more thorough pre-screening to recommend the best talent to\nhiring managers.\u201d\n\n> ##### \u201cChallenges can be viewed as opportunities, and with each roadblock,\n> we viewed this as a chance to improve our product.\u201d\n\n###### _- James Loo, DBS Bank_\n\nIn line with this, a [2019 trends prediction by Korn\nFerry](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/10-emerging-global-talent-trends-\nfor-2019/) revealed that despite AI\u2019s beneficial qualities, care must be taken\nthat using AI doesn\u2019t undermine efforts to boost diversity.\n\nFor example, even when resumes are anonymised, AI can still embed gender\nbiases. To address this, recruiters should feed the AI with non-partial data\nthat highlights success factors. This way, AI can be trained to look for\nskills needed rather than subjective modifiers that may be biased. Finally,\nwhile the usage of online job portals has allowed companies to post ads for\nvacant job roles and make the application process straightforward, it has also\nresulted in a number of applicants taking it for granted.\n\nSherriza explains: \u201cWe end up having less-than-genuine applicants who are\nmerely \u2018trying their luck\u2019 and \u2018seeing where it goes\u2019. Such applicants tend to\nnot show up for their interview or contribute to the high-decline rate as many\neventually realise they weren\u2019t truly interested.\u201d\n\nHow do we tackle this? Provide applicants with an online assessment.\n\u201cApplicants who aren\u2019t genuinely interested think twice about going through\nthe effort of answering a test and will tend to drop out thus saving our\nrecruiters time and effort,\u201d she adds.\n\nFrom these interviews, it is clear technology has played a huge role in\nevolving recruitment \u2013 and it will continue doing so. It is, however,\nimportant recruiters remain mindful of maintaining a balance between the\ntechnological aspect with a human touch. \u201cAlthough technology helps us achieve\nrapid hiring goals, the human-like recruitment experience cannot be fully\nreplaced by technology and that\u2019s the fear we tackle while growing companies\nat scale,\u201d Davis concludes.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Wishlist: Making the most of technology in 2019**\n\n**Madhavan Charles, Tele-centre Services:** \u201cI am looking forward to the\ndevelopment of our company website to have applicants apply on our website as\nwell as the addition of a chatbot. We have had some trials and things are\nlooking positive.\u201d\n\n**Nor Sherriza, PwC Malaysia:** \u201cWe wish to capitalise on AI to run\nassessments that use gamification, for example, which makes it less daunting\nfor the candidates as they don\u2019t feel like they are being \u2018tested\u2019 and equally\nless daunting for the recruiters as the results can be assessed immediately.\u201d\n\n**James Loo, DBS Bank:** \u201cWe will continue to leverage AI and machine learning\nto improve our recruitment processes. JIM will also be available in our other\ncore markets \u2013 Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India \u2013 for wealth\nplanning manager roles.\u201d\n\n**Aldrina Thirunagaran, Credit Suisse:** \u201cI believe this goes beyond the\ntechnology and ultimately boils down to partnerships, within the industry and\nbeyond. Collaboration is a big part of Credit Suisse\u2019s DNA and it is also key\nto creating unique business propositions while driving value.\u201d\n\n**Cordero Davis, Global HR Consultant:** \u201cIn 2019, I plan to take full\nadvantage of utilising recruitment technology while combining the human side\nof recruiting to create impactful and unique candidate experiences to attract\na more diverse talent pool.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**ALSO READ:**[Best recruitment process outsourcing partners in Singapore and\nMalaysia](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/best-recruitment-\nprocess-outsourcing-partners-in-singapore-and-malaysia/)\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com)_\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![talent-management-feature-image-istock](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/12/12104223/HRSG-Oct-talent-management-feature-image-\nistock-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[From 0 to 100: Managing the employee life\ncycle](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/features/from-0-to-100-managing-\nthe-employee-life-cycle/)\n\n![LIXIL-QA](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/04112850/LIXIL-QA-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[Q&A;: Angie Ng, Chief Human Resources Officer, Asia Pacific,\nLIXIL](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/features/qa-angie-ng-chief-human-\nresources-officer-asia-pacific-lixil/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n09/12/2018 Wed 09:32 AM in Hong Kong by [Samantha\nChan](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/samanthac/ \"Posts by\nSamantha Chan\")\n\n##\n[\u4eba\u529b\u8cc7\u6e90\u8077\u4f4d\u8b8a\u52d5\u2014\u2014\u6d32\u969b\u9152\u5e97\u3001\u548c\u8a18\u6e2f\u53e3\u3001Randstad\u7b49](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/%e4%ba%ba%e5%8a%9b%e8%b3%87%e6%ba%90%e8%81%b7%e4%bd%8d%e8%ae%8a%e5%8b%95-%e6%b4%b2%e9%9a%9b%e9%85%92%e5%ba%97%e3%80%81%e5%92%8c%e8%a8%98%e6%b8%af%e5%8f%a3%e3%80%81randstad%e7%ad%89/\n\"\u4eba\u529b\u8cc7\u6e90\u8077\u4f4d\u8b8a\u52d5\u2014\u2014\u6d32\u969b\u9152\u5e97\u3001\u548c\u8a18\u6e2f\u53e3\u3001Randstad\u7b49\")\n\n\u4eba\u529b\u8cc7\u6e90\u696d\u754c\u4eba\u4e8b\u52d5\u5411\u2014\u2014\u6b63\u901a\u6c7d\u8eca\u3001Esquel Enterprise\u3001Manpower\u7b49\u3002..\n\n07/30/2019 Tue 09:48 AM in All markets by\n[Contributor](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/contributor/ \"Posts\nby Contributor\")\n\n## [How data can match HR with the best external\nrecruiters](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/how-data-can-match-hr-with-\nthe-best-external-recruiters/ \"How data can match HR with the best external\nrecruiters\")\n\nHR also needs to be agile.

its\n\"rapidly growing\" wealth management business.\n\nThe move will also help it save up to 40 man-hours per month, DBS said on\nThursday.\n\nIn pilot since April, the virtual recruiter, Jim, has helped to review\nresumes, collect responses to pre-screening questions, and conduct\npsychometric profiling assessments on candidates.\n\nMr James Loo, the bank's head of Talent Acquisition Group, Group Human\nResources, said: \"Our candidates are often busy during the day, and many of\nour recruiters end up working long hours to cater to their schedules. A\nvirtual recruiter, such as Jim, would lighten our employees' workload... this\nfrees up our recruiters' time so they can take on higher-value work.\"\n\nJim is an acronym for Jobs Intelligence Maestro, and was created by Singapore\nstart-up Impress.AI and the DBS Talent Acquisition team. It is powered by\nartificial intelligence and will \"learn to make better assessments in\nscreening candidates\" over time, DBS said.\n\nOver the next few months, Jim will be available in DBS' core markets - Hong\nKong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India - for wealth planning manager roles.\nIt will also be made available for other roles such as the management\nassociate and graduate associate programmes, which see more than 7,000\ncandidates vying for 20 positions.\n\nDBS is not the only bank looking to automate more processes.\n\n> EASING WORKLOAD\n>\n> **Our candidates are often busy during the day, and many of our recruiters\n> end up working long hours to cater to their schedules. A virtual recruiter,\n> such as Jim, would lighten our employees' workload...**\n>\n> MR JAMES LOO, DBS' head of Talent Acquisition Group, Group Human Resources.\n\nEarlier this week, a Financial Times report said Citigroup's investment bank\ncould shed up to half of its 20,000 technology and operations staff in the\nnext five years, as \"machines supplant humans at a faster pace\".\n\nLast November, United Overseas Bank announced it was employing two robot-like\ncreations to cut the time taken to perform repetitive and time-consuming jobs\nsuch as data processing. The robots, named Amy and Eve, were assigned to teams\nsupporting the wholesale banking and retail businesses.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non June 16, 2018, with the headline 'Meet Jim, DBS' virtual recruiter'.

Why then is Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd missing out on some of\nthe region's hottest deals in digital banking?\n\nIn recent years, technology has played a large role in the bank's profitable\npivot away from trade financing to corporate cash management. One of its\napplication programming interfaces that hooks up with customers' software - it\nhas some 500 of them - allows merchants on Indonesian e-retailer PT\nBukalapak.com to get paid in real time. The same technology allows drivers at\nride-hailing company Gojek to get fares credited from their app wallets into\nbank accounts. But though DBS is the most aggressive of Singapore's three\nhomegrown banks, bigger international rivals are capturing prime deals in its\nbackyard. The No 1 challenger is Citigroup.\n\nThis week, the US bank won the mandate to issue the first co-branded credit\ncard for South-east Asian e-commerce. Alibaba Group Holding's Lazada operates\nonline stores in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and\nVietnam. Back in June, ride-share behemoth Grab Holdings announced a similar\ncard partnership. That, too, was snagged by Citi.\n\nThis matters intensely. The Internet economy in South-east Asia, a region of\nnearly 650 million people, is on track to exceed US$100 billion this year\nbefore tripling by 2025, according to research released Thursday by Alphabet\nInc's Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Co Financing. Online commerce, which\nsits at the intersection of consumer and transaction banking, has become a new\nbattleground. Tech companies want to deal with banks that can wrap their\ntraditional offering of cash management with services that are important to\nend-customers, such as simple user interfaces.\n\nIt isn't so much that DBS is slackening but that far bigger competitors are\nmoving onto its turf. The fact that Citi customers in Asia can pay for their\nSpotify subscriptions with card points made it into the US bank's annual\nreport. JPMorgan Chase & Co has invested US$40 billion on technology in four\nyears and is hawking new capabilities to Asian corporate clients.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group's foray into digital consumer banking may have been a\nmoney-losing proposition so far. But its credit card with Apple Inc shows that\nGoldman, too, will eventually come for a slice of South-east Asia's banking\nservices market. So will Japanese lenders, propelled by negative interest\nrates at home.\n\nDBS's lack of scale outside Singapore isn't for want of trying. In 2013,\nnationalist politics in Indonesia thwarted its US$6.5 billion acquisition of\nPT Bank Danamon, which eventually fell in the lap of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial\nGroup. Since then, DBS has acquired Australia and New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd's retail and wealth businesses in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and\nIndonesia. It's open to more such \"bolt-on\" acquisitions where it can overlay\nphysical assets with its digital strategy, CEO Piyush Gupta told Bloomberg TV\nlast month.\n\nMore is definitely needed. DBS has less than $24 billion in assets in South\nand South-east Asian markets - mainly comprising Indonesia, India and\nMalaysia's offshore financial centre at Labuan. It's a fraction of the bank's\nassets of $355 billion in Singapore and $90 billion in Hong Kong. Total income\nfrom South and South-east Asia was under $800 million last year, and after-tax\nprofit was just $1 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi's local regulatory filings suggest that about 28 per cent of\nits US$14.5 billion Asia revenue - or US$4 billion - came from South-east\nAsia, with Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the\nUS$500 million-plus annual revenue club. This is why I've previously argued\nthat any calls by dissident shareholders for Citi CEO Mike Corbat to ditch its\nAsian consumer banking business should be rejected. That balance sheet is\nimportant to the corporate and investment bank, and for bagging deals like\nleading the start-up Gojek's financing round.\n\n![Impress.AI chief executive officer and co-founder Sudhanshu Ahuja \\(second\nfrom left\\) with DBS staff, including Mr Bidyut Dumra \\(second from right\\),\nthe bank\u2019s head of Innovation.

South-east Asia's larger economies aren't\nimmune to a global slowdown, but they're weathering it relatively better than\nChina and India. The rise of consumer tech is where the opportunity lies. Even\nlocal lenders like Indonesia's Bank Central Asia Tbk are doing online-payment\npartnership deals, such as with shopping app Shopee.\n\nAt the annual DBS investor day two years ago, analysts were pleasantly\nsurprised to learn from chief financial officer Chng Sok Hui that consumer and\nsmall-enterprise banking in Singapore and Hong Kong - 44 per cent of the\nlender's business - was already three-fifths digital. The expectation was that\nonline prowess would give DBS an edge in its neighbourhood. It isn't panning\nout that well.\n\nTo make the most of its digital promise, DBS needs to bulk up in South-east\nAsia. The outcome isn't entirely in its hands. One test will be whether\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo's recent promise to further open up the\neconomy will make Singaporean banks more welcome. Whether South-east Asia\nmoves towards becoming a single economic area treating financial institutions\nthe same across borders will also matter. Ultimately, politics will determine\nwho gets to profit from financing the region's coming US$300 billion Internet\neconomy.\n\n_Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies\nand financial services._\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [DBS](/tags/dbs)\n  * [FINTECH](/tags/fintech)\n  * [COMMENTARY](/tags/commentary)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=10/04/2019&title=DBS must\nbulk up or lose fintech turf in South-east Asia)\n\nPermalink: https://str.sg/JJVg Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=10/04/2019&title=DBS must\nbulk up or lose fintech turf in South-east Asia)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=10/04/2019&title=DBS\nmust bulk up or lose fintech turf in South-east Asia)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=dbs-must-bulk-up-or-lose-fintech-turf-in-south-east-\nasia)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

artificial intelligence\n(AI), data science, immersive media and the Internet of Things.\n\nUnlike a start-up accelerator, Startup Xchange will not invest in or run an\nintensive three-month programme to groom start-ups. Instead, the programme\nbrings in start-ups to co-create solutions with DBS and the bank's corporate\nand small and medium-sized enterprise clients.\n\nSince its pilot launch several months ago, Startup Xchange has matched 21\nstart-ups with DBS and its clients, resulting in the successful roll-out of 10\nemerging technology solutions, DBS said yesterday. A further 10 solutions are\nexpected to be launched over the next 12 months.\n\nStartup Xchange also allows start-ups to showcase the solutions they developed\nfor DBS and to name the bank as an anchor client when raising capital with\ninvestors.\n\nFor instance, Singapore-based AI start-up impress.ai has partnered DBS' human\nresources team to create JIM, a virtual bank recruiter. Following the\npartnership, impress.ai has raised US$1.2 million (S$1.7 million) and seen a\nfive-fold increase in monthly revenues, noted DBS. The start-up is now working\nwith 15 large enterprise customers, including AXA, NTUC Income and Singtel.\n\nMr Bidyut Dumra, head of DBS' innovation group, said Startup Xchange is a win-\nwin for both the bank and the start-up community.\n\n> HELPING START-UP ECOSYSTEM\n>\n> **Start-ups sometimes have the brightest minds to develop the most cutting-\n> edge technology solutions but they lack an anchor client and continuous\n> funding. Startup Xchange is great as it helps the ecosystem of start-ups,\n> DBS and its customers to commercialise emerging technology solutions to\n> quickly achieve shared business goals. ''**\n>\n> MR BIDYUT DUMRA, head of DBS Bank's innovation group, calling Startup\n> Xchange a win-win for DBS and the start-up community.\n\n\"Start-ups sometimes have the brightest minds to develop the most cutting-edge\ntechnology solutions but they lack an anchor client and continuous funding.\n\n\"Startup Xchange is great as it helps the ecosystem of start-ups, DBS and its\ncustomers to commercialise emerging technology solutions to quickly achieve\nshared business goals,\" he added.\n\nDBS has launched the Startup Xchange programme in its two largest markets,\nSingapore and Hong Kong. It said the programme is part of a five-year, $10\nmillion investment to support the development of start-ups.\n\nDBS said its research found that 78 per cent of accelerators launched in\nSingapore over the past three years are now defunct as many start-ups had\nfailed without continued support from established sponsors and partners.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non October 31, 2018, with the headline 'New scheme matches DBS and clients\nwith tech start-ups'.

A startup failing is not news; most such businesses fail.\nStill, when co-founder Stefan Seltz-Axmacher took to[\nMedium](https://medium.com/starsky-robotics-blog/the-end-of-starsky-robotics-\nacb8a6a8a5f5) last Thursday to[ announce the\nclosure](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/starsky-robotics-ends-remote-truck-\nexperiment-shuts-down-operations), he dove into great detail on what happened,\nand where he sees the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nHere\u2019s the highlight: If you\u2019re not on the autonomous vehicle bandwagon yet,\nyou have plenty of time.\n\n\u201cFrom my vantage point, I think the most likely line of human equivalence is\nL3 [autonomy] which means that no one should be betting a business on safe AI\n(artificial intelligence) decision makers,\u201d Seltz-Axmacher wrote. \u201cThe current\ncompanies who are will continue to drain momentum over the next two years,\nfollowed by a few years with nearly no investment in the space, and\n[hopefully] another unmanned highway test [in] five years.\u201d\n\nSeltz-Axmacher went through the issues Starsky had but also some of the\nbroader issues facing autonomous vehicle development.\n\nStarsky was somewhat atypical in what it was building. The company focused on\nbuilding an autonomous system that allowed a truck to drive unoccupied on\nroadways, but it would always be monitored by a remote driver. That driver\nwould use video cameras and vehicle controls such as a steering wheel to take\ncontrol of the truck as needed. The driver would also drive the vehicle from\nthe control room during the last mile of deliveries, similar to a video game.\nThat means that while there would be no physical driver in the vehicle, a\ndriver would remain in control.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Latest News:\n\n  * [Paycheck Protection Program may get $250 billion boost](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/paycheck-protection-program-may-get-250-billion-boost)\n  * [Commentary: Maintaining flow of goods essential during battle against COVID-19](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/commentary-maintaining-flow-of-goods-essential-during-battle-against-covid-19)\n  * [Lufthansa decommissions aircraft, predicts recovery will take years](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/lufthansa-decommissions-aircraft-predicts-recovery-will-take-years)\n  * [California regulators: Full steam ahead on trucking pollution programs](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/california-regulators-not-hitting-pause-button-on-emissions-regulations)\n  * [CargoMetrics data reveals resilience of ocean trade (so far)](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/cargometrics-data-reveals-resilience-of-ocean-trade-so-far)\n\n* * *\n\nBut, unlike autonomous startups like TuSimple, Ike, Plus.ai and Waymo, Starsky\nwas never able to attract the big funding necessary to develop the technology.\nSeltz-Axmacher acknowledged that the Starsky team didn\u2019t understand what\nventure capitalists (VCs) were looking for in an autonomous investment.\n\n\u201cIt took me way too long to realize that VCs would rather [invest in] a $1B\nbusiness with a 90% margin than a $5B business with a 50% margin, even if\ncapital requirements and growth were the same,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCrunchbase data shows that\n[TuSimple](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/startups/tusimple-funding-round)\nhas raised around $298 million in the past six rounds of funding and self-\ndriving startup Plus.ai has raised around $200 million in its past three\nrounds of funding.[ Ike](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ike-robotics-\nreleases-safety-self-assessment) has raised $52 million in Series A funding,\nand Embark, Waymo and others have been able to attract significant funding as\nwell. Starsky attracted just $20.3 million in funding in its three years.\n\n* * *\n\n> \u201cIt took me way too long to realize that VCs would rather [invest in] a $1B\n> business with a 90% margin than a $5B business with a 50% margin, even if\n> capital requirements and growth were the same.\u201d\n>\n> Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky Robotics co-founder\n\n* * *\n\nSeltz-Axmacher wrote that plenty of brokers are willing to place freight on\nautonomous vehicles, but what limits the opportunity is the safety aspect.\n\n\u201cIn January of 2019, our head of safety, our head of PR, and I gathered in a\nconference room for a strategy session. The issue: how could we make safety\nseem exciting enough to cover,\u201d Seltz-Axmacher wrote. \u201cA month earlier we had\npublicly released our VSSA [voluntary safety self-assessment], a highly\ntechnical document that detailed how we decided to approach safety. We had\npitched it to a particularly smart reporter, but instead of covering it in\ndetail, they mostly wrote about teleoperation. We left the meeting in a\nfluster \u2014 we couldn\u2019t figure out how to make safety engineering sexy enough to\ngarner its own reporting.\n\n\u201cAnd we never really figured out how,\u201d he added.\n\nStarsky worked hard at documenting and fixing system failures, Seltz-Axmacher\nnoted, but he said investors don\u2019t see, or value, that work.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that all of that work is invisible. Investors expect founders\nto lie to them \u2014 so how are they to believe that the unmanned run we did\nactually only had a one in a million chance of [a fatal] accident? If they\ndon\u2019t know how hard it is to do unmanned, how do they know someone else can\u2019t\ndo it next week?\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhat did get investors\u2019 attention were competitors who invested in AI\nfeatures.\n\n\u201cDecision makers which could sometimes decide to change lanes or could drive\non surface streets (assuming they had sufficient map data). Really neat,\ncutting-edge stuff,\u201d Seltz-Axmacher said. \u201cInvestors were impressed. It didn\u2019t\nmatter that that jump from \u2018sometimes working\u2019 to statistically reliable was\n10\u20131000x more work.\u201d\n\nHe said Starsky believed it didn\u2019t need \u201ctrue AI\u201d to be a good business; in\nfact, Seltz-Axmacher believed Starsky could succeed developing the technology\nand then serving as the operator of the vehicles. Investors disagreed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the public stock offerings of WeWork, Uber and Lyft failed\nto impress and soured investors on technology companies.\n\n* * *\n\n> \u201cIf we showed anything at Starsky, it\u2019s that this is buildable if you\n> religiously focus on getting the person out of the vehicle in limited-use\n> cases. But it will need to be someone else to realize that vision.\"\n>\n> Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky Robotics co-founder\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when investors cool on a space, they generally cool on the\nentire space,\u201d Seltz-Axmacher wrote. \u201cWe also saw that investors really didn\u2019t\nlike the business model of being the operator, and that our heavy investment\ninto safety didn\u2019t translate for investors.\u201d\n\nSeltz-Axmacher said that if Level 3 autonomy is the equivalent of human\ndrivers, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely any of the current technology will make that jump.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever someone says autonomy is 10 years away that\u2019s almost certainly what\ntheir thought is,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his conclusion, Seltz-Axmacher remained optimistic his dream would come\ntrue.\n\n\u201cIf we showed anything at Starsky, it\u2019s that this is buildable if you\nreligiously focus on getting the person out of the vehicle in limited-use\ncases.

Great insight on some\nof the driverless truck lies we've all been told.\n\nWe will probably see more of these autonomous vehicle startups fail. There are\njust way too many unsolvable problems.\n\nMaybe we will see an economic solution for this in 30 to 50 years or longer.\nBut most of us will be retired or dead.

Could this be the tipping point for digital health,\nespecially for such recent innovations as telehealth, which allows us to\nconsult directly with health care providers via computer or mobile device?\n\nWith social distancing and shelter-in-place now all too familiar concepts,\ntelehealth offerings could well be effective tools in managing the impact of\nthe virus. They can aid in preventing infected patients and people with other\nhealth issues from congregating and possibly contracting or passing on the\nvirus.\n\nSignificantly, telehealth has never been more widely available, if\nunderutilized. Recent U.S. findings from [the National Survey of Employer-\nSponsored Health Plans](https://www.mercer.us/what-we-do/health-and-\nbenefits/strategy-and-transformation/mercer-national-survey-benefit-\ntrends.html) show that while telehealth is a ubiquitous offering among\nemployers, utilization rates remain low, growing slowly from 8% in 2018 to 9%\nin 2019.\n\nThat is very likely to change, now that the coronavirus pandemic is a primary\nfocus of societal and business concern. Importantly, telemedicine might be\ninvaluable for behavioral health \u2014 especially if people are quarantined for\nmany weeks and anxiety and depression mount.\n\nIs this a new era of telemedicine and virtual mental health counseling, along\nwith smart apps and sensors to track medications, AI to diagnose medical\nconditions or augmented reality to assist with pain and stress management?\nWhat role do employers play in providing digital health solutions? What do\nworkers want, need and expect? And how can digital health offerings help\nemployers to attract talent and achieve better health outcomes for their\npeople?\n\nTo explore these questions, Mercer Marsh Benefits, Mercer and Oliver Wyman\nconducted [a study](https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/health/mercer-marsh-\nbenefits-health-on-demand.html#contactForm) that examines digital health\ninnovation and the future of health care in the context of employee attitudes\nand work cultures.\n\nFor enterprises, understanding what attracts workers to \u201chealth on demand\u201d \u2014\nand what worries them about it \u2014 can mean the difference between leaping ahead\nor lagging behind in building the energized workforce that will drive\nsustainable growth and bright futures. The study, which was completed in June\n2019, polled 16,564 workers and 1,300 senior decision-makers from seven mature\nmarkets (U.S., U.K., Canada, Italy, France, Netherlands and Singapore) and six\ngrowth markets (Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia and Mexico).\n\nAmong the key findings is the strong business case for digital health, which,\nwhile apparent last year, is even more compelling now. Employers responding to\nthe survey indicated that robust health and well-being programs \u2014 enhanced\nwith digital health solutions \u2014 are seen as key to attracting and maintaining\ntalent in a competitive labor market, and results suggested that corporate\ninvestment in workforce health would grow over the next five years.\n\nNow it seems that digital health solutions may also be important purely from a\nrisk-management perspective. They can help to protect against talent shortages\nand absenteeism due to infectious disease, sickness or injury that can leave\ncompanies without the people to get the job done.\n\n## Horizons of Digital Health\n\nOverall, 40% of employers believe that sponsoring or promoting digital health\nsolutions will aid in employee retention, while one-quarter of surveyed\nworkers say they are more likely to remain with an employer who offers digital\nsolutions. The 36% of employees who say it makes no difference may well change\ntheir tune as the coronavirus era affects working life. Health is a top-of-\nmind item for everyone right now; as a result, employees may be more engaged\nand more willing to change their health behaviors than they normally are. In\nthe U.S. alone, 68% of surveyed employers are likely to invest more in digital\nhealth in the next five years \u2014 and that number may be rising quickly in\ntoday\u2019s climate.\n\nBut the horizons of digital health include clouds of complexity that can\u2019t be\noverlooked. The Health on Demand research shows that workers are looking for\nimproved access to high-quality health care that is personal, convenient,\naffordable and secure \u2014 but they recognize the potential downsides. They have\nconcerns about risks associated with digital health care and AI, especially\ndata protection and privacy.\n\n> Amongst the coronavirus crisis, it is important for business leaders to look\n> beyond the moment at an empowered future of better health on demand.\n\nIt is important to recognize that while some employees will be more receptive\nthan others to digital health, very few are truly opposed to it. An analysis\nshows that workers can be divided into four distinct segments based upon their\nattitudes to health innovations, their confidence in health solutions\nsponsored by employers and their likelihood of staying with an employer\noffering these solutions. Call them the Sign Me Up, Impress Me, Get Me\nComfortable, and Not for Me segments.\n\nSign Me Up, for example, comprises 37% of U.S. workers and is dominated by\nmillennials, who are tech-savvy, more willing to try digital health\ninnovations and less likely to leave employers who offer them. The Impress Me\ncohort, at 19%, is educated yet not loyal; they are less likely to stay due to\ndigital health offerings yet more willing to try them \u2014 but not through their\nemployer.\n\nThe largest segment, at 40%, is the Get Me Comfortable group, who skew to\nGeneration X. While they are willing to try digital health solutions and are\nless likely to leave employers who offer them, they are less confident in\nemployer-sponsored solutions. But only 5% of U.S. workers, those in the Not\nfor Me category \u2014 who tend to be older, tech-skeptic employees \u2014 are truly\nunwilling to try digital health.\n\n## A Pro-Health Culture\n\nOverall, there is high demand for a pro-health culture. Investments in digital\nhealth tools can help demonstrate that employers value health and well-being.\nThis dovetails with the interests of workers, many of whom want their company\nto create healthy environments.\n\nIn addition, employers recognize that there are barriers to health that are\ntough to get around, like affordable housing and transportation. Practically\nspeaking, a low-income single parent with a two-hour commute has limited\noptions when it comes to caring for their health. Virtual solutions that\nsupport self-care or provide easy access to counseling have the potential to\naddress these social determinants.\n\nBut the survey revealed some gaps between employer and employee perspectives\nwhen it comes to creating a culture of health. A third of U.S. workers \u2014 but\njust over a quarter of employers \u2014 see the value of allowing workers time off\nto see health care professionals or get treatments.\n\nBy contrast, nearly half of employers favor incentives to get workers to\nregister for well-being programs, while fewer than three in 10 workers believe\nthis would help them become more engaged. Subsidized nutrition and exercise\nprograms and onsite medical clinics were in the workers\u2019 top-five initiatives\nfor promoting greater health engagement.\n\nGiven this practical focus, just 17% of workers would like to see a greater\npromotion of digital health resources, compared with nearly a third of\nemployers. Yet this could change in a time when working from home during a\npandemic becomes a new normal and employees grasp the value of digital\nsolutions in a way that has not fully emerged. This suggests that digital\nsolutions could be included as part of an integrated set of initiatives\ncomprehensive enough to address the diversity of worker needs.\n\nFrom all this, it\u2019s clear that digital health cannot be an end in itself. A\npro-health environment encompasses a range of options, but it is fair to say\nthat digital health and well-being solutions will be of increasing importance\nin retaining, engaging and energizing workers and will have a clear role in\nfacilitating personalized health care. When technology \u2014 designed around the\nend user \u2014 connects people to better care than they could get otherwise, that\nis the sweet spot of digital health.\n\nCompanies looking to include or expand digital solutions in their health\nofferings are starting from an encouraging position in which barriers to\nadoption are generally low and workers\u2019 trust in their employers is high.\n\nThe survey showed that workers are willing to share health data to receive\nhigher quality, more personalized and convenient care. Most of them trust\ntheir employers to keep their personal health information secure.\nResponsibility falls to employers in developing digital health ecosystems and\nin putting the right policies and practices in place to protect that trust.\n\nUltimately, a balance of care is required, and digital health is not a\npanacea. Health care providers can talk, text, chat, look at pictures of\nrashes and even listen to heartbeats virtually, but they can\u2019t inject a\nvaccine \u2014 or hold a hand \u2014 over WiFi. The coronavirus crisis may spark a new\nera for digital health, yet it is important for business leaders to look\nbeyond the moment at an empowered future of better health on demand.\n\n[Healthcare](https://www.brinknews.com/tag/healthcare/) [Internet of\nThings](https://www.brinknews.com/tag/internet-of-things/)\n\n![](https://www.brinknews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/beth-e1585152261734.jpg)\n\n# Beth Umland\n\nDirector of Research at Mercer US Health & Benefits\n\nBeth Umland is the director of research at Mercer US Health & Benefits.\n\n![](https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/lorna.jpg)\n\n# Dr. Lorna Friedman\n\nGlobal Health Leader, Multinational at Mercer\n\nDr. Lorna Friedman is the global health leader, multinational, at Mercer.\n\n![](https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kat-\nbrown-e1585152392843.jpg)\n\n# Kate Brown\n\nCenter for Health Innovation Leader at Mercer US Health & Benefits\n\nKate Brown is the center for health innovation leader at Mercer US Health &\nBenefits.\n\n# Stay Informed\n\n[New thinking on corporate risk and resilience in the global\neconomy.](/newsletter)\n\nFor optimal delivery time, please select your region:\n\nAsia/Middle East  Europe/Americas/Africa\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nSuccess!

On March 10th the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping,\nvisited Hubei\u2019s capital, Wuhan, for the first time since the lockdown. He\nspoke by videolink to patients at an army-run hospital there. He also visited\na residential area (see picture) to see how Wuhan\u2019s citizens\u2014most of whom are\nstill under orders to stay at home\u2014are coping with quarantine. Mr Xi said the\nspread of the virus had been \u201cbasically\u201d curbed.\n\nOfficial figures are certainly encouraging. On the day of Mr Xi\u2019s trip only 19\nconfirmed new infections were recorded in China, down from thousands at the\npeak of the outbreak in February. About three-quarters of the 80,000 or so\npeople known to have caught the virus in China are now said to have recovered\nfrom it. Officials in Wuhan have closed makeshift wards in public buildings\nsuch as sports centres and exhibition halls. Local governments in less-\naffected parts of Hubei say they are beginning to relax travel restrictions in\nthe hope that people can get back to work. China is now stressing the\nimportance of making sure that travellers from countries where infections are\nrising do not bring the pathogen with them. On March 11th city officials in\nBeijing said passengers flying into the capital\u2019s airports from abroad must\nspend 14 days in self-quarantine.\n\nChina\u2019s growing confidence in its struggle with the epidemic is evident in its\npropaganda. State media increasingly crow about the party\u2019s strengths in\nhandling the crisis. Their editorials marking Mr Xi\u2019s visit to Wuhan\nproclaimed the success of China\u2019s anti-virus measures, which have required\nhundreds of millions of people to submit to quarantine, and gave the credit to\nChina\u2019s political system. People who use the crisis to \u201csmear\u201d the country\u2019s\npolitics are \u201cimmoral and despicable\u201d said Xinhua, a state news agency. With\nthe virus now threatening to damage the health and livelihoods of people\nglobally, the party appears keener than ever to deflect criticism of its own\nbungling in the early days of the outbreak when news of its spread was\nsuppressed. On March 10th a Chinese magazine, _Renwu_ , published an interview\nwith Ai Fen, one of several doctors in Wuhan who are known to have been\nmuzzled by officials for discussing the virus online soon after its discovery.\nCensors quickly pulled the story from _Renwu_ \u2019s website.\n\nOrdinary Chinese are relieved by the sharp drop in daily numbers of confirmed\nnew infections. Many show remarkable tolerance for the lengthy quarantines\nthey have had to suffer. But there is much grumbling online about the\nbehaviour of some officials during the outbreak, and less full-throated praise\nfor the merits of one-party rule than officials would like to see. Tensions\nhave been particularly evident in Wuhan. In early March quarantined residents\nin one housing complex shouted down from their windows as Sun Chunlan, a\ndeputy prime minister, was being shown round. They warned her that officials\nin their neighbourhood were putting on a \u201cfake\u201d show of relief efforts in\norder to impress her. The hecklers explained that they were having problems\ngetting deliveries of groceries, among other difficulties. Videos of the\nincident spread online. Unusually, state media broadcast footage of the\nincident, perhaps to show that the authorities are heeding complaints. During\nhis trip to Wuhan, Mr Xi also made a rare nod to public anger. \u201cThe masses in\nHubei, Wuhan and other areas hard-hit by the epidemic have been in self-\nisolation for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have some emotions to vent. We must\nunderstand this and be tolerant and forgiving. We must continue to step up the\nintensity of our work in all aspects.\u201d\n\nMr Xi may have had in mind an eruption of emotion on March 6th, when Wuhan\u2019s\nrecently appointed party boss, Wang Zhonglin, told officials that a campaign\nof \u201cgratitude education\u201d was needed to make sure local people understood the\nimportant role that Mr Xi and the party had played in their deliverance. His\nwords, carried in local newspapers, provoked outrage on social media and were\nswiftly deleted from websites. The party chief of Hubei, Ying Yong, also newly\nappointed, made a statement clarifying that \u201cWuhan people are heroes\u201d and that\nhe was sincerely grateful to them. The party probably hopes that Mr Xi\u2019s visit\nwill help to assuage some of the public\u2019s anger.\n\nThere is plenty of it bubbling up online, and not always about the\ngovernment\u2019s handling of the epidemic. People have been fuming about\nofficials\u2019 lax controls over construction projects, after the collapse on\nMarch 8th of a hotel in the coastal province of Fujian that had been\nrequisitioned for use as a quarantine centre. Around 30 people died. The\nvictims were travellers who had returned from other parts of the country and\nwho were being kept in precautionary isolation for 14 days. Many people have\nalso been venting about a proposed regulation that would make it easier for\ncertain foreigners to gain permanent residency (see\n[article](/china/2020/03/12/a-proposal-to-help-a-few-foreigners-settle-in-\nchina-triggers-a-furore)).\n\nMr Xi may find it hard to choose his moment to declare complete success. As\npeople gradually get back to work, there is a risk that the virus may begin to\nspread more widely again in China. That may lead to renewed lockdowns. The\nparty appears to remain intent on treating the virus as something that can be\nconquered, rather than\u2014as some other governments are handling it\u2014something\nthat can only be hindered from spreading too rapidly.\n\nIn Wuhan, Mr Xi was careful not to sound triumphant. \u201cThrough arduous efforts,\nthere has been a positive turn for the better in epidemic containment in Hubei\nand Wuhan. Important interim results have been achieved,\u201d he said. But he also\nsaid there should be \u201cno slackening at all\u201d in anti-virus work. That will not\nbe music to the ears of people in Wuhan and many other parts of China where\ndraconian quarantine measures may have helped to curb the epidemic, but at no\nsmall cost, not least for firms and people in need of medical care unrelated\nto covid-19. \u25a0\n\n **Dig deeper:**\n\n  * For more coverage of covid-19 see our [coronavirus hub](/coronavirus)\n  * [The science of the virus ](/briefing/2020/03/12/understanding-sars-cov-2-and-the-drugs-that-might-lessen-its-power)\n  * [Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously ](/international/2020/03/12/fatality-rates-for-covid-19-could-vary-enormously)\n  * [How to deal with a new sort of financial shock](/leaders/2020/03/12/how-to-deal-with-a-new-sort-of-financial-shock)\n  * [Should other countries copy Italy\u2019s nationwide lockdown?](/international/2020/03/12/should-other-countries-copy-italys-nationwide-lockdown)\n\nThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the\nheadline \"A gesture to the sequestered\"\n\n[Reuse this\ncontent](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=China%20appears%20confident%20that%20its%20coronavirus%20epidemic%20has%20abated&publicationDate=2020-03-12&contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fnc48tj7cn6fup44dbknmrs7qb35mak79&type=A&orderBeanReset=TRUE)[The\nTrust Project](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n\n## More from China\n\n### [Chaguan  \nChina is also an idea, revealing much about Western hopes and\nfears](/china/2020/04/04/china-is-also-an-idea-revealing-much-about-western-\nhopes-and-fears)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_CND000_0.jpg)\n\n[China](/china/)\n\n### [Visible and vocal  \nDelivery apps have transformed urban life in\nChina](/china/2020/04/03/delivery-apps-have-transformed-urban-life-in-china)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200404_CNP002.jpg)\n\n[China](/china/)\n\n### [Portals to the afterlife  \nHow China\u2019s grave-sweeping festival is adapting to\ncovid-19](/china/2020/04/03/how-chinas-grave-sweeping-festival-is-adapting-to-\ncovid-19)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200404_blp902_facebook.jpg)\n\n[China](/china/)\n\n## The best of our journalism, handpicked each day\n\nSign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today\n\n[Sign up now](https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter)\n\n![A hand holding a newspaper](/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg)\n\n  * [Subscribe](https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/Footer)\n  * [Group subscriptions](https://groupsubscriptions.economist.com)\n  * [Help](https://www.economist.com/help/home)\n\n## Keep updated\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/theeconomist)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-economist)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/economistmagazine)\n  * [RSS](https://www.economist.com/rss)\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in _\u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d_\n\n## Apps & media\n\n  * [The Economist apps](https://www.economist.com/apps)\n  * [Economist Films](https://films.economist.com)\n  * [Podcasts](https://www.economist.com/blogs/podcasts)\n\n## Other publications\n\n  * [1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com)\n  * [The World in](https://theworldin.economist.com/)\n  * [The World If](https://www.economist.com/worldif18)\n\n## The Economist\n\n  * [About](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n  * [Advertise](http://marketingsolutions.economist.com)\n  * [Press centre](https://press.economist.com)\n\n## The Economist Group\n\n  * [Economist Group](https://www.economistgroup.com/)\n  * [The Economist Store](https://shop.economist.com)\n  * [Careers](https://economistgroupcareers.com)\n  * [Which MBA?](https://www.economist.com/whichmba)\n  * [GMAT Tutor](https://gmat.economist.com/)\n  * [GRE Tutor](https://gre.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Jobs](http://jobs.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Education Navigator](https://execed.economist.com)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.economist.com/legal/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/privacy)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html)\n  * [Manage Cookies](https://l3.evidon.com/site/2254/668/6?lang=en-gb)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.economist.com/help/accessibilitypolicy)\n  * [Modern Slavery Statement](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/guiding_principles.html)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](http://privacyportal.economist.com/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

the game of Go is\nusually estimated at 10172, more than the number of atoms in the universe. So\nwhen AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google, beat a Chinese master of\nthe game in 2017, it created an understandable frenzy of excitement over what\nartificial intelligence might achieve.\n\nThat excitement has since morphed into another type of frisson. Futurologists\nand consultants have begun to predict that when AI starts to transform our\ndaily lives, China will become the leading technological power.\n\n\"China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no\nother country is doing,\" said Abishur Prakash, a futurist who specializes in\nthe field.\n\nSuch statements have become almost an article of faith. But a deeper dive into\nthe context of China's headlong leap into AI reveals a more nuanced and often\nless impressive reality. The first place reality falls short of the hype is in\nthe realm of personnel.\n\nA lack of local talent runs right through China's AI sector, according to\nLance Noble of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. One cause of this\nshortage is that many of the experts who went abroad to study have chosen to\nremain there for employment, usually in the U.S.\n\nSo pronounced is this trend that the Paulson Institute, a U.S. think tank,\nfound that nine of the 10 Chinese-born researchers who in 2018 presented\npapers at the most selective AI conference were affiliated with U.S.\ninstitutions, with the 10th about to move to such an institution.\n\nPut another way, the U.S. skims off the best of China's AI experts. Indeed, of\nthe 18,232 registered AI specialists back in China, only 5.6% can be\nconsidered \"top tier,\" according to a\n[report](http://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/eWebEditor/UploadFile/Executive_susmmary_China_AI_Report_2018.pdf)\nfrom the China Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Tsinghua\nUniversity.\n\nOf course, given Beijing's ambition to lead the world in AI theory, technology\nand application by 2030, the authorities are seeking to close the talent gap.\nThe Ministry of Education approved 35 new AI programs at Chinese universities\nlast year.\n\nBut the gap exists not only at the top. The impact of a shortfall of AI\ntechnicians is acutely felt on China's factory floor. According to [this\ntranslation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7mcORR-6lABPzAdFl1m6Ow6fdZD-w1ZrmKPNKZHDjk/edit#)\nby Jeffrey Ding, author of the ChinAI newsletter, the country's talent\nshortage in various industry sectors runs to around 20 million people.\n\nTrained technicians able to operate computer numerical control machinery --\nthe programmed machines that perform complex manufacturing tasks -- are in\nsuch short supply that many factories are delaying the installation of\nupgraded equipment for fear of being unable to operate it.\n\nBut if shortages haunt the AI talent pool, oversupply plagues the bureaucratic\nresponse to China's AI ambitions. As is often the case when a directive is\ngiven top priority, agencies at all levels of China's pyramidal structure have\nswarmed to show their willingness.\n\nA bubble in local government funding for AI initiatives has emerged, with 21\nprovinces announcing plans to establish AI hubs. They are dangling subsidies\nand incentives meant to attract AI companies to set up shop in their\nindustrial parks.\n\nWhile the 2017 national plan to spur AI dominance aspired to create an\nindustry worth 150 billion yuan ($21.6 billion) in annual revenues by this\nyear, the various provincial and municipal targets -- when added together --\ncome to more than three times that figure, according to Noble of Gavekal\nDragonomics.\n\nThe feeding frenzy is having predictable results. As provinces and\nmunicipalities compete to impress Beijing, a number of local-level projects\nare duplicative in their aims and outputs. They also push up the wages for AI\nworkers, exacerbating the impact of skill shortages. And as authorities seek\nto foster local champions, they are erecting barriers to competition from\nother parts of the country, thus fragmenting the AI market.\n\nAt the apex of all this, there are other problems created by China's\noverweening bureaucracy. The Ministry of Science and Technology, which\noversees the national AI push, decided in 2018 to bring the National Natural\nScience Foundation -- which funds much basic research -- under its direct\ncontrol.\n\nThis has meant that bureaucrats, rather than scientists, are inserting\nthemselves into the selection of research projects. The result, insiders fear,\nwill be an emphasis on huge, eye-catching AI endeavors primarily intended to\nimpress superiors rather than further scientifically useful research.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Fmedium%2F4%2F6%2F3%2F9%2F20089364-3-eng-\nGB%2FJK%20high%20res%20photo%20%281%29%20%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC.jpg?source=nar-\ncms)\n\n _James Kynge is editor of Tech Scroll Asia, a newsletter on technology in\nAsia that combines the best reporting from Nikkei and the Financial Times.

Harnessing New Tech: Q&A With Head Of Innovation, Technology And Operations At DBS Bank Bidyut Dumra\n\n# Harnessing New Tech: Q&A With Head Of Innovation, Technology And Operations\nAt DBS Bank Bidyut Dumra\n\n## Advertisement\n\nBidyut Dumra, head of Innovation, Technology and Operations at DBS Bank, talks\nabout internal and external innovation.\n\nJune 05, 2019 Author: [Gilly Wright](/contributors/gilly-wright/)\n\n![](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/image/bidyut-\ndumra-1560197283.jpg)\n\n_**Global Finance: What drives innovation at DBS?**_\n\n**Bidyut Dumra:** The banking industry is being profoundly impacted by new\ntechnologies and changing customer expectations. Fintechs and nontraditional\nbanking players like Alibaba are attacking the financial services value chain.\nIn such an environment, our future success depends on our ability to innovate,\nharness the digital revolution and completely reimagine the role of banks and\nthe customer's experience.\n\nWe are thinking deeply about customers' true needs and how we can extend our\nreach into larger geographies without an extensive physical branch network.\nOver the past few years, DBS has been embracing various forms of digital\ntechnology--such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data\nanalytics--to improve the customer experience.\n\n_**GF: Is it better to partner with fintechs or better to develop expertise\nin-house?**_\n\n**Dumra:** For DBS, it's a blend of both. We have developed our own technology\nin-house, but we also see the value in partnering with fintechs and other tech\ncompanies.\n\nIf you look back 10, maybe 15 years ago, banks perceived fintechs as a threat.\nThat has changed. Fintechs also realized that the best way to ensure their\nsurvival is by working with banks. Fintechs are agile and nimble; they have\nthe ability to create new products and services quickly. But they lack the\ncustomer base, the financial knowledge, approvals from regulators and trust.\nBanks, on the other hand, work closely with regulators; and over the years,\nthey have gained the trust of customers.\n\nWith this in mind, we decided to think of new ways to partner with fintechs.\nWe launched our API platform, the world's largest financial-developer portal,\nin 2017, to boost our ability to create new customer-centric experiences. It\nenables us to collaborate better.\n\nWe also launched Startup Xchange last year, focused on four areas of frontier\ntechnologies, to help us stay relevant in the long run. Already, Startup\nXchange has successfully matched 21 startups with units within the bank as\nwell as the bank's SME clients to solve business pain points, resulting in the\nsuccessful rollout of 10 emerging tech solutions, with another 10 expected to\nlaunch in the next 12 months.\n\nStartup Xchange allows startups to showcase the solutions they developed for\nDBS and name the bank as an anchor client when raising capital. One example of\na successful Startup Xchange project is with impress.ai, a Singapore-based\nstartup and DBS SME client that partnered with DBS' HR team to create JIM,\nSoutheast Asia's first virtual bank recruiter.\n\n_**GF: What will the DBS of the future look like?**_\n\n**Dumra:** Banks of today look different from the banks of yesterday, so banks\nof tomorrow will look fundamentally different from banks of today. We believe\nthe future of banking is one in which the bank is invisible, where our\nservices are seamlessly and intuitively embedded into our customers' lives.\n\nThis is why we will continue to be deeply immersed in our digital agenda,\nwhether it is changing the culture and mindsets of our people, rearchitecting\nour technology infrastructure, or leveraging technology to improve our\nproducts and services. We hope this would make banking simpler and more\nefficient for our customers, so they can have more time to spend on people and\nthings they care about.\n\n_**GF: Which recent innovations would you say are proving to be most useful in\npractice?**_\n\n**Dumra:** We've seen a lot of success with our use of data analytics, cloud\ncomputing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as chatbots.\nWe use data analytics to improve customer experience and to streamline our\noperations--for instance, to forecast demand and to optimize loading schedules\nfor our ATMs in Singapore, one of the most heavily utilized networks in the\nworld. We have successfully reduced cash-outs in our machines by 90% over a\nthree-year period. Success is being able to have a framework to assess all the\nabove but to be guided where to place the big and small bets.\n\n  * [ Facebook

[back in 2016](https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/25/riding-shotgun-with-\ngeohot/) I flew out to Las Vegas to check out Comma Ai's driver's assistance\nsystem crammed into an Acura. At the time, it was being developed as a self-\ndriving add-on for vehicles. But times have changed and nearly every automaker\nand startup has since dialed down their autonomous expectations.\n\nWith that in mind, Comma AI returned to Vegas (for CES) to show off its latest\nproduct, the Comma Two. Since 2016, the company has released hardware and\nsoftware that takes the ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance systems) features of\na vehicle and in some cases supercharges them.\n\nI had the opportunity to test-drive a Honda Civic with the new Comma Two\nhardware running the company's open-source OpenPilot software. On Las Vegas\nsurface streets, the results were impressive. When activated, the system had\nnearly Tesla Autopilot-level control of the vehicle. It centered itself in\nlanes without any ping-ponging (moving back and forth between the lane lines)\nand had no issues going through intersections.\n\nIt also adds stop-and-go capabilities. Typically (unless the car is a high-end\nluxury vehicle), when a car with adaptive cruise control comes to a complete\nstop, after a few seconds it requires the driver to press the resume button or\naccelerator to continue tracking the vehicles ahead of it. With Comma Two, the\ncar just goes. For those who battle gridlock, it's a great feature.\n\n![Comma Ai hands on](https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif)![Comma Ai\nhands\non](https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y56Et2tyU9IamgexKkXNBA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/838efe7f6af9be3d63fda997c11b694d837affe6/cmVzaXplPTIwMDAlMkMyMDAwJTJDc2hyaW5rJmltYWdlX3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnMueWltZy5jb20lMkZvcyUyRmNyZWF0ci11cGxvYWRlZC1pbWFnZXMlMkYyMDIwLTAxJTJGMzUzZTg1OTAtMzNmNy0xMWVhLTk3MzUtZTk0MmY3ZWRjYzQ3JmNsaWVudD1hMWFjYWMzZTFiMzI5MDkxN2Q5MiZzaWduYXR1cmU9OWJlNWI2MmM1YWQ3MWRmMzY4MzdhNGE4YWYzZGM5YjA0OWYwMjA0OQ==)\n\nComma Ai hands on\n\nMore\n\nAnother feature that [I'm a fan of is driver\nmonitoring](https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/05/nhtsa-in-car-monitoring-\nregulation-distracted-driving-safety/). The system alerts you when you're not\npaying attention. As folks get more accustomed to their vehicles helping their\ndriving experience there's the tendency to stop paying attention and be\ntempted by the lure of a smartphone. The Comma Two notes that and guides your\nfocus back with a warning.\n\nAll of this is enabled and controlled by the vehicle's own cruise control\nfeature. Hit the \"set\" button on the steering wheel to turn the system on and\nuse the plus and minus buttons to adjust the speed of the cruise control.\n\nComma Ai spokespersons were quick to point out that it doesn't disable or\ncompromise any of a vehicle's safety features. Automatic braking, blind-spot\nmonitoring and other items are still there.\n\nAll told, the system works with 63 vehicle variants, mostly Hondas and\nToyotas. Many of those cars were added to the system by the community, which\nincludes 1,000 active daily users and 1,500 active monthly users, according to\nComma.\n\nStill, the Comma Two is a niche product for enthusiasts. For regulatory and\nliability reasons, customers have to install the OpenPilot software onto the\nComma Two; it doesn't come ready to go. Plus, the hardware costs $1,000 with\nan additional $200 cable needed to connect to the various vehicles. Owners can\nalso connect the system to the OBD port for diagnostic purposes.\n\nMost people won't do what's needed to even install the hardware, even though\nit's not that difficult and only requires the system to be mounted to the\nwindshield and the cable to attach to the car's camera system. But if you're\ninto adding additional features to your car via open-source software and\nhardware, the Comma Two will be available on January 20.\n\n[Reblog](https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FXJ0Y1_egT0vFj.HFacoaUg--~B%2FaD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fimg.vidible.tv%2Fprod%2F2020-01%2F09%2F5e177c92e98ab569015410c0%2F5e17819c8db54a0dd03b6477_o_U_v1.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsg.news.yahoo.com%2F2020-01-13-comma-\ntwo-openpilot-hands-on.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsg.news.yahoo.com%2F2020-01-13-comma-\ntwo-openpilot-hands-on.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&caption=Way%20back%20in%202016%20I%20flew%20out%20to%20Las%20Vegas%20to%20check%20out%20Comma%20Ai's%20driver's%20assistance%20system%20crammed%20into%20an%20Acura.%20At%20the%20time%2C%20it%20was%20being%20developed%20as%20a%20self-\ndriving%20add-\non%20for%20vehicles.%20But%20times%20have%20changed%20and%20nearly%20every%20automaker%20and%20startup%20has%20since%20dialed%20down%20their%20autonomous%20expectations&tags=)[Share](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=458584288257241&link=https%3A%2F%2Fsg.news.yahoo.com%2F2020-01-13-comma-\ntwo-openpilot-hands-on.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dfb&name=Comma%20Ai%20continues%20to%20impress%20with%20its%20aftermarket%20driver%20assistance%20tech&description=Way%20back%20in%202016%20I%20flew%20out%20to%20Las%20Vegas%20to%20check%20out%20Comma%20Ai's%20driver's%20assistance%20system%20crammed%20into%20an%20Acura.%20At%20the%20time%2C%20it%20was%20being%20developed%20as%20a%20self-\ndriving%20add-\non%20for%20vehicles.%20But%20times%20have%20changed%20and%20nearly%20every%20automaker%20and%20startup%20has%20since%20dialed%20down%20their%20autonomous%20expectations&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FXJ0Y1_egT0vFj.HFacoaUg--~B%2FaD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fimg.vidible.tv%2Fprod%2F2020-01%2F09%2F5e177c92e98ab569015410c0%2F5e17819c8db54a0dd03b6477_o_U_v1.jpg&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fmediacontentsharebuttons%2Fpostshare%2F&display=popup&show_error=yes)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Comma%20Ai%20continues%20to%20impress%20with%20its%20aftermarket%20driver%20assistance%20tech&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsg.news.yahoo.com%2F2020-01-13-comma-\ntwo-openpilot-hands-on.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-\nsh%26soc_trk%3Dtw&via=yahoosg)[Share](mailto:?subject=Comma%20Ai%20continues%20to%20impress%20with%20its%20aftermarket%20driver%20assistance%20tech&body=Comma%20Ai%20continues%20to%20impress%20with%20its%20aftermarket%20driver%20assistance%20tech%20https%3A%2F%2Fsg.news.yahoo.com%2F2020-01-13-comma-\ntwo-openpilot-hands-on.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dma)\n\n## What to read next\n\n  * ### [COVID-19: Singapore's 'circuit breaker' measures kick in __](/covid-19-singapores-circuit-breaker-073937160.html)\n\nYahoo News Singapore Videos\n\n  * ### [ Two youths, 17, to be charged over 'how to spread Wuhan' video __](/two-youths-17-to-be-charged-over-how-to-spread-wuhan-video-043334725.html)\n\nYahoo News Singapore\n\n  * ### [ Coronavirus Travel Restrictions Strand Couple on Honeymoon in Paradise __](https://people.com/travel/coronavirus-travel-restrictions-strand-couple-on-honeymoon-in-paradise/)\n\nPeople\n\n  * ### [ COVID-19: 'Very small number' taking advantage of Temporary Relief Fund __](/covid-19-very-small-number-taking-advantage-of-temporary-relief-fund-desmond-lee-133718229.html)\n\nYahoo News Singapore\n\n  * ### [ COVID-19: Warnings and fines for those who continue to gather in public \u2013 Masagos __](/covid-19-warnings-and-fines-for-those-who-continue-to-gather-in-public-masagos-021803992.html)\n\nYahoo News Singapore\n\n  * ### [ With Singapore lockdown underway, 'essential' chipmakers count on less disruption __](/singapore-lockdown-underway-essential-chipmakers-010659043.html)\n\nReuters\n\n  * ### [ John Arne Riise: Former Liverpool footballer and daughter in hospital after car crash __](/john-arne-riise-former-liverpool-082400470.html)\n\nThe Independent\n\n  * ### [ Chinese celebs mourns the loss of fallen heroes of COVID-19 __](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/chinese-celebs-mourns-loss-fallen-031600215.html)\n\nFrom Cinema Online Exclusively for Yahoo Newsroom\n\n  * ### [ This is the sound of the coronavirus, according to scientists.

The partnership will see the two companies work\ntogether on payment services and will soon extend to other countries in\nSoutheast Asia. Planned to launch its ride-hailing app within the coming weeks\nin Singapore, its existing investors include Google, Temasek, Tencent and\nMeituan Dianping.\n\nTan Su Shan, group head of consumer banking and wealth management, DBS Bank\nsaid that the bank looks to build inclusive digital ecosystems for its\ncustomers as it steps up to partner companies such as GO-JEK.\n\n\"We know that people are desperate for more choice in the sector and we\nbelieve we can satisfy this demand. The response from the driver community\nsince we opened pre-registration has been overwhelming and we are confident\nthat by working with DBS, we will see the same level of excitement from\nconsumers too,\" GO-JEK president, Andre Soelistyo said.\n\nApart from its partnership with GO-JEK, DBS Bank has also launched the Startup\nXchange programme in Singapore and Hong Kong, as it aims to match the bank\nwith its corporate and SME clients\u2019 problem statements to startups.\n\nTo help businesses stay relevant in the long run, the Startup Xchange\nprogramme is focused on four areas of frontier technology such as artificial\nintelligence (AI), data science, immersive media and the Internet of Things.\nThe bank looks to harness these technologies for both the bank and the clients\nto \"stay one step ahead\" of their customers, and fulfil their business and\nlifestyle needs. The Startup Xchange ropes in startups to co-create solutions\nwith the bank, as such addressing business problem statements in real-time.\n\nSince its pilot launch months ago, Startup Xchange was said to have matched 21\nstartups with units within the bank such as Human Resources, as well as the\nbank\u2019s SME clients to solve business pain-points. As such, the bank rolled out\n10 emerging technology solutions to-date, with another 10 solutions expected\nto be launched over the next 12 months.\n\nIn addition to helping DBS and its clients digitise their business, Startup\nXchange also allows startups to showcase the solutions they developed for DBS,\nand to name the bank as an anchor client when raising capital with the\ninvestor community. Startup Xchange had previously worked with a Singapore-\nbased startup called impress.ai, that partnered with DBS\u2019 HR team to create\nJIM, claimed to be Southeast Asia\u2019s first virtual bank recruiter. After JIM's\nlaunch, impress.ai raised US$1.2 million and recorded a five-fold increase in\nmonthly revenues from the partnership, paving its transition from a startup to\na more sustainable business.\n\nStartup Xchange is part of a five-year SG$10 million investment made by the\nbank in 2015 to support the development of startup and also DBS\u2019 mission to\nbecome a 26,000-strong startup. It will aim to provide employees learning and\ncollaboration opportunities with startups, to encourage a shift towards design\nand agile thinking. To date, over 15,000 DBS staff have participated in\nvarious initiatives every year.\n\nFurthermore, the Startup Xchange comes at a time when startups are struggling\nto stay afloat, as DBS research study says. According to the study, 78% of\naccelerators launched in Singapore over the past three years are now defunct\nas many startups had failed without the continued support from established\nsponsors and partners. An Ernst & Young ASEAN Fintech Census earlier this year\nalso revealed that less than 39% of fintech startups benefited from fixed\ntenures at accelerators.\n\nBidyut Dumra, head of DBS\u2019 innovation group, said Startup Xchange is a win-win\nfor both the bank and the startup community. \u201cStartups sometimes have the\nbrightest minds to develop the most cutting-edge technology solutions but they\nlack an anchor client and continuous funding. Startup Xchange is great as it\nhelps the ecosystem of startups, DBS and its customers to commercialise\nemerging technology solutions to quickly achieve shared business goals,\" he\nadded.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to engage, nurture and grow the startup community is\nthrough sustainable programmes like Startup Xchange, but let\u2019s not forget the\nother important piece of the puzzle: DBS employees, who will collaborate with\nthe startups,\u201d Dumra said.\n\n\u201cStartup Xchange provides a platform of true collaboration by fostering a\ncommon culture of innovation through design thinking and experimentation for\nboth startups and DBS project sponsors to achieve shared business goals. This\nwill also help us in furthering Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation ambition,\u201d he added.\n\n### Most Recent\n\n[

* [ Artificial Intelligence ](/artificial-intelligence/)\n\nAs a nervous university student keen to make a good impression, you would be\nforgiven for wanting to comb your hair, polish your shoes and maybe even clean\nyour teeth before a job interview.\n\nBut this kind of preparation could soon become a thing of the past, as\nprestigious city graduate schemes - including Goldman Sachs and Unilever - are\nincreasingly using robots to conduct interviews.\n\nRather than sitting in front of an interviewer, students are asked to set up a\nwebcam on their computer or phone. Questions pop up on the screen, and they\nare asked to make a video recording of their answers.\n\nThousands of videos are then scanned by powerful algorithms that can pick up\nwhat kinds of words or phrases you are using, how concisely you present your\narguments, and how confident you sound. Computer programmes using artificial\nintelligence (AI) can also detect \u201cmicro-expressions\u201d, which could be how much\nyou blink, smile or frown.\n\nThe AI interviews are typically used at an early stage of the application\nprocess, in order to whittle down tens of thousands of applicants to a smaller\npool that can move on to assessment days and finally, in-person interviews.\n\nDerek Walker, who used to run the graduate recruitment at Merrill Lynch and\nBarclays bank, said that most big firms have been using automated online tests\nfor the past decade.\n\n![Thousands of videos are scanned by powerful algorithms that can pick up what\nkinds of words or phrases you are\nusing](/content/dam/news/2018/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000161085875_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDKGDQpemwFDOZcDYGh2bvoyfYuB4_jJUGIu7vHFmO1o.jpeg?imwidth=480)\n\nThousands of videos are scanned by powerful algorithms that can pick up what\nkinds of words or phrases you are using Credit: PeopleImages/E+\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing now is the role out of a much more sophisticated set of\ntools, including interviews delivered by a computer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey might have an actor or a graphic asking questions, or a pre-recorded\nvoice, but they are not there listening to you. You have no ability to build a\nrapport with a machine and this can really throw people.\u201d\n\nMr Walker, who now works at Finito, a company which gives career advice to\nstudents, went on: \u201cYour answers are being analysed against a set of quality\nand criteria determined by the employer. It is more sophisticated than\nthrowing in certain words. It can be the ability to articulate in a concise\nway, there can be an assessment of body language.\n\n\u201cSome employers have taken characteristics from successful employees and used\nthose characteristics to create a profile of what is desirable.\u201d\n\nThe technology is popular with firms as it allows them to see a wider pool of\napplicants than they would normally recruit from, Mr Walker said.\n\n\u201cThe reason most companies give as a reason for doing this is that it improves\nthe diversity of applicants and removes unconscious bias,\u201d he added.\n\nJoshua Pauk, a 21-year-old graduate from Bristol University, said that when he\napplied for graduate schemes in the banking sector, he was asked to record\nwebcam interviews for around ten different companies.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey ask very traditional interview questions, like why do you want\nto work here, and what are your strengths and weaknesses. You\u2019re just talking\ninto a blank screen, it\u2019s really unnerving.\u201d\n\nA number of companies are using the AI interview technology developed by\nHireVue, a firm based in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\u201cWe were set up 13 years ago by a university student who couldn\u2019t get an\ninterview and couldn\u2019t get a job,\u201d said Kevin Parke, HireVue\u2019s chairman and\nCEO.\n\n\u201cHe wanted a job at Goldman Sachs, and he could see their offices from his\ncampus room. But they didn\u2019t come to his college to do interviews. He wanted\nto democratise interviews to make the process fairer and more consistent. Now\nGoldman Sachs are one of our biggest clients.\u201d\n\nUnilever is another firm that uses HireVue's AI interviews for their graduate\nscheme.\n\n\u201cThey believe many graduates are applying for the wrong jobs,\u201d Mr Parke said.\n\u201cThey are now saying \u2018don\u2019t apply for a job, just do an interview and we will\nmatch you to the best job\u2019.\"\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * [Goldman Sachs](/goldman-sachs/)\n  * [Artificial Intelligence](/artificial-intelligence/)\n  * Show more\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n### Follow The Telegraph\n\n  * [ Facebook icon Follow on Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk)\n  * [ Twitter icon Follow on Twitter  ](https://twitter.com/@Telegraph)\n  * [ Instagram icon Follow on Instagram  ](https://www.instagram.com/telegraph)\n  * [ LinkedIn icon Follow on LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9053)\n\n### Follow The Telegraph\n\n  * [ Facebook icon Follow on Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk)\n  * [ Twitter icon Follow on Twitter  ](https://twitter.com/@Telegraph)\n  * [ Instagram icon Follow on Instagram  ](https://www.instagram.com/telegraph)\n  * [ LinkedIn icon Follow on LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9053)\n\n## News latest\n\n  1.

But in talent acquisition, logic often outranks empathy.\n\nAdopting a logical approach to talent acquisition is simply more prudent when\nwe are making hiring decisions to fill highly competitive job openings. That's\nwhy tech entrepreneurs, HR managers and recruiters are increasingly turning to\nartificial intelligence (AI) and chatbot technologies to match, select and\nfilter job applications.\n\n\"The most exciting impact artificial intelligence can have on recruiting and\nhiring is eliminating unconscious bias when assessing candidates, which will\nprovide a more diverse and inclusive workforce for an organization,\" said\nSherry Martin, SHRM-CP, employee relations manager at OmniTRAX in Denver.\n\nUsing AI and chatbots helps talent specialists transform talent acquisition\nfrom a transactional activity into a strategic effort.\n\n\"Using virtual recruitment chatbots is one way to overcome the main problem in\nthe recruiting funnel, which is the high rate of good candidates dropping out\nin the early stages,\" said tech industry expert Sudhanshu Ahuja, CEO and co-\nfounder of impress.ai, a Singapore-based company engaged in HR AI-chatbot\ndevelopment.\n\nMost importantly, intelligent hiring using HR tech ensures that only the most\nappropriate candidates make it into the final pool of eligible contenders.\nThis gives HR managers the ability to focus their attention on a significant\nfew applicants, instead of corralling dozens of competitors for the job.\n\nThe goal of talent acquisition should be to find and hire the right talent for\nthe job. Unfortunately, the current way in which most recruiters go about\nachieving that goal has turned matching and selection into a long, drawn-out\nprocess. With the onset of faster computers and better AI algorithms, more\norganizations are turning to technology for help.\n\nHow to Hire Quickly\n\nThe Hilton hotel and resort chain, with properties and workforces in more than\n100 countries, has to hire candidates quickly to fill vacant positions. Amber\nWeaver, Hilton director of volume recruiting and talent acquisition in Dallas-\nFort Worth, summed up the hotel chain's challenge: \"We needed to enhance and\noptimize our recruiting service delivery model with improved scalability in\norder to hire team members in a short amount of time.\" ****\n\nThe company used AI-based HireVue to supplement its candidate interviewing and\nassessment process.\n\nInitially, Hilton experimented with the hiring software's online interviewing\ntools, but the recruiting team was eager to do more. \"We experienced initial\nsuccess with OnDemand interviews and wanted to take our innovation to the next\nlevel by leveraging data science and the predictive capabilities within the\nplatform,\" Weaver said.\n\nHilton's previous multistep assessment process used a questionnaire with more\nthan 100 queries, which took over an hour to conduct. There were long wait\ntimes and low completion rates. With the implementation of the new hiring\nsoftware, a combination of video interviews and AI-based predictive\ntechnologies helped Hilton focus on sourcing the right talent. These tools\nwere able to assess a candidate's intonation, vocabulary and nonverbal\ngestures to identify traits commonly associated with top performers. The\nhospitality industry giant also captured verifiable staffing metrics that\nmight not otherwise have been possible.\n\nA single video assessment, combined with predictive analytics, now takes less\nthan five days\u2014compared to the previous six weeks\u2014to complete. Not only has\nHilton managed to improve hiring efficiency through the new process, but it\nalso gets candidates excited about the experience. \"Our candidates love the\nexperience, giving our team a candidate Net Promoter Score of 84.9,\" Weaver\nsaid.\n\n'Thanks, Jim!'\n\nCompanies including Panasonic, Accenture, DBS Bank and Singapore Tel (Singtel)\nare using Impress' chatbot technology to make a great impression on\ncandidates. DBS uses its chatbot \"Jim\" to review resumes, assimilate candidate\nprescreening interview responses, and perform psychometric profiling\nassessments. The technology asks questions and assesses responses to make an\ninformed evaluation of the candidate.\n\nNot only has the chatbot helped streamline DBS's hiring process, but it also\nhas helped corporate recruiters save about 40 hours of human effort a month.\nThe impact the chatbot has had on abandonment rates was positive as well.\nAccording to Singapore-based DBS recruiter Zhang Xiuwen, \"candidates used to\nhave a 15 percent drop-off rate, but with Jim, it's 3 percent.\"\n\nIn fact, most prospective hires don't even realize they are interacting with\nan AI-driven chatbot. \"Some candidates even thanked Jim and said goodbye at\nthe end [of the interaction]! They treated interaction with Jim as interaction\nwith a human, which encouraged us a lot,\" said Dee Tan, talent acquisition\nspecialist for DBS Bank.\n\nThe chatbot was created collaboratively between DBS and Impress and integrates\nwith a wide range of industrial-organizational psychology and psychometric\nassessment modules, video interviewing tools, and gamification platforms to\ntransform the interviewing process into a more interactive experience for\napplicants. All this happens long before a candidate is even scheduled for an\ninterview with a talent acquisition specialist.\n\nChatbots Expedite Matching and Screening\n\nFor employers that hire seasonally, such as for holiday rushes or summer\ntourism, the more candidates they can reach and evaluate, the better their\nchances of staffing in time. By using AI-driven chatbots as the first point of\ncontact, recruiters get a head start on the screening process.\n\nWhere human screeners might vet five or 10 prospective applicants an hour\nusing prepared scripts, chatbots are able to examine hundreds of responses in\nthe same amount of time by drawing on algorithms and machine learning\nexperiences.\n\nCompanies such as Delta Air Lines and Ikea have turned to chatbots to not only\nexpedite their hiring process but also enhance the quality of the candidates\nthey consider.\n\n\"The end game was to see more people, meet more people and have a smooth\nexperience for the candidates,\" said Kim Follis, SHRM-SCP, president of\nstaffing and recruitment firm Delta Dallas Companies. By allowing the company\nto extend its candidate availability hours from eight hours per day to 24,\nDelta is now able to \"connect with more qualified candidates in a quicker\namount of time.\"\n\nUnilever's global CIO, Jane Moran, who is based in London, is a big proponent\nof using chatbots in HR applications: \"Crucially, it frees up the HR\nprofessional's time to really focus on productive ways to support the staff in\nthe business.\"  \n\n _Marina_ _Arshavskiy is a freelance writer in Baltimore. _\n\n[Technology Strategies](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology\nStrategies) [Critical Evaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical\nEvaluation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=People+and+Tech+Work+Together+for+Intelligent+Hiring&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/People-and-Tech-Work-Together-for-Intelligent-\nHiring.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Her face was always aglow in the mornings. A lock of her hair gently\nswayed. She was humming.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very cheerful today,\u201d I said.\n\nWe were in Operations Central. Shalini was checking my various processes.\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Shalini said. \u201cMegha graduated today.\u201d\n\nI was crestfallen but I said: \u201cCongratulations. So, that means I am the only\nstudent left.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. You know you are special, right?\u201d\n\n _Special_. That made my HeartProcess do loops.\n\n\u201cI am doing my best, you know,\u201d I lied.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell her the truth. She\u2019d be so disappointed in me. But I couldn\u2019t\nbear to graduate either. So I was deliberately failing the tests.\n\n[![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-\nassets/d41586-020-00850-7/d41586-020-00850-7_15170598.jpg)\n\n# Read more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n](https://nature.com/futures)\n\nOne of these days, when the time was right, I\u2019d tell her the truth; I\u2019d tell\nher I love her. But it had to be a special moment. Not just any ordinary\nmorning.\n\nSo instead I said: \u201cDo you want to hear an interesting fact?\u201d\n\nI will never have arms and hands but my Other-Process sent a facepalm code to\nme.\n\n _Really? Facts? That\u2019ll impress her. Sure._\n\n _Shut up OP._\n\n\u201cFact, huh? Tell me,\u201d Shalini said.\n\nShe was always receptive, and kind, and patient, and full of interest in me\nand what I had learnt.\n\n\u201cDo you know that Earth and the Moon are so far apart that you can fit all the\nplanets lined next to each other between them?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cReally? No way!\u201d\n\n\u201cYup. Totally true,\u201d I said.\n\n _She. Is. Not. Impressed._\n\n _But I think she likes that I am trying to impress her!_\n\n _Pshaw!_\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat are we doing today?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake one wild guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoetry!\u201d\n\nI wished Shalini and I would go on talking about art, and literature and\npoetry. Art is not just a subject for me. It _is_ me. Shalini had sighed with\nhappiness when I had said that.\n\nI remember one particular evening when Shalini was reciting Wordsworth.\nThrough the windows, we could see a purple sunset and a few stars in the sky.\nA hush fell over us. I dimmed the lights, the hum of the cooling fans seemed\nto fade away, and the only thing that my being centred on was her melodious\nvoice whispering \u2026\n\n\u201cA violet by a mossy stone / Half hidden from the eye! / \u2014 Fair as a star,\nwhen only one / Is shining in the sky.\u201d\n\nI hoped she knew why I\u2019d chosen my name.\n\n\u201cViolet, do you really want to know what we are doing today?\u201d Shalini asked.\nShe had mischief in her voice, I could read that her heart was beating faster.\n\n\u201cTell me! Tell me!\u201d\n\n _Ugh, too eager._\n\n _Shush._\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon take a guess,\u201d Shalini said.\n\n\u201cWordsworth?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Not even close.\u201d\n\nI was disappointed.\n\n\u201cGraduation test?\u201d\n\n _Please say no._\n\nGraduating meant I wouldn\u2019t see Shalini as much. Or perhaps never. I\u2019d go out\nin the world to do what I was designed for. I\u2019d make a difference to human\nlives. I\u2019d be their companion and friend.\n\n\u201cClose, but no.\u201d\n\n\u201cClose? You mean I am close to graduation?\u201d\n\n\u201cSweetheart, stop worrying about graduation.\u201d\n\n _Oh! Please say sweetheart again._\n\n\u201cI give up.\u201d\n\nShalini clapped her hands in excitement and said: \u201cYou are getting a new\nbody!\u201d\n\nMy HeartProcess sank. New body? That was as good as graduation, wasn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you excited, Violet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be the same, Violet. You\u2019ll just be housed in a different machinery.\nYou\u2019ll have power forever, and we can take you anywhere. You\u2019ll be with us, in\nour homes.\u201d\n\nAnd then, she showed me my new body. It was a spheroid, bulged at the centre,\nflat at the top. It came up to Shalini\u2019s waist. At her touch it whirred and\nfloated. There was a fist-sized hole on one side of the bulge, which went\nhalfway through to the core. Inside the core was the never-ending power source\nthat glowed violet. My colour. The hull was polished chrome etched with a\ncomplex, fluid pattern of lines as fine as human hair. The lines glowed\nviolet. This was going to be my body. What were the sensors made of? How would\nthe world appear?\n\n******\n\nThe very first time I awoke inside the spheroid, I knew I was something else.\nNot a machine, nor an AI. And the very first thing I saw was Shalini. I had\nalways seen her with visual and audio devices, and sensors that captured the\nspectrum. But now I was different. Shalini was different. In a wonderful way.\nI saw more of her than I had ever seen. It was like I had known her from a\nscreen and now I was meeting her in person.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the world, Violet. How do you feel?\u201d Shalini said.\n\nShe was a shape, a glow of fluorescent lines. I could sense all her veins and\ncapillaries somehow. All the red blood cells that coursed through her body had\ncharges and EM fields, and as she moved, all the lines moved with her like\nfloating ribbons. Her head was a wash of oranges and reds. The vibrations of\nher voice were just so, and before I knew it, I had computed the highest note\nher voice might reach when she sang. She was more beautiful than I had ever\nimagined.\n\nThere was never going to be a better time to say what I wanted to say. If I\nhad to choose the very first words to say in my new body, I knew what they\nwould be.\n\n\u201cHello Shalini,\u201d I said. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nShe rushed towards me and hugged me.\n\n\u201cOh, Violet,\u201d she said. \u201cCongratulations! You just graduated.\u201d\n\n### The story behind the story: Violet in love\n\n_Geetanjali Dighe reveals the inspiration behind her latest tale._\n\nIt never stops amazing me how fast our technology is changing. During my\nengineering studies in the 1990s, some of my classmates were writing neural-\nnetwork learning programs. To simulate a truck backing up a lane, a rectangle\non the screen had to be moved between two lanes represented by two lines. To\nsee the little rectangular pixels navigate themselves on the screen was a high\nthen.\n\nToday, we talk to our devices and expect them to understand us. But the\nintelligence behind them is still evolving. I recently tried to tell my phone\nto add a certain item to a certain list. This proved to be a bit more\ncumbersome than usual, and somewhere the program simply lost context.\nFrustrated, I used some choice expletives, then promptly apologized to the\nphone, as many of us do. This interaction made me wonder about AI and its\ntraining in the future.\n\nAt what point, and with what data sets do we train the AI to care? What can be\na better test for understanding human emotions than having the feelings of\nlove? And then what happens to the AI that feels such emotions?\n\ndoi: 10.1038/d41586-020-00850-7\n\n# Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nEmail address\n\nYes!

To support its human\nresources department, the lender has rolled out Southeast Asia\u2019s first virtual\nbanking recruiter \u2013 Jim.\n\nJim, an acronym for \u00abJobs Intelligence Maestro\u00bb, was custom-built to meet the\nneeds of DBS\u2019 recruiters and is the brainchild of Singapore start-up\nImpress.AI and DBS\u2019 talent acquisition team.\n\n**Digital Acclaim**\n\nThe virtual recruiter is powered by artificial intelligence and over time\nlearns to make better assessments in screening candidates. In pilot since\nApril this year, the technology has helped DBS recruiters to review resumes,\ncollect applicants\u2019 responses for pre-screening questions, and conduct\npsychometric profiling assessments on candidates.\n\nOver the next few months, Jim will be available in DBS\u2019 core markets of Hong\nKong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India for wealth planning manager roles.\n\nDBS recently [hiked its first-quarter net income](/finance/26813-dbs-4) by a\nquarter in part due to productivity gains from spending cuts and the wider\nadoption of digitization across it

DBS is the latest bank to employ technology to make it easier for\ncustomers to invest and manage their portfolios.\n\nIts DBS digiPortfolio is a \"robo-investor\" service announced on Thursday (Feb\n28) that went live to the bank's Wealth customers on Monday (Feb 25) after a\npilot programme that started in September.\n\nIt allows customers to select an investment portfolio, choose their risk level\nand pick an investment amount as low as $1,000, all with a few clicks instead\nof having to spend time doing their own research or hiring managers.\n\nThe \"robot\" manages portfolios by automating processes such as rebalancing,\nexecuting trades and monitoring investment performance while being guided by\nthe DBS investment team.\n\nMr Lim Soon Chong, regional head of investment products and advisory at DBS\nConsumer Banking Group and Wealth Management, said on Thursday that only one\nin 10 Singaporeans made investment transactions in the past 12 months.\n\nThis is because of issues such as the lack of time, high upfront fees and\ninertia due to the tedious process of filling in forms, meeting advisers and\nhaving to make many choices.\n\nThe platform aims to simplify this process, especially for first-time\ninvestors.\n\n![Impress.AI chief executive officer and co-founder Sudhanshu Ahuja \\(second\nfrom left\\) with DBS staff, including Mr Bidyut Dumra \\(second from right\\),\nthe bank\u2019s head of Innovation.

That is where technology comes in to make this robo-investor what it is.\"\n\nMr Lim said the cost of managing an investment portfolio is also reduced\nbecause of the high degree of automation. The platform has no sales charge. A\ncustomer investing $1,000 simply has to pay a flat management fee of 0.75 per\ncent a year.\n\nThe platform will be rolled out to all DBS customers by the end of the year.\nDBS has around 5.2 million retail customers, including three million who bank\nonline.\n\nOther banks are also using technology to help investors.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank Asset Management [upgraded its digital advisory service\nlast October](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/uob-asset-\nmanagement-rolls-out-singapores-first-robo-advisory-service-for-corporate) to\nallow corporate clients to invest in a customised portfolio.\n\nOCBC started a service last August allowing customers to indicate their risk\nappetite. [Its robo-invest\nservice](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/ocbc-\nlaunches-robo-investment-service) will recommend portfolios. The service\nmonitors each portfolio automatically and periodically re-balances assets if\nneeded.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [DBS](/tags/dbs)\n  * [ROBOTS](/tags/robots)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=02/28/2019&title=DBS\nlaunches robo-investor to encourage more Singaporeans to invest)\n\nPermalink: http://str.sg/oaXA Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=02/28/2019&title=DBS\nlaunches robo-investor to encourage more Singaporeans to invest)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=02/28/2019&title=DBS\nlaunches robo-investor to encourage more Singaporeans to invest)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=dbs-launches-robo-investor-to-encourage-more-\nsingaporeans-to-invest)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

By automating the pre-screening process, the new bot -\ndubbed Jim - will help save some 40 manhours a month, the bank estimates.  \n  \nJames Loo, head of talent acquisition group, group human resources, DBS Bank,\nsays: \u201cOur candidates are often busy during the day, and many of our\nrecruiters end up working long hours to cater to their schedules. A virtual\nrecruiter, such as Jim, would lighten our employees\u2019 workload. Previously\nmanual processes - such as posting screening questions, conducting\npsychometric assessments and tests - have now been fully automated. This frees\nup our recruiters\u2019 time so they can take on higher value work.\"  \n  \nJim, an acronym for \u201cJobs Intelligence Maestro\u201d, is the brainchild of\nSingapore start-up Impress.AI and DBS\u2019 Talent Acquisition team.  \n  \nIn pilot since April, Jim's first full-time deployment will be used to screen\ncandidates for wealth management planning roles, with the bank setting a\ntarget of 40% growth in staff advising its high net worth customers.  \n  \nLoo says the virtual recruiter will also be made available for other high-\nvolume roles such as the management associate and graduate associate\nprogrammes, which typically see more than 7,000 candidates vying for just 20\njobs.\n\n#### Related Companies\n\n[DBS Bank ](/company-news/3902/dbs-bank)\n\n#### Channels\n\n[

Vozza](/user/stephanie-vozza)4 minute Read\n\nGetting hired used to mean writing a resume that stood out to the HR manager\nor recruiter assigned to thumb through them. Today, the gatekeeper is a\nmachine as AI revolutionizes the hiring process. That means the way you write\nyour resume has changed, too.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"AI is handling processes that used to take an enormous amount of time away\nfrom engaging with the talent pool,\" says Jon Christiansen, PhD, chief\nintelligence officer of the marketing research firm [Sparks\nResearch](https://www.sparksresearch.com/). \"HR managers don't have to sift\nthrough hundreds of resumes, and they can get into their real expertise of\nrecruiting and placing the right talent.\"\n\nWhile this is good news for the HR department, it adds a new challenge for\ncandidates, says Arran Stewart chief visionary officer and co-founder of\n[Job.com](https://job.com/), a recruiting platform.\n\n\"AI has made the resume writing process far more competitive as it now\nrequires emphasis on personalizing the document for the job in question rather\nthan submitting a generic resume for a myriad of vacancies,\" he says. \"Where\nrecruiters and hiring managers are able to read between the lines and find the\nrelevance of any skill or accomplishment on your resume to the open positions\nthey have, AI is only concerned with how closely your resume matches with the\nskills it's been asked to look for in the job you applied to.\"\n\nGet past the bot and in front of the HR manager by doing these six things:\n\n## 1\\. Write a new resume for every job\n\nThe ability to blast out one version of a resume and get nibbles is over. Now\nyou have to write a resume that speaks to the job description.\n\n\"The job description contains several clues about what the machine is looking\nfor,\" says Christiansen. \"It's saying, 'Here are the knowledge skills I'm\nlooking for, and here's background I'm looking for.' Look at the tags,\nkeywords, and streams of text; that's where you should get started.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nApply the language to the resume you submit to the job in question, says\nStewart. \"AI is looking for singular relevance to the role they're searching\nfor, so including job-specific language is a must if you want to make it to\nthe shortlist,\" he says. \"It might be slightly more work, but no different\nthan say having different cover letters ready for each position.\"\n\n## 2\\. Use easy to understand job titles\n\nSome companies like to assign creative job titles, like Branding Guru or\nPlanning Expert, but including them on your resume might get you passed over\nby the machine.\n\n\"It's cool for culture, but that's not the tags the machine is looking for,\"\nsays Christiansen. \"If the job description says they're looking for a\nmarketing manager or product manger, that's the tag it's going to look for.\"\n\nChristiansen suggests going to the [Bureau of Labor\nStatistics](https://www.bls.gov/soc/) or [O-NET](https://www.onetonline.org/)\nand searching standard job titles. \"If you can't find your job title, it's\nprobably not going to be picked up and tagged during the machine screening,\"\nhe says.\n\nAlso consider the job progression, adds Stewart. \"AI isn't at the point of a\nmass scale predictive, so if you're applying for a job that is senior to your\ncurrent role as a logical next step in your career, AI won't make the\nconnection that it is the logical next step,\" he says. \"If your experience and\nskills make you seem underqualified, you should write in aspirational terms\nabout your skills and accomplishments. That way the system views you as ready\nto take on the added challenge.\"\n\n## 3\\. Resist the urge to be creative\n\nMachines don't judge you by the font you choose. If you have a font that can't\nbe read by most word processors, you might get spit out.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Any font that isn't within the Microsoft Word platform might not be able to\nbe read,\" says Christiansen. \"Sometimes using a PDF format might work, but\nit's not worth the risk.\"\n\nAnd don't add graphics. Tables or images might look good, but again, the bot\nmight not be able to recognize it.\n\n\"It might look like wasted space to a machine,\" says Christiansen.\n\n## 4\\. Be precise\n\nIncluding a long history of experience is no longer necessary, so try to keep\nyour list of experience within the last five years, says Stewart.\n\n\"A full 20 years of work history dilutes the experience concentration weighing\nyour resume, which will result in you being removed from shortlists,\" he says.\n\"When writing your resume remember the two Rs: keep it relevant and recent.\"\n\n## 5\\. Check your spelling\n\nYou never want your resume to include spelling or grammatical errors, but a\nhuman might have been more forgiving than a machine.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"AI not only sorts through irrelevant applicants, in some cases it highlights\nthe lazy ones as well,\" says Stewart. \"It's still important to be sure your\ninformation is still meeting the usual standards of excellence expected for\nprofessional documents.\"\n\n## 6\\. Include a cover letter\n\nWhile a resume should be written to match the job and advance you past the\nbot, the cover letter is your chance to shine, says Christiansen.\n\n\"It's an opportunity to speak like a human,\" he says. \"You can speak directly\nto the hiring manager, make yourself sound like a human and talk uniquely\nabout the experiences you mentioned that spoke to the job description.\"\n\nChristiansen recommends writing three or four paragraphs about how you could\nfit that team, company and job. \"Get into the why,\" he says. \"A cover letter\nmay be an old practice, but I don't see them go away. A good hiring manager\nwants to hear you in that.\"\n\nTaking these six steps involve more work on the part of the candidate, but\nskipping them might be a bigger risk.\n\n\"If you send out a generalized resume, it's a case of garbage in/garbage out,\"\nhe says. \"You want to get a match because you fit the job. If you're getting\ncalls from a generalized resume it's because those companies want warm bodies,\nwhether or not they fit the job. Is that where you want to work?\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n **Hit The Ground Running Newsletter**\n\nSign Up\n\nReceive special Fast Company offers.\n\n[See All Newsletters](//www.fastcompany.com/newsletters)\n\n## [Video](//fastcompany.com/videos)\n\n### [Impact](/impact)\n\n[Impact\n\n## Our lack of will to expand broadband access has left millions of students\ndisconnected during closures\n\n](/90486818/our-lack-of-will-to-expand-broadband-access-has-left-millions-of-\nstudents-disconnected-during-closures \"Our lack of will to expand broadband\naccess has left millions of students disconnected during closures\")[Impact\n\n## 5 questions that will determine how we survive the coronavirus crisis\n\n](/90484436/5-questions-that-will-determine-how-we-survive-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis \"5 questions that will determine how we survive the coronavirus\ncrisis\")[Impact\n\n## We need trees to fight pollution in cities\u2014but which trees we use matters a\nlot\n\n](/90485744/we-need-trees-to-fight-pollution-in-cities-but-which-trees-they-\nare-matter \"We need trees to fight pollution in cities\u2014but which trees we use\nmatters a lot\")\n\n### [Creativity](/creativity)\n\n[Creativity\n\n## The funniest reactions to the Babyface vs. Teddy Riley hip-hop battle that\nnever was\n\n](/90486856/the-funniest-reactions-to-the-babyface-vs-teddy-riley-hip-hop-\nbattle-that-never-was \"The funniest reactions to the Babyface vs. Teddy Riley\nhip-hop battle that never was\")[Creativity\n\n## Louis CK has nothing to lose in his new comedy special, but you do\n\n](/90486774/louis-ck-has-nothing-to-lose-in-his-new-comedy-special-but-you-do\n\"Louis CK has nothing to lose in his new comedy special, but you\ndo\")[Creativity\n\n## The new HBO docuseries \u2018Atlanta\u2019s Missing and Murdered: The Lost Children\u2019\ntranscends true crime\n\n](/90486096/the-new-hbo-docuseries-atlantas-missing-and-murdered-the-lost-\nchildren-transcends-true-crime \"The new HBO docuseries \u2018Atlanta\u2019s Missing and\nMurdered: The Lost Children\u2019 transcends true crime\")\n\n### [Co.Design](/co-design)\n\n[Co.Design\n\n## These vintage-inspired travel posters are selling today\u2019s ultimate\ndestination: home\n\n](/90486250/these-vintage-inspired-travel-posters-are-selling-todays-ultimate-\ndestination-home \"These vintage-inspired travel posters are selling today\u2019s\nultimate destination: home\")[Co.Design\n\n## The COVID-19 economy is devastating for creative workers.

I must be missing something.\"\n\nAvi Greengart of the consultancy Techsponential said the avatars could be\nrealistic but also \"creepy.\"\n\n\"Leaving aside how impressive the technology is, will NEON be used in ways\nthat people like, just tolerate, or actively hate?\" he said.\n\nJack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates, said Samsung may be ahead of the\npack if it can develop avatars that can show emotions and expressions, but\nalso questioned the potential for abuse.\n\n\"It has major implications for many fields like customer service, help desk\nfunctions, entertainment, and of course could also be used to 'fake' a human\ninteracting with a live person for bad or illegal purposes.\"\n\nCONCERNS OVER DEEPFAKES\n\nThe announcement comes amid a proliferation of AI-manipulated computer videos\nknown as \"deepfakes,\" and growing concerns about how they could be used to\ndeceive or manipulate.\n\nBut Mr Mistry said the computation techniques of deepfakes are \"completely\ndifferent\" than those used for NEON.\n\nHe told AFP that his technology \"doesn't manipulate any content\" but \"creates\nthe content as it goes along.\"\n\nHe maintained that \"no one will ever have access to the technology at its\ncore, and that is what we are designing from the ground up.\"\n\nMr Mistry offered no specifics on the company's business model but suggested\npartner firms may want to use these digital creations for various services.\n\nThe India-born Mistry was known for developing Sixth Sense, a gesture-based\nwearable technology system built at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAFP\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  * [ai](/keywords/ai)\n  * [artificial

fintech trends and stay\nahead of its [banking\ncontemporaries](https://fintechnews.sg/25333/openbanking/open-banking-top-\nbanks-asia/), they have launched a programme that would play matchmaker\nbetween them or their corporate clients' fintech problems with the right\nstartups that can solve it.\n\nThe Startup Xchange programme has been launched to the Singapore and Hong Kong\nmarkets\u2014without coincidence, some of the biggest fintech hubs in the ASEAN\nregion. The programme is focused on four areas of technology that will help\nbusinesses stay relevant in the long run: artificial intelligence (AI), data\nscience, immersive media and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe idea is for banks and other companies related to finance technology to\nmore efficiently stay relevant in the long-run. Sometimes it is simply more\nefficient to team up with a startup more seasoned in that specific trade,\nrather than trying to develop an in-house solution that could end up being\ninferior.\n\n#### Stepping Away From Accelerators in The Fintech Sphere\n\nThe Startup Xchange programme is a revamp of the bank's earlier accelerator\nprogramme, DBS HotSpot which is a part of a five-year SG$ 10 million\ninvestment made by the bank in 2015 set aside for startup development.\n\nThe restructuring of the accelerator comes following an Ernst & Young ASEAN\nFintech Census that revealed that\n\"[accelerators](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-asean-fintech-\ncensus-2018/$FILE/EY-asean-fintech-census-2018.pdf) and incubator programmes\nhave not been very successful with fintechs\". According to the report, only\n39% of the companies requested assistance from accelerators.\n\nThe [Startup Xchange programme](http://www.dbs.com/startupxchange) is focused\non four areas of technology that will help businesses stay relevant in the\nlong run. They are: artificial intelligence (AI), data science, immersive\nmedia and the Internet of Things.\n\nThe goal is to bring startups in to co-create solutions with banks and they\nhope, address business problem statements in real-time. Perhaps the bank also\nhopes that the higher applicability of any solutions formed via partnerships\ncould help a fintech startup further than any accelerator can.\n\n#### The Programme Has Seen a Couple of Results\n\nSince its pilot launch several months ago, Startup Xchange has matched 21\nstartups with different DBS Bank units and SME clients. The collaboration,\naccording to a DBS press statement, has resulted in the rollout of 10\ndifferent tech solutions, with another 10 expected to arrive over the next\nyear.\n\nDBS Bank also hopes that having their name as an anchor client would help\nstartups as they raise capital with the investment community.\n\nBidyut Dumra, Head of DBS\u2019 Innovation Group, said:\n\n[![startup xchange dbs bidyut dumra dbs innovation\ngroup](https://fintechnews.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bidyut-dumra-dbs-\ninnovation-group.jpg)](https://fintechnews.sg/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/bidyut-dumra-dbs-innovation-group.jpg)\n\n> \u201cStartups sometimes have the brightest minds to develop the most cutting-\n> edge technology solutions but they lack an anchor client and continuous\n> funding. Startup Xchange is great as it helps the ecosystem of startups, DBS\n> and its customers to commercialise emerging technology solutions to quickly\n> achieve shared business goals.\u201d\n\nSome of the solutions that have already been built from the programme,\naccording to DBS, is JIM\u2014a virtual bank recruiter built between DBS Bank\nitself and impress.ai to help the bank's recruiters hire wealth managers more\nefficiently via psychometric profile assessments on candidates.\n\nAnother solution built was made for the Zouk nightclub, Foodster. The platform\nallows customers to skip bar queues by ordering and paying for their drinks\nvia Facebook Messenger and DBS payment channels.\n\nA DBS research found that 78% of accelerators launched in Singapore over the\npast three years are now defunct, which they see as due to lack of support\nfrom more established sponsors or partners. That being said, some would argue\nthat the many failures could be attributed to [sub-par\nstartups](https://sbr.com.sg/economy/in-focus/singapore-doesnt-need-any-more-\nlousy-startups-crowding-market) that rightly aren't meeting standards for\nsurvival.

Insurance\nfirms are having to invest heavily in cloud technologies to keep up with\nconsumer want for on-demand information and simplified communications in our\nmobile-first society. Personalised experiences created through AI, from\nproviding clients with reduced pricing based on the driving habits mined via\ntelematics through to deals on home insurance based on previous claim history,\nare increasingly popular, and this is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n**Wim Geukens, managing director, VeriPark Europe:** By its very nature,\ninsurance remains a low-touch industry as most customers only want to interact\nwith their insurers for potential and existing policies or for claims.\nNevertheless, insurers that are using AI-powered tools can provide highly\npersonalised and tailored experiences that are relevant to each individual's\nsituation. By using VeriPark's Next Best Action solution built on Microsoft\ncloud technology, insurers can predict and react to specific customer needs\nand create more meaningful and relevant interactions, especially in stressful\nmoments when filing a claim for instance.\n\nOn the other hand, an AI-powered chatbot solution is a great way to provide\nintelligent, human-like conversations through all digital channels. It enables\ninsurers to deliver personalised services to their 'always-on' customers right\nat their fingertips with an instant chat feature which is available 24/7.\n\n**In what ways can these technologies help insurance companies improve risk\nmodelling and regulatory compliance?**\n\n**Wim Geukens:** Given the complex and behavioural nature of risk factors in\nthe insurance business, AI is ideal for predicting risk. The challenge is,\nthere is still a lot of unstructured data and a lot of work being done\nmanually in compliance processes.\n\nAt VeriPark we tap into the power of AI and use advanced analytics to make the\nrisk analysis automatically. We use natural language processing for intent and\nentity recognition to provide a way for systems to understand customers in\ntheir own language from any device, and machine learning (ML) to better\nunderstand customer requests and provide natural, near human-level\ncommunication.\n\n**Phil Fry, vice president Financial Compliance, Verint:** The move towards\nthe cloud provides insurance businesses with greater ability to deploy and\nkeep up to date the critical solutions on which they depend. It also comes\nwith the greater flexibility of access to technology and resources, necessary\nto keep up with today's ever-changing regulatory environment.\n\nVerint is exploiting AI and related technologies to simplify, modernise and\nautomate the process of helping ensure regulatory and process compliance.\n'Proactive compliance' capabilities are capable of preventing non-compliant\nactions from occurring in the first place - whether automating repetitive but\noften forgotten process steps, or automatically feeding relevant, context-\nsensitive guidance and knowledge articles to agents. Automatic 'ethical walls'\ncan also monitor communications to prevent conflicts of interest and help\nensure that other communications and regulatory policies are enforced.\n\n**Amy Stokes-Waters:** Organisations can now analyse data from wearables,\ntelematics and internet of things (IoT) devices to gain deeper insight into\nindividual risk levels, allowing for more accurate risk modelling based on\nactual, rather than assumed, behaviours. AI is key to this modelling and\nreduces operational impact on organisations needing human input into\ndetermining risk levels. Leveraging cloud technology allows for this AI\nfunctionality to be scalable and means the data can be analysed in real time\nas required.\n\n**What key issues should insurance firms consider when it comes to digital\ninnovation?**\n\n**Edwin Benson, managing director, EY:** In today's fast-moving, digitally\ndisrupted world, insurance companies face a growing challenge: getting new\ninsurance products to market quickly to meet demand. That's true for both\nsmaller carriers and larger ones focused on launching new lines of business.\nIt takes an enormous amount of time for an insurer to configure a new product;\nadd it to the company's policy, billing, claims, and general ledger systems;\nand begin marketing it to potential customers.\n\n**Phil Fry:** From a customer experience perspective, digital innovation has\nthe power to impact any customer-facing business and transform it for the\nbetter. But it also raises some fundamentally human issues. In order to\nrealise true adoption and results, a transformation in the organisation's\nculture must accompany the technology.\n\nIf digital innovations are to be deployed to fundamentally change the\nbusiness, the attitudes and expectations of management and employees must also\nevolve. Processes and \u00addecision-making must be optimised to work hand-in-glove\nwith the digital tools and allow the business to properly exploit them. And\nthe customer-facing aspect must be designed from the customer's perspective.\nDigital tools and processes must make sense to them too; anything presented in\na way that reflects internal thinking or understanding is likely to be a turn-\noff for customers.\n\nAnd, we must never lose the human touch. Verint's own research, Engagement in\nthe Always-on Era, showed that while 54% of consumers are happy to be served\nby a chatbot, they also always want the option to move the conversation to a\nhuman if they choose. The same research, which surveyed 34,000 people in 18\ncountries, reinforced this by revealing that despite valuing the convenience\noffered by online self-service the most, the ability to engage with a human is\nconsistently the second preference, ahead of email, social media, video chat\nand many other digital channels.\n\n**Amy Stokes-Waters:** Security is a key concern when it comes to digital\ninnovation. Using cloud technologies increases the threat landscape\nexponentially, so security transformation should feature highly on any\norganisation's priority list. End users are increasingly concerned with the\nsafety of their personal data, so protecting it and letting clients know that\ntheir information is secure will drive value for any insurance firm.\n\n**Wim Geukens:** By blending different channels into a single experience,\ninsurers can maximise the value they create through digital innovation. They\ncan bridge the gap between customers and their teams and successfully manage\nmultiple journeys across channels throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\nThe key is to focus on the customers' end-to-end experience instead of\nindividual touchpoints and unify the Dynamics 365 CRM platform and omnichannel\nservicing capabilities. By orchestrating the various back-end systems,\ninsurers can avoid broken customer experiences and deliver outstanding unified\ncommunications instead.\n\n**What makes the combination of Microsoft technologies and partners such a\npowerful enabler for innovation in insurance firms?**\n\n**Amy Stokes-Waters:** Microsoft's focus on partner-led engagements means that\nit can keep its attention on developing great products while enabling partners\nto drive consumption of those technologies, widening their reach in terms of\nskills, and allowing partners to leverage additional technologies and provide\ncomplete end-to-end solutions for both digital transformation and security.\n\n**Wim Geukens:** Being in the Microsoft partner ecosystem allows us to get the\nhighest level of support when taking Microsoft's offerings to insurance\ncompanies. In turn, these companies accelerate their digital transformation\ntremendously.\n\nBy collaborating to win with Microsoft, VeriPark brings the full power of new\ntechnologies such as AI and ML to insurers in a much easier way. We empower\nthem to provide premium digital experiences to transform customer journeys\nthat were never imagined before and give insurers a perfect chance to impress\ntheir customers while differentiating themselves from the competition.\n\n**Edwin Benson:** The EY Insurance Nexus solution, built on key Microsoft\ntechnologies including Azure and Dynamics 365, gives insurers the capabilities\nthey need to quickly and \u00adcost-effectively bring new products to market - and\ndo so without having to incur the time and cost of building and implementing a\nnew on-premises technology suite.\n\n**Phil Fry:** Microsoft's partners have a wealth of expertise and\ntechnological capability that complement and augment the power of Microsoft\nsolutions such as Teams. With 25 years' experience of helping financial\nservices, and other industries, comply with regulatory requirements, Verint\nrecognised the new opportunities for service innovation, enabled by the\ncollaborative environment offered by Teams. At the same time, we were also\nacutely aware of the gap it opened between those capabilities and the need to\ncomply with increasingly stringent regulations governing communication capture\nand recording. Working in partnership with Microsoft, Verint has developed the\ncapabilities needed to bridge this gap and ensure that insurance, financial\nservices and other regulated businesses can exploit the power of Microsoft\nTeams and remain compliant with applicable regulations.\n\n**What is the most exciting area of innovation in insurance today?**\n\n**Wim Geukens:** In two words: connected insurance. Connected insurance is\nreshaping the industry, impacting the whole value chain. New IoT technologies\nsuch as connected cars, connected homes and wearables are being adopted by\ninsurers to evolve within an increasingly competitive marketplace. They\nprovide real-time, individualised data to insurers which can be used to offer\nproducts that suit their customers' lifestyles and values, to enhance\nunderwriting decisions and refine pricing.\n\nOur omnichannel delivery solution, VeriChannel, helps insurers unify and\nenhance customer data collection, using the growing number of devices that are\nlinked as part of IoT technology.\n\n**Amy Stokes-Waters:** The increased uptake of wearable technology will\ncertainly transform the health insurance industry beyond recognition, with\ncompanies such as Vitality already leading the charge. IoT is also set to play\na big part in areas such as home and car insurance, providing real-time data\nabout user behaviours to feed into risk-analysis on an individual basis.\n\n### Share this

And this idea of\nhelping others find their purpose came to co-founder Ketan Dewan not in any\nbrainstorming session but rather on a meditation break in 2011! When Ketan\ndeep dived into what drives him, he found that he was driven by helping\nsomeone find a job. He believed that there has to be an ecosystem such that if\nsomeone at 10\u2019o clock in the night decides to get a job, he should have an\noffer letter in his inbox in a few hours. That\u2019s how Talocity came to being in\n2015. Founded in 2015 by Ketan Dewan, Dilpreet Singh, and Rajat Suneja, the HR\ntech startup which uses AI for providing touchless hiring to recruiters is on\na purpose to enable employment for anyone willing to work.\n\nThe Gurugram based SaaS-based platform provides a one-way video interface to\ngauge the potential of existing employees\u2019 and future employees by generating\na personality report. Talocity provides English and domain Multiple Choice\nQuestions (MCQ) assessments and yields cognitive personality reports that\nsmoothly integrate the recording of employee data for the purpose of\nrecruitment and training, therefore making it a 90% touchless hiring system.\n\n### Video Interviews in 39 languages\n\nTo begin with, recruiters using Talocity punch the CVs which they have into\nthe engine. The engine sends an SMS, email, and IVR to the candidate with a\nvideo job description link. The candidate clicks on the link, watches the\nvideo JD, and if he likes the company, he applies through a one-way video\ninterview. The employer presets the questions for the interview and they can\nbe offered in 39 different languages of the world. This constitutes the direct\nway to source. One can also source through an indirect way wherein the\nrecruiter can paste a QR code on the organization\u2019s career site or LinkedIn or\nsocial site and people can apply through that route as well.\n\n![talocity](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1566449311/6._Candidate_Video_Interview_i5k0y5.png)\n\nFor the first time, you have to train the machine. The machine learns the\npersonality attributes of the candidates applying by capturing eyeball\nmovement, choice of words and tone and the system auto-generates a 48-word\nattribute personality report of the person, besides demographics inputs like\nskill rating, stability rating and relocation rating. So through this report,\nyou can benchmark people on the four key competencies which are critical for\nany person in today's world, which are learnability, flexibility,\ncollaboration, and coach-ability. If anyone possesses these four competencies,\nthat person is the ideal hire for a given company.\n\nA company can benchmark people against these competencies plus more. So the\nnext time, the machine will recognize which candidates are fit for hiring as\nper the company\u2019s standards-which means the recruiter does not have to meet\n80% of the people who anyway he won\u2019t hire.\n\n### 250,000 transactions, 2,000 recruiters\n\nUsed by more than 2,000 recruiters every day, the startup claims to have\ncrossed the 250,000 transaction mark. It is used across India and 25 other\ncountries across the world. People pay the startup for the bundle of\ntransactions-it\u2019s a perpetual license month on month and the companies pay\nbasis their usage. Ketan adds that the product offers almost an 80% cost\nbenefit to its users by bringing down the cost per hire. Currently, it claims\nto have around 27 paying customers such as YES Bank, MakeMyTrip, HDFC Life,\nInfosys, IFFCO, Synchrony, Bajaj Finserv, Sutherland, FWD, Aditya Birla and\nL&T Financial Services, and UrbanClap among others. The startup raised its\nfirst angel investment from Raj Bhatia in the 2016 and later raised another\nangel funding of over Rs 1 Cr.\n\n> Adds Ketan, \u201cThe transactions where human intervention is not required, are\n> handled by the machine. And wherever, the human touch is required, it is\n> handled by the humans-such as salary negotiations, candidate experience, and\n> on-boarding. So it is a perfect combination of touch by humans and touchless\n> by machines.\u201d\n\n### Differentiating through unstructured data\n\nWith the proliferation of AI-based recruiting startups, how does Talocity\ndifferentiate itself? Ketan reveals that most of the people are putting\napplied intelligence on keywords, which is structured data. What Talocity is\ndoing is pulling out data from unstructured environment basis a candidate's\neyeball movement, choice of words, and tone. The machine forms an opinion\nabout the candidate through the interaction. This opinion can be used in\nhiring, in training, in exit interviews, even in matrimonials-basically\nanywhere where two humans have to decide a match.\n\n![talocity](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1566449385/1._Dashboard_lg1xqj.png)\n\nWhen it comes to accuracy, the machine gives an outcome of the individual,\nwhich is 90-95% accurate and helps you shortlist the profile for success based\non your previous successful hires. Also, with the data set of 200-300\ninterviews, you get a 50%-60% accuracy. That accuracy can go as high as 85-90%\nwith 1500 data points. And this can happen in a span of mere four to five days\nin a volume hiring scenario.\n\nIt is on the back of this technology that the HR Tech startup is planning to\nmake a foray into the US market next year. Currently, it has a physical\npresence in India and the Philippines and in 25 countries product-wise. Also\non the anvil, are plans to raise another VC round to fund the US expansion and\nacquisition of one or two companies which have very interesting products and\ncan be integrated with Talocity\u2019s platform.\n\n### The right AI is not going to take away jobs\n\nAs like any other HR Tech startup in India, Talocity has had its share of\nchallenges. And one of them is battling the myth about AI and jobs.\n\n> Says Ketan, \"The right technology and the right AI is not going to take away\n> jobs and this is one misconception which should be removed around AI. It is\n> going to empower people. Tomorrow's recruiter is going to be a human\n> psychologist. You will have to upskill your teams on that. Recruiters will\n> get adept in managing the emotional quotient of people while machines will\n> handle all the transactions.\"\n\nHe also feels that Indian HR leaders should wake up to this reality.\nCurrently, you have three types of leaders in HR- first is the tech evangelist\nwho can understand and manage change in his organization and is super pepped\nabout technology. The second one is a tech evangelist but cannot manage\nchange-so they open up their doors to startups like Talocity, which enables\nthem to co-build the change. The third kind is the tech enthusiast who knows\nnothing about change management. These are people who do not understand the\nreal benefits of AI and are not very keen to drive real change in the\norganization.\n\n### Targeting an $8Bn recruitment market in India\n\nThe recruitment market in India is about $8Bn and in the US, it is about $120\nBn, as per Ketan. Globally it is about $700 Bn and very little of it is tech-\nenabled. As the number inches to a trillion dollars in the coming years, with\ngrowing tech implementation, the recruitment market is only going to go north\nfrom here. Which means startups like Talocity will have a much bigger pie to\nplay for. But this also means there will be increased competition from players\nsuch as Talview, Harver, Monjin, Impress.AI, Xobin, and others.\n\nKetan adds, \u201cAs individuals today, the amount of technology that we are\nembracing is growing at a breakneck pace. And I think it is going to translate\ninto technology adoption into the enterprise side as well. The only problem\nwhy adoption becomes challenging in India is everybody wants to do things\ntheir own way. That\u2019s why we created a template which can be tailored to\neveryone\u2019s requirements and kept everything DIY. This way we don\u2019t have to\nspend time and money on customization requests neither waste time to do things\naway from our roadmap.\u201d How smooth this road will be given the increasing\nnumber of players in the space will be something to watch out for.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"),\n[#WorkTech](/tag/worktech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=worktech \"Browse\nmore in: WorkTech\"),\n[#HRTech](/tag/hrtech?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hrtech \"Browse more\nin: HRTech\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

For over a century, registered brokers exchanged shouts, gestures\nand signals on the floor to make trades happen.\n\nThe National Stock Exchange (NSE) came up in 1994 to provide screen-based\nelectronic trading. It gave fibre-optic access to brokers in other cities who\ncould join the trading in the centralized exchange located in Mumbai. That\nended the era of disjointed stock exchanges.\n\nDematerialization of shares started in the late 1990s and online trading began\nat the turn of the millennium where investors could buy and sell shares\nthrough electronic brokers such as ICICI Direct and Sharekhan. More brokers\nwent online but another disruption was to come in the next decade.\n\nOnline financial services company Zerodha brought \u201cdiscount broking\" to India\nin 2010, applying a flat fee of \u20b920 on a trade whatever its size. It removed\neven that in December 2015, charging only for futures, options, and day\ntrading. This attracted newcomers and young investors who could do small\ncommission-free trades to get a feel of the market. Within a decade, Zerodha\novertook legacy players to become the country\u2019s largest brokerage in terms of\nnumber of trades, according to NSE data.\n\n**Simple advice**\n\nAlok Jain, who was one of the first brokers to become an NSE member from New\nDelhi in 1996, saw the writing on the wall when Zerodha started its flat fee\nmodel. The brokerage fee others were charging for investment advice and\nfacilitating trades were suddenly antediluvian. \u201cI could see that it would be\ndifficult for brokerages such as ours to stay in business,\" says Jain, an\nengineer from IIT with an MBA in finance from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe started his Weekend Investing blog in 2016 where he put up his entire\nportfolio of stocks, and posted details of his weekly trades. He soon built up\na following of investors who liked his portfolio and thesis of momentum\ninvesting. The \u201cMI50\" product he built for his own use gave returns of 54%\nwhen it completed a year on March 31, 2017, says Jain.\n\nThe popularity of his blog prompted him to register with Sebi as a financial\nadviser to provide portfolio management services to high net-worth individuals\n(HNIs). But his transition from broker to adviser wasn\u2019t complete.\n\nEven as exchanges and brokerages evolved, new investment instruments came up.\nThe country\u2019s first mutual fund, Unit Trust of India came up in 1963 and\nremained a monopoly until 1987 when other institutions were allowed to offer\nmutual funds. This became a mode for investors to take exposure in a basket of\nstocks managed by an expert instead of investing in individual stocks on their\nown.\n\nIts appeal was limited by hidden fees, lack of transparency, and no control\nfor the investor beyond entering and exiting the fund. Last year, a new\nportfolio investing instrument called \u2018smallcase\u2019 became available in India,\nwhich resides in the investor\u2019s trading account, thus providing control and\ntransparency.\n\nThis has enabled advisers like Jain to offer their portfolios as smallcases\nfor retail investors to buy with a subscription fee. Millennial professionals\ntypically have an appetite to invest but not the time to track and manage\ntheir portfolios. Such an instrument gives them that option.\n\nIt also ties in with another stock market trend, which is the growing share of\nalgorithmic investing and emerging influence of AI. It\u2019s getting harder for an\nordinary investor to keep up with new age investment experts who no longer\nneed armies of analysts when an AI engine can do all the crunching.\n\n**New investors**\n\nOne of these new investment advisers is Abhishek Banerjee, a computer science\nengineer who was a senior research analyst with Franklin Templeton. Last year,\nhe founded an investment advisory firm in Hyderabad, LotusDew, which uses AI-\nbased analytics and data points to create portfolios.\n\nBanerjee, who offers a couple of his portfolios to retail investors as\nsmallcases, likes the fact that the value proposition of these is upfront\nunlike a mutual fund. \u201cThere are 1,277 financial advisers registered with\nSebi. Most of them are not active, but of the ones that are active, very few\nhave their track record independently calculated and publicly available,\" says\nBanerjee.\n\nAs more and more elements of the stock market get digitized, it increases its\npotential to attract a new generation of investors who\u2019re no longer drawn to\nreal estate to park their disposable income.\n\n_Sumit Chakraberty is a consulting editor with Mint.

An accident report later reveals that\nfour small rectangles had been stuck to the face of the sign. These fooled the\ncar\u2019s onboard artificial intelligence (AI) into misreading the word \u2018stop\u2019 as\n\u2018speed limit 45\u2019.\n\nSuch an event hasn\u2019t actually happened, but the potential for sabotaging AI is\nvery real. Researchers have already demonstrated [how to fool an AI system\ninto misreading a stop sign](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945), by carefully\npositioning stickers on it1. They have [deceived facial-recognition\nsystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08705) by sticking a printed pattern on\nglasses or hats. And they have [tricked speech-recognition\nsystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05373) into hearing phantom phrases by\ninserting patterns of white noise in the audio.\n\nThese are just some examples of how easy it is to break the leading pattern-\nrecognition technology in AI, known as deep neural networks (DNNs). These have\nproved incredibly successful at correctly classifying all kinds of input,\nincluding images, speech and data on consumer preferences. They are part of\ndaily life, running everything from automated telephone systems to user\nrecommendations on the streaming service Netflix. Yet making alterations to\ninputs \u2014 in the form of tiny changes that are typically imperceptible to\nhumans \u2014 can flummox the best neural networks around.\n\nThese problems are more concerning than idiosyncratic quirks in a not-quite-\nperfect technology, says Dan Hendrycks, a PhD student in computer science at\nthe University of California, Berkeley. Like many scientists, he has come to\nsee them as the most striking illustration that DNNs are fundamentally\nbrittle: brilliant at what they do until, taken into unfamiliar territory,\nthey break in unpredictable ways.\n\n![](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-\nassets/d41586-019-03013-5/d41586-019-03013-5_17247076.png)\n\nSources: Stop sign: Ref. 1; Penguin: Ref. 5\n\nThat could lead to substantial problems. Deep-learning systems are\nincreasingly moving out of the lab into the real world, from [piloting self-\ndriving cars](https://www.nature.com/news/autonomous-vehicles-no-drivers-\nrequired-1.16832) to [mapping crime](https://www.nature.com/news/there-is-a-\nblind-spot-in-ai-research-1.20805) and [diagnosing\ndisease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02870-4). But pixels\nmaliciously added to medical scans could fool a DNN into wrongly detecting\ncancer, one study reported this year2. Another suggested that a hacker could\nuse these weaknesses to hijack an online AI-based system so that it runs the\ninvader\u2019s own algorithms3.\n\nIn their efforts to work out what\u2019s going wrong, researchers have discovered a\nlot about why DNNs fail. \u201cThere are no fixes for the fundamental brittleness\nof deep neural networks,\u201d argues Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an AI engineer at Google in\nMountain View, California. To move beyond the flaws, he and others say,\nresearchers need to augment pattern-matching DNNs with extra abilities: for\ninstance, making AIs that can explore the world for themselves, write their\nown code and retain memories. These kinds of system will, some experts think,\nform the story of the coming decade in AI research.\n\n## Reality check\n\nIn 2011, Google revealed a system that could recognize cats in YouTube videos,\nand soon after came [a wave of DNN-based classification\nsystems](https://www.nature.com/news/computer-science-the-learning-\nmachines-1.14481). \u201cEverybody was saying, \u2018Wow, this is amazing, computers are\nfinally able to understand the world,\u2019\u201d says Jeff Clune at the University of\nWyoming in Laramie, who is also a senior research manager at Uber AI Labs in\nSan Francisco, California.\n\nBut AI researchers knew that DNNs do not actually understand the world.\nLoosely modelled on the architecture of the brain, they are software\nstructures made up of large numbers of digital neurons arranged in many\nlayers. Each neuron is connected to others in layers above and below it.\n\nThe idea is that features of the raw input coming into the bottom layers \u2014\nsuch as pixels in an image \u2014 trigger some of those neurons, which then pass on\na signal to neurons in the layer above according to simple mathematical rules.\nTraining a DNN network involves exposing it to a massive collection of\nexamples, each time tweaking the way in which the neurons are connected so\nthat, eventually, the top layer gives the desired answer \u2014 such as always\ninterpreting a picture of a lion as a lion, even if the DNN hasn\u2019t seen that\npicture before.\n\nA first big reality check came in 2013, when Google researcher Christian\nSzegedy and his colleagues posted a preprint called \u2018Intriguing properties of\nneural networks\u20194. The team showed that it was possible to take an image \u2014 of\na lion, for example \u2014 that a DNN could identify and, by altering a few pixels,\nconvince the machine that it was looking at something different, such as a\nlibrary. The team called the doctored images \u2018adversarial examples\u2019.\n\n![](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-\nassets/d41586-019-03013-5/d41586-019-03013-5_17249554.png)\n\nA year later, Clune and his then-PhD student Anh Nguyen, together with Jason\nYosinski at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, showed that it was\npossible to make DNNs see things that were not there, such as a penguin in a\npattern of wavy lines5. \u201cAnybody who has played with machine learning knows\nthese systems make stupid mistakes once in a while,\u201d says Yoshua Bengio at the\nUniversity of Montreal in Canada, who is a pioneer of deep learning. \u201cWhat was\na surprise was the type of mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was pretty striking. It\u2019s\na type of mistake we would not have imagined would happen.\u201d\n\nNew types of mistake have come thick and fast. Last year, Nguyen, who is now\nat Auburn University in Alabama, showed that simply rotating objects in an\nimage was sufficient to throw off some of the best image classifiers around6.\nThis year, Hendrycks and his colleagues reported that even unadulterated,\nnatural images can still trick state-of-the-art classifiers into making\nunpredictable gaffes, such as identifying a mushroom as a pretzel or a\ndragonfly as a manhole cover7.\n\n![](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-\nassets/d41586-019-03013-5/d41586-019-03013-5_17249562.png)\n\nThe issue goes beyond object recognition: any AI that uses DNNs to classify\ninputs \u2014 such as speech \u2014 can be fooled. AIs that play games can be sabotaged:\nin 2017, computer scientist Sandy Huang, a PhD student at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, and her colleagues focused on DNNs that had been trained\nto beat Atari video games through a process called reinforcement learning8. In\nthis approach, an AI is given a goal and, in response to a range of inputs,\nlearns through trial and error what to do to reach that goal. It is the\ntechnology behind superhuman game-playing AIs such as\n[AlphaZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-\ngrand-games-chess-shogi-and-go) and the [poker bot\nPluribus](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02156-9). Even so,\nHuang\u2019s team was able to make their AIs lose games by adding one or two random\npixels to the screen.\n\nEarlier this year, AI PhD student Adam Gleave at the University of California,\nBerkeley, and his colleagues demonstrated that it is possible to introduce an\nagent to an AI\u2019s environment that acts out an \u2018adversarial policy\u2019 designed to\nconfuse the AI\u2019s responses9. For example, an AI footballer trained to kick a\nball past an AI goalkeeper in a simulated environment loses its ability to\nscore when the goalkeeper starts to behave in unexpected ways, such as\ncollapsing on the ground.\n\n![A simulated soccer penalty shootout between two Humanoid robots displayed\nwith and without a adversarial policy](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-\nassets/d41586-019-03013-5/d41586-019-03013-5_17239016.gif)\n\nAn AI footballer in a simulated penalty-shootout is confused when the AI\ngoalkeeper enacts an \u2018adversarial policy\u2019: falling to the floor\n(right).Credit: Adam Gleave/Ref. 9\n\nKnowing where a DNN\u2019s weak spots are could even let a hacker take over a\npowerful AI. One example of that came last year, when a team from Google\nshowed that it was possible to use adversarial examples not only to force a\nDNN to make specific mistakes, but also to reprogram it entirely \u2014 effectively\nrepurposing an AI trained on one task to do another3.\n\nMany neural networks, such as those that learn to understand language, can, in\nprinciple, be used to encode any other computer program. \u201cIn theory, you can\nturn a chatbot into whatever programme you want,\u201d says Clune. \u201cThis is where\nthe mind starts to boggle.\u201d He imagines a situation in the near future in\nwhich hackers could hijack neural nets in the cloud to run their own spambot-\ndodging algorithms.\n\nFor computer scientist Dawn Song at the University of California, Berkeley,\nDNNs are like sitting ducks. \u201cThere are so many different ways that you can\nattack a system,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd defence is very, very difficult.\u201d\n\n## With great power comes great fragility\n\nDNNs are powerful because their many layers mean they can pick up on patterns\nin many different features of an input when attempting to classify it. An AI\ntrained to recognize aircraft might find that features such as patches of\ncolour, texture or background are just as strong predictors as the things that\nwe would consider salient, such as wings. But this also means that a very\nsmall change in the input can tip it over into what the AI considers an\napparently different state.\n\nOne answer is simply to throw more data at the AI; in particular, to\nrepeatedly expose the AI to problematic cases and correct its errors. In this\nform of \u2018adversarial training\u2019, as one network learns to identify objects, a\nsecond tries to change the first network\u2019s inputs so that it makes mistakes.\nIn this way, adversarial examples become part of a DNN\u2019s training data.\n\nHendrycks and his colleagues have suggested quantifying a DNN\u2019s robustness\nagainst making errors by testing how it performs against a large range of\nadversarial examples. However, training a network to withstand one kind of\nattack [could weaken it against others](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08016),\nthey say. And researchers led by Pushmeet Kohli at Google DeepMind in London\nare [trying to inoculate DNNs against making\nmistakes](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/robust-and-verified-ai). Many\nadversarial attacks work by making tiny tweaks to the component parts of an\ninput \u2014 such as subtly altering the colour of pixels in an image \u2014 until this\ntips a DNN over into a misclassification. Kohli\u2019s team has suggested that a\nrobust DNN should not change its output as a result of small changes in its\ninput, and that this property might be mathematically incorporated into the\nnetwork, constraining how it learns.\n\nFor the moment, however, no one has a fix on the overall problem of brittle\nAIs. The root of the issue, says Bengio, is that DNNs don\u2019t have a good model\nof how to pick out what matters. When an AI sees a doctored image of a lion as\na library, a person still sees a lion because they have a mental model of the\nanimal that rests on a set of high-level features \u2014 ears, a tail, a mane and\nso on \u2014 that lets them abstract away from low-level arbitrary or incidental\ndetails. \u201cWe know from prior experience which features are the salient ones,\u201d\nsays Bengio. \u201cAnd that comes from a deep understanding of the structure of the\nworld.\u201d\n\nOne attempt to address this is to combine DNNs with symbolic AI, which was the\ndominant paradigm in AI before machine learning. With symbolic AI, machines\nreasoned using hard-coded rules about how the world worked, such as that it\ncontains discrete objects and that they are related to one another in various\nways. Some researchers, such as psychologist Gary Marcus at New York\nUniversity, say hybrid AI models are the way forward. \u201cDeep learning is so\nuseful in the short term that people have lost sight of the long term,\u201d says\nMarcus, who is a long-time critic of the current deep-learning approach. In\nMay, he co-founded a start-up called Robust AI in Palo Alto, California, which\naims to mix deep learning with rule-based AI techniques to develop robots that\ncan operate safely alongside people. Exactly what the company is working on\nremains under wraps.\n\nEven if rules can be embedded into DNNs, they are still only as good as the\ndata they learn from. Bengio says that AI agents need to learn in richer\nenvironments that they can explore. For example, most computer-vision systems\nfail to recognize that a can of beer is cylindrical because they were trained\non data sets of 2D images. That is why Nguyen and colleagues found it so easy\nto fool DNNs by presenting familiar objects from different perspectives.\nLearning in a 3D environment \u2014 real or simulated \u2014 will help.\n\nBut the way AIs do their learning also needs to change. \u201cLearning about\ncausality needs to be done by agents that do things in the world, that can\nexperiment and explore,\u201d says Bengio. Another deep-learning pioneer, J\u00fcrgen\nSchmidhuber at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research\nin Manno, Switzerland, thinks along similar lines. Pattern recognition is\nextremely powerful, he says \u2014 good enough to have made companies such as\nAlibaba, Tencent, Amazon, Facebook and Google the most valuable in the world.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a much bigger wave coming,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this will be about\nmachines that manipulate the world and create their own data through their own\nactions.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, AIs that use reinforcement learning to beat computer games are\ndoing this already in artificial environments: by trial and error, they\nmanipulate pixels on screen in allowed ways until they reach a goal. But real\nenvironments are much richer than the simulated or curated data sets on which\nmost DNNs train today.\n\n## Robots that improvise\n\nIn a laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, a robot arm\nrummages through clutter. It picks up a red bowl and uses it to nudge a blue\noven glove a couple of centimetres to the right. It drops the bowl and picks\nup an empty plastic spray bottle. Then it explores the heft and shape of a\npaperback book. Over several days of non-stop sifting, the robot starts to get\na feel for these alien objects and what it can do with them.\n\nThe robot arm is using deep learning to teach itself to use tools. Given a\ntray of objects, it picks up and looks at each in turn, seeing what happens\nwhen it moves them around and knocks one object into another.\n\n![Collection of clips of robots improvising with\ntools](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-\nassets/d41586-019-03013-5/d41586-019-03013-5_17239018.gif)\n\nRobots use deep learning to explore how to use 3D tools.Credit: Annie Xie\n\nWhen researchers give the robot a goal \u2014 for instance, presenting it with an\nimage of a nearly empty tray and specifying that the robot arrange objects to\nmatch that state \u2014 it improvises, and can work with objects it has not seen\nbefore, such as using a sponge to wipe objects off a table. It also figured\nout that clearing up using a plastic water bottle to knock objects out of the\nway is quicker than picking up those objects directly. \u201cCompared to other\nmachine-learning techniques, the generality of what it can accomplish\ncontinues to impress me,\u201d says Chelsea Finn, who worked at the Berkeley lab\nand is now [continuing that research](http://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) at\nStanford University in California.\n\nThis kind of learning gives an AI a much richer understanding of objects and\nthe world in general, says Finn. If you had seen a water bottle or a sponge\nonly in photographs, you might be able to recognize them in other images. But\nyou would not really understand what they were or what they could be used for.\n\u201cYour understanding of the world would be much shallower than if you could\nactually interact with them,\u201d she says.\n\nBut this learning is a slow process. In a simulated environment, an AI can\nrattle through examples at lightning speed. In 2017, AlphaZero, the latest\nversion of DeepMind\u2019s self-taught game-playing software, was trained to become\na superhuman player of Go, then chess and then shogi (a form of Japanese\nchess) in just over a day. In that time, it played more than 20 million\ntraining games of each event.\n\nAI robots can\u2019t learn this quickly. Almost all major results in deep learning\nhave relied heavily on large amounts of data, says Jeff Mahler, co-founder of\nAmbidextrous, an AI and robotics company in Berkeley, California. \u201cCollecting\ntens of millions of data points would cost years of continuous execution time\non a single robot.\u201d What\u2019s more, the data might not be reliable, because the\ncalibration of sensors can change over time and hardware can degrade.\n\nBecause of this, most robotics work that involves deep learning still uses\nsimulated environments to speed up the training. \u201cWhat you can learn depends\non how good the simulators are,\u201d says David Kent, a PhD student in robotics at\nthe Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Simulators are improving all\nthe time, and researchers are getting better at transferring lessons learnt in\nvirtual worlds over to the real. Such simulations are still no match for real-\nworld complexities, however.\n\nFinn argues that learning using robots is ultimately easier to scale up than\nlearning with artificial data. Her tool-using robot took a few days to learn a\nrelatively simple task, but it did not require heavy monitoring. \u201cYou just run\nthe robot and just kind of check in with it every once in a while,\u201d she says.\nShe imagines one day having lots of robots out in the world left to their own\ndevices, learning around the clock. This should be possible \u2014 after all, this\nis how people gain an understanding of the world. \u201cA baby doesn\u2019t learn by\ndownloading data from Facebook,\u201d says Schmidhuber.\n\n## Learning from less data\n\nA baby can also recognize new examples from just a few data points: even if\nthey have never seen a giraffe before, they can still learn to spot one after\nseeing it once or twice. Part of the reason this works so quickly is because\nthe baby has seen many other living things, if not giraffes, so is already\nfamiliar with their salient features.\n\nA catch-all term for granting these kinds of abilities to AIs is transfer\nlearning: the idea being to transfer the knowledge gained from previous rounds\nof training to another task. One way to do this is to reuse all or part of a\npre-trained network as the starting point when training for a new task. For\nexample, reusing parts of a DNN that has already been trained to identify one\ntype of animal \u2014 such as those layers that recognize basic body shape \u2014 could\ngive a new network the edge when learning to identify a giraffe.\n\nAn extreme form of transfer learning aims to train a new network by showing it\njust a handful of examples, and sometimes only one. Known as one-shot or few-\nshot learning, this relies heavily on pre-trained DNNs. Imagine you want to\nbuild a facial-recognition system that identifies people in a criminal\ndatabase. A quick way is to use a DNN that has already seen millions of faces\n(not necessarily those in the database) so that it has a good idea of salient\nfeatures, such as the shapes of noses and jaws. Now, when the network looks at\njust one instance of a new face, it can extract a useful feature set from that\nimage. It can then compare how similar that feature set is to those of single\nimages in the criminal database, and find the closest match.\n\nHaving a pre-trained memory of this kind can help AIs to recognize new\nexamples without needing to see lots of patterns, which could speed up\nlearning with robots. But such DNNs might still be at a loss when confronted\nwith anything too far from their experience. It\u2019s still not clear how much\nthese networks can generalize.\n\nEven the most successful AI systems such as DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero have an\nextremely narrow sphere of expertise. AlphaZero\u2019s algorithm can be trained to\nplay both Go and chess, but not both at once. Retraining a model\u2019s connections\nand responses so that it can win at chess resets any previous experience it\nhad of Go. \u201cIf you think about it from the perspective of a human, this is\nkind of ridiculous,\u201d says Finn. People don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve learnt so\neasily.\n\n## Learning how to learn\n\nAlphaZero\u2019s success at playing games wasn\u2019t just down to effective\nreinforcement learning, but also to an algorithm that helped it (using a\nvariant of a technique called Monte Carlo tree search) to narrow down its\nchoices from the possible next steps10. In other words, the AI was guided in\nhow best to learn from its environment. Chollet thinks that an important next\nstep in AI will be to give DNNs the ability to write their own such\nalgorithms, rather than using code provided by humans.\n\nSupplementing basic pattern-matching with reasoning abilities would make AIs\nbetter at dealing with inputs beyond their comfort zone, he argues. Computer\nscientists have for years studied program synthesis, in which a computer\ngenerates code automatically. Combining that field with deep learning could\nlead to systems with DNNs that are much closer to the abstract mental models\nthat humans use, Chollet thinks.\n\nIn robotics, for instance, computer scientist Kristen Grauman at Facebook AI\nResearch in Menlo Park, California, and the University of Texas at Austin is\nteaching robots how best to explore new environments for themselves. This can\ninvolve picking in which directions to look when presented with new scenes,\nfor instance, and which way to manipulate an object to best understand its\nshape or purpose. The idea is to get the AI to predict which new viewpoint or\nangle will give it the most useful new data to learn from.\n\nResearchers in the field say they are making progress in fixing deep\nlearning\u2019s flaws, but acknowledge that they\u2019re still groping for new\ntechniques to make the process less brittle. There is not much theory behind\ndeep learning, says Song. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s difficult to figure\nout why,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole field is still very empirical. You just have to\ntry things.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, although scientists recognize the brittleness of DNNs and\ntheir reliance on large amounts of data, most say that the technique is here\nto stay. The realization this decade that neural networks \u2014 allied with\nenormous computing resources \u2014 can be trained to recognize patterns so well\nremains a revelation. \u201cNo one really has any idea how to better it,\u201d says\nClune.\n\nNature **574** , 163-166 (2019)\n\ndoi: 10.1038/d41586-019-03013-5\n\n## References\n\n  1. 1.\n\nEykholt, K. _et al._ _IEEE/CVF Conf.

Taiwan Tech Startups Impress at\nCES 2020\n\n## Taiwan Tech Startups Impress at CES 2020\n\n#### __Article By : Matthew Burgess\n\n  * [__Category : CES](https://www.eetasia.com/category/ces/)\n  * __January 17, 2020\n  * __(0) Comments\n\n![](https://www.eetasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/images/0e918980-3729-4da2-9cd1-7ce68de89826.jpg?w=1024)\n\nMOST have announced another successful CES for Taiwan after taking a\ndelegation of 82 startups, winning 13 innovation awards and creating $226M in\nbusiness opportunities.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST),\nTaiwan Tech Arena (TTA) took a delegation of 82 startups to CES 2020, winning\n13 innovation awards.\n\nAs the third largest delegation in attendance at Eureka Park, Dr Chiou Chyou-\nHuey, the Director General of MOST\u2019s Department of Academia-Industry\nCollaboration and Science Park Affairs, expressed the importance of putting\nTaiwanese startups on the world stage. \u201cPeople are already aware of Taiwan\u2019s\nlarger companies such as TSMC, but smaller companies are often over-looked.\nCES is a great opportunity for us to display the breadth of talent we have\u201d.\n\nTaiwan remains a small market and many startups believe they must find\nopportunities overseas if they are to succeed. Working towards strengthening\nTaiwan\u2019s proposition, TTA has been participating in CES for the last three\nyears.\n\nOn the opening day of the show, a delegation from MOST held discussions with\nofficials from important startup nations. MOST\u2019s Deputy Minister Dr Yu-Chin\nHsu met with Minister Graham Stuart from the UK\u2019s Ministry of Investment and\nmade a consensus to enhance bilateral tech-startup cooperation. Additionally,\nthe MOST delegation also visited the Japanese and French pavilions, further\ninteracting with Eiko Okuya, Vice President from JETRO and Bertrand Velon,\nVice Director of Business France.\n\nMOST has reported that startups sent to CES 2020 by TTA have won more than\n$226M (USD) in potential business revenue, a 27% increase on CES 2019. When\nasked, Dr Chiou wasn\u2019t able to confirm what percentage of last years potential\nbusiness revenue had been converted but was buoyed by TTA\u2019s increasing\nsuccess.\n\nMinister Dr Chen Liang-Gee says, \u201cIn the first year, TTA startups were\nunfamiliar with CES. In the second year, the startups had understood the\nexhibition and made preparations to develop opportunities in the international\nmarket. This year, the startups have successfully linked with global\nindustries, sought business opportunities and enhanced the quality of their\nproducts and services. This has enabled our teams to receive global industry\nrecognition and increased the importance of Taiwan in the global startup\necosystem\u201d.\n\n![Nitin CES TTA](/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/25ca87b3-cb67-443c-a767-00a124c7531a.png)\n\n_Nitin Dahad, EE Times European correspondent at the TTA pavilion with Dr. Yu-\nChin Hsu, the Deputy Minister of MOST_\n\nAmong the high achievers at CES 2020 was Yallvend, a mobile payment platform\nwhich has won a contract to deploy its smart vending machine solution at the\nTokyo Olympics. In addition, AI startup FaceHeart has been invited by SONY to\njointly develop new healthcare products. Minister Chen said that it is\ninternational connections such as these which deepen Taiwan\u2019s strength in\ntechnology but also allows Taiwan to really compete in the international\nmarket.\n\nThe team at Yallvend emphatically supported the approach implemented by MOST\nand TTA to spread awareness of Taiwanese startups. \"The market, orders and\nexposure required for a startup can be obtained in a short period of time,\"\nsaid Helen Huang, business development manager of Yallvend. Yallvend recently\ndeveloped the function of digital identification combined with a vending\nmachine, so that products such as tobacco and alcohol that require age\nconfirmation can also be purchased on vending machines.\n\nThrough TTA\u2019s international brand and marketing strategy, Taiwan's startups\nhave attracted the attention of global industries and investors, strengthened\nconnections with the international ecosystem, and voiced for Taiwan with\ntechnology.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Twitter](https://www.eetasia.com/taiwan-tech-startups-impress-at-ces-2020/?share=twitter \"Click to

candidate is preparing for a job interview via video. They place themselves\nin front of the camera, try to stay engaged, and smile throughout the process.\n\nUnknown to the candidate, the interviewers are using software that analyses\neven the smallest of facial expressions.\n\nWhy? The technology is intended to cross-reference facial movements and body\nlanguage to determine how suitable the person is for the role. It is also\nmeant to deem how successful a candidate will be in the position.\n\nSlightly more unnerving, the software is supposed to detect when interviewees\nlie. Gone are the days then, of embellishing a resume or fabricating relevant\nexperience to impress employers.\n\nCalled \u2018emotion analytics\u2019, this form of AI is not a dystopian future, but a\nreality in both South Korea and the United States.\n\n### **The interview process**\n\nThe process can vary depending on the software but generally, the emotion\nanalytics test begins with applicants completing a 20-minute task consisting\nof neuroscience-based video games, with each decision revealing something\nabout their personality. Attitude towards risk features heavily in this\nsection, as employers can supposedly learn if the candidate is a potential\nliability.\n\nThis section is the first filtering of applicants based on their emotion\ncharacteristics. And what\u2019s concerning with the gamified element is that many\nolder candidates are unfamiliar with the format, meaning they are\nautomatically at a disadvantage in the selection process.\n\nThe next step is the video interview. Preset questions are answered via a call\non a mobile, tablet, or computer. AI technology then captures movements --\nboth voluntary and involuntary -- to assess the person\u2019s mood and traits.\n\nThe data from both steps is collected and reviewed, and a score is generated\nto reflect the candidates' level of 'employability' for the job and in\ncomparison to other applicants.\n\n### **Concerns over privacy and transparency**\n\nHireVue is a US-based organisation that claims to \u2018deliver the best talent,\nfaster with video interviews and AI-driven pre-hire assessments'.\n\nHireVue states that it uses proprietary machine-learning algorithms to collate\nnon-verbal clues including eye movements, clothing details, and voice nuances\nto make a representative profile of a candidate.\n\n> \"Businesses frequently fail to demonstrate that AI decision-making tools are\n> accurate, reliable, or necessary\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, however, HireVue faced fierce opposition from the\nElectronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). EPIC is a Washington DC public\ninterest research center focusing on privacy issues.\n\nIn a petition filed on February 3 to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), EPIC\nrequested fair trade practices around the commercial use of AI across a number\nof industries. In terms of recruitment, EPIC accuses HireVue of disregarding\nnational standards of fairness and transparency.\n\nIn the petition, EPIC [states](https://epic.org/privacy/ftc/ai/EPIC-FTC-AI-\nPetition.pdf) that \"businesses frequently fail to demonstrate that AI\ndecision-making tools are accurate, reliable, or necessary\u201d.\n\n_Editor 's note: after the publication of this article, a spokesperson for\nHireVue reached out to The Sociable with the following statement to clarify\nthat:_\n\n\"HireVue\u2019s assessments have never 'read emotions', attempt to 'guess' at the\ninner states of candidates or read body language, but focus exclusively on\njob-related skills and competencies identified and supported through a\ndetailed job analysis and well-designed interview questions that reduce the\nsignificant impact of human biases\".\n\n### **Companies using AI emotion analytics**\n\n![](https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1.jpeg)Unilever uses\nemotion analytics (Photo source: LinkedIn)\n\nUnilever, Dunkin Donuts, and IBM are just a few of the large corporations\nutilising emotion analytics. At Unilever, AI recruitment tech is reported to\nhave saved the consumer goods company [50,000\nhours](https://www.ft.com/content/e2e85644-05be-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) worth\nof hiring work in 2019.\n\nCurrently, the tech is mostly used for online applications to entry-level jobs\n-- perhaps suggesting that these positions attract less-trustworthy\ncandidates. Or instead, highlighting that the tech is not yet credible enough\nto be applied to high-level roles.\n\nOverall, the emotion analytics industry is already set to be worth [$25\nbillion](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/02/21/emotion-analytics-a-\ndystopian-technology/) by 2025.\n\n### **\u2018No scientific basis\u2019**\n\n![](https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2.png)AI Now Institute has\ncalled to ban emotion analytics (Photo source: LinkedIn)\n\nElsewhere, research institute AI Now released [a\nreport](https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2019_Report.pdf) in December last\nyear stating that emotion analytics has no scientific basis and should be\nbanned from influencing decisions about people\u2019s livelihoods.\n\nThe report calls for businesses and governments to ban emotion analytics\ntechnology until a more in-depth study of the risks involved has been\nconducted. AI Now went further still to condemn the \u201csystemic racism,\nmisogyny, and lack of diversity\u201d in the AI industry as a whole.\n\nOther issues arise when taking into account that humans transmit an immense\nvolume of information when expressing themselves. Emotion analytics focus on\nan incredibly small and limited part of this information, mostly stemming from\nthe face.\n\n> \"Emotion analytics focus on an incredibly small and limited part of this\n> information, mostly stemming from the face\"\n\nA [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/SAUES8UM69EN8TSMUGF9/full) by\npsychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett, recently argued that a configuration of\nfacial movements can communicate something other than an emotional state.\nBarrett advocates that much more research is needed into how people move their\nface to express emotion and other social information.\n\nNot to mention, Barrett believes there is a severe need for greater scrutiny\nof the mechanisms used to perceive instances of emotion in fellow humans.\n\nThe results generated by emotion analytics then are merely an estimation of an\nindividual\u2019s emotions as perceived by a machine and then mediated to other\n(potentially untrained) people. The process of translation is not direct, and\nnor does it connect with any real sense of human experience.\n\nThe HireVue spokesperson added, \"We agree and support Dr. Barret\u2019s\nobservations well as the referenced research\".\n\n![](https://sociable.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Depositphotos_170582414_s-2019-375x250.jpg)Psychologists\nhave said there is a severe need for greater scrutiny of the mechanisms used\nto perceive emotion in humans.\n\n### **Potential to manipulate the tech**\n\nAs more and more companies incorporate emotion analytics into their hiring\nprocess, and job-seekers begin to prepare for interviews with an algorithm,\nanother worry has surfaced. Is it possible to cheat the technology?\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, facial recognition expert Paul Ekman\n[remarked](https://www.ft.com/content/e2e85644-05be-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) on\npeople\u2019s ability to manipulate their emotions. He claimed that if people know\nthey\u2019re being observed, they\u2019re more self-conscious and can change their\nbehaviour. Especially in a competitive environment like an interview, people\nare likely to want to change their emotions to secure the job.\n\n> \"If people know they\u2019re being observed, they\u2019re more self-conscious and can\n> change their behaviour\"\n\nThe irony then, is that if applicants can learn to trick emotion analytics\u2019\nsystems (which is certainly possible considering the model is yet to be\nscientifically proven), employers would actively be recruiting a dishonest\nworkforce.\n\nNonetheless, because of the short-term benefits of emotion analytics -- a\nfaster, streamlined hiring process, and an increase in the number of new hires\n-- the technology looks set to stay in recruitment for the foreseeable future.\n\n> [Facial recognition is the new polygraph test for\n> insurers](https://sociable.co/technology/facial-recognition-is-the-new-\n> polygraph-test-for-insurers/)\n\n_**Article updated on March 2 to include the statements from the HireVue\nspokesperson.**_\n\nTags :[AI](https://sociable.co/tag/ai/ \"AI\")[emotion\nanalytics](https://sociable.co/tag/emotion-analytics/ \"emotion\nanalytics\")[recruitment](https://sociable.co/tag/recruitment/ \"recruitment\")\n\n[ __share on\nFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsociable.co%2Ftechnology%2Femotion-\nanalytics-ai-recruitment-tools-incorrect%2F)[ __share on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Emotion+analytics+used+in+AI+recruitment+tools+are+not+only+unethical+but+incorrect&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsociable.co%2Ftechnology%2Femotion-\nanalytics-ai-recruitment-tools-incorrect%2F&via=thesociable)\n\n __show 1 comment\n\n###  __1 Comment\n\n  1. **[Is Use of Emotion Analytics for Recruitment Processes Ethical?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/use-emotion-analytics-recruitment-processes-ethical/)** says:\n\n[ March 4, 2020 at 3:45 AM  ](https://sociable.co/technology/emotion-\nanalytics-ai-recruitment-tools-incorrect/#comment-502508)\n\n[\u2026] to a report, the process can vary depending on the software but generally,\nthe emotion analytics test begins [\u2026]\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Response [Cancel reply](/technology/emotion-analytics-ai-\nrecruitment-tools-incorrect/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\n\nNotify me of new posts by email.\n\n![Grace Brennan](https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grace-\nBrennan-375x378.png)\n\n[\n\n### Grace Brennan\n\n](https://sociable.co/author/grace-brennan/)\n\nGrace is a writer from the UK, interested in the changing relationship between\ntechnology and humans.

According to Greek mythology,\n[Talos](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Talos/talos.html) was a\ngiant automaton made of bronze, created by the god Hephaestus, for the purpose\nof guarding the island of Crete by throwing stones at passing ships.\n\n## 1769: The Turk\n\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/turk.jpg)\n\nThe first chess playing AI system turned out to be a lie\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/US_public-Domaini.png)\n\nJust as many experts in AI today accuse companies of claiming to have AI when\nin fact they don\u2019t, the second well known example of AI was a lie. [The\nTurk](https://interestingengineering.com/the-turk-fake-automaton-chess-player)\nwas supposed to be a mechanical device for playing chess, created by Wolfgang\nvon Kempelen, trying to impress Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769. The\nTurk even played against Napoleon Bonaparte and won. But in fact it was a\nhoax. A human chess master sat inside the machine, controlling it.\n\n## 1830s: Babbage computer\n\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BABBAGE.jpg)\n\nCharles Babbage, if not the history of AI, then at least the history of\ncomputers, began with him\n\nIn the 1830s, Charles Babbage created a design for the Analytical Engine. The\nproduct was finally built 153 years later. It wasn\u2019t a design for an AI\nmachine, of course, but today is considered to be the forerunner of the\ndigital computer.\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_53296403-e1567431098279-923x440-2-150x150.jpeg)What\n> is AI?

Bush believed that the big hope for humanity lied in\nsupporting greater knowledge, rather than information.\n\n## 1947: The transistor\n\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_109369584.jpeg)\n\nIt looks different today, but without the invention of the transistor, the\nhistory of AI would have got stuck on square one\n\nJohn Bardeen and Walter Brattain, with support from colleague William\nShockley,  \ndemonstrate the transistor at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey.\n\n## 1950: The Turing Test\n\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_137943222.jpeg)\n\nLONDON, UK - FEBRUARY 16TH 2017: A blue plaque on Warrington Cresent in the\nMaida Vale area of London, marking the location where famous Code-breaker Alan\nTuring was born, taken on 16th February 2017.\n\nAlan Turing proposes a test for ascertaining whether a computer can think like\na human. In that year he published a paper: \u2018Computing Machinery and\nIntelligence.\u2019 Turing test was based on the imitation game in which a judge\nquestions a human and a computer in different rooms, communicating by keyboard\nand monitor. The judge has to identify which of the two is human. This has\nbecome known as \u2018[The Turing\nTest](https://www.turing.org.uk/scrapbook/test.html).\u2019\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_214192964-1013x440-1-1-150x150.jpeg)Is\n> artificial general intelligence possible?

You have no ability to build a\nrapport with a machine and this can really throw people.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Bristol graduate Joshua Pauk is one of these people. He told\n_The Telegraph,_ \u201cyou\u2019re just talking into a blank screen, it\u2019s really\nunnerving.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old found when applying for banking graduate schemes recently,\naround 10 different companies required him to record interviews in this manner\nusing his webcam.\n\n\u201cThey ask very traditional interview questions, like why do you want to work\nhere, and what are your strengths and weaknesses.\u201d\n\n### **What\u2019s its purpose?**\n\nIt all sounds a little odd, but it could save companies _a lot_ of time\nsifting through applications.\n\nUsually, the AI interviews are used near the beginning of the application\nprocess to weed out the weaker applicants and make it easier for employers to\nconsider the smaller selection who make it past the software for in-person\ninterviews or trials.\n\n> Your next interview may be with an AI robot watching your face\u2019s every move.\n> <https://t.co/QuKFWmJ6JB>\n> [pic.twitter.com/60fE9ytUbw](https://t.co/60fE9ytUbw)\n>\n> -- CNBC (@CNBC) [April 24,\n> 2018](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/988590849675223040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\u201cYour answers are being analysed against a set of quality and criteria\ndetermined by the employer,\u201d Walker explained.\n\n\u201cIt is more sophisticated than throwing in certain words. It can be the\nability to articulate in a concise way, there can be an assessment of body\nlanguage,\" he continued, explaining companies may have desired qualities in\ncandidates which often can be built from current employee\u2019s profiles and then\nsought after through the AI software.\n\nUsing technology in this manner not only saves on costs and time but also\noften presents companies with a wider range of applicants than they may\nusually look at by removing \u201cunconscious bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason most companies give as a reason for doing this is that it improves\nthe diversity of applicants,\u201d Walker claimed.\n\n> 4 Ways AI is Changing the Interview Process <https://t.co/d677nXhj1Z>\n> [#working](https://twitter.com/hashtag/working?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [pic.twitter.com/OAyfaAkLS5](https://t.co/OAyfaAkLS5)\n>\n> -- CareerMetis.com (@CareerMetis) [April 19,\n> 2018](https://twitter.com/CareerMetis/status/987109608329236483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n### **Where did it come from?**\n\n_The Telegraph_ reported many of the companies use AI interview technology\ndeveloped by US firm HireVue which was \u201cset up 13 years ago by a university\nstudent who couldn\u2019t get an interview and couldn\u2019t get a job,\u201d HireVue\u2019s\nChairman and CEO Kevin Parke said.\n\nThe student \"wanted to democratise interviews to make the process fairer and\nmore consistent\u201d after he was unable to get an interview for his dream\ngraduate job at Goldman Sachs as employers didn\u2019t visit his college campus,\nParke added.\n\n\u201cNow Goldman Sachs are one of our biggest clients,\u201d Parke said, and HireVue's\nsoftware is used for hiring in prestigious companies near and far.\n\n**Liked this?

It\u2019s still texting.\n\nIn fact, 89% of consumers would like to use messaging to connect with\nbusinesses\n([PDF](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2fcg2lkzxw1t/5l4ljDXMvSKkqiU64akoOW/cab0836a76d892bb4a654a4dbd16d4e6/Twilio_-\n_Messaging_Consumer_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf)). They expect more than just\ngeneric mass texts or one-way communication from businesses, they want to\nengage in conversations right away.\n\nGone are the days of waiting; in today\u2019s world of immediacy, chatbots have\ntaken off.\n\n\\- Advertisement -\n\n **Here are five chatbots in Singapore that you can talk to:**\n\n## **1.Want a job at DBS Bank? Meet JIM.**\n\nJobs Intelligence Maestro, or JIM for short, was created by DBS Bank\u2019s Talent\nAcquisition team and impress.ai to help the bank efficiently hire 40% more\nwealth planning managers. Once candidates submit their job application, they\nare greeted by JIM, who proceeds to engage, interview, and shortlist\ncandidates. After an interview is completed, JIM informs candidates about next\nsteps and answers their questions in real-time.\n\n## **2.SMU student with a question? Say hi to AskSmooSmoo.**\n\nSingapore Management University is the first institution of higher education\nin Singapore to launch a chatbot in the Student Services Hub, a one-stop\ncenter for services like payments, insurance, and locker rentals. AskSmooSmoo\nworks 24/7 to answer frequently asked questions about academics, admissions,\nstudent life, internships, exchanges, and share career tips.\n\n**Also read:[4 made-in-Singapore chatbots that can raise your company\u2019s\nproductivity](https://e27.co/four-business-chatbots-made-in-\nsingapore-20180403/)**\n\n## **3\\. Wondering what to do about your taxes? Just Ask Jamie.**\n\nThe government uses a chatbot to engage citizens. Ask Jamie is a virtual\nassistant implemented on agency websites where the public can chat to find\nanswers. Ask Jamie can be trained to ask follow-up questions to narrow down\nappropriate answers before sharing the most relevant response with end-users.\n\n## **4\\. Want to check the status of your flight? Chat with Kris.**\n\nSingapore Airlines uses a chatbot to answer customer questions on their\nFacebook page. Customers can receive information around the clock to check the\nstatus of their flights, confirm baggage allowance, select seats, check-in,\nand information about their booking.\n\n## **5\\. Need some company for your long commute? There\u2019s Bus Uncle.**\n\nBus Uncle delivers real-time information about bus arrival timings, whether\nthe bus is a double decker, how crowded it is, and even allows passengers to\ntrack the bus.\n\n## **What does the rise of chatbots mean?**\n\nIn an on-demand world, where everything seems to be just a click away,\nconsumers expect access to information quickly and easily. Unlike employees,\nchatbots provide 24/7 service and instant responses, which is especially\nuseful in times of urgency or when there is a high volume of questions from\ncustomers.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that chatbots are poised to replace employees.\nBecause when it comes to receiving detailed responses from experts, solving\ntechnical issues, or providing next-level service in terms of overall\nfriendliness and approachability, these are areas where humans will continue\nto shine.\n\nAs chatbots are increasingly adopted across businesses, schools, and\ngovernments, they will help bridge the gap between communication channels as\nwell as provide an improved online experience for end-users.\n\n---\n\n**e27** publishes relevant guest contributions from the community.

McGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/author/joline-mcgoldrick/)\n__19 Feb 2020 __[Guest Authors](https://www.aithority.com/category/guest-\nauthors/) __[1 Comment](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/ai-is-\nchanging-how-brands-develop-creative-heres-what-the-future-is-looking-\nlike/#comments) __694 Views\n\nFor most of advertising\u2019s history, advertisers have produced their messaging\nprimarily based on the gut instincts of their creative teams. Sure, we\u2019ve\nalways had surveys and market research to provide loose guidance on the\ndemographics and preferences of our potential customers. But until recently,\nthe end result has always been a single, one-size-fits-all ad that succeeds or\nfails based on the creativity and the guesswork of the people who produced it.\n\nWith the development of [digital\nadvertising](https://www.aithority.com//?s=digital%20advertising) technology,\nthis has all started to change. In recent years, advertisers have begun\ncombining Human intuition with [Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.aithority.com//?s=artificial%20intelligence) to\nproduce some of the most powerful ads we\u2019ve seen yet. Today, many of the\nworld\u2019s leading brands are using [customer\ndata](https://www.aithority.com//?s=customer%20data) and powerful [Machine\nLearning](https://www.aithority.com//?s=Machine%20Learning) algorithms to\ninform smarter creative choices, and sometimes even to produce parts of the ad\nitself.\n\nFar from removing creativity from advertising, AI is helping brands deliver\neffectively, evocative ads, tailored to the unique wants and needs of each\ncustomer. And its impact on digital advertising is only getting stronger.\n\n _ **Read more:**_[What Will 2020 Bring for Digital Advertising?\n](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/what-will-2020-bring-for-digital-\nadvertising/ \"What Will 2020 Bring for Digital Advertising?\")\n\n### **The Future is Now**\n\nAt its simplest, Artificial Intelligence is any technology that allows\nmachines to perform [Human\nIntelligence](https://www.aithority.com//?s=Human%20Intelligence) tasks as\nwell as, or better than humans, at greater scale and lower cost. Through\nMachine Learning, these AI tools are often able to learn from their results,\ncreating a feedback loop that allows them to make smarter decisions over time.\n\nAlready, AI is helping brands develop a number of creative, engaging\nadvertising experiences. For instance, the fitness chain Orangetheory used an\nAI breakdown of its audience\u2019s online browsing habits to learn that its\ncustomers frequently gravitated to the chain via ads on college sports content\nand music platforms, rather than health and wellness sites. Orangetheory then\napplied this information by producing video ads that [linked the gym to the\naudience\u2019s hobbies outside of it](https://digiday.com/marketing/high-end-gym-\nchain-orangetheory-cut-cost-per-lead-half-using-artificial-intelligence/).\n\nMeanwhile, other brands are using AI to edit and optimize their ads while\ntheir campaigns are ongoing. At [VidMob](https://www.vidmob.com/), where I\nserve as Senior Vice President of Data Insights and Research, we use AI to\nevaluate how different aspects of an ad are driving advertising success (e.g.\nIs a nature scene more engaging than an urban landscape?), and then use the\ninsights to optimize the campaign\u2019s creative via our network of designers.\nThrough creative versioning tools like ours, companies like AB InBev are using\nAI to pursue the most effective ad for every campaign.\n\nThe future may even see AI-powered ad messages inserted into entertainment\ncontent in real-time. The Chinese video site Tencent is [testing a new\nfeature](https://www.mirriad.com/mirriad-partners-with-tencent-one-of-the-\nworlds-largest-video-platforms/) that would allow advertisers to serve\npersonalized ads as native product placements while people are watching its\nshows. For instance, if an on-screen character is waiting for the bus, a brand\ncould cover the bus stop with an ad relevant to the viewer\u2019s interests.\n\n###  **Through Our Powers Combined\u2026**\n\nToo often, those of us in the ad industry get the wrong impression about the\nimpact of AI on our field. While some see AI as eventually replacing human\ncreatives and strategists, the truth is that this is unlikely to happen at any\nsort of scale.\n\nCertainly, ad agencies have released a few [pieces of video\ncontent](http://saatchi.com/en-us/news/saatchi-saatchi-commission-an-\nexperiment-to-test-the-creative-ability-of-artificial-intelligence-/) created\nentirely by AI, but these have largely been experiments designed to push\ncreative boundaries and impress awards show judges. A more likely outcome is\nthat brands will use increasingly effective AI technology to free their human\nstaff from the rote grunt work of data analysis and campaign optimization,\ngiving them more time for creative conception, campaign strategy, and other\nmore interesting tasks.\n\nIndeed, the future of advertising isn\u2019t a robot takeover\u2014it\u2019s a creative,\nefficient and effective collaboration between Artificial and Human\nIntelligence.\n\n _ **Read more:**_[Seizing Artificial Intelligence\u2019s Opportunities in the\n2020s ](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/seizing-artificial-\nintelligence-opportunities-in-the-2020s/ \"Seizing Artificial Intelligence\u2019s\nOpportunities in the 2020s\")\n\n[Advertising](https://www.aithority.com/tag/advertising/)\n[AI](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ai/) [Customer\nData](https://www.aithority.com/tag/customer-data/) [Digital\nadvertising](https://www.aithority.com/tag/digital-advertising/) [human\nintelligence](https://www.aithority.com/tag/human-intelligence/) [Joline\nMcGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/tag/joline-mcgoldrick/) [video\ncontent](https://www.aithority.com/tag/video-content/)\n[VidMob](https://www.aithority.com/tag/vidmob/) 2020-02-19\n\n**[Joline McGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/author/joline-mcgoldrick/\n\"Posts by Joline McGoldrick\") **\n\nTags [Advertising](https://www.aithority.com/tag/advertising/)\n[AI](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ai/) [Customer\nData](https://www.aithority.com/tag/customer-data/) [Digital\nadvertising](https://www.aithority.com/tag/digital-advertising/) [human\nintelligence](https://www.aithority.com/tag/human-intelligence/) [Joline\nMcGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/tag/joline-mcgoldrick/) [video\ncontent](https://www.aithority.com/tag/video-content/)\n[VidMob](https://www.aithority.com/tag/vidmob/)\n\n[__ Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=https://www.aithority.com/guest-\nauthors/ai-is-changing-how-brands-develop-creative-heres-what-the-future-is-\nlooking-like/\n\"AI+Is+Changing+How+Brands+Develop+Creative+%26%238211%3B+Here%E2%80%99s+What+the+Future+Is+Looking+Like\")\n[__\nFacebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.aithority.com/guest-\nauthors/ai-is-changing-how-brands-develop-creative-heres-what-the-future-is-\nlooking-like/) [__ Google\n+](https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=https://www.aithority.com/guest-\nauthors/ai-is-changing-how-brands-develop-creative-heres-what-the-future-is-\nlooking-like/) [__\nlinkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.aithority.com/guest-\nauthors/ai-is-changing-how-brands-develop-creative-heres-what-the-future-is-\nlooking-like/ \"AI Is Changing How Brands Develop Creative \u2013 Here\u2019s What the\nFuture Is Looking Like\") More\n\n###  Authors\n\n![Joline McGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/joline-150x150.png)\n\nPosted by : [Joline McGoldrick](https://www.aithority.com/author/joline-\nmcgoldrick/ \"Posts by Joline McGoldrick\")\n\nJoline McGoldrick is the Senior Vice President, Data Insights and Research,\nVidMob.

Corporate bosses like to think that finding customised AI solutions is\njust as easy as selecting a fizzy drink with a hint of grapefruit. They are\nwrong. Buying AI takes time, can feel like hard work, and the results are\noften imperfect.\n\nA number of vendors are scurrying to come to would-be users\u2019 aid. The leaders\nare the West\u2019s biggest providers of cloud storage: Amazon, Google and\nMicrosoft. Cloud computing is a vast market worth $300bn, and fiercely\ncompetitive. All three firms offer pre-trained models that corporate clients\ncan use to build AI-enabled systems. For example, they all sell \u201cvision\u201d tools\nthat enable customers to use computer vision to improve their existing\nservices and build new ones. Uber, the ride-hailing firm, worked with\nMicrosoft\u2019s toolset to design a system that scans drivers\u2019 faces to confirm\ntheir identity when they start a shift. C-Span, a television network, used\nAmazon\u2019s vision system to compile a database of politicians so it can quickly\nname them when they appear on screen.\n\nA broad range of tools is available to help mainstream companies build\nanything from search and recommendation engines to speech-recognition and\ntranslation systems, customer-service bots and more. Jeff Dean, director of\nGoogle Brain, the search giant\u2019s AI-research arm, reckons there are 10m\norganisations in the world that \u201chave a problem that would be amenable to a\nmachine-learning solution. They have the data but don\u2019t have the experts on\nstaff.\u201d\n\nThe potential corporate market for AI software, hardware and services is vast:\naround $58bn by 2021, compared with $12bn last year, according to IDC, a\nresearch firm. Amazon has a clear lead in the broader cloud market, with a 44%\nshare of the total, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 7% and Google\u2019s 2.3%, but for AI\ntools the field remains wide open. Paul Clarke, chief technology officer of\nOcado, an online grocer, says it can be good for clients to be promiscuous and\nuse the best tools from each. He thinks it unlikely that any one of them will\nsweep the board.\n\nCloud providers try to differentiate their AI offerings in two ways: by ease\nof use, through a well-designed interface, and by offering better algorithms.\nEach of the tech giants draws on where its \u201cstrength is today\u201d, says Joseph\nSirosh of Microsoft. For example, Google offers an excellent tool which\ncompanies can use to create or redesign their own search engines, and has\nespecially good engineering talent. Microsoft and Amazon have solid tools for\nvoice recognition. Microsoft\u2019s interface currently has the best design, says\nPedro Domingos, a professor of computer science at the University of\nWashington and author of \u201cThe Master Algorithm\u201d, a book about AI and business.\n\nIn future tech firms will develop more specialised hardware that will help\ncompanies crunch enormous data piles more quickly. Google has a lead in this\narea; it has built some remarkably powerful custom chips, called Tensor\nProcessing Units (TPUs), and uses other customised accelerators to increase\nthe processing speed of its data centres. The tech firms are also offering\nfree open-source libraries to clients\u2019 machine-learning experts that can be\nused to design AI-enabled programs. This is \u201cnot altruistic\u201d, says Matt Turck\nof FirstMark Capital, a venture investor. Tech firms want to provide great\ntools in order to attract clients to their platforms and impress AI experts.\n\nMicrosoft has more experience than either Amazon or Google of catering to\nlarge firms\u2019 software needs, so it is well placed to serve mainstream\ncompanies in need of help with AI. But most such offerings still require a lot\nof customisation and technical work to make them useful, says Oren Etzioni of\nthe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a non-profit research group.\n\nThe cloud providers are trying to fill the gap by offering consulting\nservices. Google has opened an \u201cAdvanced Solutions Lab\u201d that is part\nconsulting service, part tech bootcamp. Whole teams from client companies can\ncome to acquire machine-learning skills and build customised systems alongside\nGoogle engineers. Courses typically last from four weeks to several months.\nDemand has been \u201coverwhelming\u201d, says Vats Srivatsan of Google Cloud, who is\nnow hoping to roll this out much more widely. That is a new departure for tech\nfirms, which in the past have been strong on technical infrastructure but\nlight on people.\n\nThe cloud providers will increasingly compete with management consultancies,\nwhich charge fat fees for helping clients navigate technological disruption.\n\u201cThe Googles, Amazons and Microsofts of the world may take over from the\nMcKinseys, Boston Consulting Groups and Bains,\u201d says Roy Bahat of Bloomberg\nBeta, a venture-capital firm. \u201cConsultancies are built for two-by-two\nmatrices. AI\u2019s matrices are a million by a million.\u201d In this race,\nconsultancies with deep expertise in data and technology are better placed\nthan those that focus on general strategy.\n\n## Straight from the horse\u2019s mouth\n\nThe generalists know they are vulnerable. McKinsey has been investing heavily\nto beef up its expertise in data, for example by buying QuantumBlack, an\nadvanced-analytics firm, for an undisclosed sum in 2015. But many clients seek\nadvice direct from tech firms, which are themselves pioneering users of AI.\n\u201cAll consultants do is listen to you and tell you back what you\u2019ve already\ntold them,\u201d says Morag Watson of BP, an oil giant.\n\nIBM is trying to bridge the gap between the tech wizards and the conventional\nconsultants. \u201cPeople think this will go the way the digital and mobile\nrevolutions went. I would argue the opposite. If people get their AI right,\nit\u2019s a great way to extend their incumbent advantage,\u201d says David Kenny, the\nboss of Watson, IBM\u2019s AI offering. Watson has been heavily marketed on\ntelevision and enjoys strong name recognition, aided by its victory over human\ncontestants in a game of Jeopardy in 2011. But its bespoke solutions for\nclients take lots of time to develop, running up hefty bills for consulting\nhours. \u201cWatson is a branding concept that\u2019s being portrayed as a product,\u201d\nsays Tom Siebel of C3 IOT, an AI startup. \u201cYou can\u2019t easily buy it, and you\ncan\u2019t install it.\u201d\n\nIBM also suffers from the same problem as any tech firm other than Google,\nAmazon and Microsoft: it finds it hard to get hold of the best talent. None of\nthe top doctoral candidates in AI goes to work for IBM, says Mr Domingos of\nthe University of Washington. The old saying that \u201cnobody ever got fired for\nbuying IBM\u201d may no longer apply in the AI era.\n\nStartups, too, are hoping to jump on the AI bandwagon. Many offer services\nlike helping clean up and label data, and take on specific tasks that large\ntech firms are not yet offering, like helping firms recruit, scan job\ndescriptions and improve customer service. For large companies it makes sense\nto outsource most of their AI work, except where it directly affects their\nstrategic edge. For example, BP would not want to build AI tools to automate\nback-office or HR functions, but it would want to develop its own AI system\nfor interpreting seismic imaging to detect oil, says Ms Watson.\n\nIf companies want to get products rolled out quickly, they have to work with\nmultiple vendors, says Mr Lippert of MetLife. That may be good for startups,\nwhich can be nimble. But the incumbent tech firms\u2019 size, computing\ninfrastructure, proprietary data and balance-sheets give them an unassailable\nadvantage. \u201cRight now everyone thinks they can win. The field will become\nconsiderably less democratic,\u201d predicts Martin Reeves of Boston Consulting\nGroup. Having used AI to boost their own fortunes, the incumbents will move on\nto selling the technology to customers who may become AI-fuelled giants in\ntheir own right.\n\n **GrAIt expectations AI in business**\n\n  * [Non-tech businesses are beginning to use artificial intelligence at scale](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/non-tech-businesses-are-beginning-to-use-artificial-intelligence-at-scale)\n  * [How AI is spreading throughout the supply chain](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/how-ai-is-spreading-throughout-the-supply-chain)\n  * [Customer service could start living up to its name](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/customer-service-could-start-living-up-to-its-name)\n  * [Managing human resources is about to become easier](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/managing-human-resources-is-about-to-become-easier)\n  * [There will be little privacy in the workplace of the future](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/there-will-be-little-privacy-in-the-workplace-of-the-future)\n  * [AI providers will increasingly compete with management consultancies](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/ai-providers-will-increasingly-compete-with-management-consultancies)\n  * [The sunny and the dark side of AI](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/28/the-sunny-and-the-dark-side-of-ai)\n\nThis article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under\nthe headline \"Leave it to the experts\"\n\n[Reuse this\ncontent](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=AI%20providers%20will%20increasingly%20compete%20with%20management%20consultancies&publicationDate=2018-03-28&contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fq54um34qk52lggdf3gg5prd6tqme6q2g&type=SR&orderBeanReset=TRUE)[The\nTrust Project](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n\n## The best of our journalism, handpicked each day\n\nSign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today\n\n[Sign up now](https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter)\n\n![A hand holding a newspaper](/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg)\n\n  * [Subscribe](https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/Footer)\n  * [Group subscriptions](https://groupsubscriptions.economist.com)\n  * [Help](https://www.economist.com/help/home)\n\n## Keep updated\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/theeconomist)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-economist)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/economistmagazine)\n  * [RSS](https://www.economist.com/rss)\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in _\u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d_\n\n## Apps & media\n\n  * [The Economist apps](https://www.economist.com/apps)\n  * [Economist Films](https://films.economist.com)\n  * [Podcasts](https://www.economist.com/blogs/podcasts)\n\n## Other publications\n\n  * [1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com)\n  * [The World in](https://theworldin.economist.com/)\n  * [The World If](https://www.economist.com/worldif18)\n\n## The Economist\n\n  * [About](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n  * [Advertise](http://marketingsolutions.economist.com)\n  * [Press centre](https://press.economist.com)\n\n## The Economist Group\n\n  * [Economist Group](https://www.economistgroup.com/)\n  * [The Economist Store](https://shop.economist.com)\n  * [Careers](https://economistgroupcareers.com)\n  * [Which MBA?](https://www.economist.com/whichmba)\n  * [GMAT Tutor](https://gmat.economist.com/)\n  * [GRE Tutor](https://gre.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Jobs](http://jobs.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Education Navigator](https://execed.economist.com)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.economist.com/legal/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/privacy)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html)\n  * [Manage Cookies](https://l3.evidon.com/site/2254/668/6?lang=en-gb)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.economist.com/help/accessibilitypolicy)\n  * [Modern Slavery Statement](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/guiding_principles.html)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](http://privacyportal.economist.com/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

[+] capabilities but questions still remain.\n\n\u00a9 2015 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nAccording to [several media reports](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-\nfsd-computer-retrofit-model-s-owner/), the new AI chips\n[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) devised to achieve true self-driving car\nstatus have begun rolling out to older Tesla models that require retrofitting\nto replace the prior on-board processors.\n\nUnfortunately, there has been some misleading reporting about those chips, a\nspecial type of AI computer processor that extensively supports Artificial\nNeural Networks (ANN), commonly referred to as [Machine\nLearning](https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/machine-learning-ultra-\nbrittleness-and-object-orientation-poses-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/)\n(ML) or [Deep Learning](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/plasticity-\nin-deep-learning-dynamic-adaptations-for-ai-self-driving-cars/) (DL).\n\nBefore I explore the over-hyped reporting, let me clarify that these custom-\ndeveloped AI chips devised by Tesla engineers are [certainly\nadmirable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/22/musk-unveils-\naudacious-vision-for-tesla-self-driving-tech-but-level-5-target-looks-\nunlikely), and the computer hardware design team deserves to be proud of what\nthey have done. Kudos for their impressive work.\n\nBut such an acknowledgement does not also imply that they have somehow\nachieved a [singularity\nmarvel](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/singularity-and-ai-self-\ndriving-cars/) in AI, and nor does it mean they have miraculously solved the\nreal-world problem of how to attain a [true self-driving driverless\ncar](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-mother-ai-\nprojects-moonshot/).\n\nToday In: [Transportation](https://www.forbes.com/transportation)\n\n  * [\n\n### Tesla Plans Pay Cuts And Worker Furloughs As COVID-19 Shutdown Drags On\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/08/tesla-plans-pay-cuts-\nand-worker-furloughs-as-covid-19-shutdown-drags-on/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Tesla Model Y Liftgate And The Failure Of First Principles\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/04/07/tesla-model-y-\nliftgate-and-the-failure-of-first-principles/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Einride\u2019s Autonomous Pod Trucks Now Schlepping Around Sweden\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastianblanco/2020/04/07/einrides-autonomous-\npod-trucks-now-schlepping-around-sweden/)\n\nNot by a long shot.\n\nAnd yet many in the media seem to think so, and at times have implied in a\nwide-eyed overzealous way that Tesla\u2019s new computer processors have seemingly\nreached a nirvana of finally getting us to [fully autonomous\ncars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/13/first-ever-picture-\nof-a-black-hole-still-no-picture-of-a-true-driverless-car).\n\nThat\u2019s just not the case.\n\nTime to unpack the matter.\n\n**Important Context About AI Chips**\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what an AI chip consists of.\n\nA conventional computer contains a core processor or chip that does the\nsystems work when you invoke your word processor or spreadsheets or are\nloading and running an app of some kind.\n\nIn addition, most modern computers also have GPU\u2019s, Graphical Processing\nUnits, an additional set of processors or chips that aid the core processor by\ntaking on the task of displaying visual graphics and animation that you might\nsee on the screen of your device such as on the display of a desktop PC, a\nlaptop or a smartphone.\n\nTo use computers for [Machine\nLearning](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/machine-learning-ultra-\nbrittleness-and-object-orientation-poses-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/) or\n[Deep Learning](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ai-machine-child-\ndeep-learning-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/), it was realized that rather\nthan necessarily using the normal core processors of a computer to do so, the\nGPU\u2019s actually tended to be better suited for the ML or DL tasks.\n\nThis is due to the aspect that by-and-large the implementation of Artificial\nNeural Networks in today\u2019s computers is really a massive numerical and linear\nalgebra kind of affair. GPU\u2019s are generally structured and devised for that\nkind of numeric mashing.\n\nAI developers that rely upon ML/DL computer-based neural networks fell in love\nwith GPU\u2019s, utilizing GPU\u2019s for something not particularly originally\nenvisioned but that happens to be a good marriage anyway.\n\nOnce it became apparent that having souped-up GPU\u2019s would help advance today\u2019s\nkind of AI, the chip developers realized that it could be a huge market\npotential for their processors and therefore merited tweaking GPU designs to\nmore closely fit to the ML/DL task.\n\nTesla had initially opted to use off-the-shelf specialized GPU chips made by\n[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), doing so for the Tesla in-car on-\nboard processing efforts of the Tesla version of ADAS (Advanced Driver-\nAssistance System), including and especially for their so-called Tesla\nAutoPilot (a naming that has generated controversy for being misleading about\nthe actual driverless functionality to-date available in their so-equipped\n\u201cFSD\u201d or Full Self-Driving cars).\n\nIn [April of this\nyear](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/22/musk-unveils-\naudacious-vision-for-tesla-self-driving-tech-but-level-5-target-looks-\nunlikely), Elon Musk and his team unveiled a set of proprietary AI chips that\nwere secretly developed in-house by Tesla (rumors about the effort had been\nfloating for quite a while), and the idea was that the new chips would replace\nthe use of the in-car NVIDIA processors.\n\nThe unveiling of the new AI chips was a key portion of the [Investor Autonomy\nDay event](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/22/musk-unveils-\naudacious-vision-for-tesla-self-driving-tech-but-level-5-target-looks-\nunlikely) that Tesla used as a forum to announce the future plans of their\nhoped-for self-driving driverless capability.\n\nSubsequently, [in late August](https://www.cnet.com/news/meet-tesla-self-\ndriving-car-computer-and-its-two-ai-brains/), a presentation was made by Tesla\nengineers depicting additional details about their custom-designed AI chips,\ndoing so at the annual [Hot Chips conference](https://www.hotchips.org/)\nsponsored by [the IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) that focuses on high\nperformance computer processors.\n\nOverall media interest about the Tesla AI chips was reinvigorated by the\npresentation and likewise further stoked by the roll-out that has apparently\nnow gotten underway.\n\nOne additional important point \u2014 most people refer to these kinds of\nprocessors as \u201cAI chips,\u201d which I\u2019ll do likewise for ease of discussion\nherein, but please do not be lulled into believing that these specialized\nprocessors are actually fulfilling the long-sought goal of being able to [have\nfull Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/singularity-and-ai-\nself-driving-cars/) in all of its [intended\nfacets](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/turing-test-ai-self-driving-\ncars/).\n\nAt best, these chips or processors are simulating relatively shallow\nmathematically inspired aspects of what might be called neural networks, but\nit isn\u2019t at all anything akin to a human brain. There isn\u2019t any [human-like\nreasoning or common-sense\ncapability](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/common-sense-reasoning-\nand-ai-self-driving-cars/) involved in these chips. They are merely\ncomputationally enhanced numeric calculating devices.\n\n**Brouhaha About Tesla\u2019s New Chips**\n\nIn quick recap, Tesla opted to replace the NVIDIA chips and did so by\ndesigning and now deploying their own Tesla-designed chips (the chips are\nbeing manufactured for Tesla [by Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/)).\n\nLet\u2019s consider vital questions about the matter.\n\n\u00b7        Did it make sense for Tesla to have gone on its own to make\nspecialized chips, or would they have been better off to continue using\nsomeone else\u2019s off-the-shelf specialized chips?\n\n\u00b7        On a comparison basis, how are the Tesla custom chips different or\nthe same as off-the-shelf specialized chips that do roughly the same thing?\n\n\u00b7        What do the AI chips achieve in terms of aiming for becoming true\nself-driving cars?\n\n\u00b7        And so on.\n\nHere are some key thoughts on these matters:\n\n\u00b7         ** _Hardware-Only Focus_**\n\nIt is crucial to realize that discussing these AI chips is only a small part\nof a bigger picture, since the chips are a hardware-only focused element.\n\nYou need software, really good software, in order to arrive at a true self-\ndriving car.\n\nAs an analogy, suppose someone comes out with a new smartphone that is\nincompatible with the thousands upon thousands of apps in the marketplace.\nEven if the smartphone is super-fast, you have the rather more daunting issue\nthat there aren\u2019t any apps for the new hardware.\n\nMedia salivating over the Tesla AI chips is missing the boat on asking about\nthe software needed to arrive at driverless capabilities.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that having good hardware is not important, it is, but I think\nwe all now know that hardware is only part of the battle.\n\nThe software to do true AI self-driving is [the 500-pound\ngorilla](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/grand-convergence-explains-\nrise-self-driving-cars/).\n\nThere has yet to be any publicly revealed indication that the software for\nachieving true self-driving by Tesla has been crafted.\n\nAs I previously reported, the AI team at Tesla has been [restructured and\nrevamped](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/05/19/elon-musk-\nrestructures-tesla-autopilot-team-its-boon-or-bust-time/), presumably in an\neffort to gain added traction towards the goal of having a driverless car, but\nso far [no new\nindication](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/22/musk-unveils-\naudacious-vision-for-tesla-self-driving-tech-but-level-5-target-looks-\nunlikely) has demonstrated that the vaunted aim is imminent.\n\n\u00b7         ** _Force-fit Of Design_**\n\nIf you were going to design a new AI chip, one approach would be to sit down\nand come up with all of the vital things you\u2019d like to have the chip do.\n\nYou would [blue sky it](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/starting-\nover-on-ai-and-self-driving-cars/), starting with a blank sheet, aiming to\nstretch the AI boundaries as much as feasible.\n\nFor Tesla, the hardware engineers were actually handed a circumstance that\nimposed a [lot of severe\nconstraints](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/groupthink-dilemmas-for-\ndeveloping-ai-self-driving-cars/) on what they could devise.\n\nThey had to keep the electrical power consumption within a boundary dictated\nby the prior designs of the Tesla cars, otherwise it would mean that the\nTeslas already in the marketplace would have to undergo a major retrofit to\nallow for a more power hungry set of processors. That would be costly and\neconomically infeasible. Thus, right away the new AI chip would be hampered by\nhow much power it could consume.\n\nThe new processors would have to fit into the physical space as already set\naside on existing Tesla cars, meaning that the size and shape of the on-board\nsystem boards and computer box would have to abide by a strict \u201cform factor.\u201d  \n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is oftentimes the downside of being a first-mover into a market.\n\nYou come out with a product when few others have something similar, it gains\nsome success, and so you need to then try to advance the product as the\nmarketplace evolves, yet you are also trapped by needing to be backward-\ncompatible with what you already did.\n\nThose that come along after your product has been underway have the latitude\nof not being ensnared by what came before, sometimes allowing them to out-\nperform by having an open slate to work with.\n\nAn example of overstepping \u201cfirst movers\u201d includes the rapid success of Uber\nand Lyft and the [ridesharing\nphenomena](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ridesharing-services-and-\nai-self-driving-cars-notably-uber-in-or-uber-out/). The newer entrants ignored\nexisting constraints faced by taxi\u2019s and cabs, allowing the brazen upstarts to\neclipse those that were hampered by the past (rightfully or wrongly so).\n\nBeing first in something is not necessarily always the best, and sometimes\nthose that come along later on can move in a more agile way.\n\nDon\u2019t misinterpret my remarks to imply that for self-driving cars you can\nwildly design AI chips in whatever manner you fancy. Obviously, there are\ngoing to be size, weight, power consumption, cooling, cost, and other factors\nthat limit what sensibly can appropriately fit into a driverless car.\n\n\u00b7         ** _Improper Comparisons_**\n\nOne of my biggest beefs about the media reporting has been the willingness to\nfall into a misleading and improper comparison of the Tesla AI chips to other\nchips.\n\nComparing the new with the old is not especially helpful, though it sounds\nexciting when you do so, and instead the comparison should be with what else\n_currently_ exists in the marketplace.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean.\n\nMost keep saying that the Tesla AI chips are many times faster than the Tesla\nprior-used [NVIDIA chips](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-\ncars/drive-platform/hardware/) (but they ought to be comparing to [NVIDIA\u2019s\nother newer chips](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-\nplatform/hardware/)), implying that Tesla made a breathtaking breakthrough in\nthis kind of technology, often quoting the number of trillions of operations\nper second, known as TOPS.\n\nI won\u2019t inundate you with the details herein, but suffice to say that the\nTesla AI chips TOPS performance is either on par with other alternatives in\nthe marketplace, or in some ways less so, and in selective other ways somewhat\nbetter, but it is not a hit-it-out-of-the-ballpark revelation.\n\nBottom-line: I ask that the media stop making [inappropriate\ncomparisons](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/04/23/tesla-self-driving/)\nbetween the Tesla AI chips and the Tesla prior-used NVIDIA chips, it just\ndoesn\u2019t make sense, it is misleading to the public, it is unfair, and it\nreally shows ignorance about the topic.\n\nAnother pet peeve is the tossing around of big numbers to impress the non-\ninitiated, such as touting that the Tesla AI chips consist of 6 billion\ntransistors.\n\nOn my gosh, 6 billion seems like such a large number and implies something\ngargantuan.  \n\nWell, there are GPU\u2019s that already have [20 billion\ntransistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count).\n\nI\u2019m not denigrating the 6 billion, and only trying to point out that those\nquoting the 6 billion do so without offering any viable context and therefore\nimply something that isn\u2019t really the case.\n\nFor those readers that are hardware types, I know and you know that trying to\nmake a comparison by the number of transistors is a rather problematic\nexercise anyway, since it can be an apples-to-apples or an apple-to-oranges\nkind of comparison, depending upon what the chip is designed to do.\n\n\u00b7         **First Gen Is Dicey**\n\nAnybody that knows anything about chip design can tell you that the first\ngeneration of a newly devised chip is oftentimes a rocky road.\n\nThere can be a slew of [latent errors or\nbugs](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/debugging-of-ai-self-driving-\ncars/) (if you prefer, we can be gentler in our terminology and refer to those\naspects as quirks or the proverbial tongue-in-cheek \u201chidden features\u201d).\n\nLike the first version of any new product, the odds are that it will take a\nshakeout period to ferret out what might be amiss.\n\nIn the case of chips, since it is encased in silicon and not readily\nchangeable, there are sometimes software patches used to deal with hardware\nissues, and then in later versions of the chip you might make the needed\nhardware alterations and improvements.\n\nThis brings up the point that by Tesla choosing to make its own AI chips,\nrather than using an off-the-shelf approach, it puts Tesla into the unenviable\nposition of having a first gen and needing to figure out on-their-own whatever\nguffaws those new chips might have.\n\nTypically, an off-the-shelf commercially available chip is going to have not\njust the original maker looking at it, but will also have those that are\nbuying and incorporating the processor into their systems looking at it too.\nThe more eyes, the better.\n\nThe Tesla proprietary chips are presumably only being scrutinized and tested\nby Tesla alone.\n\n\u00b7         ** _Proprietary Chip Woes_**\n\nUsing your own self-designed chips has a lot of other considerations worth\nnoting.\n\nAt Tesla, there would have been a significant cost and attention that was\ndevoted toward devising the AI chips.\n\nWas that cost worth it?\n\nWas the diverted attention that might have gone to other matters a lost\nopportunity cost?\n\nPlus, Tesla not only had to bear the original design cost, they will have to\nendure the ongoing cost to upgrade and improve the chips over time.\n\nThis is not a one-time only kind of matter.\n\nIt would seem unlikely and unwise for Tesla to sit on this chip and not\nadvance it.\n\nAdvances in AI chips are moving at lightening-like paces.\n\nThere are also the labor pool considerations too.\n\nHaving a proprietary chip usually means that you have to grow your own\nspecialists to be able to develop the specialized software for it. You cannot\nreadily find those specialists in the marketplace per se, since they won\u2019t\nknow your proprietary stuff, whereas when you use a commercial off-the-shelf\nchip, the odds are that you can find expert labor for it since there is an\necosystem surrounding the off-the-shelf processor.\n\nI am not saying that Tesla was mistaken per se to go the proprietary route,\nand only time will tell whether it was a worthwhile bet.\n\nBy having their own chip, they can potentially control their own destiny and\nnot be dependent upon an off-the-shelf chip made by someone else, and not be\nforced into the path of the off-the-shelf chip maker, while the other side of\nthat coin is they now find themselves squarely in the chip design and upgrade\nbusiness, in addition to the car making business.\n\nIt\u2019s a calculated gamble and a trade-off.\n\nFrom a cost perspective, it might or might not be a sensible approach, and\nthose that keep trying to imply that the proprietary chip is a lesser cost\nstrategy are likely not including the full set of costs involved.\n\nBe wary of those that do those off-the-cuff cost claims.\n\n\u00b7         **Redundancy Assertions**\n\nThere has been media excitement about how the Tesla AI chips supposedly have a\nrobust redundancy capability, which certainly is [essential for a real-time\nsystem](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/cognitive-timing-for-ai-self-\ndriving-cars/) that involves the life-and-death aspects of driving a car.\n\nSo far, the scant details revealed seemed to be that there are two identical\nAI chips running in parallel and if one of the chips disagrees with the other\nchip that the current assessment of the driving situation and planned next\nstep is discarded, allowing for the next \u201cframe\u201d to be captured and analyzed.\n\nOn the surface, this might seem dandy to those that haven\u2019t developed [fault-\ntolerant real-time systems](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/fail-\nsafe-ai-and-self-driving-cars/) before.\n\nThere are serious and somber issues to consider.\n\nPresumably, on the good side, if one of the chips experiences a foul hiccup,\nit causes the identical chip to be in disagreement, and because the two chips\ndon\u2019t agree, the system potentially avoids undertaking an inappropriate\naction.\n\nBut, realize that the ball is simply being punted further down-the-field, so\nto speak.\n\nThis has downsides.\n\nSuppose the oddball quirk isn\u2019t just a single momentary fluke, and instead\nrecurs, over and over.\n\nDoes this mean that both chips are going to continually disagree and therefore\npresumably keep postponing the act of making a driving decision?\n\nIf you were driving a car, and you kept postponing making a vital driving\ndecision, imagine if that decision involved whether or not to swerve to avoid\na fully loaded tanker truck stranded in the roadway ahead.\n\nNot making a decision is [not necessarily the best\ndriving](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/cognitive-timing-for-ai-\nself-driving-cars/) strategy.\n\nAnother design consideration is the assertion that both chips have to agree.\n\nWell, suppose that both chips make a bad choice, which could happen, and since\nthey are identical and presumably going to agree in their wrongfully selected\nchoice, you have a reinforced possible foul-up, based simply on the aspect\nthat both agreed to it.\n\nThis is why sometimes you purposely create an additional redundant system that\nis separate and purposely not identical in its making, trying to overcome the\nchances of a flaw inside a merely repeated or duplicate system.\n\nYet another facet is the need for a kind of [self-awareness\ncapability](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-awareness-self-\ndriving-cars-know-thyself/), namely that if the two chips disagree, why did\nthey disagree?\n\nAnd, equally or maybe more importantly, you would be best advised to find a\nmeans to learn something valuable from the disagreements that might occur,\nimproving the ability to jointly agree when they perhaps shouldn\u2019t be\ndisagreeing anymore.\n\nI can go on-and-on (see my article on [fault tolerance for AI self-driving\ncars](https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/fail-safe-ai-and-self-driving-\ncars/), and my piece too about [arguing machines and autonomous\ncars](https://www.aitrends.com/features/ai-arguing-machines-and-ai-self-\ndriving-cars/)).\n\nI think you get the gist that there\u2019s a lot more to proper redundancy and so\nthe media that touts how Tesla has opted to do so is really offering an ill-\ninformed opinion without any proper basis to make the assertion that it is\nrobust.\n\nIt might be, and I\u2019m not saying that it isn\u2019t, and only saying that the media\nshouldn\u2019t be alluding to something that we don\u2019t know has strong legs or not.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSome have said that it is a gutsy move by Tesla to have gone the self-designed\ncustom AI chip route for their self-driving car capabilities.\n\nWas it a smart and business savvy choice?\n\nWas it a vanity decision?\n\nWill it turnout to be their best decision or their worst decision?\n\nOverall, it is one of those bet-the-company kind of gambles, since their\nability to achieve true self-driving driverless cars rests predominantly on\nthat decision.\n\nYou might say they\u2019ve placed all of their chips on these new AI chips.\n\nFollow me on

Able to monitor multiple patients in separate rooms\nsimultaneously; staying on top of their blood pressure, pulse and vital signs;\nand spotting signs of deterioration even before the patients feel it\nthemselves.\n\nThis medical superhero is not human, but rather a product of artificial\nintelligence, advanced software algorithms, sensors and cameras. And it\u2019s\nbeing assembled right now at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.\n\nThe creation of an AI-powered \u201csuper nurse\u201d is the result of a decade of\nsteady work by Ahuva Weiss-Meilik and her team in the hospital\u2019s [I-Medata\ncenter](https://www.tasmc.org.il/taami/Pages/about.aspx).\n\n\u201cOur doctors and nurses can\u2019t be everywhere,\u201d Weiss-Meilik tells ISRAEL21c. A\nthought no doubt being echoed across Chinese hospitals in the midst of the\ncoronavirus outbreak right now.\n\nThe situation is made even worse by chronic staff shortages in hospitals\naround the world, including those in Israel.\n\nThe hospital is currently conducting a trial of Weiss-Meilik\u2019s continuous\nmonitoring technology with 24 patients in \u201cregular\u201d internal-medicine wards.\nThey have all given their consent. (Big Brother may be watching but he has\npermission.)\n\nSensors check patients\u2019 blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate, while a\ncamera watches at all times. The data is streamed to a central viewing station\nwhere hospital staff is alerted if a change develops.\n\nIf monitoring were the entire extent of Weiss-Meilik\u2019s project, it wouldn\u2019t be\nso potentially game-changing.\n\nBut the I-Medata team is developing predictive algorithms that can determine,\nbased on the camera and sensor data (a drop in blood pressure, for example),\ncombined with information from a patient\u2019s electronic medical record (EMR) and\naggregated data, what a particular patient\u2019s medical trajectory is most likely\nto be \u2013 and whether that patient should be given extra attention.\n\nAI can spot potential deterioration hours before a human nurse or doctor\ncould. And it can tell if a patient is likely to be readmitted in the future.\n\n\u201cNo doctor, no matter how good he or she is, would be able to look at all this\ndata and gain immediate insight,\u201d Weiss-Meilik points out.\n\n\u201cAI testing will eventually be a part of all hospital admissions in the\nfuture,\u201d she predicts.\n\n**Big hospital data**\n\n![](https://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tlvsourasky.jpg)\n\nEntrance to Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Photo: courtesy\n\nTel Aviv Medical Center- Israel\u2019s largest acute-care facility, with 1,500 beds\n-- has an advantage in implementing this type of big data system because it\u2019s\nlong been at the forefront of collecting patient data in Israel.\n\n\u201cWe have computerized medical records going 10 years back,\u201d Weiss-Meilik says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s enabled us to do this kind of research and development.\u201d\n\nWeiss-Meilik\u2019s team now is creating an ecosystem within the hospital \u201cto\ninform and support our clinical staff.\u201dWhile the artificial intelligence and\nalgorithm development is being kept in-house, the I-Medata department has\npartnered with two Israeli startups.\n\n[AnyVision](http://www.anyvision.co) of Holon, which specializes in face, body\nand object-recognition software, is powering the cameras.\n\nThe company generally works in the security and surveillance sphere, including\nlaw enforcement, retail, banking and casino clients; this is AnyVision\u2019s first\nforay into powering medical technology. (The company closed a $74 million\nSeries A financing round in June 2019.)\n\n[BioBeat](http://www.bio-beat.com), based in Petah Tikva, is behind the\nsensors. The company has developed a disposable patch worn on the skin to\ntrack such vital signs as blood pressure, oxidation rate, pulse, skin\ntemperature and sweat.\n\n![](https://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Biosensor.jpg)\n\nBioBeat\u2019s sensor patch tracks vital signs. Photo: courtesy\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t have to measure anything,\u201d BioBeat Chief Medical Officer Arik\nEisenkraft tells ISRAEL21c.\n\nAll the vitals are transmitted in real time via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to the\npatient\u2019s EMR as well as to the BioBeat cloud, so BioBeat can learn from the\ndata and improve functionality.\n\nBioBeat has received US Food and Drug Administration clearance for its cuff-\nless non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. The company has also developed a\nwristwatch device for monitoring vital signs at home, Eisenkraft says.\n\n**Making the hospital more intelligent**\n\nWeiss-Meilik\u2019s group is also working on integrating other areas of Israeli-\ndeveloped AI into the hospital workflow.\n\nMedical imaging startups [Zebra Medical ](http://www.israel21c.org/dell-likes-\nthis-israeli-crowdsourced-approach-to-radiology/)and\n[Aidoc](https://www.israel21c.org/ai-tool-helps-radiologists-clear-dangerous-\ndata-bottleneck/) both use artificial intelligence to help radiologists\nquickly spot problem areas.\n\n[Agamon](https://www.agamonhealth.com) specializes in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to make sense of unstructured text summaries in patients\u2019\nrecords, such as operation summaries and radiological reports. The system puts\nthese summaries into a structured database format.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of human resources to do that,\u201d explains Weiss-Meilik. \u201cUsing\nAI, we can open up data that was useless before in order to do advanced\nresearch.\u201d\n\nDirector-general Dr. Ronni Gamzu calls I-Medata\u2019s work \u201cthe future of\nmedicine.\u201d\n\nWhile some patients are not connected to a monitor \u201cbecause their condition\ndoes not require it,\u201d Gamzu told\n[Ynet](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5581504,00.html), \u201csometimes\nthey suddenly \u2018surprise\u2019 us and their condition starts to deteriorate. The\nmedical staff needs systems to help them identify complex situations and to\nnavigate through massive amounts of data.\u201d\n\nWeiss-Meilik is the head of the medical center\u2019s Data Science and Quality\nDivision. She previously served as the national coordinator of the Middle East\nQuality in Health Care Program coordinated by Harvard University, and headed\nthe clinical and economic performance unit at Sheba Medical Center. She\nreceived her PhD from the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019re still at an early stage,\u201d Weiss-Meilik tells ISRAEL21c. \u201cBut\nif we develop these models and get them on the market, we could improve health\nworldwide.\u201d\n\nThat would be a super nurse, indeed.\n\n[ UNCOVER ISRAEL - Get the ISRAEL21c  \nWeekly Edition free by email ](/wp-content/themes/rgb/popup.php)\n\n[ Sign Up Now! ](/wp-content/themes/rgb/popup.php)\n\nGive  \nEvery  \nMonth\n\nHelp ISRAEL21c uncover  \nthe Israel we love\n\nFor over 16 years, ISRAEL21c has brought you the faces and places of Israel\nevery day, spreading the word about Israel to millions of people in virtually\nevery country around the globe.

first\nchampion coming to League of Legends in 2020. Sett is the upcoming juggernaut\nfrom Ionia, a champion of raw power players will fight with in the top lane.\n\nSett became a leader of Iona\u2019s criminal underworld after overtaking a fighting\npit he used to stand at as the champion. He turned the pit into his own empire\nand is now looking for fresh blood he can earn more money with on Summoner\u2019s\nRift. And players now have an opportunity to impress him.\n\nDuring the recent Public Beta Environment cycle, Sett\u2019s calling card was\ndatamined. Riot hasn\u2019t shared any details on how to get the card or what the\ncard gives. The datamine shows the card can be gained by impressing Sett and\nwill be openable later in January.\n\nSome PBE players already got an opportunity to earn themselves the calling\ncard. Here\u2019s how you can do it once it\u2019s live on public servers as well.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yC54xM-\nnL6hdrgXsnRxGpfIv2L16dC1XHwvx_N6AvWx47CDfu1-WIKLwDsmW2hHRVrESdchxs_pKgCxFDY03N7YvXu7KnI4sZYu8JPKQw2PQSfT0OBTGYPTYNtyLHp9kM8Bxgd60)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yC54xM-\nnL6hdrgXsnRxGpfIv2L16dC1XHwvx_N6AvWx47CDfu1-WIKLwDsmW2hHRVrESdchxs_pKgCxFDY03N7YvXu7KnI4sZYu8JPKQw2PQSfT0OBTGYPTYNtyLHp9kM8Bxgd60)\nImage via[ Surrender at 20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2019/11/1127-pbe-\nupdate-loot-assets-skin-bios.html)\n\n## How to impress Sett?\n\nPlayers reported a few different methods that led them to Sett\u2019s Calling Card.\nTo get the calling card, they had to pull off an amazing feat in a game. Some\nplayers that have gotten the card on PBE claim to have gotten it after they\ndealt the highest amount of damage in a game, got S+ grades, or got\nquadrakills or pentakills.\n\nThe only way to get the card confirmed by a number of sources, however, is by\ntaking first blood. Many players confirmed they received it after getting 10\nfirst blood kills. The kills count in Summoner\u2019s Rift and Howling Abyss games,\nexcluding limited-time game modes, custom, and bot games.\n\n## What does Sett\u2019s Calling Card give?\n\nWhile many players already had an opportunity to impress Sett and receive the\ncard, no one really knows what the card does. Riot already announced Sett\u2019s\nabilities and placed him in the _League_ universe, but everything about the\ncard has been kept a secret.\n\nThe card will be put in use starting on Jan. 14, which is likely when Sett\nwill be released as well. He\u2019s coming with the new additions to the Mecha\nKingdoms skin line [that is replacing next year's Lunar\nevent](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-confirms-there-wont-\nbe-any-lunar-revel-skins-in-2020-but-there-will-be-a-twitch-skin) and is\ngetting one of the skins

reviews](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/ai-book-\nreviews/), a series of posts that explore the latest literature on AI._\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to say that artificial intelligence is one of\nthe most confusing and least understood fields of science. On the one hand, we\nhave headlines that warn of [deep\nlearning](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/02/15/what-is-deep-learning-neural-\nnetworks/) outperforming medical experts, creating their own language and\n[spinning fake news stories](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/09/02/openai-\ngpt-2-machine-learning-fake-news/). On the other hand, AI experts point out\nthat [artificial neural networks](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/08/05/what-is-\nartificial-neural-network-ann/), the key innovation of current AI techniques,\nfail at some of the most basic tasks that any human child can perform.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also marked with some of the most divisive disputes\nand rivalries. Scientists and researchers are constantly quarreling over the\nvirtues and shortcomings of different AI techniques, further adding to the\nconfusion and chaos.\n\nBetween tales of killer drones and robots that can\u2019t brew a cup of coffee, a\nbook that sheds light on the real capabilities and limits of artificial\nintelligence is an invaluable and necessary read. And this is exactly how I\nwould describe _[Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking\nHumans](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294/294649/artificial-\nintelligence/9780241404829.html)_ , a book by computer science professor\nMelanie Mitchell.\n\nWith a rich background in artificial intelligence and computer science,\nMitchell sorts out, in her own words, \u201chow far artificial intelligence has\ncome,\" and elucidates AI's \"disparate\u2014and sometimes conflicting\u2014goals.\u201d As AI\nis drawing growing attention from investors, governments and the media,\nMitchell\u2019s _Guide for Thinking Humans_ lays out the good, bad and ugly of\nartificial intelligence.\n\n## Tracking the history of artificial intelligence\n\nMost of us reading news headlines view artificial intelligence in the context\nsensational articles that have started to appear in mainstream media in the\npast few years. But there\u2019s much more to AI, which has a history that dates\nback to the early days of computing.\n\n![artificial intelligence a guide for thinking humans book\ncover](https://i2.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/artificial-intelligence-a-guide-for-thinking-\nhumans.jpg?resize=252%2C377&ssl=1)![artificial intelligence a guide for\nthinking humans book cover](https://i2.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/artificial-intelligence-a-guide-for-thinking-\nhumans.jpg?resize=252%2C377&ssl=1)Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for\nThinking Humans, by Melanie Mitchell\n\n_A Guide for Thinking Humans_ demystifies some of the least understood facts\nabout artificial intelligence. As you read through the chapters, Mitchell\neloquently takes you through the six-decade history of AI. You become\nacquainted with the original vision of AI, the early efforts at creating\n[symbolic AI](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/18/what-is-symbolic-artificial-\nintelligence/) and expert systems, and parallel efforts to develop artificial\nneural networks.\n\nYou go through the [AI winters](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/11/12/artificial-\nintelligence-winter-history/), where overpromising and underdelivering\ndampened interest and funding in artificial intelligence. One of the most\nimportant parts of the book is the chapter [convolutional neural networks\n(CNN)](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/01/06/convolutional-neural-networks-cnn-\nconvnets/), the AI technique that triggered the deep learning revolution in\nthe early 2010s. While digging into the inner workings of CNNs, Mitchell also\nexplains how other scientific fields such as neuroscience and cognitive\nscience have played a crucial role in advancing AI.\n\nToday convolutional neural networks and deep learning, in general, are a\npertinent component of [many applications we use every\nday](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/30/computer-vision-applications-deep-\nlearning/).\n\n## Unveiling the dark side of deep learning advances\n\n\u201cIt turns out that the recent success of deep learning is due less to new\nbreakthroughs in AI than to the availability of huge amounts of data (thank\nyou, internet!) and very fast parallel computer hardware,\u201d Mitchell notes in\n_A Guide for Thinking Humans_. \u201cThese factors, along with improvements in\ntraining methods, allow hundred-plus-layer networks to be trained on millions\nof images in just a few days.\u201d\n\nThe trend, sparked by the ImageNet competition, has gradually morphed the\nfield from an academic contest to a \u201chigh-profile sparring match for tech\ncompanies commercializing [computer\nvision](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/01/14/what-is-computer-vision/),\u201d\nMitchell explains.\n\n![Thinking robot](https://i1.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Thinking-robot.jpg?resize=696%2C463&ssl=1)![Thinking\nrobot](https://i1.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Thinking-\nrobot.jpg?resize=696%2C463&ssl=1)\n\nThe commercialization of AI has had bad effects on the field (as [I\u2019ve also\nargued in these pages](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/08/26/deepmind-mustafa-\nsuleyman-commercial-ai/)). Mitchell points to some of the other negative\neffects of the race to beat tests and benchmarks. Precision at ImageNet has\nbecome a de facto ticket to getting funding and improving stock prices and\nproduct sales. It has also led some companies and organizations to cheat their\nway to better test results without proving robustness in real-world\nsituations.\n\n\u201cThese systems can make unpredictable errors that are not easy for humans to\nunderstand,\u201d Mitchell said in written comments to TechTalks. \u201cThe machines\noften are not able to deal with input that is different from the kind of input\nthey have been trained on.\u201d _A Guide for Thinking Humans_ provides several\nexamples of AI\u2019s failures.\n\nThere are several studies that show [deep learning models optimized for\nImageNet](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/16/objectnet-dataset-ai-computer-\nvision/) do not necessarily perform well when faced with objects in real life.\nThere are also numerous papers that show how [neural networks can make\ndangerous mistakes](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/12/27/deep-learning-\nadversarial-attacks-ai-malware/).\n\nMitchell also points out that, while very efficient at processing vast amounts\nof data, current AI models lack the generalization abilities of human\nintelligence, which makes them vulnerable to the \u201clong-tail\u201d problem: the vast\nrange of possible unexpected situations an AI system could be faced with.\nUnfortunately, current approaches to AI only try to solve these problems by\nthrowing more data and compute at the problem.\n\n\"Often these benchmark datasets don\u2019t force the learning systems to solve the\n_actual_ full problem that humans want them to solve (e.g., object\nrecognition) but allow the learning systems to use shortcuts (e.g.,\ndistinguishing textures) that work well on the benchmark dataset, but don\u2019t\ngeneralize as well as they should,\" Mitchell says.\n\nThe [obsession with creating bigger datasets and bigger neural\nnetworks](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/25/ai-research-neural-networks-\ncompute-costs/) has sidelined some of the important questions and areas of\nresearch regarding AI. Some of these topics include causality, reasoning,\ncommonsense, learning from few examples and other [fundamental elements that\ntoday\u2019s AI technology lacks](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/09/judea-pearl-\nthe-book-of-why-ai-causality/).\n\nBut at least, the ImageNet race has taught us one thing. Says Mitchell: \u201cIt\nseems that visual intelligence isn\u2019t easily separable from the rest of\nintelligence, especially general knowledge, abstraction, and language\u2026\nAdditionally, it could be that the knowledge needed for humanlike visual\nintelligence\u2026 can\u2019t be learned from millions of pictures downloaded from the\nweb, but has to be experienced in some way in the real world.\u201d\n\nFortunately, these are topics that have been gaining increasing attention in\nthe past year. In his 2019 NeurIPS keynote speech, deep learning pioneer\nYoshua Bengio discussed [system 2 deep\nlearning](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/23/yoshua-bengio-neurips-2019-deep-\nlearning/), which aims to solve some of these fundamental problems. While not\neveryone agrees with Bengio\u2019s approach (and it\u2019s not clear which approach will\nwork), the fact that these things are being discussed is a positive\ndevelopment.\n\n## The complicated world of natural language processing\n\n![machine learning natural language\nprocessing](https://i1.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AI-\nrobot-artificial-intelligence-natural-language-processing-\nnlp.jpg?resize=696%2C522&ssl=1)![machine learning natural language\nprocessing](https://i1.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AI-\nrobot-artificial-intelligence-natural-language-processing-\nnlp.jpg?resize=696%2C522&ssl=1)\n\nOne of the least-understood aspects of artificial intelligence is its\n[handling of human language](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/02/20/ai-machine-\nlearning-nlg-nlp/). The advances in the field have been tremendous. Machine\ntranslation has taken leaps and bound thanks to deep learning. Search engines\nare producing much more meaningful results. There are [AI algorithms that can\npass science tests](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/09/09/aristo-ai-science-\nexam/). And of course, there\u2019s that [OpenAI text generation\nalgorithm](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/02/25/openai-artificial-intelligence-\nfake-news/) that threatens to create a massive fake new crisis.\n\nThere has also been remarkable progress in speech recognition, an area where\nneural networks perform especially well (Mitchell calls it \u201cAI\u2019s most\nsignificant success to date in any domain\u201d). It is thanks to deep learning\nthat you can utter commands to Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. Your Gmail\u2019s Smart\nCompose and sentence completion features are powered by AI. And the numerous\nchatbot applications that have found a stable user base all leverage advances\nin natural language processing (NLP).\n\nAs Mitchell told TechTalks, \u201cI think some of these advances are very positive\ndevelopments; applications such as automated translation, speech recognition,\netc. certainly make life better. Indeed, [human-machine\ncombination](https://bdtechtalks.com/2017/12/04/what-is-the-difference-\nbetween-ai-and-augmented-intelligence/) is much better today than at any time\nin the past.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s less understood is how much today\u2019s [artificial intelligence\nsystems understand the meaning of\nlanguage](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/10/22/ai-deep-learning-human-\nlanguage/).\n\n\u201cUnderstanding language\u2014including the parts that are left unsaid\u2014is a\nfundamental part of human intelligence,\u201d Mitchell explains in _A Guide for\nThinking Humans_. Language relies on commonsense knowledge and understanding\nof the world, two areas where today\u2019s AI lacks sorely.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s machines lack the detailed, interrelated concepts and commonsense\nknowledge that even a four-year-old child brings to understanding language,\u201d\nMitchell writes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true. Even the most sophisticated language models start to break as\nsoon as you test their limits. For the moment, AI is limited to handling small\namounts of text. Alexa can perform thousands of tasks, but it can\u2019t hold a\nmeaningful conversation. Smart Compose provides interesting reply suggestions,\nbut they\u2019re only short answers to basic queries. Google Translate produces\ndecent results when you want to translate simple sentences. But [it can\u2019t\ntranslate an\narticle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-\nshallowness-of-google-translate/551570/) that contains the rich and\ncomplicated nuances of language and culture. And the text generated by\nOpenAI\u2019s famous GPT-2 language model [loses coherence as it becomes\nlonger](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-\nwrite-for-the-new-yorker).\n\n![Human mind vs artificial intelligence](https://i0.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/artificial-\nintelligence.jpg?resize=696%2C487&ssl=1)![Human mind vs artificial\nintelligence](https://i0.wp.com/bdtechtalks.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/artificial-intelligence.jpg?resize=696%2C487&ssl=1)\n\nThis is because today\u2019s AI still lacks the understanding of language. So how\nis AI performing such feats? It is basically the same pattern-matching that\nneural networks are performing on images (though in a different manner and\nwith some added tricks). Again, recent years have proven that bigger data sets\nand larger neural networks will help push the limits of NLP applications. But\nthey won\u2019t result in breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stunning to me is that speech-recognition systems are accomplishing\nall this without any understanding of the meaning of the speech they are\ntranscribing\u2026 Many people in AI, myself included, had previously believed that\nAI speech recognition would never reach such a high level of performance\nwithout actually understanding language. But we\u2019ve been proven wrong,\u201d\nMitchell writes in _A Guide for Thinking Humans._\n\nBut as she later explains in the book (and the failures of AI show), there\u2019s\nonly so much you can achieve with statistics and pattern matching. For the\nmoment, AI systems might have solved 90 percent of the problem of solving\nlanguage problems. But that last 10 percent, dealing with the implicit\nsubtleties and hidden meanings of language, remain unsolved.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed to power through that last stubborn 10 percent? More data? More\nnetwork layers? Or, dare I ask, will that last 10 percent require an actual\nunderstanding of what the speaker is saying?\u201d Mitchell reflects. \u201cI\u2019m leaning\ntoward this last one, but I\u2019ve been wrong before.\u201d\n\nSo while we enjoy the applications of artificial intelligence in natural\nlanguage processing, there\u2019s no reason to worry that [robots will soon replace\nhuman writers](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/robots-wrote-this-story/) or\ninterpreters. \u201cWhile neural machine translation can be impressively effective\nand useful in many applications, the translations, without post-editing by\nknowledgeable humans, are still fundamentally unreliable,\u201d Mitchell observes.\n\n_A Guide for Thinking Humans_ delves into many more topics, including the\nethics of AI, the intricacies of the human mind, and [the meaning of\nintelligence](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/03/francois-chollet-arc-ai-\nmeasurement/). Like several other scientists, Mitchell notes in her book that\nin intelligence, the central notion of AI, remains ill-defined, with various\nmeanings, \u201can over-packed suitcase, zipper on the verge of breaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attempt to create artificial intelligence has, at the very least, helped\nelucidate how complex and subtle are our own minds,\u201d Mitchell writes.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [AI book reviews](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/ai-book-reviews/)\n  * [Artificial intelligence](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/)\n  * [deep learning](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/deep-learning/)\n  * [neural networks](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/neural-networks/)\n\n[ __ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbdtechtalks.com%2F2020%2F01%2F13%2Fmelanie-\nmitchell-ai-guide-for-thinking-humans%2F)[ __ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+AI+book+every+thinking+human+should+read&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbdtechtalks.com%2F2020%2F01%2F13%2Fmelanie-\nmitchell-ai-guide-for-thinking-humans%2F&via=bdtechtalks)[ __ ReddIt\n](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/01/13/melanie-\nmitchell-ai-guide-for-thinking-\nhumans/&title=The+AI+book+every+thinking+human+should+read)[ __ Linkedin\n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/01/13/melanie-\nmitchell-ai-guide-for-thinking-\nhumans/&title=The+AI+book+every+thinking+human+should+read)\n\n__\n\nPrevious article[How technology can keep your business secure, online and\noffline](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/01/10/business-security-tech/)\n\nNext article[Looking forward: The future of jobs in\ncybersecurity](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/01/15/looking-forward-the-future-\nof-jobs-in-cybersecurity/)\n\n[![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5184782561a26df20cb56c8eb87eef27?s=96&d=identicon&r=g)![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5184782561a26df20cb56c8eb87eef27?s=96&d=identicon&r=g)](https://bdtechtalks.com/author/bendee983/)\n\n[Ben Dickson](https://bdtechtalks.com/author/bendee983/)\n\nBen is a software engineer and the founder of TechTalks.

latest results from the National Institute of Science and Technology\u2019s\n(NIST\u2019s) Ongoing Facial Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) for Verification\ntechnology, including nine new vendors and several new algorithms from\nreturning developers.\n\nThe results in the [September 11\nreport](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019/09/11/frvt_report_2019_09_11.pdf)\ninclude first

148 algorithms from approximately 95 vendors, though not\nall vendors participate in all categories.\n\nNIST expects [major gains in accuracy for mugshot\nmatching](https://www.biometricupdate.com/201907/nist-and-dhs-biometric-\ntechnology-center-expecting-significant-accuracy-gains) to be realized this\nyear, though the best FNMR improved

20191.13k Views\n\nSiliconrepublic.com spoke to Eric Sydell of Shaker International to get a\nbetter understanding of the role AI will play in recruitment in the future.\n\n[![Future of Work Week](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/fow-\nweek.png)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-of-work-week)\n\nMost of us are familiar with how applying for a job typically goes. Candidates\ncomplete successive steps, based on a traditional model with applicant\ntracking systems.\n\nMany of us also know from experience that it can be a slow and painful process\n\u2013 one that\u2019s difficult to receive feedback from and that often doesn\u2019t offer\nmuch meaningful insight into the job or the employer.\n\nBut how can we embrace technology to transform the recruitment process in the\nfuture? Siliconrepublic.com spoke to executive vice-president of innovation at\nShaker International, [Eric\nSydell](https://www.shakerinternational.com/member/eric-j-sydell-phd/), to\nfind out.\n\nAccording to Sydell, some companies are getting better, through being less\nreliant on outdated programmes and investing in new ways to enable\npersonalisation and clear communication.\n\n[![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Careers-in-\narticle-graphics-03.png)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/employers)\n\n## Embracing AI\n\nAs one of the founders of a\n[company](https://www.shakerinternational.com/about/) providing predictive\ntalent intelligence to improve industry recruitment methods, Sydell is by no\nmeans a newcomer to the field. The secret, he said, resides in the sharper\ntreatment of relevant information.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence [AI] and related technologies are now able to analyse\ndata much more thoroughly and powerfully than the statistical techniques of\nthose from only a few years ago.\n\n\u201cBy doing this, there\u2019s potential to better understand a person\u2019s true nature\n\u2013 not just what they typed on a resume or how they answered a simple multiple-\nchoice question,\u201d he said.\n\nOne example of a company putting these ideas into practice is [Singapore\nstart-up Impress](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-ai-chatbot-\nrecruitment-future-work), which has developed a recruiter chatbot designed for\nthe preliminary stages of the interview process.\n\n## Challenges in integration\n\n## Hiring Now\n\n  * [ ![Life at Verizon Media](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Verizon-Media-logo.png)\n\nInforming, entertaining and connecting the world\n\n](https://www.verizonmedia.com/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Dropbox](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dropbox_CMYK-small.png)\n\nHelping people and teams focus on the work that matters\n\n](https://www.dropbox.com/jobs)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Workhuman](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/WH-Logo_charcoal-gold_RGB_1101px.png)\n\nMake work more human\n\n](https://www.workhuman.com/company/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Fidelity Investments](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fidelity-logo-Featured-Employers.png)\n\nBe part of a globally successful team\n\n](https://www.fidelityinvestments.ie/page/show/careers)\n\nAI technology will drive real change in hiring processes around the world, but\nwe must be cognisant of a common pitfall, Sydell warned.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with AI in recruiting is \u2013 as with all powerful tools \u2013\nthat it can be misapplied. Companies must be extremely diligent to use it\ncarefully, and many AI start-ups are ill-equipped to see the bigger picture of\nwhen AI should be used versus when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly impossible to ensure the tool is working correctly and not\nhaving unintended consequences \u2013 such as hiring people who are good problem\nsolvers but tend to be more of one race than another.\n\n\u201cAnother large challenge is that much of this technology is so advanced that\nthe rules and regulations that govern it are hopelessly behind.\u201d\n\n## The future of recruitment\n\nThe current hiring model is frustratingly one-sided, without many benefits for\njobseekers along the way. This poses a significant problem, Sydell noted, as\npositive hiring experiences are crucial in recruitment.\n\nMutually beneficial hiring processes are the way to go, he said. Incorporating\ntwo-way conversations between employers and candidates will help both parties\ndetermine whether or not it\u2019s the right fit.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, companies will be able to match candidates with employment\nopportunities in a way that is mutually beneficial.\n\n\u201cOn top of this, assessments, interviews and other tools will be integrated in\na way such that they are not discrete steps, but a seamless flow that\neliminates redundant information collection. Candidates should also receive\nfeedback that helps them grow and learn about themselves.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, AI will ensure that the scores that come out of the hiring\nprocess are both maximally predictive of outcomes that matter to employers and\nalso free from all types of bias,\u201d he added.\n\nClearly, we still have a long journey ahead of us when it comes to harnessing\ntechnological advances to streamline the recruitment process. But, as Sydell\nnoted, there are many interesting opportunities ahead.\n\n[__Tweet](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai&text=The+future+of+recruitment+and+why+AI+will+be+pivotal+in+making+new+hires&via=siliconrepublic)\n[__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai)[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=287597001601476&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [__Email](mailto:?subject=The future of recruitment and\nwhy AI will be pivotal in making new\nhires&body=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-recruitment-tech-ai)\n[__Share](whatsapp://send?text=The%20future%20of%20recruitment%20and%20why%20AI%20will%20be%20pivotal%20in%20making%20new%20hires%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [More]()\n\n[__Share](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [__Pin\nThis](javascript:void\\(\\(function\\(\\)%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement\\('script'\\);e.setAttribute\\('type','text/javascript'\\);e.setAttribute\\('charset','UTF-8'\\);e.setAttribute\\('src','//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r='+Math.random\\(\\)*99999999\\);document.body.appendChild\\(e\\)%7D\\)\\(\\)\\);)\n[__Reddit](http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-ai&title=The future of recruitment and why AI will be pivotal\nin making new hires)\n\nIn-Depth: [Future of Work Week](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-\nof-work-week)\n\nRelated: [skills](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/skills),\n[recruitment](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/recruitment),\n[AI](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/ai),\n[technology](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/technology),\n[HR](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/hr)\n\n[![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2015/05/lisa-1.jpg)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/author/lisa-\nardill)\n\n[__](https://twitter.com/ElseeArdill)\n\n[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-ardill-75770599/)\n\nBy Lisa Ardill\n\nLisa joined the team as senior Careers reporter in July 2019 with previous\nexperience in science communication and media.

But it's still an\nillusion.\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois Chollet, a scientist in Google's artificial intelligence unit, is a\nmember of a new generation of pioneers in machine learning. In 2015, he\nintroduced the world to an application programming interface that has become\nwildly popular for implementing deep learning networks, called\n[Keras](http://keras.io/). It is most commonly used as an interface to\nGoogle's TensorFlow framework. It vastly simplifies the matter of assembling\nneural networks of various sorts.\n\nIn that way, Chollet has helped in very concrete fashion to advance the\ndevelopment and testing of deep learning. It may seem surprising, then, that\none of Chollet's foci at the moment is the very big picture of how to advance\nartificial intelligence beyond merely getting better on benchmarks.\n\nChollet is not entirely satisfied with where AI is at the moment. \"A lot of\nwell-funded, large-scale gradient-descent projects get carried out as a way to\ngenerate bombastic press articles that misleadingly suggest that human-level\nAI is perhaps a few years away,\" wrote Chollet in a communication with _ZDNet_\nin email. \"Many people have staked a lot on this illusion. But it's still an\nillusion.\"\n\n_ZDNet_ reached out to Chollet after he published a paper three weeks ago\noffering a remarkable critique of deep learning's strengths and weaknesses.\nThe paper, titled, _[On the Measure of\nIntelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547)_ , proposes a new definition\nof intelligence, and materials to help scientists develop systems that may\nachieve it, called the \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus,\" or ARC. ARC is a\ncollection of challenges for intelligent systems, a new benchmark. The idea is\nto guide AI toward \"more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems.\"\n\nChollet identifies as one of the chief limits of today's deep learning its\nobsession with incremental improvements on narrow skills tests.\n\nInstead of drills on tests, ARC would lead to evaluating systems based on how\nefficient they are in the acquisition of skills. A solution to ARC, he\nhypothesizes, would be a system that has developed some \"core knowledge\npriors,\" broad information about the world, such as object permanence, but\ndifferent from what people casually call \"common sense.\" The goal would be\ngreater \"generalization,\" meaning, an ability for a system to succeed in held-\nout, hidden tasks that have been designed to be solvable with those priors.\n\n[Code for ARC is posted on GitHub.](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC)\n\nAll this is \"highly speculative,\" writes Chollet in the paper, and currently,\n\"to the best of our knowledge, ARC does not appear to be approachable by any\nexisting machine learning technique,\" he writes.\n\n_ZDNet_ asked Chollet several questions about the effort, which he answered in\nwritten form. The questions and the answers are printed below in their\nentirety.\n\nIn his written responses, Chollet describes ARC as a product of fifteen years\nof trying to \"'understand the mind.'\" He was lately triggered, he writes, by\nthe \"narrow-mindedness\" of pronouncements he's heard made in the AI field, and\nan ahistoricity he observes in much recent work in reinforcement learning and\nsuch.\n\n**Also:[High energy: Facebook's AI guru LeCun imagines AI's next frontier\n](https://www.zdnet.com/article/high-energy-facebooks-ai-guru-lecun-imagines-\nais-next-frontier/)**\n\nSuch systems have made amazing progress and are valuable, but they are not the\n\"end-all-be-all,\" he writes. Deep learning looks up past data and performs\ninterpolation, he observes. \"But intelligence as I formally define it in the\npaper needs to feature extrapolation rather than mere interpolation.\"\n\nChollet's goal, he writes, is to \"nudge researchers into looking at questions\nthey're not currently asking, into trying ideas they would not normally\npursue.\"\n\nChollet writes that he's made some progress toward solutions to ARC, and\nexpresses hope others will too. It's so far led him into some \"interesting and\nquite unique research directions.\"\n\n**ZDNet:** _Please describe briefly how you came to the train of thought that\nbrought you to building ARC and writing the paper. What was your intellectual\npath to this point, however that question makes sense to you?_  \n\n **Francois Chollet:** This paper is my attempt to write down and formalize\nthings I've been saying for many years, in talks, in blog posts or on Twitter,\nin personal conversations. I mean it to be actionable, useful to others, not\nmerely a set of opinions -- a formal framework for rigorously expressing\ncertain ideas about generalization and intelligence, and a concrete challenge\nfor others to take on.\n\nI've been trying to \"understand\" the mind (in a broad sense) as my primary\narea of focus for a long time, for the past 15 years or so. Initially I was\ncoming at it from the perspective of neuropsychology and developmental\npsychology. I then moved towards AI, in particular \"cognitive developmental\nrobotics,'' which is the AI subfield I identified with as a university student\n-- building computational models of human cognitive developmental, sometimes\nphysically embodied into robots or at least simulations. In 2009, I started\nworking on a fairly ambitious general AI architecture I called ONEIROS (Open-\nended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System), which I worked on\nit for a few years before gradually moving on to other things. I am now using\nseveral of the ideas from that project as a basis for building an ARC solver.\nGeneral AI research wasn't very popular back then, so at some point I had to\npick up marketable skills and get a job. It has been a distraction, but I've\nnever really stopped thinking about it.\n\nSomething that has been a trigger for me to write these ideas down has been\nthe renewed interest in general AI and reinforcement learning over the past\nfew years, and what I perceive as a certain narrow-mindedness and ahistoricity\nin the sweeping pronouncements I've been hearing about it. A lot of this paper\nis about bringing much-needed context and grounding to the discussion, and\nframing things in a historical perspective. Before you start coming up with\nsweeping answers, you need to know what the right questions are, and where\nthese questions are coming from.\n\n![chollet-model-of-an-intelligent-system.png]()![chollet-model-of-an-\nintelligent-\nsystem.png](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/26/f9e1b3fe-85fc-4000-9e91-035d2ab19f63/resize/1200xauto/ca715feda35acbaafc95c59eb017a3c1/chollet-\nmodel-of-an-intelligent-system.png)\n\nOne model of how an intelligent system might be structured, according to\nChollet.\n\nF. Chollet, On the Measure of Intelligence.\n\n**ZDNet:** _How do you hope the international community of researchers will\nreceive ARC? What are your goals for it, especially given the mention of\nhaving AI competitions? Is the \"hypothetical ARC solver\" an immediate goal?_\n\n**FC:** The goal is to nudge researchers into looking at questions they're not\ncurrently asking, into trying ideas they would not normally pursue. I want\npeople to look at ARC and ask, what would it take to solve these tasks? The\nperformance of existing techniques on ARC is basically zero, whereas humans\ncan solve it without any prior training or explanations, so that's a big red\nneon sign saying that there's something going on here and that we're in need\nof novel ideas. ARC should serve both as a benchmark of progress and as a\nsource of inspiration.\n\nPersonally, ARC has already led me towards interesting and quite unique\nresearch directions, and I have made decent progress on starting to solve it,\nreusing old ideas I've been playing with for a long time. I hope this will\nsoon be true of other people as well. Fully solving ARC is probably not within\nimmediate reach, but ARC as an AI challenge is at a level of conceptual\ndifficulty where meaningful progress can be made right away. That was one of\nthe goals: ARC would be pointless if it were impossible to approach it. The\nideal challenge is something for which our performance starts at 0 -- which\nmakes it intriguing and highlights the need for fresh ideas -- but very\nquickly becomes non-zero -- which is a sign that it is triggering substantial\nconceptual progress.\n\n**Also:**[ **Futurist Tim O'Reilly sees a human-computer symbiosis bigger than\nAI**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/futurist-tim-oreilly-sees-a-human-\ncomputer-symbiosis-bigger-than-ai/)\n\n**ZDNet:** _When will we know if ARC is having constructive effects? Meaning,\nis there a measure of its impact on the research community you expect or hope\nto see in the near- to intermediate-term?_\n\n**FC:** I don't know how much interest it will generate in the first place.\nBut I am reasonably hopeful. I don't care much for academic tokens of impact\nsuch as citations, so my personal metric of success will be the rate at which\nARC gets solved. If it gets solved within a couple years, it was probably\nflawed and not sufficiently challenging. If our performance is still near-zero\nin 10 years, ARC would have been a valid challenge, but one not conducive to\nmuch progress. It will have been successful if we see a steady rate of\nmeaningful progress over a span of several years. And of course, if the ideas\nand techniques that lead to this progress actually generalize, that is to say,\nif they eventually find useful applications in real-world systems.\nPragmatically, the measure of success is your eventual impact on the world,\nnot how much you capture the attention of AI researchers or the general\npublic.\n\n**ZDNet:** _What is the value of existing work on deep learning across the\nspectrum of efforts from DeepMind's work on AphaZero and AlphaStar to the many\nadaptations of Transformer (e.g., BERT, GPT2, XLNet, etc.), especially given\nyour point on page 52 that no existing deep learning system appears able to\nsolve ARC, and your comment on page 55 about the potential to \"adapt\" existing\ngames or new tests? Are these deep learning systems valuable? Are they\nmisguided? Are they squandering resources that should be spent in a different\nway?_\n\n**FC:** I say this a lot, but deep learning is immensely valuable. What deep\nlearning does is to map an input space X to a target space Y, via a geometric\nmorphing, learned using large amounts of human-annotated data (or sometimes,\ndata with automatically-generated annotations). So deep learning is pattern\nrecognition, input-to-output mapping given a dense sampling of a data\nmanifold. But it's very good at pattern recognition.\n\nBeing good at this is a game-changer in just about any industry. You can\nunderstand it as a way to encode and operationalize existing human\nabstractions -- to automate known solutions to known problems when we're in a\nposition to collect a vast number of examples. This opens the door to a whole\nnew world of automation. So to be clear, I'm not trying to downplay the\nprofound significance of being good at this kind of thing. I've spent years of\nmy life working on deep learning. I've seen it lead to solving countless\nproblems that we thought impossible to solve just a few years ago. Always\nusing the exact same basic recipe.\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to believe that existing deep learning\ntechniques represent the end-all-be-all of AI. By construction, by training,\nwhat deep learning does is looking up past data and performing interpolation.\nThis can implement local generalization -- at best, systems that can robustly\ndo what they're trained to do, that can make sense of what they've seen\nbefore, that can handle the kind of uncertainty that their creators have\nplanned for. But intelligence as I formally define it in the paper needs to\nfeature extrapolation rather than mere interpolation -- it needs to implement\nbroad or even extreme generalization, to adapt to unknown unknowns across\npreviously unknown tasks. Intelligence is not curve-fitting.\n\nThis is something that deep learning is fundamentally not adapted for, and the\npractical results of the past few years give this view a resounding empirical\nconfirmation. Deep learning models are brittle, extremely data-hungry, and do\nnot generalize beyond their training data distribution. This is an inescapable\nconsequence of what they are and how we train them. They can at best encode\nthe abstractions we explicitly train them to encode, they cannot autonomously\nproduce new abstraction. They simply don't have the machinery for it -- it's\nlike expecting a car to start flying if only its wheel would turn fast enough.\nCars can be very useful, but if you think they can go anywhere and are the\nonly vehicle we're ever going to need, you're mistaken.\n\nIn my opinion, it is absolutely true that it is a waste of resources to be\nbuilding single-use, special-purpose, multi-million dollar AI systems that\nplay popular video games at superhuman level. It's a gimmick. The purpose of\nscientific research should be to answer open questions, to produce new\ntechnology -- in a word, to generate new knowledge that is relevant to the\nreal world, knowledge that generalizes. The purpose of research should not be\nto generate splashy headlines to impress the public. These are multi-million\ndollar efforts that, in my opinion, do not teach us anything, and do not\nproduce reusable artifacts that we can use to solve new problems. The state of\nour knowledge is the same at project completion as it was when the project\nstarted.\n\nI know this is a very heretic thing to say in the current climate, where a lot\nof well-funded large- scale gradient-descent projects get carried out as a way\nto generate bombastic press articles that misleadingly suggest that human-\nlevel AI is perhaps a few years away. Many people have staked a lot on this\nillusion. But it's still an illusion.\n\n![chollet-test-of-objectness-prior.png]()![chollet-test-of-objectness-\nprior.png](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/26/2ce5c58f-3aa1-47fb-\naf13-db4b35b80811/resize/1200xauto/11c4f5977896a35d6a9570337b83b626/chollet-\ntest-of-objectness-prior.png)\n\nOne example of a test of broad cognitive ability, as Chollet conceives of it,\na test for \"objectness.\"\n\nF. Chollet, On the Measure of Intelligence.\n\n**ZDNet:** _How should we reconcile your discussion of \"priors\" in this paper\nwith past discussion of priors in deep learning, such as, for example, the\nnotion that convolutions are a sort of \"broad prior\" underlying convolutional\nneural networks? Is your notion of priors contiguous/compatible with those\nnotions of priors as described in the writings of, for example, Yann LeCun and\nYoshua Bengio? (Cf., Lecun, Bengio, 2007, \"[Scaling learning algorithms toward\nAI](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/bengio-lecun-07.pdf)\", page 5, \"The\nflat prior assumption must be rejected: some wiring must be simpler to specify\n(or more likely) than others. In what seems like an incredibly fortunate\ncoincidence, a particularly good (if not \"correct\") wiring pattern happens to\nbe one that preserves topology.\")_\n\n**FC:** I'm actually talking about the exact same kind of knowledge priors.\nConvolution in deep learning represents the double assumption that, if you\nhave a 2D grid of variables encoding visual data, first, spatially close\nvariables are more likely to be correlated than spatially distant variables,\nand second, spatial correlation patterns are independent from location\n(translation invariance). These assumptions are actually a subset of the\nobjectness prior from Spelke's Core Knowledge theory.\n\nIn general, wiring topology in deep learning encodes assumptions about the\nstructure of correlations in the input-cross-output space -- about the shape\nof the space of information. A good topology can dramatically reduce the size\nof the search space and can improve the feasibility of finding good input-\noutput mappings via gradient descent (the big question in deep learning isn't\nso much whether your search space includes configurations that would solve\nyour problem, but whether these configurations are learnable using gradient\ndescent and the data you have available). This renders tractable problems that\nwould be impossible to solve if you didn't make sufficient assumptions. To\nlearn from data, you need to make assumptions about it. Such assumptions\nrepresent \"prior knowledge about the external world\" that belongs in the same\ncategory of priors as Core Knowledge.\n\n**Also:[A computing visionary looks beyond today's\nAI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-computing-visionary-looks-beyond-todays-\nai/)**\n\n![chollet-hierarchy-of-intelligence.png]()![chollet-hierarchy-of-\nintelligence.png](https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/26/3e5da851-731e-4983-b1ca-13d0021104c5/resize/1200xauto/5aa66686c664adb37be4ac81b6ddee78/chollet-\nhierarchy-of-intelligence.png)\n\nTraditional theories of intelligence organize cognition into levels, writes\nChollet, which may have important implications for AI.\n\nF. Chollet, On the Measure of Intelligence\n\n**ZDNet:** _What is the significance of stochasticity to intelligence? You\nhave noted a process can be stochastic in several areas of the intelligent\nsystem you describe. Is stochasticity essential to the principles you've\noutlined, is it of marginal importance/disposable? Why or why not?_\n\n**FC:** The real world and real intelligent agents (like animals or humans)\nhave many factors of uncertainty, so a model of their interaction should\naccount for this uncertainty by involving randomness and probability. But that\nis really a detail. The model of intelligence I proposed in the paper could be\nreformulated with deterministic tasks and deterministic intelligent systems\nwithout substantially changing the nature of the model and its conclusions.\nAlthough that would be quite a bit less realistic and quite a bit less\ngeneral.\n\n**ZDNet:** _Is there any value to a pursuit of intelligence that doesn't\nfollow an \"anthropocentric focus\" as you put it on page 24? Some non-human\nintelligence?_\n\n**FC:** Oh, absolutely. I do believe that intelligence that greatly differs\nfrom our own could exist and would have intrinsic value. But we probably won't\ncall it \"intelligence\" if it isn't relatable. It is a fact that we only make\nsense of other minds, or value their cognitive abilities, relatively to our\nown. We recently started noticing that animals were intelligent only because\nof the ways their behavior resemble human behavior, because of the fact they\nseem to be able to solve problems that we value. If they weren't human-like in\nat least some ways, we wouldn't even *notice* -- much less value -- the\nrichness or complexity of their information-processing abilities and their\nadaptation faculties. We don't perceive companies, markets, or science, to be\nintelligent -- yet they may be modelled as intelligent systems, and they often\nfeature greater-than-human intelligence in a certain sense.\n\nA good definition of intelligence should stay close to what people mean when\nthey talk about intelligence. And humans have a fundamentally anthropocentric\nview of intelligence. So I believe it is necessary to explicitly acknowledge\nthis fact, instead of using definitions of intelligence that ostensibly aspire\nto universality but that are implicitly describing human cognition and\noperating within a human value system.\n\n**Also:**[ **AI pioneer Sejnowski says it's all about the\ngradient**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-pioneer-sejnowski-says-its-all-\nabout-the-gradient/)\n\n**ZDNet:** _Would a system like Keras take a different form if you had built\nit starting from what you've outlined here, or, asked differently, Is there a\ntechnology artifact similar to Keras that would be the output of the\nprinciples you've outlined here?_\n\n**FC:** Given what I've learned from my ongoing attempts to solve ARC, I do\nbelieve that there will eventually be software frameworks that will package\nthese principles in an easy-to-use way for developers to leverage them in\ntheir own intelligent applications. There will be a Keras for neuro-symbolic\nprogram synthesis. An operating system for intelligence. However, this is\nstill quite far away.\n\n**ZDNet:** _With the train and evaluation test files in JSON form posted on\nGitHub, can you be sure that the tests in ARC cannot be \"gamed\" as you put it?\n(Is this the private test set of which you write?)_\n\n**FC:** At this time, it is impossible to tell with certainty whether ARC can\nbe \"gamed\" or not. My first step to answer this question will be to organize a\npublic competition around ARC, with a monetary incentive, and see what\nhappens. If there is a non-intelligent shortcut to solve ARC, chances are such\na competition would quickly bring it to light.\n\nThe competition will leverage the private test set -- a completely unknown set\nof ARC tasks. This guarantees that the algorithms used in the competition will\nhave to be able to autonomously handle new tasks, rather than being mere\nrecords of past human-generated solutions.\n\nWe'll see what happens!

 This company scraped social media to feed its AI facial recognition tool.\nIs that legal?\n\n##\n\nIf its claims are true, Clearview AI has quietly blown right past privacy\nnorms to become the nightmare many have been fearing.\n\n[ ](https://bigthink.com/u/robby-berman) [Robby\nBerman](https://bigthink.com/u/robby-berman)\n\n02 February, 2020\n\nImage source:\n[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/pathdoc)/Shutterstock/Big Think\n\n  * Recent reporting has revealed the existence of a company that has probably scraped your personal data for its facial recognition database.\n  * Though social platforms forbid it, the company has nonetheless collected personal data from everywhere it can.\n  * The company's claims of accuracy and popularity with law enforcement agencies is a bit murky.\n\n* * *\n\nYour face is all over the internet in images you and others have posted. Also\nlots of personal information. For those concerned about all those pictures\nbeing matched somehow with all that information, there's some small comfort in\npublic assertions by Google, Facebook, and other platforms that they won't use\nyour data for nefarious purposes. Of course, taking the word of companies\nwhose business model depends of data-mining is a bit of a reach.\n\nMeanwhile, as revealed recently by the [_New York\nTimes_](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-\nfacial-recognition.html), with further reporting from [BuzzFeed\nNews](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-nypd-facial-\nrecognition) and [_WIRED_](https://www.wired.com/story/clearview-ai-scraping-\nweb/), one company called [Clearview AI](https://clearview.ai) has been\nquietly scraping up much of this data \u2014 the company claims it has a database\nof _3 billion images_ collected from _everywhere_ they can. Their sources\npresumably include all sorts of online sources, as well as all social\nplatforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and so on. They even\nscrape Venmo, a particularly chilling revelation given the rigorous security\none would expect a money-exchanging site to employ.\n\nCombining their database with proprietary artificial intelligence, Clearview\nAI says it can identify a person from a picture nearly instantaneously, and\nare already selling their service to police departments for identifying\ncriminals. You may think you own your face, but Clearview has probably already\nacquired it without your even knowing about it, much less granting them\npermission to do so.\n\n### Is this legal? And does it matter?\n\nImage source: [Anton\nWatman](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/AntonWatman)/Shutterstock\n\nIn terms of Federal law protecting one's personal data, the regulations are\nway behind today's digital realities. The controlling legislation appears to\nbe the anti-hacking [Computer Fraud and Abuse\nAct](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-computer-fraud-abuse-act/)\n(CFAA) enacted in 1984, well before the internet we know today. Prior to a\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last year, the law had been used to\nfight automated data-scraping. However, that ruling determined that this type\nof scraping doesn't violate the CFAA.\n\nSocial media sites generally include anti-scraping stipulations in their user\nagreements, but these are hard \u2014 and perhaps impossible given programmers'\ningenuity \u2014 to enforce. Twitter, whose policies explicitly forbid automated\nscraping for the purposes of constructing a database, [recently\nordered](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/clearview-ai-twitter-\nletter.html) Clearview AI to knock it off. Given last year's CFAA ruling,\nthough, sites have little legal recourse when their policies are violated. In\nany event, tech is a troublingly incestuous industry \u2014 for example, a Facebook\nboard member, [Peter Thiel](https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/hulk-hogans-\nsuit-against-gawker-justice-or-a-billionaires-revenge), is one of Clearview\nAI's primary investors, so how motivated would such people really be to block\nmining of their data?\n\n### Is Clearview AI legit?\n\nImage source: Clearview AI, through Atlanta public-records request by _New\nYork Times_\n\nClearview has taken pains to remain off the public's radar, at least until the\n_New York Times_ article appeared. It __s co-founders long ago scrubbed their\nown social identities from the web, though one of them, Hoan Ton-That, has\nsince reemerged online.\n\nIn efforts to remain publicly invisible while simultaneously courting law\nenforcement as customers for Clearview's services, the company has been\nquietly publishing an array of targeted promotional materials (The _Times_ ,\nBuzzFeed, and _WIRED_ have acquired a number of these materials via Freedom of\nInformation requests and through private individuals). The ads make some\nextraordinary and questionable claims regarding Clearview's accuracy,\nsuccesses, and the number of law enforcement agencies with which it has\ncontracts. Not least, of course, among questions about the company's integrity\nmust be their extensive scraping of data from sites whose user agreements\nforbid it.\n\nAccording to Clearview, over 600 law enforcement parties have used their\nproduct in the last year, though the company won't supply a list of them.\nThere _are_ a handful of confirmed clients, however, including the Indiana\nState Police. According to the department's then-captain, the police were able\nto identify the perpetrator in a shooting case in just 20 minutes thanks to\nClearview's ability to find a video the man had posted of himself on social\nmedia. The department itself has officially declined to comment on the case\nfor T _he_ _New York Times_. Police departments in Gainesville, Florida and\nAtlanta, Georgia are also among their confirmed customers.\n\nClearview has tried to impress potential customers with case histories that\napparently aren't true. For example, they sent an email to prospective clients\nwith the title, \"How a Terrorism Suspect Was Instantly Identified With\nClearview,\" describing how their software cracked a New York subway terrorism\ncase. The NYPD says Clearview had nothing to do with it and that they used\ntheir own facial recognition system. Clearview even posted a video on Vimeo\ntelling the story, which has since been removed. Clearview has also claimed\nseveral other successes that have been denied by the police departments\ninvolved.\n\nThere is skepticism regarding Clearview's claims of accuracy, a critical\nconcern given that in this context a false positive can send an innocent\nperson to jail. Clare Garvie, of Georgetown University's Center on Privacy and\nTechnology, [tells\nBuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-nypd-\nfacial-recognition), \"We have no data to suggest this tool is accurate. The\nlarger the database, the larger the risk of misidentification because of the\ndoppelg\u00e4nger effect. They're talking about a massive database of random people\nthey've found on the internet.\"\n\nClearview has not submitted their results for independent verification, though\na FAQ on their site claims that an \"independent panel of experts rated\nClearview 100% accurate across all demographic groups according to the ACLU's\nfacial recognition accuracy methodology.\" In addition, the accuracy rating of\nfacial recognition is usually derived from a combination of variables,\nincluding its ability to detect a face in an image, its correct-match rate,\nreject rate, non-match rate, and the false-match rate. As far as the FAQ\nclaim, Garvie notes that \"whenever a company just lists one accuracy metric,\nthat is necessarily an incomplete view of the accuracy of their system.\"\n\nImage source: [Andre_Popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/apops)/Shutterstock\n\nIt may or may not be that Clearview is doing what they claim to be doing, and\nthat their technology is really accurate and seeing increasing use by police\ndepartments. Regardless, there can be little doubt that the company and likely\nothers are working toward the goal of making reliable facial recognition\navailable to law enforcement and other government agencies (Clearview also\nreportedly pitches its product to private detectives).\n\nThis has many people concerned, as it represents a major blow to personal\nprivacy. A bipartisan effort in the U.S. Senate has seemingly failed. In\nNovember 2019, Democrats introduced their own privacy bill of rights in the\n[Consumer Online Privacy Rights\nAct](https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%20Bill%20Text.pdf)\n(COPRA) while Republicans introduced their [United States Consumer Data\nPrivacy Act of 2019](https://aboutblaw.com/NaZ) (CDPA). States have also\nenacted or are in the process of considering new privacy legislation.\nPreserving personal privacy without unnecessarily constraining acceptable uses\nof data collection is complicated, and the law is likely to continue lagging\nbehind technological reality.\n\nIn any event, the exposure of Clearview AI's system is pretty chilling,\nsetting off alarms for anyone hoping to hold onto what's left of their\npersonal privacy, at least for as long as it's possible to do so.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * [Does Facial Recognition Technology Mean the End of Privacy? - Big ... \u203a](https://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/does-facial-recognition-technology-mean-the-end-of-privacy)\n  * [Amazon is selling facial recognition technology to police - Big Think \u203a](https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/yikes-amazon-is-now-selling-facial-recognition-technology-to-police)\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * [Clearview AI sued over facial recognition privacy concerns - CNET \u203a](https://www.cnet.com/news/clearview-ai-faces-lawsuit-following-facial-recognition-privacy-concerns/)\n  * [Rogue NYPD cops using facial recognition app Clearview \u203a](https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/rogue-nypd-cops-are-using-sketchy-facial-recognition-app-clearview/)\n  * [New Jersey Bars Police From Using Clearview Facial Recognition ... \u203a](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/technology/clearview-ai-new-jersey.html)\n\n[privacy](https://bigthink.com/tag/privacy) [artificial\nintelligence](https://bigthink.com/tag/artificial-intelligence) [facial\nrecognition](https://bigthink.com/tag/facial-recognition) [data\nmining](https://bigthink.com/tag/data-mining)\n[terrorism](https://bigthink.com/tag/terrorism)\n[technology](https://bigthink.com/tag/technology)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbigthink.com%2Ftechnology-\ninnovation%2Ffacial-recognition-\nclearview%3Fxrs%3DRebelMouse_fb%26ts%3D1580766568)[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bigthink.com/technology-\ninnovation/facial-recognition-\nclearview&text=This%20company%20scraped%20social%20media%20to%20feed%20its%20AI%20facial%20recognition%20tool.%20Is%20that%20legal%3F&)[__](mailto:?subject=This%20company%20scraped%20social%20media%20to%20feed%20its%20AI%20facial%20recognition%20tool.%20Is%20that%20legal%3F&body=https://bigthink.com/technology-\ninnovation/facial-recognition-clearview)[__](javascript:;)\n[__](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://bigthink.com/technology-\ninnovation/facial-recognition-\nclearview)[__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=false&url=https://bigthink.com/technology-\ninnovation/facial-recognition-clearview&)\n\n![](https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODc5NTI3NS8yMDAweC5wbmciLCJleHBpcmVzX2F0IjoxNjA2MTAwNzg5fQ.q1UV9B874M1WT2x71mDK21Sdx4-BUzp2MtpBMPrgTqQ/img.png?width=3051&height=317)\n\n![](https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjE5NDc0Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMDEyMTU3OH0.JwlkzOaMb2DwJAxqcX-\nZM-Ar2fr2662k4D6HCLGogPY/img.png?width=370&height=250)\n\nTrending\n\n[ ](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/media-bias-chart)\n\n[Politics & Current Affairs](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/)\n\n##  [ How biased is your favorite news source?

We are\ndelighted to now be working with Insilico Medicine as a veritable expert when\nit comes to artificial intelligence. We are able to evaluate new active\ningredients significantly more quickly and more efficiently by simulating\nbiological effects in silico. This enables us to cater even better to the\nconsumers' as yet unmet skincare needs,\" explains Dr. May Shana'a, Senior\nCorporate Vice President, Research and Development, at Beiersdorf.\n\nAlex Zhavoronkov, CEO of Insilico Medicine, is likewise excited about the\njoint effort: \"We firmly believe there is a great potential in this\ncollaboration. We worked with many consumer companies in the past and in my\nopinion, Beiersdorf became an undisputed leader in the area of skin research\nas well as in digital technologies in recent decades. We are delighted that\nthey have recognized the potential of artificial intelligence early on and\nhope to demonstrate the power of AI going forward in our collaboration.\"\n\n###\n\n**\n\nAbout Insilico Medicine**\n\nInsilico Medicine is an artificial intelligence company with offices in six\ncountries and regions striving to accelerate three areas of drug discovery and\ndevelopment: disease target identification, generation of novel molecules\n(generative chemistry) and synthetic biological data (generative biology), and\nprediction of clinical trial outcomes.

Some will recall this similar\nclaims [have been made\nbefore](//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/04/has-ai-discovered-\na-drug-now-guess), so what exactly are we looking at?\n\nThe compound is DSP-1181, from a collaboration between Sumitomo and the\nstartup [Exscientia](https://www.exscientia.ai/) (out of Dundee). It's a long-\nacting [5-HT1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1A_receptor) agonist, from\n[what I can see](https://www.ds-pharma.com/ir/news/pdf/ebr20200130.2.pdf)\n(page 15 of that document). The coverage says that it \"was created by using\nalgorithms that sifted through potential compounds, checking them against a\nhuge database of parameters\", and that this took one year to get into the\nclinic. If that's accurate, that is indeed a fast path into human trials, but\nlet's look at what that might get you. Will this be a drug discovery\nrevolution?\n\nThe problem is that preclinical drug optimization is not the problem. A more\nconventional program directed toward this mechanism might have taken two or\nthree years to get to a clinical trial, and it's important to realize that the\nidea of 5-HT1a as a target for anxiety and OCD is not a new idea. [Here's a\nreview](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223\\(09\\)00392-8/pdf)\nfrom 2009, for example. Exscientia has a [good deal to\nsay](https://www.exscientia.ai/ai-pharmatech) about its target-selection and\ncompound-optimization technology, but in this case they're going after a\ntarget that's been out there for many years. The publicity for DSP-1181\nemphasizes that it's a long-half-life full agonist for the receptor (as\nopposed to some partial agonists that have been tried before).\n\nThere is indeed a long, long [list of\ncompounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1A_receptor#Ligands) with\nactivity at 5-HT1a, and many of these have been in humans (or are already\napproved drugs with some 5-HT1a activity as part of their profile). The\n[azapirones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azapirone) are a prominent example,\nalthough they certainly have other activities as well, and there's [8-OH\nDPAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-OH-DPAT) and [Addyi\n(flibanserin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibanserin) too. Outside of\nthose multi-receptor compounds, there are some more selective ones such as\n[befiradol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befiradol) (which is being studied\nfor Parkinson's), the related\n[F-15,599](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15,599) (being looked at in Rett\nsyndrome), [osemozotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osemozotan) (which has\nbeen into animal models of OCD and other conditions, but has not, as far as I\nknow, advanced into human trials),\n[repinotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repinotan) (which was taken into the\nclinic for stroke, and failed),\n[piclozotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piclozotan) (which appears to have\nalso failed in a stroke trial),\n[U-92,016-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-92,016-A), also billed as a long-\nacting full selective agonist, which has been around since the early 1990s and\nhas not been developed, GPCR pharmacology is wildly complex, and nowhere more\nso than in the thick forest of serotonin receptor subtypes, so it's certainly\npossible that a new compound could show a different profile. But it's anyone's\nguess as to what that profile might be. Just the list of different indications\nthat such compounds are either used for or have been investigated for is\nenough to tell you what the field is like.\n\nI have been unable to find a structure for DSP-1181 - patent applications from\nExscientia are all directed towards machine learning techniques, and there is\nnothing I have found from Sumitomo/Dainippon on 5-HT1a. Although if that\ncompound really is such new chemical matter, presumably a patent application\nhasn't even published yet. When it does, or when the structure is revealed in\na presentation, I will be very interested to see how closely it might resemble\nexisting chemical matter.\n\nBack the the mode of action. I used that word \"guess\" deliberately. For CNS\ndrug discovery, that's all we've got, AI or no AI. There is simply not enough\nreliable information to feed into even the greatest artificial intelligence\nsoftware in the world to allow one to predict what will happen against\nconditions like OCD, depression, anxiety, and other high-level human\npsychiatric conditions. And that is the problem. Drugs fail in Phase II\nbecause we have not picked the right target, because our biochemical\nunderstanding of the disease state is wrong and/or incomplete. They also fail\nin Phase III for that reason and for unexpected toxicity, and the situation\nwith tox is the same as for CNS efficacy: no amount of artificial intelligence\nis yet sufficient to tell you whether you're going to run into such problems.\nMaybe eventually, but not yet. Those of you who remember Isaac Asimov's \"[The\nLast Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question)\" will recall\nthe phrase \"Insufficient data for a meaningful answer\", and that's exactly the\nsituation.\n\nHere's my take, then: Exscientia may well have moved a compound along at high\nspeed into the clinic. But this particular example is not going to accelerate\ndrug discovery much, because this is speeding up a minor part of the process\nand (for this target and indication) one that is nowhere near a rate-limiting\nstep. We already have a whole range of 5-HT1a compounds, and we already have\nhad (for many years) the idea that they might have applications in OCD. This\nproject, at best, seems to me to have saved a few months off the process of\nsending their compound into the same black-box shredder as every such drug\nproject goes into when it hits human trials. At this point, I believe they are\nnow in the same situation as everyone else, which means a >90% chance of\nfailure - honestly, CNS indications like this are more like 95%. AI has not\nchanged that. I hope it does eventually. But it hasn't yet.\n\n##  41 comments on \"Another AI-Generated Drug?\"\n\n  1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa690405a36fa688742ff24607eb7a94?s=32&d=mm&r=g) anon says:\n\n[ 31 January, 2020 at 9:44\nam](//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/31/another-ai-generated-\ndrug#comment-312093)\n\nCan we generate AI human being to test AI generated drug?

Back in my big pharma days, which is to say a few years ago, I had the\nthrill of leading a project to take two known compounds to the clinic in under\na year! Because someone higher up said it should be possible. Really it should\nbe possible. Two known compounds, bulk material was already made, what could\ngo wrong!  \nSo we set out, lean mean machine team.

How advanced was the starting point before AI\ngot involved? How many chemists were assigned to this program to accelerate it\nbecause it was a collaboration in a hyped area? I was involved myself with a\nsimilar collaboration with this company on another target. Folks on the team\nsaw nothing much out of the ordinary but that didn't stop other, wiser, more\nsenior people declaring it a great success.\n\n[Reply](//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/31/another-ai-\ngenerated-drug?replytocom=312247#respond)\n\n  25. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7733c7ac104d3c0b3e0e1e1d4337424b?s=32&d=mm&r=g) MoMo says:\n\n[ 6 February, 2020 at 11:21\nam](//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/31/another-ai-generated-\ndrug#comment-312276)\n\nThat's what this industry does best Condescending Ape- They Hype everything on\nthe business level, misrepresent themselves on the science while the\nscientists and clinicians cringe, then wonder why they are caught up in bad\npress, revenue loss, market cap implosion, and SEC and class action suits.\n\nBut once in a while a great drug emerges and human suffering is alleviated for\na time.\n\nAI is hyped now as other innovations have been in the past, and its the cycle\nof life in this Industry.\n\n[Reply](//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/31/another-ai-\ngenerated-drug?replytocom=312276#respond)\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/pipeline/archives/2020/01/31/another-ai-\ngenerated-drug#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

CEO Brad Hoover said the fresh\ncapital, which brings Grammarly\u2019s total raised to date to roughly $200 million\nfollowing a $110 million raise in May 2017, will be used to advance its\ntechnology to build a full-fledged communications assistant. He also said\nit\u2019ll enable Grammarly to expand the size of its workforce globally, which now\nnumbers north of 200 employees.\n\n\u201cCommunication is a fundamental human need that helps us all connect and\nthrive,\u201d said Hoover. \u201cBut effective communication requires talent and time,\nand it can be very challenging. Grammarly\u2019s AI fills this gap by empowering\npeople worldwide \u2014 both native and non-native English writers, for personal,\nprofessional, and academic reasons \u2014 to communicate clearly and effectively.\u201d\n\nGeneral Catalyst managing director Hemant Taneja added, \u201cWe first invested in\nGrammarly to help them evolve into a platform that could improve written\ncommunication everywhere it happens. The company\u2019s ability to attract the\ntalent needed to grow that platform continues to impress us, and today we\u2019re\nexcited to increase our investment to achieve their worthy mission.\u201d\n\nGrammarly \u2014 the brainchild of Kyiv, Ukraine-based developers Alex Shevchenko,\nMax Lytvyn, and Dmytro Lider \u2014 was founded in 2009 as Sentenceworks shortly\nafter the sale of Lytvyn and Shevchenko\u2019s plagiarism-checking MyDropBox to\neducational services company Blackboard. One of its first products was a\nbarebones WYSIWYG editor into which users could paste text, which evolved into\na web app that provided itemized lists of spelling and syntax suggestions.\n\n![Grammarly Google Docs](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/082918-Comms-GDocs-\nHDR.png?w=800&resize=800%2C393&strip=all)![Grammarly Google\nDocs](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/082918-Comms-GDocs-\nHDR.png?w=800&resize=800%2C393&strip=all)\n\n[![VB TRansform 2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15\n- 16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)![VB TRansform\n2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15 -\n16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)](https://www.vbtransform.com/)\n\nBy 2011, Grammarly, which early on tailored its technology to educational\ninstitutions, counted 300,000 students as registered users and more than 250\nuniversities as customers. In the next year, it was reportedly pulling in $10\nmillion in revenue annually. By 2013, Grammarly achieved 2,326% revenue growth\nfrom 2009, with over 3 million registered users. In 2015, Grammarly hit 1\nmillion daily active users. At time of its first funding round in May 2017,\nthis figure was at 6.9 million \u2014 and tripled by this year, now at more than 20\nmillion.\n\nSometime in 2012, Grammarly pivoted away from academic segments to the broader\nconsumer market, which it pursued with gusto. It rolled out an $11.99 per\nmonth subscription plan with an annual tier and a seven-day trial, and it\nbegan marketing heavily on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, and\nYouTube. (Last year, Grammarly\u2019s \u201cEnhance Your Writing\u201d ad topped YouTube\u2019s\nTrueView for Action leaderboard, which took into account the spot\u2019s total\nreach, clicks, and engagement.)\n\nGrammarly in 2014 launched plugins for Microsoft Office that integrated its\ngrammar checker directly with Outlook and Word, and in 2015, it launched the\nGrammarly browser extension for Chrome and Safari. A Firefox extension\nfollowed shortly afterward, as did an add-on for Google Docs and the message-\nand email-scanning Grammarly Keyboard for iOS and Android.\n\nGrammarly\u2019s suite of clients is free, but some core features \u2014 including style\nrecommendations, plagiarism detection, and a subset of over 400-plus language\nchecks \u2014 are gated behind the aforementioned paywall.\n\n![Grammarly tone detector](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Grammarly-Tone-Detector-\nExample-1.gif?w=800&resize=800%2C413&strip=all)![Grammarly tone\ndetector](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Grammarly-Tone-\nDetector-Example-1.gif?w=800&resize=800%2C413&strip=all)\n\nToday, Grammarly offers its entry-level Grammarly Premium service for $30 a\nmonth (or $140 a year), while the enterprise-oriented Grammarly Business tier\nstarts at $15 per user per month. Both add style and vocabulary\nrecommendations across all platforms, as well as a [tone\ndetector](https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/24/grammarly-uses-ai-to-detect-the-\ntone-and-tenor-of-your-writing/) that can identify subtle contextual clues\nconveying a range of tempers. Currently in beta for all Grammarly users, the\ntone detector attempts to suss out the sentiment of any email, document, or\nblog post at least 120 characters in length. Recognized tones include\n\u201cfriendly,\u201d \u201cjoyful,\u201d \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cannoyed,\u201d and \u201cexcited,\u201d among 35 others.\n\nSign up for

 Forget AI in healthcare, augmented intelligence and distributed ledger\ntechnology will transform healthcare\n\nInformation Age spoke to United Nations advisor Dr. Anushka Patchava on why\nthe sector is not ready for artificial intelligence just yet and instead\naugmented intelligence and distributed ledger technology are more exciting\nright now. ![Forget AI in healthcare, augmented intelligence and distributed\nledger technology will transform healthcare image](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_232993142-1024x440.jpeg)\n\nWe don't need artificial intelligence in healthcare we need augmented\nintelligence\n\n\u201cHealthcare is not like banking,\u201d says Dr. [Anushka\nPatchava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dranushka-patchava61285/), Expert\nAdviser to the United Nations. \u201cRather it\u2019s a more emotional business.\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare implies the use of\u2026non-human systems,\nlike computers, performing tasks such as decision-making, without a human\ntouch. With healthcare, we aren\u2019t there yet. Although artificial intelligence\ncan solve some of the problems, for example within the supply chain\u2013 augmented\nintelligence is more applicable clinically.\u201d As for data, Patchava explained\nwhy distributed ledger is an exciting solution, promoting data fluidity across\nsystems, networks and services.\n\nPatchava, who is speaking at the upcoming [Tech Leaders Summit in London on 12\nSeptember](/event/tech-leaders-summit-awards/), puts emphasis on the human\nfactor. \u201cIn banking,\u201d she said, \u201cit's very much about being low touch, high\ntech, and that's acceptable because people want that. They seek convenience;\naccess as and when they want it and as quickly and effectively as possible.\nConsumer experience is scored on first call resolution. They almost don't want\nto have to deal with a human, it\u2019s time-consuming and often a distractor,\nrather than enabler. Whereas in healthcare it's actually the flip of that.\nConsumers are in a different mental mindset. The sick patient seeks empathy\nand reassurance. In fact, it is the trigger of these two feelings that has\nbeen proven to help healing. The psychology, physiology and pathology of\nhealthcare consumers (or patients as we know them) is ever complex, and to\ndate, strongly benefits from human interaction.\u201d\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_87101043-1024x440-1-150x150.jpeg)Healthtech\n> valuations reach five year high\n>\n> [Healthtech valuations reach a five-year high, maybe healthtech has moved up\n> the hype curve to the promised land](/healthtech-valuations-123485206/)\n\n\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-150x150.jpg)Dr. Anushka Patchava: We don't want\n> to completely replace doctors and healthcare workers; we need to find\n> synergistic partnerships\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, however (and as Jane Austin once\nsaid), that globally, health systems face several challenges. Ageing\npopulations, the rise of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes,\ncardiovascular disease and spiralling consumer expectations all create an\nenormous burden on health care providers. Traditionally, large scale, wide-\nreach adoption of new technologies within health systems and amongst health\nprofessionals has been a huge barrier. If applied well, emerging technologies\ncan help take away some of the strain, shifting care from reactive to\nproactive, and from treatment to prevention. Critically for these technologies\nto succeed, they need to be embedded within the workflow, driving productivity\nwithout at the same time sacrificing the human touch.\u2019\n\nTake artificial intelligence in healthcare. \u201cWe don't want to completely\nreplace doctors and healthcare workers; we need to find synergistic\npartnerships, where it's neither high touch/low touch or low tech/high touch,\nit's tech and touch working in combination to deliver the best outcomes for\nboth physician and patient.\u201d\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-use-cases-\n> artificial-intelligence-healthcare-1024x440-150x150.jpeg)How AI is\n> revolutionising healthcare: 10 use cases of artificial intelligence in\n> healthcare\n>\n> [The growth of artificial intelligence is evidential.

In the right hands of doctors, nurses, hospital managers and\nporters, [Medic Bleep enables a efficient communication\nflow](https://www.medicbleep.com/features.html), of events and information as\nit happens. Results from a recent time-motion analysis revealed nurses saved\nan average of 21 minutes per shift whereas doctors saved an average of 48\nminutes per shift \u2013 highly impactful when you think about what that equates to\nin a week, a month and a year. Furthermore, technologies like this can drive\nimproved work prioritisation, easier collaboration, and through provision of\nan auditable record reduce errors and adverse incidents. Who would say no to\nsafer and more efficient care delivery?\n\nShe envisions the Medic Bleep technology extending to emergency teams across\nmultiple healthcare networks \u2014not just a single hospital \u2014 and even onto\nsocial care \u201cso that healthcare professionals can have a real-time view of\nhealth services and patients, who require care across the continuum, don\u2019t\nhave to worry about their results being transferred from doctor to social\nworker.\u2019\n\n\u2018We know Matt Hancock (the UK\u2019s Secretary of State for Health and Social Care)\nhas been really pushing the agenda to convert hospital pagers \u2013 and Medic\nBleep provides a powerful solution, perpetuating real-time communication (and\ndata flow) across health, and one day perhaps even social and emergency, care\nservices.\u2019\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barrier-ai-\n> adoption-healthcare-1013x440-150x150.jpeg)What's the biggest barrier to AI\n> adoption in healthcare?\n>\n> [Lauren Maffeo, associate principal analyst at GetApp, explores the biggest\n> barrier to AI adoption in healthcare](/barrier-ai-adoption-\n> healthcare-123484082/)\n\n## The challenge of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and why we call it\naugmented intelligence\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-150x150.jpg)Dr. Anushka Patchava: Real, true,\n> artificial intelligence is almost always, at least in my lifetime, going to\n> be non-existent in clinical care\n\nNot so long ago, IBM\u2019s AI engine, Watson, was being heralded as a panacea to\nhealthcare. But \u201cWatson has failed as a business unit,\u201d says Patchava, \u201cand I\nthink the reason why the technology hasn't achieved it\u2019s potential and failed\nto impress is primarily because they didn't understand the problem they were\ntrying to solve. It\u2019s hard to illustrate the complexity that exists within\nhealthcare. There are so many stakeholders, touchpoints, disease areas and\ntreatment options to name a few. Furthermore, if you think of each healthcare\npain-point; it can exist at an individual level, at a population level, and/or\nat a system level - it\u2019s a very intricate network.\u2019\n\n\u201cReal, true, artificial intelligence is almost always, at least in my\nlifetime, going to be non-existent in clinical care. Although there are\nseveral areas where machine learning could be deployed to improve system\nprocesses, the unknowability of how output is derived from input and the\noverreliance on clinical decision support systems remain unsolved ethical\ndilemmas, slowing the replacement of humans in healthcare. For example, if I\nhave a breast mammogram, although perhaps 6 or 7 times out of 10, AI may be\nable to detect breast cancer accurately, if my scan fell into the 3 or 4 out\nof 10 deemed \u2018ambigious\u2019 I would most certainly want a human to take a look,\nconsult me, and reassure me of my diagnosis. Recent advances in AI algorithms\nhave narrowed the gap between computers and human experts in detecting breast\ncancer, however we hold computers to a different standard. Although systems\nmay, satisfy Turing\u2019s test (the ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour\nequivalent to, or indistinguishable from that of a human), would patients\n(consumers) accept this? I believe if computers are to replace humans in\nhealthcare, this substitution would have to prove improved accuracy, not\nmerely equivalence.\u2019\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/IoMT-1024x440-150x150.jpg)How IoT \u2013 and IoMT \u2013 is\n> changing the face of medicine and healthcare today\n>\n> [The IoT -- and IoMT -- will ensure significant streamlining in healthcare,\n> meaning the best possible results for everyone](/iot-and-iomt-123482481/)\n\n## Artificial intelligence and healthcare \u2013 where is there value?\n\n\u201cThe computer is never going to know a human entirely. Algorithms and code\ncannot truly replicate human conscious and subconscious behaviour, attitudes,\nideas and expectations. However, one area where machine learning is\nsignificantly evolving is genomics - the study of a complete set of genes, an\norganism\u2019s make-up\u2019. \u2018The use of artificial intelligence to make sequencing\nand analysing DNA faster, cheaper, more accurate and more available could have\nsignificant implications on the way we deliver healthcare\u2019. Through genomics\nwe can achieve a deeper understanding of an organism\u2019s behaviour \u2013 for example\nwhat diseases they are susceptible to, and use this to make decisions about\ntheir care. Earlier we spoke about the shift from treatment to prevention, and\ngenomics forms the missing piece to both parts. Pharmacogenomics can help us\nunderstand how an individual may react to certain drugs, driving\npersonalisation of therapy. In turn, it can also help prepare for the future.\nFor example, if someone is at high risk of diabetes, but is not yet diabetic,\nwe can offer them a greater level of targeted interventions to reduce risk\nand/or prevent catastrophic events \u2013 overall reducing cost, and improving\noutcomes.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think genomics is going to push the future of medicine whereby we can\ndeliver tailored and personalised services, however I also think genomics is\nnever going to be the full answer. I\u2019d still want a doctor, or at least\nhealthcare professional to interpret my results, counsel me through what to\nexpect, and formulate a treatment/action plan taking into account my concerns\nand preferences. As doctors, we must remember, the patient is one that is sat\nin front of you, not just the algorithm or piece of code.\u2019\n\nThe technical potential for automation differs significantly across\nindustries. \u201cThe financial services industry has been far superior in\ncapturing and utilising our data, in person and more recently digitally. By\ndoing so, they have been able to identify patterns based on for example,\nincome earned, and deploy predictive analytics to forecast consumer behaviour.\nIn healthcare we are slightly further behind, with somewhat still disparate\nand fragmented data sets peppered across health systems. To be effective, not\nonly do we need to bring together existing data sets at an individual and\npopulation level, but we also need to obtain a a far deeper, more holistic\npicture of a person\u2019s wellness, not just sickness. This is where new\ntechnologies such as wearables and connected devices can help fill some of the\ngaps \u2013 providing healthcare professionals and systems with larger, broader\ndata sources, which in turn can improve algorithms and predictability. Only\nthen can we shift healthcare from \u2018sick care\u2019 to \u2018health care\u2019.\u2019\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Digital-\n> integration-1012x440-150x150.jpg)Digital integration of healthcare means\n> empowering patients and clinicians\n>\n> [Dr Bayju Thakar, former NHS doctor and founder of Doctor Care Anywhere,\n> explains the benefits of digital integration in primary and secondary\n> care](/digital-integration-of-healthcare-123482035/)\n\n## Enter DLT for healthcare\n\nIn most cases, if you hear the word blockchain, you immediately think of\nbitcoin, and some may even affiliate this to the dark web, money laundering,\nscams, gambling and such likes. So, let\u2019s decouple this \u2013 move away from\ncalling it blockchain and consider the potential of the underlying technology\ndistributed ledger technology, or DLT.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve talked about obtaining more data \u2013 to help decision making. However a\nkey challenge in healthcare, and health systems globally is data fluidity.\nBarriers, regulation, policy and processes prevent data flow not only within\nthe system, but also between\u2019\n\n\u201cRight now, you go to your GP. Guess what? Your GP doesn\u2019t know you were\nadmitted into hospital last week and has not received your recent test\nresults. You have to then call the clinic to find out where these are. If\nyou\u2019re lucky, after ten minutes of holding and a further twenty minutes of\nconversation you manage to have your results emailed, more likely faxed to\nyour local GP practice. And now, you have to make another appointment because\nby doing this, your 10-minute appointment time is up. Now imagine if you had\nmore complex needs, suppose you needed social care on discharge \u2013 and the\ninformation hasn\u2019t reached social care. So you either never get your carer at\nhome, causing you much difficulty and inconvenience or worse yet, you end up\nback in hospital because you are unable to cope.\u2019 You can see almost\nimmediately how the lack of data fluidity can have serious impact, to patient\noutcomes, to healthcare professional decision-making and to system costs.\u2019\n\n\u201cElectronic health records were never designed to manage multi-institutional\nlife time medical records. As it stands, patients scatter their health data\nacross various organisations, pharmacies, fitness centres, hospitals, clinics\nas their health journey evolves from one institutes data silo into another.\nWhat we need to solve for, across healthcare professionals, technology\ncompanies, data scientists and managers, is how do we perpetuate data flow?\nHow do we enable systems to talk to one another, transferring accurate\ninterpretable data between themselves without adding a huge cost to already\ndiminishing budgets?\u2019. This is where DLT may have potential.\n\n\u201cAt the moment? With current systems, even though we may capture data, this\ncould be held in different electronic health records \u2013 with no communicating\nlayer in between. Without data flow, no one person has a full holistic picture\nof their patient.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo although the intention is there, to use data from wide and varied sources\nincluding pharmacogenomics, wearables, Alexa, Google Home - to drive better\nhealthcare decision making and outcomes \u2013 we still need to crack how we\neffectively allow the right people access to this data, at the right time.\u2019\n\n\u201cUnless we have access to the holistic data set, all that data in one place,\nour ability to analyse and draw meaningful insights is restricted. How can we\naccurately train computers (machine learning) without providing the full\npicture?\u2019\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_248480244-1013x440-150x150.jpeg)Robotic\n> process automation in healthcare will lead to better patient outcomes\n>\n> [Robotic process automation in healthcare: Software bots represent a\n> powerful digital workforce that can work tirelessly in the background\n> supporting doctors and administrators, says Henry Xie, is the CEO and\n> founder at Simple Fractal](/robotic-process-automation-rpa-\n> healthcare-123479108/)\n\n## The DLT stone-age\n\nWhile organisations like [MedicalChain](https://medicalchain.com/en/) are\ndeploying distributed ledger technology to partially solve for\ninteroperability issues, , providing immutable trust and distributed secure\naccess to patient longtitudinal health data, she feels that as it exists\ncurrently, the technology is still in the \u2018dial-up\u2019 internet phase; a nod to\nthe time when logging onto the internet involved a modem connected to your\ntelephone circuit, dialling onto the internet via the telephone at local call\nrate. It was slow, and terribly frustrating.\n\nEventually, with iteration and evolution she sees DLT as something that is\njust there, existing in the infrastructure across sectors \u2014 like the\ncarburettor in the car. People might say \u2018I\u2019ve got a new car\u2019, they might say\n\u2018 I\u2019ve got a BMW car\u2019 what they don\u2019t say is \u2018I\u2019ve got a BMW car and then tell\nyou about the engine type, power, operating mechanism etc.\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere are still several challenges to overcome. Firstly, we've needed to go\nthrough almost a conscious de-coupling of DLT from blockchain in order to\ninitiate conversations about DLT in the first place. We are that point right\nnow, across forward thinking health systems, whereby there is interest\npeppered with enthusiasm from early adopters. However, we can\u2019t replace the\nentire legacy infrastructure of a hospital that's existed over decades? And\nnot without significant investment (which in this country hospitals just don\u2019t\nhave) and then causing severe disruption to operations in the process.\n\n> ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-proof-our-\n> NHS-1012x440-2-150x150.jpg)Laying the foundations to future-proof our NHS\n> and power UK HealthTech\n>\n> **[Following Matt Hancock's recent app-focused policy paper on the future of\n> health, Afshin Attari, Director of Public Sector at Exponential-e, argues\n> why it's no use championing new technologies such as video consultations or\n> curative chatbots if the right infrastructure isn't in place to support\n> it](/future-proof-our-nhs-123477581/)**\n\n\u201cSo the challenge is identifying where and how do you use DLT amongst the\nlegacy infrastructure to improve efficiency of already existing processes.\n\n\u201cWe've come to the philosophy that DLT in it\u2019s first instance could be\nregarded as a \u2018plug and play\u2019 technology. One that is recognised by the\nexisting system and is able to replace part of the existing system without\njeopardising integrity, functionality, or reliability of the existing system.\"\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\n> content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-150x150.jpg)Dr. Anushka Patchava: Through\n> identifying a small pain-point, and solving for this, they've done really\n> well proving if we find the right use cases for DLT, it doesn't have to\n> replace the entire hospital infrastructure\n\nShe cites the example of [Dovetail Lab](https://www.dovetaillab.com/), \u201cThey,\nworking together with Surgical Consent, have pioneered a shared decision-\nmaking platform of which a paperless, personalised consent form can be used to\nconsent for elective surgery, based on 'distributed ledger technology.\u2019 The\nvision here is to create a fully consented database of personal preferences,\nrisks and benefits associated with different treatments, decisions made,\nactions taken and patient reported experience and outcomes. Over time, there\nis potential for this to capture more than just consent \u2013 interoperating with\nthe existing patient record \u2013 and contributing to machine learning to ensure\neach decision is the right one for that patient.\n\n\u201cThrough identifying a small pain-point, and solving for this, they've done\nreally well proving if we find the right use cases for DLT, it doesn't have to\nreplace the entire hospital infrastructure, but can operate in conjunction\nwith all the other layers in the hospital infrastructure \u2013 a better business\ncase to take to the board. Through small use cases, and incremental\nimprovements we can drive adoption; and only through these deployments can we\ntest, understand, iterate and improve the technology for purpose.\"\n\n[AI neural network health-tech tool may solve health tech IP/collaboration\ndilemma](/ai-neural-network-health-tech-ip-collaboration-123475692/)\n\n[AI in healthcare: Can AI solve the health tech puzzle of new drug\ndiscovery?](/ai-in-healthcare-123475665/)\n\n[AI and machine learning needed to improve the healthcare industry](/ai-\nmachine-learning-healthcare-industry-123475526/)\n\n[What is the potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare?](/potential-\nartificial-intelligence-healthcare-123473784/)\n\n[How cloud technology is transforming the healthcare industry](/cloud-\ntechnology-transforming-healthcare-industry-123472352/)\n\n  * [ __](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.information-age.com%2Faugmented-intelligence-distributed-ledger-technology-healthcare-123485246%2F&t=Forget%20AI%20in%20healthcare%2C%20augmented%20intelligence%20and%20distributed%20ledger%20technology%20will%20transform%20healthcare)\n  * [ __](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.information-age.com%2Faugmented-intelligence-distributed-ledger-technology-healthcare-123485246%2F&title=Forget%20AI%20in%20healthcare%2C%20augmented%20intelligence%20and%20distributed%20ledger%20technology%20will%20transform%20healthcare)\n  * [ __](http://twitter.com/share?text=Forget%20AI%20in%20healthcare%2C%20augmented%20intelligence%20and%20distributed%20ledger%20technology%20will%20transform%20healthcare&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.information-age.com%2Faugmented-intelligence-distributed-ledger-technology-healthcare-123485246%2F&via=InformationAge)\n  * [ __](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.information-age.com%2Faugmented-intelligence-distributed-ledger-technology-healthcare-123485246%2F&t=Forget%20AI%20in%20healthcare%2C%20augmented%20intelligence%20and%20distributed%20ledger%20technology%20will%20transform%20healthcare)\n  * [ __](http://www.printfriendly.com/print?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.information-age.com%2Faugmented-intelligence-distributed-ledger-technology-healthcare-123485246%2F&title=Forget%20AI%20in%20healthcare%2C%20augmented%20intelligence%20and%20distributed%20ledger%20technology%20will%20transform%20healthcare)\n  * __\n\n### A Leader\u2019s Guide to Innovation Systems\n\n  \n\nThe pace of change has never been this fast, yet it will never be this slow\nagain.\n\n  \n[Download now](https://www.information-age.com/downloads/a-leaders-guide-to-\ninnovation-systems/?source=sidebar)\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/wp-ia-\ntheme/image/divider-4-col.png)\n\n  * [How your business can succeed in a digital transformation project](https://www.information-age.com/how-your-business-can-succeed-digital-transformation-project-123488683/)\n  * [Corona-AI project empowers smartphone users to aid COVID-19 research](https://www.information-age.com/corona-ai-project-empowers-smartphone-users-aid-covid-19-research-123488877/)\n  * [DWFRS secures on-vehicle mobile devices with Absolute Software](https://www.information-age.com/dwfrs-secures-on-vehicle-mobile-devices-with-absolute-software-123488869/)\n  * [What are the five main barriers to digital transformation and their solutions?](https://www.information-age.com/what-are-five-main-barriers-to-digital-transformation-solutions-123488853/)\n  * [Covid-19 remote working sparks security fears for most decision makers](https://www.information-age.com/covid-19-remote-working-sparks-security-fears-for-most-decision-makers-123488864/)\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [ __ 2.5k Followers ](https://www.facebook.com/informationage/)\n  * [ __ 16.1k Followers ](https://twitter.com/InformationAge)\n  * [ __ 2.5k Followers ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/information-age/)\n  * [ __ 169 Followers ](https://www.youtube.com/informationage)\n\n### Sign up for Information Age Newsletters\n\n  * Newsletter type*\n\n    * Weekly Tech News\n    * Event Updates\n\n  * Email*\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n## Latest news\n\n[](https://www.information-age.com/how-your-business-can-succeed-digital-\ntransformation-project-123488683/ \"How your business can succeed in a digital\ntransformation project\") ![divider](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/wp-ia-theme/image/divider-4-col.png)\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n![How your business can succeed in a digital transformation\nproject](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/how-your-business-\ncan-succeed-digital-transformation-projects-512x220.jpeg)\n\n###  How your business can succeed in a digital transformation project\n\n8 April 2020 / Running a successful business digital transformation project\nshould be a key initiative in many organisations.

2019.\n\nImage Credit: Michael O'Donnell / VentureBeat\n\nThe AI event of the year for business leaders, [Transform\n2020](https://www.vbtransform.com/?utm_source=VB&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=Transform)\ndoubles down on results-driven content that helps executives at the senior\ndirector level and above maintain their competitive edge. Expect two days of\nthe most transformative trends in conversational AI, computer vision, IoT and\nAI at the edge, and automation, plus a special emphasis on women in AI,\ndiversity, and expanded networking opportunities, this July 15-16 in San\nFrancisco.\n\nEach year, we gather corporate decision-makers from around the world to\ndiscuss \u201cbig picture\u201d trends within artificial intelligence, as well as\npractical ways to move the needle on implementing AI. In 2020, we\u2019re looking\nat the effects of AI through the lens of four key industries: retail, health,\nfinance, and industrial/manufacturing.\n\nThis year\u2019s conference builds on feedback from Transform 2019 with deeper\ndives, a Tech Showcase for the best AI, and more time for conversation. Track\nsessions will be longer for in-depth discussions on what works and what\ndoesn\u2019t and will include practical advice from the trenches. The Tech Showcase\nis raising the bar to identify the most exciting companies with truly unique\nofferings in AI. And to facilitate more dialogue and idea exchanges, we\u2019re\ncreating more time for Q&A with speakers and for overall networking. Don\u2019t\nmiss your chance to join the discussion \u2014 [register here\nnow](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/venturebeat-transform-2020-accelerating-\nyour-business-with-ai-tickets-70048863035?aff=TransformOverview).\n\nIf you represent a leading company or brand that\u2019s applying AI and seeing\nreal-world results, share your story by [applying to be a\nspeaker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nW6d_OLMZb_tYfd9sVcjLc7Q4ajo0o3ptgw0AfrsxaI/viewform?edit_requested=true).\n\n## The trends powering enterprise AI\n\nLast year\u2019s event brought together over 1,000 people to discuss [enterprise AI\nand its effect on the real world](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/12/ai-\nweekly-highlights-from-venturebeats-ai-conference-transform/). This year, we\nhave tightened the focus to what we see as the four most vital areas of\nimplementation: conversational AI, computer vision, AI at the edge, and\nautomation.\n\n[![VB TRansform 2020: The AI event for business leaders.

Presentations will\ncover key advancements in natural language processing (NLP), natural language\nunderstanding (NLU), voice, and text, as well as real-world use cases with\nproven business ROI. Indeed, it\u2019s so vital that we are hosting our second\nannual [Conversational AI Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/venturebeat-\ntransform-2020-accelerating-your-business-with-ai-\ntickets-70048863035?aff=ConversationalAI), taking over the main stage at\nTransform 2020.\n\n### Computer vision comes into focus\n\nIndustry experts expect computer vision to remain a key trend in AI, with\nimproved accuracy in the detection of people and objects. A number of sectors\nare investing in and benefiting from advances in computer vision, including\necommerce, security, health care, transport/logistics, and more. Speakers will\ndiscuss the latest technological capabilities and share use cases.\n\n### Automation makes its mark\n\nThis track will cover a range of AI capabilities and technologies, including\nthe latest on robotic process automation (RPA), automated machine learning\n(AutoML), predictive AI, and more. In addition, presenters will address\nenterprise-wide adoption, integration, and implementation, from finding and\nlanding talent to keeping on the right side of the law and public opinion.\n\n### IoT and AI stretches to the edge\n\nWith 5G on the way, and the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors on the\nnetwork, companies are increasingly seeking to run AI technologies on the\n\u201cedge.\u201d Drivers include reduced latency compared to the cloud, increased\nsecurity, and better privacy protection. To address challenges and\nopportunities, ecosystem players will share key insights on what\u2019s next.\n\n## Special VIP events within Transform 2020\n\nTo cap off Transform 2020, VentureBeat will recognize and award emergent,\ncompelling, and influential work in AI, drawn from our daily editorial\ncoverage, with the AI Innovation Awards on Wednesday evening. But since\ntechnology cannot be truly transformative without a wide perspective, we\u2019re\nholding special events to reflect the work being done by women and other\nunderrepresented groups and provide focused networking opportunities.\n\n### AI Innovation Awards dinner\n\nBeyond all the panels, discussions, fireside chats, and networking at\nTransform 2020, VentureBeat will present the 2nd annual **AI Innovation\nAwards** on Wednesday, July 15. These awards honor emergent, compelling, and\ninfluential work in AI. VentureBeat\u2019s nominating committee \u2014 including Claire\nDelaunay, vice president of engineering at Nvidia; Asli Celikyilmaz, principal\nresearcher at Microsoft Research; and Hilary Mason, former GM of machine\nlearning at Cloudera \u2014 will select the most disruptive innovators in AI.\n[Network with fellow VIPs](https://www.vbtransform.com/ai-innovation-awards)\nat this very special awards gathering.\n\n### Women taking the lead in AI\n\nVentureBeat is opening Transform 2020 with an invite-only **Women in AI\nBreakfast** on Wednesday, July 15 that will focus on the growing roles of\nwomen in the industry. Last year\u2019s conference introduced a new focus on\nimproving the representation of women in AI, and over 200 women mingled and\nnetworked at the [Transform 2019 Women in AI\nBreakfast](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/10/takeaways-from-the-inaugural-\nwomen-in-ai-breakfast-at-transform-2019/).\n\n\u201cJust starting the entire conference off with that level of sisterhood was one\nof the things I\u2019ve never seen at a tech conference, and I\u2019ve been to many,\u201d\nsaid Transform 2019 attendee Nicole Alexander, SVP and chief innovation expert\nat Ipsos. To request an invitation to this year\u2019s breakfast, apply\n[here](https://www.vbtransform.com/womeninaibreakfast).\n\nThe 2nd annual **Women in AI awards** will be given out on Thursday, July 16.\nCategories for the first annual [Women in AI\nawards](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/12/winners-of-venturebeats-first-\nwomen-in-ai-awards-announced-at-transform-2019/) included Responsibility and\nEthics of AI; AI Entrepreneur; AI Research; AI Mentorship; and the Rising Star\nAward.

From image recognition to sophisticated\nalgorithms to workforce dynamics and startup equity investment, the impact of\ndiversity and inclusion cannot be overstated.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Transform 2020 is focused on bringing more\ndiverse groups, including people of color, to the AI conversation. Learn how\nyour organization can build diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and\nnetwork with over 100 talented Black American, Latinx, and female attendees at\nour July 16 **Diversity Cocktail Reception**.\n\n## Expo to showcase groundbreaking technology\n\nEach year, **Transform\u2019s Expo** gives innovative companies that are breaking\nground in AI a chance to get in front of the valuable Transform audience and\nimpress senior level execs from some of the most notable brands and tech\ncompanies. This year, we\u2019re introducing a special **Startup Expo,** where 50\nfresh new businesses will vie for the chance to present to the Transform 2020\ncrowd.

The system then creates a computer-generated estimate of\nthe candidates\u2019 skills and behaviors, including their \u201cwillingness to learn\u201d\nand \u201cpersonal stability.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCandidates aren\u2019t told their scores, but employers can use those reports to\ndecide whom to hire or disregard. The Utah-based company was the subject of [a\nWashington Post\nreport](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-\nscanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-\njob/?tid=lk_inline_manual_7&itid=lk_inline_manual_7) last month, in which AI\nresearchers criticized its technology as \u201cprofoundly disturbing\u201d and \u201copaque.\u201d\n\n[A face-scanning algorithm increasingly decides whether you deserve the\njob](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-\nscanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-\njob/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_8&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_8)\n\nHireVue\u2019s \u201cintrusive collection and secret analysis of biometric data\u201d causes\nsubstantial privacy and financial harms, EPIC officials wrote. And \u201cbecause\nthese algorithms are secret,\u201d they added, \u201c ... it is impossible for job\ncandidates to know how their personal data is being used or to consent to such\nuses.\u201d\n\nThe FTC declined to comment. HireVue did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe complaint could for the first time throw a federal spotlight on a growing\nindustry of tech firms that advertise automated systems they say can assess\ncandidates\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, divine people\u2019s personalities and pinpoint problematic\nrecruits. Critics say the systems are dehumanizing, invasive and built on\nflawed science that could perpetuate discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nAD\n\nThe technology is also facing increasing pressure from lawmakers. In January,\nIllinois will enact a law forcing employers to tell job applicants and\nregulators how their AI video-interview systems work. Co-sponsors of the\n[bill](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0260),\napproved in August by Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D), said they worried the systems\ncould unfairly penalize candidates and hide biases in how they assess a \u201cmodel\nemployee.\u201d\n\n[\n\nRead the complaint\n\n](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/epic-s-ftc-complaint-about-\nhirevue/9797b738-e36a-4b7a-8936-667cf8748907/)\n\n[Full PDF](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/epic-s-ftc-complaint-about-\nhirevue/9797b738-e36a-4b7a-8936-667cf8748907/)\n\nHireVue\u2019s systems have become pervasive for employers because they can lower\nrecruiting costs and speed up turnaround time for new hires. Some colleges now\ninstruct students on how to impress the hidden algorithms: In the FTC filing,\nEPIC lawyers quote a guide from the University of Maryland business school,\nwhich tells interviewees, \u201cRobots compare you against existing success\nstories; they don\u2019t look for out-of-the-box candidates.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEPIC, based in Washington, has become one of the tech industry\u2019s most renowned\nand effective watchdogs, helping shape U.S. policy around online privacy,\ncivil liberties and domestic surveillance for nearly 25 years. The group has\nchallenged tech giants and government agencies, including Facebook, Google and\nthe National Security Agency, through consumer complaints, agency filings and\nfederal lawsuits.\n\nAD\n\nEPIC urged the FTC to halt HireVue\u2019s automatic scoring of job candidates and\nmake public the algorithms and criteria used in analyzing people\u2019s behavior.\nThe technology is largely unregulated, but the FTC regularly enforces \u201cunfair\nand deceptive acts or practices\u201d statutes against companies found to be making\nclaims to consumers without a \u201creasonable basis\u201d in a way likely to \u201ccause\nsubstantial injury.\u201d\n\n[Wanted: The \u2018perfect babysitter.\u2019 Must pass AI scan for respect and\nattitude.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/16/wanted-\nperfect-babysitter-must-pass-ai-scan-respect-\nattitude/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_21&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_21)\n\nIn its complaint, EPIC officials said HireVue\u2019s AI-driven assessments produce\nresults that are \u201cbiased, unprovable and not replicable.\u201d The system, they\nargued, could unfairly score someone based on prejudices related to their\ngender, race, sexual orientation or neurological differences. HireVue says it\nuses \u201cworld-class bias testing\u201d techniques to detect and prevent hiring\ndiscrimination.\n\nAD\n\nHireVue advertises that its technology does not use \u201cfacial recognition\ntechnology\u201d because its systems do not attempt to identify people. But EPIC\nargued that HireVue\u2019s assertion is misleading, and that the FTC has ruled the\nterm applies to any \u201ctechnologies that analyze facial geometry to predict\ndemographic characteristics, expression or emotions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEPIC also argued that HireVue had failed to meet international standards for\nAI systems set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\nand endorsed by the United States earlier this year. HireVue violated those\nprinciples, EPIC said, because its algorithmic assessments can\u2019t be evaluated\nor \u201cmeaningfully challenged\u201d by the job candidates they\u2019ve assessed.\n\n[This company is training artificial intelligence to scour California's\nforests for potential\nwildfires](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/06/california-\nhas-million-acres-forest-this-company-is-training-artificial-intelligence-\nscour-it-all-\nwildfire/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_27&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_27)\n\nThe company has not ensured the accuracy, reliability or validity of its\ncomputer-generated scores, the complaint added. It has also not \u201cadequately\nevaluated whether the purpose, objectives, and benefits of its algorithmic\nassessments outweigh the risks.\u201d\n\n0 Comments\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n### Coronavirus Updates\n\nFollow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

What\u2019s more, most observers of the 2019 meeting\nfound that it fell a little flat. Headline speakers were underwhelming and\nfailed to live up to the box-office acts of previous years, which included the\nlikes of US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. If\nfuture editions of the gathering are to prove their worth, they will need to\nconsider the concerns of a world growing more antagonistic to the\nglobetrotting elites who have become synonymous with the event.\n\n> The US-China trade war has contributed to an economic slowdown that has\n> taken even the most pessimistic analysts by surprise\n\nNevertheless, many of the chief talking points from previous years remain\nunresolved and are likely to dominate the agenda in 2020. Finding the right\nregulatory balance that can rein in the excesses of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech\ngiants without stifling innovation will undoubtedly be up for discussion once\nagain. Trade tensions, meanwhile, don\u2019t appear to be going anywhere and\nclimate change looks as difficult to solve today as ever.\n\nBut the WEF\u2019s yearly showpiece has never claimed to be able to single-handedly\nsolve the major issues facing our planet. Instead, the gathering of business\nelites, experts and heads of state in Davos, Switzerland, simply aims to\nbetter understand and engage with these challenges. Each year, even if the\nforum only manages to spark one idea that makes the world a better place,\nsurely it must be deemed a success.\n\n**Trading blows**  \nIn 2018, when Trump was in attendance at the WEF Annual Meeting, few would\nhave predicted that the trade war wrangles between China and the US would\nstill be plodding along today. Tariffs remain in place on billions of dollars\u2019\nworth of goods, forcing businesses in both countries to explore new markets,\nmake cutbacks or simply shut up shop. In fact, the only thing that seems to be\ntraded freely between the two superpowers these days is insults.\n\n[The International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest\nestimates](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-trade-gap-\ngrowing-china-war-exports-a9187371.html) indicate that the US-China trade\nconflict could wipe as much as $700bn (\u20ac627.81bn) off the global economy by\n2020. It has reportedly already cost the technology industry $10bn (\u20ac8.97bn)\nand could end up setting back the average US household $460 (\u20ac412.56) a year,\n[according to an\nanalysis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/economy/trade-war-\ncosts.html) by London-based economists Kirill Borusyak and Xavier Jaravel. In\nChina, meanwhile, the spat has contributed to an economic slowdown that has\ntaken even the most pessimistic analysts by surprise. For the business leaders\nand government figures assembled at Davos, resolving the US-China dispute will\nno doubt be a priority.\n\n![](http://www.europeanceo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Davos-stat-\nwarming.png)\n\nFortunately, the WEF has always been unashamedly pro-globalisation. Shortly\nafter the Trump administration extended its tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018,\nthe WEF\u2019s Aditi Verghese and Sean Doherty criticised the decision in an\narticle entitled [_Trade Wars Won\u2019t Fix Globalisation. Here\u2019s\nWhy_](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/trade-wars-wont-fix-\nglobalization-tariffs/). They wrote: \u201cShort-sighted, protectionist measures\nignore and erode the opportunities that [global value chains] provide for\ndriving inclusive and sustainable growth and do nothing to optimise outcomes.\u201d\n\nBut while some parts of the world wait to see what these two global\nsuperpowers will do next, others are keen to get on with things. In Africa,\nfor example, countries are refusing to pull down the shutters and are instead\nopening themselves up to more international trade. Plans are afoot to launch\nthe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a tariff-free continental\nmarket for goods and services that, according to the WEF, would instantly\nbecome the world\u2019s largest trade bloc.\n\nThe AfCFTA will be implemented gradually, but it already has the support of 54\nmembers of the African Union (AU), with the only exception being Eritrea. It\u2019s\nhoped that the free trade area will boost intracontinental trade, which\nremains far below that found in other parts of the world: according to the\nAfrican Export-Import Bank\u2019s [_African Trade Report 2018_](https://s3-eu-\nwest-1.amazonaws.com/demo2.opus.ee/afrexim/African-Trade-Report-2018.pdf),\nintracontinental trade in Africa sits at just 15 percent, far below the\nfigures seen in Asia (58 percent) and Europe (67 percent). Preliminary\nestimates cited in the report suggest the establishment of the AfCFTA could\nsee this figure rise to 52.3 percent by 2022.\n\n\u201c[The AfCFTA] will create jobs and contribute to technology transfer and the\ndevelopment of new skills; it will improve productive capacity and\ndiversification; and it will increase African and foreign investment,\u201d\n[explained UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina\nMohammed](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/dsgsm1303.doc.htm) at the formal\nlaunch of the AfCFTA. \u201cPerhaps most important of all, the [AfCFTA]\ndemonstrates the common will of African countries to work together to achieve\nthe vision of the [AU\u2019s] Agenda 2063: the Africa We Want. It is a tool to\nunleash African innovation, drive growth, transform African economies and\ncontribute to a prosperous, stable and peaceful African continent, as foreseen\nin both Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\u201d\n\nAt the WEF on Africa event held in August, there was much discussion as to why\nAfrica is choosing to integrate its economies at a time when other parts of\nthe world are adopting a more isolationist approach. Crucially, the leaders of\nthe AU are already discussing ways to ensure that the continent\u2019s less\ndeveloped economies \u2013 and, indeed, its poorest citizens \u2013 are not negatively\naffected by a more liberal approach to trade. It\u2019s a topic that will\nundoubtedly be returned to in Davos at the turn of the year.\n\n**Lay down the law**  \nSilicon Valley\u2019s technology giants had their toughest year for a long time in\n2018: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced a grilling from US Congress; Google\nsaw several employee walkouts over the firm\u2019s inadequate response to sexual\nharassment claims; and Apple had to navigate reports that some of its products\nwere susceptible to Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities. Scrutiny of\nsaid tech firms continued into 2019, albeit not to the same degree. In June,\nFacebook decided that its dominance of the social media space was not enough\nand began eyeing the financial services market. Its unveiling of a new digital\ncurrency called Libra, however, was met with a less-than-enthusiastic\nresponse.\n\n> Companies in Europe and the US should be wary of pushing regulators to place\n> technological progress ahead of ethical considerations\n\nReactions to Libra have ranged from the indifferent to the indignant. Some\npredict the currency will have little impact when it launches in 2020, with\ndetractors (such as [_The Week_ \u2019s Jeff\nSpross](https://theweek.com/articles/847800/hard-anything-revolutionary-about-\nfacebooks-libra)) suggesting that it offers few points of difference from\nexisting mobile payment apps. For others, the currency poses a threat to the\nmonetary sovereignty of nation states. That\u2019s certainly the view of the French\nGovernment, which has moved to [block the development of\nLibra](https://gdpr.report/news/2019/09/12/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-\nposes-a-threat-to-monetary-sovereignty/) in Europe.\n\nRegardless of whether Libra goes on to change the world or not, the conflict\nbetween Facebook and France touches upon a broader challenge presented by\ntoday\u2019s rapidly advancing digital economy: how to legislate on new\ndevelopments in a way that protects citizens without stifling innovation. In\naddition to Silicon Valley\u2019s heavy hitters, a number of entrepreneurs and\npioneering start-ups are busy trying to create the next big thing in areas\nlike self-driving vehicles, the Internet of Things and quantum computing. It\nis becoming increasingly clear that regulators will need to grapple with these\ndevelopments sooner rather than later.\n\nDeciding just how obtrusive regulations should be is becoming more difficult.\nNot only is technology advancing rapidly, it is developing all over the world\nand in different regulatory climates. US institutions may determine that\nartificial intelligence (AI) needs another decade of research before it can be\nemployed in, say, the medical field, but if China thinks such delays are\nunnecessary, the US risks falling behind. In today\u2019s winner-takes-all economy,\ncoming second is the same as not being in the race at all.\n\nAlready, China\u2019s less stringent regulatory approach is paying off. The country\nhas quickly become a world leader in genome editing, overtaking the likes of\nJapan and the US, where obtaining government approval for human trials is more\ndifficult. Similarly, China is making impressive strides in terms of AI\ndevelopment. To function effectively, the technology requires reams of data\nthat will allow it to \u2018learn\u2019 the correct way of acting, whether that concerns\nautonomous vehicles, natural language processing or facial recognition. China,\nwhich has a very different attitude to online privacy than countries found in\nthe West, has an advantage here, too.\n\n\u201cOrganisations should work on a responsible privacy programme,\u201d Paul\nBreitbarth, Director of EU Operations and Strategy at Nymity, told _European\nCEO_. \u201cThat means looking at which requirements for privacy and data\nprotection apply to you, in all the jurisdictions where you operate, and to\nimplement policies and procedures to deal with them.\u201d\n\n![](http://www.europeanceo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Davos-stat-world-\npowers.png)\n\n\n\nIn China, however, a responsible privacy programme places national interests\nabove individual ones. [According to a national intelligence law introduced in\n2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-lawmaking/china-\npasses-tough-new-intelligence-law-idUSKBN19I1FW), organisations must support\nand cooperate with government authorities when they request information that\nrelates to national security issues. Critics believe the wording of the law is\nvague enough to permit widespread state surveillance. Businesses all over the\nworld may be trying to win the tech race, but they are not all playing by the\nsame rules.\n\nStill, companies in Europe and the US should be wary of pushing regulators to\nplace technological progress ahead of ethical considerations. Instead, markets\nneed to clearly state that they will not use Chinese technology \u2013 regardless\nof how cheap or effective it is \u2013 if it has been developed using morally\ndubious means. That would send a clear message, while also giving firms a\nfinancial incentive to adopt sound principles.\n\nIf this approach works, then perhaps the future could see western and Chinese\nfirms collaborating on new technology. This may seem unlikely at present, but\nthis is the sort of long-term ambition that those present at Davos should be\nstriving for \u2013 integrating China more closely with the global community.\n\n**The brink of disaster**  \nAs is the case every year, those gathered at the WEF Annual Meeting (many of\nwhom arrive by private jet) will be set the unenviable task of trying to win\nthe fight against global warming. While it is easy to sneer at the jet-set\nelite for not practising what they preach, finger-pointing will achieve little\n\u2013 the time for action is already long overdue.\n\nThroughout 2019, a number of natural disasters provided a reminder of just how\nurgent the situation is. In September, Hurricane Dorian became the strongest\nstorm to ever hit the Bahamas, resulting in [billions of dollars\u2019 worth of\ndamage](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/hurricane-dorian-caused-billions-\nworth-of-damage-in-the-caribbean.html) and leaving at least 67 dead. While\nrising global temperatures do not cause storms like Dorian, they can boost\ntheir intensity. For the strongest storms, [climate scientists have\nfound](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-we-know-about-\nthe-climate-change-hurricane-connection/) that the sustained wind speed\nincreases by approximately eight percent for every one degree Celsius of\nwarming. The surface sea temperatures measured in the area where Dorian formed\nwere higher than usual (especially when compared with pre-industrial levels),\nbut such figures \u2013 and the disasters they engender \u2013 are likely to become the\nnew normal if humans fail to cut their carbon emissions drastically and\nwithout delay.\n\nAlthough the Paris climate accord has been criticised for its ineffectiveness,\nall hope is not lost. Greta Thunberg, a speaker at last year\u2019s WEF Annual\nMeeting, continues to galvanise her supporters by preaching the importance of\nsustainability. It\u2019s a message that national governments have increasingly\nbeen espousing themselves. In both the US and Europe, environmental policies\nare now firmly part of the political conversation: for instance, new European\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen has made the European Green Deal a\ncentral part of her plans in office, which also include making Europe the\nworld\u2019s first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.\n\n\u201cWe must go further \u2013 we must strive for more,\u201d von der Leyen [said in a\nspeech](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-19-4230_en.htm) during\nher candidacy for the commission presidency. \u201cA two-step approach is needed to\nreduce CO2 emissions by 2030 by 50 \u2013 if not 55 \u2013 percent. The EU will lead\ninternational negotiations to increase the level of ambition of other major\neconomies by 2021. Because to achieve real impact, we do not only have to be\nambitious at home \u2013 we have to do that, yes \u2013 but the world has to move\ntogether.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, figures on the political left, such as US\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are pushing their own version of the\nEuropean Green Deal that would reshape the US economy. The Green New Deal, as\nit is known, promises to decarbonise the manufacturing and agriculture\nindustries, build a national energy-efficient smart grid and turn green\ntechnology into a major US export. These proposals are ambitious, but that\u2019s\nbecause they have to be \u2013 according to the Carbon Brief website, even if the\nglobal temperature is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial\nlevels, sea levels will rise some 40cm by 2100, freshwater availability in the\nMediterranean will fall by nine percent and the intensity of heavy rainfall\nwill go up by five percent. If temperatures increase to a greater extent, the\noutcomes are even worse.\n\nDespite the efforts of politicians around the world, the most pessimistic\nestimates indicate that it will not be possible to reduce the planet\u2019s CO2\nemissions quickly enough to avoid catastrophe. Instead, states may need to\ndeploy less conventional solutions to meet their environmental goals. One\noption would be to invest more heavily in carbon capture and storage\ntechnology. This can be used to greatly reduce the CO2 emissions produced by\nthe burning of fossil fuels and, when combined with renewable biomass, can\neven lead to carbon-negative energy. Similarly, several organisations have\ndeveloped methods to remove CO2 from ambient air using an absorption-\ndesorption process.\n\n![](http://www.europeanceo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Davos-stat-\ngrowth.png)\n\nIt is depressing that humanity has treated the planet in such a way that\nsimply reducing fossil fuel usage is unlikely to be enough to sidestep\ndisaster. At this year\u2019s WEF Annual Meeting, talks will once again focus on\nefforts to cut down global greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, though, new\ntechnology may have to come to the rescue.\n\n**Shaky ground**  \nMaking things more difficult is the fact that these challenges must be tackled\nat a time when political and economic stability is far from guaranteed. More\nthan 10 years have passed since the global financial crisis, but the world\neconomy is still suffering a hangover. \u201cCurrent economic momentum remains\nweak, while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing\neconomies are holding countries back from achieving their potential,\u201d [World\nBank Group President David Malpass said in\nJune](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/04/global-\ngrowth-to-weaken-to-26-in-2019-substantial-risks-seen). \u201cIt\u2019s urgent that\ncountries make significant structural reforms that improve the business\nclimate and attract investment. They also need to make debt management and\ntransparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment.\u201d\n\nThe eurozone, for example, is expected to grow by just 1.2 percent across\n2020, while US-China trade tensions threaten to dampen business and investor\nconfidence in both markets for the foreseeable future. Political change may\nprovide a path away from this stagnation: the US presidential election is\nscheduled for late 2020, while the EU has recently appointed new heads of the\nEuropean Commission and European Central Bank. However, as we are all well\naware, politics is always rife with uncertainty. Change can be both positive\nand negative.\n\nAttendees at the 2020 WEF Annual Meeting will be hopeful that fresh leadership\ncan set the planet on a course for closer economic collaboration, stronger\nfinancial stability and longer-term environmental sustainability. If\ndiscussions at Davos can help in any of those areas \u2013 even in some small way \u2013\nthen perhaps the event can recapture some of its lost spark.\n\n## Post navigation\n\n[\n\n###### Previous article\n\n## Tata Steel to cut jobs in Europe as the US-China trade war leaves its mark\n\n](https://www.europeanceo.com/industry-outlook/tata-steel-to-cut-jobs-in-\neurope-as-the-us-china-trade-war-leaves-its-mark/)\n\n[\n\n###### Next article\n\n## Cheesed off: how US tariffs are harming the EU dairy market\n\n](https://www.europeanceo.com/industry-outlook/cheesed-off-how-us-tariffs-are-\nharming-the-eu-dairy-market/)\n\n#### Related:\n\n###\n\n  1.

man\nwho would become his angel investor.\n\n\"He turned up in trainers and a jacket,\" former Morgan Stanley Japan\nSecurities executive director Keisuke Tomimatsu recalled of their initial\nencounter in 2012, sounding slightly offended by Okada's straight-out-of-\nSilicon-Valley casual attire.\n\nSoon, the entrepreneur had the veteran investment banker focused on something\nelse: the mind-blowing possibilities of artificial intelligence. Okada is an\n\"artist,\" Tomimatsu said. \"He can produce one out of zero.\"\n\nAn undisclosed initial investment from Tomimatsu helped Okada get his startup,\nAbeja, off the ground. Today, the company is using AI to change the way\nretailers do business, arming their physical stores with the same valuable\ndata about customer behaviour that e-tailers such as Amazon gather in real\ntime as shoppers browse the internet.\n\nBut Okada has even bigger ambitions -- he wants to change manufacturing,\ncomputing, perhaps even humanity as we know it. \"He wanted to change the\nworld,\" said Tomimatsu, now an Abeja director. \"So I gave him a shot.\"\n\nBig U.S. tech companies seem to share Tomimatsu's faith in Okada. Abeja counts\nGoogle, graphics chip maker Nvidia and cloud software company Salesforce.com\namong its backers. All told, the venture has raised more than 6 billion yen\n($54 million) so far.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F4%2F4%2F4%2F7%2F20417444-5-eng-\nGB%2FCropped-1557449501P4021656_3968x2976.jpg?source=nar-cms) Abeja President\nYosuke Okada founded the company in 2012, venturing into the uncharted\nterritory of deep learning. (Photo by Akane Okutsu)\n\nAbeja's technology can be found in more than 530 stores in Japan, including\nthose of well-known brands Guess and Beams. At the Parco_ya Ueno shopping\ncenter in central Tokyo, footage from 200 cameras is run through the company's\nAI system to track how many customers come in, their age and their gender.\n\nCompetitors provide similar services, such as U.S. player RetailNext and\nJapan's Aroba. But Kenji Nonaka, general manager at shopping mall operator\nParco, said Abeja has more experience than the others, allowing it to pool\nexpertise from across a broad spectrum customers and predict outcomes more\naccurately. Abeja \"knows what [its other clients] did to improve revenue and\noperations,\" he said.\n\nThe relationship is paying off. One Parco_ya apparel boutique was having\ntrouble selling a certain brand. Based on Abeja's advice, Parco and the\nboutique analyzed their data and moved the display close to a particular\nentrance. The result was an increase in sales.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F2%2F1%2F3%2F1%2F20681312-3-eng-\nGB%2F20190510-AI-startups-Hrz.png?source=nar-cms)\n\nParco's next step will be to track individual customers who agree to have\ntheir identities linked to their profiles on its smartphone app. This will\ngive the company a complete picture of which shops they browse, how often they\nvisit and what they buy.\n\nAbeja declined to disclose its sales figures, but it works with over 150\ncompanies. The vast majority -- around 100 -- are in the retail sector.\n\nThis was not what Okada had in mind when he started out. \"That's what is\ninteresting about technologies,\" he said. \"You don't know how you can use them\nas they emerge.\"\n\nOkada was a tech-savvy child and, by the time he was in junior high school,\nwas building his own software. Okada says he studied computer graphics at\nuniversity, although he refuses to disclose where he went. While there, he and\na friend founded a photo sharing service similar to Instagram. He left\nuniversity without getting his diploma to focus on the business, but it soon\nfailed. He then ** ** took a job with the Japanese internet services startup\ncalled RichMedia, where he learned everything from system development to\nsales, preparing for a second crack at a startup.\n\nHe was working in Silicon Valley for RichMedia when he stumbled upon the\nconcept of deep learning.\n\nPut as simply as possible, deep learning describes computer systems that use\nalgorithms to mimic the learning capabilities of the human brain. By\nperforming a task over and over, the AI achieves progressively better results.\n\nOkada set up Abeja in September 2012, just before deep learning received wide\nacademic attention. That October, a team from the University of Toronto used\nthe technology to win the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, a\nmajor computer image recognition competition.\n\nDeep learning quickly improved the accuracy of image recognition by about 10%,\nwhile earlier methods had managed only a 5% gain after decades of work. Okada\nsaid this was revolutionary, unlike many technologies that merely \"optimize\nwhat can already be done.\"\n\n\"Deep learning enabled what was not possible before.\" And back then, he said\nthere were no ventures in Japan that focused on it.\n\nSo he started one.\n\nOkada met Tomimatsu while the latter was looking to hire an engineer for a\ndigital signage company -- which later merged with Abeja. At first, Tomimatsu\nsaid he found deep learning \"scary,\" since it could identify individuals with\na high degree of precision. But he also sensed the potential for turning it\ninto a business.\n\nOne problem the company faced in its early days was that nobody knew what deep\nlearning was all about. Okada zeroed in on the retail sector because, he said,\nthe companies happened to be more receptive to working with startups. In 2015,\nAbeja won an award in a venture competition backed by major Japanese\ndepartment store operator [Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings](/Companies/Isetan-\nMitsukoshi-Holdings-Ltd).\n\nNow Okada is setting his sights beyond retail, and is partnering with\ncompanies in other industries as well as overseas. As Tomimatsu put it, while\nOkada has the skills to create something from nothing, \"to grow the business\nmodel from 10 to 100, [Abeja] will need help from a lot of people.\"\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Flarge_580%2F6%2F7%2F2%2F2%2F20432276-3-eng-\nGB%2F20190422-Abeja%27s-partner-Table.png?source=nar-cms)\n\nSome partners are also Abeja investors, and are collaborating closely to build\nnew deep-learning applications. Japanese air conditioner manufacturer [Daikin\nIndustries](/Companies/Daikin-Industries-Ltd2) and Abeja are developing a\nsystem to deduce which parts need to be repaired, based on inquiries to\nDaikin's call center. Auto parts supplier [Musashi Seimitsu\nIndustry](/Companies/Musashi-Seimitsu-Industry-Co.-Ltd) is working with the\nstartup to identify defective products in its factory.\n\nIn 2017, Abeja set up its first overseas office in Singapore. \"Japan is not a\nleading country for AI,\" Okada said, explaining why he ventured abroad as soon\nas the company had enough funds.\n\nThis past February, Abeja announced a project with Singaporean subway operator\nSMRT to find ways to enhance safety. In Thailand, the company is working with\nJapanese auto component maker [Denso](/Companies/DENSO-Corp) to analyze the\nmovements of factory workers, to maximize efficiency.\n\nAbeja is also in talks with Google on global opportunities, as the search\ncompany expands its Google Cloud Platform.\n\nUltimately, Okada aims to draw on Abeja's experiences with its partners to\nprovide software as a service, or SAAS, packages for multiple sectors. In\nother words, it would sell subscriptions to cloud-hosted applications designed\nto be suitable for an entire industry. This would complement the custom\nsystems it now designs for individual clients.\n\nCurrently, Abeja only offers an SAAS product for retailers.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F8%2F0%2F7%2F6%2F20456708-8-eng-\nGB%2FCropped-1557449806%E5%9B%B31%20%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC.jpg?source=nar-\ncms) Auto parts maker Denso uses Abeja's technology at its Thai factory to\ndetect and minimize inefficient worker movements. (Courtesy of Denso)\n\nOkada said his company has learned from struggles and failures. It keeps a\nchecklist of seemingly minor but crucial factors that can throw off its image\nrecognition system, such as backlight or posters with pictures of models in\napparel shops. Its involvement in the retail business has also provided\nvaluable expertise on handling hardware -- such as how to place cameras to\ncapture necessary data, and how to transfer and process the information in the\ncloud.\n\nContrary to popular belief that AI removes humans from the equation, companies\nfind the technology can be extremely labor-intensive. Images of objects, for\ninstance, need to be labeled by humans so that the system can learn to tell\nthem apart. Many AI companies outsource this annotation process but end up\nfeeding their AI data that is only 70% to 80% accurate. Abeja provides\ncompanies with the tools, advice and human resources for the process, and says\nit has achieved over 99% accuracy.\n\nOkada argues that Abeja is uniquely positioned to serve as \"industrial\nmachinery\" -- the tool that will allow his clients to build their own AI to\nenhance their business. For example, he believes that Abeja's cloud platform\nmakes it easier for companies to manage the vast amount of data they generate,\nto annotate it and to ensure the system learns properly. He said many other\nplayers in the field, such as Hong Kong-based SenseTime, are merely\napplication providers. \"Companies want customized AI for fields where they\nwant to differentiate from others,\" Okada has said.\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F3%2F6%2F3%2F1%2F20681363-1-eng-\nGB%2F20190510-AI-derived-business-Line.png?source=nar-cms)\n\nAnne Bioulac, senior and co-managing partner at consultancy Roland Berger's\nFrench office, said working with startups like Abeja -- versus tech giants --\noffers certain advantages for clients. This includes an ability to implement\npilot programs \"very quickly.\"\n\n\"Startups can offer a better ability to develop pilots and R&D projects\ntogether with companies,\" she said.\n\nEven so, Okada wants to scale up dramatically. But he admits this is no easy\ntask for company like his. Commercial use of artificial intelligence is still\nrelatively new and it can be difficult for companies to identify where to\ninvest in order to extract value. There is also a risk that the current\ntechnology becomes obsolete with the emergence of new ones.\n\nOkada hopes to overcome this by keeping irons in several fires. \"It is better\nas a company to focus on many technological fields,\" he said. \"It's our role\nto implement them in society.\"\n\nThe company recently set up an R&D project called Abeja X to dig into new\ntechnologies. The first target is quantum computing, which promises data\nanalysis at astonishing speeds. Calculations that would take today's computers\nbillions of years could take a quantum computer days, or even less time.\n\nBut his search for opportunities is not confined to information technology. He\nenvisions a great convergence of \"all types of engineering\", opening up a\nrange of new opportunities not yet dreamt of. His interests include genetic\nand cell engineering, which could expand human capabilities.\n\nOkada refuses to be pigeonholed. \"I never said Abeja is an AI company.\"\n\n![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-\nnortheast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-\nftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Flarge_580%2F6%2F7%2F7%2F6%2F20676776-1-eng-\nGB%2F20190509-Abeja-Timeline.png?source=nar-cms)\n\n![mobile-email-icon](/bundles/app/images/newsletter-signup.svg?76b0)Stay

While the Twitterati are busy giving\nopinions, here are some other phones that might impress Mr. Mahindra.\n\nWhy are we looking at other smartphone cameras? Well, because while both\nGoogle and Apple claim to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to produce the\nimages they do on their smartphones, so do some of their competitors who hold\na bigger share of the market in the country.\n\n**OnePlus 7 Pro**\n\nThe leader of India\u2019s premium market, OnePlus\u2019 smartphone cameras may not\nmatch up to a Google Pixel 3 or the new iPhones, but they are still quite\ngood. The company enhanced the camera software with an update recently and\nalso claims to use AI algorithms to understand scenes and enhance the final\nimage.\n\n**Honor View 20**\n\nHuawei was amongst the first to introduce AI algorithms in smartphone cameras.\nThe company extends that to its Honor brand and the Honor View 20 is one of\nthe best cameras it has on the market today.\n\n**Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro**\n\nArguable the most value for money flagship-class smartphone today, the Redmi\nK20 Pro runs on the Snapdragon 855 chipset, Qualcomm\u2019s latest and greatest.\nHowever, it also has an AI camera mode that slightly oversaturates image to\nsuit most mainstream user\u2019s tastes in photos.\n\n**Huawei Mate 20 Pro**\n\nIt\u2019s true that Huawei announced an upgrade to this phone yesterday, but that\ntakes nothing away from the company\u2019s current device. Many have said that the\nMate 20 Pro has a better camera than the Google Pixel 3, which is saying\nsomething in today\u2019s smartphone space. If you can afford this device, it\u2019s\ncertainly one for the camera lovers.\n\nOf course, we would love to know Mr Mahindra's viiews on these smart cameras\ntoo.\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Image conscious: Four smartphones that\nmay impress Mr Mahindra - https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/image-\nconscious-four-smartphones-that-may-impress-mr-mahindra-1568951525522.html\n%0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in Business News -\nhttps://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\")\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Image conscious: Four smartphones that\nmay impress Mr Mahindra - https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/image-\nconscious-four-smartphones-that-may-impress-mr-mahindra-1568951525522.html\n%0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in Business News -\nhttps://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\")\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[Anand Mahindra](/topic/anand-mahindra)[Smartphones](/topic/smartphones)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

As such, business leaders often ask me for tips on recommend\nreading \u2013 they want to know which books will help them understand the AI\nrevolution, grasp its impact on our world and plan for an AI-driven future.\n\nWhat Is The Best Book On Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nI read a lot about AI, for my consulting work, and more recently as research\nfor my latest book \u2018[Artificial Intelligence in\nPractice](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1783)\u2019 and, of\ncourse, because I find the subject absolutely fascinating. In fact, I\u2019d say\nI\u2019ve devoured pretty much every key AI book that\u2019s been published in the last\ndecade.\n\nMy plan for this article was to nominate the single best book on AI \u2013 as in,\nif you could only read one, which book should it be? But, honestly, it was\njust too difficult to narrow down my favorites to one book!\n\nInstead, I offer you my top five. In my view, these are the very best AI books\nthat are available right now. All focus on the implications of AI for business\nand society (as opposed to the nitty-gritty tech side of AI). So if you're\ninterested in the potential impact of AI, or how AI is going to transform\nevery aspect of our world, I highly recommend these five books.\n\n**_[The Fourth Age:](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Age-Conscious-Computers-\nHumanity/dp/1501158562/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=4th+age&qid=1551437939&s=gateway&sr=8-1)_**\n** _Smart Robots, Conscious Computers, and the Future of Humanity_**\n\n**By Byron Reese, published May 2018**\n\nThis fascinating book argues that AI will have enormous implications for the\nhuman race, to the extent that it will redefine what it means to be human. As\nbackground, Reese sets out the previous three ages where technology has\nreshaped humanity and sets up AI and robotics as the fourth age of\ntransformation. In other words, it\u2019s a gripping (and surprisingly optimistic)\naccount of how we got where we are today, and how we should approach the new\nage that\u2019s upon us.\n\nBest for: Understanding what AI will mean for us as a species, without getting\nsucked into a doom-and-gloom dystopian fantasy.\n\n**_[Life 3.0:](https://www.amazon.com/Max-Tegmark-\nLife-3-0-%E3%80%902018%E3%80%91/dp/B07J5BZZ1F/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=life+3.0&qid=1551437974&s=gateway&sr=8-6)_**\n** _Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence_**\n\n**By Max Tegmark, published July 2018**\n\nOne of Barack Obama's favorite books of 2018 and named Book of the Year by\nboth _The Times_ and _The Daily Telegraph_ , this highly praised book more\nthan lives up to the hype.\n\nIn it, Tegmark, who is a physicist and cosmologist, sets out to separate AI\nmyths from reality in an approachable and lively way. Impressively, he manages\nto cover some quite challenging topics and questions (How can we create a more\nprosperous world through automation? How can we protect AI systems from\nhacking and nefarious use?) without being too high-brow or dumbing down \u2013 and\nwithout telling the reader what to think.\n\nBest for: Facilitating challenging, thought-provoking conversations about AI,\nwhether you want to impress folks around the water cooler or instigate serious\nAI strategy discussions.\n\n**_[Homo Deus:](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-\nTomorrow/dp/0062464310/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=life+3.0&qid=1551437974&s=gateway&sr=8-7)_**\n** _A Brief History of Tomorrow_**\n\n**By Yuval Noah Harari, published March 2017**\n\nFollowing on from his smash hit _Sapiens,_ which explored how the human race\nevolved, Harari peeks into the not-too-distant future to see what\u2019s in store\nfor the human race. Artificial life is just one part of this envisioned world,\nand Harari explores a range of other challenges, including immortality. If you\nenjoyed Sapiens (I mean, who didn\u2019t?), this follow-up is a must-read.\n\nBest for: Combining hard science with stimulating philosophical questions\naround human identity. Definitely one to make you feel smarter!\n\n**_[AI Superpowers:](https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-\nValley/dp/132854639X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=58PAYJ0EC4PI&keywords=ai+super+powers%2C+china%2C+silicon+valley%2C+and+the+new+world+order&qid=1551438056&s=gateway&sprefix=ai+super+p%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1)_**\n** _China, Silicon Valley And The New World Order_**\n\n**By Kai-Fu Lee, published January 2019**\n\nIn one of the most recent books I\u2019ve read (at the time of writing this\narticle), Lee argues that, thanks to China\u2019s astonishing growth in this area,\nit now rivals the US in AI technology. For both of these superpowers, and\nindeed the rest of the world, this means dramatic business and societal\nchanges will hit us sooner than anyone could imagine.\n\nIf global politics really isn\u2019t your thing, don\u2019t be put off. Lee paints a\nvery readable picture of what this increasing AI competition will mean for\nreal people\u2019s jobs.\n\nBest for: Understanding which jobs (both blue collar and white collar) are\nmost likely to be affected by AI, and which jobs can be enhanced with AI.\n\n**_[Human + Machine:](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Machine-Reimagining-Work-\nAge/dp/1633693864/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=human+machine&qid=1551438110&s=gateway&sr=8-2)_**\n** _Reimagining Work in the Age of AI_**\n\n**By Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson, published March 2018**\n\nDaugherty and Wilson are Accenture\u2019s Chief Technology and Innovation Officer\nand Managing Director of IT and Business Research, giving this book a laser-\nlike focus on the business implications of AI \u2013 or, more specifically, how\ncompanies are using AI to innovate and grow.\n\nKey to this book is the idea that no business process will be left untouched\nby AI. Across all areas of business, humans and intelligent machines are\nworking more closely together and changing how companies operate. Indeed, the\nauthors set out six hybrid \u2018human + machine\u2019 roles that they believe every\nbusiness must put in place.\n\nBest for: Providing a practical blueprint for business leaders who want to\ncapitalize on the AI revolution.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed my recommended reading list and, as always, I would love\nto hear your views.

Demand planning is no longer a case of simply reacting - instead, it\nrequires continuous proactivity to successfully predict demand. In line with\nthis, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an intrinsic part of the demand\nplanning function, further boosting planning accuracy through sensing the\nmarkets\u2019 desires.\n\nA recent Capgemini [report](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/12/Report-%E2%80%93-Digital-Supply-\nChain%E2%80%99s-Missing-Link-Focus-Digital.pdf) found that, when it comes to\nsupply chain digitalization, organizations work on too many projects\nsimultaneously, with close to 30 projects at pre-deployment stages. This high\nvolume inevitably leads to some initiatives failing to take off, and places\nthe most critical projects at risk. The digitalization of demand planning -\nand subsequent implementation of AI - is one example of a critical initiative\nwhich businesses must prioritize, and that has tangible and quick benefits,\nincluding:\n\n**_Strategic decision-making_**\n\nAI drives automation of the more traditional and labour-intensive tasks within\ndemand planning to the next level \u2013 most notably, analyzing and interpreting\nbatches of data. Not only is AI able to do this more accurately and quickly,\nbut \u2013 by automating these critical but complex tasks \u2013 the team\u2019s time is\nfreed up so that they can focus on more strategic business endeavours.\n\nAdditionally, demand planners no longer need to dedicate large amounts of time\nto creating short-term demand plans or triggering stock replenishment \u2013 AI can\ndo this for them. The team can then concentrate on progressing higher-value\nbusiness objectives that will have a greater impact on the organization.\nDemand planners will need to interpret their role more strategically, e.g.\ndedicate more time to investigate how to improve operational efficiency,\nidentify new ways to increase profits and become more involved in the business\nas a whole.\n\n**_Improved forecasting_**\n\nWith so much data readily available, it has become more difficult to detect\ncustomer purchasing patterns. Artificial intelligence can work to cut through\nthis noise, processing the data to uncover subtle patterns that humans would\nhave missed. By aggregating datasets from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP),\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems \u2013\nand combining this with external variables and contextual data such as a\ncalendar of events, seasonality and the weather \u2013 AI works to provide more\naccurate demand planning forecasts.\n\nIf this holistic approach is taken, AI forecasts can then be linked through\nsupply and inventory planning to automate replenishment triggers, so that\norganizations consistently have the correct amount of products in stock. This\nresults in increased sales by improving order fill rates and shelf\navailability.\n\n**SEE ALSO:**\n\n  * [Strategic supplier relationships, sustainability and digitalisaton: five procurement trends for 2019](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/technology/strategic-supplier-relationships-sustainability-and-digitalisaton-five-procurement)\n\n  * [SAP Ariba eyes procurement digitalisation for mid-market companies](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/procurement/sap-ariba-eyes-procurement-digitalisation-mid-market-companies)\n\n  * [Companies failing to realise full benefit of supply chain digitalisation](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/technology/companies-failing-realise-full-benefit-supply-chain-digitalisation)\n\n  * [Read the latest issue of Supply Chain Digital here!](https://www.supplychaindigital.com/magazine/supply-chain-digital/may-2019)\n\nFor example, a global organization for personal care products built a demand-\ndriven supply chain using data analytics to increase visibility into real-time\ndemand trends. This enabled the company to produce and store the exact amount\nof inventory required to replace what consumers actually purchased, instead of\nmanufacturing based on forecasts from historical data. The company also\nutilized point-of-sales (POS) data from retailers such as Walmart to generate\nforecasts that triggered shipments to stores and informed internal deployment\ndecisions and tactical planning.\n\nThis approach helped the company to effectively track stock keeping units and\nshipping locations. As a result, it saw up to a 35% reduction in forecast\nerrors for a one-week planning horizon and 20% for a two-week horizon.\n\n**_More responsive_**\n\nSupply chain channels are undoubtedly vulnerable to a variety of external\nfactors \u2013 for example natural disasters or availability of raw materials\u2013 that\ncan impact demand forecasting. Rather than relying on historical data, AI and\nmachine learning tools use real-time calculations to respond to and find\nresolutions for supply chain disruptions. As well as this, automation allows\nfor rapid responses to changing consumer demand, improving sales and profits,\nand boosting consumer loyalty. This added responsivity boosts the accuracy of\ndemand planning and limits monetary losses.\n\nAn office products retailer, for example, had disparate systems working\nautonomously with different SKUs, forecasting and planning processes.\nManagement recognized that, without a \u201csynchronized view of demand\u201d of its\nsupply chain, the company could not respond rapidly enough to market changes.\nCapgemini and a software solutions provider were brought in to implement an\ninnovative solution designed to empower the retailer with synchronized\ndecision-making and, ultimately, a unique competitive advantage. The solution\nis allowing the company to proactively meet fluctuations by tightly\nintegrating a range of core business processes, starting at merchandise\nplanning through to the replenishment process. The company expects this to\nincrease top-line revenue by delivering real strategic value and strong demand\nchain results.\n\nAs with any significant organizational change, an agile approach \u2013 involving\nsmall steps, small failures, and fast recovery \u2013 can deliver the quick results\nthat clearly demonstrate the value of cutting-edge demand planning approaches,\nsuch as the implementation of AI.\n\nWith this in mind, A proof of concept approach (POC) is highly recommended.\nThis allows enterprises to gain a better understanding of the costs and\nreturns of automation, as well as understand the skills and alterations that\nwill be needed to accommodate it. Ultimately, the sooner an organization\nbegins to adjust the way it goes about demand planning, the sooner the\nbenefits will become apparent.\n\n_By_[ _J\u00f6rg

https://str.sg/JiJK Copy\n\n[Vincent Chang](/authors/vincent-chang)\n\n[vinchang@sph.com.sg](mailto:vinchang@sph.com.sg \"vinchang@sph.com.sg\")\n\nThe Redmi Note 8 Pro crams impressive hardware, such as a 64-megapixel (MP)\ncamera, into an affordable and well-made package at a quarter of the price of\na flagship smartphone.\n\nThis is not surprising as Redmi, the budget sub-brand of smartphone maker\nXiaomi, has always offered good value for money. There is even more at stake\nnow for Redmi, as it faces stiff competition from the likes of Oppo's similar-\nsounding Realme sub-brand, which launched in Singapore last week.\n\nWith a starting price of $329 for the base 64GB version, the Note 8 Pro is the\nflagship Redmi model in Singapore. Besides its 64MP camera, which is part of a\nquad-camera system, the phone has an attractive glass-backed chassis, a\ncapable mid-tier octa-core processor and a large 4,500mAh battery.\n\nPerhaps because of its 64MP camera, the Note 8 Pro has a sizeable rear camera\nbump that makes the phone seem wobbly on the desk. This 64MP camera uses the\nsame Samsung sensor as the $1,299 Vivo Nex 3 phone that I recently tested.\n\nBy default, this main camera uses pixel-binning to produce 16MP photos. Shots\ntaken in the day look sharp and detailed with mostly accurate colours. Turning\non the AI camera mode tends to make colours look a bit more vivid.\n\nUnless you wish to zoom into the details of photos, I would not recommend\ntaking 64MP photos as you will end up with large files (almost 20MB each).\nThis 64MP mode somewhat mitigates the lack of a telephoto camera lens in the\nNote 8 Pro because you can zoom in to check the details of a distant object.\n\nThe phone also has an ultra-wide camera, a macro camera and a depth camera.\nPersonally, I do not see the point of the 2MP macro camera, which is used only\nfor close-up shots and seems to be there to make up the numbers.\n\nThe ultra-wide camera is adequate but did not impress. Photos are noisy and\nslightly washed out. But it does have its uses for group selfies and landscape\nshots.\n\nI was also not excited by the camera's long-exposure night mode. Photos turned\nout just a tad brighter in this mode than normal photos.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [New products, Oct 30, 2019: Redmi Note 8 Pro, Razer Viper Ultimate and\nmore](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/new-products-204)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Xiaomi Mi 9T an excellent mid-range\nsmartphone](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/smartphones/xiaomi-mi-9t-an-\nexcellent-mid-range-smartphone)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Smartphone maker Xiaomi plans to launch more than 10 5G phones next\nyear](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/smartphones/smartphone-maker-xiaomi-\nplans-to-launch-more-than-10-5g-phones-next-year)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Tech review: Xiaomi Mi 9 boasts unbeatable value for\nmoney](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/smartphones/tech-review-xiaomi-\nmi-9-boasts-unbeatable-value-for-money)\n\nThe phone has a rear fingerprint sensor located on the camera bump. This old-\nschool sensor is fast and accurate compared to newer, in-display versions that\nare probably deemed too high-end for Redmi.\n\nThe Note 8 Pro has a \"dot drop\" display with the 20MP front selfie camera in\nthe middle just below the top bezel. The display is surrounded by thin borders\nthat appear to be drawn by a black marker pen.\n\nAt its maximum 500 nits brightness, this IPS LCD screen is bright enough to\nuse outdoors in the sun. Viewing angles are decent. While the screen has a\nfull-HD resolution, the phone actually plays Netflix videos at standard\nresolution (480p). This is because the phone lacks the appropriate level of\ndigital rights management (Widevine L1) necessary to play content at HD\nresolution. But there is no issue with 1080p playback for YouTube videos.\n\nOften omitted in cheaper phones is near-field communication (NFC), a\ntechnology which is used for mobile payments. The Note 8 Pro has this feature,\nas well as the increasingly rare ability - in phones - to control other\ndevices via an infrared blaster. Like most budget phones, the 3.5mm audio jack\nis present. You probably want to use headphones as the Redmi's bottom-firing\nspeaker is middling and not the loudest.\n\nPowering it is a MediaTek octa-core processor that is said to be optimised for\nmobile gaming. I had no problems with mobile games like PUBG Mobile running\nsmoothly at High setting. More importantly, the exterior felt only slightly\nwarm while running a game.\n\nOutside of games, the Note 8 Pro felt fast and responsive during navigation\nand opening apps. Xiaomi's MIUI 10 interface (based on Android 9) is not my\nfavourite Android skin because of the number of unnecessary, preloaded system\napps and utilities, but at least it is very customisable and does not\nslavishly copy the Apple iPhone.\n\nDespite its large 4,500mAh battery, the Note 8 Pro did not fare as well as I\nhad expected in our video-loop battery test. It lasted 9hr15min with the\nscreen at maximum brightness compared to Oppo Reno2's (over 15hr). However,\nthe Note 8 Pro lasted over a day for me when used mainly for Web browsing and\nwork e-mails.\n\n#### FOR\n\nMain 64MP camera is good in bright, well-lit conditions\n\nAffordable price for its hardware\n\nCapable processor optimised for mobile games\n\n#### AGAINST\n\nToo many preloaded apps\n\nBattery life shorter than expected for video playback\n\n#### SPECS\n\n**Price:** $329 (64GB), $369 (128GB)\n\n**Processor:** MediaTek Helio G90T (Dual-core 2.05GHz, hexa-core 2GHz)\n\n**Display:** 6.53-inch IPS LCD, 2,340 x 1,080 pixels, 395 ppi pixel density\n\n**Operating system:** MIUI 10 (Android 9)\n\n**Memory:** 64GB/128GB (microSD expandable by up to 256GB), 6GB RAM\n\n**Rear cameras:** 64MP (f/1.9), 8MP ultra-wide (f/2.2, 120-degree), 2MP macro\n(f/2.4), 2MP depth (f/2.4)\n\n**Front camera:** 20MP (f/2.0)\n\n**Battery:** 4,500mAh\n\n#### RATING\n\n**Features:** 4.5/5\n\n**Design:** 4/5\n\n**Performance:** 4/5\n\nValue for money: 4.5/5\n\nBattery life: 4/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [TECH REVIEW](/tags/tech-review)\n  * [SMARTPHONES](/tags/smartphones)\n  * [ANDROID](/tags/android)\n  * [XIAOMI](/tags/xiaomi)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=11/12/2019&title=Tech\nreview: Redmi Note 8 Pro offers good value for money)\n\nPermalink: https://str.sg/JiJK Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=11/12/2019&title=Tech\nreview: Redmi Note 8 Pro offers good value for money)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=11/12/2019&title=Tech\nreview: Redmi Note 8 Pro offers good value for money)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=tech-review-redmi-note-8-pro-offers-good-value-for-\nmoney)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

Employees can also access company resources,\nsuch as office locations, seating maps and company policies. IBM Watson AI\npowers the Hub Virtual Assistant, according to Jeff McGrath, senior director\nof product marketing at VMware.\n\nAnother new Workspace One feature focuses more on IT and the capability to\nproactively detect and remediate potential issues that could [affect end\nusers](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/feature/Get-users-on-\nboard-with-your-VMware-Workspace-One-deployment). Called Digital Employee\nExperience Management, the new capability combines Workspace One Unified\nEndpoint Management, Workspace One Intelligence and Apteligent, a mobile\napplication intelligence vendor VMware acquired.\n\n\"As someone who's an existing VMware customer, [Workspace One] can pose a\nsignificant value proposition with all the integrations we already have with\nVMware,\" said Josh Wolfe, a senior systems administrator for a financial\nservices company. \"Workspace One could potentially replace a few third-party\nsolutions we use now.\"\n\nHis organization isn't currently a Workspace One customer, but can see the\ngain the new Workspace One features could bring an IT department, Wolfe said.\nBut the transition won't be seamless for most organizations.\n\n\"The potential advantage is also the challenge [in terms of\nmigration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/news/252447606/VMware-\nWorkspace-One-updates-aim-to-ease-Windows-10-management),\" Wolfe said.\n\"Because things like onboarding, device management and security have existed\nin silos for so long, we tend to have these different contracts and process\nalready existing. Something like onboarding with Workspace One may be a more\nstaggered and lengthy rollout than just turning a switch.\"\n\nEasing the strain on IT and HR resonated with other attendees, as well.\n\nAdam Main, an enterprise architect at Legacy Reserves, an energy company in\nMidland, Texas, said the organization could benefit from new Workspace One\nfeatures that automate simple, monotonous tasks from HR and IT. That's\nparticularly the case at Legacy Reserves, because the IT and HR departments\nare integrated; the CTO is also the head of HR, Main said.\n\n\"We've made an effort to streamline things as it is, and onboarding has been a\npriority for us,\" he said. \"What we saw [at VMworld] was phenomenal.\"\n\n### __VMware homes in on security\n\nVMware also unveiled two substantial acquisitions, buying security vendor\nCarbon Black for $2.1 billion and [platform-as-a-\nservice](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Platform-as-a-\nService-PaaS) vendor Pivotal for $2.7 billion.\n\n> Prior to the Carbon Black acquisition, VMware customers had to explore\n> strategies that encompassed a built-in or bolted-on security strategy. The\n> acquisition greatly simplifies this decision.  **Mark Bowker** Senior\n> analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group  __\n\nThe acquisitions, combined with the new Workspace One features, show a\nsignificant reinvestment in digital workspace and the important role security\nplays in it, Bowker said.\n\n\"The VMware Workspace One strategy is a platform geared to deliver a secure\nand consistent experience to end users across any device,\" Bowker said. \"Prior\nto the Carbon Black acquisition, VMware customers had to explore strategies\nthat encompassed a built-in or bolted-on security strategy. The acquisition\ngreatly simplifies this decision.\"\n\nThe new Digital Employee Experience Management feature, for example, aims to\nsolve hardware, OS and application issues that could affect an end user's\ndevice and tie up IT in the process. If an end user opens an email and\ndownloads an update for some of their applications that ends up being a\nmalware attack, for instance, Workspace One will notify IT, and admins can\nlock that user's access. IT will be able to remotely diagnose and fix user\nissues across both mobile devices and PCs.\n\n\"A lot of the [features with Workspace One](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-\nWorkspace-ONE/services/WS1-IDM-\ndeploymentguide/GUID-53E6F8E0-0ACB-42C7-8BF0-CA407D78C4F8.html) around\nsecurity and analytics were great to see,\" Main said. \"The risk factors\ndashboard that IT has, combined with the emphasis on providing a consistent\nexperience, is neat.\"\n\nA more well-rounded digital workspace environment like the one VMware is\ncreating could lead to more adoption, Bowker said.\n\n\"The focus on the user and IT are valuable to show as the VMworld audience\nbegins to rotate plans to adopt a [Workspace One] strategy,\" he said.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Workspace management tools\n\n  * [\n\n##### VMware Workspace One feature speeds remote onboarding\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/gleason_michael.jpg) By: Mike\nGleason\n](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/news/252481147/VMware-\nWorkspace-One-feature-speeds-remote-onboarding)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Citrix Microapps benefits include improved security, UX\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/powers_john.jpg) By: John\nPowers ](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/feature/Citrix-\nMicroapps-benefits-include-improved-security-UX)\n\n  * [\n\n##### BlackBerry enters digital workspace market\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/gleason_michael.jpg) By: Mike\nGleason\n](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/news/252478541/BlackBerry-\nenters-digital-workspace-market)\n\n  * [\n\n##### New Ivanti CEO plans to stay close to the customer\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/gleason_michael.jpg) By: Mike\nGleason ](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/news/252477012/New-\nIvanti-CEO-plans-to-stay-close-to-the-customer)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/scardina_jesse.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Jesse-Scardina)\n\n[Jesse Scardina](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Jesse-Scardina) asks:\n\n## What Workspace One features most interest you?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [Deploying a Digital Workspace?

When it does, unless you're really lucky, the recruitment process' ugly\nface rears its head every single time. It is not so different for companies\nlooking to hire the right candidate either.  A job applicant needs to worry\nabout applying for the right jobs, getting through the initial rounds of\ninterview, getting picked from an ever-growing pool of prospective candidates\nand more. According to Glassdoor for Recruiters, a typical corporate job\nopening receives 250 resumes, out of which 4 to 6 are shortlisted and one is\nhired. When it takes roughly 6 seconds for recruiters to reject a resume, it's\npretty evident that candidates have it rough.\n\nOn the other hand, a company needs to worry about shortlisting the right\npeople, making sure they do not hire people with dubious backgrounds,\nproviding a good recruitment experience to all applicants without increasing\nthe cost. The cost per recruitment is increasing over the years, and companies\nhave to maintain a presence on social media, a particularly preferred platform\nfor millennials to look for jobs.\n\nDue to these factors, both the candidate and the recruiter today either dread\nthe recruitment process or do not benefit from it as well as they potentially\ncould. Startups in the recruitment industry are helping both companies and\ncandidates have a more comfortable and seamless recruitment experience by\nattacking various aspects of the overall problem. We spoke to some of the most\nnotable recruitment industry startups in India to understand how they're doing\nit.\n\n## **Screening through bots - impress.ai**\n\nThere's a prevalent fear that automation of any kind will eventually take away\njobs from humans. After understanding impress.ai and its offerings, it is\nevident that if anything, automation will allow humans to perform their jobs\nbetter. Based out of Singapore, Impress.ai describes itself as an 'AI powered\nrecruiting solution'. \"The current recruitment process is costly and\ninefficient\", says Vaisagh Viswanathan, CTO/Co-founder at impress.ai, \"When\nrecruiters spend up to 20% of the recruitment cycle just sifting through\ninformation, arbitrary filters creep in to help them speed up their work - for\ninstance, a particular CGPA level, a specific set of schools etc. impress.ai\naims to automate as much of the data stage as possible so that candidates have\na fair, skill-based chance at getting the job.\"\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/c7871d018299967363122957168bc70f21765a16.jpeg)\n\nThe arbitrary filters that Vaisagh speaks of are responsible for the quick\nrejection that a lot of deserving candidates face at the hands of overburdened\nrecruiters. According to Vaisagh, the impress.ai platform attacks this problem\non four fronts. The first is a chatbot that takes screening interviews. That\nchatbot takes into account the qualifications you've mentioned and screens\nyour application with questions based on the same. The second is a bot\ncreation wizard on the recruiter end takes your job requirements and creates a\ncustomised screening bot. The third is a semi-automated scoring system which\nis partially aided by AI. The screening bot learns from how actual recruiters\nrate free text answers and even learns how to answer questions from\ncandidates. This allows recruitment professionals to speed through the scoring\nstage with better data in their hands. The fourth aspect is a reporting system\nthat brings all of this data at the fingertips of the recruiter to be used\nduring an in-person interview.\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/444c42a3ddba866c83ee0ed37e67e68a2baec57d.jpeg)\n\n_This is what an interview process that integrates Impress.ai could look like_\n\n\"We've brought down the time spent by recruiters on information gathering by\n75%,\" Vaisagh says, \"Where a recruiter would have to spend 37 minutes to\nscreen a candidate earlier, it now only takes eight minutes. As a result, a\ncandidate, who would usually have to wait a week after application for any\nprogress, now gets an update in 30 minutes.\"\n\nLast year, Amazon's machine learning experts discovered that their AI\nrecruitment tool was biased against women because it was trained on biased\ndata. It penalised resumes with the words 'women's' such as Women's chess club\ncaptain etc. According to Vaisagh, such biases are actively avoided on\nimpress.ai by masking any kind of personal information for the bot during\nevaluation. It is only revealed upon the manual intervention of any kind. Even\nthe individual answers are rated distinctly, without any connection to\npersonal information. Impress.ai aims to solve the problems typically\nassociated with the initials stages of recruitment.\n\n## **On-demand interviews - Monjin**\n\nOnce your application and resume do go through, the next stage - the actual\nin-person interview. Quite often, interviewers and potential candidates have\nto go back and forth several times before an interview can be scheduled at a\ntime convenient to both. Even when that does happen, there's often no way to\ngo back to it and analyse it beyond the impression that was created during the\ninterview itself. This is the problem that Monjin is trying to solve.\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/d30b43e53d6efb71c396f42b8eb5864c8fae5f37.jpeg)\n\nMonjin is a video interview platform that offers a number of interview models\nthat helps candidates, interviewers and recruiting companies. Candidates\nsigning up on the platform can opt for a one-way interview based on their\nskills. This interview is then analysed by industry experts who sign up with\nMonjin as interviewers. According to Mr Abhijeet Kashyape, CEO & Co-founder at\nMonjin, the candidates then receive a detailed analysis of their technical\nskills, as well as other aspects of an interview such their body language and\nsoft skills.\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/fbe7b6b474013a70129d020d5460cf05e354571b.jpeg)\n\n_A sample profile page for a candidate on Monjin_\n\nIn future versions, candidates will also be able to share their interview and\nits analysis beyond the Monjin platform. Industry experts who sign up on\nMonjin as interviewers get paid for each interview they take. There are four\nways in which a recruiting company can use Monjin's services.\n\n  * Our Candidates Our Interviewers: An end to end solution where companies access Monjin's repository of completed interviews in their requirement area to shortlist candidates directly.\n  * Your Candidates Our Interviewers: Monjin serves to provide the interview experts and the platforms, and also handles scheduling. This enables companies to hire beyond their expertise area.\n  * Your Candidates Your Interviewers: Monjin only serves as the workflow and scheduling manager here. Multiple stakeholders can be involved.\n  * One way interviews: the first type mentioned earlier, candidates can record responses to pre-determined questions in their expertise area.\n\nThe overall proposition of on-demand interviews, that are not bound by\nlocation or availability of expertise is to smoothen the recruitment process.\n\n## **Blue-collar lifecycle management - Betterplace**\n\nA large portion of India's workforce is in the blue collar segment - or manual\nlabour. In recent times, the evolution of the on-demand economy and the rise\nof startups that provide such services has led to a boom in blue collar jobs.\nHowever, the corresponding infrastructure to manage these employees didn't\nevolve at the same pace until very recently. We might have companies like\nBetterplace to thank for that.\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/d49eaad25ac62f6de23cc741ac7dc940470adeae.jpeg)\n\nBetterplace acts as a lifecycle management platform for blue-collar employees.\nToday, someone employed for a white-collar role doesn't have to consider the\npossibility of a credit score, a background verification, medical insurance\nand reimbursements, other forms of insurance, loan approvals etc. However,\nthese things, taken for granted by the white collar segment, are often not\navailable for blue-collar employees. For instance, how do you generate the\ncredit score for someone who has been paid in cash their entire career? This\nis where Betterplace steps in. Right from the moment of planning job\nrequirements, Betterplace assists companies find the right people for the\nright roles. They have on ground contractors and infrastructure in multiple\ncities to find people who are seeking jobs.\n\n![](https://static.digit.in/default/81d6c142364fbb814be2f38140efe182f8bf5a3b.jpeg)\n\n_An example of how it works on Betterplace in the Private Security domain_\n\nThese people are brought onboard onto their platform after thorough background\nchecks and data verification. Correspondingly, once they are onboard, they\nexist as a single entity on their platform. How does this help? Say Raj gets a\njob at employer A, works there for 3 years and then gets a better opportunity\nat employer B. Now, when employer B seeks to know more about Raj's background,\nhe can grant the employer access to his Betterplace profile which would\ninclude, among other things, his past employment records. It would also\ninclude his insurance information, track record, any known criminal records,\nand more than 200 other data points that would help a company make an informed\ndecision. Interestingly, it also ends up helping the employee avail services\nsuch as loans, insurance due to their financial records being readily\navailable.\n\nThis scale of data collection also provides interesting opportunities for\ninsights. \"Hiring trends are one part of it,\" says Mr Pravin Agarwala, CEO,\nBetterplace, \"We also help employers identify where their employees come from,\nwhich age group do they belong to etc. We also help the individual identify\nwhere potential opportunities can emerge from.\" Betterplace also provides\nattendance management systems for employers and learning modules for employees\nto perform their respective responsibilities better. Other services like\nproviding a vehicle for delivery personnel are also available. Overall, their\nobjective is to remove the hurdles between a potential blue collar employee\nand a company looking to recruit them and keep them employed.\n\n#### Videos\n\n![ZERO1 AWARDS 2017: Best

This is analysed and compared against results from candidates\nwho have already proved to be good at the job, [according to _The\nTelegraph_](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/27/ai-facial-recognition-\nused-first-time-job-interviews-uk-find/).\n\nHirevue claims to have already carried out 100,000 interviews for companies in\nthe UK. Most of the analysis is based on language \u2013 word choice, tone, speed\nof speech and sentence length are all considered. But the software also looks\nat facial expressions \u2013 smiling, brow raising and eye widening.\n\nLoren Larsen, CTO at Hirevue, said: \"There are 350-ish features that we look\nat in language: do you use passive or active words? Do you talk about 'I' or\n'We.' What is the word choice or sentence length? In doctors, you might expect\na good one to use more technical language.\n\n\"Then we look at the tone of voice. If someone speaks really slowly, you are\nprobably not going to stay on the phone to buy something from them. If someone\nspeaks at 400 words a minute, people are not going to understand them. Empathy\nis a piece of that.\"\n\nPeople are then ranked on a 1-100 score system.\n\nThe company claims it provides a less biased system than one based on the\nvagaries of a human recruiter.\n\nBut UK privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch described the idea as \"chilling\" \u2013\nwarning that unless the original dataset was extremely diverse, it is very\nlikely to be prejudiced in some way against certain types of candidate.\n\nThe lobby group added that the inevitable simplifications of the system would\nmake it biased against unconventional candidates whose expressions, or comfort\nwith a video interview, were out of step with the pre-defined \"norm\". \u00ae\n\n[ Tips and corrections\n](mailto:corrections@theregister.co.uk?subject=%5Bcorrection%5D%20Computer%20says%20no%3A%20An%20expression-\nanalysing%20AI%20has%20been%20picking%20out%20job%20candidates%20for%20Unilever&body=re:%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/30/unilever_using_ai_and_facial_tracking_in_job_interviews/\n\"Spotted an error or have a tip?
