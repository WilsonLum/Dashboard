Only 31% recorded an increase and less\nthan 25% say their workloads have remained the same.\n\nMoreover, up to 48% of managers admit they have reduced the frequency of their\none-on-one catch ups since transitioning to remote work.\n\n### Most

[COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nIt's a surprising decline given that 61% of managers say their teams are less\nproductive when working remotely, with almost 63% believing they have to be\nphysically present in order to get the best out of their team.\n\nAlmost half of the employees surveyed said they feel equally - if not more -\nengaged and productive when working from home.\n\nDirector-level employees were most likely to be feeling 'hopeful' during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, signifying a major disconnect and potential lack of\ninformation transparency within organisations.\n\nIt's a feeling not shared by the rest of the business with one in three\nemployees admitting they feel anxious.\n\nA mixture of remote and in-office work may be the way of the future with 54%\nof respondents saying they want to continue working remotely in some capacity.\n\nMoreover, 40% prefer an office atmosphere and say COVID-19 has made them\nrealise they don't enjoy working remotely.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Inside Atlassian's remote work

the combined product and service offerings can simplify efforts by school\ndistricts to keep pace with the changing security landscape with a fully\nintegrated identity and access management (IAM)

Job\ngrowth is feeling the pain too, with a growing number of American companies\nclamping down on their hiring, budgets, and growth plans overall. [Moody's\nAnalytics estimates](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/economy/job-losses-\ncoronavirus/index.html) nearly 80 million jobs in the U.S. economy are at high\nor moderate risk right now.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nNot every company can afford to completely halt their hiring plans, as certain\nroles may be essential to sustaining and growing the business amidst these\nuncertain times. And for some industries, hiring is absolutely essential right\nnow. Amazon, for example, [plans to hire an additional\n100,000](https://www.fastcompany.com/90478317/how-do-you-practice-social-\ndistancing-in-an-amazon-warehouse) warehouse and delivery workers to keep up\nwith the surge in online orders amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nFor Amazon and others, [virtual\nrecruiting](https://www.doodle.com/en/solutions/recruiting/) will be a new way\nforward.\n\nOnboarding is different because it's the first official impression of a\ncompany and typically conducted over a series of face-to-face meetings. This\ncan include one-to-one meetings with HR, direct managers, and members of the\nleadership team, as well as group meetings with various teams in the\norganization. This begs the question: Is HR prepared to pivot and adopt\nvirtual onboarding for globally distributed and remote teams?\n\nIf you're continuing with hiring plans right now and will be heavily reliant\non technology for the onboarding process, here are some key steps to take to\ndevelop and implement a successful virtual onboarding process.\n\n## Streamline the number of activities\n\n[According to Sapling](https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-\nstatistics-you-must-know-in-2020), the average new hire has 54 activities to\ncomplete during their onboarding experience. The sheer number of activities\ncould slow down an employee's ramp-up period, which could make it tough for\nthem to learn necessary skills and tasks related to their jobs. Remember, if\nan onboarding program hampers the employee's ability to perform their job, it\nwill likely cause stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. That's a surefire recipe\nfor early turnover.\n\nWhile information sharing and engagement are certainly important, it's\nimportant to balance it against the employee's personal motivations, learning\nbehaviors, and professional development goals. Be realistic and streamline the\nnumber of activities so that the onboarding process puts them on the path to\nlong-term satisfaction and engagement. Use online tools, including scheduling\nsoftware, internal communications platforms, and videoconferencing tools to\nmake sure the important onboarding meetings happen virtually. But more\nimportantly, keep the meetings as focused, engaged, and productive as\npossible.\n\nadvertisement\n\n## Educate managers on the importance of one-to-one time with direct reports\n\nStudies have found that up to 20% of all [new hires actually\nresign](https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/07/19/how-not-to-lose-your-\nnew-employees-in-their-first-45-days/#1fd76a163be3) within the first 45 days\nof their role. And when the onboarding process is conducted virtually, it's\neven more critical to get the experience right.\n\nOne way to do this is to educate managers on the importance of carving out\ntime for [one-to-one\nmeetings](https://doodle.com/content/doodle-1on1-meetings) with their direct\nreports. It could make a huge difference in the success of onboarding\nprograms. In fact, 72% of employees [surveyed by\nEnboarder](https://enboarder.com/2018/11/01/employee-onboarding-new-hire-\nretention-turnover-rates/) said one-on-one time with their direct manager is\nthe most important aspect of any pre-boarding or onboarding process.\n\nUnfortunately, this often gets overlooked because HR assumes that\nmanagers/leaders already know this. But leadership is an iterative process. HR\nneeds to involve and educate team managers and the broader leadership team\ninto the essential components of successful onboarding. Education and\nknowledge sharing needs to flow openly and effectively between both sides.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that these one-to-one meetings now have to occur\nvirtually. [Eighty percent of business\nprofessionals](https://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/rich-tehrani/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/2019-Impact-of-Video-Conferencing-Report-\nLifesize_FINAL.pdf) already rely on video for one-to-one meetings. Plus, 78%\nrely on video for team meetings/standups. The key is to use the right\ntechnology solutions to automate and optimize the process so one-to-one\nmeetings can be set up quickly, the right people can participate, the right\nknowledge is shared, and necessary action items come out as a result.\n\n## Lean into digital tools to forge shared communities (and engagement)\n\nWhen employees are physically distanced from their team members, direct\nmanagers, colleagues, and leadership, it can be easy to isolate and disengage\nwith others. This is especially true for newly hired employees who haven't had\nthe chance to experience the company's culture.\n\nBut this is where digital tools and social networks carry tremendous power in\ntheir abilities to bring communities of globally dispersed and remote\nemployees together.\n\nadvertisement\n\nI'm seeing it firsthand in our own company right now. We've created multiple\nnew channels in our dedicated internal communications platform (Slack) to\nengage our globally dispersed workforce. The purpose of these channels has\nvery little to do with providing corporate-approved messages. But yes, we're\nalso being responsible for our corporate communications.\n\nWhat's equally important is that our employees can break through the confines\nof isolation to forge a shared community that's all about embracing their true\nselves and helping each other out (regardless of teams, roles, and seniority\nlevels). Currently, team members are engaged in a fun competition to guess who\nmatches the baby photos being posted by an employee (the designated collector\nof baby photos). I've also personally invited every single employee in our\ncompany for a 15-minute virtual coffee meeting with me (twice daily to cover\nall time zones) over the next few weeks.\n\nThese examples are further proof that companies should lean into the socially\ncollaborative nature of digital tools at a time when employee engagement and\nretention could dip significantly. Digital can be vital to the success of\nonboarding programs for fully remote workers.\n\n* * *\n\n _Renato Profico is the CEO

The investment sees Enboarder added to the venture capital\u2019s impressive\n> list of portfolio companies, which includes Venmo, Acorns, Axios, Bird,\n> BetterCloud, the Huffington Post and Thrive Global.\n\nAlso participating in the round was Australian-based, Our Innovation Fund\n(OIF), a $50 million investment fund backed by some of Asia Pacific\u2019s leading\nentrepreneurs and executives. The funding round was undertaken to accelerate\ngrowth in the U.S., as well as fuel the ongoing development of the platform.\n\nEnboarder is the world\u2019s first and only Engagement Onboarding Platform, built\nto help organizations create engaging onboarding experiences. With employee\nfocused onboarding experiences proven to increase retention and productivity,\ncompanies such as McDonald\u2019s, Deloitte, GE, TomTom and Samsung [among many\nothers](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fenboarder.com%2Fenboarder-\ncustomers%2F&esheet=51902010&newsitemid=20181119005537&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=among+many+others&index=1&md5=046f1f567303d1c64556e18c95f4fdd6) are\nusing Enboarder to ensure a rich and consistent onboarding experience for new\nhires.\n\nBrent Pearson, Founder and CEO of Enboarder, said: \u201cOrganisations are waking\nup to the importance of employee experience and realising that first\nimpressions are crucial. Whilst traditional onboarding focuses on the more\nprocedural, administrative and risk mitigation tasks, today\u2019s talent shortage,\nlow unemployment rates and changing workforce demographics demands a more\nemployee focused approach, and Enboarder is leading the way. Onboarding is\ncurrently a missed opportunity to accelerate productivity, increase loyalty\nand develop an employer brand. We\u2019re making it easy to not only manage the\nentire onboarding experience at scale but really wow new hires from the day\nthey sign their offer letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited about the next phase of Enboarder\u2019s business\ngrowth. Partnering with Greycroft provides us with the capital we need to\ncontinue to grow and expand as well as provide the access to their people and\nnetwork who have incredible experience in the enterprise technology space,\u201d\nPearson continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve been incredibly well supported by our\nexisting investors and Greycroft\u2019s inclusion around the table strengthens our\ndepth of talent globally - helping guide the strategic direction of the\ncompany, open doors and take this platform to the next level.\u201d\n\nEnboarder enables customers to create customized workflows for each new hire\nrole. The process continues after the new hire is onboarded, so on their start\ndate, they are prepared and more engaged, which is shown to materially\nincrease employee retention and productivity.\n\n\u201cNew hires have typically felt a disconnect from the time they sign their\nletter of offer to their first day on the job. Many express feeling\nunderprepared for that first day in terms of what\u2019s required for the specific\nrole, their connection to that organisation\u2019s culture, the connections to\ntheir colleagues and down to the practical stuff like a working computer.\nWe\u2019re changing that for millions of employees around the world and helping\nthem hit the ground running on day one. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about the\nnext phase of Enboarder\u2019s business growth.\u201d\n\nWill Szczerbiak, a Principal at Greycroft, said: \u201cBrent\u2019s an exceptional\nfounder and CEO and the business he and the team have built is best of breed\nin a fast growing market. Enboarder is making a real impact at organisations\naround the world and we\u2019re looking forward to helping grow Enboarder\u2019s\npresence in the U.S. and seize the large opportunity ahead of it.\u201d\n\n**About Greycroft**\n\nGreycroft is a leading venture capital firm focused on investments in the\nInternet and mobile markets.

Ltd., the new joint venture of the furniture\nmanufacturer Eidai Co., Ltd. and Japan Novopan Industrial Company Ltd.,\nSiempelkamp announced. The order for a new production plant ranges from wood\npreparation to final production including the overall planning of the plant.\n\n  \n\nJapan Novopan Industrial Company Ltd has been the quality leader among\nJapanese engineered wood manufacturers for decades and has positioned itself\nin the local market. Most recently, the company entered into a joint venture\nwith Eidai Co., Ltd. and established the new company ENboard. Together, the\ntwo companies are thus regarded as joint market leaders in the Japanese\nengineered wood industry. Japan Novopan can look back on a long business\nrelationship with Siempelkamp. About 10 years ago, the company bought a plant\nin Krefeld.\n\n  \n\nThe order includes not only the overall plant planning, but also all core\nmachines for wood processing technology, energy generation and drying as well\nas classification and gluing systems. Siempelkamp also supplies the forming\nand press lines as well as the board handling systems. The heart of the new\nplant is a 7 ft x 47.1 m ContiRoll\u00ae Generation 9 press including a so-called\nPMDI package (PMDI=polymers of diphenylmethane diisocyanates).\n\n  \n\nThe plant is to be operated mainly with recycled wood and will mainly serve\nthe local market with formaldehyde-free bonded, particularly heavy chipboard.\nJapan Novopan uses the proven ContiRoll\u00ae technology with adapted pressure\ncurve as well as the indirect drying technology from B\u00fcttner. The new plant\nwill be built in a prominent position in the Shizuoka prefecture at the foot\nof Fuji Mountain, Japan's World Heritage Site and landmark.\n\n  \n\n _Photo, from left to right: Yohei

Managers wrongly assume people who accept a job are \u2018lucky\u2019,\nyet we see situations where new employees don\u2019t show up to work on the first\nday or quit after a few days for another job because they are poorly treated\nduring this critical time period,\u201d says Brian Kropp, group vice president of\nresearch at Gartner\u2019s human resources practice.\n\n> When new employees feel accepted and like they belong within an\n> organisation, better individual and organisational outcomes follow\n\n[A recent survey](https://cezannehr.com/news/survey-reveals-uk-organisations-\nsuffer-from-non-starter-syndrome/) by Cezanne HR of 250 senior human resources\npractitioners across the UK found nearly two-thirds have had new recruits quit\nbefore they even start.\n\nBut what should business leaders do to create that all-important positive\nfirst impression?\n\nFor starters, they need to think beyond the interview and job-offer stages,\nand [look at their overall employer brand,](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-\nmanagement/insurance-talent-crisis) says Beverley Nicholas, UK talent director\nat recruitment company PageGroup.\n\n[\u201cEngagement starts when somebody sees a job\nad](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/hire-vs-inspire) and considers applying for\nit, therefore it\u2019s important for a company to consider how it positions itself\nexternally when trying to attract new talent. What is your employer brand? Are\nyou giving candidates enough exposure to your business vision and values in an\nauthentic way? Then it\u2019s about being consistent from then on, with an\nonboarding programme that reinforces your message,\u201d she says.\n\n####  **Tech can give managers more time for human side of onboarding**\n\n[One of the biggest barriers to early engagement\n](https://www.raconteur.net/infographics/7-reasons-why-businesses-need-to-\nprioritise-employee-engagement)is that line managers feel they are simply too\nbusy. To combat this problem, many human resources departments are turning to\ntechnology to automate some of the process.\n\nGoogle, for example, uses an electronic checklist to remind managers to\ndiscuss things such as roles and responsibilities with new hires. Similarly,\nemployee engagement tech firm, Reward Gateway, has a 48-hour promise of\ncommunication to all job applicants that it fulfils with the help of prompts\nfrom its smart hub technology.\n\nFurthermore, candidates and new hires get access to the platform for pre-\ninterview resources, videos and other materials to help them engage with the\ncompany brand. They also get access to another portal, called Smart Spending,\nwhere they can take advantage of discounts and cashback.\n\n\u201cBy the interview and first working day, we want new employees to have a high\nlevel of brand knowledge and to be excited because they recognise the people\nthey meet and the things they encounter; that is really, really important,\u201d\nsays Gemma Matthews, head of talent acquisition at Reward Gateway.\n\nOnline platforms can also be [used to do much of the administration \u201cheavy\nlifting\u201d](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/ai-hr-human) before a new starter\u2019s\nfirst day to save managers and the human resources department\u2019s time, says\nJames Allen, group operations director at Airswift, a workforce solutions\nprovider to the energy and infrastructure industries.\n\n\u201cTechnology can help issue policies, procedures, guidelines and other\ninformation before recruits start so they are familiar with the company before\nthey join, which can help breakdown nervousness about starting a new job, as\nwell as taking care of all the admin,\u201d he says.\n\n####  **New starters must be welcomed into work environment socially**\n\n[![](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p18_2-e1559664739403.jpg)](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p18_2-e1559664739403.jpg)It\u2019s equally important,\naccording to Talya Bauer, Cameron professor of management at Portland State\nUniversity, Oregon, to integrate new employees to the social side of work\nright away, because onboarding \u201cis much more than just about orientation\u201d.\n\nA meta-analysis conducted by Professor Bauer and a colleague examined 70\nseparate studies and determined that [feeling socially accepted was a key\nfactor in newcomer success.](https://www.raconteur.net/business-\ninnovation/company-culture-need-vitamin-aspirin)\n\n\u201cWhen new employees feel accepted and like they belong within an organisation,\nbetter individual and organisational outcomes follow; investing in this\nrelationship early on sends a positive signal that the company cares about its\nemployees,\u201d she says.\n\nIn fact, the complete onboarding process shouldn\u2019t stop when the paperwork is\ncomplete, but should take anything up to a year, depending on the complexity\nof the role and business, says Ms Nicholas. But the first month is critical.\n\n\u201cDuring this time,[ successful businesses will buddy people\nup](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/work-friendships-secret-\nproductivity), run breakfast sessions between CEOs and new starters and\ngenerally be fairly creative about the whole onboarding process,\u201d she says.\n\nCompanies such as Google and Zappos, an online shoes retailer based in\nAmerica, offer induction courses over several weeks.\n\n####  **Culture and engagement particularly at risk with relocation**\n\nA focus on employee engagement during onboarding is [doubly important when new\nhires are relocating for a job; ](https://www.raconteur.net/finance/talent-\nmanagement-offshore-finance)companies should consider both the financial and\nemotional impact of such a move.\n\n\u201cForty per cent of all international assignments still fail, yet research has\nshown providing adequate support throughout the relocation and onboarding\nprocess is the key to better adjustment in the new environment,\u201d says Dr\nWashika Haak-Saheem, associate professor in human resource management at\nHenley Business School.\n\nAs a minimum, companies should[ consider assigning a local sponsor to support\nthe relocation](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/employers-help-\nhousing) and human resources managers should stay in frequent contact with\nemployees to act quickly if any intervention is needed. They should also\nconsider the needs of the immediate family, as maladjustment of family members\nis one of the major reasons for assignment failure, she adds.\n\nFor business leaders and human resources departments, installing processes and\ninvesting in technology to foster positive engagement between the company and\nnew recruits can be overwhelming, but whatever firms do, they should aim\nalways to reflect the mission and culture of their company.\n\n\u201cStart with the basic foundations and build from there,\u201d says Ms Nicholas.\nThis might be as simple as listing employee benefits, such as flexible working\non job adverts. And the best place to seek further direction? Direct from\nemployee feedback. \u201cEngage with new starters and find out about their\nexperience,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere may be some really quick-and-easy wins you can\nimplement right away.\u201d\n\n# Five top tools for onboarding and employee experience\n\n **1 Onboarding platforms**\n\nShifting the onboarding process to an online platform can save human resources\ndepartments and line mangers time and effort.\n\nReward Gateway has partnered with online onboarding platform Enboarder to\ncreate on-brand messaging, distribute learning materials and necessary\ninformation for job candidates before interviews and for new employees on\ntheir first day.\n\nThe platform, which is used by McDonald\u2019s and ING, creates customised welcome\nnotes for new hires, provides prompts to managers and will monitor their\nengagement, as well as provide a tool for employee feedback.\n\n **2** **Employer surveys**\n\nFostering a culture of open communication and shared feedback between new\nstarters, human resources departments and business leaders is a great way to\nensure an employee\u2019s needs are met, and company processes and procedures are\nworking as intended.\n\nOnline staff survey platform Glint is a convenient tool to start conversations\nbetween managers and staff. At LinkedIn, all new employees are sent a Glint\nsurvey on day five, day forty-five and day ninety, and prompted to share\nfeedback about their onboarding experience which is then passed to managers.\nLinkedIn liked Glint so much it acquired the company in 2008.\n\nThe survey tool, which is also used by Ericsson and Roche, helps \u201copen the\ndoors of communication\u201d, according to LinkedIn\u2019s senior vice president and\nchief people officer Christina Hall, making it easy for employers to gather\ninformation, make a word cloud of key words employees use in their comments\nand take any appropriate action.\n\n **3** **Interactive videos**\n\nSome companies are using virtual reality (VR) and similar technology to create\nimmersive and interactive videos that convey company culture and provide a\nunique insight into their operations.\n\nToyota Motor Europe offers video tours, created by digital learning company\nSponge, of the entire customer journey to induct new hires into the company\nethos, aims and goals.\n\nSimilarly, DHL uses VR training platform Immerse to challenge new recruits and\nexisting employees to compete against each other to stack virtual packages\nagainst the clock while following standard operating procedures. The task has\ncreated friendly competition between new and old employees, and training for\nnew hires.\n\n **4** **Employer brand**\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like public online feedback to motivate good recruitment and\nonboarding performance. Website Glassdoor, much like TripAdvisor, allows job\nsearchers to write and read reviews of more than 600,000 companies, including\nPwC, KPMG and Tesco, to discover what the firms are really like from people\nwho've actually worked there.\n\nNot only can the platform be used as a way to create a great independent\ninsight into company culture and ethos, but it can encourage staff to engage\nwith the feedback. For example, the leadership team at Reward Gateway has an\nin-house commitment to reply to every review left on the platform.\n\n **5** **Collaboration tools and apps**\n\nInviting future employees on to online social tools, such as apps and\nmessengers, can be a great catalyst for interactions between new and soon-to-\nbe colleagues. Branded communications company Speakap found 19 per cent of the\n1,000 global respondents it surveyed said being invited to join an employee\nmessenger app to chat with colleagues before the first day of work made them\nfeel connected to the company.\n\nSpeakap, which is used by Bosch and IKEA, provides mobile or desktop apps to\nco-ordinate company communications, as well as provide a place for news\nupdates, employee profiles, document management and event-sharing.\n\nAnother enduringly popular work communications app is Slack, which now has\nmore than ten million daily active users globally.\n\nAlso found in [Disengagement](https://www.raconteur.net/tag/disengagement)\n[attracting

It's not clear when they contracted\nthe virus, but both of them were at Exabeam's booth in the Moscone Center last\nmonth. Symptoms appeared after their return from the conference. If you were\nat RSAC, Exabeam urges that you take whatever steps you find prudent to ensure\nyou're not affected.\n\nFor its part, RSAC [says](https://www.rsaconference.com/novel-coronavirus-\nupdate) they've been monitoring the outbreak, but haven't yet found any clear\nlink to the conference. Nonetheless, the conference organizers urge anyone who\nattended to refer to [CDC\nrecommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-\ntreatment.html) concerning testing, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19.

One of those affected is\nhospitalized in guarded condition, CRN\n[reports](https://www.crn.com/news/security/two-exabeam-employees-at-rsa-\nconference-now-have-coronavirus). Spare a thought or a prayer for two of our\ncolleagues and their families, and stay safe.\n\nSummary\n\nBy the CyberWire staff\n\nThe US Cyberspace Solarium released its\n[report](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/CSC%20Final%20Report.pdf)\ntoday, which includes as foreseen seventy-five recommendations grouped under\nsix [heads](https://www.solarium.gov/):\n\n  1. \"Reform the U.S. Government's Structure and Organization for Cyberspace.\"\n  2. \"Strengthen Norms and Non-Military Tools.\" \n  3. \"Promote National Resilience.\" \n  4. \"Reshape the Cyber Ecosystem.\" \n  5. \"Operationalize Cybersecurity Collaboration with the Private Sector.\" \n  6. \"Preserve and Employ the Military Instrument of National Power.\"\n\nThe recommendations are framed against the background of national\nvulnerability to a sudden, disabling cyber campaign. That possibility is\nestablished imaginatively within the report by an introductory piece of\nfiction, \"A Warning from Tomorrow,\" in which legislative staffers working from\na Rosslyn, Virginia, high-rise survey the cyber-induced devastation across the\nPotomac with a sense of despair, futility, perhaps anomie.\n\nLike the report of the original Cold War Solarium (which considered nuclear\nstrategy) the recommendations concentrate heavily on deterrence and\nresilience. The commissioners offer some \"big ideas to get the conversation\nstarted.\" These include the conviction that deterrence in cyberspace is\npossible, that such deterrence relies on a resilient economy and will require\n\"government reform,\" that the private sector must up its own security game,\nand that election security must be given high priority.\n\nTake the coronavirus seriously, but stay alert to COVID-19-themed scams.\n[KnowBe4](https://blog.knowbe4.com/exploiting-the-coronavirus-the-spammers-\nthe-scammers-and-the-bad-guys),\n[RiskIQ](https://apnews.com/Globe%20Newswire/b47019e2c625c6a5f66db753754b0c66)\nand [others](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/03/11/coronavirus-\nransomware-attacks/) share warnings about this trend.\n\nYesterday was Patch Tuesday, and Microsoft\n[addressed](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-\nguidance/releasenotedetail/2020-Mar) a total of one-hundred-fifteen\nvulnerabilities, twenty-six of which are rated critical, eighty-eight are\nconsidered important, and one is held to be moderately severe. Adobe did not\nissue its usual round of patches, Help Net Security\n[reports](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/03/10/march-2020-patch-\ntuesday/).\n\n[Sponsored by KnowBe4](https://info.knowbe4.com/email-exposure-check-cw)\n\n[Have Your Users Made You an Easy Target for Spear\nPhishing?](https://info.knowbe4.com/email-exposure-check-cw)\n\nNotes.\n\nToday's issue includes events affecting Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand,\nRussia, United Kingdom, United States\n\n### Bring your own context.\n\nWhat's the business case for privacy? Does anyone have a good read on this?\n\n\" _Yes, we were very excited to be able to finally put a number on the overall\nreturn on privacy. We have looked for a couple of years at some of the areas\nof benefit, like having shorter sales delays associated with privacy\ninvestment, which means you can answer customers' questions more quickly and\nbe able to streamline your sales process. We found some security benefits,\nthat those organizations that had invested in privacy were seeing fewer and\nless costly breaches when they evaluate it over time, and we can correlate\nthat data.  _\n\n\" _And what we've done this year is to take not only those results and be able\nto validate them but also to put an overall umbrella on the value of these\nprivacy investments. And the net takeaway is that for the average\norganization, spending $100 translates into $270 of business benefit, and that\nis a very good investment for most organizations to make to get that kind of\nreturn. And again, we're encouraging people to think hard about not just doing\nthe minimum required but doing those kinds of investments which build a kind\nof trust with customers which, again, return those business values to you._ \"\n\n ** _\u2014Robert Waitman, Cisco's director of data privacy, on the CyberWire Daily\nPodcast,_**[ ** _3_**](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/daily-\npodcast/1034/transcript)[ **\n_.9.20._**](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/daily-podcast/1040/transcript)\n\nSo, not a bad return-on-investment at all.\n\n### CyberWire Pro is here.\n\nOur new subscription program, [CyberWire Pro](https://thecyberwire.com/pro),\nlaunched last week.

million fund in\nMarch of 2017.\n\n\u201cNext Coast Ventures\u2019 progress is a direct result of the hard work and\ndedication of the founders in our portfolio,\u201d Michael Smerklo, co-founder and\nmanaging director of Next Coast Ventures, said in a news release.\n\nNext Coast Ventures focuses on funding early-stage ventures, primarily in\nAustin and Texas. The firm has nearly doubled the size of its team and its\nEntrepreneurs Council in the past six months.\n\nRecently, Next Coast Ventures added Zaz Floreani to its deal team as a\nprincipal, Jonathan Kaplan as chief operating officer and Sarah Puil as\nentrepreneur-in-residence. It also added HomeAway Co-founder Brian Sharples,\nRetailMeNot Founder Cotter Cunningham and SaaS entrepreneur Julian Castelli to\nits growing Entrepreneurs Council to mentor and advise its portfolio\nleadership.\n\nNext Coast Ventures announced its first investment out of NCV II in July,\nleading the $12.5 million Series C round in Austin-based software review\nplatform, TrustRadius.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate that our LPs have continued to invest in Next Coast\nVentures, we\u2019ve had big goals from the beginning and while we\u2019ve already seen\nsome indicators of success, we plan on continuing to keep our heads down, work\nhard and do everything we can to serve great entrepreneurs in Austin and other\nNext Coast markets,\u201d Thomas Ball, co-founder and managing director of Next\nCoast Ventures, said in a news release. \u201cWe have seen incredible growth in\nthese rising innovation hubs since we founded our firm in 2015 and know that\ncities like Austin will continue to be a prime example of what is possible\noutside the coasts.\u201d\n\nNext Coast Ventures\u2019 first fund invested in over 30 portfolio companies\nlocated in Next Coast markets, including Texas, Montana, Utah, and Minnesota.\n\nNext Coast Ventures' portfolio includes Austin-based Phlur, EverlyWell,\nTenfold, 101Commerce, AlertMedia, TrustRadius, and

US investors are keen on\nAustralian startups and scaleups, but they don't always like holding shares in\nAustralian domiciled companies over the long-term.\n\nThere are **two key reasons** for this: firstly, they want senior management\nsituated close to them to more efficiently coach and network them in the US to\ndrive growth, and, secondly, Australian corporate law and regulation is not\nfamiliar to them and -- in their eyes -- adds to regulatory risk and\ntransaction costs. Whilst this process can seem complicated, it is becoming a\nwell-worn path provided you have experienced advisers to help navigate you\nthrough to completion.\n\nIncreasingly, we are seeing significant US investments tied to the condition\nof bringing the holding company or 'holdco' closer to the US investors. The\njurisdiction of choice is Delaware\u2026\n\n**Why Delaware?**\n\nThe State of Delaware has the most comprehensive and flexible set of\nfacilitating corporate law for venture capital. More than 50% of publicly-\ntraded companies are incorporated in Delaware. You don't have to have your\nprincipal place of business there, meaning you can set up anywhere in the US.\n\nWe recently helped [enboarder](https://enboarder.com/?nab=2), a fast-growing\nHuman Resources 'Software as a service' platform business, to redomicile\n(colloquially known as a 'flip') to Delaware. Below we share some insights for\nother investee companies who may be considering a similar path.\\\n\n**What is a flip?**\n\nWhether you call it a 'flip' (US) or a 'top-hat' (UK), in essence it involves\nincorporating a new entity in the foreign jurisdiction, moving all your\nAustralian shareholders and optionholders (\"stakeholders\") to that new holdco,\nthen leaving the Australian entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of the new\nholdco. This process is primarily underpinned by tax advice and structuring to\nensure that you can 'roll' the exiting holdings into the new holdco without\ntriggering a taxable event, executed by a carefully constructed legal\ndocumentation framework.\n\nMoving your shareholders to the US involves a share-for-share exchange between\nthe existing Australian entity and the new US holdco that is authorised by\nyour shareholders. Moving your optionholders requires an offer being made by\nthe new US holdco for new options on the same terms as their old options, and\nthen the cancellation of their old options. The US investor will either invest\njust prior to the flip (i.e. subscribe for shares in the Australian company\nbut with a condition that the flip happens) or invest immediately following\nthe flip. Their investment commitment obviously needs to be watertight ahead\nof time as you don't want to bother with the flip if the money will not\nfollow.\n\nThis process is a corporate flip and it looks like this:\n\n![](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/static/16c53ef1-0530-4a3a-abe0-a6fa163858e1.PNG)\n\n**Other ways to flip**\n\nAnother option is a _resource flip,_ which may satisfy a major investor\nwithout needing to complete a full (and costly) corporate flip. This is where\nkey senior management are required to spend much of the year working in the US\nso that the US investor can have more direct access and influence), working\nmore closely with them to accelerate the business such as making introductions\nand encouraging networking in the US.\n\nYou could also make a _full flip_ , which starts with the corporate flip but\nalso requires the transfer of all of the assets and the operating business to\nthe holdco or a new subsidiary in the foreign jurisdiction. This would reflect\na full pivot to the foreign jurisdiction where justified on a market basis or\nfor tax reasons.\n\n**Our top tips**\n\n\n\n**1\\. Offset the cost with a tangible upside**\n\nHaving both legal and tax advice, in both jurisdictions, is essential to get\nthis done. Consequently, it is better justified in the scale-up or late start-\nup phase of a company. To justify the cost of this, you need to see and\nextract the value-add that the investor will deliver to your business and\nmarket growth by being in the new country, whether by access to their market\nnetwork, customer distribution lines, or in-house development team.\n\n**2\\. Get advisers with experience**\n\nThis is a legally complex transaction but has been well-road tested, so\nexperienced legal advisers can efficiently manage the flip within 4-6 weeks.\nLawyers are needed in both jurisdictions, and a tax adviser with offices in\nboth countries would be preferable. If some of your shareholders or\noptionholders reside in other jurisdictions, you may also want to consider\ngetting tax advice to help them to determine the tax impact of the flip on\ntheir own position (otherwise they will need to get their own advice).\n\nOne of the advisers or someone in your own team needs to take the lead to set\nthe timetable and coordinate all the inputs, of which there are many including\nensuring compliance with Australian offer laws, incorporation of the new\nholdco and new shareholder agreements, the flip documents themselves, a new\noption plan and stock option agreements for your optionholders, the\nappointment of new board members, and a myriad of formal transfer paperwork\nthat needs to be executed to finalise the flip.\n\nGiven how much there is to do, you need a team around you that are easy to\nwork with and responsive to your timeframe.\n\n**3\\. Get your tax advice early**\n\nThe tax implications are complex, and this complexity rises if you have\nforeign shareholders on your share register and employee options outstanding.\nYou need a tax adviser who has experience in flipping companies to eliminate\nthe risk of triggering an Australian tax event for your Stakeholders, and to\nmake the process easier for you to navigate and explain to your shareholders\nand employees.\n\n**4\\. Your major shareholders need to be on board early**\n\nBefore you commit the time and adviser costs to executing the flip, you should\ncanvas your major shareholders to ensure that they are on board. The flip can\nonly happen if every shareholder agrees to exchange their shares for shares in\nthe new holdco. You may have the contractual right in your shareholder\nagreement to forcibly drag all your shareholders into the flip, but winning\ntheir approval is always a better way to go. Those shareholders will, after\nall, continue to be your shareholders after the flip.\n\n**5\\. A large shareholder body can be tricky**\n\nApart from the practical difficulties in trying to get a large shareholder\nbody to each agree to exchange their Ausco shares for shares in the new US\nholdco, there are also restrictions on making offers to your Ausco\nshareholders without a disclosure document (like a prospectus) unless all your\noffers qualify for an exclusion under law. The lesson here -- if you are going\nto make a flip, go before your capital table becomes too complicated.\n\n**6\\. Shareholder agreement mis-match**\n\nAustralian-style shareholder agreements (even one already amended to\naccommodate usual Venture Capitalist-required terms) are very different from\nthe US-style, standard investor and governance agreements. For Australian\ndomiciled shareholders, the flip only works to avoid Capital Gains Tax if they\nretain the 'same rights' after the flip as they did before -- this can't be\nachieved if you simply move from an Australian shareholder agreement to a VC-\nstandard shareholder agreement. There are a few ways to accomplish this, but\nwe suggest that you tackle this early in your planning with advisers.\n\n**7\\. Dealing with employers options**\n\nSimilar CGT rollover relief issues arise when trying to rollover your employee\noptionholders into options to be granted by the new US holdco. Standard US\nstock option plans contain concepts and restrictions that won't result in the\n'same rights' for optionholders. You also need to ensure that the favourable\nstart-up tax concessions for optionholders are maintained so that your\nemployees are no worse off from a tax perspective after the flip -- this is\nobviously important to secure their buy-in.\n\n**8\\. Communication is key**\n\nYour employees will be concerned about the flip and may have many questions\nabout how it will impact them. While a formal communications document will\nneed to accompany the final package of legal documents you send to all\nStakeholders, you don't want to 'flip out' your employees by keeping them in\nthe dark about what is going on. The story is a really positive one. A flip is\nusually a sign that the company is growing and the move to the US is\ntransformational in terms of customers, markets, and scale -- all very\nexciting stuff!\n\n[Lander & Rogers](/contributors/22447/) \\- [Deanna\nConstable](/22447/author/Deanna_Constable/)\n\n__ Back __ Forward\n\n  * [ __ Save & file  ](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d0d6d17cd-bede-4769-9e34-01297cbc945a)\n  * [ __ View original  ](/library/document.ashx?g=180c5ebf-640e-45f2-9ce7-a0e3b9075d89 \"View the original document this article came from\")\n  * [ __ Forward  ](mailto:?body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20be%20interested%20in%20this%20article%20on%20Lexology%3A%20Flipping%20up%2C%20not%20out%3A%20navigating%20the%20path%20to%20introducing%20a%20US%20holdco.%20%0A%0D%0AYou%20can%20access%20the%20article%20for%20free%20using%20this%20link%3A%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lexology.com%2Fr.ashx%3Fl%3D8V8JJA8%20%0A%0D%0ALexology.com%20-%20legal%20intelligence.&subject=Lexology%3A%20Flipping%20up%2C%20not%20out%3A%20navigating%20the%20path%20to%20introducing%20a%20US%20holdco. \"Forward this article to a colleague via email\")\n  * [ __ Print  ](javascript:LogPrint\\(\\); window.print\\(\\); \"Print this article\")\n  * __ Share\n\n    * [ __Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d0d6d17cd-bede-4769-9e34-01297cbc945a)\n    * [ __Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?status=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d0d6d17cd-bede-4769-9e34-01297cbc945a)\n    * [ __Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d0d6d17cd-bede-4769-9e34-01297cbc945a&title=&summary=&source=)\n\n  * __ Follow \n\nPlease login to follow content.\n\n  * [Like](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d0d6d17cd-bede-4769-9e34-01297cbc945a)\n\n__\n\nadd to folder:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n  * My saved (default)\n  * Read later ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\nFolders shared with you\n\n  * ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n### Filed under\n\n  * [Australia](/hub/australia)\n  * [USA](/hub/usa)\n  * [Company & Commercial](/hub/company-and-commercial)\n  * [Corporate Finance/M&A](/hub/corporate-finance-m-and-a)\n  * [Tax](/hub/tax)\n  * [Lander & Rogers](/search/?f=22447)\n\n### Popular articles from this firm\n\n  1. #####  [ The Jobkeeper Payment: Employment Law Issues * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=4160a0c0-b4f8-4a7e-93b5-0a356862c58d)\n\n  2. #####  [ Directors' Duties: Federal Court gives Directors a 'heads up' on s180(1) * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=7c510f52-5116-4111-ac21-5b5b61a669e5)\n\n  3. #####  [ Eight things we learnt from the PM's press conference about the proposed mandatory industry code for commercial leases * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=e8bfa196-c5e6-4534-9739-7c5bafd24354)\n\n  4. #####  [ Insights into the \"doctrine of frustration\" in relation to commercial leases * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=1d94de7c-3604-4cc3-a466-a6dbb04ed62f)\n\n  5. #####  [ COVID-19: Temporary changes to insolvency laws * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=0944ee10-4e08-4598-a93a-eade04cb6e5d)\n\nIf you would like to learn how Lexology can drive your content marketing\nstrategy forward, please email\n[enquiries@lexology.com](mailto:enquiries@lexology.com \"Email us\").\n\n![Powered by Lexology](/images/redesign_2015/Powered_by_Lexology_Logo-\nprint.png)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nFrom force majeure to employment issues - follow the latest thinking from the\nworld's leading business law firms as the virus continues to spread.\n\n[Visit research centre](https://www.lexology.com/research/hubs/coronavirus)\n\n### Featured Video\n\n[ PRO ![Brandon H.\nGraves](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/author/3099/W120/H120/20190625054023/Brandon_H_Graves.jpg)\n](/learn/video/why-you-need-a-data-map)\n\n__3:22 min\n\n#### Brandon H.

venture capital firm that brings togther the disparate worlds of\ncybersecurity, human resources tech and Australian business bigwig Geoff Levy.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nCo-founder of OUR Innovation Fund Geoff Levy. Nic Walker\n\nAnd it's after more money.\n\nStreet Talk understands that OUR Innovation Fund is out drumming up interest\nfor its second fund to the tune of $75 million, targeting high-net-worth\nindividuals.\n\nThe firm has already raised $50 million and wants to close the raising's first\nround at the end of the month. It planned to kick things off again in the new\nyear and hit the $75 million target by March.\n\nIt would be the second fund for the firm, which counts Levy as a co-founder\nand comes out of the Monash Private Capital stable, which is his investment\nand advisory firm. Levy is also the former chief executive of Investec\nAustralia and chairs the ASX-listed Cromwell Property Group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOUR Innovation's first fund was worth $50 million and has deployed the first\n$30 million in the likes of Advanced Navigation, the navigation tech company\nthat counts Tesla and NASA as clients, and enboarder, a staff on-boarding\nbusiness that's worked with Qantas and Canva.\n\nThe fund was also invested in Kasada, a cybersecurity firm that provides a\ncloud-based solution to identifying and stopping malicious attacks from bots.\nKasada has offices in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia.\n\nIt is understood the remaining $20 million in OUR Innovation's first fund was\npegged for follow-on investments.\n\nThe first fund used the federal government's Early Stage Venture Capital\nPartnerships (ESVCP) program, which provides tax benefits to fund managers but\ncomes with some investment restrictions.\n\nWhile the second fund would be an ESVCP, it would have the option to invest in\nnon-approved assets like lending companies.\n\n## Get a first look at tomorrow's headlines\n\nSign up to the Street Talk First Look newsletter\n\n[Sign Up\nNow](https://login.myfairfax.com.au/beta/members/my_account/newsletters?callback_uri=https://www.afr.com&channel_key=9ME3ACTT4ZYY1fEMfvR2EA)\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\n[License\narticle](http://rightsportal.copyright.com.au/pages/republicationpage.aspx?author=Sarah%20Thompson%20and%20Anthony%20Macdonald%20and%20Tim%20Boyd&publication=AFR&publicationdate=2019-11-21T10%3A13%3A50Z&publisher=fxj&title=Geoff%20Levy%20co-\nfounded%20VC%20firm%20raising%20for%20new%20fund&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fstreet-\ntalk%2Fgeoff-levy-co-founded-vc-firm-raising-for-new-fund-20191121-p53cnp)\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [Street Talk](/street-talk)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Capital raising](/topic/capital-raising-1mp7)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Geoff Levy](/person/geoff-levy-316)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n **[Sarah Thompson](/by/sarah-thompson-j7ger)** has co-edited the Street Talk\ncolumn since 2009, specialising in private equity, investment banking, mergers\n& acquisitions and equity capital markets stories.

But you know you've got a major problem on your\nhands if your new employees are quick to exit.\n\nThe total cost of losing an employee is estimated to range from 90 to 200 per\ncent of the employee's annual salary. But it's bad for business beyond the\nobvious costs of finding, hiring and training replacement staff.\n\nWhen an employee walks out the door, it impacts your business immediately -\nand you also lose everything that employee may have contributed to your\nbusiness over the next few years, perhaps even decades.  \n\nYou lose the business knowledge that's in their head and the relationships\nthey've built with colleagues and stakeholders and it causes a general\ndisruption in the day-to-day flow of the organization. It can also be a major\ndistraction for your other staff members.\n\n  **A high turnover at your business can also:**\n\n*         Harm customer service and quality\n\n*         Compromise your competitive advantage\n\n*         Kill motivation and morale\n\n According to analysis by LinkedIn, the worldwide average staff turnover rate\nis 10.9 per cent, with these industries struggling with higher than average\nrates:\n\n*         Tech - 13.2 per cent\n\n*         Retail -13 per cent\n\n*         Media and entertainment - 11.4 per cent\n\n*         Professional services - 11.4 per cent\n\n*         Government, education and nonprofit - 11.2 per cent\n\n\n\nDon't get us wrong - natural turnover is healthy and normal. But if you are\nseeing high turnover, that's a red flag. Generally, turnover rates have been\non the rise recently, so you should look at your churn rates in the wider\ncontext of industry trends and organization-specific issues.\n\n **Can I Just Blame This on Industry Trends?**  \n\n\nSorry, but shrugging and saying \"that's just how the industry is at the\nmoment\" isn't going to convince anyone.\n\n The best way to see just how well you're doing in turnover rates is to see\nhow you fit within the wider industry. Then look at what action you can take\nto beat the industry benchmark.\n\n Retail, for example, has a reputation as a high-churn industry. This is\nbecause of:\n\n*         Typically low pay, making it easy for other stores to lure your people to greener pastures\n\n*         Entry level jobs for most young people, who don't plan for retail to be their longer term career\n\n*         Managers are often promoted from sales positions and may not be great natural people managers\n\n*         Boom and bust cycles, and the pressure to get workers up and running ASAP, causing training, development and onboarding (you know, the things that improve retention) to be neglected.\n\nThe tech industry, on the other hand, sees high turnover and massive\nchallenges retaining talent. This is because of skills shortage, high demand\nand cashed up competitors ready to pay top dollar to poach your best people.\n\n The top talent in tech also tend to be highly ambitious, being \"eager to jump\non new opportunities... as employers and offers get more competitive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, project-based industries like media and entertainment may see staff\ncome and go as projects start and end.\n\n **Can Buying a Ping Pong Table Fix Things?**\n\nGood try, but even a beer tap won't stop your best people from leaving if\nthere are bigger issues at play.\n\nIf talented people are treating your organization like a short stay truck\nstop, it's time to ask some serious questions:\n\n*         Are people leaving because you're recruiting people who aren't actually a good fit for the job and for the culture?\n\n*         Did their expectations not match the reality?\n\n*         Are they leaving for better pay? Or better growth opportunities?\n\n*         Is pervasive low morale creating a path to the exit door?\n\n*         Are they simply leaving a good job for a great one?\n\n\n\nResearch shows staff turnover is one of the most expensive and difficult\nworkforce challenges facing organizations.\n\nWhatever the reason, there are things that you can do to improve staff\nretention rates, and understanding the underlying factors can help focus on\nwhat will have the biggest impact in your organization.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

success.\n\nHer job as customer success director for a human resources IT company in\nSydney places her in one of the highest demand roles going, according to\nanalysis from jobs and social media giant LinkedIn.\n\nOakley says it is a role makes use of her past experience in accounts\nmanagement and traditional customer service.\n\n![Tegan Oakley, Customer Success Director

Oakley, Customer Success Director at Enboarder.Credit:Jessica Hromas\n\n\"Typically, customer service back in the day was more of a reactive service.\nNow customer success is seen as a consultative arm of the business that adds\nvalue to customers and ensures they meet their objectives,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What is surprising is how much of a demand that customer success has become.\"\n\nLinkedIn's analysis of millions of jobs for a five-year period counted the\nfrequencies of job titles held in 2013 compared with titles held in 2017.\n\n\"Customer success jobs have grown 38 per cent year on year over the last 12\nmonths,\" Jason Laufer, senior director of learning and talent solutions at\nLinkedIn says.\n\nThe top five roles were:\n\n **Customer success manager:** managing software, customer relationships and\nconsulting.\n\n **Data scientist:** Skilled in using digital **** analytics and data mining\n\n **Full stack engineer:** Help make sense of mountains of data and skilled in\nsoftware engineering and can include working with Java computer programming.\n\n **Cyber security expert:** Skilled in computer and information security,\nconsulting and security management.\n\nLoading\n\n **Experience designer:** Makes digital services including apps and websites\neasier to use through research and testing.\n\nHe says it is no surprise that tech roles dominated the top emerging jobs.\n\nLaufer says new business models fuelled by technology and software services\nhad increased demand for customer success managers, which were not popular\nfive years ago.\n\n\"Organisations now place immense value in maintaining positive engagement with\ncustomers,\" he says.\n\n\"As a result, roles which require strong skills in human interaction and soft\nskills such as communication and collaboration have exploded.\" ****\n\nThe LinkedIn data found that many employers were looking for a combination of\nsoft skills and technology.\n\n[License

When you put this lens over the topic of induction, a lot of traditional\npractices don't make sense anymore.\n\nA traditional induction has two key pieces:\n\n  * You learn about the company (who they are, what they do, what their values are)\n  * You learn about the job (\"how do I become a salesperson\")\n\nOften companies want to run inductions that are intense and short in order to\nget their new hires ramped up and productive as soon as possible. The issue\nis, this approach leads to \"death by PowerPoint\". It's overwhelming and\ninformation just doesn't stick, thus defeating the purpose.\n\n **Experience Counts**  \n  \nUsing an experience lens gives a totally different perspective to induction\n(and onboarding more broadly).\n\nDay one is often an anxious day for a new hire. It turns out that humans are\nhardwired that way; it's a natural response when people are in new situations.\nIt's not the time to turn the information fire hose on full strength. On day\none, forget what you want. If you invest in making new hires feel welcome,\ncomfortable and part of the company, they will learn far more, and faster,\nthan if you don't.  \n\n **Get Out of the Classroom**\n\nWith the experience lens on, you'll think of Day one as an opportunity to make\nit an amazing experience for that person.\n\nFor instance, instead of asking them to set foot in the office on Day one,\nmeet the team at a coffee shop, go out and explore the city, and perhaps, have\ndinner together. The goal is to give them an amazing story to tell when\nsomeone asks them, \"How was your first day\". You can empower people by giving\nthem choices and thinking more deeply about the experience you offer on Day\none.\n\nLetting people pick their tech before they start, assigning them buddies who\ncan give them a personal tour, taking them to lunch, and organizing more\ninformal meetings with senior leadership team members are all good options.\nEven small things like considering having people start on a Tuesday rather\nthan a Monday can have a big impact on someone's experience.\n\nEven though it takes five or six months for the average employee to become\nfully productive, inductions are traditionally limited to a certain period of\ntime. If you switch your focus and make it last longer you can trickle out\ninfo in bite-sized pieces to make it more digestible and more engaging. Your\nemployees will also retain information better.\n\nBy 2020, millennials are expected to constitute half of the global workforce\nand these workers expect technology to work instantly and integrate seamlessly\ninto their lives. They are used to being offered self-service options want to\nfeel appreciated and valued.\n\nWhen the onboarding process isn't executed well, you are at risk of\ndisengaging with your new hires before they even start. Then when they show up\non Day one for eight hours of text-heavy slides, it can be the beginning of\nthe end.\n\n\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

The report evaluated 14 vendors and Sitecore was\npositioned in the Leaders quadrant based on the ability to execute and\ncompleteness of vision. Sitecore Experience Platform\u2122 (XP) was assessed as\npart of the company's evaluation.\n\nGartner defines a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) as \"an integrated and\ncohesive piece of technology designed to enable the composition, management,\ndelivery and optimization of contextualized digital experiences across\nmultiexperience customer journeys.\" In addition, Gartner notes that, \"DXPs act\nas centers of gravity in a complex, extensive and interconnected technology\nlandscape. Organizations need to deliver highly contextualized experiences \u2013\nnot just simple websites and mobile apps \u2013 for an increasing variety of\nmodalities and channels across the customer journey.\"\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [ _TechBytes with Vinayak Nair, VP Research\nOps and Custom Analytics at Verto Analytics_](https://martechseries.com/mts-\ninsights/guest-authors/digital-transformation-move-fast-get-technology-way/)\n\n\"The DXP category evolved from the expansion of web content management,\nportal, and e-commerce solutions but it's now abundantly clear that these\nalone can't address marketers' needs to build personalized experiences across\nan increasing number of channels,\" said [Desta\nPrice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/destaprice/), executive vice president,\nproduct management at Sitecore. \"Content is the backbone of digital\nexperiences, which is why delivery solutions such as WCM must be complemented\nby applications for content planning, collaboration, curation, and performance\nmeasurement. We believe Gartner positions us as a Leader because we are the\nonly vendor able to manage the end-to-end content lifecycle with one connected\ndigital marketing platform.\"\n\nAccording to Gartner, \"Leaders have ample ability to support a variety of DXP\nuse cases and consistently meet customers' needs over substantial periods.\nLeaders have delivered significant product innovation in pursuit of DXP\nrequirements, and have been successful in selling to new customers across\nindustries.\"\n\n_**Marketing Technology News:**_ [Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality\nProjected as a \u2018Game-Changer\u2019 for Future of\nContent](https://martechseries.com/predictive-ai/augmented-reality/virtual-\nreality-and-augmented-reality-future-of-content/)\n\nSitecore's fully integrated digital experience platform enables the world's\nleading brands to create meaningful connections with their customers through\nrelevant digital experiences that leverage omnichannel content, seamless\ncommerce, and continuous personalization.

What you don\u2019t hear about nearly as much, however, are the\nmyriad ways that technologies powered by AI are transforming routine processes\nand common frustrations, and helping businesses handle mundane tasks so\nemployees can focus on more interesting work.\n\nThere is perhaps no better example of this than [content\ngeneration](https://martechseries.com/category/content/content-marketing/)\nsoftware, powered by AI and [Natural Language\nProcessing](https://martechseries.com/category/predictive-ai/ml-nlp/) (NLP).\nContent generation software is incredibly intuitive and easy to use: most\ncompanies can start generating content like BSS reports,\n[e-commerce](https://martechseries.com/tag/e-commerce/) product descriptions,\nnews content like weather reports, and more within a manner of minutes by\ninputting basic information via an Excel spreadsheet. The natural language\ngeneration (NLG) market includes my company, AX Semantics, as well as other\nleaders like Arria, Narrative Science, Yseop and Automated Insights.\n\n_**Read More:**_ [Redefining Promo and Sports Highlight Creation Using\nAI](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/redefining-promo-\nsports-highlight-creation-using-ai/ \"View Redefining Promo and Sports\nHighlight Creation Using AI\")\n\nHere are five common pain points content generation software can help\nbusinesses solve:\n\n### **1\\. Scaling and Entering New Markets**\n\nEntering a new market, particularly a foreign one, is a challenge for any\nbusiness. Say you are an online retailer based in the US who sells women\u2019s\nshoes. You have content in the form of product descriptions - but only in the\nEnglish language. That won\u2019t help you much if you hope to sell shoes in China.\nYou\u2019ll need product descriptions in Chinese if you want to enter that market,\nwhich means you now need to pay for translators. If the translation quality is\npoor or inaccurate, you now have other problems, such as poor SEO, low\nconversion rates, high product returns, and more. Building your business at\nscale quickly becomes problematic if you use the old method, but if you use\ncontent generation software scale is not an issue because language is no\nlonger a barrier. You simply input basic facts via a spreadsheet or similar\nmethod and get unique content in a different language.\n\n### **2\\. Regulatory Demands**\n\nMany businesses are mandated by law to routinely change forms, contracts, and\ndocuments. A bank, for example, might be required to update risk assessments\nfor every active plan on a quarterly basis. Content generation software\nprovides an easy way to handle these relentless demands. In the past countless\nwriters would need to go through forms or documents, items like forms and\ncontracts, whereas now with content generation software, they are easily\nupdated simply by inputting updated information into a spreadsheet.\n\n### **3\\. Lack Of Fresh Content**\n\nAll companies need to think of themselves as media companies. Your presence on\n[social media](https://martechseries.com/tag/social-media-platform/) and blogs\nis a key way to communicate with your audience. If you let content get stale\nor don\u2019t update your sites, you will lose potential customers. How do you get\nthis done? Equip writers and content creators with software that enables them\nto constantly create unique content. \u201cHybrid\u201d content borne from a partnership\nbetween man and machine fills the need for fresh, vital content around the\nclock, linked to the underlying data, and auto-updating if that data changes.\n\n### **4\\. Writing Jobs**\n\nIt\u2019s a tough time to be a professional writer or be a company that wants to\nkeep a writer gainfully employed. Writers, such as journalists or content\nproducers are under enormous pressure to create fresh content that can be\nchanged and updated at a moment\u2019s notice. Working with content generation\nsoftware allows them to not only fulfill but exceed their job requirements and\nexpectations. It also allows them to create more content so their employers\ncan thrive. The writing jobs of the future will doubtless have a content\ngeneration software component. AI is also helping journalists do better work\n-- a newspaper in Germany, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, won the [prestigious\nEuropean Newspaper Award\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Newspaper_Award)for reporting on fine\nparticle and nitrous oxide pollution in the Stuttgart area using AI and\ncontent generation.\n\n### **5\\. Apathetic Customers**\n\nOnline shoppers are turned off by stale content, bad photos, descriptions that\ndon\u2019t match what they see on their computer or mobile device, and outdated\ninformation. A[ recent survey\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2018/05/24/this-is-what-\nconsumers-do-while-theyre-shopping-online/%23181a5cde12b9)indicated that 87\npercent of shoppers said clear images were important to them. Content\ngeneration software provides a better, more thoughtful way to reach potential\ncustomers, particularly those looking for a specific item. Customers are\nbetter informed and are likely to shop and buy more when accurate, precise\ncopy is generated. When customers find what they want quickly, they also spend\nless time on e-commerce and can be more productive in their daily lives.\n\nAs we continue to look to AI to make big changes in our lives, let\u2019s not\nforget the many ways it\u2019s already being used to resolve problems that have\nchallenged businesses for decades. Content generation software is just one way\na partnership between man and machine is reimagining what is possible.\n\n_**Read More:**_ [AI 2020 Predictions From Tom Libretto, CMO at Pega \u2013 What\u2019s\nNext for Marketing?](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-\nauthors/ai-2020-predictions-tom-libretto-cmo-pega-whats-next-marketing/ \"View\nAI 2020 Predictions From Tom Libretto, CMO at Pega \u2013 What\u2019s Next for\nMarketing?\")\n\n__[Arria](https://martechseries.com/tag/arria/)[AX\nSemantics](https://martechseries.com/tag/ax-semantics/)[content\ngeneration](https://martechseries.com/tag/content-generation/)[e-commerce\nproduct](https://martechseries.com/tag/e-commerce-product/)[Narrative\nScience](https://martechseries.com/tag/narrative-science/)[Natural Language\nProcessing](https://martechseries.com/tag/natural-language-\nprocessing/)[SEO](https://martechseries.com/tag/seo/)[Social\nMedia](https://martechseries.com/tag/social-\nmedia/)[YSEOP](https://martechseries.com/tag/yseop/)\n\n[__**0**](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/ai-powered-\ncontent-generation-software-solves-five-common-business-pains/#respond \"Leave\na comment on: \u201cHow AI-Powered Content Generation Software Solves Five Common\nBusiness Pains\u201d\") __**580**\n\n__**Share**\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2Fai-powered-content-generation-software-solves-five-\ncommon-business-pains%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/share?text=How+AI-\nPowered+Content+Generation+Software+Solves+Five+Common+Business+Pains&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2Fai-powered-content-generation-software-solves-five-\ncommon-business-\npains%2F)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2Fai-powered-content-generation-software-solves-five-\ncommon-business-pains%2F&title=How+AI-\nPowered+Content+Generation+Software+Solves+Five+Common+Business+Pains)\n\n[ ](https://martechseries.com/author/robert-weibgraeber/ \"Browse Author\nArticles\")\n\n[Robert Weibgraeber](https://martechseries.com/author/robert-weibgraeber/)\n\nRobert is the MD & CTO at AX Semantics \u2013 Natural Language Generation.\n\n__Prev Post\n\n[Aventri Announces Appointment of Jim Sharpe as CEO; Elevates Oni Chukwu to\nExecutive Chairman](https://martechseries.com/analytics/data-management-\nplatforms/aventri-announces-appointment-jim-sharpe-ceo-elevates-oni-chukwu-\nexecutive-chairman/)\n\nNext Post __\n\n[India to Become US$2.3 Billion Revenue Market for CRM Offerings in 2023, Says\nGlobalData](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/customer-experience-\nmanagement/india-become-us2-3-billion-revenue-market-crm-offerings-2023-says-\nglobaldata/)\n\nYou might also like More from author\n\n[Guest Authors](https://martechseries.com/category/mts-insights/guest-\nauthors/)\n\n[](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/sales-today-essential-\nchallenging-ever-optimizing-performance-time-uncertainty/ \"Sales Today Is More\nEssential and Challenging Than Ever: Optimizing Performance in a Time of\nUncertainty\")\n\n[ Sales Today Is More Essential and Challenging Than Ever: Optimizing\nPerformance in a\u2026 ](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-\nauthors/sales-today-essential-challenging-ever-optimizing-performance-time-\nuncertainty/ \"Sales Today Is More Essential and Challenging Than Ever:\nOptimizing Performance in a Time of Uncertainty\")\n\n[Guest Authors](https://martechseries.com/category/mts-insights/guest-\nauthors/)\n\n[](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/dear-google-\nsuggestion/ \"Dear Google\u2026I have a Suggestion!\")\n\n[ Dear Google\u2026I have a Suggestion!

Some of\nthe key benefits that are forfeited include, annual leave, sick leave and\ncompany bonuses but other company benefits should be extended to help bring\nthe workforce together.\n\nLike all things in life and business it's all about customer experience and\nthis is never truer for a contingent worker. Too many times we hear stories of\ncontractors being left in reception, not being shown where the toilets are and\ncontractors that are not given a log on or lap top days  after they've started\n- imagine how that would make you feel? First impressions really do count and\nif they are negative, it won't help get the most out of your workforce and\nultimately can be very damaging to your brand.\n\n What little things can make a big difference?\n\n  * Someone to meet them (with a smile) at reception\n  * Full on-boarding and initiation\n  * Introduction to immediate team and key stakeholders\n  * Invite to team/company meetings\n  * Invited to the right e-mail groups to receive company updates/information\n\nGoing the extra mile will reap benefits:\n\n  * Buddy up - teaming a contingent worker with a permanent employee who knows the ropes is a great way to help with orientation and answering all those little questions. This is particularly important in a large, complex organisation\n  * Organise a coffee or lunch on their first day with immediate team to make them feel welcome\n  * Make sure they have a name badge on their desk and that an e-mail goes around explaining who they are and what they have joined to do\n  * Any internal functions or social club engagements, make sure they are given the option to attend\n\n**Technology**  \nThere are now many online tools that can be used to on-board your workforce\nand also to gauge how your workforce is 'feeling'. For example, receiving an\nSMS from the CEO welcoming you on your first day is a great way to make\nsomeone feel that they are a part of the team. These types of tools can also\nbe used for reminding staff to complete company specific new starter training\nsuch as Work Health and Safety.\n\nTwo of the leading tech companies that offer these services are Culture Amp\n[www.cultureamp.com](http://www.cultureamp.com) and enboarder\n[www.enboarder.com](http://www.enboarder.com).\n\nSurveys and online feedback tools are being used by consultancies to stay in\ncontact with their contractors and measure the level of engagement or\nhighlight any contractors with red flags. These responses can then be\ncommunicated with the client and potentially stop any early issues or\nconcerns.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218771)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218771)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637215104111082460.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-track-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n#### [How to keep mental health on track during remote\nworking](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-\ntrack-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\n**Everyone loves achieving a goal!**  \nAnother great driver of a workforce is hitting a goal or a target. Whether it\nbe an individual goal or a company target if your contingent workforce is part\nof that process and they are included in the progress and reporting they will\nfeel like they are adding value, so set goals and explain why it is important\nfor them and the business. Don't forget, if you achieve the goal to include\nthem in the celebration!\n\n**Golden handcuffs**  \nIf you are hiring a team of individuals with unique skillsets the last thing\nyou want is for them to walk offsite five months into a six month project with\nall the IP and no handover. The downside to a contingent workforce is the\nshort notice periods and lack of ownership and this does open up the\npossibility of contractors not seeing out the full tenure of their contract.\n\nIf a completion fee is placed on the assignment it can reduce the risk of\ncontractors leaving at a crucial stage of the assignment and therefore will\nreduce the possibility of increased cost and deadlines being missed. While\noffering a remuneration bonus on the completion of a task or project may not\nbe a favoured approach by many companies, it can be very effective for highly\nspecific and critical projects.\n\n**Communication**  \nThe most common complaint we receive from contractors is the lack of\nindividual communication.\n\nMake sure that all your contractors are receiving regular one on ones and\nupdates as to how they are getting on performance wise and seek their\nfeedback.\n\nWhen their contract is two months from completion start talking to them about\nwhat will happen next. You might not be able to give them all the information\nor to tell them they will be extended but they need to be kept in the loop.\n\nOur research shows that at 7 weeks out from contract completion contingent\nworkers will start looking for their next assignment. This isn't a sign of\ndisloyalty, one of the key goals for a contingent worker is to make sure they\nhave continued employment and if there is no communication they need to look\nafter themselves!  \n  \n**My top 5 tips to keep contingent workers engaged**\n\n  1. Make their first day a great day through Introduction, on boarding and technology set up\n  2. Set clear goals and expectations \n  3. Utilise any internal tools and surveys to get a health-check\n  4. Have regular catch ups (formal or informal)\n  5. Update and renew their contract as early as possible (if unsure just communicate that with them)\n\n  \n_Owen Jones is the general manager (Vic) of Davidson Technology.

(Special to The Forum)\n\nDorsey, the keynote speaker for Minnesota State University Moorhead\u2019s\n\u201cTransforming Workplaces\u201d event Feb. 7, said Gen Z is very focused on making\nan impact.\n\n\u201cThey are very much attracted to employers that have a mission to make the\nworld a better place in addition to making a profit,\u201d Dorsey said Monday, Jan.\n21. \u201cThey really bring a lot of skills that are very exciting in terms of how\nthey use technology and think about innovating. So, we\u2019re very bullish on Gen\nZ entering the workforce and the values that they bring.\u201d\n\nDorsey said members of Gen Z have a different relationship with technology\nthan previous generations, \u201cbecause many of them do not remember a time before\nsocial media or smart phones. And so, what they consider normal in terms of\ntechnology, is a big shift compared to previous generations.\u201d\n\nThat seems to describe Simmons\u2019 world well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new trend all the time. There\u2019s a new meme all the time. And the\nyounger generation just has the ability to latch onto it so much quicker,\u201d\nSimmons said. \u201cAs far as being tech savvy, I feel like anytime there\u2019s a new\nplatform, or there\u2019s a new tool, I\u2019m all over it, I\u2019m trying to learn it,\nbecause you never know what is going to be the big one to hit. You never know\nwhat\u2019s going to be the next TikTok, or the next Facebook or things like that.\nAnd I think there are a lot of people out there that are itching to be the\nexpert in those things.\n\n# Change is expected\n\nDorsey said there is a perception that younger generations are more\ncomfortable with change than previous generations.\n\n\u201cBut what we actually see is that younger generations don\u2019t remember a time\nbefore rapid change and innovation. And so that is simply what they expect,\u201d\nDorsey said.\n\nOther generations can be just as good at adapting - if they want to be - and\n(if) the company has a culture of innovation, he said.\n\n\u201cWhere Gen Z has an advantage is many of the innovations, for example, in the\nworkplace or the marketplace are often tools and technologies that they are\naccustomed to. So, while It may look like change to others, it\u2019s actually all\nthey\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Dorsey said with a chuckle. \u201cWe like to say Generation Z\nrepresents the new normal.\u201d\n\nDorsey said Gen Z definitely wants a challenge in the workplace.\n\n\u201cThey want to know that they are valued, and that they have a voice. And when\nit comes to change, a lot of times, when you dig deeper, what they want is\ndiversity of work and the ability to be more creative and try new things,\nrather than actually driving the change themselves. \u2026 Getting to do\ninteresting, or at least try different types of work within a workplace. That\nreally seems to connect with them,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nGen Z is also looking for opportunities for growth, Dorsey said.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, what we see, is that Gen Z tells us they most want to develop\ntheir problem solving and public speaking skills,\u201d he said\n\n![Alexander Hook, pictured Wednesday, Jan. 22, is a data analyst for RDO\nEquipment Co.

Obviously, in a long career, that\u2019s a very day-by-day process, just\nconstantly learning and improving,\u201d he said.\n\nHook expects workplaces will be changing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be interesting to look forward (to the) next five or\nsix years as more of the generation kind of enters the workforce,\u201d Hook said.\n\u201cI think it will be interesting seeing how workplaces change, going forward. I\nthink we\u2019re just at the cusp of seeing what our generation is going to bring\nto the table.\u201d\n\n# Stability is valued\n\n\u201cThe irony that\u2019s not talked about a lot of times, but has come through\nstrongly in our research is that Gen Z is also attracted to companies that\nthey view as stable, because they\u2019ve come of age after the Great Recession,\nand they\u2019ve also seen Millennials frequently struggle,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nThey want a place where they can build a career, \u201cif they decide that the\ncompany is a fit for them after they\u2019ve worked there.\u201d\n\n![Mara Zupko, pictured Thursday, Jan. 23, works in communications and\nmarketing for Noridian Healthcare Solutions in Fargo. \\(Helmut Schmidt / The\nForum\\)](https://www.inforum.com/incoming/4878603-qhibo1-012520.B.FFWORKPLACEGENZ04.jpg/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/012520.B.FFWORKPLACEGENZ04.jpg)\n\nMara Zupko, pictured Thursday, Jan. 23, works in communications and marketing\nfor Noridian Healthcare Solutions in Fargo.

Zupko said\nworking for an established firm was a priority.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s not shaky, It\u2019s really solid and their teams are solid. They\u2019ve\nbeen doing this for a long time. I trust their process for how they do\nthings,\u201d Zupko said.\n\nBut company culture is important, too.\n\n\u201cI just really wanted to work for a company that is a good company. But also,\nI just wanted to make sure it was something I could go to everyday and still\nfeel happy and not dread getting up in the morning,\u201d Zupko said.\n\n\u201cYou want to be proud of the place you work for. It\u2019s kind of like how you\nwant to make your parents proud. You want to make your company proud. \u2026 You\nwant to feel like you\u2019re not coming to work for nothing. Like you\u2019re doing\nsomething or making a difference, whatever it may be,\u201d Zupko said.\n\n# Give them a better start\n\nHow can employers help Gen Z get a better start in the workplace?\n\nDorsey has a few suggestions:\n\nFirst, present job and career offers and opportunities in a way that connects\nwith Gen. Z, and be candid and clear on what various jobs entail..\n\nSecond, employers can do a better job with onboarding Gen Z, he said.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a company called Enboarder, which does onboarding by text\nmessage. \u2026 \u201cso they (younger workers) are prepared to show up for work and\nfeel very welcomed. And that has had really significant impacts and very\ndifferent from the typical first day of here\u2019s your printed manual. Here\u2019s all\nthe ways you can get fired,\u201d Dorsey said with a laugh.\n\nThird, consider earned wage access, which helps employees better handle\nunexpected expenses and avoid late or overdraft fees, Dorsey said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a company called Instant Financial which enables employees to get\npaid half of their wages every day at no cost to them,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cNow\nwe\u2019re seeing a lot of employers offer this to Gen Z, because Gen Z will come\nof age only knowing that they can get access to some of their earned wages\nevery day.\u201d\n\n# Tips for Gen Z, too\n\nThere are also some things Gen Zers can do to help themselves in the work\nworld.\n\nFirst, the old saw of you only get one chance to make a first impression still\napplies.\n\n\u201cBeing prepared for that first day and that first week makes a big difference.\nDoing research ahead of time and doing what you can before you start a new\njob, so you\u2019re prepared when you get there, we find is really a benefit and\nalso reduces stress and anxiety for Gen Z,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\n\u201cThe second thing we teach them is to ask for help. Because many times, when\nyou\u2019re the youngest employee, or in a group or a team or a company you may not\nbe inclined to ask for help because you don\u2019t want to look like you don\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re doing or you don\u2019t have the experience,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cBut the\ntruth is, that people generally want to help you, and it\u2019s better to ask for\nhelp than to make mistakes and have to learn the hard way.\u201d\n\nThe third thing Gen Zers need to be aware of is how they appear on social\nmedia.\n\n\u201cJust be thoughtful that the impression you put out there can have a much more\nlonger lasting impact than you would think,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\n### Related Topics\n\n[WORKFORCE](/tags/workforce)\n\n[GENERATION Z](/tags/GENERATION_Z)\n\n[WORKPLACE](/tags/workplace)\n\n[BUSINESS](/tags/business-1)\n\n[BENEFITS](/tags/benefits)\n\n## Suggested Articles\n\n[ ![O\u2019Leary\u2019s Irish Pub & Grill, 808 30th Ave. S., has closed indefinitely,\naccording to a Facebook post Monday, Jan. 20.

Traditionally this had been achieved by collecting and\nprocessing batches of data from disconnected sources and availing them in a\nmarketer-friendly manner.\n\nToday\u2019s rapidly changing customer requires brands to keep their unified\nrecords updated with realtime data. As a result, CDPs need to evolve to\ncombine realtime event streaming (such as when a purchase is made, inventory\nchanges, etc.) with their existing batch processing capabilities.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [SiteZeus Names Jim Mizes, Retired Blaze\nPizza CEO, to its Board of\nDirectors](https://martechseries.com/analytics/behavioral-marketing/location-\ndata/sitezeus-names-jim-mizes-retired-blaze-pizza-ceo-board-directors/)\n\nOptimove\u2019s new database infrastructure brings marketers and data analysts\ncloser than ever before to all their customer data. With Optidata in place,\nbrands can seamlessly share all the up-to-date unified data with any internal\nsystem, leverage it to power proprietary models, and access it to create any\ncustom attribute desired.\n\nBy transitioning from pulling static tables, stored in isolated data systems,\nto connecting all sources through live streams of data, Optidata hurls\nOptimove\u2019s robust CDP into the future, providing a true leap into what used to\nbe a marketing utopia and is now a reality.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Legos Deploys Pareteum Experience Cloud For\nInternational Expansion](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/customer-\nexperience-management/legos-deploys-pareteum-experience-cloud-international-\nexpansion/)\n\nCEO and Founder of Optimove,[ Pini\nYakuel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piniyakuel/): \u201cOptimove has always prided\nitself on providing smart marketing teams with the technology they need to\nbuild emotionally intelligent relationships with their customers. Optidata is\na long-awaited innovation that enables marketers to leverage and visualize\nrealtime customer data within a CDP ensuring the right customers get the right\nmessages, through the right

[HR\ntechnology](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=HR+technology) seemed like the\nnext logical step in my career since it combines my years of experience in\nunderstanding the HR buyer with the fast-paced, agile environment of a [SaaS\ntechnology](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=SaaS+technology) company.\n\n#### **What galvanized you to start at Modern Hire?**\n\nThere was a lot to like about Modern Hire! It was (and still is) a company\ngrowing at a rate of 30% or more year-over-year. Our technology has a proven\nproduct-market fit, and our client base is comprised mainly of large, high-\nprofile enterprises, so I felt that there was a unique opportunity to tell a\npowerful story in the market about how our technology has helped some of the\nworld\u2019s biggest, most respected brands with the most complex talent ecosystems\nsolve their hiring challenges. I knew I wanted to lead the organization in\ntelling that story and directly contribute to our growth. And, perhaps most\nimportantly, the culture of the organization was the perfect fit for me!\n\n#### **At Modern Hire, which Marketing and Sales Technologies tools do you\ncurrently use?**\n\nAs our clients are large enterprises, we take measures to market like an\nenterprise, too. Our\n[MarTech](https://martechseries.com//?s=Marketing%20Technology) stack\ncontinues to evolve as we look to become more targeted and personalized in our\ntouchpoints with potential customers. Today, we use\n[Salesforce](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=Salesforce) and\n[Marketo](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=Marketo) as the main engines to\ndrive our Marketing outreach and understand our performance. We also leverage\n[Analytics](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=analytics) and Tracking Tools,\n[Marketing Automation](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=marketing+automation),\nTag Management, [CRM](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=CRM), Campaign\nManagement, Remarketing, Search Engine Marketing and Design tools to round out\nour Marketing and Sales efforts.\n\n#### **How does Modern Hire carve a niche for itself in the crowded HR\nTechnology space?**\n\nThe HR technology space is one of the fastest-growing and rapidly developing\nindustries, driving more than [$5\nbillion](https://www.workforce.com/2019/08/15/venture-capital-funding-frenzy-\nover-hr-technology-on-record-pace/) in projected investments in 2019 alone.\nThat\u2019s exciting to be apart of, but it does present a unique Marketing\nchallenge. [Modern Hire](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=Modern+Hire) stands\nout in this crowded space as the only comprehensive solution in the HR tech\nmarket that combines SaaS interviewing technology and workflow automation with\ndeep expertise in [AI](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=AI), [Predictive\nAnalytics](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=predictive%20analytics) and\n[Hiring Assessments](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=hiring+assessments).\n\nIn addition to being a crowded space, the HR technology market is also full of\ncompanies that have very similar-looking brand identities. To further stand\nout, Modern Hire recently underwent a rebrand that was grounded in the fact\nthat simplicity is best. Being direct and transparent is something we value as\nan organization and strive to do everyday within all aspects of our company \u2013\nwith our employees, with our clients, and most importantly, with our products.\n\nTransparent, seamless candidate experience is vital in the hiring process for\nboth candidates and recruiters, so our products must be simple and easy for\nall parties involved in the process. Modern Hire\u2019s brand, logo, and colors not\nonly reflect this simplicity, but also remind us of the values we strive to\nlive and provide to our clients everyday.\n\n#### **Could you tell us about your Ideal Customer profiles? Which industries\nand markets have been the fastest to adopt technologies you currently offer?**\n\nModern Hire\u2019s ideal clients are leading global enterprises that understand the\nvalue and importance of a strong employer brand and candidate experience in\ntheir recruiting and hiring efforts. Our clients understand the critical need\nto meet the expectations of modern candidates by offering personalized,\nengaging and data-driven hiring experiences.\n\nThough our clients operate in a variety of industries, we have seen the\nfastest adoption of our technologies in the Financial Services, Retail\nconsumer packaged goods, Consumer brands,\n[Healthcare](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=healthcare), and Staffing\nindustries.\n\nAt Modern Hire, our platform is configurable with open API and has the ability\nto sync with just about any application and applicant tracking system\nplatform.\n\n#### **Could you tell us more about your vision into growing revenue\nopportunities for HR Technology platforms?**\n\nAs businesses continue to evolve, [Talent\nAcquisition](https://www.techrseries.com/?s=talent+acquisition) and HR teams\nare transforming, too. Our vision at Modern Hire for growing revenue\nopportunities for our platform is very client-centric. It\u2019s built around the\nconstant push to solve the problems and challenges our clients within the\ntalent acquisition industry face on a daily basis.\n\nWith five different generations working side-by-side in today\u2019s modern\nworkplace, companies are faced with the challenge of factoring in a variety of\ndifferent levels of understanding, knowledge and work styles around\ntechnology, making it difficult to evaluate which HR technology tools are the\nright fit for their wide range of needs. As a result, it\u2019s imperative that\ncorporations take into account their total talent acquisition needs and\nprocesses during this evaluation to ensure the tools they eventually adopt\ntruly address their challenges and are the right fit for their hiring needs.\n\nHR technology solutions that leverage AI offer tremendous benefits to both\nrecruiters and candidates that other technology-fueled tools don\u2019t provide.\nFor instance, AI-powered HR technology solutions offer bias control and real-\ntime feedback, can predict candidate success on the job, have the ability to\nidentify flight risks before it\u2019s too late and much more.\n\nAt Modern Hire, we also understand that while there is a lot of excitement and\npositives around AI in HR and recruiting, there are also quite a few aspects\nof the technology that are unknown and unclear, both for recruiters and\ncandidates. In order to be successful in leveraging AI in hiring, companies\nneed to take a human-first approach to deployment and use. It\u2019s imperative\nthat HR teams take a glass-box approach to AI in the hiring process, meaning\ncandidates have full transparency into every step of the interviewing and\nhiring process \u2013 including how AI is being used along the way.\n\nAt Modern Hire, we work with our clients to ensure that our approach to AI\nsolves their specific hiring challenges with specific, measurable results. To\nensure that our AI solutions are benefitting not only companies but candidates\nas a whole, we establish ethical standards and create a fully transparent\nprocess \u2013 where both candidates and recruiters understand how and why the\ntechnology is being leveraged at all times.\n\n#### **How do you play a part in the Digital Transformation of such culture-\ndriven organizations?**\n\nIn the current landscape, talent acquisition and HR leaders agree that\nelevating and ensuring a positive candidate experience is the most important\npart of the hiring process. In fact, [recent\ndata](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-the-latest-north-american-candidate-\nexperience-report/) from CandE proves this true, with 73% of companies saying\nthat [candidate\nexperience](https://www.techrseries.com/?s=candidate%20experience) is their #1\nhiring priority this year. When the candidate experience is elevated,\nrecruiters are able to attract and retain talent that have both the skillset\nand culture fit needed to be successful within and provide value to the\norganization.\n\n[Digital\nTransformation](https://www.martechseries.com/?s=Digital%20Transformation) is\nvital to this process \u2013 especially when it comes to prioritizing the candidate\nexperience. Recruiters are faced with time-consuming tasks everyday, including\nreading and reviewing resumes, coordinating back and forth with candidates to\nschedule interviews, and answering any and all questions that candidates may\nhave about an open job position or an interview. At the surface level,\nintegrating modern technologies like text-message recruiting and interviewing\nscheduling tools automate these tasks and in return, give recruiters the time\nback in their day to do the most important aspects of their job-creating real,\ngenuine relationships with candidates.\n\nWhen we take this a step further and look at HR teams that use [Deep\nLearning](https://martechseries.com//?s=Deep%20Learning) and AI in their\nhiring processes, we start to see that companies are able to create, foster\nand maintain culture-driven organizations because of their ability to leverage\nour technology to make better, smarter and data-driven hiring decisions.\n\n#### **Which start-ups in the tech industry interest you the most and why?**\n\nFor one, I find companies that look at and analyze the different ways that\nwork is being done \u2013 especially in today\u2019s workforce with upwards of 5\ngenerations in any given company \u2013 particularly fascinating. Additionally,\ncompanies that understand what motivates individuals to join and stay at their\norganization and foster ways to build the new generation of leaders and\nworkers entering the workforce have really stuck out to me.\n\n#### **What technologies within AI and HR Technology are you interested in?**\n\nAs a marketer in the HR Tech space, I\u2019m especially drawn to companies that\nhave compelling brand stories that highlight their mission and are on a\nmission to solve fundamental workplace challenges we\u2019re all dealing with on a\ndaily basis. In particular, [MentorcliQ](https://www.mentorcliq.com/), a\nsoftware that focuses on mentoring and [15Five](https://www.15five.com/), an\n[employee engagement](https://martechseries.com//?s=employee%20engagement)\nplatform, are two companies that I personally admire.\n\n#### **What\u2019s your smartest work-related shortcut or productivity hack?**\n\nOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve learned over the course of my career that has\nhelped me grow as a leader is to always be fully engaged. Putting technology\naway is necessary to be fully engaged in critical conversations \u2013 both at work\nand at home. Focus yields productivity!\n\n**Thank you, Terri!

Because of the advanced nature of their\ninstruments and software, more than half of Waters' employees are in sales and\nservice, working closely with customers to set up, calibrate and deploy\ntechnologies in labs worldwide. To build deeper customer relationships,\nprovide superior service and scale internationally, the company selected\nSalesforce as its global CRM platform.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_**[Demand Spring Expands Dynamic Leadership\nTeam](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/b2b-commerce/demand-spring-\nexpands-dynamic-leadership-team/)\n\nIn order to get its lab instruments and measurement software in the hands of\nthe buyer, Waters needed a cloud-based CRM that could foster collaboration\nglobally and scale across offices in 35 countries and 15 manufacturing\nfacilities. Using Salesforce, Waters' employees can see insights and\nrecommendations based on previously closed deals and buying patterns to better\ntailor offerings to customers and shorten sales cycles. With Salesforce,\nWaters' sales and service teams will get a 360-degree view of each customer.\nSalesforce will also empower Waters' highly-specialized sales representatives\nto spend less time in their CRM and more time interacting with their\ncustomers.\n\n\"From the earliest days, Waters has always put a premium on our relationships\nwith customers. It is part of our culture instilled by Jim Waters himself, who\ncould often be seen working shoulder-to-shoulder with customers,\" said [Mike\nHarrington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-harrington-665823a/), Senior Vice\nPresident of Global Markets at Waters Corporation. \"Adoption of Salesforce's\nCRM solution is a modern expansion of our customer-centric culture. While\ncollaboration at the customers' benches will continue, we expect our new CRM\ncapabilities will deepen our understanding of and effectiveness in meeting the\nindividual needs of our customers worldwide.\"\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Talkdesk Zoom Integration Creates Customer-\nCentric Contact

However, this abundance of quality information is hindering\ncustomer decisions, as they report not only being overwhelmed by the amount of\ntrustworthy information, but often contradictory information among suppliers\nas well.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, which is overloaded with information, customers are\nstruggling mightily to make informed decisions about who and what to believe,\u201d\nsaid [Brent Adamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentadamson/), distinguished\nvice president in the Gartner Sales practice. \u201cCustomers are reaching an\ninformation saturation point, where each new idea reduces the value derived\nfrom information and turns sound decision making into \u2018best guesses\u2019 or \u2018gut\nfeeling\u2019 choices.\u201d\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Prodigo Solutions Teams up with Amazon\nBusiness for Ecommerce Integration](https://martechseries.com/sales-\nmarketing/b2b-commerce/prodigo-solutions-teams-amazon-business-ecommerce-\nintegration/)\n\nIn fact, when customers experience too much high-quality information,\ninformation that is contradictory and creates difficulty in making informed\npurchase decisions, they are 153% more likely to settle for a course of action\nsmaller and less disruptive than originally planned.\n\nGartner research found two customer sentiments that positively influence the\nlikelihood of a high-quality, low-regret deal: high confidence in the\ninformation they encountered and low skepticism of the seller. To that end,\ncustomers perceive sellers adopting one of three unique approaches to engaging\nthem with information \u2014 only one of which actually increases confidence and\nreduces skepticism:\n\n  * **Giving:** The giving approach follows the maxim that more is better. Giving follows from the belief that more information, especially at the customer\u2019s request, will move a deal forward.\n  * **Telling:** Telling is the preferred approach of individual experts on the sales force who rely on personal experience, knowledge and authority to address customers\u2019 needs. From a manager\u2019s perspective, a telling approach is the most autonomous.\n  * **Sense Making: \u201c** Sense making\u201d helps customers evaluate information so they are able to prioritize various sources of information, quantify trade-offs and reconcile conflicting information. Sense making simplifies customers\u2019 learning by helping them evaluate and prioritize relevant information, all while helping customers arrive at their own understanding.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Quiq Raises $12.5 Million to Transform the\nWay Companies Engage with Customers](https://martechseries.com/sales-\nmarketing/customer-experience-management/quiq-raises-12-5-million-transform-\nway-companies-engage-customers/)\n\nGartner research shows that 80% of the sellers who used the sense-making\napproach closed high-quality, low-regret deals.\n\n\u201cIn an era of too much good information, the sense-making approach engenders\ngreater customer confidence, reduces customer skepticism and, most\nimportantly, yields far greater likelihood of the customer purchasing an\nupgraded, premium offering from a supplier,\u201d added Mr. Adamson.\n\nAccording to Gartner research, sense making secures a commercial advantage\nthrough a series of unique, information-related behaviors:\n\n  * **Connect.** Diagnose customers\u2019 information needs and provide curated sources and tools to help customers feel they know all the relevant information.\n  * **Clarify.** Reduce the complexity of the information environment by filtering and processing information for customers.\n  * **Collaborate.** Help customers evaluate the quality of information and arrive at their own understanding of difficult issues.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, no matter what sales model a supplier employs, sense\nmaking must be at the foundation of your customer engagement strategy,\u201d said\nMr. Adamson. \u201cBuilding confidence, reducing skepticism and resolving customer\ninformation challenges is what sets the best apart from the rest and results\nin more consistent high-quality, low-regret deals.\u201d\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [3Cinteractive to

Despite the\ndecrease, this volume still equaled 163.5 million robocalls per day in April\nand 1,890 robocalls per second. These latest monthly figures come from\n_[YouMail](https://www.youmail.com/)_ , a free robocall blocking solution for\nmobile phones.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that April\u2019s robocall volume is heading in a positive\ndirection,\u201d said YouMail CEO [Alex\nQuilici](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexquilici/). \u201cBut the bad news is that\nthe total robocall volume so far this year is already over 20 billion calls,\nwhich is averaging over 5 billion robocalls per month.\u201d\n\nRecent attempts by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress to\naddress this vast consumer problem include the new SHAKEN/STIR rule for\nindustry stakeholders to implement policies to create caller ID\nauthentications. In addition, major carriers have rolled out new apps to block\nrobocalls due to growing consumer backlash. Yet despite such well-intentioned\nefforts, the problem continues to grow because it remains so simple and\ninexpensive to blast massive volumes of robocalls nationwide within a very\nshort period of time.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Cheetah Digital Strengthens EMEA Team With\nThree Executive Additions](https://martechseries.com/sales-\nmarketing/marketing-clouds/cheetah-digital-strengthens-emea-team-three-\nexecutive-additions/)\n\n**Robocalls Continue to Be Driven by Scams**\n\nScam robocalls continued their huge volumes, exceeding 2.25 billion calls in\nApril, making up nearly half of all U.S. robocalls.\n\n**Type of Robocall**\n\n|\n\n**Estimated April Robocalls**\n\n|\n\n**Percentage of April Robocalls**  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAlerts and Reminders\n\n|\n\n1.04 billion (+0 million)\n\n|\n\n21% (+1%)  \n  \nPayment Reminders\n\n|\n\n906 million (+14 million)\n\n|\n\n19% (+2%)  \n  \nTelemarketing\n\n|\n\n682 million (-124 million)\n\n|\n\n14% (-1%)  \n  \nScams\n\n|\n\n2.271 million (-6 million)\n\n|\n\n46% (-2%)  \n  \nTop 5 Robocall Scams in April were similar to March: Health/Health Insurance\nScams, Interest Rate Scams, Easy Money Scams, Student Loan Scams, and Search\nListing Scams. However, Health Insurance/Health related scams dropped by over\n30%, driven in large part by a decline of over 80 million Medical Brace Scam\ncalls, likely due to the shutdown of the scam by law enforcement during the\nmonth. In addition, Easy Money Scams were down by nearly 30% as well, though\nwith no clear enforcement actions related to the decline.\n\n**Top 5 Scam Robocalls of April 2019**\n\n**Rank**\n\n|\n\n**Type of Scam**\n\n|\n\n**Estimated April Robocalls**\n\n|\n\n**Summary of Scam**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n**1**\n\n|\n\nHealth/Health Insurance  \nScams\n\n|\n\n376.8m (-187.4 million)\n\n|\n\nIdentity theft/scam payments  \n  \n**2 (+1)**\n\n|\n\nInterest Rate Scams\n\n|\n\n188.8m (+16.5 million)\n\n|\n\nIdentity theft  \n  \n**3 (-1)**\n\n|\n\nEasy Money scams\n\n|\n\n163.5m (-66.2 million)\n\n|\n\nPay to make money/get job  \n  \n**4**\n\n|\n\nStudent Loan Scans\n\n|\n\n132.0m (+8.7 million)\n\n|\n\nIdentify theft/scam payments  \n  \n**5**\n\n|\n\nSearch Listing Scams\n\n|\n\n115.4m (-0.9 million)\n\n|\n\nFake search listing fees  \n  \n**\u201cWinners\u201d in April 2019**\n\nThe cities, area codes and states with the highest volumes of robocalls in\nApril were similar to January, February, and March.

YouMail recently won the American Business Awards Gold Stevie Award\nfor Technical Innovation of the Year, and the YouMail app was named the\nnation\u2019s best robocall-blocking solution in a competition organized by\nGeoffrey Fowler of the Washington Post.\n\nYouMail blocks unwanted robocallers by making sure the user\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t\nring, and then plays an out-of-service message that leads them to think they\ndialed an invalid number. YouMail identifies problematic numbers and robocalls\nusing a combination of its recently patented audio fingerprinting technology,\ncall patterns, and consumer feedback.\n\nYouMail provides the YouMail Robocall Index to estimate robocall volume across\nthe country and for specific area codes every month. This estimate is formed\nby extrapolating from the behavior of the billions of calls YouMail has\nhandled for its users, and these statistics are regularly cited by the FCC as\na definitive source for national data trends.\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Airtame Adds Power over Ethernet Product to\nTheir Services](https://martechseries.com/sales-\nmarketing/b2b-commerce/airtame-adds-power-ethernet-product-services/)\n\n__[Alex Quilici](https://martechseries.com/tag/alex-quilici/)[Federal\nCommunications Commission](https://martechseries.com/tag/federal-\ncommunications-commission/)[ID\nauthentications](https://martechseries.com/tag/id-authentications/)[Marketing\nTechnology](https://martechseries.com/tag/marketing-\ntechnology/)[News](https://martechseries.com/tag/news/)[YouMail](https://martechseries.com/tag/youmail/)\n\n[__**0**](https://martechseries.com/technology/4-9-billion-robocalls-april-\naccording-youmail-robocall-index/#respond \"Leave a comment on: \u201c4.9 Billion\nRobocalls In April, According to YouMail Robocall Index\u201d\") __**48**\n\n__**Share**\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Ftechnology%2F4-9-billion-\nrobocalls-april-according-youmail-robocall-\nindex%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/share?text=4.9+Billion+Robocalls+In+April%2C+According+to+YouMail+Robocall+Index&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Ftechnology%2F4-9-billion-\nrobocalls-april-according-youmail-robocall-\nindex%2F)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Ftechnology%2F4-9-billion-\nrobocalls-april-according-youmail-robocall-\nindex%2F&title=4.9+Billion+Robocalls+In+April%2C+According+to+YouMail+Robocall+Index)\n\n[ ](https://martechseries.com/author/prnewswire/ \"Browse Author Articles\")\n\n[PRNewswire](https://martechseries.com/author/prnewswire/)\n\n  * [__](http://www.prnewswire.com)\n\nPR Newswire, a Cision company, is the premier global provider of multimedia\nplatforms and distribution that marketers, corporate communicators,\nsustainability officers, public affairs and investor relations officers\nleverage to engage key audiences.

Our team advises suppliers and brands alike on understanding the\nmarket, capitalizing on emerging opportunities and developing growth\nstrategies. By working with both sides, we have unique insight into the pain\npoints and priorities of the entire\n[MarTech](https://martechseries.com/?s=martech) ecosystem, which allows us to\nform a holistic view of the marketing landscape and where it is heading.\n\n#### **How much has the Customer Data Platform landscape evolved in the last\ntwo years?**\n\nThere has been a significant proliferation of vendors calling themselves CDPs\nin the last few years. We\u2019ve seen providers from four main groups pivoting\nand/or expanding their capabilities to become CDPs: data and tag management\nproviders, data processing and identity providers, analytics-centric providers\nand application-centric providers (e.g. customer journey mapping tools,\npersonalization platforms, etc.). As a result, over 100 companies purport to\nbe a CDP today, up from 25 in 2016.\n\n#### **Could you tell us about the critical nature of your recent Marketing\nTechnology report on CDPs?**\n\nAs I mentioned, there are over 100 vendors promoting themselves as CDPs. But\nthere\u2019s no single definition that is both accepted by the industry and\naccurately describes all of these. Our report provides clarity to the market\nby narrowly defining the capabilities of true CDPs, especially in relation to\nthe capabilities of indirect, adjacent or alternative solutions.\n\nBy offering a standard definition of a CDP is, we\u2019re enabling marketers to be\nable to judge providers apples-to-apples\u2014as opposed to apples-to-oranges-to-\npears, as it can seem now. Then, the other, non-CDPs can be evaluated more\nappropriately as an add-on or complementary part of a marketing stack.\n\n#### **Which businesses are best prepared to adopt and leverage CDP\ntechnology? And, why not others?**\n\nGiven the robust data management capabilities of CDPs, we feel omnichannel\nmarketers are best prepared to leverage CDP technology. Businesses that have a\ncomplex data ecosystem with digital, mobile and physical presences are likely\nto get the most out of CDPs\u2019 ability to handle large volumes of data from\ndisparate sources at significant speed. Companies with less complicated data\nneeds may be better suited for traditional [Marketing\nAutomation](https://martechseries.com/?s=Marketing%20Automation) or campaign\nmanagement solutions.\n\n#### **What are the core capabilities of a true CDP?**\n\nWinterberry Group feels CDPs must be able to do the following: 1) ingest and\nintegrate customer data from multiple sources; 2) offer customer profile\nmanagement; 3) support \u201creal-time\u201d customer segmentation, and 4) make customer\ndata accessible to other systems.\n\n#### **How do CDPs unlock opportunities in CRM growth?**\n\nCDPs\u2019 main power is that they can provide and manage data in real-time to\npower omnichannel marketing. As brands increasingly engage with customers\nonline, they must deal with a fire-hose of digital data that can overwhelm\ntheir traditional processes and systems. By leveraging a universal and\nconsistent customer profile, CDPs allow marketers to combine data inputs from\nall channels and touchpoints (whether off or online) and to activate the data\n\u2014 enabling seamless omnichannel experiences.\n\n#### **Tell us more about the idea of building AI and Machine Learning\ncapabilities into the CDP technology.**\n\nWhile we see CDP platforms building AI and Machine Learning into their\nsystems, we do not see this as a core competency of the CDP. Winterberry Group\nbelieves that CDPs will build this capability for analytics and decisioning\npurposes, but that it should sit in the analytics layer of the [Marketing\nTechnology](https://martechseries.com/?s=Marketing%20Technology) stack and not\nthe data layer where the CDP belongs.\n\n#### **What are the major trends and predictions you see in the CDP space?**\n\nWinterberry Group anticipates that CDPs will continue to expand their\noffering, adding such capabilities as analytics, orchestration, engagement and\nattribution. However, we ultimately, don\u2019t believe standalone CDPs will\nsurvive long term. We predict that CDPs are likely to merge with other\nproviders\u2014either other standalone vendors or via acquisition by the marketing\nor data clouds\u2014in order to improve chances of success in the crowded market.\n\n#### **How do you see CDPs further disrupting the era of Marketing Technology\ngrowth?**\n\nMaximizing the value from a CDP requires a well-articulated data strategy and\nroadmap, but CDPs themselves are not a data strategy. While not all companies\ntoday will benefit from a CDP, we believe CDP capabilities will become crucial\nas the proliferation of media and data continues. As vendors of other\ntechnologies feel the heat from CDPs, it is likely to spur innovation across\nthe industry\u2014ultimately, benefiting suppliers that are quick to address\nmarketer concerns and easily integrate with other systems.\n\n**Thank you for answering all our questions!**\n\n  * About Michael\n  * About Winterberry Group\n\n#### About Michael\n\nMichael Harrison is Managing Director at Winterberry Group.

\"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\nLester Thornhill came to the United States from Trinidad to attend college.\nSasha Stephens immigrated from the former Soviet Union as a middle schooler.\nToday, Thornhill is the chief executive officer and Stephens the executive\nproject manager of Life's Abundance, Inc., a Florida-based company that makes\ndog food and a variety of other products for both humans and pets and was\nrecently named by Forbes Magazine to its list of \"The Best Small Companies of\n2019.\" They were in Dumas Friday to break ground on a new distribution and\ncustomer care center in the Dumas Business Park that, according to Dumas\nEconomic Development Corporation (DEDC) Executive Director Michael Running,\ncould have a 10-year economic benefit to the local area of $4,400,000.\n\nLife's Abundance has had a small, leased facility in Dumas for a few years.\n\"We were looking for a facility to serve customers in this area,\" said\nStephens. People order Life's Abundance products on the company website or\ncall customer care, and the company ships the products to the customer, or the\ncustomer can pick them up at the nearest warehouse. Stephens, who began in\ncustomer care before working her way up, said that they had looked at sites in\nDallas and elsewhere, but none had really worked for them. Then they saw an\nemail that Running had sent to companies touting the benefits of Dumas as a\ndestination for business. \"Everyone said, 'Where is Dumas?' \" After some phone\ncalls and a trip to see for themselves, the company moved into an existing\nfacility that Stephens said they thought would meet their needs for a while.\n\"This area has worked out for the shipping speed and cost.\" But \"sales\nincreased in Texas faster than we anticipated,\" she said, and the company\nfound itself rapidly running out of room.\n\nUnfortunately, there was not an existing facility in Dumas large enough to\nmeet the company's need for space. Amarillo was another story. Plus, Amarillo\nwould offer cheaper transportation costs than Dumas. Though Thornhill said he\nwanted the company to retain its presence in Dumas, the cost of building a new\nfacility would be over $2 million.\n\nAfter negotiations between the company and the DEDC, the DEDC agreed to, and\nthe Dumas City Commission approved, an incentive package to help defray some\nof the costs of Life's Abundance building a new facility in Dumas. The DEDC\nwill give the company a five acre parcel of land in the Dumas Business Park\nworth $150,000 and pay $20,000 in pre-engineering and other costs. The city\nwill provide an annual 65 percent reimbursement of the local sales tax money\ncollected by the firm for 10 years, not to exceed $500,000. The new facility\nwill be the distribution center for Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and much of\nthe rest of the center of the country. The customer care call center will be\ndouble the size of the old one. Thornhill and Stephens say there is a\npossibility that the company could expand its operations in Dumas into\npackaging in the future. Running says Life's Abundance makes a positive\ncontribution to the Dumas economy and is the type of company the city and area\nneed.\n\nBefore turning dirt Friday, Thornhill talked to the audience assembled for the\ngroundbreaking about the values of hard work, staying humble, and taking care\nof people that he said were shared by the company and the people of this area.\nHe said Life's Abundance was committed to being a good corporate citizen, and\nhe felt this area was a \"good fit\" for the company. \"I am looking forward to\nbeing here for decades to come,\" he said.\n\nLife's Abundance started in a loft above a garage, said Thornhill. He had been\nout of college a few years when he met Denis and Carol Berardi in the late\n1990's. They had been in the business world for several years, and they were\ninterested in forming a company that would retain the things they liked about\nthat world while eliminating those they didn't. They wanted to start a\ndifferent kind of company. \"They had a crazy idea to have a company that helps\npeople and pets at the same time,\" said Thornhill. He was willing to get on\nboard. By 2008, he was named president and chief executive officer. Thornhill\nsays the company has been able to grow steadily (20 percent last year) while\nmaintaining a commitment to the values it was founded on. \"We are 100 percent\nemployee owned, so the employees get 100 percent of the company's success,\" he\nsaid.\n\nLife's Abundance products have never been recalled by the Food and Drug\nAdministration. Thornhill points out that when the FDA recently recommended to\npet food manufacturers that they begin adding taurine to their food to help\nprevent heart problems in pets, Life's Abundance didn't have to bother.\nTaurine had been in the company's formulation from the beginning. \"I think\nwhat differentiates us from other companies is that we are private. Our\npurpose is improving the health and wellness of families. Our purpose is not\nmaking money. We make money, but it is just a barometer of how many families\nwe help. The more families we help, the more profit we make. That basically\nallows us to have a formulation philosophy that says if it is good for the\npet, we are going to do it. If we were really motivated by profit, there are a\nlot of things we do that are very, very stupid.

With\npowerful integrations ranging from CRMs to marketing automation platforms,\nSeismic is the most integrated sales enablement platform in the market with\nthe widest array of integration use cases.\n\n\u201cFor enterprises to truly align their sales and marketing teams today, their\ntechnologies need to be aligned as well. No other sales enablement platform on\nthe market today offers that level of powerful technology integration to the\nextent that Seismic does,\u201d said [Doug\nWinter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-winter), co-founder and CEO, Seismic.\n\u201cWith Seismic as the connector between the tools sales and marketing teams use\nevery day, the result is greater sales productivity, more effective marketing\ninitiatives, and a greater return on technology spend.\u201d\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [TIBCO Announces Enhanced Mashery API\nManagement Solution with Cloud-Native\nDesign](https://martechseries.com/analytics/tibco-announces-enhanced-mashery-\napi-management-solution-cloud-native-design/ \"View TIBCO Announces Enhanced\nMashery API Management Solution with Cloud-Native Design\")\n\nMore than 90 percent of customers take advantage of Seismic\u2019s integration\ncapabilities, which include:\n\n  * Customer relationship management: Salesforce CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, Sugar CRM, Siebel, CRM\n  * Marketing automation: Marketo, Oracle Eloqua, Salesforce Marketing Cloud\n  * Data vendors: FactSet, Morningstar, Google AdWords\n  * Sales readiness: Brainshark, MindTickle\n  * Content management systems: Box, DropBox, OneDrive, Google Drive\n  * Email clients: Microsoft Outlook, Gmail\n  * Web content management: Sitecore, Adobe AEM\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [VERB Announces The Addition of Shopify For\nIn-Video Product Purchasing](https://martechseries.com/sales-\nmarketing/crm/verb-announces-addition-shopify-video-product-purchasing/ \"View\nVERB Announces The Addition of Shopify For In-Video Product Purchasing\")\n\nSeismic offers unparalleled capabilities in syncing content between integrated\ntechnologies to ensure marketers and sellers have access to the right\nmaterials and information wherever they work. Unique to the sales enablement\nmarket, however, is the level to which Seismic incorporates data and\nfunctionality from integrated technologies to help sellers be more productive.\n__ Specific examples of this include:\n\n  * Seismic\u2019s dynamic content assembly technology LiveDocs leverages third-party data from sources ranging from financial data sources such as FactSet and Morningstar to CPQ systems and market intelligence platforms to help sellers automatically personalize pitch decks, quarterly reviews, and other customer-facing content with the information most pertinent to each unique customer.\n  * Seismic\u2019s integration with marketing automation tools such as Marketo and Oracle Eloqua allow marketers to see for the first time page-by-page content and engagement data at every stage of the buyer\u2019s journey, resulting in unprecedented insights into campaign performance, personalization, and lead scoring.\n  * Seismic\u2019s predictive content functionality, available within CRMs such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, surfaces content to sellers that is proven most likely to engage each unique opportunity through integrations with a wide array of technologies housing customer data. This includes marketing automation platforms and commercial analytics providers such as Dun & Bradstreet. More than 300 enterprises are currently using Seismic\u2019s Salesforce integration.\n\n\u201cSeismic\u2019s Salesforce integration is a great resource for our sales and\nmarketing teams,\u201d said [Sara\nCabral](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarabayliscabral/), Product Operations\nManager at Intapp. \u201cBy automatically providing our sales teams with the exact\ncontent they need to move deals forward right within their Salesforce\ninterface, not only have we seen a noted increase in sales productivity, but\nSalesforce adoption has increased, increasing the ROI of that tool as well.\u201d\n\n**_Marketing Technology News:_** [Adobe Target and Adobe Sensei Add New\nDimensions to Personalization in

Multiplayer Games on Smartphones and Tablets Took Center Stage for the\nFirst Time**_\n\nLeading mobile app data and insights company [App\nAnnie](http://www.appannie.com) and [International Data\nCorporation](https://www.idc.com/) (IDC), the premier provider of technology\nmarket intelligence services, unveiled a special joint report entitled,\n\"Gaming Spotlight, 2017 Review.\" The report analyzes the mobile games market\nin 2017 from several vantage points and puts it in a broader, global gaming\nindustry context\n\nThe report features three main themes: mobile gaming's relatively large scale\nand faster growth rate in terms of direct consumer spending compared to home\ngame consoles and PC/Mac gaming; the ascendance of live player vs. player\n(PvP) or co-op multiplayer games to the top of the grossing charts last year;\nand Asia-Pacific's ongoing rise to dominance not just in terms of spending\nbut, increasingly, in-game origination and gameplay innovation.\n\n_**Also Read:**_[Brainshark Unveils Sales Training Enhancements to Strengthen\nLearning Paths](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/sales-\nenablement/brainshark-unveils-sales-training-enhancements-to-strengthen-\nlearning-paths/ \"View Brainshark Unveils Sales Training Enhancements to\nStrengthen Learning Paths\")\n\nDirect spending on mobile games exceeded the combined spending total on a home\nconsole, PC/Mac, and handheld console games by more than one third in 2017, up\nfrom a single-digit margin by the same measure in 2016. Games also generated\nnearly 80% of total worldwide consumer spend for combined iOS and Google Play\nwhile accounting for roughly 35% of worldwide downloads.\n\n\"Mobile gaming's lead widened globally in 2017; mobile game spending was 2.3x\nPC gaming and 3.6x game consoles last year. With billions of mobile devices in\nthe world, apps are the mass market gaming platform for casual and serious\ngamers, enabling them to play whenever and wherever they want to,\" said[\nDanielle Levitas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlevitas/), SVP Research,[ App\nAnnie](https://martechseries.com/mobile/app-annie-announces-annual-list-\ntop-52-highest-earning-publishers-2017/).\n\nThe top two grossing games worldwide on both iOS and Google Play in 2017\nfeatured live PvP gameplay, demonstrating that hardcore-leaning multiplayer\nelements aren't just possible on mobile devices, but have already proven\npopular and lucrative. The ascent of titles like Honour of Kings (published by\nTencent and known as Arena of Valor in Western markets), Lineage 2 Revolution\n(Netmarble), Fantasy Westward Journey (NetEase), and Lineage M (NCSOFT) to the\ntop of the mobile grossing charts shows that live multiplayer games are an\nimportant trend in gaming that has clear esports implications. 2017 appears to\nhave been the first year that three different live PvP titles took the top-\ngrossing slot on iOS, Google Play, and handheld game consoles (Pok\u00e9mon Sun /\nPok\u00e9mon Moon, published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo for Nintendo\n3DS/2DS, was the top-grossing handheld title last year, and features live PvP\nbattles).\n\n_**Also Read:**_[ App Annie Strengthens Executive Team Amid Rapid Company\nGrowth and Market Expansion](https://martechseries.com/mobile/app-annie-\nstrengthens-executive-team-amid-rapid-company-growth-and-market-expansion/\n\"View App Annie Strengthens Executive Team Amid Rapid Company Growth and\nMarket Expansion\")\n\nAn IDC survey of U.S. gamers from 3Q 2017 showed that a lower share of\nsmartphone and handheld console gamers played live PvP or co-op titles (34%)\nthan did PC/Mac and home console gamers (over 44%), but this gap also narrowed\nrelative to a similar survey from 3Q 2016. Live PvP or co-op gamers on\nsmartphones and handheld consoles, the same 3Q 2017 survey showed, skewed\nyounger and male compared to the balance of smartphone and handheld gamers\nthat didn't play such games. Live PvP or co-op gamers in the U.S. were more\nlikely to have spent money on a smartphone or handheld console game in 3Q\n2017, moreover, and were more likely to play associated titles for at least\nfive hours a week.\n\n\"Live multiplayer gaming on smartphones and tablets took a big step forward in\n2017. Although titles such as Clash Royale, ROBLOX, and Hearthstone: Heroes of\nWarcraft have been popular in Western markets for some time, it's now clear\nthat publishers from Asia-Pacific not only have an 'answer' to these titles,\nbut upped the ante last year not just in scale but, arguably, in the\nsophistication of live PvP and co-op gameplay,\" said [Lewis\nWard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-ward-77b7696/), Research Director\nGaming and AR/VR, IDC.\n\n_**Recommended Read:**_[ App Annie: Netflix and iQIYI Lead APAC Revenue\nRanking in Online Video Apps in H1 2017](https://martechseries.com/video/app-\nannie-netflix-iqiyi-lead-apac-revenue-ranking-online-video-apps-h1-2017/ \"View\nApp Annie: Netflix and iQIYI Lead APAC Revenue Ranking in Online Video Apps in\nH1 2017\")\n\n__[App Annie](https://martechseries.com/tag/app-annie/)[audience\ndata](https://martechseries.com/tag/audience-data/)[Console\nGaming](https://martechseries.com/tag/console-\ngaming/)[IDC](https://martechseries.com/tag/idc/)[International Data\nCorporation](https://martechseries.com/tag/international-data-\ncorporation/)[Mobile gaming](https://martechseries.com/tag/mobile-\ngaming/)[News](https://martechseries.com/tag/news/)[Nintendo](https://martechseries.com/tag/nintendo/)[Pokemon](https://martechseries.com/tag/pokemon/)[Sales\nEnablement](https://martechseries.com/tag/sales-enablement/)\n\n[__**0**](https://martechseries.com/analytics/audience-data/app-annie-and-idc-\nreport-finds-spending-on-mobile-games-topped-the-combined-total-of-home-\nconsole-pc-and-handheld-console-games-in-2017/#respond \"Leave a comment on:\n\u201cApp Annie and IDC Report Finds Spending on Mobile Games Topped the Combined\nTotal of Home Console, PC and Handheld Console Games in 2017\u201d\") __**40**\n\n__**Share**\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fanalytics%2Faudience-\ndata%2Fapp-annie-and-idc-report-finds-spending-on-mobile-games-topped-the-\ncombined-total-of-home-console-pc-and-handheld-console-games-\nin-2017%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/share?text=App+Annie+and+IDC+Report+Finds+Spending+on+Mobile+Games+Topped+the+Combined+Total+of+Home+Console%2C+PC+and+Handheld+Console+Games+in+2017&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fanalytics%2Faudience-\ndata%2Fapp-annie-and-idc-report-finds-spending-on-mobile-games-topped-the-\ncombined-total-of-home-console-pc-and-handheld-console-games-\nin-2017%2F)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fanalytics%2Faudience-\ndata%2Fapp-annie-and-idc-report-finds-spending-on-mobile-games-topped-the-\ncombined-total-of-home-console-pc-and-handheld-console-games-\nin-2017%2F&title=App+Annie+and+IDC+Report+Finds+Spending+on+Mobile+Games+Topped+the+Combined+Total+of+Home+Console%2C+PC+and+Handheld+Console+Games+in+2017)\n\n[ ](https://martechseries.com/author/prnewswire/ \"Browse Author Articles\")\n\n[PRNewswire](https://martechseries.com/author/prnewswire/)\n\n  * [__](http://www.prnewswire.com)\n\nPR Newswire, a Cision company, is the premier global provider of multimedia\nplatforms and distribution that marketers, corporate communicators,\nsustainability officers, public affairs and investor relations officers\nleverage to engage key audiences.

What inspired you to be\npart of an enterprise content services company?  \n**I\u2019ve spent my entire career working for software companies that focus on\nbuilding applications that foster collaboration, communication and the\nautomation of business processes to better serve customers. I've been at\nAlfresco for three years now, and it\u2019s been exciting to watch the enterprise\ncontent services market evolve and see the importance of content grow over\ntime. There is a lot of value that can be extracted from information that was\npreviously \u201clocked away,\u201d and now we can help people access the information\nthey need when and where they need it, instead of spending countless hours\nsearching for it.\n\n**MTS: As a pioneer in content services, how does Alfresco enable B2B\ncompanies to deliver truly personalized customer experience and engagement?  \n**Alfresco has been a disruptor in the content management market and\nrecognized as an innovator since our inception. Information has to be easy to\nfind and integrated into the way people work, not the other way around. So\nthat\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on \u2013 making it as easy as possible for people to\naccess, consume and share information across the enterprise, as well as\nensuring that development teams can create applications on top of the Alfresco\nplatform. Speed and responsiveness are the new metrics of successful\ncompanies, combined with the ability to seamlessly access information and arm\npeople with the information that will empower them to perform the tasks in\nfront of them and help them determine what they need to do.\n\n**MTS: How do you bring collaboration to the core of digital business\nworkflow?  \n**You put people in the center. You have to [apply design\nthinking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfresco/2017/03/10/capital-one-\nembraces-design-thinking/#4b937cb530e7) and prototype with your users and\ncontinuously iterate. There is a great article featuring one of our customers,\nCapital One, which describes how they reimagined the customer onboarding\nprocess and ensured that everyone who is part of the process can participate\nwithout friction. They also removed useless steps and reduced interactions by\naround 70%. We talk about \u201cdigital business flow\u201d as a way to design for the\neasy movement of information throughout an organization \u2013 helping people\nconnect with structured and unstructured information seamlessly. I think it\u2019s\nan inspiring concept.\n\n**MTS: What are the major challenges for companies to become truly data-\nenabled organizations without putting additional pressure on the existing IT\ninfrastructure?  \n**We are awash with data, and there\u2019s only going to be more and more data that\ncan be collected. Our first step to becoming more data-driven at Alfresco was\nto establish a data governance team to harmonize across our data sets, agree\non the source of truth and prioritize what information we needed to capture to\nefficiently run our business. Good data leads to good decisions, so you need\nto focus first on data quality, then you can determine what you want to\nanalyze. We have customers, such as FINRA, [which are\nleveraging](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/finra/) cloud\nproviders like Amazon Web Services to process data sets, using computing\npower, they never could before. They are managing critical data at an\nimpressive scale.\n\n**MTS: How do you see new data governance policies, brand safety regulations\nand anti-ad fraud campaigns impacting the world of digital media?  \n**The General Data Protection Regulation\n[(GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) is\nthe largest directive I\u2019m aware of in the past decade that will make\norganizations seriously examine their internal policies. So far, cybersecurity\nconcerns have dominated expert discussions, but businesses cannot ignore\nissues that surround the right to erasure, data portability, and governance.\nGDPR goes beyond the mere protection of data from security risks; it focuses,\nequally heavily, on the appropriate use of it within organizations. As the\nimplementation deadline of May 2018 looms closer, companies need effective\n[Information Governance](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/governance-\nservices-rm) and to establish [business\nprocesses](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/process-services-bpm) to manage\nrisk and avoid non-compliance \u2013 simply and efficiently. Someone will be the\nfirst to fail, and no one wants to be that poster child.\n\n**MTS: What startups are you watching/keen on right now?  \n**[Conversica](https://martechseries.com/predictive-ai/intelligent-\nassistants/conversica-voted-best-salesforce-app-dreamforce-17/) is really\ninteresting and, in my view, the first practical use of an artificial\nintelligence application within marketing. They use chatbots to engage early-\nstage leads or to follow up on a volume of leads all at once. It works like a\n\u201chuman sales assistant,\u201d reaching out and trying to engage customers in a\n\u201cconversation.\u201d I also advise a company called Folloze. They provide new and\nbetter ways to empower salespeople to share high-quality content with\nprospects in an engaging way \u2013 while still keeping marketing as a key\nparticipant in the process and ultimately making account-based engagement more\npersonalized, at scale.\n\n**Also Read:** [**Interview with Carl Landers, CMO,\nConversica**](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/interviews/interview-\ncarl-landers-svp-marketing-cmo-conversica/)\n\n**MTS: What tools does your marketing stack consist of in 2017? _  \n_** I\u2019ll focus on the top five technologies that I couldn\u2019t live without.\n[Marketo](https://martechseries.com/tag/marketo/) and\n[Salesforce](https://martechseries.com/tag/salesforce/) are the foundation of\nour stack. We use [Demandbase](https://martechseries.com/tag/demandbase/) for\nour [account-based marketing](https://martechseries.com/category/sales-\nmarketing/account-based-marketing/) efforts, and, since we\u2019re an open source\ncompany, we use Drupal for our website, connected with Google Analytics. We're\ncurrently looking at how to add a sales prospecting tool, like an Outreach or\nSalesLoft, for our outbound prospecting efforts.\n\n**Also Read:** [**TechBytes with Christopher Golec, CEO,\nDemandbase**](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/tech-bytes/techbytes-\nchristopher-golec-ceo-demandbase/)\n\n**MTS: Would you tell us about your standout digital campaign?  \n**Our most successful program is an insurance campaign that is in flight right\nnow. We\u2019re very proud to have many top insurance companies select Alfresco as\ntheir modern, cloud-native, process and content platform. So, we are targeting\nother property and casualty companies to share those success stories with. Our\nstrategy is to surround, or swarm, these customers, identifying 100+ people in\na target account. Our results with this approach have far outpaced successes\nwe\u2019ve seen in other campaigns.\n\nI believe the success is all about the quality of the contact data, the\nrelevance of our story, and the coordination between the marketing, SDR and\nsales teams. Once we launch a swarm, we can see where we have \u201cheat.\u201d If we've\nsent something relevant to 100 people on that account and ten people respond,\nwe know there is interest and continue to go after it even faster.\n\n**MTS: How do you prepare for an AI-centric world as a marketing leader?  \n**I like to be on the edge of innovation, but I'm also pragmatic. I think we\nneed to prove the AI model a bit more to determine where it adds value.\nCurrently, I\u2019m in research and \u201cwait and see\u201d mode, listening to my peers and\nseeing where they notice success. It goes back to quality data, the quality of\nthe questions, setting good hypotheses, and your ability to get good analysts\nto help you manage and analyze the data and then figure out how to apply it to\nAI scenarios. As it stands today, we're a couple of years out from AI being a\ntrue, integrated part of the common martech stack.\n\n> _**This is How I Work**_\n\n**MTS: One word that best describes how you work.  \n**Passionately!\n\n**MTS: What apps/software/tools can\u2019t you live without?  \n**My mobile phone, mostly for texting to get quick answers, but I constantly\nhave to remind people that the phone is actually used for making calls!
