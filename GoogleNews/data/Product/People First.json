its people.\n\nBy: [Daniel Teo](https://hrmasia.com/author/daniel/ \"Posts by Daniel Teo\") |\nMarch 19, 2020\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) | [Digital\nTransformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-transformation/) |\n[Employee Experience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-\nexperience/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/) | [Learning and\nDevelopment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/learning-development/) |\n[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/) | [Professional\nDevelopment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/professional-development/) |\n[Restructuring](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/restructuring/) |\n[Singapore](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/singapore/) | [Southeast\nAsia](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/asean/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HRM03869.jpg)\n\nHow many people can say that they have free beer at work? The employees at\nAsia Pacific Breweries (APB) Singapore certainly can. But it\u2019s not just the\nfree beer after office hours at its famous Tiger Tavern that is helping the\ncompany engage its people, but the digital and people-first culture that flows\nthrough the only commercial brewery in Singapore.\n\nOwned by The HEINEKEN Company, APB Singapore was founded as Malayan Breweries\nLimited (MBL) in 1931. And for an organisation that has gone through nearly 90\nyears of changes, one thing remains at the heart of the company \u2013 its people.\nHaving said that, there\u2019s no doubt what needed to be changed - that is to\ndigitalise and leverage on technology to ensure the company keeps pace and\nstays relevant, both commercially and in its people strategy.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/HRM03855-250x141.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/HRM03855.jpg)\n\nShaun Ee, Human Resources (HR) Director of APB Singapore at the Tiger Tavern.\n\nDriving the digital transformation at a company with such a long history and\ngetting its employees on board is always going to be a challenge. And the\nsecret behind APB Singapore\u2019s success is the ability to keep its people at its\ncore in their digital transformation journey.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to HRM Asia over a beer (disclaimer: zero-alcohol), Shaun\nEe, Human Resources (HR) Director of APB Singapore said, \u201cPeople are at the\nheart of the company. So any digital solutions that we embark on must have a\npurpose to ensure that there is more productivity at work and the people are\nable to do their jobs with an eye on the future as we move towards a digital\nera in which we continue to stay relevant.\u201d\n\n**Work safety through technology**\n\n180 of its 420 employees (43%) are located at its supply chain site, where its\nbrewing, packaging, lab, warehouse and logistics departments are located. And\nwith work safety of the utmost importance and priority for the company, it\ncomes as no surprise that it is the first thing in the company\u2019s mind when\nimplementing technology in its processes.\n\n\u201cWe place strong emphasis on workforce development to build a connected\nbrewery powered by digital innovation,\u201d Ee said.\n\n\u201cWe leverage the advancement in smart technology to transform our workforce,\nenhance productivity, and continuously build a safe and conducive working\nenvironment for our workers.\u201d\n\nGiven the risk that workers face at the supply chain site where they are\nrequired to scale up tall distillery tanks for inspections, cleaning and even\nto put out fire, the company has leveraged on technologies such as virtual\nreality, augmented reality and drone technology to make these processes safer\nand more effective.\n\n**Virtual Reality:**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VR-\nfirefighting-700x335.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VR-\nfirefighting.jpg)\n\nImagine having to train your workers to put out a fire or an emergency with\nthe use of real fire. Fortunately, that\u2019s a thing of the past at APB\nSingapore, which now adopts Virtual Reality (VR) as a way of immersive safety\ntrainings for its workers.\n\nThis helps to enhance its workforce\u2019s readiness as VR incorporates ultra-\nrealistic and multi-angle immersive virtual environment that is of close\nreplica of an operating plant, and trains workers to work safely at height and\nrespond quickly and appropriately to fire situations. The technology enables\neffective learning to take place in a safe and controlled environment, and\nbuilds workers\u2019 confidence in tackling tricky scenarios should they arise in\nreal life.\n\n**Augmented Reality:**\n\nThe company incorporated Augmented Reality (AR) to make its safety trainings\nmore interactive. Through AR, employees learn the all-important Lockout-Tagout\n(LOTO) procedure through superimposed guided procedural information on real\nobjects with augmented reality glasses. The training comprises a step by step,\nsafe and consistent LOTO procedure that will guide the staff to ensuring that\ndangerous machines are shut off safety and won\u2019t be accidentally restarted.\n\n**Drone Technology:**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Drone-\ninspection-250x339.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Drone-\ninspection.jpg)\n\nWorkers used to climb up the distillery tanks to do inspections and cleaning.\nNot anymore. They now deploy drones to high-risk confined spaces to aid with\nroutine examinations of the tanks. Drone inspection technology allows workers\nto conduct tank inspections by flying drones into GPS denied and tight areas\nthat were traditionally inaccessible. The drone inspection technology has\nreduced high-risk work while allowing them to carry out inspections\nefficiently and effectively.\n\n**Solving HR problems, digitally**\n\nDespite the rapid and radical growth of technology in today\u2019s digital age,\nthere remains a resistance to digitalisation and technology by the HR industry\nparticularly in this region and among older companies who are reluctant to\nmove out of their traditional HR function.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case at APB Singapore. In fact, its HR team has been\ninstrumental in championing and driving the digital transformation at the\ncompany as well as engaging their employees through it.\n\n\u201cAs Singapore\u2019s leading brewery, we are continuously exploring new ways on how\ndigitalisation can enhance the capabilities, knowledge and skillsets of our\nworkforce,\u201d Ee explained.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we also want to ensure that we are a great place to work\nand constantly take the time to assess our workplace and determine where we\ncan improve the culture.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways that helped propel the company\u2019s drive towards digitalisation\nis the first ever HEINEKEN HR Brewhouse held late last year in Singapore,\nwhere HR tech players around the world converged to showcase and propose tech\ninnovations that help solve HR challenges they face. In fact, one of the four\nwinning ideas was piloted by APB Singapore to boost internal employee\nengagement.\n\nThe company has also created a HR information system called MyHR which\nencapsulates everything about employees\u2019 life cycle and data - from\nonboarding, to performance, training, appraisal, career aspiration and even\nleave application.\n\n**Training by \u2018swiping\u2019**\n\nOne of the challenges that HR faces today is not just in implementing\ntechnology, but getting its people on board \u2013 both young and old - and\nequipping them with the digital skills in order to utilise it effectively and\nimprove their productivity.\n\nBut APB Singapore has managed to get its employees to adopt its digital\nsolutions. For example, even its trainings have been digitalised. Gone are the\ndays of paper manuals. Employees can now \u2018swipe\u2019 through training manuals on\ntheir devices anywhere and anytime through its training app SwipeGuide, which\nallows the company to create, publish, and share interactive step-by-step\ninstructions.\n\n\u201cWe want our employees to walk the digital journey with us. That\u2019s why we have\ndigitalised our training sessions to get them on board the digital solutions.\nAnd they are keen on it because they know it\u2019s not just APB Singapore who is\ngoing through digitalisation, but companies all around the world,\u201d Ee\ncontinued.\n\n\u201cThey are able to learn something new but in a familiar and convenient way\nthrough their devices. And it\u2019s not just the younger employees who have come\non board. Our older employees who have been with us for 30 to 40 years are\npicking up these digital skills and these have helped them in their work at\nthe brewery such as operating the drones.\u201d\n\n**HR at the heart of the business**\n\nHR has long been seen as a function rather than a business partner. And that\nhas prevented HR from playing a strategic role and implementing changes to\nhelp move their companies and employees forward in this digital age.\n\nBut the same cannot be said at APB Singapore, where HR and its people are at\nthe heart of the company. And that has empowered Ee and his team to carry out\nthe digital transformation and more importantly, be a strategic partner to the\nbusiness.\n\n\u201cAs HR our core mission is to partner the business as much as we can. What\u2019s\nimportant is knowing how the business works as we want to be at heart of the\nbusiness,\u201d Ee explained.\n\n\u201cWe need to be aware of the business direction, strategy and performance. Most\nimportantly, we cannot forget that people are at the heart of all that we do.\nAnd that\u2019s the number one priority for us.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that the people agenda walks alongside the business agenda.\nAnd if you are able to put the two together, you will achieve the ultimate\nvision of HR being a business partner to the company.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fbrewing-\nup-a-digital-and-people-first-culture-at-asia-pacific-breweries-singapore%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Brewing+up+a+digital+and+people-\nfirst+culture+at+APB+Singapore&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fbrewing-up-a-\ndigital-and-people-first-culture-at-asia-pacific-breweries-\nsingapore%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fbrewing-\nup-a-digital-and-people-first-culture-at-asia-pacific-breweries-singapore%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Cultivating an amazing culture\nempowers Ultimate to recruit and retain amazing people, who in turn believe in\nthe company's mission and support it through daily hard work developing strong\nhuman capital management solutions and services.\n\n\"In many ways, it's a cyclical relationship -- culture drives our people and\nour people drive our culture, and our success,\" Neal says. \"We take care of\nour people and our people take care of our customers. We work together to put\npeople first and help other businesses do the same.\"\n\nUltimate ranked #6 of 500 companies representing a variety of industries --\nfrom technology, healthcare and retail to hospitality, construction and\nfinance -- with thousands of employees working across the United States.\nForbes added the diversity vertical to its reporting coverage in response to\nthe fact the topic of diversity and inclusion has gained greater importance in\nthe business world. This year marks its third annual list.\n\nUltimate is one of the few companies in the United States to offer 100%\nemployer-paid healthcare premiums for employees and their families, and\nextended medical coverage in Canada. Employees have access to a range of\ncomprehensive benefits and programs, \"each deliberately designed to best serve\nour employees at every stage of their lives and careers,\" Neal explains.\n\nSome highlights that really make an impact on employees include coverage for\nIVF treatments, $10,000 in adoption assistance, coverage for gender\nreassignment surgery and a 45% dollar-for-dollar company match on all\nretirement contributions, with no cap, up to federal limits. Salaried\nemployees receive unlimited PTO and hourly employees get at least 15 days a\nyear.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n\"We encourage our people to take the time they need throughout the year to\nrelax, recharge and enjoy personal interests,\" Neal says. \"We're extremely\nproud, excited and moved when we hear from our employees about how these\nbenefits have been life-changing for them, and just as often their families.\"\n\nLast year, Ultimate launched its companywide \"U Belong\" program that builds\nupon the foundations and principles of Ultimate's longstanding diversity and\ninclusion practices to develop a comprehensive, supportive program dedicated\nto ensuring all employees are comfortable bringing their whole, authentic\nselves to work.\n\nUltimate includes diversity and inclusion training -- such as workshops on\ncreating environments of safety and trust, recognizing and avoiding\nunconscious biases in the workplace and embracing creative differences for\nbetter collaboration and innovation -- as part of its LeadUS development\nprogram for current and future leaders.\n\nIt's also a priority at Ultimate to support its peoples' work in the\ncommunity, and employees are able to use three paid service days per year to\nhelp out at nonprofit organizations or with charitable causes important to\nthem.\n\n\"We want our benefits to personally serve all our employees,\" Neal says. \"We\ncontinuously ask our people what more they'd like to see and how we can\ncontinue to improve upon on to provide the most extensive, supportive range of\nbenefits of all companies -- not just in technology, but across industries.\"\n\nNeal says when you're part of a culture and living it daily, it's easy to\nbelieve you're operating using the best methods. Being ranked highly by Forbes\nvalidates the path Ultimate is on -- \"Think about how much people trust and\nvalue Yelp reviews over company ad campaigns,\" she adds -- and reflects the\nfact they are a role model for other companies.\n\nNeal, who has been with Ultimate since 2019, says she followed the company\nlong before joining, attracted by its approach to its employees.\n\n\"What really stands out to me is the way Ultimate's core values and mission\nhasn't changed from day one,\" she explains. \"Founder Scott Scherr. started the\ncompany with a commitment to his people, and that commitment has continued,\nthrough good and bad times. Ultimate's people and the company as a whole have\nprospered.\"\n\nWhat Ultimate has been doing all along -- treating its people as the most\nimportant asset to a successful business and caring for them like family -- is\nnow more mainstream, with company leaders coming alive to the value of putting\ntheir employees' interest at the top of the priority list. Its award-winning\n\"People First\" culture has made it one of the most admired companies across\nindustries and Neal, now as part of the team, aims to \"take Ultimate into the\nfuture and bring this award-winning culture to even greater levels.\"\n\n\"We're always looking at ways to make our benefits offerings even better for\nour people and to serve their evolving needs and expectations,\" she says,\nadding while she can't get into specifics there are currently great new\nbenefit offerings being discussed.\n\nUltimate is also expanding its Communities of Interest employee-resource\ngroups, which currently include PRIDEUS for the company's LGBT+ community,\nWomen in Leadership and Women in Technology, UltiVETS for veterans and active\nservice members and UltiHOPE for cancer patients, survivors and caregivers.\n\n\"Our approach going forward will be the same as it's always been -- putting\npeople first and always doing the right thing for our people,\" Neal says.\n\"We're excited for what the future holds, and we think our employees -- both\ncurrent and future -- will be excited too.\"\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Covid-19 self-employed relief scheme extended to those with some employment income, higher property annual value -

The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (Sirs) will be\nextended to include self-employed people who also earn a small income from\nemployment as well as those who live in properties with an annual value of up\nto $21,000.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced these enhancements in\nParliament on Monday (April 6) as part of a third Budget to help tide\nSingaporeans through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSirs, which was first announced on March 26, [will disburse $9,000 in cash\nover nine months to eligible self-employed\npeople](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/coronavirus-88000-eligible-\nself-employed-to-receive-9000-cash-payout-this-year). But some felt the\ncriteria were too stringent.\n\nIt previously excluded those living in properties with an annual value of more\nthan $13,000 and those who earned any income as employees.\n\nMr Heng on Monday said he would extend the scheme to automatically include\nself-employed people who also earn a small income from employment work.\n\nManpower Minister Josephine Teo later elaborated that this amount would be\ncapped at $2,300 per month, which is the current Workfare income ceiling.\n\nMr Heng would also raise the annual value threshold from $13,000 to $21,000.\nThis will include most condominiums outside prime areas and some other private\nproperties.\n\nWith these enhancements, about 100,000 self-employed people will be eligible\nfor the scheme - up from 88,000 previously - and will receive three quarterly\ncash payouts of $3,000 in May, July and October this year.\n\nOther criteria, such as the rule that the self-employed person and their\nspouse together must not own two or more properties, and that the spouse's\nassessable income must not exceed $70,000, will not change.\n\nMr Heng said that the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has stepped up to\nhelp the Ministry of Manpower administer the [applications and appeals for\nSirs](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mom-will-look-into-appeals-of-\nself-employed-who-do-not-automatically-qualify-for-covid-19).\n\nHe added that during the circuit breaker period, which will last a month from\nTuesday, more self-employed people will see a further drop in income.\n\n![](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2020/04/06/solidarity-\nbudget-v2.png)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [All adult Singaporeans to receive one-off $600 Solidarity Payment in\nApril to cope with Covid-19](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/all-adult-\nsingaporeans-to-receive-one-off-600-solidarity-payment-in-april)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Govt to increase risk share on loans to 90 per cent to ensure credit\naccess for firms during Covid-19 crisis: DPM\nHeng](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/government-to-increase-risk-share-\non-loans-to-90-per-cent-to-ensure-credit-access-for-firms)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [All firms to get 75% wage subsidy for local employees and foreign worker\nlevy waived for April](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/employers-in-all-\nsectors-to-get-75-wage-subsidy-for-local-employees-in-april-dpm-heng)\n\nMr Heng, who is also the Finance Minister, said the move to enhance Sirs\nfollows feedback from self-employed people who have done some employment work\nto supplement their incomes or who have bought an executive condominium some\nyears ago.\n\n\"Their income is now severely affected by the pandemic, and they still have to\nsupport multiple family members' daily needs or medical bills.\"\n\nHe said: \"This is the first time that we are providing direct cash support to\nself-employed persons on such a large scale.

30 March 2020: Experts who can talk on coronavirus and the impact\non tourism are crawling out of the woodwork claiming they have seen the light\nthat eluded the rest of us.\n\nSome early bird marketing gurus are already promoting events later in the year\nfielding what they call \"coronavirus crisis experts\". Most of the listed\nexperts happen to be hoteliers who have honed their skills sanitising premises\nand shutting them when the property owner hits the panic button. They are\nintent on telling us what we already know; Covid-19 has knocked tourism topsy\nturvy. There will be no quick fix, and even the promise of big bailouts might\nbe a mixed blessing.\n\nBeware of the low-interest soft loans. The caveat attached to \"low cost\" might\nexpire long before we see the world economy recover enough to make it possible\nto repay the loan.\n\n![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus_new-600x341.jpg)\n\nIt sounds like a good option now, but for many tourism companies, it might\nhamper long-term recovery with even higher debt once the low-interest deal\nexpires.  Governments should reduce costs for tourism and hospitality,\nsubsidising payrolls from social security payments to prevent lay-offs,\nreducing tax, offering free utilities such as electricity and other measures\nthat reduce operational costs and keep staff employed. Soft loans with low-\ninterest rates can turn into a  double-edged sword.\n\nIn truth, we haven't the faintest idea when Covid-19 will allow us to reboot\nand pick up the pieces to rebuild shattered business dreams. It could take\nmonths or years, and that is why soft loans are risky. It's the economic\ndamage and pain that will outlive Covid-19 haunting balances sheets for up to\na decade. For Asia's badly managed airlines, Covid-19 could be the final nail\nin the coffin.\n\nSure, so-called experts dish out wild guesses. They do simple sums that count\nthe months in China from the first cases reported to the spike and a declining\ncurve to zero new cases and pretend the same rule applies to the rest of the\nworld. Usually, the recovery forecasts talk of months, not years. That might\nnot be the case.\n\nCovid-19 dashed our hopes for 2020 in early January, and now at the end of the\nMarch, we witness the first residents of Wuhan in China, the original\nepicentre of the pandemic, coming out of isolation to resume their lives.\nEven though last week China saw the curve flatten and dip to almost no new\ncases, the pandemic has gone on a rampage in Europe and the US while causing a\nsecond wave of new cases in Asia.\n\nWe might look back on 2020 as the tipping point that leads to a global\nrecession, and Covid-19 collateral damage could ultimately change the shape\nand substance of travel globally for years to come not months.\n\nUNWTO quotes the motto \"Putting People First\", and this has to underscore all\nrecovery initiatives. The priority should be to ensure people working in the\ntravel industry have a job to go back to after the crisis is over. They should\nnot be front-line casualties.\n\nSay no to funds and incentives that bailout mega-corporations but leave staff\nand self-employed people in tourism out of work and unable to pay their\nmonthly household bills. People must come first when the bailout budget is\napproved by governments across Asia.\n\nPrevious article[Fit to fly certificate fine for Bangkok\ntransit](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/03/fit-to-fly-is-fine-for-\nbangkok-transit/)\n\nNext article[AirAsia Group hibernates\nfleet](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/03/airasia-group-hibernates-fleet/)\n\n[](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/author/donr/)\n\n[Don Ross](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/author/donr/)\n\n<http://www.ttrweekly.com>\n\n[ __](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/profile-don-ross/ \"Blogger\") [\n__](https://www.facebook.com/don.ross.7315 \"Facebook\") [\n__](mailto:donr@rossttr.com \"Mail\") [ __](donrossth \"Skype\")\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Japan\u2019s-passport-218x150.jpeg)](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/power-\npassports-stalled-by-covid/ \"Power passports stalled by Covid\")\n\n### [Power passports stalled by\nCovid](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/power-passports-stalled-by-\ncovid/ \"Power passports stalled by Covid\")\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shanghi-\nairport-342-218x150.jpg)](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/singapore-\nwaives-airport-levy/ \"Singapore waives airport levy\")\n\n### [Singapore waives airport\nlevy](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/singapore-waives-airport-levy/\n\"Singapore waives airport levy\")\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Singapore_Changi_-\nTerminal_2-218x150.jpg)](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/changi-to-\nclose-terminal-2/ \"Changi to close Terminal 2\")\n\n### [Changi to close Terminal\n2](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/changi-to-close-terminal-2/ \"Changi\nto close Terminal 2\")\n\n____\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/site/2020/03/bailouts-put-people-\nfirst/#respond)\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\n\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n8  \u2212  3  =\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Langkawi-01-1.jpg)](https://naturallylangkawi.my)\n\n#### Recent Comments\n\n  * [Andrew Wood](http://www.ajwoodbkk.com) on [Lockdowns and the plight of the stranded](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/lockdowns-and-the-plight-of-the-stranded/comment-page-1/#comment-130569)\n  * Kevin on [Qatar Airways eases refunds](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/03/qatar-airways-eases-refunds/comment-page-1/#comment-130567)\n  * Chris on [Lockdowns and the plight of the stranded](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/lockdowns-and-the-plight-of-the-stranded/comment-page-1/#comment-130563)\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/TTRW-300x300.jpg)](https://www.sabahtourism.com/)\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-Suite-\nSentation-Banner-TTR_300x300px.jpg)](https://www.royalcliff.com/package/suite-\nsensation/)\n\n[![](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Thale-\nNoi-300x300.jpg)](https://www.tourismthailand.org/home)\n\n###  Stay ahead with the  \nlatest travel news  \non Southeast Asia.\n\n## Subscribe now\n\n###  \n  \n  \n###  \n\n#### POPULAR POSTS\n\n  * [Airlines cull more flights](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/airlines-cull-more-flights/)\n  * [Take a sip of Malaysia\u2019s coffee scene](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/take-a-sip-of-malaysias-coffee-scene/)\n  * [Power passports stalled by Covid](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/power-passports-stalled-by-covid/)\n  * [Smile video a tribute to front-liners](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/smile-video-pays-tribute-to-front-liners/)\n  * [Bangkok Airways: Until we meet again](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/04/bangkok-airways-until-we-meet-again/)\n\n  * [TTR Weekly](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/)\n  * [About Us](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/about-us/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/about-us/contact-us/)\n  * [Useful Links](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/useful-links/)\n  * [Subscribe](https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/subscribe/)\n\nCopyright@2019 - All Rights Reserved.

Other brands, such as Hyundai and Buick,\nhave taken the latter approach.\n\nIn the new 30-second [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-XxLd-\nUMcQ&feature=youtu.be \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-XxLd-\nUMcQ&feature=youtu.be\"), Lexus says, in the voices of various dealers, \u201cWhen\nwe first opened our doors, it didn\u2019t take us long to realize that we weren\u2019t\nin the car business. At Lexus, we were in the people business. We needed to be\nhelpful, respectful, and passionate \u2014 to treat people like guests. It\u2019s what\nwe all signed up for. And now when people need us most, people do what we\u2019ve\nalways done \u2014 take care of people first. The rest will follow.\u201d The images are\nmostly generic shots of people driving, and getting into and out of, Lexus\nmodels.\n\nInstead of having its usual voiceover talent, actress Minnie Driver, do the\nspot, Lexus asked some of its dealers to weigh in with their own words on what\n\u201cpeople first\u201d means to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really simple \u2014 treat people as you would a family member,\u201d John Iacono,\nowner of Lexus dealerships in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, in hard-hit New\nYork City, told the brand. \u201cSaying yes to a request, being mindful and\nthoughtful, and exceeding expectations is the hallmark of being a Lexus\ndealer.\u201d\n\nAdded Laura Thompson Barnes, owner of Lexus dealerships in suburban\nPhiladelphia, \u201cWe open our doors for one reason \u2014 to help people. If we start\nevery day with this basic premise, everything follows.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dalebuss).\n\n[![Dale\nBuss](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58cce503b48641cada32e1fefb1734ee?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/\n\"Photo of Dale Buss\")\n\n[Dale Buss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/)\n\nI have broad interests and experience as a journalist, covering the auto\nbusiness, the consumer-packaged goods industry, entrepreneurship, and others,\nas well as\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nI have broad interests and experience as a journalist, covering the auto\nbusiness, the consumer-packaged goods industry, entrepreneurship, and others,\nas well as politics, culture, media and religion.

pandemic started - has been lifted.\n\nAnyone who has a \"green\" code on a widely used smartphone health app is now\nallowed to leave, for the first time since 23 January.\n\nTrain, road and rail connections have now been re-established.\n\nIt comes after China reported no deaths on Tuesday, the first time since it\nbegan publishing figures.\n\n  * [A cancer patient's border plea: What

lockdowns](/news/world-asia-china-52197054)\n\nTo contain the spread in Wuhan, authorities imposed unprecedented restrictions\non travel and ordered the closure of most businesses in the bustling\nmetropolis, which is home to 11 million people.\n\nChinese authorities have credited these measures with a downturn in infection\nrates, and the vast majority of cases are now being reported outside of China.\n\nLast month, when Wuhan reported its first full week with no new infections,\nshopping malls were re-opened. Some people in \"epidemic-free\" residential\ncompounds have also been allowed to leave their homes for two hours.\n\nFrom Wednesday, approved residents will be able to use public transport if\nthey are also to provide a QR code for scanning. The code is unique for each\nperson and links to their confirmed health status.\n\nPeople engaged in making medical supplies and other daily goods will be\nallowed to return to work. Other industries that impact national or global\nsupply chains will also be able to re-open.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Initially, only those with health clearance\nwill be allowed to leave\n\nEven with a limited air service, 200 flights are scheduled to depart Wuhan on\nWednesday, carrying out 10,000 passengers.\n\nChinese state media has shown aerial footage with nearly 100 high-speed trains\nready to depart and highway roadblocks have been removed.\n\nSome limits on transport will remain in place, however, and schools are still\nclosed until further notice.\n\nWuhan officials have also revoked the \"epidemic-free\" status of 45 residents'\ncompounds because of the emergence of asymptomatic cases, and for other\nunspecified reasons.\n\nStringent lockdowns remain in place across other areas of China. In Beijing,\nwhere 31 new cases were reported on Monday, city authorities have announced\ntough new measures.

For decades, Thae Yong Ho served the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, rising to become Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to London\nbefore defecting.\n\nNow he is standing for election in South Korea's multi-party democracy.\n\nIf he wins his constituency in Gangnam, the wealthy Seoul district made famous\nby rapper Psy, Thae will become the first former Northern official ever to be\ndirectly elected to South Korea's Parliament.\n\nAnd he believes it would send an unmistakable message to the upper echelons of\nwhich he was once part - that abandoning Kim Jong Un's regime could open up a\ndifferent path for the country.\n\n\"I want to tell them that there is a new way for their future,\" Thae said.\n\nThe general assumption in Pyongyang, he explained, is that \"if Korea is\nreunited under the concept of freedom or democracy\", those who have previously\nserved the Kim family \"must be the target of the purge\".\n\n\"I'm sure once we can change the minds of the elite group in North Korea, we\ncan easily bring down the Kim system.\"\n\nVoting styles are radically different on either side of the Demilitarised Zone\nthat divides the neighbours - which are technically still at war.\n\nIn the isolated, nuclear-armed North, citizens line up to cast ballots pre-\nprinted with a single candidate's name, under the watchful gaze of portraits\nof the country's founder Kim Il Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong Il.\n\nIn the South, a plethora of parties compete in a rambunctious, sometimes\nferocious, contest for power, deploying everything from social media campaigns\nto squads of party members bowing to commuters to seek support.\n\nThe April 15 vote will elect a new Parliament through a mix of first-past-the-\npost constituencies like Thae's and proportional representation.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Former North Korean diplomat to run in South's\nelections](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/former-north-korean-\ndiplomat-to-run-in-souths-elections)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [North Korea state media says diplomat defector Thae Yong Ho is a\n'criminal'](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/north-korea-state-\nmedia-says-diplomat-defector-thae-yong-ho-is-a-criminal)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [South Korea ups security for North Korean diplomat defector Thae Yong\nHo](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-ups-security-for-\nnorth-korean-diplomat-defector-thae-yong-ho)\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in's position is not at issue as he is directly elected,\nbut the vote is largely a referendum on his performance.\n\n#### 'ONE BY ONE'\n\nThae comes from a family with good revolutionary credentials but fled his post\nin London in August 2016 after becoming disillusioned with Kim Jong Un's\nregime.\n\nThae said he defected to prevent his children -

the main opposition -\nand has been rewarded with the candidate's nomination for a seat in Gangnam,\none of its electoral strongholds.\n\nIn a bright pink jacket - the colour of his party - he has been out canvassing\namong its designer boutiques and luxury apartment complexes.\n\nIn South Korea's \"bottom up\" democracy, he said, each individual voter's\nsupport had to be secured \"one by one\".\n\n\"If you want to win, you have to go to the streets, you have to bow all the\ntime, you have to say hello,\" he said.\n\n#### 99.99 PERCENT\n\nThere is no such campaigning in North Korea, he says.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [South Korean politicians get creative in campaigning as nation inches\ntowards April 15 polling day](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-\nasia/south-korean-politicians-get-creative-in-campaigning-as-nation-inches-\ntowards-april)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [South Korea's coronavirus crackdown a boon for President Moon ahead of\npolls](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-koreas-coronavirus-\ncrackdown-a-boon-for-president-moon-ahead-of-polls)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [South Korea to allow absentee voting for coronavirus patients in\nparliamentary elections](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-\nkorea-to-allow-absentee-voting-for-coronavirus-patients-in-parliamentary)\n\nThe ruling Workers' Party has an iron grip on power and every five years holds\nan election for the rubber-stamp legislature, known as the Supreme People's\nAssembly.\n\nTurnout at the last poll in March 2019 was 99.99 per cent, the official Korea\nCentral News Agency reported, and \"one hundred per cent of them cast their\nballots for the candidates\".\n\nThe exercise has all the trappings of democracy elsewhere, from electoral\nrolls to sealed ballot boxes, but in keeping with Pyongyang's enduring slogan\nof \"single-minded unity\", there is only one approved name on each paper.\n\nThe authorities, Thae said, \"want to show the world that North Korea is a\nrepublic system. But actually it is a dynasty system.\" \"North Korea's election\nis top down,\" he went on. \"If you win Kim Jong Un then you can be in\nParliament.\"\n\nThe North's state media has denounced Thae as \"human scum\" and accused him of\nembezzling state funds, raping a minor and spying for South Korea in exchange\nfor money.\n\nHe is considered a prime target for assassination - North Korea is widely\nblamed for the poisoning of Kim's older brother Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur\nairport in 2017 - and is accompanied by several bodyguards at all times.\n\nA win could make him an even more marked man, Thae acknowledged, but added:\n\"In order to make a breakthrough or change, anyone must take a risk.\"\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [SOUTH KOREA](/tags/south-korea)\n  * [NORTH KOREA](/tags/north-korea)\n  * [ELECTIONS](/tags/elections)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=From\nPyongyang to Gangnam: Ex-North Korean diplomat Thae Yong Ho now on the ballot\nin Seoul)\n\nPermalink: https://str.sg/Jg5P Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=From\nPyongyang to Gangnam: Ex-North Korean diplomat Thae Yong Ho now on the ballot\nin Seoul)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=From\nPyongyang to Gangnam: Ex-North Korean diplomat Thae Yong Ho now on the ballot\nin Seoul)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=from-pyongyang-to-gangnam-ex-north-korean-diplomat-\nthae-yong-ho-now-on-the-ballot-in)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?

The[NY Times just\nreported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-\nestimate.html) that between 160 million and 214 million people are likely to\nbe infected (CDC confidential study) and as many as 200,000 to 1.7 million\npeople could die. For those of you who have had pneumonia before (I've had it\nand it is really impossible to kick), you probably feel like I do: I'm pretty\nnervous._\n\nFor those of you who are my age (60s), we are seriously worried about this\ncrisis. Some of us may be highly susceptible to the illness, and we want to\nfeel safe above all.\n\nYes, a ton of vendors have pounced on this problem and are now promoting\nonline learning systems, video conferencing systems, and all different types\nof digital tools. That's not the point.\n\nThe real point is that people are scared, and as a result, we have to create a\nsense of trust, shared responsibility, and safety.\n\nThe US Federal Government has not been doing this well. Not only is it\ndifficult to get clear information, but the #1 goal appears to be focused on\nthe economy. It's clear from the stock market that last night's discussion\ndidn't go well.  In fact, if you look at the S&P 500 (chart below) not only\nhave we lost more than two years of stock market growth, we may even wipe out\nthe entire stock market growth in the current presidency.\n\nToday In: [Leadership Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/leadership-strategy)\n\n  * [\n\n### The Key To Decisive Action At Defining Moments Like This One\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminkomlos/2020/04/08/the-key-to-decisive-\naction-at-defining-moments-like-this-one/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.: Man For Others, Servant Leader\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williammeehan/2020/04/08/anthony-s-fauci-md-\nman-for-others-servant-leader/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Judges Slap Down USCIS Again On H-1B Visas\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/04/08/judges-slap-down-\nuscis-again-on-h-1b-visas/)\n\nAnd remember that the stock market is not a barometer of the economy: it's a\nfuture-looking view of where investors think things are going. So the outlook\nhas plummeted at near-record rates.\n\nS&P 500 This Week\n\nJosh Bersin\n\nWhat did we learn from that episode? For me as a business person,\nprofessional, and analyst, the message here is clear. What we need is a focus\non people, not business.\n\nIn many ways, this feels like 9/11, but taking place in slow motion.\n\nThen, as in now, if we focus on people, the economy will take care of itself\nover time.  People are worried, so they aren't traveling, eating out, or even\ngoing to work.\n\nAnd if you're not concerned, think about a hurricane warning. When the\nGovernor warns of a hurricane and forces people to evacuate, it's a huge\ninconvenience. But isn't that ok anyway? At least we were prepared - and if\nthe hurricane misses us we just feel lucky.\n\nRemember that was the way the country felt about AIDS, until Rock Hudson was\ndiagnosed. We just learned that Tom Hanks is infected, so this feels real to\neveryone.\n\n**Your Role In Business: Create A Sense of Trust**\n\nJust as we found in 9/11, we need to build a sense of safety, trust, and\ncollective thinking in our people.\n\nI recently read the [2020 Edelman Trust\nBarometer](https://www.edelman.com/trustbarometer) and their finding was very\nclear. Trust is based on three things:  **competence** (doing things well),\n**ethics** (living by an ethical value system), and **voice** (giving people a\nchance to speak).\n\nAs Edelman points out, today the trust matrix is challenged. The most trusted\ninstitution in our lives is our companies, and even here our ethics are\nchallenged.\n\nEdelman Trust Barometer\n\nEdelman\n\nRemember, as I [discussed in a recent\narticle](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-experience-its-1-issue-work-\neven-right-now-josh-bersin/), the people in your company are the ones who will\npull you out of a financial slowdown.The Coronavirus then represents an\nopportunity. If you focus on your people in a competent and ethical way, and\nyou listen to their needs, you can drive up trust, teamwork, and resilience.\n\nThis means making decisions (work at home, social distancing, paid time off,\nfinancial assistance for testing, education on the virus) that help individual\npeople feel safe, protected and heard.\n\nBy the way, Amy Edmondson from Harvard has proven that companies [that promote\nsafety, ethics, and voice drive tremendous business\nresults](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/How-Fearless-Organizations-\nSucceed). Her book [The Fearless\nOrganization](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-\nWorkplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247) points out how creating a true and genuine\nsense of safety drives results.\n\n**What About The Slowdown?   The Pressure To Lay People Off.**\n\nClearly, there is going to be an economic slowdown, and this will result in\nlayoffs and reduced pay. And the [pressure to lay people off is\ngrowing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economic-outlook-hinges-on-layoff-\ndecisions-11584110104) (last week 211,000 people filed for unemployment and\ncompanies like United Airlines, Wal-Mart, Southwest, and others are thinking).\n\nAgain I ask you to think about people first.\n\nResearch shows that when these periods occur, [companies that go through deep\nlayoffs always underperform in the\nfuture](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/20/do-massive-layoffs-\nreally-benefit-companies.aspx). (Many go out of business.)\n\nWhy? There are many things that work against you: first, you lose valued\nskills; second, you lose customer relationships; but worst of all, the people\nwho remain go through \"survivor syndrome,\" asking themselves \"am I going to be\nnext?\"\n\n\u201cThese are the kinds of times that define the character of a company,\u201d\n[Microsoft President Brad Smith said in an\ninterview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economic-outlook-hinges-on-layoff-\ndecisions-11584110104). \u201cPeople want to work for an employer that cares about\nthe bottom line and the well-being of its employees.\u201d\n\nI'm hoping the Coronavirus won't be as bad as we think, but right now people\nare uncertain and afraid.\n\nSo as I [mentioned last week](https://joshbersin.com/2020/03/the-coronavirus-\ndid-we-somehow-deserve-this/), let's slow down, accept the business\ninterruption that's going to take place, and take care of the people. In\ntoday's world the CEO has to be the \"Chief Empathy Officer\" first.\n\nIf we do this the recovery will be faster, and our companies, lives, and\nentire society will be better off.\n\nMore to come on this topic.\n\n_PS: If you want to really understand how to drive Values and Voice in your\ncompany, look at our just-launched program in the[Josh Bersin Academy: Voice,\nValues and HR](https://bersinacademy.com/voice-values-and-hr).  It will show\nyou how to help employees speak up when they don't feel comfortable or safe at\nwork._\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Josh_Bersin) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin).

The world of work\nhas changed in the last couple of weeks, and companies are navigating new\nchallenges. Nearly everyone, it seems, is embracing \u2014 or at least testing \u2014\nthe future of work.\n\nAs per LinkedIn\u2019s latest report, Global Talent Trends 2020, four trends stand\nout which will reshape the talent hiring and recruitment landscape - the\nemergence of employee experience, the spread of people analytics, the return\nof internal recruiting, and the ascent of the multigenerational workforce.\n\nHowever, these trends are all defined in some measure by their demand for\nempathy \u2014 the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Today,\nmore businesses are grinding gears to understand their talent more deeply than\never before, in order to serve them better. This new focus on empathy is\nencouraging companies to put themselves in their employees\u2019 shoes.\n\n_**Employee experience could be the new HR**_\n\nCompanies are beginning to work for employees, and not just the other way\naround. Today, employee experience (EX) goes beyond what we earlier understood\nto be \u2018employee engagement\u2019. What does it exactly mean? The central idea is to\nactively collaborate with employees to understand their point of view and\ndesign experiences that allow people to do their best work.\n\nAs companies become more employee-centric, they\u2019re creating more \u201cemployee\nexperience\u201d roles. Mature organizations are hiring dedicated EX personnel,\nwhile smaller companies are bypassing \u201cHuman Resources\u201d altogether and\nbranding their people function \u201cEmployee Experience\u201d right out of the gate. In\nfact, the number of LinkedIn members whose current job titles include the\nphrase \u201cemployee experience\u201d has seen a 2.4X increase since 2014. In India,\n95% talent professionals believe that EX will be very important in shaping the\nfuture of HR and recruiting, with 77% of them focused on EX to improve\nretention.\n\n_**Using data to build people-first companies**_\n\nWhile employee experience is quickly becoming the cornerstone of hiring and\nretaining talent, meaningful insights will inform talent decisions at every\nlevel of the recruiting cycle. Therefore, understanding and capitalizing on\npeople analytics is quickly becoming a must-have skill in HR. People analytics\nessentially connects data to effective decision-making. It draws insights from\nhuman behavior to help people and companies perform better. It uses formal\nscientific methods to support empathy. In India, 92% of talent professionals,\nthe highest across the world, believe people analytics will be the future of\nHR.\n\nTalent leaders have understood the value of people analytics for some time, as\nit has promised to revolutionize recruiting and HR for a decade. But until\nrecently, only the most sophisticated companies have reaped the benefits. Now\nwe\u2019re reaching an inflection point where data is accessible to all.\nUnderstanding and capitalizing on analytics is quickly becoming a must-have\nskill in HR.\n\nIn fact, over the past five years, LinkedIn has witnessed a 242% increase in\nHR professionals with data analysis skills. Still, many companies are only at\nthe early stages of developing people analytics functions.\n\nWhether organizations use data to derive workforce insights, chart down career\npaths for employees, improve their day-to-day workplace experience, or\nharmonize different generations - they must remain cognizant of the fact that\ntheir businesses are being run by people. Their existence in, and contribution\nto, every level of the process is the driving force that steers businesses\ntowards success. To fully appreciate the impact people analytics can have,\nit\u2019s helpful to see where companies intend to go. Top growth areas include\nanalyzing competitive intelligence, flight risks, and candidate success.\n\nFor instance, professional services firm Genpact was looking at building a\nteam of high-potential engineers with expertise in building and scaling\nsoftware platforms. To hire such talent, the talent acquisition teams had to\ngo back to the drawing board. Using LinkedIn\u2019s data and insights, the talent\nacquisition teams gave the leadership and hiring managers a clear picture of\ntalent availability in the market, which included specific companies to target\nand compensation benchmarks. Empowered with the right data and insights,\nGenpact targeted 200 specific candidates through personalised talent marketing\ncampaigns. In less than 4 weeks, the team was able to shortlist over 21 senior\ntech professionals, and hire them through a customized interview process and\nget them on board, faster.\n\n_**Closing the gaps in understanding talent**_\n\nWhile the focus on EX is skyrocketing, only 52% of talent professionals say\ntheir company provides a positive employee experience. This means that\norganizations still have a lot of work to do. One reason why employee\nexperience suffers may be that while companies are listening to workers,\nthey\u2019re not always taking action. Our global data says that employees who\ndon\u2019t believe their company will act on their feedback are 7x more likely to\nbe disengaged than those who do, according to data from Glint. Clearly,\ninnovative approaches are called for -- new tools are emerging to help\norganizations close the gap between feedback and action. The right technology\ncan help leaders build habits around regular conversations with their teams\nand encourage action at every level of the organization.\n\nWhen it comes to people analytics, there\u2019s a steep learning curve from\ncollecting data to capitalizing on the insights to build a competitive\nadvantage. Almost half of companies feel good about maintaining clean,\naccurate data. But only 39% feel good drawing meaningful insights from their\ndata. There\u2019s a similar drop-off in the transition from \u201cacting\u201d (i.e.,\nsolving existing problems with insights) to \u201ccapitalizing\u201d (taking advantage\nof new opportunities with insights). For example, many might be comfortable\nacting after a spike in attrition, but fewer would be able to proactively hire\nahead of a spike in demand.\n\nWhile some of the areas where companies are currently using analytics include\nemployee performance and workforce planning, one cautionary note is that it is\ncritically important to be careful with people data. Experts recommend\ntreating employees as stakeholders as organizations develop thoughtful and\ntransparent policies.\n\nToday, as we deal with the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus, the most\nimportant topic in HR remains improving employee experience with empathy at\nthe core. Hence, keeping compassion at your foundation can produce better\nbusiness results and build an indispensable workplace culture.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

The People First Initiative is\neffective between April 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020, and is aimed at addressing\nchallenges taxpayers may face due to COVID-19.\n\n**Installment Agreements and Offers in Compromise**\n\nInstallment Payment Agreements and Offers in Compromise are tools to enable\ntaxpayers to pay taxes when they are unable to pay the full amount of their\nliability. The IRS may enter into an Installment Payment Agreement with a\ntaxpayer to spread the payments due over time, subject to interest charges and\nlate payment penalties. If the IRS is seeking to collect a tax due from a\ntaxpayer that is beyond the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay in full or in\ninstallments, or if IRS collection actions would create economic hardship for\nthe taxpayer, the IRS may be willing to settle the tax liability for less than\nthe full amount due pursuant to an Offer in Compromise. The taxpayer seeking\nan Offer in Compromise is charged with initiating the process as instructed on\nthe IRS\u2019s website at\n[irs.gov](https://gtlawinfo.com/collect/click.aspx?u=NlZBVVhVK3c1dzFvRGNXUzNRbmtyTm1Wa0lUQW9xM3lrUDI5TUlLMWtGVnFYWlJkcTZyblFjNTd4NnJSRDRGYw==&rh=ff005dc914d8c1f8893fa319a3469e2c85ec6821).\n\nThe People First Initiative suspends payments due between April 1 and July 15,\n2020, under existing Installment Payment Agreements. The IRS also announced it\nwill not default any Installment Payment Agreements during this period\nalthough interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n\nSimilarly, the People First Initiative suspends payments due under existing\nOffers in Compromise and allows taxpayers until July 15, 2020, to provide any\nrequested information to support a pending Offer in Compromise. The IRS also\nannounced it will not default an Offer in Compromise if a taxpayer is\ndelinquent in filing a 2018 tax return although the taxpayer should file the\ndelinquent 2018 and the current 2019 returns on or before July 15, 2020.\n\nThe IRS also encouraged taxpayers who are unable to fully pay their federal\ntaxes to enter into new monthly Installment Payment Agreements or, if their\ntax liabilities exceed their net worth, to pursue an Offer in Compromise.

Liens and levies (including seizures of a personal residence)\ninitiated by field officers will generally be suspended. Moreover, the IRS\nwill not forward new delinquent accounts to private collection agencies or to\nthe Department of State to prevent passport receipt or renewal.\n\n_Examinations_\n\nThe IRS generally will not start new field, office or correspondence\nexaminations during the Initiative period. Existing examinations may continue\nremotely and taxpayers are encouraged to respond to outstanding requests for\ninformation if they are able to do so during this period.\n\nAlthough IRS personnel are permitted to take actions to preserve relevant\nstatues of limitations they generally will only seek extensions of the statute\nof limitations where the statute is set to expire during 2020.\n\nThe IRS [previously\nannounced](https://gtlawinfo.com/collect/click.aspx?u=NlZBVVhVK3c1dzFvRGNXUzNRbmtyTm1Wa0lUQW9xM3lrUDI5TUlLMWtGVnFYWlJkcTZyblFUVTdUaGt6RVpVbk9FUUVlMDRkOFFzVXJud0ZqMk5wVXUvTUJiMEJGMVRPazNkOVRvSkZyUWFIajhDVUY2MFlZNkJOcWRMQTNvc2hRZzRVeWZNT0dkUUE1TTVCUTBZa2hnMUhXOGc3Z3QrSUpJRzFJTVZ4SzhrPQ==&rh=ff005dc914d8c1f8893fa319a3469e2c85ec6821)\nthat it was scaling back some of its operations to focus on \u201cmission-critical\nactivities\u201d and has closed many IRS offices in areas hardest hit by COVID-19.\nThe reduction of services and workforce may lead to significant wait times\nwhen dealing with the IRS.\n\n\u00a92020 Greenberg Traurig, LLP.

Kristi\nRubenstein\n\n![The 38 Most Engaged Workplaces in the World Put People\nFirst](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/qaxk04-p10krflv7pfmgfa.jpg)\n\nThe workplace could be better. Burnout is officially a medical diagnosis\naccording to a 2019 announcement from the World Health Organization, and\nmanagers -- the key figures in helping employees manage chronic workplace\nstress -- are the most burned out of all. Only 15% of employees are engaged\nworldwide, and in the U.S. just 35% of the workforce is engaged -- that is,\ninvolved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to their work and workplace.\n\nWith so many employees not engaged, exceptional workplaces perhaps feel more\naspirational than attainable. Any yet, 38 organizations around the world beg\nto differ. In the midst of rapid workplace changes, they have found an\napproach that not only improves business outcomes, but creates cultures that\nmake employees _want_ to come to work every day.\n\nFor more than a decade, Gallup has recognized the most engaged workplace\ncultures in the world with the Gallup Great Workplace Award. This year, we are\nrenaming it the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award (GEWA) to more fully\ncapture the extraordinary achievement of the winners who meet the [rigorous\nstandards](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/244277/gallup-workplace-\nawards.aspx#ite-244289) set by the most [comprehensive workplace study ever\nconducted](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-\nreport-2016.aspx).\n\nAt winning organizations, 71% of employees are engaged. On average, the ratio\nof engaged to disengaged employees is 17.5-to-1 -- nearly seven (6.5) times\nthe U.S. rate and 21 times the rate for workforces globally.\n\nAt winning organizations, 71% of employees are engaged.\n\nThese exceptional engagement rates extend to managers too. In GEWA-winning\norganizations there are 25.3 engaged managers to every one disengaged manager\ncompared with 6.6 engaged managers to every one disengaged manager at other\norganizations. Manager engagement is extremely important, because engaged\nmanagers are more likely to create high development cultures that maximize\nhuman potential.\n\nEngaged managers also cooperate with other managers and their teams across the\norganization. Managers who create high development cultures reduce burnout --\nemployees who strongly agree that they feel supported by their manager are 70%\nless likely to experience burnout regularly. Engaged managers are far more\nlikely to build an inclusive workplace culture where employees feel like they\nbelong, are respected, and have what they need to perform at their best.\n\nGEWA winners make people the key component of their business strategy, and\nthey create a culture to match.\n\nThe demands of the workplace are shifting but a culture that is aligned with\nthe needs of the new workforce addresses the mission and purpose, development\nand coaching that employees need for high performance. And Gallup's analytics\nprove that employee engagement drives business improvement, from lower\nturnover to higher customer engagement to higher profitability:\n\n>   * **41% lower** absenteeism\n>   * **24% lower** turnover (high-turnover organizations)\n>   * **59% lower** turnover (low-turnover organizations)\n>   * **28% less** shrinkage\n>   * **70% fewer** employee safety incidents\n>   * **58% fewer** patient safety incidents\n>   * **40% fewer** quality incidents (defects)\n>   * **10% higher** customer metrics\n>   * **17% higher** productivity\n>   * **20% higher** sales\n>   * **21% higher** profitability\n>\n\nGEWA winners make people the key component of their business strategy, and\nthey create a culture to match. This culture changes the relationships between\nemployees and managers and the customers and clients they serve. They reach\nambitious heights of success because every member of the organization feels\nconnected to the mission and has the opportunity to reach their full\npotential. Employees know their opinions count, that they are making a\ndifference, and that it's possible to bring their best to work every day and\nlive the life they want.\n\nCongratulations to the 2020

awards?\n\n**1\\. Sample size:** While many workplace awards only require a small sample\nof survey participants, we ask for the opinions of every employee.\n\n**2\\. High qualifying score:** Winners must achieve a qualifying score that\nplaces them in the upper echelon of organizations.\n\nEach company's employee engagement is measured using [Gallup's Q12\nsurvey](https://www.gallup.com/access/239210/employee-engagement-survey.aspx)\n\\-- a survey that asks employees questions that tie to their performance,\ntheir commitment to their organization and specific business metrics.\n\nThe results are compared with [Gallup's extensive employee engagement\ndatabase](https://www.gallup.com/access/239210/employee-engagement-\nsurvey.aspx) including 35 million respondents and more than 3 million\nworkgroups from 195 countries -- only companies in the top tier qualify.\n\n**3\\. Detailed evidence** : Organizations submit information about their\nstrategy and leadership, performance and accountability, communication and\nknowledge management, and development and ongoing learning. A panel of Gallup\nworkplace scientists and experts evaluates applicants and assesses them\nagainst criteria established by [the most exhaustive workplace study ever\nconducted](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-\nreport-2016.aspx).

But this time, he does not expect his peers to follow his lead.\n\nThe 29-year-old is part of the JDT team of players, coaches and staff who have\nagreed to take a 33 per cent pay cut from this month to chip in to the Johor\nDisaster Fund.\n\nHe believes those who have more should contribute during this difficult\nperiod, but also feels people should not be forced to do so.\n\nHe told The Straits Times: \"At JDT, we are well-paid and well looked after.\nWith many people in Johor suffering and struggling with the virus and the\nlockdown, we feel that we need to help.\"\n\nThe Malaysia Super League (MSL) club are noted not just for their generous\nwages - with players like Hariss earning over $30,000 a month - but also for\ntheir philanthropy.\n\nIn 2016, the Southern Tigers gave financial aid to Brazilian side Chapecoense,\nwho were decimated by a plane crash. The following year, they donated their\nMalaysia Cup prize money to help flood victims in Penang. Last year, they\nraised RM680,000 (S$223,200) for charity through an exhibition match at Larkin\nStadium.\n\nTheir latest pay cut is in line with what top European clubs like Barcelona,\nJuventus and Bayern Munich have done. But Premier League clubs have been slow\nto react, drawing widespread criticism.\n\nIn Singapore, there have been discussions about the matter, while across the\nCauseway, the Malaysian Football League staff will take a 10 to 20 per cent\npay cut. But the Professional Footballers Association of Malaysia (PFAM) has\nresisted the same move for players (outside of JDT), stating that many of\ntheir members do not earn big salaries.\n\nMSL giants Selangor have already assured their players and staff that they\nwill not face pay cuts.\n\nFootball website Goal.com reported that an internal memo dated on Saturday and\nwritten by club president Tengku Amir Shah Sultan Sharafuddin read: \"I am\npleased to inform that Selangor's finances for the next few months are solid.\n\n\"The management will hold discussions with our sponsors... to ensure that the\nsponsorship deals that have been agreed will continue to be received.\"\n\nHariss has backed the PFAM.\n\n> WE DO WHAT WE CAN\n>\n> **We don't all earn the same. A percentage means different things to\n> different people, who have different responsibilities.**\n>\n> HARISS HARUN, Lions captain and father of two, acknowledging that\n> circumstances are not the same for every player.\n\n\"We don't all earn the same. A percentage means different things to different\npeople, who have different responsibilities,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course, it would be nice that those who have more can help, but I feel you\ncan't force every footballer to take a pay cut. These things should be\nencouraged, not forced.\"\n\nAs the world tries to contain the contagion, one thing that is enforced is\nthat football training and matches have stopped in most leagues. The last\nsession for JDT - who have won the MSL for six straight years and lead the\ntable with 10 points after four games - was on March 15.\n\nSince then, Hariss has been going to the gym to keep up with his club's\nfitness programme but the circuit-breaker measures introduced by the\nGovernment last week means he has to improvise further. He has weights and\nresistant bands at his Punggol home but is looking to get an exercise bike.\n\nThe father of a five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter said: \"We just\nhave to adapt as best as we can. Like most people, we footballers are also\nworried about our livelihood, but there are also more important things out\nthere.\n\n\"For me, it's a chance to bond with my children at home.\n\n\"Only when everyone does their part and be socially responsible, will we be\nable to get through this crisis.\"\n\nHave a question on the coronavirus outbreak?

Readers can call their offices or visit\ntheir websites to apply for these programs, and follow through on them once\nthe quarantines are lifted.\n\nOn top of the this is P31 billion for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s various\nprograms which also includes 3 billion for farmers\u2019 social amelioration, apart\nfrom the P7-billion palay procurement program for the farm sector.\n\nTruth is, this is the first time we are seeing direct cash transfers to the\nvulnerable, and large sums for food production in the rural sector, where a\nlot of the 18 million vulnerable families live.\n\nThis unprecedented amount is the first time such a massive social program was\never launched by a Philippine government on its own. The nearest instance\nwould be the post-World War 2 rehabilitation effort, fed mainly by American\nmoney through the US Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946, the parity rights\namendment, and Japanese war reparations.\n\nLooking deeper into the Bayanihan law's social components, it is not only a\nsafety net for vulnerable sectors, but economic stimulus that creates demand\nfor many of the products and services provided by many microbusinesses and\nfarms, especially in the rural and depressed urban areas -- a welcome cash\ninfusion in the provinces to sop up excess produce now that the harvest season\nis upon us.\n\nTo illustrate my point, I just bought a kilo of fresh squid and shrimp at 20%\nless than the prevailing market price (already lower than usual) from an\nambulant vendor straight from the Davao fishport.\n\nHe was among many who sell food to their immediate neighbors. A cash infusion\nin their neighborhoods provides income for their daily trade, and livelihood\nfor the local fisherfolk who fish and farmers who harvest local vegetables.\n\nNow, if he and others like him can borrow from the SB Corps P3-million fund\nthey can obtain working capital to buy more from fishers and deliver the same\nto more households, earning more per unit of time during the limited workday\n-- while helping feed hundreds.\n\nThey gamely told me that business is actually brisk despite the community\nquarantine, and that some items in their icebox are \u201creserved\u201d by some regular\ncustomers.\n\nThe Bayanihan package deals with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nmitigating the risk that the depressed purchasing power will not provide the\nneeded demand to drive local business, consume food harvests, and sustain\nlivelihoods in an economy where growth is expected to drop to 2% from the\ncurrent 6%, according to the Asian Development Bank.\n\nIn the end, the Bayanihan law is putting people first, making good economic\nsense because it is investing in their capability to consume our farm produce\nand be customers that sustain our businesses in these times, preserving jobs.\nIn turn, we entrepreneurs can look forward to growth upon which banks lend us\ncredit to rebuild the working capital, the means for sustaining our businesses\nand recovering losses.\n\nStay safe, everyone!\n\n\n\nTags: [John Tria](https://news.mb.com.ph/tag/john-tria/)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n[](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/covid-19-and-law-schools/)\n\n#####  [COVID-19 and law\nschools](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/covid-19-and-law-schools/)\n\n[](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/what-the-lockdown-has-revealed/)\n\n#####  [What the lockdown has\nrevealed](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/what-the-lockdown-has-revealed/)\n\n[](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/no-basis-for-fear-of-a-rice-shortage/)\n\n#####  [No basis for fear of a rice shortage\n](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/no-basis-for-fear-of-a-rice-shortage/)\n\n### Popular Post\n\n[![\\(MANILA BULLETIN\\)](https://news.mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/dohcorona.jpg)](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/252-health-\nworkers-infected-with-covid-19-doh/)\n\n###  [252 health workers infected with COVID-19 \u2013\nDOH](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/252-health-workers-infected-with-\ncovid-19-doh/)\n\n[![Department of Foreign Affairs \\(MANILA\nBULLETIN\\)](https://news.mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/DFA123.jpg)](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/dfa-\nnotes-decline-in-covid-19-cases-among-overseas-filipinos/)\n\n###  [DFA notes decline in COVID-19 cases among overseas\nFilipinos](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/dfa-notes-decline-in-\ncovid-19-cases-among-overseas-filipinos/)\n\n[![Mayor Rex Gatchalian](https://news.mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/rexg1.jpg)](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/valenzuela-\ncity-begins-covid-19-mass-testing-on-black-saturday/)\n\n###  [Valenzuela City begins COVID-19 mass testing on Black\nSaturday](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/08/valenzuela-city-begins-\ncovid-19-mass-testing-on-black-saturday/)\n\n### Magazines\n\n![Bannawag - May 7, 2018](https://mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/050718bann.png)[](http://manilabulletin.pressreader.com/bannawag)\n\n![Bisaya - May 9, 2018](https://mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/050918bis.png)[](http://manilabulletin.pressreader.com/bisaya)\n\n![Garage - Dec17 / Jan18](https://mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/garagedec18jan19.jpg)[](http://manilabulletin.pressreader.com/garage)\n\n![Liwayway - May 7, 2018](https://mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/050718liw.png)[](http://manilabulletin.pressreader.com/liwayway)\n\n![Wedding Essentials - Vol 15 Issue 2](https://mb.com.ph/wp-\ncontent/uploads/wexvii.jpg)[](http://weddingessentials.ph/)\n\n[![MB Logo](//mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/MB-Logo.png)](//mb.com.ph/)\n\n  * [Home](http://mb.com.ph/)\n  * [News](https://news.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Business](http://business.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Entertainment](http://entertainment.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Sports](http://sports.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Lifestyle](http://lifestyle.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Tech](http://technology.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Special](http://newsbits.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [About MB](http://mb.com.ph/company-profile-of-manila-bulletin/)\n  * [Contact MB](http://mb.com.ph/contact-us/)\n  * [Subscribe](http://subscription.mb.com.ph/)\n  * [Advertise](http://mb.com.ph/advertise/)\n  * [Privacy Policy](http://mb.com.ph/privacy-policy/)\n  * [RSS](http://mb.com.ph/feed/)\n\n\u00a9 2016 mb.com.ph |  \nPhilippine News.

President Trump is incapable of providing leadership,\nand instead continues to mislead the public and act out of political self-\ninterest. So it is Congress that must lead, and it must do so now.\n\nWith anxiety growing, everyone in our country needs to know that, in the midst\nof this horrific pandemic and economic meltdown, their government is doing\neverything possible to keep them healthy and financially secure.\n\nIn other words, we need to build upon and expand the recent stimulus package\nwith new and bolder emergency legislation which must be passed as soon as\npossible. Here are a few core principles that must be included in that\nlegislation.\n\nFirst, Congress must explicitly authorize that the Defense Production Act is\nfully utilized to demand that the private sector start delivering the\nequipment and products that our medical personnel desperately need in order to\ntreat their patients. We cannot rely on Trump to do it.\n\nRecent reporting has revealed that the Trump administration did not start\nordering crucial equipment like masks until March. It is beyond comprehension\nthat, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, doctors and nurses throughout the\ncountry are putting their lives on the line because they lack an adequate\nsupply of surgical masks, gloves and gowns. We must also produce the\nventilators as well as the various kinds of testing kits that we need now and\nwill need in the future, as well as the dwindling supply of certain\nprescription drugs that are essential to treat the virus. States and hospitals\nshould not have to compete against each other. The federal government must\ntake the lead in coordinating efforts.\n\n> Now more than any point in recent history, we are in this together. We must\n> act with love, compassion and urgency\n\nFurther, during this crisis, every American must be able to receive all of the\nhealthcare they need regardless of income. Before the pandemic, 87 million\npeople were uninsured or underinsured. That number is rapidly escalating as\nmillions of workers are not only losing their jobs but are also losing their\nemployer-based health insurance.\n\nThe cost of hospital treatment for the coronavirus amounts to tens of\nthousands of dollars. Tragically, we have already seen people who have delayed\ntreatment due to concerns about cost. In this pandemic, lack of insurance will\nlead to more deaths and more Covid-19 transmissions.\n\nAs long as this pandemic continues, Medicare must be empowered to pay all of\nthe deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for the\nuninsured and the underinsured. No one in America who is sick, regardless of\nimmigration status, should be afraid to seek the medical treatment they need\nduring this national crisis.\n\nObviously, Congress must not only address the pandemic crisis, it must also\nact with a fierce sense of urgency to effectively deal with the economic\ncrisis as well.\n\nIn the last two weeks, a record-breaking 10 million people filed unemployment\nclaims \u2013 more than during the entire 2008 Great Recession. Frighteningly, the\nSt Louis Federal Reserve projects that 47 million more people may become\nunemployed by the end of June, with unemployment reaching 32%. While such\nestimates may be a worst-case scenario, the reality of the pandemic has taught\nus that worst-case scenarios are what we must plan for. For the sake of\nworking families all over this country, we must be prepared for all\ncontingencies.\n\nWe cannot wait before taking the bold action that is necessary. In my view, it\nmakes a lot more sense to prevent the collapse of our economy than figuring\nout how we put it back together after it crumbles. Simply stated, that means\nthat every worker must keep receiving his or her paycheck and benefits during\nthe crisis. In the recent emergency relief bill, Congress appropriated over\n$25bn in grants to the airline companies so that 2 million workers in that\nindustry will continue to receive their full paycheck and benefits through 30\nSeptember. And that is exactly what we must do for every worker in America.\nThis is not a radical idea. It is similar to what France, Norway, Denmark, the\nUK and other countries are doing.\n\nFurther, as quickly as possible, we must get money into the hands of people by\nimmediately providing a $2,000 monthly emergency payment to every person in\nthe country until the crisis has passed.\n\nIn addition, we must guarantee paid medical and sick leave to all workers. It\nhas been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to\nstay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a\nresult of the second coronavirus relief package. We have got to increase this\nfigure to 100%.\n\nMoreover, workers who are on the frontlines of this crisis including those who\nwork in grocery stores, warehouses, paramedics, nurses, pharmacies, domestic\nworkers, postal workers, farm workers, public transit, truck drivers and\njanitors must receive $500 a week hazard pay, childcare and a safe and secure\nworkplace.\n\nFinally, we must put an immediate moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and\nutility shut-offs, and suspend payments on rent and mortgage loans for primary\nresidences during this crisis.\n\nThis is a frightening and devastating time for our country, and the world.\nNever before in our lifetimes have we had to deal with both a public health\npandemic and an economic meltdown.\n\nThe American people deserve and require leadership from Washington that acts\naggressively, puts working people first, and provides peace-of-mind to the\nmost vulnerable people in our country. Now more than any point in recent\nhistory, we are in this together. We must act with love, compassion and\nurgency.\n\nHistorians will look back at this time to see how we dealt with this\nunprecedented crisis. I hope they will observe that we responded with the\ncourage and boldness that the moment required.\n\n  * [Bernie Sanders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders) is US senator from

in China and began spreading around the world,\nincluding in the United States, President Donald Trump\u2019s many critics in the\nAmerican foreign-policy establishment were quick to identify him as part of\nthe problem. Trump had campaigned on an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy, which\nafter his victory was enshrined in the official National Security Strategy\nthat his administration published in 2017. At the time, I served in the\nadministration and orchestrated the writing of that document. In the years\nsince, Trump has been criticized for supposedly overturning the post\u2013World War\nII order and rejecting the role the United States has long played in the\nworld. Amid a global pandemic, he\u2019s being accused\u2014on this site and\nelsewhere\u2014of alienating allies, undercutting multinational cooperation, and\ncausing America to fight the coronavirus alone.\n\nAnd yet even as the current emergency has proved him right in fundamental\nways\u2014about China specifically and foreign policy more generally\u2014many\nrespectable people in the United States are letting their disdain for the\npresident blind them to what is really going on in the world. Far from\ndiscrediting Trump\u2019s point of view, the COVID-19 crisis reveals what his\nstrategy asserted: that the world is a competitive arena in which great power\nrivals like China seek advantage, that the state remains the irreplaceable\nagent of international power and effective action, that international\ninstitutions have limited capacity to transform the behavior and preferences\nof states.\n\n[Kori Schake: ](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/america-\nfirst-is-making-the-pandemic-worse/608401/)[The damage that \u2018America first\u2019\nhas done](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/america-first-is-\nmaking-the-pandemic-worse/608401/)\n\nChina, America\u2019s most powerful rival, has played a particularly harmful role\nin the current crisis, which began on its soil. Initially, that country\u2019s lack\nof transparency prevented prompt action that might have contained the virus.\nIn Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, Chinese officials initially punished\ncitizens for \u201cspreading rumors\u201d about the disease. The lab in Shanghai that\nfirst published the genome of the virus on open platforms was [shut\ndown](about:blank) the next day for \u201crectification,\u201d as the Hong Kong-based\n_South China Morning Post_ reported in February. Apparently at the behest of\nofficials at the Wuhan health commission, [news reports\nindicate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/10/wuhan-officials-\ntried-cover-up-covid-19-sent-it-careening-outward/), visiting teams of experts\nfrom elsewhere in China were prevented from speaking freely to doctors in the\ninfectious-disease wards. Some experts had suspected human-to-human\ntransmission, but their inquiries were rebuffed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us the\ntruth,\u201d one team member said of the local authorities, \u201cand from what we now\nknow of the real situation then, they were lying\u201d to us.\n\nNow China\u2019s propagandists are competing to create a narrative that obscures\nthe origins of the crisis and that [blames the United\nStates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-\nconspiracy-theory.html) for the virus. This irresponsible behavior and lack of\ntransparency revealed what Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy had identified\nearly on: that \u201ccontrary to our hopes, China expanded its power at the expense\nof others.\u201d Instead of becoming a \u201c[responsible\nstakeholder](https://www.ncuscr.org/sites/default/files/migration/Zoellick_remarks_notes06_winter_spring.pdf)\u201d\u2014a\nterm George W. Bush\u2019s administration used to describe the role it hoped\nBeijing would play following China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization\nin 2001\u2014the Chinese Communist Party used the advantages of WTO membership to\nadvance a political and economic system at odds with America\u2019s free and open\nsociety. Previous National Security Strategy documents had tiptoed around\nChina\u2019s adversarial conduct, as if calling out that country as a competitor\u2014as\nthe 2017 document unequivocally did\u2014was somehow impolite.\n\n[Lindsay Gorman: ](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/5g-where-\nchina-and-west-finally-diverge/604309/)[5G is where China and the West finally\ndiverge](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/5g-where-china-and-\nwest-finally-diverge/604309/)\n\nBut at some point, an American administration needed to shift the conversation\naway from hopes for an imagined future China to the realities of the Communist\nParty\u2019s conduct\u2014which is hardly a secret. For the decade and a half prior to\n2017, Republican and Democratic leaders publicly worried about China\u2019s\nunwillingness to play by the rules, but were reluctant to deal head on with\nChina\u2019s authoritarian government and statist economy. The bipartisan\n[U.S.-China Economic Security Commission](about:blank) has consistently called\nout China\u2019s unfair practices. In 2010, President Barack Obama lambasted China\nbefore the G-20 for its currency manipulation. The need to compete effectively\nwith the policies of the Chinese Communist Party is one of the few points of\nagreement between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Even as he seeks to\nfind ways to conclude reciprocal trade agreements, his administration has not\nlost sight of China\u2019s aggressive rise.\n\nAt least as controversial as Trump\u2019s critique of China is his emphasis on the\nimportance of sovereignty and his insistence that strong sovereign states are\nthe main agents of change. But states are the foundation of democratic\ngovernance and, fundamentally, of security. It is the citizens of states who\nvote and hold leaders accountable. And it is states that are the foundation of\nmilitary, political, and economic power in alliances such as NATO, or\norganizations like the United Nations.\n\nTrump\u2019s emphasis on protecting U.S. sovereignty brought to a boil a simmering\nnational debate about the overlooked costs of globalization. A blind adherence\nto what the economist Dani Rodrik has called \u201chyper-globalization\u201d _\u2014_ the\n[idea](https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/have-we-reached-peak-\nglobalization) that the interests of big corporations and the principle of\nmarket integration took precedence over widely shared prosperity and economic\nsecurity\u2014had come at the expense of domestic industries. For years, people who\ncomplained about these consequences were dismissed as isolationists or as\nbeing on \u201c[the wrong side of\nhistory](https://www.ft.com/content/6d339f8c-7a2e-11e8-8e67-1e1a0846c475).\u201d\n\n[Peter Beinart: ](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-\nchina-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/)[Trump\u2019s break with China has deadly\nconsequences](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-\nchina-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/)\n\nThe coronavirus experience demonstrates that economic interaction does not\noccur in a vacuum of geopolitical competition. Dependence on China for crucial\nmedical equipment throughout the pandemic has illuminated the dangers of a\nhyper-globalized economy. [Experts](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-dependence-\npharmaceutical-products-china) had warned of American dependence on key drug\ningredients from China. _The Wall Street Journal_ has reported that [China is\nthe only maker of key ingredients](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-\nslows-drug-production-in-china-the-worlds-\npharmacy-11582900885?mod=article_inline) for certain classes of drugs,\nincluding established antibiotics that treat a range of bacterial infections\nsuch as pneumonia. American reliance on Chinese suppliers for other\npharmaceuticals and medical supplies is [also\nworrisome](https://www.uscc.gov/hearings/exploring-growing-us-reliance-chinas-\nbiotech-and-pharmaceutical-products). Americans should not depend on an\nauthoritarian rival state for its citizens\u2019 health\u2014any more than the United\nStates and other free and open societies should give Chinese companies, and by\nextension the Chinese Communist Party, control over communications\ninfrastructure and sensitive personal data.\n\nMany of President Trump\u2019s critics in the foreign-policy community put great\nstock in the ability of multilateral and international organizations to\nconstrain the misbehavior of China and other states. These organizations, at\ntheir best, promote concerted action against commonly recognized problems. But\nTrump\u2019s critics tend to view them mainly in their idealized form and as the\ncentral instruments to solve global problems and advance values shared by all.\nIn practice, though, how international organizations perform is profoundly\ninfluenced by power relationships among member states.\n\nChina\u2019s leaders have become quite skillful at using these bodies to pursue\ntheir own interests. President Xi Jinping has made it a\n[priority](about:blank)\u2014as he put it in a 2018 speech\u2014to \u201creform\u201d and lead in\nthe \u201cglobal governance system,\u201d viewing such efforts as integral to \u201cbuilding\na modern, strong socialist country.\u201d Despite its record of stealing patented\ntechnologies, China tried to lead the World Intellectual Property\nOrganization, an effort thwarted by Washington. Chinese tech companies have\nalso sought to induce the United Nations to adopt their [facial-\nrecognition](https://www.techinasia.com/chinese-tech-firms-shaping-facial-\nrecognition-standards) and [surveillance](https://www.axios.com/facial-\nrecognition-china-un-standards-itu-585838b3-7b24-467b-8097-dbc81bf18117.html)\nstandards, to clear the way for the deployment of their technologies around\nthe world.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s National Security Strategy challenged the\nassumption that international organizations are always driven by a common\nglobal good. China\u2019s undue influence in key international organizations was\nevident most recently, when the World Health Organization hesitated to declare\nCOVID-19 a public-health emergency of international concern. WHO officials\n[amplified Chinese officials\u2019 early claims](https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-\nhaunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/)\nthat the virus posed no danger of human-to-human transmission. The head of the\norganization even congratulated China\u2019s top leadership for its \u201copenness to\nsharing information.\u201d Apparently seeking to avoid Beijing\u2019s wrath, the WHO\nrefused to respond to [Taiwan\u2019s early\nconcerns](https://asiatimes.com/2020/03/who-refused-to-act-on-taiwans-virus-\nalert/) about human-to-human transmission of the virus outbreak in Wuhan.\n\nThe COVID-19 experience, although far from over, has generated strong evidence\nthat, while the WHO and other international organizations are of course\nimportant for information sharing and coordination, nations continue to do the\nheavy lifting. The United States remains the largest contributor to the WHO,\npaying [about 15 percent of the organization\u2019s\nbudget](http://open.who.int/2018-19/contributors/contributor)\u2014compared with\nChina\u2019s 0.21 percent. In early March, Trump signed a supplemental\nappropriations act that included $1.3 billion in additional U.S. foreign\nassistance for pandemic response. Most recently, Secretary of State Mike\nPompeo [announced](https://www.state.gov/secretary-michael-r-pompeo-remarks-\nto-the-press-7/) an additional $274 million in emergency funding for at-risk\ncountries. This aid does not come with the strings that China attaches to its\naid.\n\nContrary to what critics argue, \u201cAmerica first\u201d does not mean \u201cAmerica alone.\u201d\nThat Trump might be introducing needed correctives to the hyper-globalization\npursued by earlier administrations is generating serious cognitive dissonance\nin some quarters. And the reality is that only one organization in the entire\nworld has as its sole responsibility the American people\u2019s safety. That\ninstitution is the U.S. government. Whether led by Republicans or Democrats\u2014or\nby Donald Trump or anyone else\u2014it should always put the American people first.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Marcello al Corso church, in\nfront of a crucifix that in 1552 was carried in a procession around Rome to\nstop the great plague. VATICAN MEDIA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is likely to be a watershed event in world history,\nwith a deep impact on society, politics, and religions. One can expect the\nrise of new messianic movements, for example, with some claiming that the\npandemic is a sign that the apocalypse is coming, as some\n[already](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-apocalypse-\nreligion.html) believe. Conversely, some believers may lose their faith,\nbecause they struggle with the age-old \u201cproblem of evil\u201d\u2014why God would allow\nall this to happen\u2014and find no good answer to it, as some\n[frankly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-\nreligion.html) admit.\n\nMany religious people will also see the pandemic as a test. They are\nabsolutely right: The coronavirus pandemic is a major test for all religions.\nBut it is a test of not merely their faith, as many believers typically think.\nIt is also a test of their reason\u2014whether they act rationally or irrationally,\nwhether they help save lives or put them at grave risk.\n\nAt the heart of this test is a conflict between the rational requirements of\nhealth and the traditional requirements of religion. Rational health-conscious\nbehavior, as advised by virtually all medical experts, requires social\ndistancing\u2014namely, that people stay away from each other, preferably at home.\nMost religious traditions, however, require social gathering\u2014especially\nbringing the faithful to churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples. So, which\nof these principles should come first?\n\nThe right answer should not be too difficult to find, as many religious\nleaders and communities have done since the emergence of the pandemic in late\nFebruary. The Catholic Church, for example,\n[responded](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2020-03/church-state-in-\nitaly-cooperate-to-halt-spread-of-coronavirus.html) to the deadly outbreak in\nItaly in early March by suspending all communal church services, \u201cin\ncoordination with the measures launched by the Italian authorities.\u201d Soon\nafter, Pope Francis prayed to a stunningly [empty St. Peter\u2019s\nSquare](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/03/28/coronavirus-pope-\nfrancis-prays-empty-vatican-st-peters-square/2932690001/), which is typically\nfilled by huge crowds. He also\n[called](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/03/29/pope-francis-warns-\nviral-genocide-if-governments-put-economy-people-amid) on the governments of\nthe world to put \u201cpeople first\u201d and to take all the measures against a \u201cviral\ngenocide.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Saudi authorities, whose responses to disasters have at times been\n[irrationally fatalistic](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/islams-\ntragic-fatalism.html), took the right step in early March by [closing the two\nholy mosques](https://time.com/5796035/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-iran-islam-\nmecca/) in Mecca and Medina, which are always swarmed by worshippers. Seeing\nthe stunning photos of the [empty\nKaaba](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-mosques-\nmecca-medina) convinced many Muslims around the world that something really\nunprecedented was going on. In many Muslim-majority nations, one after\nanother, communal prayers were [called\noff](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/coronavirus-\nmuslims-worship-200323103115512.html). Even the call to prayer issued from\nmosque loudspeakers, which includes the line, \u201ccome to prayer, come to\nsalvation,\u201d was\n[reworded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-\nthe-impact-on-islam-video) in Kuwait to say, \u201cpray in your homes.\u201d\n\nIn Orthodox Jewish circles, many rabbis also did the right thing by [calling\noff synagogue](https://www.timesofisrael.com/british-chief-rabbi-orders-\nsynagogues-closed-over-coronavirus/) services and reminding their communities,\nthe \u201cTorah obligation to protect the sanctity of life transcends all other\nconsiderations,\u201d as Britain\u2019s chief rabbi reminded the country\u2019s Jews. Many\n[Hindu\ntemples](https://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/nation/2020/mar/19/covid-19-impact-\nhere-are-the-temples-in-india-that-have-been-shut-down-102803.html) were\nclosed down in India. In Thailand, one of the worst-hit countries in Southeast\nAsia, some [Buddhist\nmonks](https://www.thejakartapost.com/seasia/2020/03/24/thai-monks-make-virus-\nmasks-from-recycled-plastic.html) began producing face masks from recycled\nplastic.\n\nHowever, not all religious leaders and communities have taken such rational\nprecautions against the pandemic. Some even rejected them in the name of\nfaith.\n\nOne was Rodney Howard-Browne, the pastor of a large evangelical church in\nFlorida, who defied the state\u2019s public orders for social distancing,\n[claiming](https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-rodney-howard-browne-florida-\npastor-pansies-1492460) that his church was \u201cthe safest place.\u201d (Soon, he got\n[arrested](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/us/florida-pastor-arrested-river-\nchurch/index.html) for doing so.) Another one was Jerry Falwell Jr., who\n[dismissed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jerry-falwell-jrs-\ncoronavirus-response-shows-his-staggering-level-of-\nignorance/2020/03/30/9138ae4c-72af-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html) the\nnationwide response to the pandemic as an \u201coverreaction\u201d and reopened his\nLiberty University after the spring break. (Soon after, many students [tested\npositive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/politics/coronavirus-liberty-\nuniversity-falwell.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytpolitics) for the coronavirus.)\nAnother reckless Christian leader was Majdi Allawi of the Maronite Catholic\nChurch in Lebanon, who reportedly dismissed protective measures such as\nwearing masks and using hand sanitizer. \u201cJesus is my protection,\u201d he\n[said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/world/middleeast/coronavirus-\nreligion.html), \u201cHe is my sanitizer.\u201d\n\nSome ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have also been dangerously reckless. In\nthe New York borough of Brooklyn, many members of the Hasidic community\ndisregarded social distancing and gathered for Purim celebrations and\nreligious weddings and funerals as the virus shut down the city in March.\nSeveral of those communities soon\n[showed](https://www.jta.org/2020/04/02/united-states/brooklyns-orthodox-\nneighborhoods-have-especially-high-rates-of-coronavirus) high rates of\ncoronavirus infection. In Israel, some ultra-Orthodox leaders resisted the\ngovernment\u2019s calls for closing of yeshivas, where students study religious\ntexts, [insisting](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Coronavirus-Israels-ultra-\nOrthodox-endanger-the-public-opinion-623249), \u201ccanceling Torah study is more\ndangerous than corona.\u201d Consequently, Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox, who make up\nabout 10 percent of the national population, [have accounted for half of all\nIsraelis](https://www.timesofisrael.com/around-half-of-israelis-hospitalized-\nwith-coronavirus-are-ultra-orthodox-tv/) hospitalized for coronavirus\ninfection.\n\nIn the Muslim world, too, there have been disastrously naive reactions to the\npandemic. One of the most dramatic cases was that of the Tablighi Jamaat, an\nIndia-based Sunni missionary movement with as many as 80 million members\naround the world. Despite all the warnings, they held huge dayslong\ngatherings, first in [Kuala\nLumpur](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/malaysia-mosque-event-virus-\nhotspot-se-asia-200318021302367.html), Malaysia, and then in [New\nDelhi](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tablighi-\njamaat-case-story-behind-the-covid-hotspot-that-set-cops-on-a-frantic-\nnationwide-hunt/articleshow/74947692.cms), soon proving to be a \u201c[super-\nspreader](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-\ntablighi-jamaat-delhi/2020/04/02/abdc5af0-7386-11ea-\nad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html)\u201d of the virus in South and Southeast Asia. (The\nincident led some Hindu nationalists to spew religious hatred and blame\nMuslims for a\n[#coronajihad](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronaJihad?src=hashtag_click),\nwhich became a trending hashtag on Twitter. But it was not a malicious\nconspiracy\u2014just like the case of the [Shincheonji Church of Jesus of South\nKorea](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-south-korea-cults-\nconservatives-china/), which also acted as super spreader, it was simply\ncatastrophic carelessness.)\n\nIn the mainstream Sunni and Shiite world, rational precautions have been taken\nby most governments, but often belatedly, and despite resistance from the most\ndogmatic believers. In Iran, one of the worst-affected countries, when\nauthorities finally banned people from Shiite shrines, angry crowds\n[stormed](https://time.com/5804546/iran-shiite-storm-coronavirus/) them. In\nPakistan, where [most clerics\nrefused](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/asia/pakistan-coronavirus-\ntablighi-jamaat.html) to limit mosque gatherings, police officers who tried to\ndisperse crowds from Friday prayers [were\nstoned](https://twitter.com/zalmayzia/status/1246015911930232833?s=20) by\nfurious worshippers.\n\nAnd in the United Kingdom, some conservative Muslim scholars also resisted the\nclosure of mosques. A [March 17\nfatwa](https://islamicportal.co.uk/coronavirus-should-masjids-close/) signed\nby three of them made the case by reminding \u201cthe Prophet\u2019s practice of rushing\nto the Masjid [mosque] during calamities,\u201d with a total disregard for the\nspecific kind of a calamity that coronavirus is. They also made a grim\nargument: \u201cThe protection of faith supersedes the protection of one\u2019s self.\u201d\nLuckily, other scholars gave [counter-fatwas](http://nizami.co.uk/should-\nmosques-remain-open-for-congregational-prayer-countering-a-poor-fatwa/),\nreminding that Islam never commands that people \u201cplace their lives in danger\u201d\njust for the sake of prayer\u2014but some damage may have already been done.\n\nThe religious figures who are failing the coronavirus test come from diverse\ntraditions, but they have something in common: They prioritize their\nsubjective interpretation of faith over the objective requirements of science\nand reason. They believe that, even if there is really something dangerous\nhappening, God will somehow protect them thanks to their piety. A typical line\nof thought is that \u201cpraying to God is our only way out of this ordeal,\u201d as one\nArabic teacher in Egypt [said](https://www.al-\nmonitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/egyptians-further-depressed-by-closed-\nchurches-mosques.html#ixzz6IZCm9q5W). Or they believe God \u201cis our shield,\u201d as\nan ultra-Orthodox Jew in Brooklyn\n[asserted](https://www.amny.com/brooklyn/despite-coronavirus-jewish-residents-\nin-brooklyn-choose-to-celebrate-purim-together/). This is akin to jumping from\na flying plane, without a parachute, saying, \u201cGod is our parachute.\u201d It is the\nkind of blind faith that prominent atheists such as Richard Dawkins or Sam\nHarris have long been criticizing.\n\nBlind faith gets even uglier when it begins embracing divine conspiracy\ntheories\u2014the idea that God is using this pandemic to punish a certain group of\npeople, which are typically the people the divine conspiracy theorists don\u2019t\nlike: [gay people and environmentalists](https://www.the-\nsun.com/news/589777/donald-trump-ralph-dollinger-coronavirus-bible-study-\nminister/), according to an American evangelical minister; those who pursue\n\u201c[adultery and anal sex](https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-coronavirus/political-\nislam-jeopardises-turkeys-fight-against-coronavirus),\u201d according to a Turkish\nconservative; the\n[Chinese](https://keralakaumudi.com/en/news/news.php?id=263670&u=islamic-\nscholar-who-proclaimed-coronavirus-is-allahs-punishment-for-china-tests-\npositive-for-covid-19-263670), as some Muslim clerics initially suggested; the\n[Jews](https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/conservative-pastor-says-spread-of-\ncoronavirus-in-synagogues-is-punishment-from-god), as an anti-Semitic Florida\npastor claimed, or [Western\ncountries](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gaza-imam-claims-\nvirus-is-soldier-of-allah-isnt-hitting-palestinians-muslims/), as an imam in\nGaza asserted. The very fact some of these bigoted figures themselves catch\nthe virus hints that there is not a divine conspiracy\u2014but perhaps a divine\nirony.\n\nIf such irrational and ugly attitudes keep clouding the religious scene, the\ncoronavirus pandemic may usher in a secular moment, as the Turkish academic\nGokhan Bacik already [foresees](https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-\ncoronavirus/coronavirus-pandemic-strengthens-secular-outlook-islamic-world) in\nthe Muslim world. The closest historical analogy would be [Great Lisbon\nEarthquake of 1755](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/earthquake-\ntakes-heavy-toll-on-lisbon), which killed as many as 50,000 people and\nshattered the supernaturalist Catholic narratives of the era.\n\nTo avoid what will appear to many as a catastrophic failure of their\nworldview, religious leaders must get their act together . That means offering\nfaith as a source of hope and inspiration\u2014not as a substitute, but a\nsupplement to reason.\n\nDespite the clerics\u2019 tendency to tie natural disasters to sins, the earthquake\nhappened on All Saints\u2019 Day, exactly when churches were filled with\nworshippers, many of whom perished. The drama inspired Enlightenment thinkers\nsuch as Immanuel Kant, who argued for scientific explanations to natural\nphenomena, and Voltaire, who took the secular lesson to an anti-religious\npassion.\n\nTo avoid what will appear to many as another catastrophic failure of their\nworldview, religious leaders around the world must get their act together\ntoday in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. That means following all the\nrational requirements of science, while offering faith as a source of hope and\ninspiration\u2014not as a _substitute_ , but a _supplement_ to reason.\n\nFor Muslims\u2014and other believers of all faiths\u2014a simple story from the life of\nthe Prophet Mohammed may help. The prophet was once\n[supposedly](https://abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2012/11/17/trust-\nallah-tie-your-camel/) asked by a man, \u201cO Messenger of God, should I tie my\ncamel and trust in God, or should I leave her untied and trust in God?\u201d\n\n\u201cTie her,\u201d the prophet reportedly replied, \u201cand trust in God.\u201d\n\nToday, tying the camel means wearing masks, washing your hands often with\nsoap, keeping your distance from others, and giving up on communal worship to\nprotect human life as the God of all monotheistic religions commands. It means\nbeing attentive to all the natural laws and biological facts of the complex\nworld that God has created.

The person described the proposal on the condition of\nanonymity because the draft had not been finalized.\n\nThe new policy is aimed in particular at workers in critical jobs. But it also\ncomes as the Trump administration is eyeing what it calls a \u201cstabilization\u201d in\ninfection rates and looks toward rolling back some of the restrictive social-\ndistancing guidelines and restarting the nation\u2019s stalled economy.\n\nThe proposed guidance would follow recommendations made by the CDC that eased\nself-isolation requirements for front-line medical workers who were exposed to\nthe virus. Under CDC guidance, medical workers who have been exposed to the\nvirus without protective equipment but who have no symptoms can return to work\nwith a mask and temperature checks after 14 days.\n\nPence on Tuesday said the White House is focusing on the \u201cpoint of need\u201d for\nthe current situation but is also operating on another track to consider\nfuture recommendations for the public.\n\n\u201cSome of the best minds here at the White House are beginning to think about\nwhat recommendations will look like that we give to businesses, that we give\nto states, but it will all, I promise you, be informed on putting the health\nand well-being of the American people first,\u201d Pence said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as\nfever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially\nolder adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more\nsevere illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nIn fashioning the recommendations, the administration appeared to be trying to\nbalance political concerns about wanting to preserve as much normalcy as\npossible with public health concerns that some infections are being spread by\npeople who seem to be healthy.\n\n###  Read Next\n\n[ ![Read full story](https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-\nHY171_moneyi_ZU_20200110114131.jpg) ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-\nboss-says-coronavirus-is-a-political-conspiracy-and-told-me-to-work-despite-\nthe-fact-that-i-was-just-tested-for-covid-19-2020-04-08?mod=nextup_bomw)\n\n###  Read Next\n\n###  [My boss says coronavirus is a political conspiracy and told me to work,\ndespite the fact that I was just tested for\nCOVID-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-boss-says-coronavirus-is-a-\npolitical-conspiracy-and-told-me-to-work-despite-the-fact-that-i-was-just-\ntested-for-covid-19-2020-04-08?mod=nextup_bomw)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m falling through the cracks.

people first': Boston grocery store workers hold protest in response\nto coronavirus exposure, lack of protection\n\n[John Cuoco](https://whdh.com/author/john-cuoco/ \"Posts by John Cuoco\")\n\nBOSTON (WHDH) - Grocery store workers in Boston held a protest on Tuesday\nmorning to demand more protection from their employers as the number of\n[coronavirus](https://whdh.com/?s=coronavirus) cases and deaths-linked to the\nhighly contagious disease continues to climb on a daily basis.\n\n\"Hey, hey! We need hazard pay! Ho, ho!\" a frightened and frustrated grocery\nworker could be heard yelling into a megaphone.\n\nDozens of workers from Shaw's, Stop & Shop, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's\nlined the sidewalk outside of the Whole Foods in the city's South End.\n\n\"We are demanding adequate personal protective equipment and time-and-half\nhazard pay for the duration of the crisis,\" protestor Elan Axelbank said.\n\nMany workers could be seen holding a bright sign with bold messages demanding\naction.\n\n\"Protect the front line, not the bottom line,\" one worker's sign said.\n\nOther workers told 7NEWS that they are worried sick and fearful that they will\ncatch the virus and never recover.\n\n\"We're essential employees but we're people first,\" Lisa Wilson said. \"I feel\nlike they forgot that a long time ago. Now is definitely time to remember\nthat.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Karyn Polito announced Tuesday that the state is limiting the number\nof people who can go into a grocery store at one time.\n\n\"We are issuing guidance that will say 40 percent of the occupancy, and that\noccupancy will include both employees and customers,\" she explained.\n\nIn a statement obtained by 7NEWS, Whole Foods said they will be providing\ntheir employees with gloves and masks, in addition to paying them an extra $2\nper hour.\n\nA Stop & Shop spokesperson said they're implementing extra precautions,\nincluding placing signage in stores reminding customers to stand at least six\nfeet apart, putting tape on the floor near each register that shows the\nrecommended distance, and making aisles go in one direction only in all\nMassachusetts stores.\n\nWorkers argue these guidelines are not being followed as well as they should\nbe.\n\n\"They'll put the tape down, and they'll put signs and things like that. But as\nfar as actually enforcing it and making sure that, you know, people are\nstaying a certain amount of feet apart, and things are getting cleaned and\nsanitized as much as they should, that's not really happening,\" Wilson said.\n\n**[Click here for more coronavirus\ncoverage.](https://whdh.com/?s=coronavirus)**\n\n _(Copyright (c) 2020 Sunbeam Television.

catastrophe for aviation, dwarfing the economic\neffects of the Great Recession and 9/11 _combined_. Our industry will collapse\nin weeks without government help. To save aviation\u2014and every other sector of\nour economy\u2014we need to make sure paychecks and benefits keep flowing for as\nmany working people as possible.\n\nThe union that I lead, the Association of Flight Attendants\u2013CWA, represents\n50,000 flight attendants across 20 airlines. And we have a plan to help\naviation workers, and to rein in the worst corporate behavior in the process.\n\nOur proposal isn\u2019t a repeat of past bailouts\u2014such as the 2008 bank rescue or\nthe airline bailouts after 9/11\u2014in which Big Business got billions and working\npeople had to beg for scraps. This is a rescue plan that puts people first.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason to start with aviation, but there\u2019s no good reason to\nstop there. We can expand this approach to other sectors of the economy, in\norder to keep those who are able to care for themselves strong, so we can\nfocus on fighting the virus and helping the most vulnerable.\n\n[Annie Lowrey: This is not a recession. It\u2019s an ice\nage.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/quantifying-coming-\nrecession/608443/)\n\nAviation is a cornerstone of our economy. We move millions of people and\nbillions of dollars in cargo every day, and our industry supports jobs in\nevery sector of our economy. We need our industry to be ready to fly as soon\nas the all-clear is sounded by public-health officials.\n\nBut that won\u2019t be possible if workers are laid off or furloughed indefinitely.\nFederal law requires ongoing training, licensing, and security clearances for\nmost aviation workers\u2014including flight attendants, pilots, and mechanics, but\nalso airport-security workers and those who clean and service the planes and\nterminals. If workers are laid off, and those clearances and qualifications\nlapse, it could take months or even years to return to full capacity, creating\na bottleneck that will cut off economic recovery for other industries long\nafter the threat from COVID-19 has passed.\n\nWashington is preparing to step in. But no-strings-attached corporate bailouts\nwon\u2019t help workers today, and they will slow down our recovery when the\nimmediate crisis passes.\n\nWhen an accident occurs in aviation, our industry, our unions, and our\ngovernment work together to stop it from happening again. That\u2019s what we need\nto do now\u2014with a people-first model.\n\nIt starts with our jobs. We\u2019re asking the government to provide grants that\nkeep every aviation worker on payroll, with full pay and benefits, for the\nduration of the crisis. A paycheck means we can feed our families, but it also\nmeans we can keep our training and clearance current so we\u2019re ready to return\nto work the minute we get the call.\n\nOur industry also needs help to keep our fleets maintained and the system\nrunning, through direct government loans. But this can\u2019t be another chance for\nexecutives to line their own pockets or funnel profits to Wall Street.\n\nOne big reason the airlines are in so much trouble is that over the past 10\nyears, they\u2019ve spent 96 percent of their free cash on buybacks to juice their\nstock prices, rather than saving for the future. Aviation unions fought these\nbuybacks. We warned that it would leave the airlines exposed in a downturn,\nand we were right. We can\u2019t allow that behavior to endanger our industry, our\njobs, and our economy again.\n\nThat\u2019s why our proposal includes a ban on stock buybacks as a condition of any\nloans to the aviation industry. At the same time, we\u2019re asking Congress to\nimpose strict prohibitions on dividends and executive bonuses as part of any\nrelief package.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Companies must agree to honor all existing collective-\nbargaining agreements. And any company that files for bankruptcy as a result\nof this crisis must be required to put workers first in bankruptcy.\n\nThis approach works uniquely well for major employers\u2014airlines, yes, but also\nhospitality businesses, manufacturers, and automakers, and firms in many more\nindustries that are in deep trouble today. By using direct grants to keep\nworkers on payroll, we can save millions of workers. Small businesses, gig\nworkers, freelancers, artists, and others will also need a strong safety net\nin the weeks and months to come; helping them will require other approaches,\nto supplement these efforts.\n\nWe need major help to save our economy. Let\u2019s start by saving as many jobs as\nwe can by using federal funds to keep people on payroll and ready to return to\nwork.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Ordinary people must be rescued now.\nMillions around the world are already feeling the pain of layoffs and reduced\nworking hours.\n\nPlummeting oil prices, the lowest since 2013, are telling us that industry\nglobally is retrenching. Already last year, the U.S. manufacturing sector was\nin recession primarily due Trump\u2019s trade war. Sharply declining oil prices\nwill be particularly adverse for countries in the Middle East, the Former\nSoviet Union, Nigeria, Venezuela, and to a lesser extent Mexico, which\ntreasuries are so dependent on oil revenues. The International Energy Agency\nrecently announced that this oil price collapse could cut revenues for\nsensitive oil producing countries by as much as 85%. We have enough historical\nevidence that shows that when oil prices get this low, there will be\nsignificant [geopolitical and social upheaval](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/06/Falling-Oil-Prices-English.pdf\n\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Falling-Oil-Prices-\nEnglish.pdf\"),  possibly even a collapse, such as when the Soviet Union\ndissolved in 1991.\n\n![Oil prices are collapsing.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e7392af10380d0006bd9b32/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nOil prices collapsing tell us that industry is seriously retrenching.\n\nOilPrices.com\n\nToday In: [Banking & Insurance](https://www.forbes.com/banking-insurance)\n\n  * [\n\n### KKR Billionaires Henry Kravis And George Roberts Create $50 Million\nCoronavirus Relief Fund\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/04/07/kkr-billionaires-henry-\nkravis-and-george-roberts-create-50-million-coronavirus-relief-fund/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Bankers Warn Of Challenges Ahead For Economy, Call For More Action\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/04/06/bankers-warn-of-\nchallenges-ahead-for-economy-call-for-more-action/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How Tracy Maitland Built A $9 Billion Firm To Beat This Bear Market\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/04/05/how-tracy-maitland-\nbuilt-a-9-billion-firm-to-beat-this-bear-market/)\n\nIt is not surprising that JP Morgan just changed its global GDP projections\nand now anticipates a 14% decline in GDP for the second quarter of this year.\nThis is just a quarterly view, and it is subject to revisions.\n\n![JP Morgan has significantly reduced its GDP expectations.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e7392f610380d0006bd9b45/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nJPMorgan GDP forecast revisions should be eye opening to all of us.\n\nJPMorgan\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated earlier this week that\nunemployment could hit 20%. Yet, economist Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics\nputs the figure as high as [50%](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/economy/job-\nlosses-coronavirus/index.html \"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/economy/job-\nlosses-coronavirus/index.html\"). It will take a few months to see the true\nextent of unemployment. Today\u2019s jobless claims, an important economic leading\nindicator, tells us that the eventual unemployment number will be brutal.\nFilings for U.S. unemployment benefits, a leading economic indicator, last\nweek already surged to a two-year high as the Covid-19 pandemic forced\nemployers to start laying off workers. Labor Department data show that jobless\nclaims rose by 70,000 to 281,000 in the week ended March 14. This is the\nhighest level of claims in 2 years. The four-week moving average of initial\nclaims, considered a key measure of labor market trends, rose by 16,500 to\n232,250 last week. What this report does not cover is that many states'\nwebsites are overwhelmed with benefits' applications; hence thousands of\npeople are struggling to get the benefits that they need now. This will lead\nto late payments and defaults, which will hit credit unions, banks, and other\nlenders. Unfortunately, with key municipalities in New York and California\nputting in place a wide range of restaurant and other business closures and\nshelter in place measures, next weeks benefits claims numbers are expected to\nbe far worse, maybe as high as [2\nmillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/economist-next-week-jobless-claims-\ncould-hit-2-million-on-coronavirus.html\n\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/economist-next-week-jobless-claims-could-\nhit-2-million-on-coronavirus.html\").\n\n![Restaurant traffic has declined precipitously.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e739e7010380d0006bd9de1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nRestaurant traffic has declined precipitously.\n\nS&P Global\n\nWith the above data, what are U.S. Legislators and Trump waiting for?\nAccording to the [Federal\nReserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-\nof-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm\n\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-\nhouseholds-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm\"), over 40% of\nAmericans do not have $400 readily available to meet emergencies.\n\n![40% of Americans do not have $400 in liquidity right now.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e73934c2a573300068fb87d/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\n60% of Americans have $400 right now to pay emergency expenses.

Like Kelleher, I agree that the\nTrump administration is not focusing quickly and correctly enough on ordinary\nAmericans, many of whom have barely recovered from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\u201cThe current focus on aiding companies and industries to stop a wave of\ncorporate bankruptcies is wrong. Preventing airlines, cruise ships, and trains\n_without_  passengers or other companies  _without_  customers from going\nbankrupt is irrelevant right now. Those companies\u2019 fixed costs for leases,\ndebt payments, contractual obligations and many other financial\nresponsibilities are what will push them into bankruptcy. But those costs have\nnothing to do with their employees, who will just be laid off while the\ncorporation pays or restructures its other debts, including executive\ncompensation agreements.\u201d\n\n![Senator Warren recommends that company bailout conditions have to come with\nstringent conditions](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5ba3bf4a6ad440f8b491e33eaab284b2/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nSenator Warren recommends that company bailout conditions have to come with\nstringent conditions\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nYesterday, Senator Warren stated that any company bailout conditions have to\ncome with stringent conditions. She is right! Companies have feasted at the\ntrough of low interest rates for a decade, and benefited greatly from Trump\u2019s\nmisguided tax give away to corporations. It is high time for corporate America\nto take care of our people. Simply firing people shifts their plight to us,\nthe taxpayer.\n\nSpecifically, Senator Warren recommends that,\n\n  * Payrolls must be maintained and companies must use funds to keep people working or on payroll\n  * $15 minimum wage within one year of the end of the national emergency\n  * Permanent ban on share buybacks\n  * No dividends or executive bonuses while receiving relief and for three years afterwards\n  * Must obtain shareholder and board approval for all political spending\n  * Collective bargaining agreements should remain in place\n\nKelleher also advised that \u201cAny company that gets public aid must also help\nitself by not wasting its limited cash on share buybacks or dividends, which\nall must be suspended for at least the duration of the crisis.\u201d Executives are\nunlikely to like that he also rightly advises that \u201cexecutive compensation and\nbonuses must be limited to reasonable amounts.\u201d I hope that we learned from\nthe financial crisis from a decade ago. We absolutely cannot afford another\nno-strings bailout like what the government did for Wall Street.  Ordinary\nAmericans rescued banks and shortly thereafter in 2009, bankers paid\nthemselves $22 billion in bonuses.\n\nLegislators must use trillions of dollars to bailout ordinary Americans and\nthey need to set-up very strict oversight of any taxpayers funds that end up\ngoing to companies. Kelleher strongly recommends that employer have to pay\nwages and tips immediately. \u201cThis must be done first and fast, along with\ntransparency, accountability and public oversight. Otherwise, social and\npolitical upheaval if not chaos are just weeks away.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrvassociates/).

It\u2019s about working swiftly to\nensure whole teams have a device for home working and that laptops are set up\nwith the right software, security and permissions,\n[VPN](https://www.techradar.com/sg/vpn/best-vpn) structures are enabled and\nrobust enough to handle multiple users at any given time. Infrastructure,\n[back-ups](https://www.techradar.com/sg/best/best-cloud-backup), upgrades, and\ndata security all suddenly needed to be deployed \u2013 and fast.\n\nThis means that cloud technology is coming into its own like never before.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s set to be critical to business outcomes as this current crisis\nunfolds.\n\n  * Here's our list of the [best video conferencing tools](https://www.techradar.com/sg/best/best-video-conferencing-software) on the market\n  * [Working from home: the mouse, monitor, keyboard and router you need](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/working-from-home-everything-you-need-to-set-up-your-new-home-office)\n  * Here's our choice of the [best business webcams](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-webcam-5-reviewed-and-rated-1027972) of 2020\n\n## Enabling collaboration\n\nWhole organisations are working remotely for the foreseeable future. As the\nsituation develops and we look to return to a new normal, ensuring teams can\nfunction effectively and are on track to meet project goals, will be\nessential. Cloud platforms such as Zoom and Teams increase collaboration and\nhelp to boost productivity and, with global organisations operating across\nmultiple time zones, cloud enabled platforms support additional connectivity.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to bear in mind that the collaboration tools your teams are using\nare supported and covered by security controls. Some apps may not be\nappropriate for the remote working environment, for instance those that\ninvolve high levels of data moving back and forth.\n\n## Cloud hosting supports better workflow management\n\nThere\u2019s a learning curve at play for many teams right now. This brings its own\nlayer of pressure. With the workflow management capability offered by cloud\napplications, concerns such as version control become more manageable\nespecially for teams who aren\u2019t necessarily used to remote working over longer\nperiods of time. It closes the margin for error which, given the high levels\nof anxiety some team members are running with, is simply one less thing to\nworry about. What\u2019s more, it enables retrieving lost data and adds that peace\nof mind. Providers need to boost their back up service, so if anything goes\nwrong, you can rewind, restore and investigate safely.  As well as ensuring\nthat all users benefit from the latest software and security patches, this\ntakes the burden off IT and means there\u2019s no downtime for your employee.\n\nYou may want your IT team to look at 'least privilege\u2019 access too. For bigger\norganisations, not everyone **** needs access to every component or asset.\nKeep things lean by limiting permissions so that everyone has what they need\nto do their jobs. It\u2019s always easier to grant permissions after a user has\nbeen verified than to take away access after a potential compromise.\n\n## Increased security for both your business and your team\n\nCloud deployments provide a more secure platform for data, files and shared\nprojects. For your team, this means enhanced data management and improved\naccess when working on multiple projects.\n\nThe cloud provides that strong layer of security for data accessed remotely as\ncloud suppliers will build basic controls into their services, and typically\noffer additional security options, as well as a high level of support. Cloud-\nbased apps and data are accessed through a remote virtualised desktop\nenvironment that exists centrally within the provider\u2019s infrastructure, which\nmeans no data is shared with the employee\u2019s device or laptop.\n\n## Be mindful of communication squeezes\n\nAs the global remote working population reaches unprecedented levels,\norganisations will have to reassess network and application design \u2013 the\ndemand levels will also lead to crunch points. Both network and cloud\narchitecture needs to be efficiently managed to avoid impacting performance \u2013\nespecially in these overloaded times. One solution is to manage blocks of\nonline time for different teams to ease any infrastructure pressures and avoid\nincreasing the load on IT.\n\n## Keep it people-first\n\nNow more than ever, tech leaders need to own a people-first strategy. Your own\nteam will be feeling the pressure as well as their own anxiety around the\nwider issue. There\u2019s also a chance some of the team may be unwell or need to\nself-isolate, which is why it\u2019s essential to have the tech in place to build\nand sustain relationships. Using\n[videoconferencing](https://www.techradar.com/sg/best/best-video-conferencing-\nsoftware) and [collaboration tools](https://www.techradar.com/sg/best/best-\nonline-collaboration-tools) will help teams to connect on a human level,\ngiving them that much needed connection and wellbeing check-in.\n\nCloud is at the heart of all effective remote working strategies, helping you\nto foster an agile, cohesive and productive workforce in these unsettling\ntimes. Ultimately, it enhances employee experience too and helps build team\ncollaboration, confidence and trust. The question to consider is, once we\u2019ve\nseen what\u2019s possible in this new normal, what happens in the longer term?  \n\nWhen this passes, our people will still in thrive from in-person contact -\ntechnology is years away from giving a truly authentic experience of this.\nWhile the future of the workspace will have been transformed by Covid-19, and\nbusiness\u2019 flexible and remote working strategies accelerated, not even the\ncloud will replace human connection.\n\n _Ed Butler is CEO at_[ _Amito_](https://www.amito.com/)\n\n  * Here's our list of the [best online collaboration tools](https://www.techradar.com/sg/best/best-online-collaboration-tools) around\n\n[See more Computing news ](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/computing)\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

These 12 countries set a standard on what governments could provide\nfor workers that need to be emulated by many more governments around the\nworld. There are still significant gaps in some of the countries and the\nunions are pressing for these gaps to be filled,\" said Sharan Burrow, ITUC\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe ITUC has identified five demands which will have the most direct impact on\nworking people -paid sick leave, wage support and income support for\nfreelancers, self-employed workers, gig economy workers, as well as loan\nrelief for rent or mortgage payments and free health care.\n\n\"These measures are a start - but implementation with fast payments is key. A\npandemic with no known end date will mean more support is needed for working\npeople. The health, social and economic consequences of COVID-19 will require\nnew levels of care, of social protection and of economic stimulus in all\ncountries. It will take a new social contract,\" said Sharan Burrow.\n\nTwo countries in the Americas region, Argentina and Canada, have put in place\nincome support for self-employed workers. Argentina is offering the self-\nemployed 10,000 pesos (US$157) for April. On Friday evening Uruguay announced\nsimilar measures and food baskets in April and May for low income families and\nan increase in funds and extension of unemployment pay.\n\nIn Europe, eight governments Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,\nNorway, Sweden and the UK made the list. Even though there is more to do in\nsome of these countries the European social model and dialogue with social\npartners has led to fast responses in many countries.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore and New Zealand have provided extensive\nincome and wage support for all categories of workers.\n\nWhile these governments set a pathway for others to follow, unions remain\ngravely concerned for the impact of the measures needed to constrain the virus\nin India where 94% of workers are in the informal economy. Unions have been\ncalling for serious measures and some support for these workers has been\nprovided but much more needs to be done. All workers, but informal workers in\nparticular are in need of income support, distribution of rations and loan\nrelief. The government has begun to respond to union concerns however the\nresponse has still been insufficient.\n\n\"The positive responses to the pandemic demonstrated by these 12 countries\nhave been the result either of strong tripartite or social dialogue structures\nor traditions, or concerted and successful campaigning and lobbying by trade\nunions. The involvement of unions representing working people is key to\nensuring that governments act to put people first in the response to COVID-19.\nThe ITUC is urging other governments to follow these examples and involve\nunions in designing the economic responses urgently needed as the world\nresponds to the pandemic,\" said Sharan Burrow.\n\n**Categories:** [Economy](/economy), [Health & Science](/health-science),\n[Politics](/politics), [Argentina](/argentina),\n[International](/international).\n\n**Tags:** [Argentina](/tags/argentina), [coronaviris](/tags/coronaviris),\n[COVID-19](/tags/covid-19), [ITUC](/tags/ituc), [virus](/tags/virus).\n\n### Top Comments\n\n[Disclaimer & comment\nrules](javascript:popup\\(commentsRules,'','fast',true,'#close-popup',460\\);)\n\n  * ![](/data/cache/usuarios/30903/65x75/emassotheadshot-2-.jpg) Enrique Massot\n\nWhen push comes to shove, states become more necessary than ever to co-\nordinate response measures.  \n  \nKey measures, according to the ITUC, are paid sick leave, wage support and\nincome support for workers, as well as loan relief for rent or mortgage\npayments and free health care.  \n  \nArgentina narrowly escaped a very different fate thanks to the electors'\nchoice last October, when they kicked out \u0093business-friendly\u0094 Macri out of\noffice after a single, disastrous four-year term.  \n  \nNewly elected president Alberto Fernandez, who inherited a wrecked economy,\nhas been widely praised for imposing strict measures to contain the spread of\nthe coronavirus and for caring for the citizens' lives as his first priority.\nIn comparison, Brazil's response has so far been taken mostly by states, with\npresident Jair Bolsonaro remaining opposed to send workers home -- out of\nworries for the economy.\n\nMar 28th, 2020 - 05:36 pm  -1\n\n[Read all comments](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/03/28/ituc-praises-\nargentina-for-putting-people-first-in-fighting-covid-19/comments)\n\nCommenting for this story is now closed.  \nIf you have a Facebook account, become a fan and comment on our **[Facebook\nPage](http://www.facebook.com/pages/MercoPress-South-Atlantic-News-\nAgency/139220750082)**!\n\n\n\n  * [Follow us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MercoPress/)\n  * [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mercopressnews)\n  * Get our news on your inbox!

Commissioner Chuck Rettig announced the IRS People First\nInitiative to provide immediate relief to help people facing uncertainty over\ntaxes during the health crisis. Highlights of the key actions in the IRS\nPeople First Initiative include:\n\n**Existing Installment Agreements** \u2013For taxpayers under an existing\nInstallment Agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are\nsuspended. Taxpayers who are currently unable to comply with the terms of an\nInstallment Payment Agreement, including a Direct Deposit Installment\nAgreement, may suspend payments during this period if they prefer.\nFurthermore, the IRS will not default any Installment Agreements during this\nperiod. By law, interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n\n![Americans File Their Returns On Tax Day 2019](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e7bb5f0d8e1ae0007b77dd7/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 15: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building stands\non April 15, 2019 in ...

(Photo by Zach\nGibson/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\n**New Installment Agreements** \u2013 The IRS reminds people unable to fully pay\ntheir federal taxes that they can resolve outstanding liabilities by entering\ninto a monthly payment agreement with the IRS. See IRS.gov for further\ninformation.\n\n**Offers in Compromise (OIC)** \u2013 The IRS is taking several steps to assist\ntaxpayers in various stages of the OIC process:\n\n_Pending OIC applications_ \u2013 The IRS will allow taxpayers until July 15 to\nprovide requested additional information to support a pending OIC. In\naddition, the IRS will not close any pending OIC request before July 15, 2020,\nwithout the taxpayer\u2019s consent.\n\nToday In: [Taxes](https://www.forbes.com/taxes)\n\n  * [\n\n### Ask Larry: Will My Social Security Benefits Be Reduced If I Earn $12,000\nThis Year?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/07/ask-larry-will-my-social-\nsecurity-benefits-be-reduced-if-i-earn-12000-this-year/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Free Money For Small Business?

More than 1\nmillion households that haven\u2019t filed tax returns during the last three years\nare actually owed refunds; they still have time to claim these refunds. Many\nshould consider contacting a tax professional to consider various available\noptions since the time to receive such refunds is limited by statute. Once\ndelinquent returns have been filed, taxpayers with a tax liability should\nconsider taking the opportunity to resolve any outstanding liabilities by\nentering into an Installment Agreement or an Offer in Compromise with the IRS\nto obtain a \u201cFresh Start.\u201d See IRS.gov for further information.\n\n**Field Collection Activities** \\- Liens and levies (including any seizures of\na personal residence) initiated by field revenue officers will be suspended\nduring this period. However, field revenue officers will continue to pursue\nhigh-income non-filers and perform other similar activities where warranted.\n\n**Automated Liens and Levies** \u2013 New automatic, systemic liens and levies will\nbe suspended during this period.\n\n**Passport Certifications to the State** **Department** \u2013 IRS will suspend new\ncertifications to the Department of State for taxpayers who are \u201cseriously\ndelinquent\u201d during this period. These taxpayers are encouraged to submit a\nrequest for an Installment Agreement or, if applicable, an OIC during this\nperiod. Certification prevents taxpayers from receiving or renewing passports.\n\n**Private Debt Collection** \u2013 New delinquent accounts will not be forwarded by\nthe IRS to private collection agencies to work during this period.\n\n**Field, Office and Correspondence Audits** \u2013 During this period, the IRS will\ngenerally not start new field, office and correspondence examinations. We will\ncontinue to work refund claims where possible, without in-person contact.\nHowever, the IRS may start new examinations where deemed necessary to protect\nthe government\u2019s interest in preserving the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n_In-Person Meetings_ **-** In-person meetings regarding current field, office\nand correspondence examinations will be suspended. Even though IRS examiners\nwill not hold in-person meetings, they will continue their examinations\nremotely, where possible. To facilitate the progress of open examinations,\ntaxpayers are encouraged to respond to any requests for information they\nalready have received - or may receive - on all examination activity during\nthis period if they are able to do so.\n\n_Unique Situations_ \\- Particularly for some corporate and business taxpayers,\nthe IRS understands that there may be instances where the taxpayers desire to\nbegin an examination while people and records are available and respective\nstaffs have capacity. In those instances when it\u2019s in the best interest of\nboth parties and appropriate personnel are available, the IRS may initiate\nactivities to move forward with an examination \u2014 understanding that COVID-19\ndevelopments could later reduce activities for an agreed period.\n\n_General Requests for Information_ \\- In addition to compliance activities and\nexaminations, the IRS encourages taxpayers to respond to any other IRS\ncorrespondence requesting additional information during this time if possible.\n_ _\n\n**Earned Income Tax Credit and Wage Verification Reviews** \u2013 Taxpayers have\nuntil July 15, 2020, to respond to the IRS to verify that they qualify for the\nEarned Income Tax Credit or to verify their income. These taxpayers are\nencouraged to exercise their best efforts to obtain and submit all requested\ninformation, and if unable to do so, please reach out to the IRS indicating\nthe reason such information is not available. Until July 15, 2020, the IRS\nwill not deny these credits for a failure to provide requested information.\n\n**IRS Appeals Office** \u2013 Appeals employees will continue to work their cases.\nAlthough Appeals is not currently holding in-person conferences with\ntaxpayers, conferences may be held over the telephone or by videoconference.\nTaxpayers are encouraged to promptly respond to any outstanding requests for\ninformation for all cases in the Independent Office of Appeals.\n\n**IRS Statute of Limitations -** The IRS will continue to take steps where\nnecessary to protect all applicable statutes of limitations. In instances\nwhere statute expirations might be jeopardized during this period, taxpayers\nare encouraged to cooperate in extending such statutes. Otherwise, the IRS\nwill issue Notices of Deficiency and pursue other similar actions to protect\nthe interests of the government in preserving such statutes. Where a statutory\nperiod is not set to expire during 2020, the IRS is unlikely to pursue the\nforegoing actions until at least July 15, 2020.\n\nCheck out my [website](http://www.WoodLLP.com).\n\n[![Robert W.\nWood](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73322cc02b364e29381c78fb97104c23?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/\n\"Photo of Robert W.

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing\ncolumnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review.\nFollow her on Twitter [@fridaghitis](http://twitter.com/fridaghitis).

Trump flailed desperately on Twitter, and his Health and Human Services\nSecretary, of all people, raved in support of his boss that the economic\nfundamentals are\n\"[unbelievable](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/trump-coronavirus-\neconomic-fallout.html).\"\n\n![Frida\nGhitis](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)\n\n![Frida Ghitis](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140926162935-frida-ghitis-\nprofile-image-large-169.jpg)\n\nFrida Ghitis\n\nBut the combination of alarming news on the virus -- a [lockdown\n](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/europe/coronavirus-italy-lockdown-\nintl/index.html)of the entire population of Italy, new cases at home and\nabroad, [questions](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/irans-\ncoronavirus-problem-lot-worse-it-seems/607663/) about the veracity of\nstatistics in Iran and the President's admitted\n[aversion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/07/which-is-trump-\nmore-worried-about-coronavirus-numbers-or-coronavirus-patients/) to letting\nthe known US infection numbers rise -- added to Wall Street's anxiety.\n\nInstead of viewing it as a PR crisis, the government should set to work to\nstabilize the economy.\n\nUnlike during the 2008 Great Recession, when the government leaped to assist\nfinancial institutions, the first priority this time should be helping\nindividuals in need. Only then should we help businesses caught in this storm.\n\nRead More\n\nBy now, Trump should be wishing that the Federal Reserve Bank had ignored [his\npressure](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-trump/trump-heaps-\npressure-on-fed-and-its-chairman-powell-to-cut-rates-idUSKCN1VB1I2) to lower\ninterest rates. If rates were higher, the Fed would have much more powerful\nammunition: it would be able to aggressively lower rates, which is the\nstrongest weapon in its arsenal. But that arsenal is much depleted.\n\nIn 2008, the government distributed hundreds of billions of dollars, mostly to\nbail out banks and large corporations. (General Motors was the main\nmanufacturer rescued by the Obama administration.)\n\nWhile most banks survived, close to 10 million homeowners [lost\n](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/12/17/what-we-learned-housing/)their houses\nto foreclosure; millions of people lost their jobs.\n\n[![I live in Kirkland, epicenter of the US outbreak.

We need Trump to take this\nseriously](/2020/03/06/opinions/kirkland-epicenter-coronavirus-outbreak-\nopinion-rowe-finkbeiner/index.html)\n\nThat overwhelming tilt in favor of helping struggling businesses instead of\nsuffering individuals is, in my view, one of the reasons populism gained\nstrength, as demonstrated by elections throughout western democracies in the\n2010s.\n\nThis time, the source of the problem is not a breakdown in the financial\nsystem. This is very different. We now face a major health assault. The\npandemic is not only causing illnesses and straining health care resources, it\nis attacking the economy from a multitude of angles. Manufacturers are facing\nsupply chain disruption, shortages are developing and demand is collapsing.\n\nIt's a supply-and-demand pincer move unlike any we've seen before, made more\nacute by uncertainty over how severe it will be and how long it will last.\n\nThe obvious first order of business is clear: Everyone should have access to\nhealth care right now. It's not only the humane thing to do, it's the smartest\nway to slow the contagion. People who become infected should not fear\nbankruptcy if they go to the doctor. If they do, the epidemic will continue to\nspread.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's new [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/cnn/provoke-\npersuade).\n\nJoin us on [Twitter ](http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and\n[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion)\n\nThat is more important in the US than in any other developed country, because\nthe US has a mind-boggling number of uninsured people. Since Trump came to\noffice, the numbers have been climbing as he tries to dismantle the Affordable\nCare Act, or Obamacare. Millions lost coverage in 2018, bringing the number of\nuninsured to 27.5 million, according to the US Census. (The administration is\nstill in [court](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/upshot/obamacare-lawsuit-\ndelay-sought-trump-republicans.html) trying to end Obamacare.)\n\nIt should go without saying that testing for the virus should be free.\n\nThat's just the start. As economists predict the world may soon plunge into\nrecession, some are promoting a modest[ cash payment\n](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-\nstimulus-11583448500)to every individual to stimulate consumption and help the\nmost vulnerable navigate this crisis. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe government should require businesses to provide paid time off to\nemployees. That is not overreach; it is for the protection of all of us. And\nfor the tens of millions who[ work\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/08/31/57-million-u-s-workers-are-\npart-of-the-gig-economy/#33a59a607118)in the gig economy, who do not get paid\nif they don't work, financial assistance should be made available immediately,\nso that Uber drivers and GrubHub delivery people don't find it necessary to\nkeep working while they're sick, potentially driving the virus from one home\nto another.\n\nBut that's not all. That's the individual side of the coronavirus emergency\npackage.\n\nThe government should help the business sector as well. The Fed is doing what\nit can, injecting cash into the economy, but COVID-19 poses a mortal threat to\nthe travel industry. Authorities are reasonably urging people to avoid cruise\nships; they are [steering people away\n](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/health/coronavirus-older-people-social-\ndistancing/index.html)from air travel and recommending \"social distancing,\"\nwhich means no restaurants, no large public events, no movies.\n\nThe right thing to do is to help the affected industries survive.\n\nIn the midst of an election campaign, we will surely hear complaints about\n\"socialism for businesses,\" but that would be misguided. America should have\nsmart, humane capitalism.\n\nGo ahead, bail out the airlines if they need it. Give a hand to the industries\nthat suffer the harshest blow. Offer low-interest credit to small businesses,\nto restaurants, dry cleaners, landscaping companies.\n\n[![Trump serves up irresponsible and dangerous information on\ncoronavirus](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)![Trump\nserves up irresponsible and dangerous information on\ncoronavirus](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200108154536-trump-for-miller-\noped-large-169.jpg)](/2020/03/08/opinions/coronavirus-trump-misinformation-\ntwitter-obeidallah/index.html)\n\n[Trump serves up irresponsible and dangerous information on\ncoronavirus](/2020/03/08/opinions/coronavirus-trump-misinformation-twitter-\nobeidallah/index.html)\n\nAnd, if the economy does tip into recession, extend unemployment benefits.\nInstead of slashing food stamps and other aid to the poor, as the Trump\nadministration is doing, expand it. Protect workers and support business.\nThat's not just the moral thing to do, all of these measures will help the\neconomy get back on its feet faster.\n\nHow would the government pay for all this?\n\nTrump found it possible to dig a trillion-dollar hole in the budget for a [tax\ncut](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/20/perspectives/trump-tax-cuts/index.html)\nduring good times. That was elective, unnecessary. This is urgent,\nindispensable.\n\nHelp the people; help businesses; give the market system a hand when it's\nabout to stumble.\n\nThis is not a problem that will be solved by blaming the news media as Trump\ndid amid the market selloff.

The 76-day lockdown of the city ends on Wednesday. ZHAO JUN/FOR\nCHINA DAILY\n\n**People's lives, safety, health prioritized in war on COVID-19**\n\nEnding the lockdown of Wuhan, Hubei province, on Wednesday will become a\nmilestone for China in securing final victory in the people's war against the\nCOVID-19 outbreak under the command of President Xi Jinping, observers said.\n\nThe decisive measures that the Communist Party of China Central Committee\uff0dwith\nXi as its general secretary\uff0dhave taken to help Wuhan fight the epidemic held\nthe key to curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus in what was the\nhardest-hit city, as well as in the province and in the entire country, they\nsaid.\n\nA constant theme has been \"people first\" in the fight against the contagion as\nXi has stressed putting people's lives, safety and health as the top priority\nand placing the people's interests above everything else.\n\nIn his meeting with World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom\nGhebreyesus on Jan 28 in Beijing, Xi said people's safety and their health\nalways come first.\n\nRecounting his experience of leading World Health Organization experts on a\nnine-day joint mission investigating COVID-19 in China, Canadian\nepidemiologist Bruce Aylward commended China's approaches in responding to the\ndisease.\n\n\"If I had COVID-19, I'd want to be treated in China,\" he said. \"They know and\nthey care about keeping people alive, and they do it successfully.\"\n\nWhile masterminding the epidemic prevention and control efforts, Xi gave\nHubei, particularly Wuhan, the provincial capital, priority. He said that\n\"when Wuhan wins, Hubei wins; when Hubei wins, China wins\".\n\nTherefore, since the start of the outbreak, the CPC Central Committee has\ntaken the most comprehensive, thorough and rigorous measures to resolutely\ncurb the spread of the virus in Wuhan and Hubei.\n\nAs experts recommended quarantine measures to help reduce population movement,\nwhich in turn helped to stem the spread of the virus, the CPC Central\nCommittee made the decision on Jan 22 to ask Hubei to stop outbound travel to\nprevent the disease from spreading in other regions.\n\nXi said at a meeting in February that making such a decision demands\ntremendous political courage, but \"time calls for resolute action, otherwise,\nwe would be in trouble\".\n\nOn Jan 23, the authorities in Wuhan announced the lockdown of the city. All\npublic transportation and businesses were suspended, and residents were\nrequired to stay indoors to cut transmission in neighborhoods.\n\nPutting such a huge city with over 10 million residents under quarantine was\nunprecedented but has proved to be effective. During his visit to Wuhan on\nMarch 10, Xi said all prevention and control measures adopted by the CPC\nCentral Committee focus on preventing more people from being infected and are\naimed at saving more patients' lives.\n\n1 [2](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_2.html)\n[3](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_3.html)\n[4](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_4.html)\n[5](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_5.html)\n[6](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_6.html)\n[7](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_7.html)\n[8](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_8.html)\n[9](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_9.html)\n[10](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_10.html)\n[11](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_11.html)\n[12](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_12.html)\n[13](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_13.html)\n[Next](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_2.html)\n[>>|](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_13.html)\n\n[ 1/13 ](javascript:void \\(0\\))\n[Next](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d06fca310aeaeeed5099e_2.html)\n\nPhoto\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/08/5e8d31d1a310aeae9537dd8d.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d31d2a310aeaeeed50b24.html)\n\n### [Travel resumes as Wuhan lockdown\nends](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d31d2a310aeaeeed50b24.html)\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/08/5e8d0fa5a310aeae9537a1c5.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d0f65a310aeaeeed509d9.html)\n\n### [United front puts city on road to\nrecovery](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d0f65a310aeaeeed509d9.html)\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/08/5e8d0140a310aeae9537948c.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d0140a310aeaeeed5098c.html)\n\n### [Top 10 national innovative cities in\nChina](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/08/WS5e8d0140a310aeaeeed5098c.html)\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/07/5e8c4453a310aeae95378046.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8c4453a310aeaeeed508c3.html)\n\n### [Rising temperature reveals lake's hidden\nbeauty](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8c4453a310aeaeeed508c3.html)\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/07/5e8c2b33a310aeae95377118.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8c1804a310aeaeeed507bb.html)\n\n### [The world in photos: March 30 - April\n5](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8c1804a310aeaeeed507bb.html)\n\n[![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202004/07/5e8be678a310128206687f83.jpeg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8be41ca310128217284b95.html)\n\n### [5G unmanned delivery car put into use on\ncampus](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/07/WS5e8be41ca310128217284b95.html)\n\nTop __\n\n[BACK TO THE TOP]()\n\nEnglish\n\n[\u4e2d\u6587](//cn.chinadaily.com.cn)\n\n![](//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/showmobilee.png)\n\n  * [HOME](//www.chinadaily.com.cn)\n  * [CHINA](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/china)\n  * [WORLD](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/world)\n  * [BUSINESS](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/business)\n  * [LIFESTYLE](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/life)\n  * [CULTURE](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture)\n  * [TRAVEL](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/travel)\n  * [WATCHTHIS](http://watchthis.chinadaily.com.cn)\n  * [SPORTS](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports)\n  * [OPINION](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion)\n  * [REGIONAL](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional)\n  * [FORUM](http://bbs.chinadaily.com.cn/)\n  * [NEWSPAPER](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n    * [China Daily PDF](http://newspress.chinadaily.net.cn)\n    * [China Daily E-paper](//epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/china)\n  * [MOBILE](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/newmedia.html)\n\n[![](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2016/sub/a-1.jpg)](//www.chinadaily.com.cn)\n\nCopyright 1995 -  .

Her husband stayed in Illinois. She\ncame home on Jan. 13 \u2014 and brought something with her.\n\nShe gave it to her husband.\n\n\"The individual did not have symptoms while traveling,\" Dr. Jennifer Layden,\nchief medical officer for the Illinois Department of Public Health, explained\nduring a Jan. 24 press briefing sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n\nBut that, of course, was not the end of the story.\n\n\"A few days after arriving home, the patient began to feel unwell,\" Dr.\nAllison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Health, said in that\nbriefing.\n\nThe doctors tried not to be alarmist as they discussed the problem this virus\nfrom Wuhan presented.\n\n\"Again, she was not symptomatic when flying, and based on what we know now\nabout this virus, our concern for transmission before symptoms developed is\nlow. So that is reassuring,\" said Arwady.\n\n\"Since returning from China, the patient has had limited movement outside her\nhome,\" she continued.\n\n\"This is all very reassuring in terms of infection risk to the general public,\nwhich remains low nationally and locally here in Chicago,\" the doctor said.\n\nThis Chicago woman, who had been in Wuhan, was one of the first known COVID-19\ncarriers to enter the United States, according to CDC reports. But she was not\nthe first diagnosed with the virus.\n\nOn Jan. 15, a man in his 30s arrived back in Snohomish County, Washington. He,\ntoo, had been in Wuhan.\n\nOn Jan. 21, three days before it would confirm the Chicago case, the CDC\nannounced that this Washington man was the first U.S. resident to test\npositive for COVID-19.\n\n\"I am also thankful that the man who tested positive for this virus acted so\nquickly to seek treatment,\" said Dr. John Wiesman, the Washington state\nSecretary of Health. \"Because of that we were able to isolate him from the\npublic. His actions gave us a head start. All of this work means we believe\nthe risk to the public is low.\"\n\nOn Jan. 26, the CDC announced three more cases \u2014 including one in Arizona and\ntwo in California.\n\nThese three had one thing in common with the first two.\n\n\"All of these infections were in people with recent travel to Wuhan, China,\nthe epicenter of the outbreak,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the\nCDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nThen another person in Chicago \u2014 who had not been to Wuhan \u2014 tested positive.\nWho was he?\n\n\"The first Illinois case, a woman in her 60s, who returned from Wuhan, China,\nJanuary 13th, is in the hospital in stable condition, and continues to do\nwell,\" Layden explained in a Jan. 30 CDC briefing. \"Public health officials\nhave been actively and closely monitoring individuals who had contact with\nher, including her husband, who had close contact, for symptoms.\"\n\n\"We have now received lab confirmation from the CDC that he indeed has novel\ncoronavirus,\" she said.\n\nThis husband was \"the first person-to-person transmission\" in the United\nStates.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the CDC announced the seventh case. \"The patient recently returned\nfrom Wuhan, China,\" said the CDC.\n\nThat same day, President Donald Trump announced he was suspending entry to the\nUnited States for foreign nationals who had been in China within the past 14\ndays.\n\nIn the two days following Trump's announcement, the CDC detected four more\ncases. Three were in persons who had recently returned from Wuhan. The fourth,\nthe CDC said, was a woman who lived in the same household as one of the\npreviously detected patients who had been in Wuhan.\n\nIn its \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\" published on Feb. 7, the CDC\nsummarized how COVID-19 came to America. \"Nine of the first 11 U.S. 2019-nCoV\npatients were exposed in Wuhan, China,\" it said.\n\nThe other two were the spouse and a household member of U.S. residents who\npicked up the virus in Wuhan.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has stated the truth. \"This virus began in\nWuhan, China,\" he said March 24 on \"Washington Watch with Tony Perkins.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party covered this up and delayed its\nresponse in a way that has truly put thousands of lives at risk,\" Pompeo said.\n\nSince the first few Americans returned from Wuhan unwittingly carrying this\nvirus, the situation has dramatically escalated. As of Tuesday, the CDC\nestimated there were 374,329 COVID-19 cases in the United States and 12,064\nCOVID-19 deaths.\n\n\"So,\" Pompeo told Perkins on March 24, \"Every day that the Chinese Communist\nParty sat on this information and didn't do the right thing, and instead\npunished doctors who were attempting to alert the world about what was taking\nplace there in Wuhan, increased the number of people who would be exposed, and\nthereby put all of us all around the world \u2014 and the Chinese people as well \u2014\nput them at unnecessary risk, too.\"\n\n\"There will come a day when we will go evaluate how the entire world\nresponded,\" Pompeo said at a March 17 briefing.\n\nWhen this pandemic has passed, every aspect of U.S. relations with China\nshould be reevaluated and recalculated to do just one thing: put the American\npeople first.\n\n_(Terence P.

While further guidance is in process, this\nInitiative largely adjusts or suspends many key compliance programs of the\nService. (A complete copy of the press release can be found here:\n<https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unveils-new-people-first-initiative-\ncovid-19-effort-temporarily-adjusts-suspends-key-compliance-program>.)\n\nSome of the key changes and/or highlights include the following:\n\n**Existing Installment Agreements** -For taxpayers under an existing\nInstallment Agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are\nsuspended. Taxpayers who are currently unable to comply with the terms of an\nInstallment Payment Agreement, including a Direct Debit Installment Agreement,\nmay suspend payments during this period if they prefer. Furthermore, the IRS\nwill not default any Installment Agreements during this period. By law,\ninterest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n\n**New Installment Agreements** - The IRS reminds people unable to fully pay\ntheir federal taxes that they can resolve outstanding liabilities by entering\ninto a monthly payment agreement with the IRS.\n\n**Offers in Compromise (OIC)** - The IRS is taking several steps to assist\ntaxpayers in various stages of the OIC process:\n\n  * **Pending OIC applications** - The IRS will allow taxpayers until July 15 to provide requested additional information to support a pending OIC. In addition, the IRS will not close any pending OIC request before July 15, 2020, without the taxpayer's consent.\n  * **OIC Payments** - Taxpayers have the option of suspending all payments on accepted OICs until July 15, 2020, although by law interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n  * **Delinquent Return Filings** \\- The IRS will not default an OIC for those taxpayers who are delinquent in filing their tax return for tax year 2018. However, taxpayers should file any delinquent 2018 return (and their 2019 return) on or before July 15, 2020.\n  * **New OIC Applications -** The IRS reminds people facing a liability exceeding their net worth that the OIC process is designed to resolve outstanding tax liabilities by providing a \"Fresh Start.\"\n\n**Non-Filers** -The IRS reminds people who have not filed their return for tax\nyears before 2019 that they should file their delinquent returns. More than 1\nmillion households that haven't filed tax returns during the last three years\nare actually owed refunds; they still have time to claim these refunds. Many\nshould consider contacting a tax professional to consider various available\noptions since the time to receive such refunds is limited by statute. Once\ndelinquent returns have been filed, taxpayers with a tax liability should\nconsider taking the opportunity to resolve any outstanding liabilities by\nentering into an Installment Agreement or an Offer in Compromise with the IRS\nto obtain a \"Fresh Start.\" See IRS.gov for further information.\n\n**Field Collection Activities** \\- Liens and levies (including any seizures of\na personal residence) initiated by field revenue officers will be suspended\nduring this period. However, field revenue officers will continue to pursue\nhigh-income non-filers and perform other similar activities where warranted.\n\n**Automated Liens and Levies** - New automatic, systemic liens and levies will\nbe suspended during this period.\n\n**Passport Certifications to the State** **Department** - IRS will suspend new\ncertifications to the Department of State for taxpayers who are \"seriously\ndelinquent\" during this period. These taxpayers are encouraged to submit a\nrequest for an Installment Agreement or, if applicable, an OIC during this\nperiod. Certification prevents taxpayers from receiving or renewing passports.\n\n**Private Debt Collection** - New delinquent accounts will not be forwarded by\nthe IRS to private collection agencies to work during this period.\n\n**Field, Office and Correspondence Audits** - During this period, the IRS will\ngenerally not start new field, office and correspondence examinations. We will\ncontinue to work refund claims where possible, without in-person contact.\nHowever, the IRS may start new examinations where deemed necessary to protect\nthe government's interest in preserving the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n  * **In-Person Meetings -** In-person meetings regarding current field, office and correspondence examinations will be suspended. Even though IRS examiners will not hold in-person meetings, they will continue their examinations remotely, where possible. To facilitate the progress of open examinations, taxpayers are encouraged to respond to any requests for information they already have received - or may receive - on all examination activity during this period if they are able to do so.\n  * **Unique Situations** \\- Particularly for some corporate and business taxpayers, the IRS understands that there may be instances where the taxpayers desire to begin an examination while people and records are available and respective staffs have capacity. In those instances when it's in the best interest of both parties and appropriate personnel are available, the IRS may initiate activities to move forward with an examination -- understanding that COVID-19 developments could later reduce activities for an agreed period.\n  * **General Requests for Information** \\- In addition to compliance activities and examinations, the IRS encourages taxpayers to respond to any other IRS correspondence requesting additional information during this time if possible. __\n\n**Earned Income Tax Credit and Wage Verification Reviews** - Taxpayers have\nuntil July 15, 2020, to respond to the IRS to verify that they qualify for the\nEarned Income Tax Credit or to verify their income. These taxpayers are\nencouraged to exercise their best efforts to obtain and submit all requested\ninformation, and if unable to do so, please reach out to the IRS indicating\nthe reason such information is not available. Until July 15, 2020, the IRS\nwill not deny these credits for a failure to provide requested information.\n\n**Independent Office of Appeals** - Appeals employees will continue to work\ntheir cases. Although Appeals is not currently holding in-person conferences\nwith taxpayers, conferences may be held over the telephone or by\nvideoconference. Taxpayers are encouraged to promptly respond to any\noutstanding requests for information for all cases in the Independent Office\nof Appeals.\n\n**Statute of Limitations -** The IRS will continue to take steps where\nnecessary to protect all applicable statutes of limitations. In instances\nwhere statute expirations might be jeopardized during this period, taxpayers\nare encouraged to cooperate in extending such statutes. Otherwise, the IRS\nwill issue Notices of Deficiency and pursue other similar actions to protect\nthe interests of the government in preserving such statutes. Where a statutory\nperiod is not set to expire during 2020, the IRS is unlikely to pursue the\nforegoing actions until at least July 15, 2020.\n\n**Practitioner Priority Service** - Practitioners are reminded that, depending\non staffing levels and allocations going forward, there may be more\nsignificant wait times for the PPS. The IRS will continue to monitor this as\nsituations develop.\n\nRosenberg Martin Greenberg LLP continues to monitor developments relating to\nresponses to COVID-19. It is anticipated that further announcements and\ninterpretations to supplement this Initiative will be released in the coming\nweeks.\n\n[__Send](javascript:sendit\\(\\);)

By subscribing\nto our website, you expressly consent to your information being processed in\nthe United States.\n\n  * **Our Legal Basis for Processing:** Generally, we rely on our legitimate interests in order to process your personal information. For example, we rely on this legal ground if we use your personal information to manage your Registration Data and administer our relationship with you; to deliver our Website and Services; understand and improve our Website and Services; report reader analytics to our authors; to personalize your experience on our Website and Services; and where necessary to protect or defend our or another's rights or property, or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, safety or privacy issues. Please see Article 6(1)(f) of the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") In addition, there may be other situations where other grounds for processing may exist, such as where processing is a result of legal requirements (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)) or for reasons of public interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(e)). Please see the \"Your Rights\" section of this Privacy Policy immediately below for more information about how you may request that we limit or refrain from processing your personal information. \n  * **Your Rights**\n    * **Right of Access/Portability** : You can ask to review details about the information we hold about you and how that information has been used and disclosed. Note that we may request to verify your identification before fulfilling your request. You can also request that your personal information is provided to you in a commonly used electronic format so that you can share it with other organizations. \n    * **Right to Correct Information** : You may ask that we make corrections to any information we hold, if you believe such correction to be necessary.\n    * **Right to Restrict Our Processing or Erasure of Information** : You also have the right in certain circumstances to ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or to erase your personal information. Where you have consented to our use of your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time. \n\nYou can make a request to exercise any of these rights by emailing us at\n[privacy@jdsupra.com](mailto:privacy@jdsupra.com) or by writing to us at:\n\nPrivacy Officer  \nJD Supra, LLC  \n10 Liberty Ship Way, Suite 300  \nSausalito, California 94965  \n\nYou can also manage your profile and subscriptions through our Privacy Center\nunder the \"[My Account](/managemyaccount/manageaccountinfo.aspx)\" dashboard.\n\nWe will make all practical efforts to respect your wishes.

For example, if you are an author, your personal information may continue to be published in connection with your article indefinitely. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n  * **Onward Transfer to Third Parties** : As noted in the \"How We Share Your Data\" Section above, JD Supra may share your information with third parties.

Generally speaking, the\nInitiative provides relief to: (1) taxpayers who have payment obligations\nunder an IRS Installment Payment Agreement (an \" **IA** \") or Offer in\nCompromise (an \" **OIC** \"), (2) taxpayers (other than high-income non-filers)\nwho are or would have been the subject of IRS field collection actions (such\nas liens and levies) and IRS-initiated private debt collection efforts, and\n(3) most taxpayers who would have been the subject of a new field, office, and\ncorrespondence examination. However, the IRS will continue to: (A) remotely\nwork current appeals cases, field, office, and correspondence examinations,\nand refund claims where possible, without in-person contact; and (B) take\nsteps where necessary to protect all applicable statutes of limitations and\nthe interests of the government in preserving such statutes._\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the IRS issued Information Release 2020-59 (the \"\n**Release** \") announcing the Initiative and discussing, among other things,\nthe its plans with respect to IAs, OICs, field and automated collection\nactivities, audits, appeals, and efforts to protect applicable statutes of\nlimitations.\n\n**1\\. Installment Agreements**\n\nThe IRS will permit taxpayers to suspend all IA payments that are due between\nApril 1 and July 15, 2020 (the \" **Relief Period** \") and will not treat a\ntaxpayer as being in default under an IA during the Relief Period. However,\ninterest on unpaid balances will continue to accrue during the Relief Period,\nhence taxpayers should consider whether to continue or stop their IA payments.\nIt should be noted that the Release does not state how the suspended payments\nwill be accounted for following the Relief Period (e.g., all come due on July\n15, or be spread out over post-July 15 payments).\n\nFor now the IRS continues to accept new IA applications in accordance with the\nregular rules.\n\n**2\\. Offers in Compromise**\n\nThe IRS is also permitting taxpayers to suspend all OIC payments due during\nthe Relief Period. Just as with IAs, interest on unpaid balances will continue\nto accrue during the Relief Period, hence taxpayers should consider whether to\ncontinue or stop their OIC payments. It should be noted that the Release does\nnot state how the suspended payments will be accounted for following the\nRelief Period (e.g., all come due on July 15, or be spread out over post-July\n15 payments). Also, the IRS will not treat a taxpayer as being in default\nunder an OIC solely because the taxpayer is delinquent in filing his, her or\nits 2018 tax return. However, the taxpayer must file his, her or its 2018 tax\nreturn by July 15, 2020.\n\nFor taxpayers who are in the process of applying for an OIC, the IRS will\nallow taxpayers until July 15, 2020 to provide requested additional\ninformation to support their application and will not close any OIC\napplication before July 15, 2020 without the taxpayer's consent.\n\nFor now the IRS continues to accept new OIC applications in accordance with\nthe regular rules.\n\n**3\\. Collection Activities**\n\nThe IRS will suspend all liens and levies (including personal residence\nseizures) initiated by field revenue officers, all new automatic, systemic\nliens and levies, and all referral of delinquent accounts to private\ncollection agencies, during the Relief Period. However, field revenue officers\nwill continue to pursue high-income non-filers and perform other similar\nactivities where warranted.\n\n**4\\. Audits and Appeals**\n\nThe IRS is not suspending current appeals cases, field, office, and\ncorrespondence examinations, and refund claims. Instead, the IRS will switch\nfrom in-person meetings to remote interaction, such as video or telephone\nconference.\n\nThe IRS will generally not start new field, office and correspondence\nexaminations, with the exception of unique situations when it is in the best\ninterest of both parties to begin an examination and appropriate personnel are\navailable. In addition, the IRS may start new examinations where deemed\nnecessary to protect the government's interest in preserving the applicable\nstatute of limitations.\n\n**5\\. Other Suspensions**\n\nThe Release also addresses the suspension of new certifications to the U.S.\nDepartment of State for taxpayers who are \"seriously delinquent\" during the\nRelief Period and the extension of taxpayers' time to respond to the IRS to\nverify that they qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit or to verify their\nincome (and the IRS will not deny these credits for a failure to provide\nrequested information during the Relief Period).\n\n**6\\. Statute of Limitations**\n\nThe IRS is clear that it will continue to take steps where necessary to\nprotect all applicable statutes of limitations. If a statute of limitation is\nset to expire in 2020, the IRS will first seek an agreement with the taxpayer\nto extend the statute, but if the taxpayer does not cooperate, then the IRS\nwill issue a Notice of Deficiency and pursue other similar actions to protect\nthe interests of the government in preserving the statute of limitations. The\nIRS is unlikely to pursue the foregoing actions until at least July 15, 2020\nin all other cases.\n\n**7\\. Conclusion**\n\nThe Release represents a continuation of the U.S. Department of Treasury's and\nIRS's efforts to provide relief to taxpayers facing challenges resulting from\nthe novel COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, the U.S. Department of Treasury\nissued Notices postponing until July 15, 2020 the due date for filing federal\nincome tax returns, paying federal income taxes, filing gift and generation-\nskipping transfer tax returns, and paying federal gift or generation-skipping\ntransfer taxes.\n\n[Seyfarth Shaw LLP](/contributors/seyfarth-shaw-llp) \\- [John P.\nNapoli](/19414/author/John_P_Napoli/), [Rotem Bar-\nKokhva](/19414/author/Rotem_Bar_Kokhva/) and [Michael\nLobie](/19414/author/Michael_Lobie/)\n\n__ Back __ Forward\n\n  * [ __ Save & file  ](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3df26373ad-ea23-4b25-a19c-bbc36ea4ffb9)\n  * [ __ View original  ](/library/document.ashx?g=9a0c285e-8bbe-4605-b4eb-a8852aec9075 \"View the original document this article came from\")\n  * [ __ Forward  ](mailto:?body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20be%20interested%20in%20this%20article%20on%20Lexology%3A%20The%20IRS%20Announces%20a%20%E2%80%9CPeople%20First%20Initiative%E2%80%9D%20That%20Will%20Temporarily%20Ease%20Taxpayer%20Payment%20Obligations%20and%20Postpone%20IRS%20Compliance%20Actions.%20%0A%0D%0AYou%20can%20access%20the%20article%20for%20free%20using%20this%20link%3A%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lexology.com%2Fr.ashx%3Fl%3D8V8KB42%20%0A%0D%0ALexology.com%20-%20legal%20intelligence.&subject=Lexology%3A%20The%20IRS%20Announces%20a%20%E2%80%9CPeople%20First%20Initiative%E2%80%9D%20That%20Will%20Temporarily%20Ease%20Taxpayer%20Payment%20Obligations%20and%20Postpone%20IRS%20Compliance%20Actions. \"Forward this article to a colleague via email\")\n  * [ __ Print  ](javascript:LogPrint\\(\\); window.print\\(\\); \"Print this article\")\n  * __ Share\n\n    * [ __Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3df26373ad-ea23-4b25-a19c-bbc36ea4ffb9)\n    * [ __Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?status=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3df26373ad-ea23-4b25-a19c-bbc36ea4ffb9)\n    * [ __Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3df26373ad-ea23-4b25-a19c-bbc36ea4ffb9&title=&summary=&source=)\n\n  * __ Follow \n\nPlease login to follow content.\n\n  * [Like](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3df26373ad-ea23-4b25-a19c-bbc36ea4ffb9)\n\n__\n\nadd to folder:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n  * My saved (default)\n  * Read later ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\nFolders shared with you\n\n  * ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n### Filed under\n\n  * [USA](/hub/usa)\n  * [Tax](/hub/tax)\n  * [Seyfarth Shaw LLP](/search/?f=19414)\n\n### Tagged with\n\n  * [IRS](/hub/irs)\n  * [Coronavirus](/hub/coronavirus)\n\n### Popular articles from this firm\n\n  1. #####  [ Paid Leave and Coronavirus \u2014 Part VI: DOL Releases Q&A And Mandatory Poster On Families First Coronavirus Response Act * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=f57aa046-0707-41b2-8d2c-07517740f021)\n\n  2. #####  [ More States Seek to Expand Business Interruption Coverage to Include COVID-19-Related Losses * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=a7cb457c-6d98-4250-8566-2a0a7c5ce4b6)\n\n  3. #####  [ Nonprofit Guide to the CARES Act (Including Those Loans You\u2019ve Been Hearing About to Cover Payroll and That Don\u2019t Need to Be Paid Back) * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=a02c2a36-1975-4e69-98ec-66f5b0b37aaa)\n\n  4. #####  [ Compliance Alert: The EEOC Announces Its Views On ADA, Title VII, and ADEA Considerations During The Pandemic * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=c1b2e72e-663a-4a5e-8482-6daa7a8c40af)\n\n  5. #####  [ COVID-19 Update: Force Majeure Under California Law in Business and Commercial Disputes * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=4bae4585-3359-45d0-89a3-f79f1ef5a47a)\n\nIf you would like to learn how Lexology can drive your content marketing\nstrategy forward, please email\n[enquiries@lexology.com](mailto:enquiries@lexology.com \"Email us\").\n\n![Powered by Lexology](/images/redesign_2015/Powered_by_Lexology_Logo-\nprint.png)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nFrom force majeure to employment issues - follow the latest thinking from the\nworld's leading business law firms as the virus continues to spread.\n\n[Visit research centre](https://www.lexology.com/research/hubs/coronavirus)\n\n### Featured Video\n\n[ ](/learn/video/understanding-possessory-land-rights-in-guatemala)\n\n__1:05 min\n\n####\n\n##### Consortium Legal\n\n[\n\n#### Understanding possessory land rights in Guatemala\n\n](/learn/video/understanding-possessory-land-rights-in-guatemala)\n\n[Watch now](/learn/video/understanding-possessory-land-rights-in-guatemala)\n\n###  Related topic hubs\n\n  1.

integrity of its core culture\nwhile continuing to dominate the industrial services space as it expands its\nreach across North America. For Apache, \"Doing it Right\" has always meant more\nthan exceeding customer expectations -- it means innovating without\ncompromising its pledge to protect the skilled craftsmen on the front lines.\n\n**Ownership all around**\n\nApache is a team of leaders. It is a team of men and women dedicated to doing\nevery job the right way. Every Apache craftsman is empowered to take ownership\nof his or her actions and to be a leader in whatever task they are asked to\ncomplete.\n\n\"Success is 100-percent about our people, our craftsmen,\" said Apache\nIndustrial Services CEO Mike Knigin. \"Finding the right solutions to problems\nin the field is everyone's job. No matter what your role or position is, every\nmember of the Apache team is committed to working with our customers and\nensuring the job is getting done the right way.\"\n\nLeadership at Apache means creating a work environment where craftsmen are\ncomfortable learning, growing and refining their trade. Knigin continued,\n\"Being a member of the Apache team doesn't make you a 'yes man.' Every member\nof our team is a leader. They are comfortable and empowered to speak up, take\naction, make a positive impact and look out for their safety, as well as the\nsafety of their fellow craftsmen. The moment one of our craftsmen feels like a\nnumber is the moment we've failed to work with Apache Pride.\"\n\nApache believes \"performance with a sense of purpose\" is what differentiates\nthe company from the pack. The collective engagement and pride of its people,\nalong with the ability of each to take ownership of their actions, drives\nsafe, high-quality work at every level of the organization.\n\n**People first, always**\n\nTo put people first, Apache has invested in its human capital, through\ninnovative approaches to the hiring and training experience of its craftsmen.\n\"We've said it before, but we'll say it again: Our people are our greatest\nasset. As leadership, one of our top priorities is giving our people ample\nopportunities to learn and develop,\" said Chief Human Resources Officer Greg\nBarnes. \"Our success is directly tied to our ability to make Apache the\nindustry's employer of choice. We need to work constantly to foster an\nenvironment where our people want to be \u00e2\u00a6 where they can make a difference.\"\n\nBarnes joined the Apache leadership team to support the company's expanding\nworkforce. This is just one example of the company's commitment to its people.\nIn addition to this, Apache has reimagined the craftsman experience through\noverhauling its hiring and training centers.\n\nA craftsman's experience with Apache starts the moment he or she steps into a\nhiring office -- before training and before they ever step foot on a jobsite.\nIn December 2019, Apache officially opened the doors of its new hiring and\ntraining centers in Deer Park, Texas. These centers, located within the same\nbuilding to provide ease of access, were designed with craftsmen in mind. They\nprovide individuals who are interested in joining Apache with a smooth and\nefficient hiring experience.\n\nThe facility streamlines the application and onboarding process with spaces\nspecifically designed for each step. The brightly colored facility trims the\nonboarding process from several hours down to a more efficient time of 40\nminutes or less. Tablets in the lobby function as kiosks for each candidate to\nquickly check in and provide personal information, minimizing wait time and\npaper waste.\n\nApache is also the first company to ever partner with the Houston Area Safety\nCouncil (HASC) -- a monumental collaboration that enables Apache to house a\nclinic inside the hiring center, allowing craftsmen to consolidate an often\ntime-consuming component of the hiring process into one comprehensive visit.\nAfter being hired, new team members can seamlessly transition into their first\nday of Apache training.\n\nThe Deer Park training center boasts craftsmen training resources never before\nbrought together under one roof. Prospective craftsmen can begin their\ntraining through in-house training modules, or webinars taught by instructors\nmiles away through the center's digital learning interface. Along with these\nresources, the interior d\u00c3\u00a9cor of both centers has been purposefully designed\nto feature real Apache craftsmen in action, as well as framed memorabilia of\nthe company's work and past projects.\n\nBut the ultimate hiring experience doesn't end there. Apache's training campus\nand production space in Houston is the first of its kind and continues to give\nthe company a tremendous edge. \"This facility's wide range of amenities and\naccommodations allows us to prepare our craftsmen for anything, as well as\ndeliver an uncommon level of service for our customers,\" said Apache\nIndustrial Services COO David Bretherton.\n\nApache administers comprehensive safety and skills training at the facility on\na regularly scheduled basis. The company continues to collaborate with a\nnumber of technical organizations at the training center, including NCCER,\nNACE, Service Industry Association (SIA) and others. In addition to\ncertifications, extra learning and skill refinement, the training center\nprovides the link for employees to become infused into the company culture\nwith ongoing immersion in \"Apache Pride.\"\n\nIn addition to classroom-style learning, written evaluations and training,\nApache is able to perform pre-job field performance assessments at the\nfacility for all crafts, including scaffolding and insulation. This means\nApache workers have the technical skills, safety background and practice they\nneed before they ever step onto a jobsite. Apache and its customers know the\ncraftsmen on the job are the right craftsmen for the job, and there is no\nambiguity about the high caliber of expertise or skillset of any craftsman on\nthe Apache team. The investment in the Apache hiring and training centers\nplays a vital role in the company's mission to be a leader in the\nqualification, training and retention of its people.\n\n**Disruption and innovation**\n\nWhile service remains the core of Apache's offerings, the company has been\npushing the envelope with new, smart product solutions for its customers. One\nexample of this is Allform, a forming and shoring system that was internally\ndeveloped by the company's team of engineers. The system seeks to reduce\ncraftsmen fatigue and materials cost while increasing productivity.\n\n\"Over the years, we experienced all the problems and obstacles that plagued\nforming and shoring projects. The Allform system is designed to address these\nproblems with practical, efficient design,\" said Apache Vice President of\nOperations Kenneth Chevis. \"This one system provides endless solutions to our\ncustomers and helps craftsmen do their jobs more safely and efficiently.\"\n\nThe system's components are interchangeable for different applications. Panels\nare fabricated from aluminum, allowing for easy installation, while being\ndurable enough for multiple uses as opposed to more cumbersome traditional\nalternatives like steel with disposable wood. Synthetic facing lasts much\nlonger and leaves a smoother surface following removal, and the system can be\nconfigured for a variety of forming and shoring applications.\n\n\"We're not the kind of company that is satisfied with the status quo. That's\njust a part of who we are,\" said Knigin. \"The development of Allform is\nexactly the kind of problem-solving and innovation we want -- the kind that's\nborn from our people's own innate desire to fix something and make it better.\"\n\n**Safety first**\n\nSafety has always been, and will always be, core to how Apache does business.\nThe company is proud of its safety performance, with a TRIR of .06 while\nlogging over 17 million man-hours in 2019. \"As a business, we are committed to\nmaking a difference in our industry with a workforce that understands what\nthat means and a leadership group that never settles for average performance.\nWe have created an environment where everyone is committed to our vision. It\nbecomes contagious and has influenced the foundation of our organization:\nsafety, quality, onboarding, execution and marketing,\" said Chief Safety\nOfficer Tysen Lutz. \"Every piece of the puzzle is filled with Apache Pride.\"\n\nApache employees are empowered to work safely on every task, every time.\nLeadership has the expectation that every Apache craftsman takes pride in his\nor her work. In fact, employees are trained that safety is the \"signature\"\nthey leave on each job. All employees must own their work and be prepared to\ndefend the quality of their efforts.\n\nCraftsmen \"make it personal\" with regard to safe work practices, and each\nparticipates in creating a Personal Safety Plan that is carried with the\nemployee at all times. The Personal Safety Plan serves as a constant reminder\nthat safety must remain top-of-mind. It is intended to motivate employees to\nlook out for the safety of their fellow colleagues as well as their own. It\nalso serves as a reminder that safety matters to customers, to co-workers and,\nmost of all, to the families who rely on Apache employees to come home safely\neach and every day.\n\nKnigin added, \"Safety is more than a performance indicator; it's a cultural\nindicator. If our safety performance is strong, it means our message and\ncommitment to our people are connecting directly with our craftsmen.\" With its\nunparalleled focus on safety, Apache is recognized as an \"A\" rated contractor\nwith ISNetworld, Browz, PICS and other related industry organizations. The\ncompany's peers consistently recognize this commitment to safety, and its\ncustomers have come to rely on Apache to deliver safe and quality work.\n\n**Growing with purpose**\n\nPart of building a culture of performance is protecting what works. It also\nentails preserving the integrity of what has come before while adding new ways\nof thinking and doing. Apache will continue to build on its growing reputation\nin the areas it serves, but will do so strategically and with purpose.\n\n\"Customer satisfaction is based on safe execution, trust, honesty,\ncommunication, listening to the voice of the customer and displaying a sense\nof urgency when the situation calls for it,\" said Executive Vice President of\nBusiness Development James Fiscus. \"This is something that will always be true\nfor Apache.\"\n\n\"While our growth is exciting, we never want to lose sight of what matters\nmost to us. Our people will always come first,\" stated Knigin.\n\nThrough its work, record of safety and culture, Apache continues to make a\nstatement. But it is the actions of Apache's craftsmen that speak the loudest\nand most clearly define and differentiate a company \"Doing it Right.\"\n\n**For more information on Apache Industrial Services, call Mike Knigin or\nJames Fiscus at (713) 450-9307, or\nvisit[www.apacheip.com](http://www.apacheip.com).**\n\n#### Tags\n\n[Apache Industrial Services](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/apache-\nindustrial-services/) [Maintenance &\nReliability](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/tag-maintenance-reliability/)\n[Front Cover](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/front-cover/)\n\nMarch 31, 2020\n\n2:34 PM\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BICMagazine1/)\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/bicmagazine)\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCIzppnXMoyKq1EqgfycklQ)\n[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/24772832/)\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bic_magazine/)\n\n![](//bicalliance.img-\nus3.com/admin/bicmagazine_logo_spot_2.png?r=0.5133610582347545)\n\nEmail*\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nCompany*\n\nBIC Magazine Newsletters*\n\nIndustry Report Weekly Enewsletter\n\nResources Monthly Enewsletter\n\nBIC & Industry Events\n\nPlease verify your request*\n\nSubscribe\n\n![](https://design1-wc.metropublisher.net/downloads/11118/download/BIC-white-\nlogo.svg)\n\nConnecting people in business and industry with one another for the betterment\nof all.

 * __\n\nI am in denial.\n\nA month ago, I sat on a park bench in lower Manhattan and watched my screen as\nNew York state officials declared a COVID-19 state of emergency. A day later,\nI called my Dad when Duke sent the first tentative emails unraveling our\nsemester\u2014I told him not to worry, that there was no crisis, that an extended\nSpring Break and online classes were probably temporary, that I would return\nto Durham and life would continue normally.\n\nA few days later in Denver, while I stayed with my mom\u2019s family, the death\ntoll rose. More university emails sent me into a panic about my housing and\nbelongings. I coped by raiding my grandfather Boppy\u2019s closet for his vintage\nsweaters. I tried to help other students and community members with what I\nnaively hoped were only temporary crises. States and cities shut down, Duke\ncanceled graduation, millions lost their jobs, indefinite social distancing\nand isolation set in.\n\nI still believed I would see my friends. I still woke up telling myself the\npanic would subside in a few weeks. I still attempted to write my thesis,\napply for jobs, set ambitious goals in my classes, read\u2014after all, I was\nsupposed to Keep Learning and Keep Working as normal, just online. I still\nchecked the Johns Hopkins [coronavirus\ntracker](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) twice a day. As the United\nStates overtook China and Italy to become the epicenter for this global\npandemic, I found multiple ways to dissociate from reality (some not fit to\nprint).\n\nI was in denial. I still am. Duke is, too.\n\nThis pandemic and its consequences will become worse. There is no \u201cnormal\u201d to\nKeep or return to. [Best case\nprojections](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2020/04/07/825479416/new-yorks-coronavirus-deaths-may-level-off-soon-\nwhen-might-your-state-s-peak) still predict overrun hospitals, hundreds of\nthousands taken by the virus (not to mention those now denied treatment for\ntheir pre-existing medical needs), and months until a vaccine can be produced\non a mass scale. Public health officials warn us that the hardest-hit cities,\nlike New York and New Orleans, have not yet reached their [peak number of\ninfections](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/coronavirus-live-news-\nupdates.html)\u2014outbreaks and intense waves of the virus are likely to continue\nfor the rest of the year, if not longer. Close to 10 million unemployment\nclaims have been filed. The pain, fear and anxiety that so many of us now\nconfront is unimaginable. Moreover, pervasive social and economic inequality\nensures the consequences of COVID-19 are worse for the\n[poor](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/us-address-impact-covid-19-poor#),\nfor communities of color (by initial data, [specifically Black\npeople](https://twitter.com/nhannahjones/status/1247176506452905986)), and for\n[women](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/us/equal-pay-coronavirus-economic-\nimpact.html). And this is still only the beginning.\n\nWe are experiencing something unprecedented. We worry more about\nimmunocompromised family members and friends in the face of an unknown and\nhighly infectious disease. We, or someone we care about, are living in an\nunhealthy and stressful home, becoming the caretaker for younger siblings or\nelders, cut off from friends and counselors and stable routines, losing jobs\nand internships, and shouldering the same rigorous academic load on that\ngodforsaken platform called\n[Zoom](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/style/zoom-parties-coronavirus-\nmemes.html). As if this moment is just a temporary inconvenience. We will see\nmembers of our communities lose their jobs and perhaps their homes. We will\nsee federal, state, and local governments ignore the unique vulnerabilities of\nour [unhoused](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21183812/covid-19-coronavirus-\nhomeless), [incarcerated](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/19/this-\nchart-shows-why-the-prison-population-is-so-vulnerable-to-covid-19) and\n[undocumented](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/covid-19-doesnt-\ndiscriminate-neither-should-congress-response/) neighbors. We will probably\nget sick. We will have to grieve in social isolation. No one knows how long it\nwill last.  \n\nOur situation is bleak. I know this pandemic will ultimately fade, but I also\nknow we confront immense suffering in the meantime. Taking care of ourselves,\nour families and our communities now takes highest priority. Creating space to\ngrieve, to mourn the myriad consequences of this pandemic in our lives, in our\ncommunity\u2019s lives, takes highest priority.\n\nYet, Duke has asked us to Keep Learning, Keep Teaching and Keep Working, to\nkeep being productive \u201cdespite the unprecedented challenges,\u201d to pretend that\nwe could replicate Duke virtually. This messaging does not put our community\u2019s\nwell-being first. Instead, Duke\u2019s notion of productivity is rooted in denial\nabout what will happen as this pandemic grows worse. It is symptomatic of a\ncampus stuck in a toxic, individualist, hyper-competitive mindset. We aren\u2019t\ntaught to question the underlying assumption that academic accomplishment and\ncareer ambition still come first.\n\nWe don\u2019t need business-as-usual Duke\u2014we need more flexibility, more grace,\nmore reminders that our academic productivity isn\u2019t more important than our\nability to survive.\n\nWe need policies like universal pass, the only equitable option, and canceled\nfinal exams.\n\nWe need more faculty members who recognize that their expectations must\nchange, that their way of teaching must change.\n\n### Get The Chronicle straight to your inbox\n\nSignup for our editorially curated, weekly newsletter.

Faculty, deans, administrators: please read\nthe room. Keep Learning, Keep Teaching, Keep Working keeps us in denial. Make\nthe rest of the semester optional.

We are facing this together, and we want to be part of the\nsolution to improve the lives of all people in our country.\" The changes focus\non the collection side, with particular focus on Installment Agreements,\nOffers in Compromise, collection attempts, audits, verification reviews and\nappeals.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n  * **Installment Agreements**. If you have a client on an Installment Agreement, payments otherwise due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are suspended. The IRS will not default any Installment Agreement during this period, but note that interest will continue to accrue on balances. You may still file for an Installment Agreement during this time period.\n\n  * **Offers in Compromise (OIC).** If your clients have pending applications, you have until July 15, 2020 to provide additional requested information in support. The IRS will not close any pending OIC prior to July 15, 2020 without taxpayer consent. Taxpayers may suspend payments on any accepted OIC until July 15, 2020. Interest will continue to accrue. If your client is delinquent in their 2018 tax year filings, the IRS will not default their OIC provided they file their delinquent 2018 return and their 2019 return by July 15, 2020.\n\n  * **Field Collection Activities.** Liens and levies initiated by field officers, including seizures of personal residences, will be suspended until July 15, 2020. However, high-income non-filers will still be pursued during this time. Automated liens and levies will be suspended until July 15, 2020. Passport Certifications to the State Department are on hold during this timeframe, so if you have a client that crosses the minimum balances to trigger this certification, this would be an excellent time to submit an Installment Agreement.\n\n  * **Audits.** Between now and July 15, 2020, the IRS will not start new examinations, unless they are deemed necessary to protect the government's interest due to an impending statute of limitation. The IRS will continue to work refund claims where possible. Where a taxpayer requests--and where it is in the best interest of both parties--the IRS will continue with an examination during this time period.\n\n  * **Verification Reviews.** Taxpayers have until July 15, 2020 to respond to IRS requests for verification of their qualification for the Earned Income Credit or to verify their income. The IRS will not deny their credits for a failure to provide requested information before that date.\n\n  * **Appeals.** Appeals continues to work up its cases, but will not hold in-person conferences, only telephone conferences.\n\nThe IRS notes that it \"will continue to review and, where appropriate, modify\nor expand the People First Initiative as we continue reviewing our programs\nand receive feedback from others,\" so adjustments to this Initiative may come\nas we move forward.\n\n[__Send](javascript:sendit\\(\\);) [__Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n[__Report](/reportaproblem/index.aspx)\n\n### Latest Posts\n\n  * [EPA Compliance Monitoring Activities/Enforcement Actions/Enforcement Results Fiscal Years 2006-2018: U.S. EPA Office of Inspector General Report](/legalnews/epa-compliance-monitoring-activities-94652/)\n  * [Stormwater Enforcement: Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment -

it used to be MC Online, but now it is\nStudent Learning Space (SLS).\n\nIt's not known how long children need to stay out of school. Should the agony\nprolong, this work-from-home mother of a Primary 5 pupil has a wish list for\nthe Education Ministry (MOE).\n\n#### 1\\. DITCH THE PASSWORD\n\nMy child's teacher is tired of resetting passwords for her students. I'm tired\nof remembering them too.\n\nWouldn't it be wonderful if access to SLS can be secured by SingPass, our\nnational digital authentication system?\n\nOne million people here are already scanning their faces or fingerprints on\ntheir phones to access hundreds of e-government services using the SingPass\nMobile app, which was launched in 2018.\n\nAllowing parents to use SingPass Mobile to access SLS and every supplementary\ne-learning portals the schools use will remove the hassle of remembering\npasswords. Parents can register a SingPass account for their children when\nthey turn 15, the minimum age to set up a national digital identity in\nSingapore.\n\n#### 2\\. PROVIDE ENOUGH CAPACITY\n\nTraffic surges could have been anticipated and addressed beforehand.\n\nLast Wednesday was the first HBL day to prepare for a scenario where [the\nCovid-19 outbreak](https://www.straitstimes.com/coronavirus) worsens. I was\nthinking: \"Surely SLS would buckle under the weight of 200,000 primary school\npupils descending on it.\" And it did.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: Laptops, headsets - families all set for home-based\nlearning](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/laptops-headsets-\nfamilies-all-set-for-home-based-learning)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [MOE lends 3,300 devices to students who need them for home-based\nlearning amid Covid-19\npandemic](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/3300-devices-loaned-by-moe-to-\nstudents-who-need-them-for-home-based-learning-amid-covid-19)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Snapask and SPH to offer free e-learning service and news content for\nSingapore students](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/snapask-\nand-sph-to-offer-free-e-learning-service-and-news-content-for-singapore)\n\nThere were system glitches - even though schools had told students to stagger\ntheir access - with parents reportedly waiting an hour before they could log\nin.\n\nI only logged into SLS for my daughter to complete her online assignments on\nThursday, when primary school pupils returned to school. Even though it wasn't\nthe scheduled e-learning day, we still encountered frequent screen freezing.\n\n#### 3\\. PUT THE USER FIRST\n\nContent should be accessible on most devices. However, tablets - no matter how\nprevalent they are - cannot be used for e-learning.\n\nMy daughter was not able to record her Chinese reading tasks directly on SLS\nusing our Apple iPad even though the device is powered by the latest operating\nsystem. A separate app must be downloaded for the recording, and the audio\nfile uploaded on SLS separately.\n\nSimilarly, she could not complete her mathematics online assignment using the\niPad. The developer has somehow forgotten to add support for a virtual\nkeyboard.\n\nSLS works on a laptop.\n\nI was happy my 10-year-old had a bit of fun last week after discovering a flaw\nin SLS using my office laptop. She gleefully said she could play a pre-\nrecorded audio file reading the Chinese passage she was supposed to read, and\nhave the reading recorded at the same time. She submitted the perfect reading\nas her own work initially and congratulated herself for the nearly perfect\nscore.\n\nI don't intend to buy her a laptop just to do SLS homework; I feel it is too\nwasteful. Last weekend, however, many parents succumbed to the pressure to\nprepare for the month-long HBL; they were seen snapping up laptops in consumer\nelectronics stores.\n\nI prefer to use devices I already own - an iPad or a smartphone. Is it wishful\nthinking to expect SLS developers to build content to work on most devices?\nMost other online content is built on this principle, and I don't see why SLS\nshould be the exception.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: MOE provides tips for parents on supporting children's\nonce-weekly home-based\nlearning](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-moe-provides-\ntips-for-parents-on-how-to-support-childrens-learning-at-home)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: A guide to preparing your child for home-based\nlearning](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-a-guide-to-\npreparing-your-child-for-home-based-learning)\n\n#### 4\\. EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF LEARNING\n\nLearning should involve some level of teacher-child interaction.\n\nBut last Wednesday's HBL was devoid of any such interaction - perhaps because\nit was for only one day. It was worksheets galore for the four subjects:\nEnglish, mathematics, science and Chinese.\n\nBut going forward, I understand that there will be some form of teacher-\nstudent interaction via Google Meet. Earlier this week, my child proudly\nannounced to me that her teacher had created a Gmail account for every\nstudent.\n\nEven so, I fear I might have to play the role of school teacher for the next\none month - simply because I'm around and within easy reach of my child. I\nfear it will be hard to draw work-life boundaries too especially when parents'\ne-mailbox and WhatsApp beep non-stop with school and work messages.\n\nI believe most parents understand that academic progress will suffer with\nschool closure.

pandemic](https://www.straitstimes.com/coronavirus), they are\nall fighting a common enemy and should cooperate closely with one another,\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday (April 8).\n\nHe said this in a video message for the World Health Organisation (WHO)\nWestern Pacific regional office's second virtual meeting of health ministers\nin the region, themed \"Stand in

since the start. We have done our\nbest to detect cases and isolate them, and to trace their contacts and\nquarantine them to stop further transmission.\n\n\"We have encouraged people to keep safe distances apart, wash their hands and\nnow, to wear masks when going out,\" he said.\n\nHowever, PM Lee said it has been a very difficult fight, and the number of\ncases has continued to rise despite the country's efforts. Hence,\nsubstantially tighter safe distancing measures were introduced in the form of\na \"circuit breaker\".\n\nDay 1 of these[ enhanced measures started on\nTuesday](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-empty-trains-and-\nquiet-streets-as-singapore-enters-day-1-of-circuit-breaker).\n\n\"We have closed all non-essential workplaces and required telecommuting\nwherever possible. We have also closed schools and childcare centres. We have\ntold everyone to stay home,\" said PM Lee.\n\nThese measures are painful but essential, he stressed, adding that the next\nfew weeks will be crucial for the country to bring the outbreak under control.\n\n\"Many other countries have done the same. Each country has different\ncircumstances, social norms and resources, but we are all fighting the same\nenemy - Covid-19,\" he said.\n\n\"We must cooperate closely with one another, and learn from one another's\nexperiences.

Inslee signed the final four bills of Rep. Christine Kilduff\u2019s\n(D-University Place) tenure as State Representative from the 28th District.\nThe four bills focus on putting our Washington National Guard members,\nworkers, and people with disabilities first.\n\n\u201cEach of these bills prioritizes people,\u201d said Kilduff. \u201cWhether an injured\nworker, a Guard member, or an individual with developmental disabilities, when\nour government puts people first, we create better outcomes for our whole\nstate.\u201d\n\n[HB\n1651](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1651&Year=2019&Initiative=false)\nestablishes and consolidates the rights of persons with developmental\ndisabilities who rely on critical state services. It also requires that they\nare informed of these important rights.\n\n[HB\n2390](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2390&Initiative=false&Year=2019)\namends several disability-related laws so they use respectful, person-first\nlanguage. Individuals with disabilities will no longer be referred to as\n\u201chandicapped persons\u201d and children with disabilities will no longer be\nreferred to as \u201cchildren who are crippled,\u201d among other changes.\n\n[![Ed Selden Carpet One](https://i1.wp.com/thesubtimes.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2015/10/Ed-Selden-Carpet-\nOne-1200x400-layout2169-1f84v5p.png?fit=600%2C200&ssl=1)![Ed Selden Carpet\nOne](https://i1.wp.com/thesubtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ed-Selden-\nCarpet-\nOne-1200x400-layout2169-1f84v5p.png?fit=600%2C200&ssl=1)](https://thesubtimes.com/linkout/65114)\n\n[HB\n2409](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2409&Initiative=false&Year=2019)\nhelps workers injured on the job get the treatment they need and workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits they are owed. The bill updates penalties for self-\ninsured employers who fail to follow the law.  Last amended in 1985, these\nchanges will help ensure that taking care of injured workers is a company\u2019s\nfirst priority.\n\n[SB 5197 (HB\n1201)](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5197&Chamber=Senate&Year=2019)\nsponsored by Sen. Steve Hobbs (Kilduff sponsored the companion bill in the\nHouse of Representatives) expands and enhances college tuition assistance\nbenefits available to our state\u2019s National Guard members by creating the\nWashington National Guard Postsecondary Grant Program. The Guard assists\ncommunities across the state and deploys across the world. Increasing the\ninvestment in the education and career development of the Guard will make\nWashington more competitive and help recruit and retain Guard members. This\nlegislation is of special significance to the 28th District as it is home to\nCamp Murray, headquarters of the Washington National Guard.\n\nKilduff has served as a State Representative since 2015. She announced on\nMarch 12th that she would not seek re-election to her seat in the 28th\nDistrict which encompasses University Place, Steilacoom, Fircrest, DuPont,\nAnderson and Ketron Islands, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Camp Murray, and parts\nof Lakewood and Tacoma.\n\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/#print \"Click to print\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  * [Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=pinterest \"Click to share on Pinterest\")\n  * [Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=pocket \"Click to share on Pocket\")\n  *   * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)](https://thesubtimes.com/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-governor-put-people-first/?share=tumblr \"Click to share on Tumblr\")\n  *   * \n\n###  _Related_\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/2020/04/03/final-kilduff-bills-signed-by-\ngovernor-put-people-first/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The release\nfollows recent findings that blacks are falling to the illness at higher rates\nthan other races in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and Washington\nD.C.\n\n\u201cThis data is preliminary because fully 43% of the people who passed we do not\nyet have information on their race and ethnicity and are working hard to be\nable to complete those records,\u201d Ferrer said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the county said that 169 people had died of COVID-19. Of those\ndeaths, officials had racial information for 93 and released the following\nbreakdown:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatino **28%**  \nWhite **27%**  \nAsian **19%**  \nBlack ******17%**  \nOther **9%**\n\n\u201cWhen we look at these numbers by the total population of each group, African\nAmericans have a slightly higher rate of death than other races,\u201d Ferrer said.\n\nBlack people make up 9% of the population of L.A. County.\n\nMeanwhile, Latinos comprise nearly half the county population but 28% of\ndeaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe coronavirus death percentages for white and Asian residents more closely\nmatched their share of the county population.\n\nWord of the finding prompted dismay among black community activists and\nofficials, who say it speaks to enduring issues of trust between blacks and\nthe healthcare system, as well as poor messaging and resources.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised at all,\u201d South Los Angeles activist Najee Ali said. \u201cAs\nthe days go on, I believe the rates of African Americans will continue to rise\ndisproportionately.\u201d\n\nRecently, a _[Los Angeles Times\nanalysis](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-\ncases-wealthy-rich-test-la-county)_ found that many of L.A. County\u2019s whitest\nand wealthiest enclaves were reporting far higher rates of infection than\npoorer neighborhoods of color. However, public health officials said those\ndisparities did not necessarily mean the virus was spreading more widely\nthrough richer neighborhoods than in poorer ones. Instead, the reporting was\nlikely skewed by uneven access to testing and, in some instances, by wealthy\nresidents who traveled internationally and had some of the earliest confirmed\ninfections.\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet our free Coronavirus Today newsletter\n\n[](https://membership.latimes.com/newsletters)\n\nSign up for the latest news, best stories and what they mean for you, plus\nanswers to your questions.\n\nSign Me Up\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe finding, some experts said, could be bad news for local efforts to control\nthe spread of COVID-19, as it suggests a disparity of testing along the lines\nof race, income and immigration status that could be obscuring potential hot\nspots in disadvantaged communities and giving residents there the false\nimpression that they have less to fear from the virus.\n\nThat is exactly what happened, Ali said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that some of our young people didn\u2019t take this seriously, which\nincluded passing on the myth initially that blacks couldn\u2019t catch the\ncoronavirus,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat myth spread like wildfire on social media, but\nthere was never a concentrated effort from leaders to dispel that myth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris acknowledged Tuesday that\nthis rumor had caused harm among blacks, and more needed to be done to dispel\nit.\n\n\u201cThat rumor is completely false and its really important for all of us to get\nout there in debunking that rumor,\u201d Harris said Tuesday. \u201cOne of the pieces\nthat we also recognized is that because of the true and unfortunate history of\nmedical maltreatment of different groups of people, but especially African\nAmericans in the United States, there are real issues of trust between the\nAfrican American community and the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBlacks have been found to have higher rates of diabetes, high blood pressure,\nobesity and smoking-related deaths than whites, according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. Also, they are more likely to not see a doctor\nbecause of the cost, CDC data shows.\n\nThese underlying health conditions coupled with a lack of access to affordable\nhealthcare puts blacks at greater risk, said Chandra Ford, a professor at the\nUCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\u201cThere\u2019s something about the context in\nwhich people live, the inequalities in our society, that render some groups\nmore susceptible to the same exposure,\u201d said Ford, founding director of the\nCenter for the Study of Racism, Social Justice and Health at UCLA. \u201cIf they\nare exposed to the same thing another group is exposed to, they\u2019ll fare\nworse.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the racial composition of deaths, Los Angeles County also\nreleased the following breakdown of coronavirus cases where there is\ninformation:  \nWhite **870**  \nLatino **735**  \nOther **693**  \nAsian **316**  \nBlacks **283**  \nUnder Investigation **3,711**\n\nDuring his evening news conference Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti\nsaid no group was immune to coronavirus. \u201cBut like many things in our society,\nthis disease, especially the way it kills, is hitting folks with preexisting\nconditions \u2026 disproportionately found in poor communities and communities of\ncolor.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong-term racial disparities still exist, he said.\n\nThroughout much of the outbreak in the United States, Democratic lawmakers and\nlocal politicians have urged a closer accounting of race when it comes to\nreporting coronavirus testing, deaths and hospitalizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is indefensible not to be collecting complete demographic data \u2014 that\nmeans racial, ethnic, gender, age, national origin, all of that matters,\u201d said\nCounty Sup. Mark Ridley-Thomas\n\nHe said he was stunned that the data weren\u2019t already collected in the county.\n\n\u201cThe largest county in the nation, the 17th largest economy in the world, and\nnot being able to collect that data runs the risk of perpetuating\ndisparities,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a policymaker, decision maker, it gets pretty\ndirectly to the allocation of resources. If you don\u2019t know where the problem\nis most pronounced, how do you know where to direct those resources? And we\nshould know, we must know. There\u2019s no excuse not to know.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Ferrer told reporters that COVID-19 testing \u201cis happening much\nless\u201d in poorer communities of L.A. County. \u201cPeople who are living in\nwealthier communities have had, in fact, better access to testing and in fact\nhave been tested more than people who are living in communities where income\nlevels are much lower,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile more than 35,300 people have been tested as of April 6, with about 14%\ntesting positive, Ferrer said, she believes there are more than 20,000\nnegative lab results that are not included in the county\u2019s statistics. She\nhoped to have a more accurate count of the percent of people testing positive\nby the end of the week, and by early next week, produce a complete report on\nwhat they know about access to lab testing.\n\nFerrer has said that blacks and Native Americans are among the groups in L.A.\nCounty that share a disproportionate burden of illness going into a pandemic\nand are \u201cmuch more likely to have higher rates of almost every illness that we\ncollect information on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving serious underlying health conditions makes you at much higher risk for\nserious illness, and even death, from COVID-19,\u201d she said. \u201c\n\nIt remains unclear when the state will release overall data on race when it\ncomes to the coronavirus. In Sacramento on Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said he\nhad received preliminary data on race and hospitalizations, deaths and ICU\npatients, but that \u201cwe are still waiting for all of the data before I make it\npublic and present it. I want it to be accurate, but that is being broken down\nin real time.\u201d\n\nNewsom said the same needed to be done with respect to testing.\n\n\u201cDisparities on testing are a point of obvious and real concern,\u201d he said.\n\n_Times Staff Writers Soumya Karlamangla, Joseph Serna, Sarah Parvini and\nColleen Shalby contributed to this report._\n\n* * *\n\n[California](https://www.latimes.com/california)[Coronavirus\nPandemic](https://www.latimes.com/topic/health)\n\nNewsletter\n\nThe stories shaping California\n\n[](https://membership.latimes.com/newsletters)\n\nGet up to speed with our Essential California newsletter, sent six days a\nweek.\n\nSign Me Up\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n[ ![](https://ca-\ntimes.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e47757c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-\ntimes-\nbrightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2F26%2F4aac2e1c1a1dcee23c470472d179%2Fimg-54f784f1-turbine-\nla-bio-ben-poston) ](https://www.latimes.com/people/ben-poston)\n\n[Ben Poston](https://www.latimes.com/people/ben-poston)\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * [twitter](https://twitter.com/bposton)\n  * [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/latimes/)\n  * [email](mailto:ben.poston@latimes.com)\n  * [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/latimes)\n\nBen Poston is an investigative reporter specializing in data at the Los\nAngeles Times.\n\n[ ![](https://ca-\ntimes.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af4c6ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-\ntimes-\nbrightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F3a%2Fbde384f075d369645de60ded103f%2Fimg-535fc168-turbine-\nla-bio-tony-barboza) ](https://www.latimes.com/people/tony-barboza)\n\n[Tony Barboza](https://www.latimes.com/people/tony-barboza)\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * [twitter](https://twitter.com/tonybarboza)\n  * [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/latimes/)\n  * [email](mailto:tony.barboza@latimes.com)\n  * [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/latimes)\n\nTony Barboza is a reporter who covers air quality and the environment with a\nfocus on Southern California.

people in China lost their jobs in the first 2 months of\n2020\n\nPublished Mon, Mar 16 20205:37 AM EDTUpdated Mon, Mar 16 20209:48 AM EDT\n\n[Evelyn Cheng](https://www.cnbc.com/evelyn-\ncheng/)[@chengevelyn](https://twitter.com/chengevelyn)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Data released Monday indicated roughly 5 million people in China lost their jobs amid the outbreak of the new coronavirus in January and February.\n  * The jump in unemployment was just one of several data points released Monday that showed how severely the virus has hit growth in the world's second-largest economy.\n  * Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, expects employment will remain Chinese authorities' priority, even if there's a hit to the 2020 GDP growth target. \n\nA couple wearing protective facemasks as a prevention measure against the\nCOVID-19 coronavirus walk at a nearly empty shopping mall in Beijing on\nFebruary 27,

according to data\npublished Monday.\n\n[China](https://www.cnbc.com/china/)'s official, but highly doubted, urban\nunemployment rate jumped in February to 6.2%, its highest on record, the\nNational Bureau of Statistics said. That's up from 5.3% in January and 5.2% in\nDecember.\n\n\"It's pretty meaningful, as over 5 million more workers lost (a) job in the\npast two months,\" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in an\nemail.\n\nVIDEO2:3502:35\n\nChina's recovery will be held back by weaker demand amid virus outbreak,\nMoody's Analytics says\n\n[Street Signs Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/street-signs-asia/)\n\nAs of the end of last year, 442.47 million people were employed in urban\nareas, government data show, indicating that at least 4.67 million people have\nsince lost their jobs, based on official figures.\n\nChina's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country\n[changed its methodology](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-\njobs-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-new-unemployment-measure-has-big-job-\nahead-idUSKBN1HP0MC) from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to\ncapture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near\n4% to 5% for the last 20 years.\n\nThat makes a jump to 6.2% particularly notable. Mao Shengyong, a spokesperson\nfor the National Bureau of Statistics, emphasized during a press conference\nMonday that the unemployment rate will likely fall in the second half of the\nyear as businesses resume work.\n\n## More job losses expected\n\nMore than half of the country extended a Lunar New Year [holiday shutdown by\nat least a week](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/01/coronavirus-more-of-china-\nextend-shutdown-accounting-for-80percent-of-gdp.html) in an effort to limit\nthe spread of COVID-19. The coronavirus has killed more than 3,200 people in\nChina and has since [hit more than 140 countries\nworldwide](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-\nreports/20200315-sitrep-55-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=33daa5cb_6) in a global\npandemic. Fears of the impact on global growth have sent markets reeling.\n\nBy last week, the officially reported [resumption of work rate in China was\nabout 60%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/coronavirus-batters-china-\nrestaurants-as-millions-struggle-to-return-to-work.html) for small and medium-\nsized enterprises, and significantly higher for larger companies. However,\nanalysts have pointed out that reopening a business typically does not mean it\nis operating at the same capacity as it normally would.\n\nDan Wang of The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that 9 million people in\nChina's cities will lose their jobs this year as a result of the virus'\nimpact.\n\nThe jump in unemployment was just one of several data points released Monday\nthat showed how severely the virus has hit growth in the world's second-\nlargest economy. Retail sales of consumer goods dropped 20.5% year on year in\nJanuary and February. Online sales of physical consumer goods increased 3%,\naccounting for about a fifth of overall retail sales. Industrial production\nfell 13.5%, while fixed-asset investment fell 24.5% over the same period.\n\n## Effect on China GDP\n\nThe contraction in January and February data \"implies negative 1Q GDP growth,\"\nMorgan Stanley economists Robin Xing, Zhipeng Cai and Jenny Zheng said in a\nnote Monday.\n\n\"The weakness [in unemployment] has likely extended into March despite gradual\nproduction resumption, as the number of online job listings shrank further by\n4.6% in the first two weeks of March (vs. -9.3% in February)\" month over\nmonth, they said.\n\nThe additional pressure on the economy from the virus' spread overseas will\nlikely make it even more difficult for China to achieve its GDP growth target.\nThe annual meeting for publicly announcing the figure has been postponed as a\nresult of the virus, but officials have maintained that the country is still\non pace for reaching its goal.\n\nEmphasis on maintaining employment and stable growth expectations \u2014 which are\nkey for economic stimulus, businesses' capital expenditure and consumer\nspending \u2014 could ultimately affect authorities' resolve in pushing for a\ncertain GDP level, according to Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy\nresearch at China Renaissance.\n\nHe pointed out that at a meeting last week of the powerful State Council,\n\"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said,[ 'It's not a big deal whether the economic\ngrowth rate is a bit higher or\nlower](http://www.gov.cn/premier/2020-03/12/content_5490395.htm)' this year as\nlong as China's job market is stable.\"\n\n\"We think the softening tone implies that policymakers may accept a much lower\nGDP growth target for 2020 and blame the virus shock,\" Pang said.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [Asia

It said: \u201cWe are encouraging\nour store managers to dedicate the first two hours of opening on Wednesday\nmorning to the elderly (those of state pension age) and vulnerable people in\ntheir community, such as those with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe commend the action taken by our colleagues in the West Belfast store, who\nhave already dedicated an hour of early-morning opening for the elderly. We\nare focused on being able to feed the nation and to support those most in\nneed.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Europe, major supermarket groups have already moved to dedicated\nshopping hours for older and more vulnerable customers. In Ireland, which has\nwitnessed panic buying on a scale similar to the UK, Lidl said it would\nintroduce prioritised queuing and assistance from 9am to 11am each day for\nolder customers.\n\nLidl Ireland said: \u201cStarting March 17, from 9-11am, we will be implementing\npriority shopping hours for the elderly across all 163 Lidl stores in Ireland.\nThis will include prioritised queuing and additional assistance for our older\ncustomers. We ask that the public respect this time period to allow more\nvulnerable customers to pick up the food and supplies they need.\u201d\n\nBanks are also examining ways to help and protect older customers. Nationwide\nbuilding society said it would open an hour early \u2013 at 8am instead of the\nusual 9am \u2013 at 100 branches across the UK for customers over the age of 70 and\nthose with underlying health conditions.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe arrangement will enable groups of people at highest risk from\ncoronavirus to go about their day-to-day transactions with greater confidence\nand safety during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to use the facilities first, benefiting from enhanced\ncleaning that branches will undergo each evening, and before they open to the\nwider membership from their usual opening times.\u201d\n\nIf the trial is successful, Nationwide said it would consider extending it to\nother branches in its 650 chain.\n\nMandy Beech, Nationwide\u2019s branch network director, said: \u201cWe understand the\ncurrent situation is likely to hit the elderly and vulnerable the hardest, not\nonly because of the higher risk of catching coronavirus, but also through\npotentially feeling isolated from the wider world should this issue continue\nfor a longer period.\n\n\u201cWe also know that many older people rely on public transport. As such, we\nwould ask local authorities and government to consider whether they could\ntemporarily enable use of free bus passes for older people before 9.30am, in\naddition to relaxing parking rules in local high streets at the start of the\nday.\u201d\n\nTopics\n\n  * [Coronavirus outbreak](/world/coronavirus-outbreak)\n\n  * [Supermarkets](/business/supermarkets)\n  * [Retail industry](/business/retail)\n  * [news](/tone/news)\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=202314643182694&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&CMP=share_btn_fb)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=British%20supermarkets%20and%20banks%20offer%20early%20slots%20for%20older%20customers&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&CMP=share_btn_tw)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=British%20supermarkets%20and%20banks%20offer%20early%20slots%20for%20older%20customers&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&CMP=share_btn_link)\n  * [](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?title=British%20supermarkets%20and%20banks%20offer%20early%20slots%20for%20older%20customers&mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers)\n  * [](whatsapp://send?text=%22British%20supermarkets%20and%20banks%20offer%20early%20slots%20for%20older%20customers%22%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&CMP=share_btn_wa)\n  * [](fb-messenger://share?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&app_id=180444840287&CMP=share_btn_me)\n\n  * [Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F16%2Fcoronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers&type=article&internalpagecode=world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers \"Reuse this content\")\n\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Economics](/business/economics)\n  * [Banking](/business/banking)\n  * [Money](/money)\n  * [Markets](/business/stock-markets)\n  * [Project Syndicate](/business/series/project-syndicate-economists)\n  * [B2B](/business-to-business)\n  * [Retail](/business/retail)\n\n  * [News](/)\n  * [Opinion](/commentisfree)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n  * [Culture](/culture)\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifeandstyle)\n\n  * [Contact us](/help/contact-us)\n  * [Complaints & corrections](/info/complaints-and-corrections)\n  * [SecureDrop](https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop)\n  * [Work for us](https://workforus.theguardian.com)\n  * [Privacy policy](/info/privacy)\n  * [Cookie policy](/info/cookies)\n  * [Terms & conditions](/help/terms-of-service)\n  * [Help](/help)\n\n  * [All topics](/index/subjects/a)\n  * [All writers](/index/contributors)\n  * [Digital newspaper archive](https://theguardian.newspapers.com)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theguardian)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/guardian)\n\n  * [Advertise with us](https://advertising.theguardian.com)\n  * [Search UK jobs](https://jobs.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=NGW_FOOTER_INT_GU_JOBS)\n  * [Dating](https://soulmates.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=soulmates_int_web_footer)\n  * [Discount Codes](https://discountcode.theguardian.com/)\n\nBack to top __\n\n\u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The poll also suggests a trend of rising\ne-commerce in proximity to hot spots: 31% of Italians are more frequently\nshopping online to buy products they would normally buy in a store, rising to\n57% of respondents in Vietnam, 55% in India and 50% in China.\n\nMost countries, including hotspots, expect things to return to normal by June.\nTrajectories for the disease and confirmed cases suggest this will not be the\ncase, says Ipsos.\n\n[![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/Y4ZI3zhOOWu06crCKGC0LWLYCwzxDC8NloIOIUh75TE.PNG)](https://www.ipsos.com/en/majority-\npeople-want-borders-closed-fear-about-covid-19-escalates)\n\nDo you expect things to return to normal by June?\n\nImage: IPSOS data provided for the World Economic Forum\n\nShare\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-public-\nperception-economic-health-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-ipsos%2F)\n[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=wef&text=Most%20people%20see%20COVID-19%20as%20an%20economic%20crisis%20first%2C%20health%20risk%20second&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-public-\nperception-economic-health-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-ipsos%2F)\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=WEF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-public-\nperception-economic-health-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-ipsos%2F)\n[](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Most%20people%20see%20COVID-19%20as%20an%20economic%20crisis%20first%2C%20health%20risk%20second&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-public-\nperception-economic-health-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-ipsos%2F)\n[](whatsapp://send?text=Most%20people%20see%20COVID-19%20as%20an%20economic%20crisis%20first%2C%20health%20risk%20second+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-public-\nperception-economic-health-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-ipsos%2F)\n\nLicense and Republishing\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with our [Terms\nof Use](https://www.weforum.org/about/privacy-and-terms-of-use).\n\nWritten by\n\n[Laura Oliver](/agenda/authors/laura-oliver), Editor and writer,\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the\nWorld Economic Forum.\n\nWorld vs Virus Podcast\n\n[ ![](https://assets.weforum.org/tout/image/responsive_medium_SDlL-\nfqPoutYp3XMWf8cRr9BpvB33uN42HXQp0zxAXM.png)\n](https://open.spotify.com/show/36D1oLAmsRimw70XV19Cdf)\n\n[ Listen now on Spotify ![](/assets/further-reading-arrow--grey-\naf5a6000f4deb911ff0f354e51a276706c6ed82f03e39a31a5dee8addc584309.svg)\n](https://open.spotify.com/show/36D1oLAmsRimw70XV19Cdf)\n\nExplore context\n\n![](/assets/tmap-\nicon-c04cb0e1c304860258a35c69ffcf9000b05af20e7e4d1baaefeab57b0937061d.svg)\n\nCOVID-19\n\n[\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/topic/transformation_map_image/responsive_medium_f6nhRVE98lY5tqyzmhdIEfAyX3QvtKNeTXSv9SFucY0.PNG)\n](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G0X000006O6EHUA0?tab=publications)\n\n[ Explore the latest strategic trends, research and analysis\n![](/assets/further-reading-arrow--grey-\naf5a6000f4deb911ff0f354e51a276706c6ed82f03e39a31a5dee8addc584309.svg)\n](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G0X000006O6EHUA0?tab=publications)\n\n## Subscribe for updates\n\nA weekly update of what\u2019s on the Global Agenda\n\n##  Featured: COVID-19 [ View all ![](/assets/thin-\nchevron-491f10d0cb058e9bd64f4cd5fa76b85e5b6c532f8cc93b3dd84dee080e91fd03.svg)](/agenda/archive/covid-19)\n\n[![](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/YSWTJZTD8qNQV3MM7tUDst3j4svTm0CPcheZFf5FZAo.jpg)\n\n### How China\u2019s industrial internet is fighting COVID-19\n\nLau Sengyee 08 Apr 2020](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/china-\ncovid-19-digital-response/)\n[![](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/NOmYx0OgV9dntS0RFYtBkBD5qvRFRJ6qOCJjSTkaMXU.jpg)\n\n### COVID-19: What you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on 8 April\n\nLinda Lacina 08 Apr\n2020](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/covid-19-what-need-know-\ncoronavirus-pandemic-8-april-round-up/)\n\n[\n\n### 3 ways the coronavirus is affecting animals around the world\n\nJosephine Moulds 07 Apr\n2020](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-animals-wildlife-\nbiodiversity-tiger-boar-pandas-zoos/) [\n\n### How can we prepare for the post-coronavirus era?

That case dates back to Nov. 17, 2019, according\nto the [South Morning China\nPost](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-\nchinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back).\n\nThat's more than a month earlier than doctors noted cases in Wuhan, China,\nwhich is in Hubei province, at the end of December 2019. At the time,\nauthorities suspected the virus stemmed from something sold at a wet market in\nthe city. However, it's now clear that early in [what is now a\npandemic](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-national-emergency-us.html),\nsome infected people had no connection to the market. That included one of the\nearliest cases from Dec. 1, 2019 in an individual who had no link to that\nseafood market, researchers reported Jan. 20 in the journal [The\nLancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(20\\)30183-5/fulltext).\n\nScientists now suspect this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and\nsomehow hopped to another animal, possibly the pangolin, which then passed it\non to humans. The disease is now spreading between people without any animal\nintermediary.\n\nNow, doctors and scientists are trying to trace the virus back to where it\noriginated to learn more about its spread. If, for instance, doctors can find\nthe earliest cases, they may be able to identify the animal host where the\nvirus lurks.\n\nThey found that following the Nov. 17 case, about one to five new cases were\nreported every day and by Dec. 15, the total infections reached 27. Daily\ncases seem to have increased after that, with the case count reaching 60 by\nDec. 20, the SCMP reported.\n\nOn Dec. 27, Dr. Zhang Jixian, head of the respiratory department at Hubei\nProvincial Hospital, reported to health officials in China that a novel\ncoronavirus was causing the disease; by that day, it had infected more than\n180 individuals. (Doctors may not have been aware of all of those cases at the\ntime, but only identified those cases after going back over the records, the\nMorning Post reported.)\n\nEven with this Nov. 17 case identified, doctors can't be certain the\nindividual is \"patient zero,\" or the very first individual to have been\ninfected with SARS-CoV-2, and there's a chance even earlier cases will be\nfound, the SCMP reported.\n\nAs of March 13, there were nearly 148,000 cases globally and more than 81,000\ncases in mainland China, with cases on every continent except Antarctica.\nScientists are continuing to study the virus and work on treatments, including\na vaccine. A clinical trial of such a vaccine has already started recruiting\nvolunteers in Seattle, [_Live Science\nreported_](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-vaccine-trial-no-animal-\ntesting.html).\n\n##### Coronavirus science and news\n\n **--**[ **Coronavirus in the US: Map &\ncases**](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-updates-united-states.html)\n**  \n--**[ **What are the symptoms?**](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-\nsymptoms.html) **  \n****--**[ **How deadly is the new\ncoronavirus?**](https://www.livescience.com/how-deadly-is-coronavirus-\ncovid-19.html) **  \n****--**[ **How long does virus last on\nsurfaces?**](https://www.livescience.com/how-long-coronavirus-last-\nsurfaces.html) **  \n****--**[ **Is there a cure for COVID-19?**](https://www.livescience.com/can-\ncoronavirus-be-cured.html) **  \n****--**[ **How does it compare with seasonal\nflu?**](https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html) **  \n****--**[ **How does the coronavirus\nspread?**](https://www.livescience.com/how-coronavirus-spreads.html) **  \n****--**[ **Can people spread the coronavirus after they\nrecover?**](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spread-after-\nrecovery.html)\n\n  *  [ _The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth_](https://www.livescience.com/56598-deadliest-viruses-on-earth.html) \n  *  [ _27 Devastating Infectious Diseases_](https://www.livescience.com/13694-devastating-infectious-diseases-smallpox-plague.html) \n  *  [ _11 Surprising Facts About the Respiratory System_](https://www.livescience.com/44105-respiratory-system-surprising-facts.html) \n\n _Originally published on_[ _ _Live Science__](https://www.livescience.com/)\n_._  \n\n[\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/HIW/LIVE2020w)\n\n[**OFFER: Save at least 53% with our latest magazine\ndeal!**](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/HIW/LIVE2020w)\n\nWith impressive cutaway illustrations that show how things function, and\nmindblowing photography of the world\u2019s most inspiring spectacles, [How It\nWorks](https://www.space.com/43211-how-it-works-magazine-free-issue.html)\nrepresents the pinnacle of engaging, factual fun for a mainstream audience\nkeen to keep up with the latest tech and the most impressive phenomena on the\nplanet and beyond.

None\nof his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No\nepidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The\nfirst fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to\nhospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days\nafter illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of\nexposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in\nthe isolation ward.\"  \n  \nThis snippet from the Lancet article does not say what you are claiming it\nsays in your article. It says that \"no epidemiological link was found between\nthe first patient and later cases.\"  \n  \nIt does not say that no link was found between the first patient and the\nmarket.

The COVID-19 pandemic caught many organizations off guard.\n\nAgility recommends these best practices when developing a pandemic\npreparedness plan:\n\n  * **Identify** possible health risks to employees (i.e., those with compromised immunity or who have traveled to outbreak countries) and challenges for them to continue working, such as school closings and caretaking responsibility.\n  * **Document** your critical business functions, including the required resources to fulfill them.\n  * **Establish** a crisis management team and ensure a continued dialogue about the event.\n  * **Evaluate** and update your human resources, sick leave, and insurance policies. Follow and share CDC guidelines and updates with employees.\n  * **Develop** a strategy to communicate your policies, plans, decisions, and news updates to your employees, stakeholders, clients, and vendors.\n\nMobile locations allow credit unions who've closed their lobbies to continue\nserving members. Some are using mass notification systems to communicate with\nemployees when they're away from work.\n\nAgility, a CUNA Strategic Services alliance provider, is sharing [free\nresources](https://www.agilityrecovery.com/pandemic-preparedness-\nsolutions/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cuna-pandemic-\npackage) including checklists, webinars, and tabletop exercises to help credit\nunions and other businesses navigate the pandemic and other business\ninterruptions.\n\nKEYWORDS [business continuity](/keywords/2580-business-continuity)\n[coronavirus](/keywords/3705-coronavirus) [credit union](/keywords/108-credit-\nunion)\n\n### Post a comment to this article\n\nName*\n\nE-mail (will not be displayed)*\n\nSubject\n\nComment*\n\n## Report Abusive Comment\n\nThank you for helping us to improve our forums.

you\u2019 to the hard-working HR teams putting people\nfirst during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe CIPD is asking people professionals to share stories of their dedication\nto supporting people and organisations through these challenging times.\n\n![#HRtogether](/Images/hr-together-670-x-450_tcm18-74153.jpg)\n\nThe people profession is on the front line of helping organisations to adapt\nand respond to the coronavirus crisis, whilst also having to adapt to\ndifferent circumstances and ways of working themselves. Do you have great\nstories to tell about how HR teams are working, the ways they are responding,\nmaking the right calls and decisions in tough circumstances and supporting\ntheir organisations and people in positive ways? Perhaps it\u2019s individuals\nwho\u2019ve gone above and beyond to support employees during the coronavirus\ncrisis, working tirelessly to ensure people can work remotely for the first\ntime, or fielding questions from colleagues concerned about their health or\nfinancial security.\n\nThe CIPD and People Management magazine have launched a new campaign to\nrecognise the hard work and commitment of people professionals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. We\u2019re asking our worldwide community of HR, L&D and other\npeople professionals to use\n[#HRtogether](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hrtogether&src=typed_query\n\"#HRtogether on Twitter\") to share stories of teams, individuals and\nindependent practitioners who are working hard to put people first in these\nchallenging times.\n\nUnprecedented circumstances have called for unprecedented responses, with\nevery day bringing new practical challenges and ethical dilemmas for\nemployers. People professionals play a vital role in protecting employees\u2019\nsafety and well-being at the same time as safeguarding business continuity \u2013\nfor many, the delicate balancing act of championing better work and working\nlives has never been more palpable.\n\n **Peter Cheese, CIPD Chief Executive, comments:**\n\n\u2018The coronavirus outbreak is challenging organisations and people everywhere,\nforcing us to rapidly adapt and rethink priorities. But it\u2019s also reminding us\nof what good work means to us; not only to provide financial security, but\nalso a sense of purpose and belonging. The crisis has forced many changes in\nhow we work and how we better understand and support our people. Changes which\nin many ways needed to happen and should endure. It has also reminded us how\nmuch we all rely on the work of others \u2013 be it healthcare professionals,\nretail staff, delivery drivers or the myriad other key workers that are\nrisking their lives to keep the rest of us healthy, fed and safe.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m proud to see the dedication of HR teams around the world who are working\nhard behind the scenes to help their organisations adapt, balancing huge\nshifts in demand with supporting the workforce. They\u2019re working through the\nmany different options and ways of protecting workers and their organisations\nto be in the best position to recover and rebuild as the crisis abates, or in\nsome cases to rapidly scale up in essential sectors and parts of the workforce\nwhere demand has grown. They are also trying to make the right decisions\nlegally, financially and ethically.\n\n\u2018We want to say a big \u2018thank you\u2019 to the hard-working HR teams who are putting\npeople first, as well as show the rest of the world what our profession is\nmade of and where our priorities lie. This crisis is going to be a huge test\nfor business agility and will bring new meaning to the idea of \u2018good work\u2019\nthat the CIPD community has supported for so long.\u2019\n\nThe spotlight in recent weeks has been on the world\u2019s biggest home-working\nexperiment, as well as furloughed workers and some harrowing examples of\nbusinesses who\u2019ve put short term interests and profit above people. But there\nare also many other ways in which employers, supported by their HR teams, have\nbeen responding positively to this crisis. Some are redeploying people and\nmachinery to fill essential roles and produce life-saving equipment, while\nothers are introducing new protocols and shift patterns to support social\ndistancing, and new flexible working practices to accommodate workers\u2019\nchildcare needs.\n\nThese challenging times also seem to be bringing out the best in people \u2013 be\nit generously sharing materials, expertise, time and perspectives or making\nsmall but important gestures to keep friends and colleagues motivated through\nthese difficult times.\n\n **David D\u2019Souza,** **CIPD** **Membership Director, comments:**\n\n'We\u2019ve always encouraged employers to go above and beyond the letter of the\nlaw to protect people\u2019s health, well-being and livelihoods wherever possible,\nand to protect their dignity at all times. It\u2019s more important than ever to do\nthat in times like this, but also more challenging than ever too.\n\n\u2018The people profession is having to make difficult decisions, based on\nlimited, fast-moving information and with significant impacts \u2013 whilst also\njuggling concerns about their own family, friends and income security. Not\nevery organisation will survive the economic impact of this pandemic or be\nable to avoid making difficult calls that impact people. But these are not the\nonly tests of our profession \u2013 it\u2019s also how we deal with people in those\nsituations and how we communicate with and support them.\u2019\n\nTo help organisations manage their workforces responsibly and effectively\nduring these difficult times, the CIPD\u2019s employment experts are updating the\n[CIPD Coronavirus hub](https://www.cipd.co.uk/news-views/coronavirus \"CIPD\nCoronavirus hub\") on a daily basis.

Yet the timing,\ncharacter and drivers of this accomplishment remain poorly understood.\n\nHowever, this new study has found a major change in the climate of the region,\nwhich resulted in a dry period, coinciding with the arrival of people on the\ntiny island of Atiu in the southern group of the Cook Islands, around 900AD.\n\nFindings are published in the journal\n[PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2020/03/31/1920975117.full.pdf\n\"PNAS\").\n\n\"The ancestors of the Polynesians, the Lapita people, migrated east into the\nPacific Ocean as far as Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, reaching them around 2800 years\nago. But for almost 1500 years humans failed to migrate any further into the\npacific,\" explains lead researcher, [Professor David\nSear](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/geography/about/staff/ds5.page \"Professor\nDavid Sear\") of the University of Southampton. \"Our research gives us a much\nmore accurate timescale of when people first arrived in the region and helps\nanswer some key questions about why they made their hazardous journey east.\"\n\n![Core sample taken from Lake Te Roto on\nAtiu](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=)Two halves of\ncore sample taken from Lake Te Roto on Atiu\n\nA team of geographers, archaeologists and geochemists from the UK, New Zealand\nand the US, worked with the people of Atiu to collect core samples of lake\nmud, charting over 6000 years of history. Back in the labs in UK and US, the\nmud samples were subjected to a range of analyses including new techniques for\nreconstructing precipitation, and detecting the presence of mammalian faeces.\n\nApart from fruit bats, the Southern Cook Islands never had mammal populations\nbefore humans settled there, so when the researchers found evidence of mammal\nfaeces alongside other evidence for landscape disturbance and burning, it was\na clear sign of the arrival of people. Within 100 years the first settlers,\nmost likely from Tonga or Samoa, changed the landscape by burning native\nforest to make way for crops.\n\nThe team, including undergraduate and postgraduate students from the\nuniversities of Southampton and Washington, as well as scientists from\nNewcastle, Liverpool and Auckland universities, also examined lake sediments\nfrom Samoa and Vanuata. Using this data, they found evidence for a major\nclimate change which coincided with the newly established arrival time of the\nsettlers.\n\nThe data revealed a major change in the climate of the South Pacific region\nwith the main rainbands that bring water to the archipelagos of Vanuatu,\nSamoa, Tonga and Fiji migrating north. The result was the driest period in the\nlast 2000 years.\n\nThis led the researchers to conclude that, alongside growing populations,\nwater stress drove decisions to make dangerous voyages, aided by changes in\nwinds that enabled easterly sailing. Soon after the arrival of people to Atiu,\nthe climate changed again. Rain returned to the eastern Pacific - supporting a\nrapid (c. 200 years) settlement of the remaining islands of Polynesia.\n\nProfessor Sear adds: \"Today, changing climate is again putting pressures on\nPacific island communities, only this time the option to migrate is not so\nsimple. Within two centuries of first arrival those first settlers changed the\nlandscape and the ecology, but were able to make a home. Pacific islanders now\nlive with modified ecologies, permanent national boundaries and islands\nalready occupied by people. The ability to migrate in response to changing\nclimate is no longer the option it once was.\"\n\nThis research was supported by grants from the NERC, Explorers Club and Royal\nGeographical Society. The team wishes to acknowledge the support of the\npeoples of the Cook Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu.\n\n##\n\n/Public Release.

Even during the miners strike when it was tough\nwith short-time working, its was nothing like this.\n\nBusiness leaders must get off their high horses talking about margin, profit\nbefore tax, and investment and think about the majority, and yes, people. For\nexample, when it snows some businesses recognise those that make an effort to\ncome in and still support those who can\u2019t make it. Greedy businesses and\nowners don\u2019t pay those who don\u2019t make it to the office or store. Beyond\nbelief.\n\nThere are some very successful business owners out there who could support\ntheir teams and ensure they still eat three times a day but instead focus on\nrefuelling their boats and planes.\n\nThen there is the supplier -customer relationship. Somewhere between black and\nwhite is grey so we must remember common sense and compromise. We must work\ntogether as decent human beings to protect our families and colleagues. We\nmust keep great relationships and ensure they are in tact when, inevitably,\nthis is over.\n\nDon\u2019t think about as we would do to others but think about as we would like\nothers to do to us. When this is over we will all remember who was fair and\nwho was greedy. Two of my wonderful ex-team members called me today- one who\nwas treated like it was the 1970s and one who worked for an exciting leader\nwho was very supportive. Every eighty years we are told there is a correction.\nThe good guys will win and the [bad guys] will fail.\n\nLet\u2019s remember people, communication, common sense, and most importantly great\nproduct in exciting stores.\n\nThis will end because nothing is forever. There will be a bounce for retail,\nfor travel and for entertainment.

elderly patient in hospital in Brescia, Italy. Photograph: Flavio Lo\nScalzo/Reuters\n\nItaly is facing [serious\nchallenges](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/from-confidence-to-\nquarantine-how-coronavirus-swept-italy), with demand for critical care far\noutstripping supply. Health officials there are having to make very [difficult\ndecisions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-\nexperience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war) about who to treat \u2013 in the\nknowledge that deciding not to treat will very likely lead to death.\n\nOn Thursday the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and\nIntensive Care, issued [guidelines advising\ndoctors](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-\nbed/607807/) how to deploy scarce resources when the need for them is\noutstripped by the demand of critically ill patients. The guidelines state\nthat priority should be given to those who have, first, \u201cgreater likelihood of\nsurvival and, second, who have more potential years of life\u201d.\n\n## Coronavirus UK cases: find out how many are in your area\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-coronavirus-cases-how-\nmany-are-in-your-area)\n\nAs a result, patients with underlying conditions and elderly patients, who are\ndeemed to stand less chance of surviving the virus, may not be treated in\nfavour of healthier and/or younger people who have more chance of recovery.\n\nIn the coming months we may face a similar situation in the UK where we do not\nhave the resources necessary to treat all people who will catch Covid-19. So\nhow do healthcare professionals decide who to treat?\n\n> Patients with underlying conditions and elderly patients, who stand less\n> chance of surviving the cornavirus outbreak, are not being treated in favour\n> of younger healthier people who have more chance of recovery\n\nThe basic principle being applied in Italy is one we are all familiar with \u2013 a\nform of utilitarianism \u2013 which aims at maximising the number of lives saved.\nThis approach does not value any one life over another \u2013 all lives are equally\nvaluable \u2013 but it does say that we should focus resources where they are\nlikely to save the most lives. This means prioritising for treatment those\npeople who are most likely to benefit from the treatment and recover quickly\nenough to vacate the bed and allow the next person in. This way, more lives\nare saved overall.\n\nThis may be anathema to those of us, including myself, who intuitively prefer\na \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d queuing system. That seems familiar, impartial,\nequitable and fair. That may well be the best strategy in normal times \u2013 but a\npandemic is not normal. It is an emergency, and while emergencies do not call\nfor a suspension of ethics, they do call on us to revisit our priorities \u2013 and\nthat will always be horribly uncomfortable.\n\nConsider that the person first in the queue suffering from Covid-19 is an\nolder \u2013 but not elderly \u2013 person, with an underlying lung condition that means\nthey need critical care. Treatment would not be futile \u2013 it might save their\nlife \u2013 but to choose to treat them would require an extended period of\ncritical care and the outcome would be uncertain. The next two people in the\nqueue are of similar age and have been hit hard by the virus, but they do not\nsuffer with underlying lung problems. They are more likely to survive.\n\nThey also need critical care to get them over the worst effects of the virus,\nbut because they have no underlying health conditions they will pass out of\nthe danger zone faster, meaning that both of them are likely to be saved in\nless time, and for less resource, than it would take to try to save the first\npatient. In this scenario, assuming that all three cannot be given critical\ncare, it appears to make sense to treat the person who will take up fewer\nresources with a more certain outcome and free up the bed faster.\n\nThere is something very intuitively plausible about a system that aims to save\nas many lives as possible. But the way to do this is to do what Italy has\ndone, and prioritise those who are most likely to survive. The knock-on effect\nis that elderly people and those with underlying health conditions \u2013 who are\nless likely to benefit from treatment and would take longer to see benefits \u2013\nmight not receive treatment. This is a gut-wrenching consequence. It is a\nconclusion that, ultimately, says some people should be left to die.\n\n## How to give your elderly relatives coronavirus advice: a doctor\u2019s view |\nRachel Clarke\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/elderly-relatives-\ncoronavirus-advice)\n\nBut we cannot expect to be comfortable in scenarios like this. This kind of\nsituation places us in a genuinely dilemmatic situation in which we have good\nreasons to be obliged to try to save all lives, but we are nonetheless forced\nby circumstance to choose who to try to save. Whatever we choose to do, we\nwill be doing something wrong \u2013 and that is a defining feature of a genuine\nmoral dilemma. No one should be comfortable with this kind of conclusion. If\nwe do end up here, by taking this kind of decision we will not win. We will\nall lose in some way.\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the people who would have to make these\ntriage decisions are the clinicians on the frontline. They will have an\nimpossible job, and yet they will do it. These are the people who will bear\nthe brunt of this dilemma \u2013 day in, day out \u2013 and who will be having to make\nthe decisions that may leave them feeling instinctively that they have done\nsomething wrong. They will be facing the families of those who have died or\nare dying, and explaining to them why they made no effort to save them. This\nwill come at a cost \u2013 and that itself requires an ethical response.\n\nWhen we think about ethics in healthcare, a key principle is avoiding harm and\nsuffering. Here, however, there is no avoiding harm. All we can do is try to\nmitigate it, and if we cannot mitigate it completely then we need to be\nunderstanding and accept \u2013 desperately hard though it is \u2013 that not everyone\ncan be saved. This is something we already know \u2013 we just try not to think\nabout it. In a pandemic like this, however, we cannot help but confront it\nhead on.\n\n\u2022 Dr Jonathan Ives is deputy director of the Centre for\n[Ethics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ethics) in

At that\ntime, the global Covid-19 count was around 88 000 with no transmissions\nreported in SA.\n\nThree days into the Harvard programme, Covid-19 infections soared globally and\nSA's first case was diagnosed. Harvard, therefore, made the call to suspend\nthe OPM programme as Du Toit and all his peers returned home to their\nrespective countries.\n\nUpon Du Toit's arrival at the office, we immediately made the call for him to\nwork from home until he was sure his health was in the clear following his\ntrip abroad. That was on Thursday, 5 March 2020, and the effects of the\npandemic since then has been unprecedented.\n\nCurrently, the global infection rate has surpassed 240 000 with more than 150\ninfections reported in SA. The economic impact across the world is ominous,\npeople are scared, and companies are left with crucial decisions to make to\nensure business continuity. But most of all, companies are left with the\ncrucial responsibility of placing people first.\n\nOur decision to let our CEO manage a group of companies from the safety of his\nhome was the first of many people-centric decisions to follow. As the Covid-19\ncount continues to soar, Mint as a group had to respond to the fluidity of the\nsituation with great agility.\n\nThanks to the power of a people-first culture, technology innovation and\nstreamlined crisis communication, we were able to do just that.\n\n**Crisis communication 101**\n\nThere are three things necessary in keeping People First while handling a\ncrisis the scale of Covid-19. Firstly, real-time communication is key.\nSecondly, co-ordination is critical to ensure that communication is\nconsistent, credible and accurate. And thirdly, calm; if the leadership\nremains calm and assured, then employees will too.\n\nCrisis communication 101 encourages resolute and steady communications, and\nthis is what we have adopted with our employees, clients and partners. As a\nglobal systems integrator, we are fortunate that technology is an active\nenabler to ensuring business continuity for our clients and we have embraced\nthis to its full advantage.\n\nWe have set up a Crisis Communications team tasked with informing our\nemployees and all stakeholders of our position in this rapidly developing\nsituation. We also published our Mint Communications PowerApp, which helps\nmaintain productivity and bring Minties closer in a time of isolation. The app\ncontains current information regarding Covid-19 in SA and across the globe. It\nalso pushes regular updates to employees with links to validated information\nthat help to ensure calm in a time of grave uncertainty.\n\nWe have also imposed travel restrictions on all business travel with immediate\neffect as the health and wellbeing of our employees, clients and partners are\nof utmost importance.\n\nLastly, we set up hand sanitiser stations around the office and have\nimplemented a facial recognition solution for access control, so that physical\ncontact biometrics are no longer used.\n\n **Connecting the remote workforce**\n\nThis week, more than a quarter of our employees are working from home, and we\nwill see this number rising following the president's announcement of school\nclosures around SA.\n\nWe have prepared our organisation for remote working by driving Microsoft\nTeams adoption (a productivity tool that promotes a seamless collaboration\nexperience in remote situations) and increasing our internal communications to\nkeep everyone abreast of every person\u2019s work and health status.\n\nFor Mint, the decision for staff to work from home was an easy one; with the\nuse of Microsoft Azure and being ISO certified, we were able to assure our\nclients of the utmost security regarding their data and our systems.This\nensured that amid a global pandemic, our teams are still meeting online,\ngathering requirements, building solutions and adding value to our clients,\nall via the power of Microsoft Teams and the Azure cloud.\n\nIt is so easy to panic and make quick, and sometimes poor, decisions as\norganisations try to find the balance between long-term business\nsustainability, cash flow and staff health. Leading with a People First\nstance, however, remains as sound and sensible decisions need to be made.\n\nAs we all aim to maintain productivity and remain profitable in a time of\ncrisis, it is important to remember that passion is not linked to a desk;\ninnovation does not only happen between 8am and 5pm; location is no longer\nrelevant in a world fuelled by technology innovation; and employees are human\nbeings with families, interests and dreams.\n\nAs Minties, we have built a culture that can live and grow from anywhere, and,\nwhile times are most certainly uncertain, we trust that the very fibre of our\norganisation, our people, will collectively carry us through; and we will do\nour utmost to carry them and those things they hold dear in return.\n\nAs the world continues to fight the spread and impact of Covid-19, let\u2019s use\ncommunication to keep us closer and calmer, technology to keep us productive,\nand our values to keep us focused and strong.\n\n**About the authors**\n\nThe Mint Group Crisis Communications Team comprises the Head of People, Lauren\nClark; the Head of Marketing, Sugeshni Subroyen; and the Chief Financial\nOfficer, Yvonne Dias.\n\n#####\n\nEditorial contacts\n\nYolandi Booyens (011) 856 4400\n[yolandi.booyens@mintgroup.net](mailto:yolandi.booyens@mintgroup.net)\n\nLogin with\n\nGoogle icon Google\n\nFacebook icon Facebook\n\n_chat_bubble_\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/Logitech-\nlogo.gif)](http://ad.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?log=yes&bannerid=39592&zoneid=&source=&dest=http://www.logitech.com/en-\nza)\n\n_print_\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/OKI_button.jpg)](http://adsrv.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?bannerid=34222&zoneid=0&source=&dest=http://www.okisa.co.za/)\n\n[Twitter icon ](https://twitter.com/ITWeb)\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/Logitech-\nlogo.gif)](http://ad.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?log=yes&bannerid=46537&zoneid=&source=&dest=http://www.logitech.com/en-\nza)\n\n[Linkedin icon ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30318/)\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/mimecast_logo.png)](http://ad.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?log=yes&bannerid=46656&zoneid=&source=&dest=https://www.mimecast.com)\n\n[Facebook icon ](https://www.facebook.com/ITWebZA)\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/ACSEmbrace_logo.gif)](http://adsrv.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?bannerid=41888&zoneid=0&source=&dest=http://www.embrace.co.za/)\n\n[_local_post_office_](/newsletters)\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/DFA_logo.jpg)](http://ad.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?bannerid=32759&zoneid=&source=&dest=http://www.dfafrica.co.za/)\n\n[Youtube play icon ](https://www.youtube.com/user/ITWEBvideo)\n\n[![](https://www.itweb.co.za/static/misc/toolbox/sqwidnet_logo.gif)](http://adsrv.itweb.co.za/adclick.php?bannerid=39164&zoneid=0&source=&dest=http://www.sqwidnet.com)\n\n[_accessibility_](mailto:?subject=Staying%20people%20first%20during%20a%20global%20pandemic&body=There%20are%20three%20things%20necessary%20in%20keeping%20people%20first%20while%20handling%20a%20crisis%20the%20scale%20of%20Covid-19%3A%20communication%2C%20co-\nordination%20and%20staying%20calm%2C%20says%20the%20Mint%20Group%20Crisis%20Communications%20Team.%0A%0Ahttps://www.itweb.co.za//content/PmxVE7Kl8prMQY85)\n\nClose Print\n\n[ITWeb Africa](http://www.itwebafrica.com/)\n[Brainstorm](http://www.brainstormmag.co.za) Cio Directory [The\nMargin](http://www.themargin.co.za/) [Career Web](http://www.careerweb.co.za/)\n[Training Web](http://www.trainingweb.co.za/)\n\n[Facebook icon ](https://www.facebook.com/ITWebZA/) [Twitter icon\n](https://twitter.com/ITWeb) [Google icon ](https://plus.google.com/+itweb)\n[Linkedin icon ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30318/) [Youtube play icon\n](https://www.youtube.com/user/ITWEBvideo) [RSS icon\n](https://www.itweb.co.za/rss)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1996 - 2020 ITWeb Limited.

Those high levels of the virus mean that the\ncoronavirus can infect others \"the moment you start to sneeze, you start to\ncough,\" she says.\n\nThis emerging picture of the disease may help to explain why the coronavirus\nappears to be spreading so rapidly. Research [from\nChina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748) shows it can take five or\neven 10 days for the first symptoms to emerge. Those in the very early stages\nof the disease continue to move through public places, unaware of the\npotential risk they pose. Even when symptoms start, they can be vague, similar\nto the cold and flu. Other\n[studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146694) from\n[China](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149768) show that some may never\nexperience symptoms at all. **** \"That makes the policy of case finding and\ncontainment very challenging,\" Koopmans says.\n\n[!['Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains\nHospitals](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/18/ap_20077405049336_sq-f6a2a38c397f02267678319e5ff2ca3b1d8268fe-s100-c15.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-\nsingle-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s)\n\n### [The Coronavirus Crisis ](https://www.npr.org/series/812054919/the-\ncoronavirus-crisis)\n\n### ['Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Deaths Pass\nChina's](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-\nmust-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s)\n\nKoopmans says that the revelation came for her while trying to conduct disease\nsurveillance in the Netherlands. Like many countries, the Netherlands\ninitially screened patients with a history of foreign travel. But when a\nhandful of untraceable cases appeared within the country, her team shifted\nstrategies and began to test health care workers in the hospitals where the\ncases were reported. They found that many were mildly ill \u2014 and already highly\ninfectious.\n\n\"People can have really mild complaints, just a cough, just a sore throat, and\nalready have a lot of virus [in their system],\" she says.\n\nAlfredo Garzino-Demo, a virologist based at the University of Maryland and\naffiliated with the University of Padua in Italy, says this characteristic,\nwhile not uncommon among viruses, makes this disease extremely hard to\ncontain. \"Many diseases have a window period in which you don't have symptoms\nbut you are still able to transmit,\" he says. **** \"But this one is\nparticularly serious.\"\n\nThe evolving view helps explain why countries are having to resort to such\nextreme social distancing measures to contain the spread of the disease. It\nalso highlights the need for broad testing of the general population, says\n[Marie-Paule Kieny](https://www.inserm.fr/en/research-inserm/meet-our-\nresearchers/inserm-prizes/marie-paule-kieny-2017-international-prize),\ndirector of research at Inserm, a French organization dedicated to the study\nof public health.\n\nWithout broad testing, \"we can't look at the community and say what percentage\nof the people have had contact with the virus,\" she says.

Garzino-\nDemo points to new, [not-yet-peer-reviewed\nresearch](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1) in\nrhesus macaques that appears to show that the virus does not cause\nreinfections. That's in line with what's known about other less deadly\ncoronaviruses, but the initial finding is still reassuring, he says. Koopmans\nsays that based on other such diseases, mild reinfection may sometimes happen,\nbut most people will experience the worst of it the first time around.\n\nAnd regarding the concern that the virus could mutate, **** Koopmans says that\ngenetic analysis by her lab shows that the virus is not mutating much and not\nin ways that would make it even more harmful. \"There's no real obvious changes\nthat would be of concern,\" she says.\n\nDespite the deep crisis faced by the world's public health systems, the\nscientists believe that the pandemic will eventually pass. Health care workers\nwill do their best to handle the surges in illness, scientists will rush\ntoward treatments and vaccines, and governments will try to support those in\nneed.\n\n\"There is a lot of generosity.

For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in\nadults.\n\nAnd a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have\nsymptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with\nHepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.\n\nSo, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system.\nThe children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to\nhave symptoms.\n\nIf studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that\nthere are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell\nus why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.\n\n**Q** _Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?_\n\n**A** That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if\nthey are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown\nthat while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the\nchildren are completely well, even though they tested positive.\n\nWe have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first\nperson to get it.\n\n> **If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you\n> are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically\n> possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We\n> think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major\n> driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the\n> disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.**\n\nIt is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the\nchild is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.\n\nIf you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are\nnot coughing, you are not making the droplets.\n\nIs it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks,\nfor instance?\n\nWe think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a\nmajor driver of the outbreak.\n\nThe money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are\ndiagnosed and isolated.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus microsite: Get latest updates, videos and graphics\n](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/wuhan-virus-follow-our-coverage)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: WHO warns world youth 'you are not\ninvincible'](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-who-warns-\nworld-youth-you-are-not-invincible)\n\nSo, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two\ndays, they will not spread it so much.\n\nIf it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well,\nthen they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.\n\nWe know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can\nbe an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has\nparents and grandparents who are older.\n\nEveryone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.\n\n#### Related Stories:\n\n![An 86-year-old resident of Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home at 1 Thomson Lane was\nconfirmed to have the coronavirus on March 31,\n2020.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/hzhome0331.jpg?itok=djSS7zZz)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [86-year-old resident of old age home among 47 new Covid-19 cases in\nSingapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-new-\ncovid-19-cluster-at-westlite-toh-guan-dormitory-linked-to-5-cases)\n\n![Office workers buying food to go at Amoy Street Food Centre on March 26,\n2020.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/hzlunch0331a_0.jpg?itok=SOqsf_jl)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Employers must allow staff to work from home or risk\npenalties](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-employers-in-\nsingapore-must-allow-staff-to-work-from-home-or-risk-penalties)\n\n![The baby arrived on March 30, and the Migrant Workers' Centre said that both\nmother and child are healthy and\nfine.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/yq-\nirrc-31032020.jpg?itok=c4XUn3s5)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: Wife of Bangladeshi worker still in ICU gives birth to baby\nboy](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-wife-of-bangladesh-\nworker-who-remains-in-icu-gives-birth-to-baby-boy)\n\n![Upon arrival in Singapore, the NUS students were transported directly from\nthe airport to their homes or hotels to serve their 14-day stay-home\nnotices.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/nz_nus_310353.jpg?itok=S8gS8atu)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [14 NUS students infected with Covid-19, all imported\ncases](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-14-nus-students-\ninfected-with-covid-19-all-imported-cases)\n\n![Siblings Lucas Low, four, and Hayley Low, eight, applauding in appreciation\nof Covid-19 front-line workers in Cantonment Road on March 30,\n2020.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/30/photo6055142995705047462.jpg?itok=lVb3sup5)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Singapore gives those on coronavirus front lines a round of\napplause](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-gives-coronavirus-\nfrontliners-a-round-of-applause)\n\n![Barbra Streisand tweeted: \"The Prime Minister of Singapore \\(a country that\nonly has three deaths out of six million people\\) speaks such common sense.

The current Covid-19 pandemic, however, is both contagious and\ndangerous. \"Therefore, we do need to think deeply for ourselves and also for\nsociety - what we want and how we are going to ensure that what we do will\nbuild these defences for the future.\n\n\"Public and personal hygiene is Singapore's first defence, not just against\nCovid-19 today, but against other (outbreaks) that we cannot foresee in the\nfuture,\" he added.\n\nThe new task force was launched earlier this month to raise cleanliness and\npublic hygiene levels, and to change people's habits to stop the spread of\ndisease.\n\nMr Masagos was one of four panellists who joined The Straits Times' science\nand environment correspondent Audrey Tan in an hour-long discussion around the\ntheme of \"Keep clean, to keep well\", which was aired as a special episode of\nST's talk show, The Big Story.\n\nThe other experts were Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment\nAgency's (NEA) Department of Public Cleanliness; Mr Edward D'Silva, chairman\nof the Public Hygiene Council; and Professor Wang Linfa, director of the\nemerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.\n\nProf Wang explained why frequent hand-washing is an effective tool in battling\nthe virus.\n\nThe virus has a lipid membrane on the outer layer that keeps it intact, said\nProf Wang, and many of the cleaning agents - such as soaps and hand sanitisers\n- can dissolve this lipid membrane.\n\n\"All of these (cleaning agents) will not only clean the environment in the\nsort of general sense. More specifically for this Covid-19, you can actually\ndisrupt the virus and prevent the transmission.\"\n\nMr D'Silva said technology can help to plug a manpower gap in the pool of\ncleaners here, such as the recent one caused by the lockdown imposed by\nMalaysia earlier this month.\n\nMr Masagos pointed out that because of these new circumstances, there was also\na need to establish new social norms in places such as hawker centres and\nplaces of worship - with some practices possibly here for good.\n\nBesides personal hygiene and the need to adjust norms, Mr Tai also shared that\nNEA has been working to raise cleaning standards across the island. This\nincludes examining how cleaning companies can boost cleaning efforts not just\nin places where a case has been detected, but also in areas with high human\ntraffic.\n\nIn the discussion, Mr Masagos said that while Singaporeans are worried about\nCovid-19, they must not lose sight of the fight against an equally dangerous\ndisease: dengue fever.\n\nSince the start of this year, there have been more than 4,000 cases of dengue\ninfections here, double that of the same period last year.\n\nThe panel also spoke about the rate of transmission of Covid-19 and its role\nin \"flattening\" the epidemic curve, or containing the outbreak.\n\nHow the curve will behave depends on how efficiently each country's government\nand each individual in a society can work together and bring down the rate of\ntransmission, said Prof Wang.\n\nThe panel also touched on the best and worst hygiene habits of Singaporeans.\nMr Masagos said that while most Singaporeans do not litter, they tend not to\nhave good habits such as returning food trays and keeping the table clean for\nthe next user.\n\n\"We are a First World country. But let's be honest (about) whether we are\nalready a First World people where hygiene and cleanliness are concerned.\"\n\n* * *\n\n#### Importance of personal, environmental hygiene\n\nWhat does clearing your tray have to do with fighting the coronavirus? And has\nthe Covid-19 outbreak helped in fighting climate change? **The Straits Times**\nsat down with four experts - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources\nMasagos Zulkifli, the Public Hygiene Council's chairman Edward D'Silva,\ndirector of the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Department of Public\nCleanliness Tai Ji Choong and director of the emerging infectious diseases\nprogramme at Duke-NUS Medical School Wang Linfa - to find out more.\n\n**Q: What does tray return have to do with my health?**\n\n**Professor Wang:** Infectious materials are living organisms that thrive on\nfood. The longer you leave contaminants on the table, the higher the chances\nof someone coming into contact with them.\n\n**Q: What is one of the worst hygiene habits people here have?**\n\n**Mr Masagos:** Until recently, even myself, after I eat in a hawker centre, I\nwill put my tissue paper inside (my bowl) and I think that is not littering,\nit is just keeping it away from the floor and so forth. But I am beginning to\nrecognise that these are also what I call little biohazards that you leave on\nthe table sometimes or even in your bowl.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Personal hygiene can help to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and flatten\nthe epidemic curve:\nExperts](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/personal-hygiene-can-\nhelp-to-reduce-the-spread-of-covid-19-and-help-flatten-the)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Covid-19 not a solution to climate change, clearing one's tray can help\nfight coronavirus spread:\nExperts](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/covid-19-not-a-\nsolution-to-climate-change-clearing-ones-tray-can-help-fight)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus 101: What do you want to\nknow?](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-101-what-do-\nyou-want-to-know)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus microsite: Get latest updates, videos and graphics\n](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/wuhan-virus-follow-our-coverage)\n\nEat on a tray so that if the food falls out of your bowl, it falls on the\ntray, and then when you return the tray, the table is clean for the next\nperson. At the same time, cleaners do not have to clean up after you.\n\n**Q: Is 'I cannot find a bin' a valid excuse for littering?**\n\n**Mr Tai:** Well, just counting the public bins that are owned by NEA, we\nalready have over 11,000 bins - and these don't include town council bins.\n\nShopping malls have their own bins. MRT stations have their own bins. So,\nactually, Singapore has no shortage of bins. And the bins are actually within\nvery easy reach.\n\nSo, there is really no reason for a person to say: \"I cannot find a bin, so I\njust drop (my litter).\"\n\n**Q: What changes are being made to Singapore's hawker centres to encourage\ncleaner practices?**\n\n**Mr D'Silva:** We realise that when customers finish their food, if you want\nthem to clear their trays, the tray-return facility should be as close as\npossible to them so that they don't have to walk a long way.\n\nThese are just behavioural patterns. So, I think this is something which we\ncan learn and we can improve on.\n\nCleaning operators will have to also upskill themselves, and we need to see\nhow we can help them mechanise to some extent, and at the same time educate\nand promote awareness among their own cleaners... (Cleaners) can do a much\nbetter, efficient job if they are doing things other than just clearing your\ntrays.\n\nSo, I think these are little things that we can tweak in the months ahead.\n\n**Q: How do cleaning agents and disinfectants help fight the virus?**\n\n**Prof Wang:** The virus has a lipid membrane outside, and for the virus to\nremain intact, it needs to maintain the lipid.\n\nMany cleaning agents can dissolve this lipid, so that is why it is very\nimportant that we wash our hands either with soap or a sanitiser or 70 per\ncent ethanol.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Five lessons from fighting\nCovid-19](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/five-lessons-from-fighting-\ncovid-19)\n\nAll of these will not only clean the environment in the general sort of sense\nbut, more specifically for Covid-19, you can actually disrupt the virus and\nthen prevent its transmission.\n\n**Q: Can Covid-19 help lower global emissions and fight climate change?**\n\n**Mr Masagos:** Even if there is a positive impact on climate change, the cost\nto lives is huge, and I don't think we should be celebrating this.\n\nWe have set the world on this journey of reducing emissions and then getting\nready to adapt.\n\nWe must do everything we can now in our personal habits to use as little\nenergy as possible, reduce our waste, recycle our waste, put it into the\ncircular economy. At the same time, we look to new opportunities and new\nsolutions. Fossil fuel versus, say, hydrogen.\n\nAll these are very great ideas that we should not dismiss and stop talking\nabout.\n\n**Timothy Goh**\n\n#### Related Stories:\n\n![Ten new cases are linked to the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home at 1 Thomson\nLane.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/04/01/ychome010420.jpg?itok=IGmLpnhl)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus cases in S\u2019pore hit 1,000; 10 new cases from old folks' home\nincluding a 102-year-old](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/74-new-\ncoronavirus-cases-in-spore-bringing-total-to-1000-54-new-cases-are-local-\nwith-10)\n\n![Office workers buying food to go at Amoy Street Food Centre on March 26,\n2020.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/hzlunch0331a_0.jpg?itok=SOqsf_jl)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Employers must allow staff to work from home or risk\npenalties](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-employers-in-\nsingapore-must-allow-staff-to-work-from-home-or-risk-penalties)\n\n![The baby arrived on March 30, and the Migrant Workers' Centre said that both\nmother and child are healthy and\nfine.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/yq-\nirrc-31032020.jpg?itok=c4XUn3s5)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: Wife of Bangladeshi worker still in ICU gives birth to baby\nboy](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-wife-of-bangladesh-\nworker-who-remains-in-icu-gives-birth-to-baby-boy)\n\n![Upon arrival in Singapore, the NUS students were transported directly from\nthe airport to their homes or hotels to serve their 14-day stay-home\nnotices.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/31/nz_nus_310353.jpg?itok=S8gS8atu)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [14 NUS students infected with Covid-19, all imported\ncases](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-14-nus-students-\ninfected-with-covid-19-all-imported-cases)\n\n![Siblings Lucas Low, four, and Hayley Low, eight, applauding in appreciation\nof Covid-19 front-line workers in Cantonment Road on March 30,\n2020.](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2020/03/30/photo6055142995705047462.jpg?itok=lVb3sup5)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Singapore gives those on coronavirus front lines a round of\napplause](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-gives-coronavirus-\nfrontliners-a-round-of-applause)\n\n![Barbra Streisand tweeted: \"The Prime Minister of Singapore \\(a country that\nonly has three deaths out of six million people\\) speaks such common sense.

On every episode, we invite the most interesting\npeople in waste recycling and organics to sit down with us and chat candidly\nabout their thoughts, their work, this unique industry and so much more.\nThanks for listening and enjoy this episode.\n\n[music]\n\n**[00:00:28] Liz:**  Hi everyone, this is Liz Bothwell from Waste360 with Joss\nMann, Public Sector Solutions Manager at Waste Management. Hi, Josh and thanks\nfor being on the show today.\n\n**[00:00:39] Josh Mann:  **Thanks for having me on, Liz. I'd say it's a\nsurreal moment for me, I've listened to the past episodes and I never really\nthought I'll be in the same cohort as my fellow Waste Management folks, Like\nSusan Robinson, Tara Hemmer or people like Adam Minter. Kind of crazy, but\nhere I am.\n\n**[00:01:03] Liz:**  Well, good for you, and it's well deserved for sure.\n[laughs] To get it started, I'd love to hear a little bit about your\nbackground and how you found yourself working in this great industry.\n\n**[00:01:16] Josh:  **Yes. I'd obviously been familiar with Waste Management\nprior to joining the company, but my entrance into the industry was certainly\nnot planned or expected. My background was really in economic development, I\nworked basically on a local level assisting businesses with either starting\nnew projects, expanding, or even just retaining what they had.\n\nI did that for a couple of economic development groups and then I went to work\nfor a public affairs firm that specialized in land-use planning, which gave me\nsome really great insight into how the regulatory world works. Then, from\nthere actually made the jump into the tax world, spent some time working for a\nstate tax agency and never really thought much more about the waste and\nrecycling industry other than rolling my carts out to the curb on collection\nday. Obviously, as a kid, I recycled my bottles and cans to buy some ice cream\nand that sort of thing.\n\nI had a chance encounter actually with a good friend of mine very involved in\nthe communities where I work and I had basically-- took a lunch with somebody\nthat was looking for some advice on to help out with the project I was doing\nfor our local YMCA. Basically, as soon as we sat down to lunch, she said, \"Are\nyou interested in making a career change?\" And I said, \"What do you mean?\" She\nsaid, \"Well, I heard about this position at Waste Management and I thought you\nwould be perfect.\"\n\nI just looked at her and I said, \"Are you sure? I have no background in the\nwaste or recycling industry.\" She said, \"Don't worry about that. You have a\npassion for doing good things in the community and you work hard. They can\nteach you about the industry, they can't replace those intrinsic parts to\nbeing good at your job.\" Ultimately, she saw something in me and the next day\nI received a call from someone at Waste Management. They just confirmed my\ninterest, from there I interviewed and five years later here I am.\n\n**[00:03:59] Liz:**  That's amazing. Clearly, she saw something special and\nthose intangibles can't really be overlooked, that's what makes people do the\njob that they do and that passion fuels you, for sure. That's awesome. We're\nthankful in the industry that you made it here. [laughs]\n\n**[00:04:17] Josh:**  It's a trend that I'm seeing more and more in our\nindustry, especially here at Waste Management, is that it's about finding the\nmost talented people, the most passionate people at what they do, and\nsometimes they can be found within the industry and sometimes they're coming\nin from outside the industry, but I'm noticing a change. Especially, here in\nmy role where we're bringing in some just really amazing talented driven\npeople.\n\n**[00:04:49] Liz:  **That's great. Congrats on being one of this year's\nesteemed 40 Under 40 winners. I have to say your nomination was impressive and\nyou were referred to as a real game-changer, which is an amazing way for\nsomeone to describe a person. Can you dig a little bit into the work you're\ndoing in Waste Management and tell us more about that?\n\n**[00:05:13] Josh:  **Certainly. My role here with Waste Management is\nspecifically, I design and manage municipal collection programs for our\nfranchise customers here in Southern California. It's the bread and butter for\nour business, but it's actually fairly unique when you get down to it. I have\nto take basically our experience as a company, our resources, our\ncapabilities, and then I got to distill that down into the actual services\nthat we provide to meet the needs of our customers and the goals of the\ncommunities that we serve.\n\nI've come to refer to it as a switch army position here at Waste Management. I\ndon't directly handle the customer service, I've never driven a collection\nvehicle, I visited an MRF, but I don't know down to the detail of how the\nmaterial gets processed, but I need to have an innate sense of how that all\ncomes together. It is truly a game-changer role in terms of, in the last\ncouple of years I've had the opportunity to take communities that maybe didn't\nhave recycling programs or didn't have great recycling programs, basically,\ncreate and launch those programs and really take those communities to the next\nlevel.\n\nWe've been able to partner with communities on projects that were important to\nthem, whether it was cleaning up their community or establishing programs to\nhelp educate young people about sustainability, those are the opportunities\nthat being here at Waste Management and in the role that I'm in, that I have\nthe ability to take a first-hand role and seeing through.\n\n**[00:07:08] Liz:  **That's great. I know you're doing some work with organics\nrecycling, can you tell us how your organic recycling programs are going? I\ncan't believe 2020 is already here and I know California is pushing for\ndiverting 75% of organic waste and recyclables from the waste streams. How is\nthat going?\n\n**[00:07:28] Josh:**  Yes. I think it's pretty fair to say that there's never\nbeen a more dynamic time to be in the industry, and probably no more\nchallenging a place in the country to be in the industry than California. But\nI am very thankful that I get to do it on behalf of Waste Management, we're\nvery, very engaged in the policy changes that have taken place in California,\nI really have seen the shift.\n\nI think in a lot of ways, we've gone from a lot of education and good faith\nefforts to real tangible programs that are helping to divert out organic\nwaste. I know that throughout our Southern California area, we've got a lot of\ndifferent ways that we're approaching it based on the resources and\ncapabilities we have available. We're also striking those partnerships that\nhelp basically pave the way for additional organics diversion to occur.\n\nThen definitely working with our communities, the cities, counties and special\ndistricts that we serve to really build out the rest of those diversion\nprograms on knowing that while today California is very focused on the waste\nstream generated by commercial businesses and multifamily properties that were\nnot too far off from it extending to basically every generator in California.\nIt's certainly, a tall task and it's not going to happen overnight, but we're\nseeing some great progress communities that have stepped up to the plate and\nembraced the change.\n\nIt's opened a lot of doors of communication with our customers. The fact that\nbased on the regulatory changes and things they're reading in the news,\nthey're certainly asking a lot more questions about their waste stream and\ntheir opportunities to see that more of it goes to places other than\nlandfills. I have the great privilege of helping to deliver a lot of those\nsolutions on a community-wide base.\n\n**[00:10:02] Liz:**  That's great. Speaking of educating residents, do you\nhave any tips on doing that? Because I know that's a huge part of cleaning up\nthe contamination.\n\n**[00:10:15] Josh:**  Yes. Here at Waste Management, contamination is one of\nour primary focuses for helping to ease the challenges we're seeing in the\nrecycling industry. To that extent, several years ago folks like Susan\nRobinson really helped to break things down, that's how we ended up with our\nRecycle Right Campaign, really focusing on those items that I think we all\nknow are recyclable and yet we're not capturing nearly as much of that stream\nas we should be.\n\nThen, at the same time, finding those game-changer items that if we could get\nthose out of the recycling stream would make the ability to process and\nobviously, get material moved on to their next life that much easier.\n\nFor my role, it's really a multi-pronged approach. Certainly, from the\nstandpoint of educating customers through our digital resources and materials\nthat we would distribute through our correspondence with our customers. Really\ndown to actually one on one type of situations where you're doing workshops,\nyou're doing site visits to customers and you're actually going to their waste\ncontainer and doing an impromptu audit as you're taking stock of what the\nopportunities are.\n\nUltimately, I think that it's the combination of those steps that were\nconsistently reminding residents and businesses of what is recyclable and how\nthey can improve their recycling performance. But also that next step of going\nout and physically looking in containers, and giving direct recommendations\nbased on their waste stream.\n\n**[00:12:25] Liz:**  That's super helpful and concrete, which is great. Then,\nJosh, how about cannabis? I read that you're working on solutions there as\nwell, can you expand on any solutions you're seeing?\n\n**[00:12:39] Josh:**  Yes. Here in California, we had some changes in state\nlaw that obviously has expanded and legalized the cannabis industry. In my\narea, we've got a couple of jurisdictions that have basically started that\nprocess of licensing businesses that are in that industry and are basically,\nsetting up to accommodate that waste stream.\n\nPart of what we've been doing is really figuring out the steps forward, such\nthat we're dividing out those materials that are really organic in nature, and\ndon't pose any impacts to the regular waste stream, and coming up with a\ncollection program that can be tailored to the needs of those individual\ncustomers. It's still a very boutique industry, and the fact that there aren't\na lot of standards from business to business depending on where they're at in\nthe development of cannabis materials, whether they're a grower, a processor\nor a retailer, that coming up with something that can be sized to their\nparticular business.\n\nAlso, developing the programs for those materials that are potentially going\nto pose or do pose an impact to the environment. Making sure that we're\ncarefully delineating those out and also, meeting the regulations that the\nstate has set to ensure that those materials get properly disposed of. To that\nextent, it's been interesting, it's certainly new challenge in terms of an\nindustry just because really is in its startup phase here in California.\n\nWe're learning as we go in terms of being able to really step up and respond\nto the changes and needs of that industry. What I can say though is that it\ndoes offer a new opportunity both for us as a business, as well as for a\ndiversion stream. I know that working with our municipal partners, they're\nlooking for those opportunities as well and so it really is a great\npartnership for us.\n\n**[00:14:59] Liz:**  I like that, you have to keep us posted as that moves\nalong because I know it's a new frontier for everyone.\n\n**[00:15:04]**   **Josh:**  Yes. Certainly, because of the approach of the\nstate of California is taking, is that we have to be very detailed in our\napproach, while in a lot of ways the waste stream may pose no environmental\nchallenges, that there are certainly a lot of regulatory ones.\n\nFrom that extent, we want to make sure that we're keeping ourselves safe as a\nservice provider, we're keeping our customers safe. Obviously, they're looking\nfor our assistance and delivering that service, then taking care of our\ncommunities, it's something that has been, certainly, a challenge for us, one\nthat I think ultimately, we're going to move forward on and we're going to be\nable to manage very successfully.\n\n**[00:15:58]  Liz: **Great, I'm sure you will. Speaking of new frontiers, it's\nobvious the waste industry is shifting, I'm sure you've seen that in the five\nyears you've been in it, with regulations technology, even customer\nexpectations changing regularly. How are you and your team coping and/or\nthriving? And what opportunities do you see, Josh?\n\n**[00:16:21]**   **Josh:**  It is an exciting time to be in the industry. I\nknow from the work that I do that there is a lot more conversations\nsurrounding the idea of sustainability, getting really down to the details of\nthe waste stream and looking for those opportunities. Those conversations have\nbeen really positive, they know that waste management is the industry leader\nin making that happen. They're really looking to us to be the subject matter\nexperts in what they can do, that's been certainly exciting.\n\nI know here at Waste Management that we're seeing a culture shift within the\ncompany, people first approached the president, the CEO, Jim Fish has taken is\nreally starting to show itself on a day-to-day basis. I take a look at our\nSenior Leadership Team and our leadership at the market area levels and\nthere's definitely an esprit de corps there. These are people that are not\njust good at their job, they're not just good here at Waste Management,\nthey're good, period. These are the leaders that are going to be able to move\nthe company forward.\n\nYou talk about embracing technology. Every day it seems like we're adding to\nour skill set from a technology standpoint, I know that more and more of our\ncustomers are looking for those opportunities to be able to customize their\nservice. They are embracing the digital options that they have through Waste\nManagement, and it's been exciting to see that, in terms of the customers\nthemselves, I think, are changing.\n\nEspecially here in California, there's a diversity of backgrounds, there's a\ndiversity of industries; I think that in terms of how we approach that, even\nthough a lot of our services, especially in the work that I do, are very\nstandardized, in terms of making sure that they can be delivered and repeated\nbasically into perpetuity. There's a level of customization that has been\nadded in recent years that allows people to have the service that suits their\nneeds.\n\nI think that we're only going to continue to move in that direction where the\nwork that we do is reflective of the customers or wanting us to go. To some\nextent, we have to anticipate those needs, we keep an eye on what's going on\nin the regulatory environment, we also keep an eye on what's going on in terms\nof advancements and technology. Certainly, always adding to our skill sets and\ncapabilities such that we'll be able to meet the needs of our customers today,\ntomorrow and basically so long there's a waste stream to collect and process.\n\n**[00:19:49]  Liz:** Right. Josh, one of the things that stood out to us on\nyour nomination for the 40 Under 40 Award was that you've been described as\nreally seeing your career as a calling for environmental and social change. Do\nyou see it that way?\n\n**[00:20:04]**   **Josh:**  I really do. I think that one of the things that\nmake me feel at home, here at Waste Management. I talked about the People-\nFirst Culture and I think in a lot of ways, the kinds of people that Waste\nManagement is both looking for and developing are people that are drawn to the\ncompany because it has a social purpose.\n\nCertainly, in the face of it, yes. We certainly provide some very necessary\nservices to our customers. But I think a lot of that is driven through the\nfact that they see Waste Management as a company that it's very mission-\ndriven. I know that for me, that's what kept me here, here in my role, in\ndoing the work that I do is that I see Waste Management as a company that is\nembracing change.\n\nWe take a look at the issues we face at the local level, as well as worldwide.\nIt's going to take companies like Waste Management stepping up to the plate,\nand finding that path forward is not only good for business but is good for\nour communities and is good for the environment.\n\nI think that that's the approach that the company has taken and really made it\nknown that that's what it stands for.  It makes me proud to work for Waste\nManagement. I really see the work that I do as contributing to that change and\nmake the communities that I get to work with and the environment just that\nmuch better.\n\n**[00:22:10]**   **Liz:  **Absolutely, that's great. Then Josh, what advice do\nyou have for people entering this industry?\n\n**[00:22:16]**   **Josh:**  For those folks who may be thinking about getting\ninto this industry or hadn't previously thought about it, but based on\nsomething they read or interest they have, that there are really great\nopportunities in waste and recycling. I look at the companies that are in our\nindustry today and the opportunities are nearly endless, I think that they're\nlooking for top talent and a variety of skill sets.\n\nIf you're one of those people, like myself, who value a company that is\nengaged in delivering environmental and social change, the companies like\nWaste Management may be a great place for you. I think that traditionally, the\nwaste and recycling industry has been seen as a place for those folks that are\nmaybe, without specific training or education in terms of their background. I\nwould say that while there are opportunities to start out on the ground floor,\nthat if you have a skill set about any other aspect of business, there are\nopportunities for you.\n\nI take a look at our Senior Leadership Team, I know that Tara Hemmer was on a\nprevious episode, I know you talked to Devina Rankin, these are people that\nthey're just great at what they do and they have had the opportunity at Waste\nManagement to develop in their roles, now they're leading the company. I think\nthat if there is any great example of what's capable of being done in this\nindustry, its people that are- if you're passionate, if you're ambitious, if\nyou're authentic, I think that waste and recycling may be the industry for\nyou.\n\n**[00:24:33]**   **Liz:**  I love that, combining your talents and then the\npassion, I think that's great advice, Josh. Do you think there's anything else\nwe should be paying attention to in the world of waste recycling and organics?\n\n**[00:24:46]**   **Josh:**  From my standpoint, there is so much that's going\non, specifically, important to me is reminding people about that need to\noperate safely. It's really been ingrained in our culture here at Waste\nManagement, as it is at many other companies in the industry, is that we are\nentrusted with serving communities throughout the country, I think the most\nimportant thing that we can do is operate safely.\n\nTo that extent, I know that Waste Management goes out of its way to make sure\nthat in whatever we do, we are operating safely, that we're doing things right\nthe first time. It's something that definitely comes through in the work that\nI do, we're on the roads in cities and towns, here in Southern California and\nsafety is really at the forefront of what we do. It's something I think we\nneed to continue to be focused on. I know that recently some\n**[unintelligible 00:26:13]**  came out, was a reminder that even for all the\nstrides that we've made as an industry, that we've still got a ways to go.\n\n**[00:26:23]**   **Liz:**  That's great, safety first. Definitely agree with\nthat. Josh, I know you do so much work with municipalities and you're very\nclose to the customers in your regions. What do you find is their biggest pain\npoint? And how do you connect with them on a level where they know that you're\ngoing to meet their needs?\n\nThese public sector folks are so busy, the waste stream is just part of their\njob and recycling is just part of their job. How do you get through to them\nand connect with them?\n\n**[00:26:55]**   **Josh:**  In the work that I do I have a great opportunity\nto interact with the customers that we serve on a daily basis. The\nconversations that I have, the feedback that I get that helps to shape the\nprograms that we offer. In some cases, folks are not excited about the changes\nin the waste and recycling industry, a lot of that is driven by regulations. I\nthink really what they're looking for is the reassurance that they're going to\nbe able to get over those hurdles, whatever they may be, at their home or at\ntheir business.\n\nI think that they're looking for the direct path forward to be able to do\nthat. In my role, that's what I get to do, is distilled down those\nopportunities, those challenges and help develop programs that customers\neither are really excited about and want or are understanding that it's\nnecessary for their community and their environment. I think the great part\nabout what I get to do is that I get to have those conversations on a daily\nbasis and get that feedback to ensure that ultimately we're delivering on all\nof those counts.\n\n**[00:28:28]**   **Liz:  **Sure. What keeps you busy outside of work?\n\n**[00:28:32]**   **Josh:**  Well, like a lot of people over the Christmas\nholiday, I received an Adam Minter new book, I'm reading all about where\ndonated things go, it's always very insightful. In addition to that, I got\nmarried last year, my wife and I were both very career-driven which doesn't\nleave a lot of free time but for the time we do getaway, we try to do a little\nbit of traveling. Exciting to go and visit places in the last couple of years,\nwe've got a couple of trips planned, including, hopefully, New Orleans here in\nMay for WasteExpo.\n\n**[00:29:20]**   **Liz:**  Awesome, that's great. You have to bring your wife\nto the 40 Under 40 reception.\n\n**[00:29:27]**   **Josh:  **Yes. She was the first one to ask, \"When are we\ngoing?\" And, \"Can I be there?\"\n\n**[00:29:34]**   **Liz:**  [laughs] That's great. Well, I look forward to\nmeeting her, that's fantastic. Well, Josh, thanks so much for your time today,\nit's going to be great for everyone to hear how one of our wonderful 40 Under\n40 looks at the industry, spends his time and how passionate you are. Congrats\nagain on your award and keep up the great work. I really look forward to\nseeing you and at WasteExpo.\n\n[music]  \n\n\n\n[0 comments](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\nHide comments\n\n![](https://www.waste360.com/sites/all/themes/penton_core_theme/images/account-\ndefault-image.png)\n\n[](/)\n\nComment *\n\n[Switch to plain text editor](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\n[More information about text formats](/filter/tips)\n\nText format  CommentsPlain text\n\n### Comments\n\n  * Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p>\n\n### Plain text\n\n  * No HTML tags allowed.\n  * Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.\n  * Lines and paragraphs break automatically.\n\nPublish[Log in or register to comment](/penton_modal/nojs/login)\n\nSave\n\nLeave this field blank\n\nRelated\n\nSponsored Content\n\n  * [Load More](/resources/get-glimpse-future-waste-recycling?parent=49109&infscr=1)\n\n[](/)\n\n[](https://informa.com/)\n\n  * [About](/about-us)\n  * [Contact Us](/contact)\n  * [Advertise](https://www.waste360.com/digital-advertising)\n\n  * [Ad Choices](https://engage.informa.com/privacy-statement/#ThirdPartyAdvertisingTech)\n  * [Sitemap](/sitemap)\n\nFollow us:\n\n[__](https://twitter.com/Waste360\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.facebook.com/WasteExpo/\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=4818703&trk=anet_ug_hm&goback=.gm\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](http://waste360.com/rss.xml\n\"RSS\")[__](https://www.google.co.in/\n\"Google\")[__](https://soundcloud.com/nothingwasted\n\"Soundcloud\")[__](https://in.youtube.com/ \"Youtube\")\n\n[](http://www.informamarkets.com/)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020\\.

In addition, Illinois extended its tax filing and payment deadline\n(but not the deadline to make estimated tax payments) to match the IRS July 15\ndeadline.\n\n### **Current IRS Operational Status**\n\nAlthough the IRS is curtailing certain operations, it is continuing to provide\nmission-critical functions, including accepting tax returns and sending\nrefunds. The following is a summary of the current status of IRS operations:\n\n  * _Offices closed_. Many IRS offices have closed, and many IRS employees have begun working remotely.\n\n  * _In-Person assistance suspended_. The IRS has suspended nearly all face-to-face contacts with taxpayers. All Taxpayer Assistance Centers have closed and all face-to-face TAC appointments have been cancelled. The IRS will try to resolve the needs of those taxpayers with TAC appointments already scheduled by phone instead.\n\n  * _Automated services functional_. IRS automated applications remain available.\n\n  * _Telephone assistance available but limited_. Although limited live telephone customer service is available, there are lengthy wait times. Similarly, there are likely to be extended wait times for the Practitioner Priority Service line.\n\n  * _Mailed correspondence subject to lengthy processing times_. While the IRS remains able to receive mail, responses to paper correspondence will be very limited. Longer wait times should be expected, both during the COVID-19 shutdown and afterwards, as the IRS works through any correspondence backlog.\n\n  * _Statutes of limitations_. The IRS will continue working with cases where statutes of limitation are pending, including requesting extensions of the limitations period where needed.\n\n  * _Office of Chief Counsel and Tax Court Case Management_. The Office of Chief Counsel is continuing to work on resolving Tax Court cases in litigation and supporting other IRS operating divisions. Although Chief Counsel attorneys are not meeting with taxpayers or lawyers face-to-face, they remain available to discuss cases by telephone.\n\n  * _Office of Appeals_. Appeals employees are also continuing to work on their cases. Conferences may be held by telephone or videoconference. Taxpayers should respond as promptly as possible to any outstanding requests for information from Appeals.\n\n  * _Taxpayer advocate service available but limited_. The Taxpayer Advocate Service remains open to receive phone calls at local phone numbers, but walk-in services are suspended, and the toll-free central number is unavailable.\n\n  * _Tax-exempt sector functions operational_. The IRS is continuing to accept and process applications for recognition of tax exemption for exempt organizations, rulings and determinations for employee plans, and closing agreements for municipal issuers.\n\n### **What Do These Operational Changes at the IRS Mean for Taxpayers?**\n\nFirst, the IRS is continuing to process refunds. Taxpayers due a tax refund\nshould consider filing their returns as soon as possible.\n\nSecond, because of expected delays in processing paper returns, it is\nadvisable that taxpayers file and pay any tax due electronically. Taxpayers\ndue a refund should indicate bank direct deposit information on their return\nto receive their refund directly.\n\nThird, the IRS has postponed the due date for federal income tax returns and\ntax payments originally due on April 15 to July 15 (see our [March 20\nalert](https://www.schiffhardin.com/insights/publications/2020/irs-formalizes-\ntax-filing-deadline-to-july-15 \"March 20 alert\")). This postponement is\nautomatic, **although taxpayers requiring additional time to file their\nreturns beyond July 15 should file an extension request, which will extend the\ndeadline through the fall.**\n\nFourth, the July 15 income tax payment and filing postponement only applies to\nfederal taxes. State taxes and returns may be subject to different deadlines.\nSome states (including California, D.C., Illinois, and New York) have already\nfollowed the federal postponement or undertaken postponements on their own\ninitiative. Other states (such as Michigan) have not yet followed suit.\nHowever, even among states that have followed the federal postponement, some\nvariability exists. For instance, Illinois, which on March 25 announced the\nextension of its state income tax filing and payment deadlines, specifically\ndid not extend the deadline for making 2020 estimated tax payments (unlike the\nIRS, which postponed the first quarter estimated tax payment deadline).\n\n#### **People First Initiative**\n\nOn March 25, the IRS announced its new People First Initiative (PFI). The PFI\nincludes changes to audit and collection procedures, effective beginning April\n1 and running through July 15. The following are the highlights of the new\nPFI:\n\n#### **Installment Agreements**\n\n  * _Existing installment agreements_. For taxpayers under an existing installment agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15 are suspended. Those who currently are unable to comply with the terms of an installment payment agreement, including a direct deposit installment agreement, may suspend payments during this period if they prefer. The IRS will not default any installment agreements during this time, although interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances, as required by law.\n\n  * _New installment agreements_. The IRS is encouraging taxpayers who are unable to fully pay their federal taxes that they can resolve their outstanding liabilities by entering into a monthly payment agreement.\n\n#### **Offers in Compromise (OIC)**\n\n  * _Pending OIC applications_. The IRS will allow taxpayers until July 15 to provide requested additional information to support a pending OIC. The IRS also will not close any pending OIC requests before July 15 without the taxpayer\u2019s consent.\n\n  * _OIC payments_. Taxpayers may suspend all payments on accepted OICs until July 15, although interest will continue to accrue.\n\n  * _Delinquent tax return filings_. The IRS will not default an OIC for taxpayers who are delinquent in filing their tax returns for the 2018 tax year, although taxpayers should file any delinquent 2018 returns (and their 2019 returns) by July 15.\n\n  * _New OIC applications_. The IRS is encouraging people facing a liability exceeding their net worth to consider using the OIC process.\n\n**Non-Filers Encouraged to File.** The IRS is encouraging people who have not\nyet filed returns for pre-2019 tax years to file any late returns. The IRS\nnotes that more than 1 million households that have not filed tax returns\nduring the last three years are owed refunds, and there is still time to claim\nthose refunds.\n\n**Field Collection Activities Mostly Suspended.** Liens and levies (including\nseizures of personal residences) initiated by IRS field revenue officers will\nbe suspended from April 1 through July 15, although field officers will\ncontinue to pursue high-income non-filers and perform other similar activities\nas required.\n\n**Automated Liens and Levies Suspended.** New automatic liens and levies will\nbe suspended from April 1 through July 15.\n\n**Passport Certifications to the State Department Suspended.** The IRS will\nsuspend new certifications to the U.S. Department of State for \u201cseriously\ndelinquent\u201d taxpayers from April 1 through July 15. Seriously delinquent\ntaxpayers are those who have an unpaid federal tax debt (including interest\nand penalties) exceeding $53,000, for which all administrative remedies have\nbeen exhausted and which is not currently subject to a collection alternative\n(that is, an installment agreement or OIC). If a seriously delinquent tax debt\nhas been certified to the State Department by the IRS, the taxpayer may be\ndenied a passport. The IRS is encouraging these taxpayers to submit\ninstallment agreement or OIC requests during this time.\n\n**Private Debt Collection Referrals Suspended.** The IRS will not forward new\ndelinquent accounts to private collection agencies from April 1 through July\n15.\n\n_Audits Restricted_. From April 1 through July 15, the IRS generally will not\nstart new field, office, or correspondence examinations, except where deemed\nnecessary to preserve applicable statutes of limitations. The IRS will\ncontinue to process refund claims where possible, without in-person contact.\n\n  * _In-person meetings suspended_. Examination-related in-person meetings will be suspended, although ongoing examinations will continue remotely where possible. The IRS is encouraging taxpayers to respond to any IRS information requests as promptly as possible.\n\n  * _Unique situations affecting corporate and business taxpayers_. Where corporate and business taxpayers wish to begin an examination while people and records are available and respective staffs have capacity, the IRS may initiate new examinations, with the understanding that COVID-19 developments may reduce activities for an agreed period.\n\n  * _Taxpayers should continue to respond to general information requests_. The IRS is encouraging taxpayers to respond to any other IRS correspondence requesting additional information during the examination suspension period, as possible.\n\n_Earned Income Tax Credit and Wage Verification Requests_. Taxpayers have\nuntil July 15 to respond to the IRS to verify that they qualify for the EITC\nor to verify their income. Taxpayers who are unable to do so should reach out\nto the IRS indicating the reason why that information is unavailable. Until\nJuly 15, the IRS will not deny these credits for a failure to provide the\nrequested information.\n\n### **Illinois Extends Income Tax Filing and Payment Deadline**\n\nThe State of Illinois yesterday announced that it is following the federal\ngovernment\u2019s lead in extending the tax filing and payment deadline for all\ntaxpayers from April 15 to July 15. This relief applies to all individual\nreturns, trusts, and corporations and is automatic, requiring no action on the\npart of taxpayers. Penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any unpaid\nbalances beginning on July 16.\n\nIt is worth observing that, unlike the federal government, which postponed\nuntil July 15 the deadline for estimated taxes for the first quarter of 2020,\nIllinois specifically did not extend the deadlines for making any estimated\ntax payments.\n\n\u00a9 2020 Schiff Hardin LLP\n\n  *   * [Printer-friendly](/print/article/irs-updates-operational-status-and-introduces-people-first-initiative-and-illinois \"Display a printer-friendly version of this page.\")\n  * [Email this Article](/printmail/article/irs-updates-operational-status-and-introduces-people-first-initiative-and-illinois \"Send this page by email.\")\n  * [Download PDF](/printpdf/125229 \"Display a PDF version of this page.\")\n  * [REPRINTS & PERMISSIONS](/reprints-and-permissions \"REPRINTS & PERMISSIONS\")\n\n## TRENDING LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n[COVID-19: Guide to Australia Taxation Measures\n(updated)](/article/covid-19-guide-to-australia-taxation-measures-updated)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[Indiana Governor Issues Updated Stay-at-Home Order Due to Continued Spread of\nCOVID-19](/article/indiana-governor-issues-updated-stay-home-order-due-to-\ncontinued-spread-covid-19)\n\nBy\n\n[Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C.](/organization/ogletree-\ndeakins-nash-smoak-stewart-pc)\n\n[COVID-19: System Security With a Remote Workforce](/article/covid-19-system-\nsecurity-remote-workforce)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[Coronavirus and Social Distancing Related Job Loss: Child Support and\nChildcare Related Issues](/article/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-related-\njob-loss-child-support-and-childcare)\n\nBy\n\n[Anderson & Boback](/organization/anderson-boback)\n\n[A Phishing Pandemic \u2013 Part II](/article/phishing-pandemic-part-ii)\n\nBy\n\n[K&L Gates](/organization/kl-gates)\n\n[FAQ: Paycheck Protection Loans and Economic Injury Disaster\nLoans](/article/faq-paycheck-protection-loans-and-economic-injury-disaster-\nloans)\n\nBy\n\n[Ward and Smith, P.A.](/organization/ward-and-smith-pa)\n\n[Interim Rule Issued \u2013 Paycheck Protection Program](/article/interim-rule-\nissued-paycheck-protection-program)\n\nBy\n\n[Vedder Price](/organization/vedder-price-pc)\n\n[The Effects of COVID-19 on Support Orders](/article/effects-covid-19-support-\norders)\n\nBy\n\n[Varnum LLP](/organization/varnum-llp)\n\n[Underestimated Risks: M&A and German Employee\nInventions](/article/underestimated-risks-ma-and-german-employee-inventions)\n\nBy\n\n[Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP](/organization/squire-patton-boggs-us-llp)\n\n[Court Holds That A Deceased Testamentary Trust Beneficiary Can Still Be A\nBeneficiary](/article/court-holds-deceased-testamentary-trust-beneficiary-can-\nstill-be-beneficiary)\n\nBy\n\n[Winstead](/organization/winstead)\n\n[Take Caution with Filing Deadlines During COVID-19 Crisis](/article/take-\ncaution-filing-deadlines-during-covid-19-crisis)\n\nBy\n\n[Davis Kuelthau](/organization/davis-kuelthau)\n\n[The Importance of Reviewing and Complying with Performance\nBonds](/article/importance-reviewing-and-complying-performance-bonds)\n\nBy\n\n[Ward and Smith, P.A.](/organization/ward-and-smith-pa)\n\n[Too Much Time on Their Hands \u2013 New Executive Order Limits Time Period for\nTeam Telecom Reviews](/article/too-much-time-their-hands-new-executive-order-\nlimits-time-period-team-telecom)\n\nBy\n\n[Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP](/organization/sheppard-mullin-\nrichter-hampton-llp)\n\n[Judicial Council of California\u2019s Emergency Orders Affecting Employment\nActions](/article/judicial-council-california-s-emergency-orders-affecting-\nemployment-actions)\n\nBy\n\n[Jackson Lewis P.C.](/organization/jackson-lewis-pc)\n\n[Supreme Court Update: Citgo Asphalt Refining Co. v.

Millions of\npeople across the nation are cloistered inside their homes, many of them\nrelying on the company to provide basic goods. Amazon is already struggling to\nmeet demand, and some employees feel they\u2019re being unfairly endangered by\nworking in warehouses filled with other workers. It\u2019s unclear how deliveries\ncould continue if the workers who sort, pack, and ship Americans\u2019 goods start\ngetting sick in droves.\n\nThough [two office workers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/second-amazon-\nemployee-in-seattle-tests-positive-for-the-coronavirus.html) at Amazon\u2019s\nSeattle headquarters have been diagnosed with COVID-19, this is the first\nconfirmed [case](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/second-amazon-employee-in-\nseattle-tests-positive-for-the-coronavirus.html) of the disease among the\ncompany\u2019s hourly warehouse employees in the United States. These workers make\nup the majority of Amazon\u2019s 600,000-strong workforce.\n\nAccording to the text, which was sent by a member of a workers\u2019 group called\nAmazonians United, management sent day-shift workers home in order to\ndisinfect the sorting facility, known as DBK1. Jonathan Bailey, an employee\nwho sorts packages at the Queens facility, told me that workers were not\nnotified of the positive case by Amazon management; he learned of it from\nother employees. He said workers believed that they were still expected to\nreport for their night shift. In an email to _The Atlantic_ , Amazon denied\nthis, saying that it notified all associates about the positive test, and that\nworkers were not expected to come in for their night shift.\n\n[Annie Lowrey: The coronavirus recession will be unusually difficult to\nfight](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/viral-\nrecession/607657/)\n\nRena Lunak, an Amazon spokesperson, confirmed to _The Atlantic_ that there was\na positive case at the facility, but did not reveal the person\u2019s identity. \u201cWe\nare supporting the individual who is now in quarantine,\u201d she said. \u201cIn\naddition to our enhanced daily deep cleaning, we\u2019ve temporarily closed the\nQueens delivery station for additional sanitation and have sent associates\nhome with full pay.\u201d\n\nThe incident rattled some of the warehouse workers, who already feel they are\nbeing underpaid for a risky job: continuing to work in close proximity to\nothers during a dangerous pandemic. \u201cThis clearly shows a disregard for our\nhealth and safety,\u201d said Bailey, who is also a member of Amazonians United.\n\nOn March 11, Amazon\n[announced](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-\npaid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund) that all employees diagnosed with\nCOVID-19 or placed in quarantine would receive two weeks of sick pay. In\naddition, Amazon gave hourly workers unlimited unpaid time off through the end\nof March.\n\nBut some Amazon workers\u2014including those in New York City, where positive cases\nhave spiked sharply in the past 48 hours\u2014have expressed concern that these\nmeasures have been insufficient to protect them from the coronavirus. As of\nthis writing, there are 1,871 [known\ncases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-\nupdate.html) of the coronavirus in the city, and officials expect that number\nto rise dramatically. What\u2019s more, [research\nsuggests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-can-stay-\ninfectious-for-days-on-\nsurfaces/2020/03/12/9b54a99e-6472-11ea-845d-e35b0234b136_story.html) that the\nvirus can live on cardboard for 24 hours, so there\u2019s a possibility that\npackages sick employees send may be contagious.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazonians United NYC [released a\npetition](https://medium.com/@amazoniansunitednyc/we-amazon-workers-demand-\ncoronavirus-protections-16f28ad8b15f), signed by more than 1,500 workers, in\nwhich they demanded that the company provide paid sick leave to all its\nemployees, even those who do not have a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, given the\n[scarcity of coronavirus\ntests](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-testing-\nnumbers/607714/). They also requested child-care funds for workers with\nchildren, increased hazard pay, an end to penalties for working too slowly,\nand an immediate closure of any facility where a worker tests positive.\n(Amazon did not respond to a question about how long DBK1 was or will be\nclosed.)\n\n[Read: The dangerous delays in U.S. coronavirus testing haven\u2019t\nstopped](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-\ntesting-numbers/607714/)\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak will be especially challenging for Amazon, which is\nfacing a surge of orders as Americans socially distance by remaining at home,\nand as traditional brick-and-mortar shops close their doors. On Monday,\n[Amazon announced plans](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816704442/amazon-to-\nhire-100-000-workers-to-meet-surge-in-demand) to hire 100,000 more warehouse\nworkers to meet the growing demand, and the company added $2 to American\nwarehouse workers\u2019 hourly pay.\n\nWorkers in several of the company\u2019s European warehouses have contracted the\nvirus, and Amazon opted to keep those facilities open, [prompting\noutcry](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-17/amazon-coronavirus-\ndelivery) from workers. In both Spain and Italy, which have high rates of the\ncoronavirus, the [company has](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rules-\nout-shutting-down-spanish-warehouses-covid-19-19-2020-3) nevertheless kept\nfacilities open.\n\nThe outbreak sets up an uncomfortable tension for the shipping giant: between\nmaintaining worker safety and delivering packages on time. Dale Rogers, a\nprofessor of supply-chain management at Arizona State University, said that\nalthough Amazon could mitigate some warehouse-employee absences through\nautomation, if Amazon logistics employees, who drive the packages from the\ndistribution centers to homes, start getting sick en masse, \u201cthat could be\ncatastrophic.\u201d Meanwhile, [other\nexperts](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-17/amazon-coronavirus-\ndelivery) have speculated that shutting down several distribution facilities\nat once would greatly hamper Amazon\u2019s ability to make deliveries, especially\nsince customers now expect them in a couple of days or less.\n\nLate tonight, Bailey and other workers arrived at the Queens warehouse and\n[refused to work their\nshift](https://twitter.com/NYCAmazonians/status/1240509204840005632?s=20),\neffectively shutting down the facility, he said. One worker told me that she\nwished she could just stay at home with pay, like so many white-collar\nAmericans are doing now.\n\n\u201cWe should be home with our families in quarantine like most everyone else\nis,\u201d said the worker at the DBK1 warehouse, who requested anonymity because\nshe feared retaliation for speaking out. She said she was planning on staying\nhome from work tonight after hearing of the positive result. \u201cWe\u2019re putting\nour lives in danger.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Just 2 days after that, researchers at the Vaccine\nResearch Center at the NIH finalized the design of the vaccine and began to\nmanufacture it, finishing the first batch on February 7th.

Some experts are\ninsisting that the severity and urgent need of the current situation means\nthis is justified, whereas others are concerned that this could break various\nethical and safety standards and put trial participants at greater risk than\nnormal.\n\nHowever, following a request for more information, NIAID says that the vaccine\nhas undergone some testing in mice already, but the data from these\nexperiments is not yet published:\n\n\u201c _NIAID investigators have conducted preclinical immunogenicity testing of\nmRNA-1273 in mouse models. These studies show that the vaccine produces a\npotent antibody response against the COVID-19 virus. This data is not yet\npublished. However, while these studies are supportive of the Phase 1 trial,\nthey are not the basis for starting the clinical trial. The safety assessment\nis based on prior human studies of other vaccines developed using the mRNA\nplatform technology. NIAID is following FDA guidance in performing the Phase 1\nclinical trial. The studies in mice and future studies in nonhuman primates,\nin addition to the information from the Phase 1 clinical trial, will establish\nthe rationale for testing the vaccine in larger trials if warranted.\u201d - NIAID\nstatement, 18th March 2020._\n\nAlthough the design and production of the prospective vaccine was incredibly\nfast, evaluation of it will take considerable time.

As well, where possible,\nessential service crews such as Emergency Response and Pump Crews are being\nkept in isolation from the broader workforce.\n\n\"In order to ease pressure and help lighten the load on health workers in\nregional areas from people presenting for COVID-19 testing, resource companies\nare also waiving requirements for a doctor's certificate for general illness\nleave.\n\n\"As the COVID-19 situation evolves here and around the world, it will be\ncritical for our industry - like all Australians - to heed the advice from\nhealth authorities.\"\n\n\"It is also critical as an industry we continue to devote our full attention\nto implementing the processes and procedures in accordance with the latest\nadvice.\"\n\n\"While these are turbulent times amid the COVID-19 response, the resources\nindustry will continue to play its central role in the economic productivity\nof the state and lives of all Queenslanders.\n\n\"QRC will continue to work on a full range of industry issues, but we cannot\nafford distractions from what is essential at this time - responding to the\nglobal pandemic that is COVID-19.\"\n\nRead the article online at:\nhttps://www.worldcoal.com/coal/20032020/queenslands-resources-sectors-people-\nfirst-covid-19-response/\n\n## You might also like\n\n[ ![](https://d2e1tbtdbinpro.cloudfront.net/media/articles/thumb/money-01.jpg)\n](/coal/08042020/sandviks-board-of-directors-withdraws-dividend-proposal/)\n\n##  [ Sandvik\u2019s Board of Directors withdraws dividend proposal\n](/coal/08042020/sandviks-board-of-directors-withdraws-dividend-proposal/)\n\nWednesday 08 April 2020 09:39\n\nThe Board of Directors of Sandvik has decided to withdraw the previous\ndividend proposal and instead propose that the Annual General Meeting on 28\nApril resolve that no dividend will be paid.\n\n\n\n  * __Embed\n  * __Tags\n\n\n\n**Embed article link:** (copy the HTML code below):\n\n[Queensland's resources sector\u2019s \u2018people first\u2019 COVID-19\nresponse](https://www.worldcoal.com/coal/20032020/queenslands-resources-\nsectors-people-first-covid-19-response/ \"Queensland's resources sector\u2019s\n\u2018people first\u2019 COVID-19 response\")\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nThis article has been tagged under the following:\n\n[ Australia coal news  ](/tag/australia-coal-news/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00d7Close\n\nThis content is available to members only.

As some of America's biggest\nfirms are pampered with state largess to see the pandemic through, workers may\nbe largely left to fend for themselves.\n\n> I don\u2019t agree.

Tony Evers tried to delay it, and the state Supreme Court declared\nthe vote must go on, Wisconsinites went to the polls in Tuesday's spring\nelection and cast ballots carefully, deliberately and defiantly in the midst\nof the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"People died for my right to vote, so if I have to take a risk to vote that's\nwhat I have to do,\" said Michael Claus, 66, who was among several hundred\npeople waiting in an early morning line to vote at Milwaukee's Riverside\nUniversity High School.\n\nAcross the state, in schools, churches and town halls, poll workers risked\ntheir health to make sure democracy worked. Members of the National Guard also\npitched in.\n\nIn Milwaukee, where only five polling sites were open, the workers donned face\nmasks and rubber gloves, handed out black pens to voters, wiped surfaces clean\nand kept the lines moving as best they could even as the state remained under\na safer-at-home order.\n\nHand sanitizer was a must.\n\nAnd votes won't be counted until Monday, another twist in the latest chapter\nin this only-in-Wisconsin political story.\n\nThe main contests: the state Supreme Court race between Justice Daniel Kelly\nand Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky, and the Democratic presidential\nprimary.\n\nJames Grow, 33, of Milwaukee, who wore a painter's face mask for protection,\nwaited outside Riverside High to vote and said: \"I don't feel that I'm risking\nmy life, but it's definitely different. Everyone is properly practicing social\ndistancing.\"\n\nOutside Milwaukee's Washington High School, where she waited in a line for two\nhours, Jennifer Taff held up a sign: \"This is ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I'm disgusted. I requested an absentee ballot almost three weeks ago and\nnever got it. I have a father dying from lung disease and I have to risk my\nlife and his just to exercise my right to vote,\" she said.\n\nThere were long lines in Milwaukee and shorter lines elsewhere, as well as a\npalpable sense of frustration.\n\n\"We have moved forward with an election, but we have not moved forward with\ndemocracy in the state of Wisconsin,\" said Neil Albrecht, executive director\nof the Milwaukee Election Commission.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in during his daily briefing Tuesday and\naccused Wisconsin Democrats of wanting to move the election only after he\nendorsed Daniel Kelly for Supreme Court.\n\n\"As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats said let\u2019s move the\nelection,\u201d Trump said.\n\n[Trump first endorsed Kelly during a January appearance in Milwaukee and it\nwas months later before Democrats pushed for the election to be\nmoved.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/15/trump-and-\nscott-walker-loom-wisconsins-race-supreme-court/4467748002/)\n\nAsked about reports of long lines to vote in Wisconsin and about voters who\nmay get sick due to a lack of social distancing, Trump put the focus on Evers.\n\n\"Ask him, that\u2019s his problem. He should be doing it. Again, some governors\nfail, and I won\u2019t let them fail because when they fail, I\u2019ll help, but that\u2019s\nrun by Democrats right now,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cNow I understand there are lines that go back a long way, I hope they\u2019re\ngoing to vote for Justice Kelly,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a statement, Evers said: \u201cI listened when the president talked about the\nserious and tragic reality of this virus, and he said there will be a lot of\ndeath in the coming weeks. I don\u2019t pay any attention to who the president\nendorses and I don\u2019t make endorsements in nonpartisan elections.\n\n\"Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and\nthat\u2019s why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsin\u2019s election date and\nmake sure everyone could vote safely from home.\"\n\nClerks this year faced a task they've never had before: sending 1.3 million\nballots by mail, finding workers willing to risk their health on election day,\nand keeping everyone safe from a deadly virus.\n\nBut because of that crush of requests to vote by mail, many Wisconsin voters\nwere still waiting to receive their ballot on election day, including\nMilwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, who ended up voting in person at South\nDivision High School.\n\n[](/picture-gallery/news/2020/04/07/coronavirus-wisconsin-scenes-election-day-\napril-7/2962085001/)\n\nAt least 50 people have contacted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in recent\ndays reporting issues getting their ballots by mail as clerks became\noverwhelmed with requests. Some say clerks don't even have a record of voters'\nballot requests.\n\nWith last-minute rules changes, voters had to weigh going to the polls.\n\nDale Stoeber lives alone in Kenosha and is 71 \u2014 too old to vote in person and\nnot risk developing life-threatening complications if he catches the virus.\nBut that\u2019s what he had to do after not being able to get a witness\u2019 signature\non the ballot.\n\n\"I have no choice but to vote in person, with much apprehension,\" he told the\nJournal Sentinel. \"Lord help the state if it is proven down the line that this\nvirus spreads more widely.\"\n\nJason Pelsis, 40, said he requested a ballot online March 19 and didn't\nrealize he hadn't received it until Friday.\n\nWhen he called the Wauwatosa Clerk's Office, he was told his request had been\nlost. Pelsis said he tried to show the clerk his web browser history as proof,\nbut it wasn't accepted, he said.\n\n\"I would say I have it better than most people. But I don\u2019t have time to think\nto go back to a state website for the heck of it to monitor the status of\nsomething I thought was completed,\" Pelsis said.\n\nIn the Village of Palmyra, where a key school board race was on the ballot,\nthere was a different vibe than usual at the polls, said Clerk/Treasurer\nLaurie Mueller.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of visiting and chit-chatting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much\ncome in and do your business and move on, which is good. We don\u2019t want people\nhanging out.\u201d\n\nThe City of Brookfield set up a single polling place in the 18,000-square-foot\nballroom at Brookfield Conference Center. Social distancing was enforced with\ntape placed in 6-foot increments on the ground.\n\n\"It\u2019s going about as well as can be expected for this crazy, crazy election,\u201d\nBrookfield Clerk Kelly Michaels said.\n\nIn Ozaukee County, several polling places reported steady, if slightly lighter\nturnout. About half the voters were observed wearing masks at a half dozen\npolling places.\n\nThe City of Mequon stationed a pair of public works employees at the entrances\nto every one of the city's eight polling sites, just to remind voters to space\nout and limit entry if the sites got crowded.\n\nAt Lumen Christi Catholic Church, police auxiliary officers were checking in\nand said they would be visiting all the sites all day.\n\nLance Awsumb donned a mask before he entered to vote. Afterward, he said he\nhad been watching the news most of Monday to find out if the election would be\non or off, but finally gave up.\n\n\"I just checked this morning. When I saw it was on, I came out,\" he said. He\nsaid he didn't really have a strong feeling either way on whether the election\nshould have been postponed or held entirely by mail.\n\nOutside the Cedarburg Community Center, the city's sole polling spot, Mayor\nMike O'Keefe was helping answer voter questions as some stood in a spaced-out\nline waiting to enter.\n\nHe and chief election official Donna Steffens agreed the lines had been longer\nduring early voting at next-door City Hall over the prior two weeks.\n\nPoll workers in Madison wore face masks, face shields and rubber gloves as\nthey directed people to voting booths and kept them 6 feet apart from each\nother in line.\n\nAt the Hawthorne Library, Ben Shinners said he thought about staying away from\nthe polls for safety reasons but decided to vote because he wants to see\nchange. He said Gov. Tony Evers and other officials should have done more\nsooner to try to delay the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that our governor didn\u2019t see earlier that he should have\ncanceled this. I\u2019m also disappointed that the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not\n\u2026 put people first,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe in our political\nsystem right now just because I really feel, especially in Wisconsin, it\u2019s all\njust partisan stuff. And I don\u2019t think the voters are really taken into\naccount at all.\u201d\n\nWilliam Gilomen wore a red bandanna around his face and timed his visit to the\nlibrary in the afternoon to avoid the morning and evening rushes. He said he\nbelieved the city took precautions that kept voters safe.\n\n\u201cI think it went fine,\u201d he said as he rubbed his hands with sanitizer. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t feel any threats or danger myself. It went very smooth. I think it took\nabout three minutes.\u201d\n\nAt Green Bay West High School, Terry Sipes was one of the early arrivals.

This will also apply to\ntaxpayers under Direct Deposit Installment Agreements, but it is currently\nunclear how taxpayers can contact the IRS to ask the agency to suspend those\nwithdrawals. The IRS will not default any installment agreements during the\nperiod from April 1, 2020 to July 15, 2020. Taxpayers that are eligible for\nstreamlined installment agreements can still enter into those agreements\nthrough the _[IRS website here](https://www.irs.gov/payments/online-payment-\nagreement-application)_.\n\nTaxpayers with pending offers in compromise (OIC) are allowed to provide\nrequested additional information to support the OIC until July 15, 2020. The\nIRS will not close any pending OIC requests before July 15, 2020 without the\ntaxpayer's consent. Taxpayers have the option to suspend all payments on\naccepted OICs until July 15, 2020. The IRS will not default an OIC for\ntaxpayers who have not filed their 2018 or 2019 tax returns before July 15,\n2020. However, taxpayers should be aware that they will need to file their\n2018 tax return and their 2019 tax return, if not under extension, to prevent\nthe IRS from defaulting their OIC after July 15, 2020. Taxpayers who qualify\nfor the OIC program are encouraged to continue filing their OICs.\n\n### Systemic Liens and Levies\n\nThe IRS is suspending all new automatic, systemic liens and levies until July\n15. These notices are typically computer-generated a few days or weeks in\nadvance, so taxpayers may still receive notices over the next few weeks.\nTaxpayers should not ignore the notices and should continue to respond with\ntimely requests for collection due process hearings when appropriate. As of\nMonday, March 23, 2020, the IRS is not available through its call centers, so\ntaxpayers need to send their responses in writing by USPS certified mail for\nproof of mailing. There is no indication as to when the call centers will be\nreopened.\n\nThe IRS is also suspending liens and levies (including any seizure of personal\nresidence) initiated by field revenue officers during this period. However,\nthe IRS emphasized that field revenue officers will continue to pursue high-\nincome non-filers and perform other similar activities where warranted. The\nnotice reports that over 1 million households have not filed a tax return\nduring the last three years and are actually owed a refund. Taxpayers still\nhave time to file their individual returns and claim a refund for the 2016,\n2017, 2018, and 2019 tax years.\n\n### New Passport Certifications Suspended\n\nThe IRS is suspending new passport certifications to the State Department for\ntaxpayers who have \"seriously delinquent tax debt.\" This generally applies to\ntaxpayers who owe more than $53,000 in tax, interest and penalties who do not\nqualify for one of several exceptions, including taxpayers under an existing\ninstallment agreement or those who file for an OIC. Certification to the State\nDepartment prevents taxpayers from receiving or renewing passports. The IRS\ndoes not give guidance for individuals with previously certified tax debts\nthat come into compliance before July 15. However, the IRS is supposed to\nreverse the certification with 30 days of compliance and provide the State\nDepartment with notification \"as soon as practicable.\"\n\nThe IRS will not forward any new delinquent accounts to private collection\nagencies. There is no guidance addressing taxpayers whose debts are already\nbeing worked by those agencies.\n\nThe notice makes clear that the exam and appeals functions of the IRS are\nstill working during this period. The IRS is generally not starting any new\nfield, office or correspondence examinations, but it will continue to start\nnew examinations and work examination when the IRS deems them necessary to\nprotect the applicable statute of limitations. Taxpayers should not ignore\nnotices from the examination division and should make every effort to respond\nto the IRS examination notice, even if to explain that the taxpayer is not\ncurrently able to fully comply with the IRS' request. The IRS is suspending\nin-person meetings, but staff will continue to conduct examinations remotely,\nwhere possible. The Office of Appeals continues to work its cases and will\ncontinue to hold appeals conferences with taxpayers by telephone or video\nconference.\n\n[[View source](https://www.foxrothschild.com/publications/irs-people-first-\ninitiative-changes-collections-procedures/).]\n\n[__Send](javascript:sendit\\(\\);) [__Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n[__Report](/reportaproblem/index.aspx)\n\n### Latest Posts\n\n  * [IRS Issues Guidance On Tax Credits For Required Paid Leave Under FFCRA](/legalnews/irs-issues-guidance-on-tax-credits-for-59009/)\n  * [CARES Act Provides Immediate Relief From Payments On Certain Existing SBA Loans](/legalnews/cares-act-provides-immediate-relief-76486/)\n  * [NJ Supreme Court Recognizes Medical Marijuana Discrimination](/legalnews/nj-supreme-court-recognizes-medical-11092/)\n  * [NLRB Finalizes Further Changes To Union Election Procedures](/legalnews/nlrb-finalizes-further-changes-to-union-78794/)\n  * [New York State Enacts Paid Sick Leave Requirements](/legalnews/new-york-state-enacts-paid-sick-leave-43604/)\n\n[See more \u00bb](/profile/Fox_Rothschild_docs/)\n\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided\nherein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon\nwithout specific legal advice based on particular situations.\n\n(C) Fox Rothschild LLP  | Attorney Advertising\n\n__\n\n[Refine your interests \u00bb](/follow/manageyourinterests//)\n\n####  Written by:\n\n[![Fox Rothschild\nLLP](//www.jdsupra.com/showThumbnail.aspx?img=15673_77.jpg&size=sm)](/profile/Fox_Rothschild_docs/)\n\n[Fox Rothschild LLP](/profile/Fox_Rothschild_docs/)\n\n[Contact](/profile/contributor-contact.aspx) \\+ Follow x Following x Following\n\\- Unfollow\n\n[![Brian Gardner](https://jdsupra-\nstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/authors/5e80de63712b7.30h.jpg)](/authors/brian-\ngardner2/)\n\n[Brian Gardner](/authors/brian-gardner2/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\nmore __\n\nless __\n\n#### Published In:\n\n[Coronavirus/COVID-19](/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[IRS](/topics/irs/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[Relief Measures](/topics/relief-measures/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[State of Emergency](/topics/state-of-emergency/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[Time Extensions](/topics/time-extensions/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[Finance & Banking](https://www.jdsupra.com/law-news/finance-banking-law/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\n[Tax](https://www.jdsupra.com/law-news/tax-law/)\n\n\\+ Follow x Following x Following \\- Unfollow\n\nmore __\n\nless __\n\n#### Fox Rothschild LLP on:\n\n[![](/img/social-\nicons/linkedin-32x32.png)](http://www.linkedin.com/company/fox-rothschild-llp)\n\n[![](/img/social-icons/facebook-32x32.png)](http://facebook.com/foxrothschild)\n\n[![](/img/social-icons/twitter-32x32.gif)](http://twitter.com/FoxRothschild)\n\n[![](/img/social-icons/website-32x32.gif)](http://www.foxrothschild.com/)\n\n[![](/img/social-icons/supra-32x32.gif)](/profile/Fox_Rothschild_rss)\n\n[![Readers' Choice 2017](/img/readerschoice/2017-winners/promo-\nwinners.jpg)](/readerschoice/2017/)\n\n[![Reporters on Deadline](/img/ad-for-journalists.png)](/perspective/media-\nquery.aspx)\n\n__\n\n# \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email\u2026\"\n\nYour first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering\npertinent authors and topics on JD Supra:\n\n[Sign Up](/follow/subscribe-form.aspx) [Log in](/login.aspx)\n\n_* By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy\nPolicy._\n\n[![Custom Email Digest](/img/digest-screenshot.jpg)](/linkedinlogin/)\n\n\\- hide\n\n# JD Supra Privacy Policy\n\nUpdated: May 25, 2018:\n\nJD Supra is a legal publishing service that connects experts and their content\nwith broader audiences of professionals, journalists and associations.\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes how JD Supra, LLC (\"JD Supra\" or \"we,\" \"us,\" or\n\"our\") collects, uses and shares personal data collected from visitors to our\nwebsite (located at [www.jdsupra.com](/)) (our \"Website\") who view only\npublicly-available content as well as subscribers to our services (such as our\nemail digests or author tools)(our \"Services\").

co-founder and chief financial officer of Jersey City-\nbased PeopleFirst, recently completed an update for his mobile phone\napplication to help company managers resolve workplace harassment incidents\nand protect their employees.\n\nThrough his [pilot version of the software](https://njbiz.com/human-resources-\nhotline/), Nazareth learned that companies also wanted a solution to protect\nemployees from discrimination and bullying. As a result, he expanded the\nworkflow of PeopleFirst to include these categories. Now employees can report\non all the obstacles that impede their work well-being, and management has a\nmore complete view of what is happening in their organization.\n\n![Niren Nazareth, co\u2011founder and CFO, PeopleFirst, software for reporting\nworkplace harassment. - AARON HOUSTON](https://njbiz.com/files/2019/12/Niren-\nNazareth_AH_03-1024x683.jpg)\n\nNiren Nazareth, co\u2011founder and CFO, PeopleFirst, software for reporting\nworkplace harassment. - AARON HOUSTON - AARON HOUSTON\n\n\u201cThe timing of our new features release has coincided with a surge in remote\nwork, a response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Nazareth said. \u201cEven before the\npush for social distancing, remote work in the U.S. had increased by 91\npercent over the past 10 years bringing previously face-to-face interactions\nonline. Companies are still trying to adjust their legacy reporting systems to\naccommodate remote workers that may not come into the office for long periods\nof time. We\u2019ve recently heard of cases where the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled\nan increase in xenophobia and racial harassment, which can manifest itself in\nperson or online.\u201d\n\nNazareth said it was very important for PeopleFirst to expand its offering to\ninclude discrimination and bullying. \"Because both discrimination and\nharassment can be illegal if based on a characteristic or status protected\nunder anti-discrimination laws, we needed to expand our coverage to fully\nprotect employees and employers,\u201d he said.\n\nNazareth said the company has spent a lot of time listening to its customers\nwho relay their \u201cpain points\u201d that often contribute to workplace misconduct.\n\n\"We then try to build features that address these problems and increase the\nvalue they get from People First.\"\n\n12:51 pm Tue, March 31, 2020 [NJBIZ](https://njbiz.com)\n\n**[David Hutter](https://njbiz.com/author/david_hutter/ \"Posts by David\nHutter\")**\n\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://njbiz.com/peoplefirst-updates-app-new-solutions-work-remotely/&text=PeopleFirst updates app with new solutions as more work remotely \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://njbiz.com/peoplefirst-updates-app-new-solutions-work-remotely/ \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://njbiz.com/peoplefirst-updates-app-new-solutions-work-remotely/ \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Email (Opens in new window)](mailto:?subject=PeopleFirst updates app with new solutions as more work remotely&body=https://njbiz.com/peoplefirst-updates-app-new-solutions-work-remotely/ \"Click to share on Email\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](javascript:void\\(\\) \"Click to print\")\n\n###\n\n![](https://njbiz.com/files/2019/01/persbilde1-4-1.png)\n\nDavid Hutter\n\n[__follow david_njbiz](http://twitter.com/david_njbiz \"David Hutter  on\nTwitter\")\n\nDavid Hutter grew up in Darien, Conn., and covers higher education,\ntransportation and manufacturing for NJBIZ.

During this difficult time, we\nwant people working together, focused on their well-being, helping each other\nand others less fortunate.\"\n\n\"The new IRS People First Initiative provides immediate relief to help people\nfacing uncertainty over taxes,\" Rettig added. \"We are temporarily adjusting\nour processes to help people and businesses during these uncertain times. We\nare facing this together, and we want to be part of the solution to improve\nthe lives of all people in our country.\"\n\nSign Up for Belmar/Lake Como Newsletter\n\nOur newsletter delivers the local news that you can trust.\n\nYou have successfully signed up for the TAPinto Belmar/Lake Como Newsletter.\n\nThese new changes include issues ranging from postponing certain payments\nrelated to installment agreements and offers in compromise to collection and\nlimiting certain enforcement actions. The IRS will be temporarily modifying\nthe following activities as soon as possible; the projected start date will be\nApril 1 and the effort will initially run through July 15.\n\nDuring this period, to the maximum extent possible, the IRS will avoid in-\nperson contacts. However, the IRS will continue to take steps where necessary\nto protect all applicable statutes of limitations.\n\nMore specifics about the implementation of these provisions will be shared\nsoon. Highlights of the key actions in the IRS People First Initiative\ninclude:\n\n**Existing Installment Agreements** - For taxpayers under an existing\ninstallment agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are\nsuspended. Taxpayers who are currently unable to comply with the terms of an\ninstallment payment agreement, including a direct deposit installment\nagreement, may suspend payments during this period if they prefer.\nFurthermore, the IRS will not default any installment agreements during this\nperiod. By law, interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n\n**New Installment Agreements** - The IRS reminds people unable to fully pay\ntheir federal taxes that they can resolve outstanding liabilities by entering\ninto a monthly payment agreement with the IRS. See [IRS.gov](http://IRS.gov)\nfor further information.  \n  \n\n**Offers in Compromise (OIC)** - The IRS is taking several steps to assist\ntaxpayers in various stages of the OIC process:\n\n  * **Pending OIC applications** - The IRS will allow taxpayers until July 15 to provide requested additional information to support a pending OIC. In addition, the IRS will not close any pending OIC request before July 15, without the taxpayer's consent.\n  * **OIC Payments** - Taxpayers have the option of suspending all payments on accepted OICs until July 15,  although by law interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.\n  * **Delinquent Return Filings** - The IRS will not default an OIC for those taxpayers who are delinquent in filing their tax return for tax year 2018. However, taxpayers should file any delinquent 2018 return (and their 2019 return) on or before July 15.\n  * **New OIC Applications** - The IRS reminds people facing a liability exceeding their net worth that the OIC process is designed to resolve outstanding tax liabilities by providing a \"Fresh Start.\" Further information is available at [IRS.gov](http://IRS.gov).\n\n**Non-Filers  **- The IRS reminds people who have not filed their return for\ntax years before 2019 that they should file their delinquent returns. More\nthan 1 million households that haven't filed tax returns during the last three\nyears are actually owed refunds; they still have time to claim these refunds.\nMany should consider contacting a tax professional to consider various\navailable options since the time to receive such refunds is limited by\nstatute. Once delinquent returns have been filed, taxpayers with a tax\nliability should consider taking the opportunity to resolve any outstanding\nliabilities by entering into an installment agreement or an offer in\ncompromise with the IRS to obtain a \"Fresh Start.\" See IRS.gov for further\ninformation.\n\n**Field Collection Activities** - Liens and levies (including any seizures of\na personal residence) initiated by field revenue officers will be suspended\nduring this period. However, field revenue officers will continue to pursue\nhigh-income non-filers and perform other similar activities where warranted.\n\n**Automated Liens and Levies** - New automatic, systemic liens and levies will\nbe suspended during this period.\n\n**Passport Certifications to the State** **Department** - The IRS will suspend\nnew certifications to the Department of State for taxpayers who are \"seriously\ndelinquent\" during this period. These taxpayers are encouraged to submit a\nrequest for an Installment Agreement or, if applicable, an OIC during this\nperiod. Certification prevents taxpayers from receiving or renewing passports.\n\n**Private Debt Collection** - New delinquent accounts will not be forwarded by\nthe IRS to private collection agencies to work during this period.\n\n**Field, Office and Correspondence Audits** - During this period, the IRS will\ngenerally not start new field, office and correspondence examinations. We will\ncontinue to work refund claims where possible, without in-person contact.\nHowever, the IRS may start new examinations where deemed necessary to protect\nthe government's interest in preserving the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n  * **In-Person Meetings** - In-person meetings regarding current field, office and correspondence examinations will be suspended. Even though IRS examiners will not hold in-person meetings, they will continue their examinations remotely, where possible. To facilitate the progress of open examinations, taxpayers are encouraged to respond to any requests for information they already have received - or may receive - on all examination activity during this period if they are able to do so.\n  * **Unique Situations** - Particularly for some corporate and business taxpayers, the IRS understands that there may be instances where the taxpayers desire to begin an examination while people and records are available and respective staffs have capacity. In those instances when it's in the best interest of both parties and appropriate personnel are available, the IRS may initiate activities to move forward with an examination -- understanding that COVID-19 developments could later reduce activities for an agreed period.\n  * **General Requests for Information** - In addition to compliance activities and examinations, the IRS encourages taxpayers to respond to any other IRS correspondence requesting additional information during this time if possible.  \n\n**Earned Income Tax Credit and Wage Verification Reviews** - Taxpayers have\nuntil July 15 to respond to the IRS to verify that they qualify for the Earned\nIncome Tax Credit or to verify their income. These taxpayers are encouraged to\nexercise their best efforts to obtain and submit all requested information,\nand if unable to do so, please reach out to the IRS indicating the reason such\ninformation is not available. Until July 15,  the IRS will not deny these\ncredits for a failure to provide requested information.\n\n**Independent Office of Appeals** - Appeals employees will continue to work\ntheir cases. Although Appeals is not currently holding in-person conferences\nwith taxpayers, conferences may be held over the telephone or by\nvideoconference. Taxpayers are encouraged to promptly respond to any\noutstanding requests for information for all cases in the Independent Office\nof Appeals.\n\n**Statute of Limitations** - The IRS will continue to take steps where\nnecessary to protect all applicable statutes of limitations. In instances\nwhere statute expirations might be jeopardized during this period, taxpayers\nare encouraged to cooperate in extending such statutes. Otherwise, the IRS\nwill issue Notices of Deficiency and pursue other similar actions to protect\nthe interests of the government in preserving such statutes. Where a statutory\nperiod is not set to expire during 2020, the IRS is unlikely to pursue the\nforegoing actions until at least July 15.\n\n**Practitioner Priority Service** - Practitioners are reminded that, depending\non staffing levels and allocations going forward, there may be more\nsignificant wait times for the PPS. The IRS will continue to monitor this as\nsituations develop.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In\n\n[EVENTS](/towns/belmar-slash-lake-como/events)\n\nWed, April 08, 8:00 am  Saturday, April 11 for Health Care Workers and First-\nResponders  [Coronavirus Testing Site at PNC Bank Arts Center](/towns/belmar-\nslash-lake-como/events/coronavirus-testing-site-at-pnc-bank-arts-center)\n\n[CORONAVIRUS NEWS](/towns/belmar-slash-lake-como/sections/coronavirus-\nnews/articles)\n\n[![Carousel image 3456186cb8ea666bdcf2 coronavirusdashboard4 7 20\nli](https://tapinto-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/co/carousel_image_3456186cb8ea666bdcf2_coronavirusdashboard4-7-20_LI.jpg)](/towns/belmar-\nslash-lake-como/articles/gov-murphy-orders-county-state-parks-closed-as-\ncoronavirus-cases-rise-to-44-416)\n\n[Gov.

Archaeologists think they were\npainted in the Pleistocene epoch, dubbed the \u201cIce Age\u201d, before the Holocene\nbegan.\n\n\u201cIt was thrilling to rediscover this suite of hand stencils \u2013 perhaps the most\ninteresting rock art motifs to study,\u201d says the report\u2019s lead author\nChristopher Standish, from the University of Southampton, UK.\n\n\u201cThe stencils provide a tangible link to the people who created them; you\u2019re\nlooking at the outline of a real person\u2019s hand who lived thousands of years\nago.\u201d\n\nProduced on a mineral crust that has flaked away, the faded patterns are in\npoor condition and almost imperceptible to the untrained eye. Standish\u2019s team\nwas able to identify the hand motifs, however, along with more pigment\nsplatters that were too fragmented to ascertain as stencils.\n\nClose-up photography revealed that the outlines were produced by blowing a red\npigment over a hand placed on the cave\u2019s surface.\n\nThe archaeologists think the stencils have Pleistocene provenance due to tell-\ntale differences with known Holocene art in the cave, which includes geometric\nshapes and animals.\n\n![](https://cosmos-\nmagazine.imgix.net/file/spina/photo/21567/200331_radar_image.jpg?fit=clip&w=835)\n\nThe upper image is an original photo of some of the stencils. Below it is the\nsame photo after special digital enhancement.  \n\nCD Standish et al 2020, (copyright Elsevier 2020)\n\nThe main differences are that the hand outlines were found in a different part\nof the cave, indicating separate artistic traditions. One stencil appears to\nbe underneath a fresher sun pattern from the Holocene, suggesting it\u2019s much\nolder.\n\nFurthermore, all of the stencils were far more weathered and deteriorated than\nneighbouring Holocene patterns, suggesting a greater antiquity.  \n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the archaeological evidence from the site which has\ndemonstrated that humans were occupying the cave in the Pleistocene as early\nas 43,000 years ago,\u201d says Standish.\n\nWhat's more, the hand outlines fit a wider stencilling art tradition present\non other nearby islands and Australia.  \n\nSo what has this got to do with the first people of Australia in the\nPleistocene?\n\nResearchers had previously considered two main island-hopping routes \u2013 one\nnorthern and one southern \u2013 that humans could have taken through south-east\nAsia to reach Australia during the Ice Age around 65,000 years ago.\n\nBack then, sea levels were much lower, and Australia was part of a landmass\ncalled Sahul that also comprised Tasmania and New Guinea.\n\nThe northern route, beginning from Indonesia\u2019s Sulawesi, has more credence\nbecause it was likely to be easier. Timor-Leste could have been one of the\nlast island stops on a southern voyage but navigation and dense island\nvegetation on this route would have posed much more difficulty.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, all known Pleistocene rock paintings in southeast Asia were found\non the proposed northern dispersal route, possibly reflecting the path that\nhumans took. No Pleistocene art had ever been found on the southern route,\nuntil now.\n\n\u201cThe rock art we uncovered could be critical for understanding the\ncolonisation and spread of ideas between Asia and Sahul,\u201d says Standish. \u201cThe\nassumption that all known or presumed Pleistocene rock art falls on the\nnorthern route is likely to be incorrect.\u201d\n\nHowever, scientifically dating the hand stencils to accurately know when they\nwere made is problematic, because the red pigments used were mineral-based,\nwhich rules out carbon dating. Meanwhile, carbonate minerals haven\u2019t formed on\nthe stencils, which other isotope dating techniques require.\n\n\u201cThere are other known art sites in Timor-Leste that may provide datable\nsamples to help understand this,\u201d explains Standish. \u201cThere are also likely to\nbe other sites where poorly preserved [Pleistocene] art is present but not\ncurrently recognised.\u201d  \n\n\u201cIt is perfectly plausible that _Homo sapiens_ did first disperse and paint\nrock art along the northern dispersal route, and we aren\u2019t arguing against\nthis,\u201d Standish adds. \u201cBut art on other routes shouldn\u2019t be overlooked and\nattempts to date it are needed if we are to get a full picture of art\u2019s\nemergence in this region.\u201d\n\nExplore [#Art](/tags/art) [#human migration](/tags/human-migration)\n\nShare to Send to Toggle Dropdown\n\nFacebook Twitter Reddit Email link Print article\n\n_[James Urquhart](/contributors/james-urquhart) is a science journalist based\nin Edinburgh, Scotland_\n\n[ Looking for more science?  \nClick here to see our subscription options.

Tom Wolf, who was pulled into the conversation\nthis week.\n\n\"It's our understanding that the physical condition of the facility would\nrequire significant efforts to allow it to be used as a clinical setting\nduring a surge,\" Wolf spokesperson Lyndsay Kensinger told Billy Penn.\n\nOnce home to 496 hospital beds, the tower at Broad and Race streets has been\nsitting vacant since September of last year. Philly Mayor Jim Kenney's\nadministration says it would require considerable work to make it usable for\npatients again.\n\nAfter the city cut off negotiations to rent the building from Freedman,\n[saying the landlord was trying to \"maximize his\nprofits,\"](https://whyy.org/articles/hahnemann-buildings-owner-stymies-citys-\nbid-to-lease-it-for-covid-19-cases/) Gym sparked calls to use eminent domain\nto take the building. Eminent domain is a tool that governments use to seize\nprivate property for a public project -- while paying the owner fair market\nvalue.\n\nKenney dismissed the idea.\n\n\"It is a lengthy and complicated process under state law and we also don't\nhave that sort of time,\" Kenney said last week. \"We don't have the need to own\nit, nor the resources to buy it.\"\n\nSome groups are still clinging to the concept.\n\nPut People First! PA, a grassroots human rights organization, staged a protest\non Thursday outside the former hospital. \"We believe that the city should\nseize the Hahnemann building by emergency order,\" said Clarissa O'Connor, a\nlocal medical student with the group.\n\nIt might sound dramatic, but that move is backed up, at least partially, by\nPennsylvania eminent domain law.\n\nAccording to [commonwealth\nstatute](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=26&div=0&chpt=3&sctn=7&subsctn=0),\nif the city were to condemn the property, officials could access the facility\nrelatively quickly and let the courts work out the price later.\n\nCouncilmember Gym, known for her progressive politics, said that's worth\nlooking into.\n\n\"As we review all available options, the city has an opportunity to reclaim\nHahnemann Hospital as a key public asset during a major public emergency.\" Gym\nsaid in a statement emailed Thursday. \"We are the largest city in the country\nwithout a public hospital.\"\n\n[![hahnemannprotests-april2020-markhenninger10](https://billypenn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/hahnemannprotests-\napril2020-markhenninger10-1024x768.jpg)](https://billypenn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/hahnemannprotests-april2020-markhenninger10.jpg)\n\nMark Henninger / Imagic Digital\n\n# Activists: Let the state handle the court battle\n\nThe Kenney administration remains adamant it doesn't have time or resources to\ndeal with a court battle.\n\n\"The mayor and Managing Director [Brian Abernathy] are solely focused on\nmitigating the spread of the virus, and in expanding Philadelphia's response\ncapacity to a potential surge in cases,\" said city spokesperson Mike Dunn.\n\nInstead, the city turned to Temple, which donated use of the Liacouras Center.\nThe sports and concert arena has been outfitted with 250 beds.\n\nIf the city can't handle the logistics of a court battle over Hahnemann, could\nthe commonwealth? That's the suggestion of the Philly Socialists, a left-wing\npolitical group.\n\n\"We believe that Governor Wolf and the state government should step in to\nseize the property, a power that they hold after declaring a disaster\nemergency last month,\" activist Kaitlin Buck said. \"The commonwealth has more\nresources than the city to deal with any potential legal challenges mounted by\nJoel Freedman.\"\n\nWolf's emergency declaration, [made on Mar.\n6](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-signs-covid-19-disaster-\ndeclaration-to-provide-increased-support-for-state-response/), gives the\ngovernor authority to \"commandeer or utilize any private, public or quasi-\npublic property if necessary to cope with the disaster emergency.\"\n\nHis administration didn't rule it out. A health department spokesperson told\nWHYY last week [that all options remain on the\ntable](https://khn.org/news/coronavirus-pandemic-stricken-cities-abandoned-\nhospitals-conversion-reopening/), though Wolf's spokesperson indicated to\nBilly Penn it's not on the front burner due to Hahnemann's deteriorating\nphysical condition.\n\n\"Right now, we are doing everything we can to increase our healthcare\ncapacity,\" spokesperson Kensinger said. \"That is why the mitigation efforts\nbeing taken by the administration are so important. We need people to stay\ncalm, stay home, and stay safe.\"\n\nWant some more?

of the Official Opposition Ryan Meili has called for a united front in\nthe continued battle against COVID-19.\n\nMeili said during a press conference Tuesday he wants to implement a special\ncommittee to meet the needs of \u201cissues that are not being addressed.\u201d\n\n__\n\narticle continues below\n\n__\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * Nearly 400 calls to Saskatchewan phone

received lots of support as they challenged to be on the cover of Inked Magazine\n\n\u201cIt is a moment to put partisan politics aside and put people first,\u201d said\nMeili.\n\nMeili said so far, he has received \u201cradio silence\u201d when it comes to a response\nfrom Premier Scott Moe. He added although he did bring up this same call\nduring the short-lived legislature sitting, he has given them time to respond\nand hopes sending the message again will get the attention of Moe and company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a different moment now. We think this is the road to go down,\u201d said\nMeili.\n\nMeili said in a letter sent to the premier the proposed committee should\ninclude members from the government and official opposition caucuses, along\nwith leaders all over the province such as First Nations and metis leaders,\nmunicipal leaders, and leaders in key sectors such as health, education,\nsocial services and justice.\n\n\u201cSaskatchewan people are asking their leaders to put aside their differences\nand working together to respond to this unprecedent challenge,\u201d said Meili in\nthe letter.\n\n\u201cMy team and I are ready and eager to work collaboratively to build the best\npublic health and economic response possible for the people of our province,\u201d\nhe added.\n\nTo date, Saskatchewan has 260 confirmed cases of COVID-19 of which 169 are\nactive.\n\nSeven more people have recovered bringing the provincial total to 88.\nAdditionally, seven people are hospitalized with two being treated in ICU.\n\nThirteen of the cases are people 19 years of age and under and 112 cases are\nin the 20-44 age range. Ninety-two are in the 45-64 age range and 43 are in\nthe 65-plus age range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright  Estevan Mercury\n\n###  Comments\n\n####  NOTE: To post a comment you must have an account with at least one of\nthe following services: Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ You may then login\nusing your account credentials for that service.

Similarly, State Campaign Organisations,\nacross the country, domesticated the slogan to suit their own peculiarities.\nIn Kaduna, change meant \u2018\u2019Making the State Great Again\u2019\u2019 and that catch-phrase\nrekindled hope, galvanised the electorate and fired up their potentials. Yet\nagain, Governor Nasir Ahmad El Rufai, upon assuming office, abridged this\nmessage to a more precise and picturesque one. Right now, \u2018\u2019Putting people\nfirst\u2019\u2019 is the new signature tune and the defining attribute of his\nadministration. So, whether in rejuvenating the civil service, overhauling the\neducation or health sectors, the people are always the focus of El Rufai\u2019s\npolicies. Likewise, the infrastructural upgrade, human capacity development\nand mentoring of new leaders, are all people-centred in concept and\ndelivery.**\n\nConsistently, the capital expenditures have been receiving the lion share of\nthe annual budget in the last four years. Similarly, the education and health\nsectors got a huge chunk of the budget estimates, in line with \u2018\u2019Putting\nPeople first.\u2019\u2019 Significantly, on November 29, 2015, after six months in\noffice, El Rufai had presented a draft of the 2016 budget to a Town Hall\nmeeting. The aim, according to him, was to scrutinise the proposal and\naccommodate people\u2019s input. In all, the size of the budget was N166 billion,\nwhere N104 billion was earmarked for capital expenditure and N62 billion was\nfor recurrent spending. Thereafter, the estimate was passed to the legislature\nin December and by January, the budget had been signed into law by the\ngovernor.\n\nIn 2016, after one year in office, El Rufai improved on his record but\nessentially, the 2017 budget retained the same pro-poor programmes of the\npreceding fiscal year. On October 12, 2016, he had submitted an appropriation\nbill, christened \u2018\u2019Budget of Jobs, Social Justice and Equity\u2019\u2019, to the House\nof Assembly. The legislature, two months later, had passed the budget of N214\nbillion and on December 13, El Rufai had signed it into law, 18 days before\nthe end of year. Specifically, N131.45 billion was for capital expenditure\nwhile N83.46 billion was for recurrent spending, representing a 61: 39\nspending ratio. In brief, Kaduna state had devoted N44.84 billion on\neducation, N10 billion on the health sector and N24.50 billion on\ninfrastructure.\n\nSimilarly, for the second time, the governor had presented the 2018 draft\nbudget, detailing revenue and expenditure, to the House of Assembly on October\n13, 2017. The estimate, tagged \u2018\u2019Budget of Consolidation\u2019\u2019, was N216.5 billion\nin size and out of that amount, N131 billion was earmarked for capital\nexpenditure, representing 60.5% of the total budget. Likewise, N85 billion was\nset aside for recurrent spending, translating into 39.4% of the Appropriation\nBill. In addition, Education, Health and Social Development took the largest\nchunk of 39.2% like previous years. El Rufai, two months later, had signed the\nbudget into law in December.\n\nMore or less, last year\u2019s budget followed the same trajectory, structure and\ncomposition like the previous ones. In August, 2018, the governor had\npresented the proposed estimate to the State Assembly. The legislators, for\nthree months, had deliberated on draft budget, tinkered with the figures and\nslightly increased its size. Afterwards, the House of Assembly passed it on\nNovember 28 but El Rufai signed the budget 23 days later. Specifically, he\nsigned it into law on December 21, 2018, ten days before the end of the year.\nIn fact, the N157.449 billion budget comprised N94.47 billion and N62.97\nbillion capital and recurrent expenditures respectively. Indeed, the budget\nmaintained the 60: 40 capital-to-recurrent expenditure ratio, like preceding\nones. Likewise, Education and Health sectors took the lion share of N39.14\nbillion or 41% of the budget.\n\nIn October 2019, Deputy Governor Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, at General Hassan\nKatsina House, presented the 2020 draft budget at a Town Hall meeting, where\nstakeholders made inputs. Specifically, this was the first budget, after the\nfederal government, by any sub national government. In 2020, the sum of N245.\n4 billion has been proposed and the estimate, like others before it, placed\nemphasis on capital expenditure. In effect, N177. 29 billion was devoted to it\nwhile the rest N68.11 billion will be spent on recurrent expenditure. In\nsummary, 72.24% will go to the former sub-head and 27.76%, according to the\nestimate, will be spent on the latter. Likewise, N33. 92 billion and N23.34\nbillion has been allocated the Education and Health sectors respectively.\n\nSignificantly, this year\u2019s budget was benchmarked at $57 per barrel but the\nCoronavirus, the rampaging pandemic, is threatening the entire 2020 financial\nyear. Already, the Federal Government has made changes to its budget,\nfollowing the falling prices of crude oil at the international market. On\nMarch 8, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab\nShamsuna Ahmed, confirmed what was widely speculated. The Government,\naccording to her, will reduce capital budget by 20% and recurrent expenditures\nwill be slashed by 25%. Sadly, the situation may get worse as the price of\ncrude oil, since the announcement, has not substantially improved . Obviously,\na lot of belt tightening measures are in the offing and ultimately, they will\naffect both the cost and standard of living across board.\n\nSpecifically, Malam Nasir El Rufai admitted to the tough times ahead but\ninstead of scare-mongering, the governor\u2019s home truth was reassuring. El\nRufai, from the outset, foresaw this crisis and to ameliorate it, he set up an\nEconomic Crisis Committee, chaired by the Deputy Governor, to fashion out ways\nand means to contain the expected revenue shortfall. The Committee, in its\nreport, built two likely scenarios and proffered broad solutions to the\nproblem. The Committee pointed out that Kaduna State\u2019s gross annual revenues\ncould fall by as much as N17bn if crude oil prices remain around $30 a barrel.\nConversely, the revenue shortfall could plummet with as much as N24bn if crude\nprices fall to $20 per barrel. Bluntly, it stated that capital projects will\nbe affected if either of the two oil price scenarios persist, except fiscal\nand monetary policy realism are adopted by the Federal Government.\n\nConsequently, El Rufai rolled out some austerity measures, following the\nreport, to absorb the shocks of the revenue shortfall. Specifically, the cost\nof running government, including overhead costs, has been reduced by 50%,\nbuying of fuel and stationery have been centralised to cut cost. In addition,\nforeign trips have been cancelled and local travels will be minimised as part\nof the belt tightening measures. Likewise, the ongoing recruitment process\nshould be concluded, El Rufai has directed, but resumption of new recruits\nwill be put on hold until the fiscal situation improves. In summary, costs\nwill be cut across board and revenue sources will be expanded, especially\npresumptive tax, land use charges and development levy, he explained.\n\nSignificantly, on March 20, El Rufai amplified why his administration took\nthese measures, in a live media chat at Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, with some\nselect broadcast-journalists. The governor, for the umpteenth time, promised\nto pay salaries and pension as and when due, at the prevailing N30,000 minimum\nwage. In addition, he promised that the revenue shortfall will only affect\nrecurrent expenditure as capital projects, including Health and Education\nprojects, will continue apace. These projects, according to him, benefit the\npeople directly and there are some of the basic dividends of democracy that\nthe masses enjoy from government.\n\nInstructively, even in the face of economic gloom, El Rufai has continued to\nput the \u2018\u2019people first\u2019\u2019 and by so doing, he has raised hope and garnered\ntheir support. Consequently, all things being equally, they will be ready to\ndo the needful like paying taxes and levies, believing that they will be the\nultimate beneficiaries. That way, COVID-19 Pandemic will be limited to the\nhealth issue that it should have been, and not the ogre of economic recession\nthat it is threatening to be. By so doing, Kaduna State will not only be great\nagain but the government will continue putting the people first, by executing\npopulist projects. Indeed, Malam Nasir El Rufai is a man of the people, as\nagainst a representative of band of tiny parasitic and rapacious elite.\n\n_Ibraheem is Special Assistant on Media and Publicity_\n\n### RECEIVE ALERTS FROM THECABLE\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/whatsappicon.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\nWHATSAPP [08113975334](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2348113975334)\n\n[![](https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/09/twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\nTWITTER [@thecableng](http://www.twitter.com/thecableng)\n\n_Copyright 2020 TheCable.

Pelosi And Chuck Schumer Hold Press Event To Mark Anniversary Of For\nThe People Act](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/PepCmit8MQymmIHiURPn6MWprMc=/0x0:5051x3445/1200x800/filters:focal\\(2122x1319:2930x2127\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66600553/1211588247.jpg.0.jpg) House\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u201cpretty much ran a\ngood-cop/bad-cop number\u201d on Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to get a good\ndeal for ordinary Americans, writes Gene Lyons. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty\nImages\n\nOne thing we\u2019re learning, in our collective sorrow, is how many mayors and\ngovernors of both parties there are across America who are infinitely more\ncapable of responding to a crisis than anybody in the White House.\n\nNew York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, Illinois\u2019 J.B. Pritzker, Ohio\u2019s Mike DeWine and\nothers have earned justifiable praise for effective leadership throughout the\ncoronavirus pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, although you\u2019d hardly know it due to the relative dearth of press\ncoverage, emergency benefits extended to ordinary citizens by Congress last\nweek could mean economic salvation for millions.\n\n# Columnists\n\n_In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and\ncultural commentary._\n\nAlso largely unknown to the public is that their underappreciated champion has\nbeen House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 pointedly excluded from the White House\nbill-signing ceremony along with every other Democrat in Washington.\n\nSuch are the political facts of life in a nation under siege.\n\nWith TV news networks and their star performers focusing upon Rose Garden\ntheatrics, they\u2019ve neglected the story of how Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer\noutwitted and outmaneuvered GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to the\npoint that he felt compelled to admit that \u201cbecause the country was desperate\nfor results ... I literally told my own Republican colleagues to \u2018gag and vote\nfor it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe final Senate vote was 96-0. That\u2019s a lot of gagging.\n\nUnlike the original Republican bill, with its proposed $500 billion in\ncorporate bailouts, the $2.2 trillion Pelosi-Schumer effort \u2014 formally known\nas the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act \u2014 added $150 billion\nfor hard-pressed state and local governments, another $150 billion for\nhospitals, and $31 billion for schools. That, and $25 billion for food stamps.\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s still plenty of cash for Fortune 500 companies, but\noversight has been added to prevent it becoming a political slush fund.\n\nHowever, the real game-changers for hard-pressed families, as well as the\npotential salvation of the U.S. economy, are two features many voters are\nunaware of: paycheck-protection loans, enabling small businesses to retain\nemployees for up to eight weeks, that needn\u2019t be repaid; and greatly expanded\nunemployment insurance for individuals who lose their jobs due to the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nThe original McConnell bill called for one-time $1,200 checks to be sent to\nevery taxpayer \u2014 definitely useful, but hardly a bonanza. To that, Pelosi and\nDemocrats added unemployment insurance providing an additional 13 weeks of\ncash assistance to state-funded programs. The CARE Act also expands\neligibility to include part-time, self-employed and so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d\nworkers such as Uber drivers and food delivery services, providing up to $600\na week income for those practicing social distancing.\n\nDo the arithmetic. That\u2019s upward of $10,000 between now and the end of June.\nWith plenty to worry about, people can at least quit obsessing about money.\nThey\u2019ll have sufficient funds for rent, food, utilities and other necessities.\nNobody\u2019s got to risk his or her life to keep the children fed.\n\n(Or pets, for that matter. Around our house there would be hell to pay if\nMartin and Albert, our two orange tabby rodent consultants, ever glimpsed the\nporcelain bottom of what we call \u201cthe endless supper dish.\u201d)\n\nAnd the best news for the economy is that most of this cash would be spent\nimmediately and locally, bolstering enterprises that need it to keep going. So\nnext time you hear some bloviating politico attack the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Democrats,\nyou can thank Nancy and Chuck.\n\nOf course, unemployment insurance is administered by the states, many of which\nimpose burdensome regulations required by skinflint legislators ever fearful\nthat lazy people will take advantage. (Not that we haven\u2019t all known somebody\nwho\u2019s tried.) But these are special circumstances, and this is where the\naforementioned state governors come in. Times aren\u2019t normal: It\u2019s their\ncollective duty to clear the hurdles and let the money flow.\n\nAnyway, how this all happened is that Pelosi and Schumer pretty much ran a\ngood-cop/bad-cop number on McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin,\nwho did the negotiating for the Republicans. Or, as the speaker later\nexplained, \u201cWe did jiujitsu on it, that it went from a corporate-first\nproposal that the Republicans put forth in the Senate to a Democratic workers-\nfirst legislation.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s a vastly overrated legislative strategist to begin with \u2014 mainly\ngood at saying no. When he presented a my-way-or-the-highway trillion-dollar\npackage in late March, Democrats shocked him by voting no on a procedural\nissue. Needing 60 votes to pass, the chamber deadlocked at 48-48.\n\nRepublicans threw a big hissy fit. \u201cIs that what we\u2019ve come to?\u201d ever-\nmelodramatic Maine Sen. Susan Collins asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t have another day. We\ndon\u2019t have another hour. We don\u2019t have another minute to delay acting.\u201d\n\nOK, fine. So do you want to negotiate with Chuck or Nancy? Good cop or bad\ncop? McConnell went into hiding. Mnuchin basically gave Schumer most of what\nhe wanted. Possibly because it was good policy. But certainly because nobody\nwanted to tangle with Pelosi, who\u2019s smarter and tougher than them all.\n\n_Send letters to:_[ _letters@suntimes.com_](mailto:letters@suntimes.com) _._\n\n##  Next Up In [Commentary](https://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion)\n\n  * [Zoom seders: iPads, iPhones and laptops on holiday tables as Passover adapts to COVID-19 pandemic](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/7/21212966/zoom-seders-ipads-iphones-virtual-on-holiday-tables-as-passover-adapts-to-covid-19-pandemic-pesach)\n  * [How to avoid a national voting disaster on Nov. 3](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/7/21202092/elections-coronavirus-covid-19-vote-by-mail-suntimes-editorial-voter-fraud)\n  * [If the mayor says she needed to get her hair done, she needed to get it done](https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2020/4/7/21212950/mayor-lori-lightfoot-coronavirus-haircut-stay-home-save-lives)\n  * [At Mount Sinai, \u2018moments of chaos and calm\u2019](https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/7/21209554/coronavirus-mount-sinai-doctors-nurses-ppe-covid-19-pandemic-steinberg)\n  * [How the CDC and the FDA wrecked the American economy](https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2020/4/7/21212901/cdc-fda-covid-19-coronavirus-epidemic)\n  * [When to expect your SBA loan: No timetable as system hit with computer, other delays](https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2020/4/6/21211392/small-business-administration-loans-timeline-coronavirus-lenders)\n\n###  Most Read\n\n  1.

Predictably, Covid-19\nmay be spreading up to [eight times\nfaster](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/middleeast/coronavirus-\nisrael-cases-orthodox.html) among Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jews than it has\namong the general population.\n\nThe problem has become so severe that the Israeli government [has locked\ndown](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-locks-down-ultra-orthodox-\ncity-hit-hard-coronavirus-n1175736) an ultra-Orthodox city, Bnei Brak, and\nroadblocks prevent residents from leaving it.\n\nIn the Pakistani financial capital of Karachi, which has a population of\naround 15 million, the provincial government ordered a lockdown during Friday\nprayers when the faithful typically gather in mosques. On Friday enraged\nworshippers [clashed with police](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-\ncoronavirus-southasia/pakistan-worshippers-clash-with-police-trying-to-\nenforce-coronavirus-lockdown-idUSKBN21L0W1) as they tried to enforce the\nlockdown.\n\nRead More\n\nIn Iraq, in late March abaya-clad women crowded the shrine of Imam Musa al-\nKadhim in Baghdad while implying their faith [kept them\nsafe](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-25/pandemic-is-hard-\non-middle-east-faithful) from the coronavirus.\n\n[![When faith threatens public\nhealth](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)![When\nfaith threatens public\nhealth](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191225172641-01a-trump-evangelicals-\nslaveholding-christianity-large-169.jpg)](/2020/03/24/opinions/coronavirus-\nreligious-freedom-faith-liberty-moss/index.html)\n\n[When faith threatens public health](/2020/03/24/opinions/coronavirus-\nreligious-freedom-faith-liberty-moss/index.html)\n\nOn Sunday, Pastor Tony Spell of the Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge,\nLouisiana [held services](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-\ncoronavirus-usa-church/louisiana-church-holds-services-defying-coronavirus-\nstay-at-home-order-idUSKBN21N0UU) despite stay at home orders from Louisiana's\ngovernor because of the pandemic. Channeling his inner Franklin D. Roosevelt\n(FDR), Spell told hundreds of his parishioners, many of whom had arrived on\nmore than two dozen buses, that they had \"nothing to fear but fear itself.\"\n\nThe danger of such religious gatherings is underlined by anecdotes of how the\ncoronavirus may have spread in countries such as France and India. A prayer\nmeeting at a church in Mulhouse, France in late February [unwittingly kicked\noff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-a-prayer-meeting-at-a-\nfrench-megachurch-may-have-led-to-scores-of-coronavirus-\ndeaths/2020/04/01/fe478ca0-7396-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html) \"what soon\nbecame one of Europe's largest regional clusters of infections, which then\nquickly spread across the country and eventually overseas,\" according to the\nWashington Post. In another case reported by the Washington Post, last month\nin India thousands of members of a Muslim missionary group had a gathering in\nNew Delhi, which subsequently became a \"super-spreader\" event as attendees\n[went on to spread the\nvirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-\ntablighi-jamaat-delhi/2020/04/02/abdc5af0-7386-11ea-\nad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html) around the country when they dispersed.\n\nThe US should look to these cases as examples of what not to do.

But the\npresident should consider the consequences and put the health of the American\npeople first.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * [World](/world \"visit

Polis said that the state of Colorado will\nextend a statewide stay-at-home order from April 11 to April 26 due to\ncoronavirus.\n\n### 6:12 p.m. \u2014 Nearly 100 small towns in Colorado held elections today. They\nhad to get creative to do it\n\n![](https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/04/Foxfield-\nElex-1024x683.jpg)Courtesy of Randi GalliwayFoxfield's town clerk and other\nelection officials show off their COVID-19 prevention measures for Tuesday's\nelections.\n\nNinety-nine towns and cities across Colorado held local elections today \u2014 and\nsome had to improvise a bit to get it done.\n\nThe Arapahoe County town of Foxfield's regular polling place, the fire\nstation, is closed to the public right now in an effort to protect first\nresponders from being exposed to COVID-19.\n\nInstead, the town of 800 set up a drive-through vote center in a resident's\ndriveway.\n\n\"We created what we call \u2018reachers\u2019 \u2014 baskets on polls \u2014 that we [use to] hand\nthe paperwork out and they hand it back in, so we can maintain our social\ndistancing,\u201d Town Clerk Randi Galliway said.\n\nGalliway would have rather delayed the election, but that would have required\na law change by the state legislature, which is currently on hiatus because of\nthe pandemic. Home-rule municipalities do have the power to set the date for\ntheir elections and some, like the Eagle County town of Gypsum, did choose to\ndelay several months.\n\nDuring statewide elections, clerks are required to mail ballots to all\nregistered voters. But smaller local elections are often still conducted\nthrough polling places, with mail ballots only going to those who request to\nvote absentee.\n\nElection processing may also take longer for this election. Galliway plans to\nlet ballots sit for several days before tallying them, in the hope that any\nviruses on the paper will be inactive by the time they\u2019re processed.

That is the opposite of what we should learn from this\ncrisis.\n\nWe should put the people of America first. Our decidedly non socialistic,\ncapitalist system has put the economy first. Americans (especially those with\nless income) have been a big part of the equation that John feels favors other\ncountries. We have been buying countless products for years clearly marked,\n\"Made in China.\" That is because we could not afford not to. Jobs, jobs, jobs,\nand an always growing economy have not lifted up lots of Americans, but just\nmade it possible for them to buy cheap foreign goods.\n\nThe coronavirus has slowed down our treadmill economy so abruptly that many\nhave fallen off. Most of those splayed on the floor need their jobs to just\nsurvive. Even if this country put itself first, it doesn\u2019t change the economic\nsystem, the next time a pandemic slashes jobs, lower income people will suffer\nbadly again.\n\nI just saw a post on the Chelmsford Patch from a woman saying her husband was\nin a job not supposed to be shut down: construction. But so many construction\nprojects were canceled that he is out of work. She asked how would they\nsurvive if the shutdown lasted more than a few weeks. As in this case, a lot\nof the jobs put on hold would not benefit from the America first movement.\n\nThe virus has forced us to conduct an economic experiment that we would never,\never have done: Take away a huge number of jobs randomly across a broad\nspectrum, and see how it affects people. Unemployment caused by economic\ndownturns tends to drop expendable jobs. This artificial job loss has exposed\na huge population of people like ourselves that have so little economic\nsecurity. If the sole purpose of our economy was not just to create profits\nand paychecks, but was to direct human activity in a meaningful way to build\nsustainable communities, putting jobs on hold would just slow down our\nefforts.\n\nWhen the pandemic is over, the historians will analyze the damages done. I\nwager that the citizens of the social democratic countries in Europe will have\nsuffered less economically than Americans, because the Europeans had more\neconomic security. Putting America first won\u2019t help. We need to put people\nbefore jobs, and jobs before profits.\n\n_Amiro is a resident of Chelmsford and has a Masters Degree in Psychology_\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://facebook.com/LowellSun)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/LowellSunNews)\n  * [ RSS ](https://www.lowellsun.com/feed/)\n\n##  Most Popular\n\n  1.

The ability to work from home correlates\nwith all kinds of social and class privilege; the ability to tolerate a\nhousebound existence depends on your home and situation; the opportunity to\ngrocery shop for one or two weeks at a time depends on cashflow.\n\nWhen it comes to putting social distancing into practice, our family is\nprivileged in every way. My husband and I already worked from home, and\nalready homeschooled one of our kids; only one member of our family finds\nthemselves newly homebound. We have every kind of device and gadget you might\nneed in order to stay happy and productive inside this house, and you might\nargue that we've been in training for this moment for the past fifteen years,\nsince we mostly spent our time online and at home, anyhow. Most of all, we\nhave the money and time for things like stocking up on groceries, disinfecting\nall incoming packages and purchases, and coming up with a way to measure the\n6-foot distance I need to keep with my walking buddy. We've been able to\neffectively seal off all social contact with minimal consequences.\n\nWe haven't gone to these extremes because we are especially worried about\ngetting COVID-19 ourselves; nobody in our home is immune compromised, and at\nthe moment, we're not even seeing my (very healthy) 81-year-old mother. We're\ndoing this as an expression of citizenship and solidarity, so that we don't\nrun the risk of spreading the virus, or of getting sick ourselves and taxing\nan already overloaded system.\n\nMy feeling is that privileged homebodies like us have a duty to undertake\nsocial distancing with this kind of rigor, precisely so that healthcare\nresources are available for people who are going to have a much harder time\navoiding exposure. I don't want the lovely grocery clerk at the IGA to go\nwithout an ICU bed or ventilator just because dumb f*&*ers like me can't skip\na haircut, or because newly remote workers are still making face-to-face dates\nwith two or three friends. ([That's all it takes to break the logic of social\ndistancing and set the whole chain of transmission going\nagain!](https://medium.com/@jpsmithalt/hold-the-line-17231c48ff17) )\n\n### What people are reading\n\n  * [Now experts say you can give COVID-19 to pets ](/2020/04/06/news/now-experts-say-you-can-give-covid-19-pets)\n  * [Don't let Takaya's death be in vain](/2020/04/07/opinion/dont-let-takayas-death-be-vain)\n  * [Kenney's billions for Keystone XL is ballast for a sinking ship ](/2020/04/07/opinion/kenneys-billions-keystone-xl-ballast-sinking-ship)\n\nBut what if we made that logic into policy? This week the New England Journal\nof Medicine published[ an article on allocating scarce resources during a\npandemic](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2005114). Among other\nguidelines, it recommends that healthcare workers should receive priority\ntreatment, because we need them back on their feet in order to keep the system\nrunning for everyone. The article also suggests that, all things equal between\ntwo patients, people who have volunteered for COVID research should receive\npriority for treatment -- as a way to reward and motivate research\nparticipation.\n\nI wonder if the same logic should be extended to other front-line workers.\nOnce you've looked after the healthcare workers, perhaps we should also\nprioritize other first responders (police and fire), but after that, we need\nto look at prioritizing the new front-line workers who have had to (or have\nchosen to) keep working while the rest of us go into retreat.\n\nIf two people have equal risks and prognoses, and are similar ages, I'd\nsuggest that the grocery clerk who's sick should be prioritized over the\nwriter or lawyer or university student who just didn't make an effort. This is\nthe kind of guideline that the Public Health Agency of Canada could build into\nethical guidelines, equivalent to the [patient prioritization guidance built\ninto its resource allocation guidelines for pandemic\ninfluenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/flu-\ninfluenza/canadian-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-planning-guidance-health-\nsector/resource-management-guidelines-for-health-care-facilities-during-an-\ninfluenza-pandemic.html#A214).\n\nThis would have three big benefits, if publicized:\n\n  1. Encourage privileged people who can distance to make the maximum effort, because we know we'll be at the back of the line,\n  2. Provide some comfort, encouragement and appreciation to front line workers in transportation, essential retail et cetera, who are in a very scary and stressful situation, and,\n  3. At least slightly mitigate the really terrible class and race dynamics of this crisis, in which[ poor people and people of color are going to be sick and dying at higher rates for all kinds of reasons](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-poor-and-marginalized-will-be-the-hardest-hit-by-coronavirus/).\n\nI know that the idea of stepping to the back of the line might feel very\nuncomfortable for the kinds of privileged folk who donate to political\ncampaigns or run tech companies or run their own small businesses. I know that\n_saying_ you'll step to the back of the line is easy\u2026.until the moment when\nyou're in that hospital waiting room, wondering if you'll get the last\navailable ICU bed. And I know that our society needs lawyers and engineers and\naccountants, and that those professional credentials represent years of social\ninvestment in education as well as personal effort.\n\n> \"My feeling is that privileged homebodies like us have a duty to undertake\n> social distancing with this kind of rigor, precisely so that healthcare\n> resources are available for people who are going to have a much harder time\n> avoiding exposure.\"\n\n[\n__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-\nneed-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-\nfirst&text=%22My%20feeling%20is%20that%20privileged%20homebodies%20like%20us%20have%20a%20duty%20to%20undertake%20social%20distancing%20with%20this%20kind%20of%20rigor%2C%20precisely%20so%20that%20healthcare%20resources%20are%20available%20for%20people%20who%20are%20going%20to%20have%20a%20much%20harder%20time%20avoiding%20exposure.%22\n\"Tweet this\")\n\nBut what this crisis has made abundantly clear is that our society is also\ndesperately, vitally dependent on front-line and low-skill workers who are too\noften devalued and marginalized in our economy, our communities and our\nculture. Every time you make that scary weekly grocery trip -- then run home\nto wash your hands, along with every package you've purchased -- you're making\na brief journey into the day-by-day, hour-by-hour, lived experience of people\nwho are putting their lives at risk while the rest of us cocoon safely at\nhome. We can all show how much we appreciate their courage and their\nconsistency by committing to resource allocation guidelines that -- for once!\n-- put working people first.\n\n  \n  \n\n### Don't miss out on the latest news\n\n[Sign up for our daily\nbriefing](/newsletter?utm_source=article&utm_medium=inline_cta&utm_campaign=newsletter_signup)\n\n[![Trust Project logo](/profiles/natobs/themes/custom/nat/img/logos/Trust-\nLogo-Horizontal.svg)](/about#trust-project)\n\n## Share this article\n\n  * [ __Share _  on Facebook_](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-need-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-first&t=We%20need%20healthcare%20allocation%20policies%20that%20put%20working%20people%20first \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __Share _  on Twitter_](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-need-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-first&text=We%20need%20healthcare%20allocation%20policies%20that%20put%20working%20people%20first&via=NatObserver \"Share this on Twitter\")\n\n  * [ __](http://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-need-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-first&title=We%20need%20healthcare%20allocation%20policies%20that%20put%20working%20people%20first \"Submit this post on reddit.com\")\n  * [ __](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-need-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-first&title=We%20need%20healthcare%20allocation%20policies%20that%20put%20working%20people%20first&summary=How%20can%20we%20help%20and%20support%20the%20people%20whose%20work%20puts%20them%20at%20risk%20for%20COVID-19%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Anot%20just%20healthcare%20workers%2C%20but%20folks%20who%20are%20still%20going%20to%20work%20everyday%20as%20grocery%20clerks%20or%20delivery%20people%20or%20bus%20drivers%3F&source=National%20Observer \"Publish this post to LinkedIn\")\n  * [ __](https://wa.me/?text=https%3A//www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/27/opinion/we-need-healthcare-allocation-policies-put-working-people-first \"Share via Whatsapp\")\n  * [ __](https://www.nationalobserver.com/forward?path=node/19478 \"Send to a friend\")\n\n __\n\nMarch 27th 2020\n\n  * [ ![Profile picture](https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/nat_thumbnail_small/public/img/2020/03/27/alexandrasamuel_headshot.jpg?itok=BpHKzklM) ](/u/alexandra-samuel)\n\n    * [Alexandra Samuel](/u/alexandra-samuel)\n    * Guest Contributor\n    * [@awsamuel ](https://www.twitter.com/awsamuel  \"Follow Alexandra Samuel on Twitter\")\n\n##  Comments\n\nIn order to post a comment, you need to [subscribe](/subscribe) first.

(Photo: Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention)\n\nBrevard County Commission Chairman Bryan Lober said the woman had spent 13\ndays at a Health First-affiliated hospital, and died Monday afternoon.\n\nLober and Maria Stahl, administrator for the Florida Health Department in\nBrevard, said both of the people who died also had underlying health\nconditions.\n\n **More:**[Coronavirus can be life and death matter for those with major\nhealth issues](/story/news/2020/04/07/coronavirus-life-and-death-matter-those-\nmajor-health-issues/5110852002/)\n\n **More:**[Coronavirus mythbusters: Falsehoods about the disease also are\ngoing viral](/story/news/2020/03/27/coronavirus-myths-and-cures-go-viral-\nflorida-health-urge-caution/2901771001/)\n\n\"Unfortunately, as we have seen by having two (deaths) announced at the same\ntime, there are certain to be more,\" Lober said, especially as case numbers\ncontinue to rise. \"It's likely not going to be long before we see another\nlocal death.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday evening there have been 98 cases of the coronavirus in Brevard\nCounty. On Tuesday morning Stahl said there are 28 in which the patients are\nhospitalized, with six of those patients placed on ventilators.\n\nStahl said the case count in Brevard has been increasing by about 10 a day.\n\nThe deaths come after three firefighters in Titusville have also tested\npositive for the virus. None of the three took seriously ill, according to\nBattalion Chief Greg Sutton, and one of them has already returned to work.\n\nStahl said the DOH was aware of the two active cases and is doing contact\ntracing.\n\nOther fire agencies around the county have been isolating firefighters who\ncome into contact with coronavirus patients, including five responders in\nMelbourne and four in Palm Bay. Each of those firefighters must wait 14 days\nbefore they can be medically cleared to return to work.\n\nCommissioner Lober said everyone needs to seriously follow the recommendations\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Florida Department\nof Health.\n\nHe said Brevard residents should stay at home if they don't need to go out,\nespecially if they are in a high-risk category because of advanced age or a\npre-existing medical condition.\n\n\"Do not go to a store unless you really need to,\" Stahl said, and try to keep\ngrocery shopping to once a week.\n\nStahl said people out jogging or taking their dog for a walk also should\npractice social distancing guidelines.\n\nLober said people who fail to follow the guidelines should have their will,\ntheir health care proxy and their beneficiary information in order, \"because\nthis is not a joke. This is something that, as we've seen this morning, will\npotentially kill you.\"\n\n\"This virus \u2014 I've seen on social media allegations that it's cooked up by one\npolitical party or another, or it's being made into much ado about nothing,\"\nLober said. \"These folks who lost loved ones over the past 24 hours, I\nguarantee you don't view this as much ago about nothing.\"\n\nLober emphasized that the coronavirus \"is not a myth. It's not a conspiracy.\nIt's not a hoax. And it could kill you or someone you love, if you don't take\nadequate precautions and follow the guidelines. This is not something that\nshould be politicized. This is not something that should be taken trivially or\nlightly.\"\n\nAccording to Lober, the 76-year-old woman who died of the coronavirus had been\nin a Health First hospital for 13 days before she died Monday.\n\nBut her case doesn\u2019t appear in the state\u2019s daily log of cases until April 3,\njust three days before she died.\n\nThis means she had been sick for at least 10 days before she was confirmed as\na COVID-19 patient. Whether this was due to a significant delay in processing\nthe tests, a lack of testing availability, a delay in administering a test or\na combination of those factors is unclear.\n\nThe scope of testing in Brevard has been a matter of widespread public\nconcern, with many people saying that they have been unable to get tested\nalthough they present many of the symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nTo help address the demand, OMNI Healthcare opened up it's drive-thru testing\nfacility to the general public in Melbourne at 9 a.m.Tuesday.\n\nAccording to OMNI Healthcare chief medical director, Craig Deligdish, by 4:30\np.m., the site had tested 450 people. He said it takes about two minutes to\nconduct the test with results returned within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nCareful scheduling of appointments has made process faster he said, adding\nthat they had learned that lesson Sunday when they accepted unscheduled drive\nins during a debut for about 200 first responders, including state troopers,\nlocal police, firefighters, health care workers and employees of Publix and\nWinn Dixie.\n\n\"We learned that if people don\u2019t have appointment it's difficult.\" Deligdish\nsaid, adding, that by adding more staff to help schedule drive-thru\nappointments without any criteria requirements, he believed OMNI was \"light\nyears\" ahead of other testing facilities.\n\nEarlier in the day, Stahl, the local health department administrator, said the\nBrevard Health Department had available time slots at its facility in Viera,\nwhich does require a patient to have symptoms or a doctor's note or is over 65\nyears old or has a preexisting medical condition to be tested.\n\nThe criteria and a perceived shortage of tests has led to criticism of the\nhealth department and raised questions over its management of the process.\n\nThat management came under scrutiny again with news that an FDOH shipment of\n1,000 collection kits for testing COVID-19 was mistakenly delivered to Broward\nCounty instead of Brevard, according to an email sent to county officials\nMonday that was obtained by FLORIDA TODAY.\n\n\"We contacted (Florida Division of Emergency Management) and they are sending\n1,000 kits to Brevard now,\" the email, which was sent by Brevard Emergency\nManagement director Kimberly Prosser states.\n\nAnita Stremmel, Assistant County Health Department Director, in an email\nassured that \"DOH-Brevard continues to have available appointments for the\ndrive-through testing we are conducting.\"\n\nThe email also notes that tests running through commercial testing providers\nsuch as Quest and Labcorp are running between 3 and 16 days behind schedule.\n\n\"Positive results from private (non-FDOH) providers reflect a status that is\nabout a week to two weeks old. There are currently over 250 tests awaiting\nresults,\" Prosser wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday said processing results is getting better, taking about 24 hours\nfor the state labs and about four days for private labs.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health is not publicly keeping track of suspected\ncases of COVID-19 or pending and negative test results from private labs.\n\nBut the misdirected collection kit issued was raised at Tuesday's Brevard\nCounty Commission meeting by Commission John Tobia. In response, Stahl said\nthe Brevard DOH had received 300 new kits from FDOH, and separately Brevard\u2019s\nemergency management office had also received 1,000 kits from the state\ndivision of emergency mangament but these could not yet be used as the testing\nmedium was awaiting FDA approval.\n\nKimberly Prosser, speaking to a reporter at the sidelines of the county\ncommission meeting said she expected that approval to happen \u201cany day now.\u201d\n\n![A sign at Wickham Park in Melbourne has an important reminder during the\ncoronavirus pandemic.](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/presto/2020/04/06/PBRE/eec3a634-9d7d-45f3-9b7c-e2542f973917-Scenes_in_April_of_South_Brevard_During_COVID-19_8d.jpg?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp)Buy\nPhoto\n\nA sign at Wickham Park in Melbourne has an important reminder during the\ncoronavirus pandemic.

We must not confuse them as being the end objective,\" Verite\nResearch Executive Director Dr. Nishan De Mel told Mirror Business.\n\n  \nThe senior economist said, therefore focusing directly on the goal of\nimproving material outcomes can provide more clarity for economic decision\nmaking, especially in the short term.\n\nAccording to de Mel, there are two kinds of human vulnerabilities the relevant\nauthorities should be concerned about, in the present context.\n\n  \nThe first is the elderly who are most at risk, in terms of serious negative\noutcomes from COVID-19, and the second vulnerability the country should be\nconcerned about is that of the poor who depend on daily income for their\nsustenance.\n\n  \nWhile special measures can be considered for protecting and supporting the\nelderly, pausing economic activity to protect the spread of COVID-19 can have\nquite serious negative consequences on the lives of poor daily wage earners,\nde Mel stressed.\n\n  \n\"The methods for protecting the spread of COVID-19 should be sensitive to the\nnegative impacts of those methods on the lives of the most vulnerable. The\ngoal should be to reduce overall harm, therefore the methods selected to\nreduce the spread of COVID-19 do matter,\" the economist cautioned.\n\n  \nStarting Monday (16), the government declared an all island holiday, which was\nextended till yesterday. The move led to a halt of operations in the business\ncommunity, including the stock market, which delivered a blow to daily wage\nearners and those who are self-employed.\n\n  \nDe Mel opined that stopping economic production and services declaring\n\"holidays\" is too blunt a method for reducing people movement, when the focus\nis on reducing overall harm.\n\n  \nAccording to him, a more targeted and less damaging method of reducing the\nspread of COVID-19 could be adopted through arrangements such as 'work from\nhome' and for such must be supported by the government regulations and policy.\n\n  \nDe Mel noted that epidemiologically, it would seem that the best strategy for\nany country was to work on slowing down the rate at which the virus will\nspread as it would ensure the number of people who are ill with the virus at\nany given time, and need medical care to get well, does not exceed the\ncapacity of the health system.  \n\"Therefore, the level of lock-down can be decided based on the mathematics of\na sustainable spread,\" he added.\n\n\n\n## __ Comments - 1\n\n  * Buddhist Friday, 20 March 2020 09:09 PM \n\nPeople First, Economy Next and lastly Elections.

[Coronavirus](/coronavirus \"Navigate to Coronavirus\")\n\n# Multnomah County sees first cases of coronavirus in homeless population\n\nUpdated Apr 07, 2020; Posted Apr 07, 2020\n\n36\n\nStreet Roots delivers hygiene supplies and coronavirus resources to homeless\ncampers\n\nBy [ Molly Harbarger | The Oregonian/OregonLive\n](http://connect.oregonlive.com/staff/mharbarger/posts.html \"Molly Harbarger |\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive\")\n\nTwo homeless people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Multnomah County,\n[bringing the virus to one of the most vulnerable populations in\nOregon](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-could-hit-\noregon-homeless-population-particularly-hard.html).\n\nThe county public health department confirmed the cases Tuesday, but did not\nprovide details about when the results were reported. There have been 276\nconfirmed COVID-19 cases in Multnomah County so far.\n\n[Salem reported Oregon\u2019s first case of coronavirus in a homeless person on\nMarch 26](https://www.salemreporter.com/posts/2138/homeless-person-in-salem-\nquarantined-in-motel-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19), according to the\nSalem Reporter. Across the state, homeless people make up less than 1% of all\ncoronavirus cases, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nThe housing status of coronavirus patients is important because people who\nlive outside in harsh conditions are more likely to die from the virus. And,\nif they test positive, homeless people don\u2019t have anywhere to go that is safe\nand isolated to recuperate.\n\nPeople with little to no income and no place to cook are also more likely to\nbe in large gathering spaces to get food and other services -- a tinderbox for\nspreading the virus.\n\nMultnomah County Public Health declined to say where people were living when\ndiagnosed, but officials have also worried that the virus could move through\nhomeless shelters quickly.\n\nMultnomah County has opened nearly 400 beds in community centers and the\nOregon Convention Center to spread out residents and allow social distancing\nin shelters.\n\nOutreach workers have distributed hygiene kits and the city of Portland has\ninstalled hand-washing stations around the city.\n\n[![The homeless work to prevent the\ncoronavirus](https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/xrhak9CHL4IEA45wICcJko7iY6g=/450x0/smart/arc-\nanglerfish-arc2-prod-\nadvancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVXQP2Q7EVG55JUNECIIFTSJHU.JPG)](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-\nquestions-abound-in-homeless-camps-multnomah-county-launches-effort-to-\nprevent-outbreak-there.html)\n\n[Coronavirus questions abound in homeless camps.

Health officials say they are among the most\nvulnerable in a pandemic like the one sweeping through\nOregon.](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-questions-\nabound-in-homeless-camps-multnomah-county-launches-effort-to-prevent-outbreak-\nthere.html)\n\nA shelter for homeless people experiencing symptoms of coronavirus but who\nhaven\u2019t tested positive opened last week in the Jupiter Hotel with 12 people.\nOfficials said they expect to eventually use all 81 rooms.\n\nThe city-county Joint Office of Homeless Services also plans to open a shelter\nfor people who tested positive for COVID-19 but don\u2019t have a place to recover.\n\nThe county did not disclose where the two positive cases were currently\nstaying, but hospitals and homeless service providers have been given broad\nauthority and funding to pay for hotel rooms for people who are not sick\nenough to stay in a hospital but need a safe place to recuperate.\n\n\\-- Molly Harbarger\n\n[mharbarger@oregonian.com](mailto:mharbarger@oregonian.com) | 503-294-5923 |\n[@MollyHarbarger](https://twitter.com/MollyHarbarger)\n\n **Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive**[\n**newsletters**](https://subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters/) **and**[\n**podcasts**](https://www.oregonlive.com/podcasts/) **for the latest news and\ntop stories.**\n\nNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links\nwe may earn a commission.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n[![Advance Local logo](/pf/resources/images/footer-logo-\nadvance.svg?d=223)](https://www.advancelocal.com/)\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our [User\nAgreement](https://www.oregonlive.com/user-agreement/), [Privacy Policy and\nCookie Statement](https://www.oregonlive.com/privacy-policy/), and [Your\nCalifornia Privacy Rights](https://www.oregonlive.com/privacy-\npolicy/#california_top) (each updated 1/1/20).\n\n\u00a9 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

Cooper](https://whdh.com/author/steve-cooper/ \"Posts by Steve Cooper\")\n\nSALEM, MASS. (WHDH) - Family and co-workers are mourning a Salem Market Basket\nworker who died of coronavirus-related illness, while grocery employees from\nacross the area gathered in Boston Tuesday to call for more safety and better\npay during the pandemic.\n\nDavid Williams said his wife Vitalina, 59, died of the virus.\n\n\"I've lost my world, she created her own world. I've been happily lost in\nVitaworld for the last 19 years,\" Williams said. \"I'm trying to get my head\nout of the horror of it all.\"\n\n\"Look around you, look at the people you care about, love, know,\" Williams\nsaid. \"Remember how fleeting it is. We've lost an insurmountable amount when\nwe lost her.\"\n\nWilliams last worked at the store on March 26, according to Justine Griffin,\nspokesperson for Market Basket.\n\n\"Vitalina Williams was a part-time Market Basket associate who served in our\nSalem store for eleven years,\" Griffin said. \"Our hearts go out to her husband\nDave who is also a member of our Market Basket family.\"\n\nGriffin added counseling services were available for co-workers.\n\nTwo other associates at the Salem store have tested positive for the virus and\nhave quarantined themselves and their close contacts, Griffin said, and public\nhealth officials have been notified. A specialized cleaning crew has been\nbrought in to clean and disinfect the store as an added precaution.\n\nIn Boston, dozens of workers from across the region protested outside a Whole\nFoods, saying they need more PPE and hazard pay. Organizers said other workers\nwere afraid to join the protest for fears of being fired.\n\nWhole Foods said it is providing more PPE and an extra $2 an hour for\nemployees, but workers said their jobs are still dangerous.\n\n\"We're essential employees but we're people first,\" said worker Lisa Wilson,\nwho fears getting the coronavirus while on the job. \"I feel like they forgot\nthat a long time ago and it's time for them to remember that.\"\n\n_**This is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the\nlatest updates.**_\n\n**[Click here for more coronavirus\ncoverage.](https://whdh.com/?s=coronavirus)**\n\n _(Copyright (c) 2020 Sunbeam Television.

for once\u2026\n\n> The first implication of coronavirus economics is that a sharp slowdown in\n> activity is _necessary_ to contain the virus, because it represents the\n> social distancing required to reduce its spread. While usually a reasonable\n> proxy for economic health then, GDP is temporarily useless as a metric of\n> social welfare. We should ignore it.\n>\n> Second, ensuring this pause in activity does not do longer-lasting damage\n> should be our key objective. We want this to play out like a bad\n> agricultural season, or an extended \u201cChristmas week\u201d \u2013 with a Nike-tick\n> recovery or, given some spending will never occur, a V-shaped rebound that\n> redistributes activity over time.\n>\n> Both these points mean policy success should be judged not by short-run GDP,\n> but ability to mitigate distress among vulnerable households and businesses,\n> preventing business failures or mass layoffs in viable firms, or severe\n> hardship for those without significant savings or employer benefits. We can\n> judge longer success by assessing the path of GDP over 1-2 years.\n\nHere's how Norway is going about things\u2026\n\n> After the Danes yday the Norwegian govt has set out what it will do for\n> workers affected by\n> [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw):\n>\n> \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4 Full pay for those laid off for 20 days.  \n> \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4 Self employed get 80% of their average income the last 3 years - ceiling\n> 600k NOK (\u00a348000).  \n> \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4money for carers of Covid patients.\n>\n> -- Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) [March 16,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1239506183569977344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nPhoto by [Peggy_Marco](https://pixabay.com/users/Peggy_Marco-1553824) is\nlicensed under [CC BY-NC-\nSA](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee8552d07f8ad84709d2ea33a8656d24?s=100&r=g)\n\n[Mick Fealty](https://sluggerotoole.com/author/mickfealty/)\n\nMick is founding editor of Slugger.

https://str.sg/JgSS Copy\n\n[Vanessa Liu](/authors/vanessa-liu)\n\n[liuxyv@sph.com.sg](mailto:liuxyv@sph.com.sg \"liuxyv@sph.com.sg\")\n\nSINGAPORE - A $30 million grant has been launched to help local farms ramp up\ntheir production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish over the next six to 24\nmonths.\n\nThe 30x30 Express grant will help accelerate local food production in the\nshortest time possible, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Ministry\nfor the Environment and Water Resources in a joint statement on Wednesday\n(April 8).\n\nThe 30 by 30 goal - to produce enough food here to meet 30 per cent of the\ncountry's nutritional needs by 2030 - is part of the Republic's strategies\ntowards achieving long-term food security. Currently, less than 10 per cent of\nfood is grown locally.\n\nThe open grant call, which will be launched in the middle of this month, will\ncall on local agri-food players producing the three food types to submit their\nproposals to grow more, and faster.\n\nThe grant will let successful applicants defray upfront costs to increase\nproduction capacity within the next six to 24 months, including the co-funding\nof technology systems that will raise productivity on the farms.\n\nFish, leafy vegetables and eggs are the three most commonly consumed food\nitems in Singapore. In 2019, local farms produced 14 per cent of leafy\nvegetables, 26 per cent of eggs and 10 per cent of fish consumed here.\n\nDuring the supplementary budget debate on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Heng\nSwee Keat said that Covid-19 has underscored the importance of further\nstrengthening Singapore's supply chain resilience and food security, adding\nthat several Members of Parliament have urged the Government to further\ndevelop local food production capabilities.\n\n\"In my ministerial statement on the Resilience Budget, I spoke about our\nefforts to deal with the immediate challenges, by having a robust, multi-\npronged strategy to ensure a stable supply of safe food and essential items.\nWe have been working on this for years, and will continue to do so, \" Mr Heng,\nwho is also Finance Minister, said.\n\nMinister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said: \"It is\nimportant that these efforts are augmented by the support of consumers.\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Grow local: Greater urgency to produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional\nneeds locally by 2030](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/grow-local)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Coronavirus: Singapore made plans to ensure food security years ago,\nsays DPM Heng](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-\nmade-plans-to-ensure-food-security-years-ago-dpm-heng)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Parliament: Encourage growth of urban farming to secure Singapore's food\nsupplies, says Ang Wei\nNeng](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parliament-encourage-growth-of-\nurban-farming-here-to-secure-singapores-food-supplies)\n\nRelated Story\n\n#### [Over 100 local farms benefit from fund to help them modernise, innovate\nand increase yield](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-100-local-\nfarms-benefited-from-fund-to-help-modernise-innovate-and-increase-yield)\n\n\"Demand from consumers will spur our farmers to become more productive, and\nallow them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. This, in turn, will\nbolster our food security, and create good jobs for our people.\"\n\nThe new grant will serve to complement SFA's existing Agriculture Productivity\nFund, which aims to help farms here boost productivity by incorporating\nsustainable technologies into their farming systems.\n\nTo further bolster food production, the agencies will also work to identify\nindustrial spaces and vacant sites that can double as alternative farming\nspaces.\n\nFrom next month, the SFA will launch a tender for rooftop spaces on HDB multi-\nstorey carparks to be used for urban farming.\n\nIn addition, a multi-agency task force, headed by Mr Masagos, has also been\nformed to drive inter-agency efforts. The taskf orce will address challenges\nin the setting up and expansion of farms and ensure that the farms are highly\nproductive, sustainable and resilient, said the agencies.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * [AGRICULTURE AND FARMING](/tags/agriculture-and-farming)\n  * [GRANTS AND FUNDS](/tags/grants-and-funds)\n  * [SINGAPORE FOOD AGENCY](/tags/singapore-food-agency)\n  * [MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER RESOURCES](/tags/ministry-of-the-environment-and-water-resources)\n\n_More_\n\nLinkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print [Purchase Article\n](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=Coronavirus:\nNew $30m grant launched to speed up local production of eggs, vegetables and\nfish)\n\nPermalink: https://str.sg/JgSS Copy\n\n[](https://newspost.newslink.sg/?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=Coronavirus:\nNew $30m grant launched to speed up local production of eggs, vegetables and\nfish)\n\n[](http://newslink.asiaone.com/ips/NewsPostEnquiryRequest.action?publication=ST&date=04/08/2020&title=Coronavirus:\nNew $30m grant launched to speed up local production of eggs, vegetables and\nfish)\n\n## Branded Content\n\n#### Subscribe to The Straits Times\n\ncall 6388-3838 or [click\nhere](https://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/?r=products/newsubscriptionpackages&pcode=st&utm_campaign=st_subscription&utm_medium=web&utm_source=st&utm_content=subscribetext-\nclickherefooter&utm_term=coronavirus-new-30m-grant-launched-to-speed-up-local-\nproduction-of-eggs-vegetables-and)\n\n[Available for  \niPhones and iPads](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/the-straits-times-for-\niphone/id547465441?mt=8)\n\n[Available in  \nGoogle Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buuuk.st&hl=en)\n\nBack to the top ![](/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/arrow-up.svg)\n\n  * [Singapore](/singapore)\n  * [Politics](/politics)\n  * [Asia](/asia)\n\n  * [World](/world)\n  * [Videos](/videos)\n  * [Multimedia](/multimedia)\n\n  * [Lifestyle](/lifestyle)\n  * [Food](/lifestyle/food)\n  * [Forum](/forum)\n\n  * [Opinion](/opinion)\n  * [Business](/business)\n  * [Sport](/sport)\n\n  * [Tech](/tech)\n  * [Games](/lifestyle/play-sudoku-crosswords-and-more-with-new-st-games)\n\n## Follow ST\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/stcom)\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes)\n  * [](http://www.pinterest.com/thestraitstimes)\n  * [](http://instagram.com/straits_times)\n  * [](/RSS-Feeds)\n\n## The Straits Times\n\n[Terms & Conditions](http://sph.com.sg/legal/website_tnc.html)[Data Protection\nPolicy](http://sph.com.sg/legal/pdpa.html)Need help?
